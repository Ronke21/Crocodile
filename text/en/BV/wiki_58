<text>Gustav Wilhelm Ludwig von Struve (November 1, 1858 – November 4, 1920) was a Baltic German astronomer, part of the famous Baltic German Struve family. In Russian, his name is sometimes given as Lyudvig Ottovich Struve (Людвиг Оттович Струве) or Lyudvig Ottonovich Struve (Людвиг Оттонович Струве).

==Biography==
Gustav Wilhelm Ludwig von Struve was born in 1858 in Tsarskoye Selo – a former Russian residence of the imperial family and visiting nobility, located south from the center of St. Petersburg. He was the fourth son of Otto Wilhelm von Struve and Emilie Dyrssen (1823–1868) and a younger brother of astronomer Hermann Struve. Ludwig followed his family traditions and between 1876 and 1880 studied astronomy at the Imperial University of Dorpat. For his post-graduate research started at the Pulkovo Observatory which was headed by his father. In 1883, Ludwig defended his PhD thesis on &quot;Resultate aus den in Pulkowa angestellen Vergleichungen von Procyon mit benachbarten Sternen&quot; (Results obtained in Pulkovo on relation of Procyon with the neighboring stars). Between 1883 and 1886, Struve was staying abroad in several European observatories, including those in Bonn, Milan, Paris and Leipzig. His major influences in astronomy were his father and the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli. Between 1886 and 1894, Struve worked as an astronomer at the Tartu Observatory. In 1887, using results obtained during his European trip, he prepared and defended the habilitation thesis titled &quot;Neue Bestimmung der Constante der Precession und der eigenen Bewegung des Sonnensystems&quot; (New determination of the constant of precession and of the motion of the Solar System).

==Research==

A few years after retirement of his father, in 1894, Ludwig moved to the University of Kharkiv. There, in 1897 he became professor in astronomy and geodesy and director of the observatory. Prior to Struve, the Kharkiv Observatory was not registered within the Russian leveling network and the altitude of Kharkiv was based on rather inaccurate trigonometric leveling conducted by local triangulation. It took Struve five years of hard work to include the observatory to the Russian leveling network. In 1912, he was elected as Dean of the Physics and Mathematics Department of Kharkiv University. In 1914, he founded a workshop of fine mechanics at the department and headed it for five years. Prior to that, such institutions had been nonexistent in Russia, and foreign engineers were personally invited for precision mechanical work. Struve attempted to build a national school in this area, but with limited success. He himself was a skilled engineer and constructed an instrument for the measurement of &quot;an individual error using artificial star.” This device was invented by H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen at the Leiden Observatory and was actively used by Struve.

Struve&#x27;s research was first focused on celestial mechanics, in particular precession and other motion within the Solar System. It then expanded on the study of the positions and motion of stars, in particular single and double stars lying within the angular range of the Tartu Observatory. He used occultation of stars by the Moon to refine the value of the lunar radius. He also determined the apex coordinates of the Sun&#x27;s movement and was one of the first astronomers to estimate, in 1887, the rotation rate of the Milky Way.

On the basis of his observations in Kharkiv, Struve compiled a catalogue &quot;Observation of 779 zodiac stars” (1898–1902). Between 1908 and 1915, Struve with collaborators determined right ascension and declination of 1407 circumpolar stars, taking about 11,000 observations for each coordinate. The results were published in the &quot;Kharkiv differential catalogue of declination of 1407 circumpolar stars in FK4 system for mean epoch of 1911 year&quot; and &quot;The
results of a comparison of the catalogue of declination of 1407 circumpolar stars and the Fabritius catalogue with the tables of proper motion of 412 circumpolar stars&quot;.

==Late years==
Struve was married to Elizaveta Khrystoforovna (1874–1964) and they had two sons and two daughters. Their first child, son Otto, was born in Kharkiv in 1897, and later became one of the most famous astronomers of the 20th century. Otto served as a White Russian officer in the losing side of the civil war that followed the Russian Revolution. Therefore, to avoid Bolshevik&#x27;s repressions, Struve had to move in 1919 to Simferopol where he had assumed professor position at the Tavrida University. He left in Kharkiv a collection of about 1400 historical letters involving his father and grandfather, Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve. The collection had survived two wars and was preserved till the present days.

After leaving Kharkiv, tragedy struck the Struve family with three deaths in the over the course of five months. In the summer of 1920, Ludwig&#x27;s 9-year-old daughter Elizabeth drowned in front of him. Shortly afterward, his son Werner (1903–1920) died from tuberculosis, and in November, Ludwig himself died of a stroke. He was survived by his wife and daughter Yadviga (1901–1924), who returned to Kharkiv. Yadviga had taught German at Kharkiv Technology Institute, but died in 1924 of tuberculosis.

==Awards==
In 1915, Struve received an award from the council of the Russian Astronomical Society, where he was a member from 1893. The award was given for his work “Elaboration of the observations of
lunar occultation of the stars during the total lunar eclipse” that was carried within a collaboration between the Kharkiv and Pulkovo observatories.

<text>The Chechens ( ; , , Old Chechen: Нахчой, &quot;Naxçoy&quot;), historically also known as &quot;Kisti&quot; and &quot;Durdzuks&quot;, are a Northeast Caucasian ethnic group of the Nakh peoples native to the North Caucasus. They are the largest ethnic group in the region and refer to themselves as Nokhchiy (; singular Nokhchi, Nokhcho, Nakhchuo or Nakhche). The vast majority of Chechens are Muslims and live in Chechnya, an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation.

The North Caucasus has been invaded numerous times throughout history. Its isolated terrain and the strategic value outsiders have placed on the areas settled by Chechens has contributed much to the Chechen community ethos and helped shape its national character.

Chechen society is largely egalitarian and organized around tribal autonomous local clans, called teips, informally organized into loose confederations called tukkhums.

==Etymology==

===Chechen===
According to popular tradition, the Russian term &quot;Chechency&quot; (Чеченцы) comes from central Chechnya, which had several important villages and towns named after the word &quot;Chechen&quot;. These places include Chechan, Nana-Checha (&quot;Mother Checha&quot;) and Yokkh Chechen (&quot;Greater Chechena&quot;). The name &quot;Chechen&quot; occurs in Russian sources in the late 16th century as &quot;Chachana&quot;, which is mentioned as a land owned by the Chechen Prince Shikh Murza. The etymology is of Nakh origin and originates from the word &quot;Che&quot; (&quot;inside&quot;) attached to the suffix -&quot; cha&quot;/&quot;chan&quot;, which altogether can be translated as &quot;inside territory&quot;. The villages and towns named Chechan were always situated in the &quot;Chechan-are&quot; (&quot;Chechen flatlands or plains&quot;) located in contemporary central Chechnya.

The name &quot;Chechens&quot; is an exoethnonym that entered the Georgian and Western European ethnonymic tradition through the Russian language in the 18th century.

From the middle of the 19th century to the first few years of the Soviet state, some researchers united all Chechens and Ingush under the name &quot;Chechens&quot;. In modern science, another term is used for this community — &quot;the Vainakh people&quot;.

===Nokhchiy===
Although &quot;Chechan&quot; (Chechen) was a term used by Chechens to denote a certain geographic area (central Chechnya), Chechens called themselves &quot;Nakhchiy&quot; (highland dialects) or &quot;Nokhchiy&quot; (lowland dialects). The oldest mention of &quot;Nakhchiy&quot; occurred in 1310 by the Georgian Patriarch Cyril Donauri, who mentions the &#x27;People of Nakhche&#x27; among Tushetians, Avars and many other Northeast Caucasian nations. The term &quot;Nakhchiy&quot; has also been connected to the city Nakhchivan and the nation of Nakhchamatyan (mentioned as one of the peoples of Sarmatia in the 7th-century Armenian work &quot;Ashkharhatsuyts&quot;) by many Soviet and modern historians, although the historian N. Volkova considers the latter connection unlikely and states that the term Nakhchmatyan could have been mistaken for the &quot;Iaxamatae&quot;, a tribe of Sarmatia mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot; Geography&quot;, who have no connection to the Chechen people. Chechen manuscripts in Arabic from the early 1820s do mention a certain &quot;Nakhchuvan&quot; (near modern-day Kağızman, Turkey) as the homeland of all Nakhchiy. The etymology of the term &quot;Nakhchiy&quot; can also be understood as a compound formed with &quot;Nakh&quot; (&#x27;people&#x27;) attached to &quot;Chuo&quot; (&#x27;territory&#x27;).

==Geography and diaspora==

The Chechens are mainly inhabitants of Chechnya. There are also significant Chechen populations in other subdivisions of Russia, especially in Aukh (part of modern-day Dagestan), Ingushetia and Moscow.
Outside Russia, countries with significant diaspora populations are Kazakhstan, Turkey and Arab states (especially Jordan and Iraq). Those in Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan are mainly descendants of families who had to leave Chechnya during the Caucasus War, which led to the annexation of Chechnya by the Russian Empire in 1859, and the forcible transfer of Chechens from Terek Oblast to the Ottoman Empire in 1865. Those in Kazakhstan originate from the ethnic cleansing of the entire population carried out by Joseph Stalin and Lavrentiy Beria in 1944. Tens of thousands of Chechen refugees settled in the European Union and elsewhere as the result of the recent Chechen Wars, especially in the wave of emigration to the West after 2002.

==History==

=== Prehistory and origin ===

The Chechens are one of the Nakh peoples, who have lived in the highlands of the North Caucasus region since prehistory. There is archeological evidence of historical continuity dating back to 3000 B.C. as well as evidence pointing to their ancestors&#x27; migration from the Fertile Crescent c. 10,000–8,000 B.C.

The discussion of their origins is intertwined with the discussion of the mysterious origins of Nakh peoples as a whole. The only three surviving Nakh peoples are Chechens, Ingush and Bats, but they are thought by some scholars to be the remnants of what was once a larger family of peoples.

They are thought to be descended from the original settlers of the Caucasus (North and/or South).

=== Antiquity ===
Ancestors of the modern Chechens and Ingush were known as Durdzuks. According to &quot;The Georgian Chronicles&quot;, before his death, Targamos [Togarmah] divided the country amongst his sons, with Kavkasos [Caucas] receiving the Central Caucasus. Kavkasos engendered the Chechen tribes, and his descendant, Durdzuk, who took up residence in a mountainous region, later called &quot;Dzurdzuketia&quot; after him, established a strong state in the fourth and third centuries BC. Among the Chechen teips, the teip Zurzakoy, consonant with the ethnonym Dzurdzuk, lives in the Itum-Kale region of Chechnya.

Georgian historian Giorgi Melikishvili posited that although there was evidence of Nakh settlement in the Southern Caucasus areas, this did not rule out the possibility that they also lived in the North Caucasus.

The state of Durdzuketi has been recorded since the 4th century BC. &quot;The Armenian Chronicles&quot; mention that the Durdzuks defeated the Scythians and became a significant power in the region in the first millennium BC.

The Vainakh in the east had an affinity with Georgia, while the Malkh Kingdom of the west looked to the new Greek kingdom of Bosporus on the Black Sea coast (though it may have also had relations with Georgia). According to legend, Adermalkh, chief of the Malkh state, married the daughter of the Bosporan king in 480 BCE. Malkhi is one of the Chechen tukkhums.

=== Medieval ===
During the Middle Ages, the lowland of Chechnya was dominated by the Khazars and then the Alans. Local culture was also subject to Georgian influence and some Chechens converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity. With a presence dating back to the 14th century, Islam gradually spread among the Chechens, although the Chechens&#x27; own pagan religion was still strong until the 19th century. Society was organised along feudal lines. Chechnya was devastated by the Mongol invasions of the 13th century and those of Tamerlane in the 14th. The Mongol invasions are well known in Chechen folktales which are often connected with military reports of Alan-Dzurdzuk wars against the Mongols.

According to the missionary Pian de Carpine, a part of the Alans had successfully resisted a Mongol siege on a mountain for 12 years:

This twelve-year-old siege is not found in any other report, however, the Russian historian A. I. Krasnov connected this battle with two Chechen folktales he recorded in 1967 that spoke of an old hunter named Idig who with his companions defended the Dakuoh mountain for 12 years against Tatar-Mongols. He also reported to have found several arrowheads and spears from the 13th century near the very mountain the battle took place at:


Tamerlane&#x27;s late 14th-century invasions of the Caucasus were especially costly to the Chechen kingdom of Simsir which was an ally of the Golden Horde and anti-Timurid. Its leader Khour Ela supported Khan Tokhtamysh during the Battle of the Terek River.
The Chechens bear the distinction of being one of the few peoples to successfully resist the Mongols and defend themselves against their invasions; not once, but twice, though this came at great cost to them, as their states were utterly destroyed. These events were key in the shaping of the Chechen nationhood and their martial-oriented and clan-based society.

=== Early modern period ===

The Caucasus was a major competing area for two neighboring rival empires: the Ottoman and Turco-Persian empires (Safavids, Afsharids, Qajars). Starting from 1555 and decisively from 1639 through the first half of the 19th century, the Caucasus was divided by these two powers, with the Ottomans prevailing in Western Georgia, while Persia kept the bulk of the Caucasus, namely Eastern Georgia, Southern Dagestan, Azerbaijan, and Armenia. The Chechens, however, never really fell under the rule of either empire. As Russia expanded slowly southwards as early as the 16th century, clashes between Chechens and Russians became more frequent, and it became three empires competing for the region. During these turbulent times, the Chechens were organized into semi-independent clans that were loyal to the Mehk-Khel (National Council). The Mehk-Khel was in charge of appointing the Mehk-Da (ruler of the nation). Several of these appeared during the late Middle Ages such as Aldaman Gheza, Tinavin-Visa, Zok-K&#x27;ant and others. The administration and military expeditions commanded by Aldaman Gheza during the 1650–1670s led to Chechnya being largely untouched by the major empires of the time. Alliances were concluded with local lords against Persian encroachment and battles were fought to stop Russian influence. One such battle was the Battle of Khachara between Gheza and the rival Avar Khanate that tried to exert influence on Chechnya. As Russia set off to increase its political influence in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea at the expense of Safavid Persia, Peter I launched the Russo-Persian War, in which Russia succeeded in taking much of the Caucasian territories for several years. The conflict notably marked the first military encounter between Imperial Russia and the Chechens. Sheikh Mansur led a major Chechen resistance movement in the late 18th century.
In the late 18th and 19th centuries, Russia embarked on full-scale conquest of the North Caucasus in the Caucasian War. Much of the campaign was led by General Yermolov who particularly disliked the Chechens, describing them as &quot;a bold and dangerous people&quot;. Angered by Chechen raids, Yermolov resorted to a brutal policy of &quot;scorched earth&quot; and deportations; he also founded the fort of Grozny (now the capital of Chechnya) in 1818. Chechen resistance to Russian rule reached its peak under the leadership of the Dagestani leader Imam Shamil. The Chechens were finally defeated in 1861 after a bloody war that lasted for decades, during which they lost most of their entire population. In the aftermath, large numbers of refugees also emigrated or were forcibly deported to the Ottoman Empire.

=== Nineteenth and twentieth centuries ===


Since then, there have been various Chechen rebellions against Russian/Soviet power in 1865–66, 1877, during the Russian Civil War and World War II, as well as nonviolent resistance to Russification and the Soviet Union&#x27;s collectivization and anti-religion campaigns. In 1944, all Chechens, together with several other peoples of the Caucasus, were ordered by the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin to be deported &quot;en masse&quot; to the Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs; and their republic and nation were abolished. At least one-quarter—and perhaps half—of the entire Chechen population perished in the process, and a severe blow was made to their culture and historical records. Though &quot;rehabilitated&quot; in 1956 and allowed to return the next year, the survivors lost economic resources and civil rights and, under both Soviet and post-Soviet governments, they have been the objects of both official and unofficial discrimination and discriminatory public discourse. Chechen attempts to regain independence in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union led to the first and the second war with the new Russian state, starting in 1994.

==Language==
The main language of the Chechen people is Chechen. Chechen belongs to the family of Nakh languages (Northeast Caucasian languages). Literary Chechen is based on the central lowland dialect. Other related languages include Ingush, which has speakers in the neighbouring Ingushetia, and Batsbi, which is the language of the people in the adjoining part of Georgia. At various times in their history, Chechens used Georgian, Arabic and Latin alphabets; as of 2008, the official script is Russian Cyrillic. Traditionally, linguists attributed both Ingush and Batsbi to the Chechen language (as its dialects) before the endoethnonym Vainakh appeared at the beginning of the 20th century.

Most Chechens living in their homeland can understand Ingush with ease. The two languages are not truly mutually intelligible, but it is easy for Chechens to learn how to understand the Ingush language and vice versa over time after hearing it for a while.

In 1989, 73.4% spoke Russian, though this figure has declined due to the wars for a large number of reasons (including the lack of proper education, the refusal to learn the language, and the mass dispersal of the Chechen diaspora due to the war). Chechens in the diaspora often speak the language of the country they live in (English, French, German, Arabic, Polish, Georgian, Turkish, etc.).

The Nakh languages are a subgroup of Northeast Caucasian, and as such are related to Nakho-Dagestanian family, including the languages of the Avars, Dargins, Lezghins, Laks, Rutulians, etc.
However, this relationship is not a close one: the Nakho-Dagestani family is of comparable or greater time-depth than Indo-European, meaning Chechens are only as linguistically related to Avars or Dargins as the French are to the Russians or Iranians.

Some researchers suggest a linguistic relationship between the Nakhsk-Dagestani languages and the Urarto-Hurrians.

Other scholars, however, doubt that the language families are related, or believe that, while a connection is possible, the evidence is far from conclusive. Uralicist and Indo-Europeanist Petri Kallio argues that the matter is hindered by the lack of consensus about how to reconstruct Proto-Northeast-Caucasian, but that Alarodian is the most promising proposal for relations with Northeast Caucasian, greater than rival proposals to link it with Northwest Caucasian or other families. However, nothing is known about Alarodians except that they &quot;were armed like the Colchians and Saspeires,&quot; according to Herodotus. Colchians and Saspeires are generally associated with Kartvelians or Scythians. Additionally, leading Urartologist Paul Zimansky rejected a connection between Urartians and Alarodians.

==Genetics==

Genetic tests on Chechens have shown roots mostly in the Caucasus and Europe. Studies on North Caucasian mtDNA indicated a closer relationship of the Caucasus with Europe (Nasidze et al. 2001), while the Y chromosome indicated a closer relationship with West Asia (Nasidze et al. 2003).

A 2004 study of the mtDNA showed Chechens to be diverse in the mitochondrial genome, with 18 different haplogroups out of only 23 samples. This correlates with all other North Caucasian peoples such as the Ingush, Avars, and Circassians where the mitochondrial DNA is very diverse.

The most recent study on Chechens, by Balanovsky &quot;et al.&quot; in 2011, sampled a total of 330 Chechens from three sample locations (one in Malgobek, one in Achkhoy-Martan, and one from two sites in Dagestan) and found the following frequencies: A weak majority of Chechens belong to Haplogroup J2 (56.7%), which is associated with Mediterranean, Caucasian and Fertile Crescent populations. Other notable values were found among North Caucasian Turkic peoples (Kumyks (25%) and Balkars (24%)). It is notable that J2 suddenly collapses as one enters the territory of non-Nakh Northeast Caucasian peoples, dropping to very low values among Dagestani peoples. The overwhelming bulk of Chechen J2 is of the subclade J2a4b* (J2-M67), of which the highest frequencies by far are found among Nakh peoples: Chechens were 55.2% according to the Balanovsky study, while Ingush were 87.4%. Other notable haplogroups that consistently appeared at high frequencies included J1 (20.9%), L (7.0%), G2 (5.5%), R1a (3.9%), Q-M242 (3%) and R1b-M269 (1.8%, but much higher in Chechnya itself as opposed to Dagestani or Ingushetian Chechens). Overall, tests have shown consistently that Chechens are most closely related to Ingush, Circassians and other North Caucasians, occasionally showing a kinship to other peoples in some tests. Balanovsky&#x27;s study showed the Ingush to be the Chechens&#x27; closest relatives by far.

Russian military historian and Lieutenant General Vasily Potto describes the appearance of the Chechens as follows: &quot;The Chechen is handsome and strong. Tall, brunette, slender, with sharp features and a quick, determined look, he amazes with his mobility, agility, dexterity.&quot;

According to a 2021 Rosstat study Chechnya ranked as the tallest region in Russia for men (179.1 cm) and second tallest for women (168.2), similar to that of Lithuania and Poland.

==Culture==
Prior to the adoption of Islam, the Chechens practiced a unique blend of religious traditions and beliefs. Their code of honor is known as &quot;quonahalla&quot;. They partook in numerous rites and rituals, many of them pertaining to farming; these included rain rites, a celebration that occurred on the first day of plowing, as well as the Day of the Thunderer Sela and the Day of the Goddess Tusholi. In addition to sparse written record from the Middle Ages, Chechens traditionally remember history through the &quot;illesh&quot;, a collection of epic poems and stories.

 Chechens are accustomed to democratic ways, their social structure being firmly based on equality, pluralism and deference to individuality. Chechen society is structured around &quot;tukkhums&quot; (unions of clans) and about 130 &quot;teips&quot;, or clans. The teips are based more on land and one-side lineage than on blood (as exogamy is prevalent and encouraged), and are bonded together to form the Chechen nation. Teips are further subdivided into &quot;gar&quot; (branches), and gars into &quot;nekye&quot; (patronymic families). The Chechen social code is called &quot;nokhchallah&quot; (where &quot;Nokhchuo&quot; stands for &quot;Chechen&quot;) and may be loosely translated as &quot;Chechen character&quot;. The Chechen code of honor and customary law (adat) implies moral and ethical behaviour, generosity and the will to safeguard the honor of women. The traditional Chechen saying goes that the members of Chechen society, like its teips, are (ideally) &quot;free and equal like wolves&quot;.

Chechens have a strong sense of community, which is enforced by the old clan network and &quot;nokhchalla&quot; – the obligation to clan, tukkhum, etc. This is often combined with old values transmuted into a modern sense. They are mythically descended from the epic hero, Turpalo-Nokhchuo (&quot;Chechen Hero&quot;). There is a strong theme of representing the nation with its national animal, the wolf. Due to their strong dependence on the land, its farms and its forests (and indeed, the national equation with the wolf), Chechens have a strong affection for nature. According to Chechen philosopher Apty Bisultanov, ruining an ant-hill or hunting Caucasian goats during their mating season was considered extremely sinful. The glasnost era Chechen independence movement &quot;Bart&quot; (unity) originated as a simple environmentalist organization in the republic&#x27;s capital of Grozny.

Chechen culture strongly values freedom. This asserts itself in multiple ways. A large majority of the nation&#x27;s national heroes fought for independence (or otherwise, like the legendary Zelimkhan, robbed from the Russian oppressors in order to feed Chechen children in a Robin Hood-like fashion). A common greeting in the Chechen language, &quot;marsha oylla&quot;, is literally translated as &quot;enter in freedom&quot;. The word for freedom also encompasses notions of peace and prosperity.

==Religion==
Chechnya is predominantly Sunni Muslim. Most of the population follows either the Shafi&#x27;i or the Hanafi schools of jurisprudence, fiqh. The Shafi&#x27;i school has a long tradition among the Chechens, and thus it remains the most practiced. Some adhere to the mystical Sufi tradition of muridism, while about half of Chechens belong to Sufi brotherhoods, or &quot;tariqah&quot;. The two Sufi tariqas that spread in the North Caucasus were the Naqshbandiyya and the Qadiriyya (the Naqshbandiyya is particularly strong in Dagestan and eastern Chechnya, whereas the Qadiriyya has most of its adherents in the rest of Chechnya and Ingushetia). There are also small Christian and atheist minorities, although their numbers are unknown in Chechnya; in Kazakhstan, they are roughly 3% and 2% of the Chechen population respectively.

A stereotype of an average Chechen being a fundamentalist Muslim is incorrect and misleading. By the late 2000s, however, two new trends have emerged in Chechnya. A radicalized remnant of the armed Chechen separatist movement has become dominated by Salafis (popularly known in Russia as Wahhabis and present in Chechnya in small numbers since the 1990s), mostly abandoning nationalism in favor of Pan-Islamism and merging with several other regional Islamic insurgencies to form the Caucasus Emirate. At the same time, Chechnya under Moscow-backed authoritarian rule of Ramzan Kadyrov has undergone its own controversial counter-campaign of Islamization of the republic, with the government and the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of the Chechen Republic actively promoting and enforcing their own version of a so-called &quot;traditional Islam&quot;, including introducing elements of Sharia that replaced Russian official laws.

<text>San Juan del Puerto was a Spanish Franciscan mission founded before 1587 on Fort George Island, near the mouth of the St. Johns River in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. It was founded to serve the Saturiwa, a Timucua tribe who lived around the mouth of the St. Johns. It was organized by separating them into nine smaller villages. It has an important place in the study of the Timucua, as the place where Francisco Pareja undertook his work on the Timucua language.

==History==
The Saturiwa were one of the chiefdoms of the Mocama, the Timucua-speaking people who lived in the coastal areas of what is now northern Florida and southeastern Georgia. The Saturiwa were allied with the French of Fort Caroline, and were thus initially hostile to the Spanish – who ousted the French colonists from the Florida coast in 1565. However, the Saturiwa soon made peace with the Spaniards, and &quot;Misión San Juan&quot; was founded near their main town on Fort George Island prior to 1587.

This became one of the three principal missions in what the Spanish called the Mocama Province, together with San Pedro de Mocama (to the Tacatacuru) on Cumberland Island and Santa Maria de Sena between them on Amelia Island.

Father Francisco Pareja worked at this mission and at San Pedro de Mocama. He devised a system of writing for Timucuan and taught some of the Mocama. In 1612, he printed a catechism in Spanish and Timucua, the first book printed in an indigenous language of the Americas.

After 1650, Guale refugees from the next chiefdom to the north along the (present-day) Georgia coast were settled at the mission.

The Spanish abandoned the mission around 1702, partly in response to raids from Native Americans and allied English colonists from South Carolina during Queen Anne&#x27;s War.

<text>Margaret Rumer Godden (10 December 1907 – 8 November 1998) was a British author of more than 60 fiction and non-fiction books. Nine of her works have been made into films, most notably &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; in 1947 and &quot;The River&quot; in 1951.

A few of her works were co-written with her elder sister, novelist Jon Godden, including &quot;Two Under the Indian Sun&quot;, a memoir of the Goddens&#x27; childhood in a region of India now part of Bangladesh.

==Early life==

Godden was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, England. She grew up with her three sisters in Narayanganj, colonial India (now in Bangladesh), where her father, a shipping company executive, worked for the Brahmaputra Steam Navigation Company. Her parents sent the girls to England for schooling, as was the custom of the time, but brought them back to Narayanganj when the First World War began. 

Godden returned to the United Kingdom with her sisters to continue her interrupted schooling in 1920, spending time at Moira House School in Eastbourne and eventually training as a dance teacher. She went back to Calcutta in 1925 and opened a dance school for English and Indian children. Godden ran the school for 20 years with the help of her sister Nancy. During this time she published her first best-seller, the 1939 novel &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;.

==Writing career==

In 1942, after eight years in an unhappy marriage (one she entered into in 1934 because she was pregnant), she moved with her two daughters, Jane and Paula, (her husband Laurence Foster having joined the army) to Kashmir, living first on a houseboat and then in a rented house where she started a farm. The novel &quot;Kingfishers Catch Fire&quot; was based on her time in Kashmir. After a mysterious incident in which it appeared that an attempt had been made to poison both her and her daughters, she returned to Calcutta in 1944. She returned to the United Kingdom in 1945 to concentrate on her writing, frequently moving house but living mostly in Sussex and London. She was divorced in 1948. After returning from America to oversee the script for the movie of her book &quot;The River&quot;, Godden married civil servant James Haynes Dixon on 26November 1949.

In the early 1950s Godden became interested in the Catholic Church, though she did not officially convert until 1968, and several of her later novels contain sympathetic portrayals of Catholic priests and nuns. In addition to &quot;Black Narcissus&quot;, two of her books deal with the subject of women in religious communities. In &quot;Five for Sorrow, Ten for Joy&quot; and &quot;In This House of Brede&quot; she acutely examined the balance between the mystical, spiritual aspects of religion and the practical, human realities of religious life.

A number of Godden&#x27;s novels are set in India, the atmosphere of which she evokes through all the senses; her writing is vivid with detail of smells, textures, light, flowers, noises and tactile experiences. Her books for children, especially her several doll stories, strongly convey the secret thoughts, confusions, disappointments and aspirations of childhood. Her plots often involve unusual young people not recognised for their talents by ordinary lower- or middle-class people but supported by the educated, rich, and upper-class, to the anger, resentment, and puzzlement of their relatives. She won a 1972 Whitbread award for &quot;The Diddakoi&quot;, a young adult novel about Gypsies, televised by the BBC as &quot;Kizzy&quot;.

==Later life and death==
In 1968 she took the tenancy of Lamb House in Rye, East Sussex, where she lived until the death of her husband in 1973. She moved to Moniaive in Dumfriesshire in 1978, when she was 70, to be near her daughter Jane. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1993. She visited India once more, in 1994, returning to Kashmir for the filming of a BBC &quot;Bookmark&quot; documentary about her life and books.

Rumer Godden died on 8 November 1998 at the age of 90 after a series of strokes; her ashes were buried with those of her second husband in Rye.

<text>Salacca is a genus of about 20 species of palms native to Southeast Asia and the eastern Himalayas. They are dioecious (with the exception of Salak Bali) and pollinated by Curculionidae beetles.

They are very short-stemmed palms, with leaves up to 6–8 m long. The leaves have a spiny petiole; in most species they are pinnate with numerous leaflets, but some species, notably &quot;S. magnifica&quot;, have undivided leaves. The fruit grow in clusters at the base of the plants, and are edible in many species, with a reddish-brown scaly skin covering a white pulp and one to two large inedible seeds. The Salak (&quot;S. zalacca&quot;) or snake fruit is the species most widely grown for its fruit; the firm white pulp has a slight acidic taste. The skin of the snakefruit has a unique texture not unlike that of a snake&#x27;s skin, rough to the touch in one direction but smooth in the other.

<text>In music theory, the scale degree is the position of a particular note on a scale relative to the tonic—the first and main note of the scale from which each octave is assumed to begin. Degrees are useful for indicating the size of intervals and chords and whether an interval is major or minor.

In the most general sense, the scale degree is the number given to each step of the scale, usually starting with 1 for tonic. Defining it like this implies that a tonic is specified. For instance, the 7-tone diatonic scale may become the major scale once the proper degree has been chosen as tonic (e.g. the C-major scale C–D–E–F–G–A–B, in which C is the tonic). If the scale has no tonic, the starting degree must be chosen arbitrarily. In set theory, for instance, the 12 degrees of the chromatic scale are usually numbered starting from C=0, the twelve pitch classes being numbered from 0 to 11.

In a more specific sense, scale degrees are given names that indicate their particular function within the scale (see table below). This implies a functional scale, as is the case in tonal music.

This example gives the names of the functions of the scale degrees in the seven-note diatonic scale. The names are the same for the major and minor scales, only the seventh degree changes name when flattened:

The term scale step is sometimes used synonymously with scale degree, but it may alternatively refer to the distance &quot;between&quot; two successive and adjacent scale degrees (see steps and skips). The terms &quot;whole step&quot; and &quot;half step&quot; are commonly used as interval names (though &quot;whole scale step&quot; or &quot;half scale step&quot; are not used). The number of scale degrees and the distance between them together define the scale they are in.

In Schenkerian analysis, &quot;scale degree&quot; (or &quot;scale step&quot;) translates Schenker&#x27;s German &quot;Stufe&quot;, denoting &quot;a chord having gained structural significance&quot; (see ).

<doc id="622805" wikidata="Q6982444" url="?curid=622805" title="Navigational database">
<text>A navigational database is a type of database in which records or objects are found primarily by following references from other objects. The term was popularized by the title of Charles Bachman&#x27;s 1973 Turing Award paper, &quot;The Programmer as Navigator&quot;. This paper emphasized the fact that the new disk-based database systems allowed the programmer to choose arbitrary navigational routes following relationships from record to record, contrasting this with the constraints of earlier magnetic-tape and punched card systems where data access was strictly sequential.

One of the earliest navigational databases was Integrated Data Store (IDS), which was developed by Bachman for General Electric in the 1960s. IDS became the basis for the CODASYL database model in 1969.

Although Bachman described the concept of navigation in abstract terms, the idea of navigational access came to be associated strongly with the procedural design of the CODASYL Data Manipulation Language. Writing in 1982, for example, Tsichritzis and Lochovsky state that &quot;The notion of currency is central to the concept of navigation.&quot; By the notion of currency, they refer to the idea that a program maintains (explicitly or implicitly) a current position in any sequence of records that it is processing, and that operations such as codice_1 and codice_2 retrieve records relative to this current position, while also changing the current position to the record that is retrieved.

Navigational database programming thus came to be seen as intrinsically procedural; and moreover to depend on the maintenance of an implicit set of global variables (&quot;currency indicators&quot;) holding the current state. As such, the approach was seen as diametrically opposed to the declarative programming style used by the relational model. The declarative nature of relational languages such as SQL offered better programmer productivity and a higher level of data independence (that is, the ability of programs to continue working as the database structure evolves.) Navigational interfaces, as a result, were gradually eclipsed during the 1980s by declarative query languages.

During the 1990s it started becoming clear that for certain applications handling complex data (for example, spatial databases and engineering databases), the relational calculus had limitations. At that time, a reappraisal of the entire database market began, with several companies describing the new systems using the marketing term NoSQL. Many of these systems introduced data manipulation languages which, while far removed from the CODASYL DML with its currency indicators, could be understood as implementing Bachman&#x27;s &quot;navigational&quot; vision. Some of these languages are procedural; others (such as XPath) are entirely declarative. Offshoots of the navigational concept, such as the graph database, found new uses in modern transaction processing workloads.

==Description==

Navigational access is traditionally associated with the network model and hierarchical model of database, and conventionally describes data manipulation APIs in which records (or objects) are processed one at a time, iteratively. The essential characteristic as described by Bachman, however, is finding records by virtue of their relationship to other records: so an interface can still be navigational if it has set-oriented features. From this viewpoint, the key difference between navigational data manipulation languages and relational languages is the use of explicit named relationships rather than value-based joins: codice_3 versus codice_4. 

In practice, however, most navigational APIs have been procedural: the above query would be executed using procedural logic along the lines of the following pseudo-code:
get department with name=&#x27;Sales&#x27;
get first employee in set department-employees
until end-of-set do {
 get next employee in set department-employees
 process employee


On this viewpoint, the key difference between navigational APIs and the relational model (implemented in relational databases) is that relational APIs use &quot;declarative&quot; or logic programming techniques that ask the system &quot;what&quot; to fetch, while navigational APIs instruct the system in a sequence of steps &quot;how&quot; to reach the required records.

Most criticisms of navigational APIs fall into one of two categories:

* Usability: application code quickly becomes unreadable and difficult to debug
* Data independence: application code needs to change whenever the data structure changes

For many years the primary defence of navigational APIs was performance. Database systems that support navigational APIs often use internal storage structures that contain physical links or pointers from one record to another. While such structures may allow very efficient navigation, they have disadvantages because it becomes difficult to reorganize the physical placement of data. It is quite possible to implement navigational APIs without low-level pointer chasing (Bachman&#x27;s paper envisaged logical relationships being implemented just as in relational systems, using primary keys and foreign keys), so the two ideas should not be conflated. But without the performance benefits of low-level pointers, navigational APIs become harder to justify.

Hierarchical models often construct primary keys for records by concatenating the keys that appear at each level in the hierarchy. Such composite identifiers are found in computer file names (codice_5), in URIs, in the Dewey decimal system, and for that matter in postal addresses. Such a composite key can be considered as representing a navigational path to a record; but equally, it can be considered as a simple primary key allowing associative access.

As relational systems came to prominence in the 1980s, navigational APIs (and in particular, procedural APIs) were criticized and fell out of favour. The 1990s, however, brought a new wave of object-oriented databases that often provided both declarative and procedural interfaces. One explanation for this is that they were often used to represent graph-structured information (for example spatial data and engineering data) where access is inherently recursive: the mathematics underpinning SQL (specifically, first-order predicate calculus) does not have sufficient power to support recursive queries, even those as simple as a transitive closure.

A current example of a popular navigational API can be found in the Document Object Model (DOM) often used in web browsers and closely associated with JavaScript. The DOM is essentially an in-memory hierarchical database with an API that is both procedural and navigational. By contrast, the same data (XML or HTML) can be accessed using XPath, which can be categorized as declarative and navigational: data is accessed by following relationships, but the calling program does not issue a sequence of instructions to be followed in order. Languages such as SPARQL used to retrieve Linked Data from the Semantic Web are also simultaneously declarative and navigational.

<text>These are the main rivers that flow wholly or partially in Belgium or have Belgian tributaries.

All of Belgium is drained into the North Sea, except the municipality of Momignies (Macquenoise), which is drained by the river Oise into the English Channel. Rivers that flow into the sea are sorted alphabetically. Rivers that flow into other rivers are sorted by the proximity of their points of confluence to the sea. Some rivers (e.g. Moselle, Rhine, Seine) do not flow through Belgium themselves, but they are mentioned for having Belgian tributaries. They are given in &quot;italics&quot;. Below, the Belgian rivers are given alphabetically. See also :Category:Rivers of Belgium. If the names are different in French, Dutch or German, they are given in parentheses (only given if the river flows in French, Dutch or German-speaking territory). 
Note for additions: Please remember to add the city where the river meets for each river. For an alphabetical overview of rivers of Belgium, see the category :Category:Rivers of Belgium.

<text>The de Havilland DH.88 Comet is a British two-seat, twin-engined aircraft built by the de Havilland Aircraft Company. It was developed specifically to participate in the 1934 England-Australia MacRobertson Air Race from the United Kingdom to Australia.

Development of the Comet was seen as both a prestige project and an entry into the use of modern techniques. It was designed to meet the specific requirements of the race. It was the first British aircraft to incorporate in one airframe all the elements of the modern high speed aircraft - stressed-skin construction, cantilever monoplane flying surfaces, retractable undercarriage, landing flaps, variable-pitch propellers and an enclosed cockpit.

Three Comets were produced for the race, all for private owners, at the discounted price of £5,000 per aircraft. The aircraft had a rapid development process, performing its maiden flight only six weeks before the race. Comet G-ACSS &quot;Grosvenor House&quot; eventually won the race. Another two Comets were built after the race. Comets established many aviation records, both during the race and afterwards, and also took part in further races. Three were bought and evaluated by national governments, typically as mail planes. Two Comets, &quot;G-ACSS&quot; and &quot;G-ACSP&quot;, survived while a number of full-scale replicas have also been constructed.

==Development==
===Background: The Great Air Race===
During 1933, the MacRobertson Air Race, a multi-stage flight from the United Kingdom to Australia, was being planned for October 1934, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Australian State of Victoria. Sponsored by Macpherson Robertson, an Australian confectionery manufacturer, the race would be flown in stages from England to Melbourne.

The new generation of monoplane airliners which were then being developed in America had no rival in Britain at the time, so Geoffrey de Havilland, a British aviation pioneer and founder of aircraft manufacturing firm de Havilland, was determined that, for the sake of national prestige, Britain should put up a serious competitor. While the company board recognised that there would be no prospect of recouping the full investment of producing such a machine, they believed that the project would enhance the company&#x27;s prestige and also provide experience in the development of fast monoplanes.

They therefore announced in January 1934 that, if three orders could be obtained by 28 February, a specialist racer which could achieve a guaranteed speed of to be named the &quot;Comet&quot; would be built and sold for £5,000 each, . This price was estimated as being half of the cost of manufacture. Three orders were received by the deadline; one from Jim Mollison, to be flown by him and his wife Amy (better known as Amy Johnson), one from Arthur Edwards, a hotel owner and manager, and the last from motorcar racer Bernard Rubin.

===Design phase===
Although designed around the requirements for the MacRobertson race, owing to its unusual requirements the Comet did not fit the standard technical specification for a racing aircraft, nevertheless it was classed as a &quot;Special, sub-division (f), Racing or Record&quot;. De Havilland paid special attention to the non-stop range necessary for the long official stages. They initially intended to produce a twin-engined two-seat development of the DH.71 experimental monoplane. However, this would have had inadequate performance so the designer, A. E. Hagg, turned to a more innovative design. This was a cantilever monoplane with enclosed cockpit, retractable undercarriage and flaps. In order to achieve take-off at a reasonable speed with a high all-up weight and a satisfactory high-speed cruise, it would be necessary to fit variable-pitch propellers.

The resulting design had a low, tapered high aspect ratio wing and was powered by two Gipsy Six R engines, a specially-tuned version of the new Gipsy Six. The aircraft was built almost entirely of wood, the use of metal being limited to high-stress components, such as the engine bearers and undercarriage, and to complex curved fairings such as the engine cowlings and wing root fairings. The sheet metal parts used a lightweight magnesium-aluminium alloy. Manually-actuated split flaps were fitted beneath the wing&#x27;s inboard rear sections and lower fuselage, while the Frise ailerons were mass-balanced by lead strips within the aileron&#x27;s leading edges. Both the rudder and elevators fitted to the conventional tail had horn mass balances. In order to validate the wing design, a half-scale model wing was built and tested to destruction. The exterior skin was treated using a time-consuming and repetitive process of painting and rubbing down to produce a highly smooth surface to reduce air friction and increase overall speed.

Aerodynamic efficiency was a design priority and it was therefore decided to use a thin wing of RAF34 section. This was not thick enough to contain spars of sufficient depth to carry the flight loads, so the wing skin had to carry most of the loading in a &quot;stressed-skin&quot; construction. However, the complex curves required for aerodynamic efficiency could not be manufactured using plywood. Hagg, who also had experience as a naval architect, adapted a construction technique previously used for building lifeboats. The majority of the wing was covered using two layers of wide spruce planking laid diagonally across the wing, with the outer layer laid crosswise over the inner. These strips varied in thickness according to the loads they carried, reducing over the span of the wing from at the root to towards the tip. It was built as a single assembly around three box-spars located at 21, 40 and 65 percent chord: there was an intermediate spruce stringer between each pair of spars to prevent buckling. The ribs were made of birch ply and spruce. The outboard were skinned with various thicknesses of ply because of the difficulty of machining spruce planking to less than 0.07 in thickness. The leading edge, forward of the front spar, was also ply covered. The centre section was reinforced with two additional layers of 0.07 in (1.8mm) spruce. This method of construction had been made possible only by the recent development of high-strength synthetic bonding resins and its success took many in the industry by surprise.
The fuselage was built principally from plywood over spruce longerons, while the upper and lower forward section were built up from spruce planking in order to achieve the necessary compound curves. As with the wing, the strength of the structure depended on the skin. Fuel was carried in three fuselage tanks; the two main tanks were in the nose and centre section, in front of the cockpit. A third auxiliary tank, of only 20 gallon capacity, was placed immediately behind the cockpit and could be used to adjust the aircraft&#x27;s trim. The pilot and navigator were seated in tandem in a cockpit set aft of the wing. Although dual flight controls were fitted, only the forward position had a full set of flight instruments. The rear crew member could also see many of the pilot&#x27;s instruments by craning sideways while seated. The cockpit was set low in order to reduce drag and forward visibility was very poor. The engines were uprated versions of de Havilland&#x27;s newly developed Gipsy Six, race-tuned for optimum performance with a higher compression ratio and with a reduced frontal area; the aircraft could maintain an altitude of up to on one engine. The main undercarriage retracted backwards into the engine nacelles and was operated manually, requiring 14 turns of a large handwheel located on the right hand side of the cockpit.

The challenging production schedule meant that flight tests of the DH.88 began just six weeks prior to the start of the race. Hamilton-Standard hydromatic variable-pitch propellers were initially fitted. During testing, the propeller blade roots were found to interfere unacceptably with the airflow into the engine. Instead, a French two-position pneumatically actuated Ratier type was substituted. Its blades were manually set to fine pitch before takeoff using a bicycle pump, and in flight they were repositioned automatically to coarse (high-speed) pitch via a pressure sensor. A drawback was that the propellers could not be reset to fine pitch except on the ground. Other changes included the installation of a large landing light fitted in the nose, and a higher cockpit profile to give the pilot marginally improved visibility.

==Operational history==

===MacRobertson Race===
All three Comets lined up for the start of the race at Mildenhall, a newly established airfield in Suffolk shortly to be handed over to the RAF. G-ACSP was painted black and named &quot;Black Magic&quot;, G-ACSR was green and unnamed and G-ACSS was red and named &quot;Grosvenor House&quot;. The three aircraft took their places among 17 other entrants, which ranged from new high-speed Douglas DC-2 and Boeing 247 airliners to old Fairey Fox biplanes.

====G-ACSP &quot;Black Magic&quot;====
G-ACSP was the only Comet to be flown by its owner. Jim Mollison and his wife Amy and were the first to start, taking off at At 6:30a.m. G-ACSP, named &quot;Black Magic&quot;. to begin a non-stop flight to the first compulsory staging point at Baghdad, the only crew who flew this leg non-stop. Their next stop was at Karachi, landing at 4:53a.m, and setting a new England-India record. They made two unsuccessful attempts to depart, returning after the first when their landing gear failed to retract, and after the second on discovering that they had the wrong map. They finally left Karachi at 9:05p.m. for Allahabad. After drifting off course, they made an unscheduled stop at Jabalpur) to refuel and determine their position. Since there was no aviation fuel available, they had to use motor car petrol provided by a local bus company; a piston seized and an oil line ruptured. They flew on to Allahabad on one engine but, by now needing completely new engines, were forced to retire.

====G-ACSS &quot;Grosvenor House&quot;====
Arthur Edwards named his red Comet G-ACSS after the Grosvenor House Hotel, of which he was the managing director. He engaged C. W. A. Scott and Tom Campbell Black to fly it in the race.

Having landed at Kirkuk to refuel, they arrived at Baghdad after the Mollisons had left but took off again after a half-hour turnaround. Scott and Campbell Black missed out Karachi and flew non-stop to Allahabad where they were told they were the first to arrive, having overtaken the Mollisons. Despite a severe storm over the Bay of Bengal, in which both pilots had to wrestle with the controls together, they reached Singapore safely, eight hours ahead of the DC-2.

They took off for Darwin, losing power in the port engine over the Timor Sea but struggled on to Darwin. While mechanics were working on the engine its designer, Frank Halford, saw a news placard back in England and telephoned through to Darwin. Talking it over he concluded that, despite the warning indicator, they should be able to fly on at reduced power. Despite the setback their lead was now unassailable and after the final mandatory stop and more engine work at Charleville they flew on to cross the finish line at Flemington Racecourse at 3.33 p.m. (local time) on 23 October. Their official time was 70 hours 54 minutes 18 seconds.

====G-ACSR====
The third Comet, G-ACSR, had been painted in British racing green by Bernard Rubin who was a successful motor race driver. He had intended to fly it himself along with Ken Waller but had to pull out at the last minute due to ill health and instead engaged Owen Cathcart Jones to take his place.

On reaching Baghdad, they overshot in the dark, landing by a village when they ran low on fuel. Leaving at first light, they just made it to Baghdad on empty tanks. On taking off again they found that they had a serious oil leak and had to return for repairs. More trouble was encountered on the Darwin leg so they landed at Batavia, They were the fourth aircraft to reach Melbourne, in a time of 108 hours 13 minutes 30 seconds. Cathcart Jones and Waller promptly collected film of the Australian stages of the race and set off the next day to carry it back to Britain. Their return time of 13 days 6 hr 43 min set a new record for a flight from Australia and back..

===After the race===

&quot;Grosvenor House&quot; was dismantled and shipped back to England. It was later bought by the Air Ministry, given the military serial K5084, painted silver overall with RAF markings and flown to RAF Martlesham Heath for evaluation by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment. It made several flights before being written off in a heavy landing and sold for scrap. It was subsequently sold on, rebuilt by Essex Aero and fitted with Gipsy Six series II engines and a castoring tailwheel. In this form it made several race and record attempts under various names. It claimed fourth place in the 1937 Istres-Damascus-Paris race and 12th in the King&#x27;s Cup the next month. Later in the same year it lowered the out-and-home record to the Cape to 5 days 17 hours. In March 1938, A. E. Clouston and Victor Ricketts made a return trip to New Zealand covering in 10 days 21 hours 22 minutes.

The day after they finished the race, Cathcart Jones and Waller took off in G-ACSR for the return journey. Suffering engine trouble at Allahabad, they found the Mollisons still there and were generously given two good pistons from &quot;Black Magic&quot; to allow them to continue. Arriving back in England they had set a new round-trip record of 13 days, 6 hours and 43 minutes. That December, now named &quot;Reine Astrid&quot; in honour of the Belgian queen, G-ACSR flew the Christmas mail from Brussels to Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo. It was then sold to the French government and modified as mail plane F-ANPY, its delivery flight setting a Croydon-Le Bourget record on 5 July 1935. It subsequently made Paris–Casablanca and Paris—Algiers high-speed proving flights with the name Cité d&#x27;Angoulême IV. Formerly believed destroyed alongside F-ANPZ, F-ANPY was last seen in an unflyable condition at Étampes in France in 1940.

&quot;Black Magic&quot; was sold to Portugal for a projected flight from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. Re-registered CS-AAJ and renamed &quot;Salazar&quot; it was damaged on its attempted takeoff at Sintra Air Base for the Atlantic crossing. On a later return flight from Hatfield it made a record flight from London to Lisbon, setting a time of 5 hours 17 minutes in July 1937.

===Other Comets===
Following the French government&#x27;s acquisition of F-ANPY (see above), they ordered a fourth Comet, F-ANPZ, with a mail compartment in the nose. It was later taken on charge by the French Air Force before being destroyed in a hangar fire at Istres in France in June 1940.

The fifth and last Comet, registered G-ADEF and named &quot;Boomerang,&quot; was built for Cyril Nicholson. It was piloted by Tom Campbell Black and J. C. McArthur in an attempt on the London-Cape Town record. It reached Cairo in a record 11 hr, 18 min, but the next leg of the journey was cut short due to oil trouble while in flight over Sudan. On 21 September 1935, Campbell Black and McArthur took off in &quot;Boomerang&quot; from Hatfield in another attempt at the Cape record. The aircraft crashed while flying over Sudan on 22 September 1935 due to propeller problems, the crew escaping by parachute.

==Record flights==
The de Havilland Comets set many record times for long-distance flights during the 1930s, both during races and on special record-breaking flights. Some flights set multiple point-to-point records.

==Surviving aircraft==

G-ACSS was requisitioned for the RAF once again in 1943 but soon passed on to de Havilland. Restored for static display as &quot;Grosvenor House&quot;, it was put on show for the 1951 Festival of Britain. The Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden acquired it in 1965 and then in 1972 re-registered it under its original identity for restoration to flying condition, finally achieved in 1987. It is regarded as &quot;one of the most significant British aircraft still flying.&quot;
CS-AAJ &quot;Salazar&quot; was rediscovered in Portugal after being lost for more than 40 years. It was brought back to the UK and re-registered once again as G-ACSP. As of 2020 restoration continues by the Comet Racer Project Group at the Amy Johnson Comet Restoration Centre, Derby Airfield. The objective is for G-ACSP to fly again in its original livery as &quot;Black Magic&quot;.
==Airworthy reproductions and replicas==
N88XD is a full-scale flying replica Comet. Built in 1993 for Thomas W. Wathen of Santa Barbara, CA by Bill Turner of Repeat Aircraft at Flabob Airport in Rubidoux, California, it wears the livery of G-ACSS &quot;Grosvenor House&quot;.

A replica, originally started by George Lemay in Canada, was acquired by the Croydon Aircraft Company based at Old Mandeville Airfield, near Gore, New Zealand, where it is currently still under construction.

G-RCSR is a reproduction Comet based on the original construction drawings, being built by Ken Fern in parallel with the restoration of &quot;Black Magic&quot; at Derby.

==Cultural influence==

The MacRobertson Air Race was an event of world-wide importance and did much to drive aeroplane design forward. The triumph of the Comet and its high-speed design marked a milestone in aviation.

The Comet Hotel, Hatfield was begun the year before the race, as one of the first modernist inns in England. Located close to the de Havilland factory, when it was finished it was named after the Comet Racer. War artist Eric Kennington was commissioned to create a carved column in its car park, which was erected in 1936. On its top is mounted a famous model of the Comet, currently in the livery of &quot;Grosvenor House&quot;.

Full-scale but non-flying replicas of &quot;Grosvenor House&quot; and &quot;Black Magic&quot; were constructed for the 1990 TV two-part Australian-produced dramatisation &quot;Half a World Away&quot;, which was also released on DVD as &quot;The Great Air Race&quot;. The G-ACSS replica was taxi-able and has since been restored in the livery of G-ACSR and is on static display at the De Havilland Aircraft Museum, Salisbury Hall, UK.

Comets have also appeared in fiction, see Aircraft in fiction#de Havilland DH.88 Comet.

<text>The Country of Carnival (Portuguese: O País do Carnaval) is a 1931 novel by Brazilian writer Jorge Amado. In this debut novel, the themes that would come to permeate the author&#x27;s work can already be seen, albeit in an embryonic form. The book is an account of the typical Brazilian intelligentsia of the 1920s. It has not been translated into English.

==Background==
&quot;The Country of Carnival&quot; was Jorge Amado’s first novel, written when he was only 18 at a time when he had enrolled at the law faculty in Rio de Janeiro. The first edition was published in a print run of a thousand copies. It was enthusiastically received by, among others, Rachel de Queiroz. The two met and it was she who introduced him to the Communist Youth. Whilst in Salvador, Bahia during 1927-31, Amado had been a member of the Academia dos Rebeldes (Academy of Rebels), a literary group formed around the journalist and poet Pinheiro Viegas, who Amado credited with having a significant influence on &quot;The Country of Carnival&quot;. Considered subversive, &quot;The Country of Carnival&quot; was one of the books of Amado and others that were burned in a public square in Salvador by order of the Vargas Era regime in 1937.

==Plot==
Son of a wealthy cocoa planter, Paulo Rigger, a Brazilian intellectual who has studied in Europe for seven years, wants to participate in the political and intellectual life of the country. He joins a group of intellectuals in Salvador to discuss matters of love, politics, religion and philosophy. Doubts as to the directions the nation is taking are foremost in the minds of the intellectuals. Rigger criticizes the racial miscegenation of the country and particularly the institution of Carnival, which he blames for the country&#x27;s lagging development, believing that Carnival keeps people alienated. Its excesses are cause for shock, even if his contact with the people during the street festivities makes him again feel genuinely Brazilian. Confused by these contradictions, Rigger decides to return to Europe.

<text>Cacau (trans. &quot;Cocoa&quot;) is a Brazilian social realism novel written by Jorge Amado.

It was written by Jorge Amado in 1933 and was his second novel, forming together with &quot;Suor&quot; the beginning of the development of Amado&#x27;s project of a Proletarian novel, that would communicate the basics of communist thought.

It was published in 1933 by the Ariel Publishing House in Rio de Janeiro.

== Background ==

The book had considerable autobiographical elements. Amado, twenty-one years old at the time of writing, had in his earlier life considerable direct contact with the hard life of the laborers in the cocoa plantations, and his experience formed the basis for this novel. Unlike in his first novel, the present one is written in the first person.

Reflecting the author&#x27;s political development, the book expresses Socialist ideas and promotes workers&#x27; organizing for class struggle - specifically, in the harsh and exploitive world of the cocoa plantations. &quot;Cacau&quot; ends with the hero renouncing the opportunity to marry the landowner’s daughter and, instead, setting off to join the class struggle in Rio de Janeiro.

== Plot ==

The book tells the story of a Sergipano (inhabitant of Sergipe), who arrives in Ilhéus in search of work. He suffers long hunger and is apprehensive of the city until encountering a good-hearted guard named Roberto in front of a big bakery, who gives him some bread. Later on the same day he encounters Roberto again, gets invited to a canteen to eat a feijoada and there meets several men sitting at the back. He is presented to one of them, nicknamed &quot;The &#x27;98&quot;, who in turn introduces the protagonist to a Colonel Misael, involved in recruiting men to work on the cocoa plantations. With the money that these two new friends give him, the young man manages to catch the train to Pirangi and, after a long journey and numerous events described in detail, he arrives at his destination. There, he embarks on the course of hard work and befriends the carpenter Colodino, as well as fellow workers João Grilo, Antonio Barriguinha and Honório, who are mostly Blacks or Mulattos.

But there is not only work. On days of rest the protagonist and his friends drink a lot, especially cachaça, frequent the brothels, working men&#x27;s club, and gambling dens. Many of the characters would also play an important roles in later works of Amado. Ultimately, they develop an increasing class consciousness and start becoming politically involved. This, again, is a highly autobiographical element paralleling Amado&#x27;s own life.

==Reception==
The first edition of 2,000 copies sold out in 40 days.

It was published the same year as &quot;Serafim Ponte Grande&quot; by Oswald de Andrade. Due to the fashion of the &quot;proletarian novel&quot; both &quot;Cacau&quot; by Jorge Amado and &quot;Os Corumbas&quot; by Amando Fontes were bestsellers that year. Pagu&#x27;s &quot;Parque Industrial&quot;, published also in 1933, did not share the same luck.

Alberto Passos Guimarães was the book&#x27;s first published critic: an avowed communist, his judgement of value was based on how much the novel was a proper &quot;Proletarian novel&quot;, and in his judgement it largely does.

<text>Sweat (Portuguese: Suor) is a Brazilian Modernist novel. It was written by Jorge Amado in 1934. It has yet to be translated into English.

==Background==
&quot;Sweat&quot;, Jorge Amado&#x27;s third novel, was written in Rio de Janeiro in 1934, when he was 22 and an active communist supporter. The next year, the book was translated into Russian and published in Moscow, along with &quot;Cacau&quot;, his second work. &quot;Sweat&quot; is directly linked to the author&#x27;s personal experience. In 1928, at just sixteen, he took a small room in the Pelourinho (in Salvador, Bahia), where he could witness the daily lives of the men and women forced to live in cramped conditions. 
In a Postface to his book, &quot;Captains of the Sands&quot;, Amado wrote that &quot;Sweat&quot; was the third work in the six-novel cycle he called &quot;The Bahian Novels&quot; in which he had tried to set down the &quot;life, the customs, the language of my State&quot;. He described &quot;Sweat&quot; as exposing &quot;the most failed aspect of the State, creatures who have already lost everything and expect nothing more from life&quot;. Amado writes that he had the action take place &quot;in one of those strange tenements on the Ladeiro do Pelourinho&quot; in Salvador and he did it with an aim, not only because he had met most of the characters in one of those tenements, where he had himself lived, but as much because it seemed to him that only in that environment could the novel take on a tone of revolt in the face of their anguish and misery. In Amado&#x27;s own words, &quot;Sweat&quot; and &quot;Cacau&quot; together form the portfolio of an “apprentice novelist”. The novel features concerns that would be returned to in his later works.

==The book==
The novel is a portrait of the daily misery of urban life in Salvador. The title, &quot;Sweat,&quot; indicates both the novel&#x27;s aim and its earthy style. 600 people live in the building on the Pelourinho, including workers, washerwomen, prostitutes, and anarchists. Their stories follow each other but the main character is the tenement itself. The rooms are divided and subdivided and even the patio is rented out. The only empty spaces are the stairs, which the residents use as a toilet and where rubbish piles up. Amado uses a documentary or modernist style to portray the exploitation of the working poor. His use of pieces of descriptive detail gives earthy images of their squalid living conditions but there are also early signs of the romanticism to be found in his later works.

<doc id="622830" wikidata="Q2290668" url="?curid=622830" title="Jubiabá">
<text>Jubiabá () is a Brazilian modernist novel written by Jorge Amado in 1935. It earned Amado an international reputation, being hailed by Albert Camus as “a magnificent and haunting” book.

Begun in 1934 in Conceição da Feira in Bahia, when Jorge Amado was 22, &quot;Jubiabá&quot; was completed in Rio de Janeiro the following year. Some of the characters of his later works make their first appearance here, such as the sailors Guma and Master Manuel, from &quot;Sea of Death&quot;, while &quot;Tent of Miracles&quot; published in 1969, reworked various themes from &quot;Jubiabá&quot;.

==Plot==
The novel tells the story of the friendship between a poor black youngster from Salvador de Bahia, Antonio Balduino, and a candomblé priest - Pai de Santo -, Jubiabá. After the death of his insane aunt when he was a boy, Balduino is sent to work in a rich white family. However, he has to escape when he is unjustly accused of violence towards Lindinalva, the beautiful daughter of his hosts. Balduino thenceforth spends the rest of his youth in freedom as a member of a gang of street kids, which anticipates Amado&#x27;s later novel Captains of the Sands. Subsequently, he becomes a successful boxer but, depressed after his first defeat, he leaves Salvador and starts to work on a tobacco plantation, only to be forced to flee again when he almost murders a fellow worker. On his return to Salvador, he surprisingly meets Lindinalva, who, following the bankruptcy of her father, is now a prostitute. On her death bed she entrusts her son to him. Balduino is then employed as a port worker. His involvement in a general strike causes conflict with his old friend Jubiabá, who he considers insufficiently supportive of the strike.

==Themes==
&quot;Jubiabá&quot; examines the African-Brazilian culture of the state of Bahia, with much emphasis on candomblé and macumba. It continues the theme of development of political consciousness among the working class from Amado&#x27;s earlier novels &quot;Cacau&quot; and &quot;Sweat&quot;. As with these, however, the political tension tends to be diluted by the sentimental way in which the poor are described.

==Legacy==
&quot;Jubiabá&quot; was the basis for the 1986 motion picture of the same name, &quot;Jubiabá&quot;, written and directed by Nelson Pereira dos Santos. In addition to the film, it was made into a radio soap opera in the 1940s, and there were various theatre adaptations in the 1960s and 1970s. The story also appeared in comic book format.

<doc id="622831" wikidata="Q154774" url="?curid=622831" title="Sea of Death">
<text>Sea of Death (Portuguese: Mar Morto) is a Brazilian Modernist novel written by Jorge Amado. Amado wrote the novel in response to his first arrest for &quot;being a communist&quot;. The novel follows the lives of poor sailors around Bahia, and their relationship with the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé, especially the sea goddess Iemanjá. The novel&#x27;s style and themes include many traits that characterize Amado&#x27;s later work.

==Development and style==
&quot;Sea of Death&quot; was written in 1936, the year that Jorge Amado was jailed for the first time, at the age of twenty-four, on charges of being a communist. He was arrested in Rio de Janeiro and spent two months in prison. On his release, he was invited by a British publisher, José Olympio, to produce a new novel. &quot;Sea of Death&quot; was begun in Salvador, Bahia, and completed in Rio de Janeiro. The novel won the Graça Aranha award from the Brazilian Academy of Letters in the same year.

&quot;Sea of Death&quot; was Jorge Amado’s fifth novel and the fifth of six novels he called his &quot;Bahian Novels&quot;. He described &quot;Sea of Death&quot; as a &quot;new vision of the life of the sailors of small sailing vessels on the waterfront of the state capital and the bay&quot;. It is one of his most poetically charged books. His translator, Gregory Rabassa, describes it as &quot;sentimental, &#x27;touching&#x27; and poetic&quot;. According to the critic Fábio Lucas, the novel’s poetic prose was to become a hallmark of the author’s work.

==Plot==
&quot;Sea of Death&quot; tells stories of the dockside of Salvador, Bahia. The lives of the sailors of sloops in the bay from which Bahia gets its name are centred on the mythology surrounding the goddess Iemanjá, the &quot;Queen of the Ocean&quot; or the &quot;Mother of Waters&quot;, are central to this novel, which portrays their daily struggle for survival. The novel features a variety of characters whose lives unfold around the story of two lovers, Guma and Lívia. They include the black Rufino and his mulatto lover Esmeralda; Francisco, Guma’s uncle, who mends nets; and the foul-mouthed Rosa Palmeirão.

<text>Karoline &quot;Lina&quot; Radke-Batschauer (18 October 1903 – 14 February 1983) was a German track and field athlete. She was the first Olympic champion in the 800m for women.

Born as Lina Batschauer, she started competing in athletics at the age of 20. In those years sports such as running were considered far too exhausting for women. This vision was shared by many, including the originator of the modern Olympic movement, Pierre de Coubertin.

In 1927, she married Georg Radke, who was her coach and a manager of her club &quot;SC Baden-Baden&quot;. The couple moved to Georg&#x27;s hometown of Breslau (now Wrocław in Poland), where in 1927 she set her first 800 m world record. Together with her husband, Lina Radke was one of the pioneers of female athletics in the mid-1920s. Competitions for women were not held frequently, but Radke nevertheless won several regional and national titles. She first specialised in the 1000 m, but when this was changed into the 800 m (because that distance would be held at the upcoming 1928 Summer Olympics), she switched to that event. The highlight of Radke&#x27;s career were those 1928 Summer Olympics, as she won the inaugural title in the 800 m, earning the first German gold medal in athletics. Along the way, she set the first officially recognised world record in that event, 2:16.8, which would last until 1944. Following false media reports of competitors collapsing after the race, however, the IOC banished the women&#x27;s 800 m from the Games; it would not be included again until 1960.

In 1930 Radke set a 1,000 m world record. She retired in 1934, after finishing fourth in the 800 m at the last Women&#x27;s World Games. After that she worked as athletics coach in Breslau and Torgau. Her husband took part in World War II and was held as a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union. Upon his release in 1950, the family moved to Karlsruhe.

<doc id="622835" wikidata="Q5586314" url="?curid=622835" title="Harry Bridges">
<text>Harry Bridges (28 July 1901 – 30 March 1990) was an Australian-born American union leader, first with the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association (ILA). In 1937, he led several chapters in forming a new union, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), expanding members to workers in warehouses, and led it for the next 40 years. He was prosecuted for his labor organizing and designated as subversive by the U.S. government during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, with the goal of deportation. This was never achieved.

Bridges became a naturalized citizen in 1945. His conviction by a federal jury for having lied about his Communist Party membership when seeking naturalization was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1953 as having been prosecuted untimely, outside the statute of limitations. His official power was reduced when the ILWU was expelled by the CIO in 1950, but he continued to be re-elected by the membership and was highly influential until his retirement in 1977.

==Background==
Bridges was born Alfred Renton Bryant Bridges in Kensington, Victoria, Australia. His father, Alfred Earnest Bridges, was a successful suburban realtor, and his mother, Julia ( Dorgan) Bridges, was a devout Roman Catholic of Irish descent.

==Career==

Bridges went to sea at age 16 as a merchant seaman and joined the Australian sailors&#x27; union. Inspired by Jack London to take to the sea, he took the name Harry from an uncle, who was a socialist and an adventurer. Bridges entered the United States in 1920, where his American colleagues gave him several nicknames, including &quot;The Beak&quot; for his prominent nose, &quot;The Limey,&quot; as they couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between an Australian and an Englishman, &quot;Australian Harry,&quot; and &quot;Racehorse Harry&quot; for his love of horse racing.

In 1921, Bridges joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), participating in an unsuccessful nationwide seamen&#x27;s strike. While Bridges left the IWW shortly thereafter with doubts about the organization, his early experiences in the IWW and in Australian unions influenced his beliefs on militant unionism, based on rank and file power and involvement.

Bridges left the sea for longshore work in San Francisco in 1922. The shipowners had created a company union after the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association local in San Francisco was destroyed by a strike it lost in 1919. Bridges resisted joining that union, finding casual work on the docks as a &quot;pirate&quot;. After he joined the San Francisco local of the ILA and participated in a Labor Day parade in 1924, he was blacklisted for several years. Bridges eventually joined the company union in 1927 and worked as a winch operator and rigger on a steel-handling gang.

===Albion Hall group===
The ILA renewed its efforts to reestablish itself on the West Coast, chartering a new local in San Francisco in 1933. With the passage that year of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which contained some encouraging but unenforceable provisions declaring that workers had the right to organize unions of their own choice, thousands of longshoremen joined the new ILA local.

At the time Bridges was a member of a circle of longshoremen that came to be known as the &quot;Albion Hall Group&quot;, after their meeting place. It attracted members from a variety of backgrounds: members of the Communist Party, which was then trying to organize all longshoremen, sailors and other maritime workers into the Marine Workers Industrial Union (MWIU), as a revolutionary, industry-wide alternative to the ILA and other American Federation of Labor (AFL) unions; former IWW members, and others with no clearly defined politics.

This group had acquired some influence on the docks through its publication &quot;The Waterfront Worker&quot;, a mimeographed sheet sold for a penny that published articles written by longshoremen and seamen, almost always under pseudonyms. These articles focused on workers&#x27; day-to-day concerns: the pace of work, the weight of loads, abusive bosses, and unsafe working conditions. While the first editions were published in the apartment of an MWIU member on a second-hand mimeograph machine, the paper remained independent of both the party and the MWIU.

Although Bridges was sympathetic to much of the MWIU&#x27;s program in 1933, he chose to join the new ILA local. When the local held elections, Bridges and fellow members of the Albion Hall group made up a majority of the executive board and held two of the three business agents positions.

The Albion Hall Group stressed the self-help tactics of syndicalism, urging workers to organize by taking part in strikes and slowdowns, rather than depending on governmental assistance under the NIRA. It also campaigned for membership participation in the new ILA local, which had not bothered to hold any membership meetings. Finally, the group started laying the groundwork for organizing on a coastwide basis, meeting with activists from Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington and organizing a federation of all of the different unions that represented maritime workers.

Under Bridges&#x27; leadership, the group organized a successful 5-day strike in October 1933 to force Matson Navigation Company to reinstate four longshoremen it had fired for wearing ILA buttons on the job. Longshoremen at other ports threatened to refuse to handle Matson cargo unless the company rehired the four men.

===1934 West Coast Longshore Strike===

Early in 1934, Bridges and the Albion Hall group and militants in other ports began planning a coast-wide strike. The Roosevelt administration tried to head off the strike by appointing a mediation board to oversee negotiations, but neither side accepted its proposed compromise. Bridges was elected chairman of the strike committee. The strike began on 9 May. While the elected local officers were the nominal leaders of the strike at its outset, Bridges led the planning of the strike along with his friend Sam Kagel. They recruited rank-and-file opposition to the two proposed contracts that the leadership negotiated and the membership rejected during the strike, and the dealings with other unions during related events.

A four-day San Francisco General strike took place after &quot;Bloody Thursday&quot; on 5 July, when police aided the Waterfront Employers Association in trucking cargo from the pierheads to the warehouses through the union&#x27;s picket line. Scores of strikers were beaten or wounded by gunfire during the battle. During a coordinated raid on the union mess hall at the corner of Steuart and Mission, San Francisco Police shot and killed Howard Sperry, a striking sailor, and Nick Counderakis (AKA Nick Bordoise), a member of the cooks&#x27; union and a strike sympathizer helping out at the mess hall. Scores of other men were wounded by police gunfire as well, including a number of bystanders, as the ensuing battle quickly spilled into the nearby downtown area.

Bridges became the chief spokesperson for the union in negotiations after workers rejected the second agreement negotiated by the old leadership in June. Bridges did not control the strike: over his strong objections, the ILA membership voted to accept arbitration to end the strike. Similarly, in 1935, Bridges&#x27; opposition did not stop the ILA leadership from extending the union&#x27;s contract with the employers, rather than striking in solidarity with the seamen.

===Growth and independence===
Bridges was elected president of the San Francisco local in 1934 and president of the Pacific Coast District of the ILA in 1936. During this period the ILA commenced &quot;the March Inland&quot;, in which it organized the many warehouses, both in the ports and those at a distance from them, which received the goods that longshoremen handled. Bridges led efforts to form Maritime Federation of the Pacific, which brought all of the maritime unions together for common action. That federation helped the sailors union win the same sort of contract after a long strike in 1936 that the ILA had achieved in 1934.

In 1937, the Pacific Coast district, with the exception of three locals in the Northwest, formally seceded from the ILA, renaming itself as the International Longshoremen&#x27;s and Warehousemen&#x27;s Union, after the ILA tried to reorganize the existing locals, abandon representation of warehousemen, and reverse the unions&#x27; policies on issues such as unemployment insurance.

Bridges was elected president of the new union, which quickly affiliated with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Bridges became the West Coast Director for the CIO shortly thereafter.

The ILWU also established strong unions on the docks in Hawai&#x27;i during this time, and later among sugar and pineapple workers there. It encountered the concerted opposition of the employers, the military and most of the political establishment but the ILWU&#x27;s work changed the political climate in Hawai&#x27;i. It broke the hold on power that the white landed elite had exercised for half a century.

As a measure of his influence, Bridges was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on 19 July 1937.

===Legal battles===

In mid-July 1939, hearings took place at the Angel Island Immigration Station to deport Bridges. Government witnesses included Major Lawrence Milner and ex-communist official John Lewis Leech. While Leech held fast to his testimony, Milner confessed to perjury, for which the Bridges defense team demanded indictment, although there is no evidence Milner was ever indicted.

The hearings found Bridges did not qualify for deportation because he was not &quot;currently&quot; — as the Alien Act of 1918 required — a member of or affiliated with an organization that advocated the overthrow of the government. The Smith Act of 1940 was written so federal authorities could deport Bridges. It allowed deportation of an alien who was a member or affiliated &quot;at any time&quot; since arriving in the U.S. with such an organization advocating overthrow of the government. A second round of deportation hearings ended after ten weeks in June 1941. In September 1941, the special examiner who led the hearings recommended deportation, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) reversed that order after finding the government&#x27;s two key witnesses to be unreliable.

In May 1942, though the Roosevelt administration was now putting its anti-Communist activities on hold in the interest of furthering the Soviet-American alliance, Attorney General Biddle overruled the BIA and ordered Bridges deportation. Bridges appealed and lost in District Court and the Court of Appeals. But the United States Supreme Court overruled deportation, holding 5–3 on June 18, 1945, in the case of &quot;Bridges v. Wixon,&quot; that the government had not proven Bridges was &quot;affiliated&quot; with the CPUSA, a word it interpreted to require more than &quot;sympathy&quot; or &quot;mere cooperation&quot;.
Bridges became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1945. With the goal of deportation, in 1948 the federal government tried Bridges for fraud and perjury, for denying when applying for naturalization that he had ever been a member of the Communist Party. The jury convicted Bridges and two co-defendants. He was sentenced to five years in prison and his citizenship was revoked. The Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision overturned the conviction in 1953 because the indictment on fraud and perjury charges did not occur within the three years set by the statute of limitations. The government dropped the criminal charges and pursued a case in civil court in June and July 1955, hoping to overturn Bridges&#x27; naturalization because it had been obtained by fraud. The trial judge ruled in Bridges&#x27; favor and the government did not appeal.

===Political battles===

Bridges hewed to the Communist Party line throughout the late 1930s and 1940s. After the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact was signed in 1939, the party attacked Roosevelt and Churchill as warmongers and adopted the slogan &quot;The Yanks Ain&#x27;t Coming.&quot; Bridges denounced President Roosevelt for betraying labor and preparing for war. John L. Lewis, the head of the CIO, responded in October 1939 by abolishing the position of West Coast director of the CIO, limiting Bridges&#x27; authority to California.

Bridges continued opposing the Roosevelt Administration, belittling the New Deal and urging union voters to withhold their support from Roosevelt. He said they should wait to see what Lewis, who had now also split with the Roosevelt administration, recommended. That position proved highly unpopular with the membership; many locals had already endorsed FDR for a third term and several locals passed motions calling for Bridges to resign. He refused, noting that the union&#x27;s constitution allowed for a recall election if fifteen percent of the membership petitioned for one. The ILWU executive board gave him a vote of confidence.

After Germany attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, Bridges urged employers to increase productivity in order to prepare for war. When the CIO later adopted a wartime no-strike pledge, Bridges supported the pledge. He proposed at the high point of the Communist Party&#x27;s enthusiasm for unity—immediately after the Teheran Conference in 1943—that the pledge continue after the end of the war. The ILWU not only condemned the Retail, Wholesale Department Store Employees union for striking Montgomery Ward in 1943—after management refused to sign a new contract, cut wages, and fired union activists—but also assisted it in breaking the strike, by ordering members in St. Paul, Minnesota to work overtime, to handle overflow from the struck Chicago plant.

Bridges also called for a speedup of the pace of work—which may not have been inconsistent with the ILWU&#x27;s goal of controlling the way that work was done on the docks. It had struggled with employers on this issue and the speedup was rejected by many ILWU members. Bridges later joined with Joseph Curran of the National Maritime Union, which represented sailors on the East Coast, and Julius Emspak of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, to support a proposal by Roosevelt in 1944, to militarize some civilian workplaces.

Bridges&#x27; attitude changed sharply after the end of World War II. While he still advocated the post-war plan for industrial peace that the Communist Party, along with the leaders of the CIO, the AFL and the Chamber of Commerce, were advocating, he differed sharply with CIO leadership on Cold War politics. He had his own opinions about the Marshall Plan and the application of the Truman Doctrine in Greece and Turkey, as well as participation in the World Federation of Trade Unions, viewing every element from the point of how it would affect his constituents.

Those foreign policy issues became labor issues for the ILWU in 1948, when the employers claimed that the union was preparing to strike in order to cripple the Marshall Plan. Emboldened by the new provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act, which required union officers to sign an oath that they were not members of the Communist Party, outlawed the closed shop, and gave the President authority to seek an 80-day &quot;cooling off&quot; period before a strike that would imperil the national health or safety, the employers pushed for a strike. They hoped to rid themselves of Bridges and reclaim control over the hiring hall. As it turned out, their strategy was a failure. The employer group reached a new agreement with the union after replacing their bargaining representatives and enduring a ninety-five-day strike.

At the same time, Philip Murray, Lewis&#x27; successor as head of the CIO, had started reducing Bridges&#x27; power within the CIO, removing him from his position as the CIO&#x27;s California Regional Director in 1948. In 1950, after an internal trial, the CIO expelled the ILWU due to its communist leadership.

===Coping with change===

Expulsion had no real effect, however, on either the ILWU or Bridges&#x27; power within it. The organization continued to negotiate agreements, with less strife than in the 1930s and 1940s, and Bridges continued to be reelected without serious opposition. The union negotiated a groundbreaking agreement in 1960, that permitted the extensive mechanization of the docks. Its leadership agreed to significantly reducing the number of longshore workers in return for generous job guarantees and benefits for those displaced by the changes.

The agreement, however, highlighted the lesser status of less senior members, known as &quot;B-men.&quot; Bridges reacted defensively to these workers&#x27; complaints, which had additional sting because many of the &quot;B-men&quot; were black and had worked hard to enter the union. The additional longshore work produced by the Vietnam War allowed Bridges to meet the challenge by opening up more jobs and making determined efforts to recruit black applicants. The ILWU later faced similar challenges from women, who found it even harder to enter the industry and the union.

Bridges had difficulty giving up his position in the ILWU. He explored the possibility of merging it with the ILA or the Teamsters in the early 1970s. He retired in 1977 after ensuring that Louis Goldblatt, the long-time Secretary-Treasurer of the union and his logical successor, was denied the opportunity to replace him. He opposed Goldblatt.

On 28 July 2001, on what would have been Bridges&#x27; 100th birthday, the ILWU organized a week-long event celebrating the life of the union leader. This culminated in a march of more than 8000 unionists and supporters across the Vincent Thomas Bridge from Terminal Island to San Pedro, California. The longshoremen shut down the port for eight hours in honor of Bridges.

==Personal life and death==

Harry Bridges began a relationship with Agnes Bridges (née Brown) at age 21 in Marshfield (Coos Bay), Oregon, in 1922. They had a child and lived as an unmarried couple for twelve years, and they formally married in 1934 shortly before the West Coast Waterfront Strike began. Their relationship deteriorated as Harry became a more prominent leader in the union, and they divorced in 1945. In a series of nasty and highly publicized divorce hearings, both accused each other of physical violence, Harry accused Agnes of alcoholism, and Agnes accused Harry of fathering a child with Nancy Berdecio. Agnes was later paid by the FBI to testify against Harry in his deportation trials.

In the mid-1930&#x27;s, Bridges was rumored to have had an affair with his secretary, Norma Perry, who later worked for and had a relationship with Harry Lundeberg. Some speculation suggests that Norma Perry was an underlying reason for Bridges&#x27; split with Lundeberg during the 1936-37 Pacific Coast Maritime Strike.

In 1940, Bridges met Nancy Fenton Berdecio Bridges, a onetime professional dancer, while traveling in New York City. In 1943, Berdecio became pregnant with a child fathered by Bridges, though he denied paternity in his divorce hearing with Agnes. After finalizing his divorce, Harry and Nancy married in 1946. They divorced after eight years of marriage. They had one additional child.

Bridges met Noriko &quot;Nikki&quot; Sawada in San Francisco, when introduced by her employer, Charles Garry, a civil rights lawyer. They were attending a fund-raiser for mine, mill, and smelter workers. The two later became a couple. In 1958, the couple decided to marry in Reno, Nevada. At the county courthouse, the clerk refused the couple a marriage license because Sawada was ethnic Japanese and Nevada had an 1846 statute banning marriage between any white person and &quot;any person of the Ethiopian or black race, Malay or brown race, Mongolian or yellow race, or American Indian, or red race.&quot; Bridges and Sawada asked the Federal District Court to order the marriage license be issued. Judge Taylor Wines granted the order and the couple married 10 December 1958. This order prompted the Nevada legislature to repeal the state&#x27;s anti-miscegenation laws on 17 March 1959.

Harry Bridges died aged 88 on 30 March 1990.

==Legacy==

The ILWU headquarters in San Francisco is called the Harry R. Bridges Memorial Building.

On the West Coast, Bridges still excites passions both for and against the labor movement.

The Harry Bridges Institute in San Pedro, California, is a research institute that focuses on topics of international economics and how changes in political geography affect unions. The archives of the Harry Bridges Institute are held in the University Library at California State University, Northridge. The Harry Bridges Center for Labor Studies at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle, Washington, was established in Bridges&#x27; honor in 1992 by ILWU past and current ILWU members. The center supports research, teaching, and community outreach by UW faculty and students and labor organizations.

Harry Bridges Span School, in the harbor town of Wilmington, California, is named after him, as is Harry Bridges Blvd (also in Wilmington), which runs along the north side of the Port of Los Angeles.

In 1941, The Almanac Singers, including Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger, recorded &quot;Song for Bridges&quot; while working on their album &quot;Talking Union&quot; that defends Bridges&#x27; work. In 1994, Rancid, a band from Oakland, California, released a song titled &quot;Harry Bridges&quot; on their album &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot; following their song &quot;Union Blood&quot; on their 1993 &quot;Rancid&quot;.

California Governor Gray Davis declared 28 July 2001, Bridges&#x27; 100th birthday, as &quot;Harry Bridges Day.&quot; On the same day, the City of San Francisco dedicated a plaza near the San Francisco Ferry Building in Bridges&#x27; honor.

In 2009, the nonprofit Harry Bridges Project produced &quot;From Wharf Rats to Lords of the Docks: The Life and Times of Harry Bridges&quot;, a one-man play that was directed and filmed by Haskell Wexler. It promotes Bridges&#x27; legacy and the influence of his work. The film was broadcast on some PBS stations on Labor Day Weekend in 2009.

In 2010, the Long Beach City Council renamed the Queen Mary Events Park to the Harry Bridges Memorial Park.

In a 2023 biography of Bridges, professor emeritus Robert W. Cherny concluded that Bridges had not been a CPUSA member based on careful checks against multiple contemporary sources, however much Bridges agreed with various aspects of Marxism or extolled the USSR. Instead, he found that Bridges was one of a few people &quot;listened to, consulted with, offered advice, and asked for advice, but were not given directions and were not under party discipline&quot;.

<text>Myosotis ( ) is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. The name comes from the Ancient Greek &quot;mouse&#x27;s ear&quot;, which the foliage is thought to resemble. In the Northern Hemisphere, they are colloquially known as forget-me-nots or scorpion grasses. &quot;Myosotis alpestris&quot; is the official flower of Alaska and Dalsland, Sweden. Plants of the genus are not to be confused with Chatham Islands&#x27; forget-me-nots, which belong to the related genus &quot;Myosotidium&quot;.

==Description==
The genus was originally described by Carl Linnaeus. The type species is &quot;Myosotis scorpioides&quot;. &quot;Myosotis&quot; species are annual or perennial, herbaceous, flowering plants with pentamerous actinomorphic flowers with five sepals and petals. Flowers are typically 1 cm (½&quot;) in diameter or less, flatly faced, coloured typically blue, but sometimes pink, white or yellow with yellow centres and borne on scorpioid cymes. Their foliage is alternate, and their roots are generally diffuse. They typically flower in spring or soon after the melting of snow in alpine ecosystems. 
The seeds are contained in small, tulip-shaped pods along the stem to the flower. The pods attach to clothing when brushed against and eventually fall off, leaving the small seed within the pod to germinate elsewhere. Seeds can be collected by placing a sheet of paper under stems and shaking the seed pods onto the paper.

&quot;Myosotis scorpioides&quot; is colloquially called scorpion grass because of the spiraling curvature of its inflorescence.

==Distribution==
The genus is largely restricted to western Eurasia, with over 60 confirmed species, and New Zealand with around 40 endemic species. A few species occur elsewhere, including North America, South America, and Papua New Guinea. Despite this, &quot;Myosotis&quot; species are now common throughout temperate latitudes because of the introduction of cultivars and alien species. Many are popular in horticulture. They prefer moist habitats. In locales where they are not native, they frequently escape to wetlands and riverbanks. 

One or two European species, especially &quot;Myosotis sylvatica&quot;, the &quot;woodland&quot; forget-me-not, have been introduced into most of the temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and the Americas.

Genetic analysis indicates that the genus originated in the Northern Hemisphere, and that species native to New Zealand, Australia, New Guinea, and South America form a lineage of closely related species that are likely derived from a single dispersal event to the Southern Hemisphere.

==Ecology==
&quot;Myosotis&quot; species are food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, including the setaceous Hebrew character. Many of the species in New Zealand are threatened.

==Symbolism==
The small, blue forget-me-not flower was first used by the Grand Lodge &quot;Zur Sonne&quot;, in 1926, as a Masonic emblem at the annual convention in Bremen, Germany. In 1938, a forget-me-not badge—made by the same factory as the Masonic badge—was chosen for the annual Nazi Party &quot;Winterhilfswerk&quot;, the annual charity drive of the National Socialist People&#x27;s Welfare, the welfare branch of the Nazi party. This coincidence enabled Freemasons to wear the forget-me-not badge as a secret sign of membership.

After World War II, the forget-me-not flower was used again as a Masonic emblem in 1948 at the first Annual Convention of the United Grand Lodges of Germany. The badge is now worn in the coat lapel by Freemasons around the world to remember all who suffered in the name of Freemasonry, especially those during the Nazi era.

The flower is also used as a symbol of remembrance by the people of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is used to commemorate those from the province who were killed in the First World War, and worn around July 1.

It is also used in Germany to commemorate the fallen soldiers of the world wars in a similar manner to the use of remembrance poppies in the UK.

The flower is also the symbol for the Armenian genocide&#x27;s 100th anniversary. The design of the flower is a black dot symbolising the past, and the suffering of Armenian people. The light purple appendages symbolise the present, and unity of Armenians. The five purple petals symbolise the future, and the five continents to which Armenians escaped. The yellow in the centre symbolises eternity, and the Tsitsernakaberd itself symbolises the 12 provinces lost to Turkey.

In Lithuania, the flower has become one of the symbols for the commemoration of the January events of 1991.

In the Netherlands, the forget-me-not has become a symbol for Alzheimer Nederland, a foundation advocating for people suffering from dementia.

In New Zealand, the forget-me-not is the symbol for Alzheimers New Zealand, the foundation advocating for people suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia.

In the United Kingdom, many health settings make use of the forget-me-not as a symbol to highlight that someone has dementia; it may be placed on notes, bedsides or patient boards. Also in the United Kingdom, the forget-me-not is the symbol of the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society.

In the history of art, the forget-me-not is used to remember loved ones who have died, and so is very common in funerary portraits.

Since the Medieval period it has become a symbol of everlasting love and devotion. There is a German legend set as an origin story behind the name &quot;Forget-Me-Not&quot;. In the legend, a knight was walking with his lady near the Danube River and decided to pick blue flowers for her. While picking the flowers he fell in the river and was swept away. He tossed the flowers to his lady and his last words to her were &quot;Forget-me-not!&quot;.

<text>Hannah (; &quot;Ḥannā&quot; &quot;favor, grace&quot;) is one of the wives of Elkanah mentioned in the First Book of Samuel. According to the Hebrew Bible she was the mother of Samuel.

==Biblical narrative==
The narrative about Hannah can be found in . Outside of the first two chapters of 1 Samuel, she is not otherwise mentioned in the Bible.

In the biblical narrative, Hannah is one of two wives of Elkanah. The other, Peninnah, had given birth to Elkanah&#x27;s children, but Hannah remained childless. Nevertheless, Elkanah preferred Hannah. According to Lillian Klein, the use of this chiasmus underscores the standing of the women: Hannah is the primary wife, yet Peninnah has succeeded in bearing children. Hannah&#x27;s status as primary wife and her barrenness recall Sarah and Rebecca in Genesis 17 and Genesis 25 respectively. Klein suggests that Elkanah took Peninnah as a second wife because of Hannah&#x27;s barrenness.

Every year, Elkanah would offer a sacrifice at the Shiloh sanctuary, and give Peninnah and her children a portion but he gave Hannah a double portion &quot;because he loved her, and the LORD had closed her womb&quot; (1 Samuel 1:5, NIV). One day Hannah went up to the Tabernacle and prayed with great weeping (I Samuel 1:10), while Eli the High Priest was sitting on a chair near the doorpost. In her prayer, she asked God for a son and in return she vowed to give the son back to God for the service of God. She promised he would remain a Nazarite all the days of his life. According to Lillian Klein, the value of women is demonstrably enhanced by their child-bearing capacities. The narrative takes her pain and places it in her personal failure and then draws it out in a communal context. The desperation of Hannah&#x27;s vow indicates that merely bearing a male child would establish her in the community.

Eli thought she was drunk and questioned her. When she explained herself, he blessed her and sent her home. Hannah conceived and bore a son, and named him Samuel, literally &quot;Heard by God&quot;, &quot;since she had asked the Lord for him&quot; (1 Samuel 1:20 NAB). She raised him until he was weaned and brought him to the temple along with a sacrifice.

Hannah is also considered to be a prophetess: in her song of thanksgiving () she is inspired “to discern in her own individual experience the universal laws of the divine economy, and to recognise its significance for the whole course of the Kingdom of God&quot;. This song may be compared to the Magnificat, Mary&#x27;s song of thanksgiving in the New Testament (), but biblical commentator A. F. Kirkpatrick notes that &quot;the &quot;Magnificat&quot; should be carefully compared with Hannah’s song, of which it is an echo rather than an imitation. The resemblance lies in thought and tone more than in actual language, and supplies a most delicate and valuable testimony to the appropriateness of this hymn to Hannah’s circumstances&quot;.

Eli announced another blessing on Hannah, and she conceived 3 more sons and 2 daughters, making six in total.

==In contemporary biblical criticism==

Hannah&#x27;s conflict with her rival, her barrenness, and her longing for a son are stereotypical motifs. According to Michelle Osherow, Hannah represents the character of the earnest petitioner and grateful celebrant of divine glory. Hannah was an important figure for early English Protestantism, which emphasized the importance of private prayer. The Jerusalem Talmud took Hannah as an exemplar of prayer. The story of Hannah is the Haftarah reading for Rosh Hashanah.

===Samuel or Saul===
The Hebrew form of the name &quot;Saul&quot; is &quot;shaul,&quot; and the story of Samuel&#x27;s birth contains repeated uses the related verbal root &quot;sh-&#x27;-l&quot; in various forms, including in the verse in which Hannah explains her son&#x27;s name (1:20). In verse 28, the form &quot;shaul&quot; (&quot;lent&quot;) itself is found, identical to the Hebrew name of Saul. As a result, it has been suggested by critical commentators the story was originally about the birth of Saul, but that the name &quot;Samuel&quot; was substituted for Saul at a later date. Alternatively, Nadav Na&#x27;aman argues that the verbal root &quot;sh-&#x27;-l&quot; is actually related to the name &quot;Shiloh&quot;, the place where Samuel was born.

==Vows==
Numbers 30:11-13 allows a husband to nullify a vow made by his wife, if he registers his objection when he learns of it. However, if he says nothing, the vow is allowed as valid. The next time Elkanah goes to Shiloh, Hannah remains home to care for her child, but tells him that she will present the boy to the Lord when he is weaned. Elkanah responds, &quot;Do what you think best.&quot; By the time &quot;the child was weaned&quot;—there is some debate as to what age Samuel was dedicated to the Temple—Hannah serves the soundness of her promise by bringing a viable child to serve in the sanctuary, already educated in the ways of the Lord. The quality of one&#x27;s sacrifice reflected the quality of one&#x27;s faith.

In Leviticus, provisions were made for redeeming vows or pledges in money that would go to the support of the priests and the sanctuary. So Hannah could have chosen that option to fulfill her vow, if on calm reflection, once she had her son, she felt unable to part with him.

<doc id="622840" wikidata="Q7354091" url="?curid=622840" title="Rochin v. California">
<text>Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States that added behavior that &quot;shocks the conscience&quot; into tests of what violates due process clause of the 14th Amendment. This balancing test is often criticized as having subsequently been used in a particularly subjective manner.

==Background==
On July 1, 1949, three Los Angeles County deputy sheriffs entered the Rochins&#x27; residence without a search warrant and forcibly entered Rochin&#x27;s room on the second floor.

Upon entering the room, the deputies noticed two capsules on the night stand. Richard Rochin immediately swallowed the capsules after Deputy Jack Jones asked him, &quot;Whose stuff is this?&quot; Jones then grabbed and squeezed Rochin by the neck, as well as shoving his fingers in Rochin&#x27;s mouth as he attempted to eject the capsules. The deputies, unable to obtain the capsules, handcuffed and took Rochin to Angeles Emergency Hospital where he was strapped to an operating table and had a tube forcibly placed in his mouth and into his stomach and given an emetic solution, whereupon he vomited the capsules into a bucket. The deputies then retrieved the capsules and tested them to be morphine. Subsequently, this was submitted as evidence, and Rochin was found guilty of violating California Health and Safety Code § 11500 as having an unlawful possession of morphine.

Rochin appealed his case on the basis that his rights, guaranteed to him by Amendments V and XIV of the United States Constitution and by Article I(1)(13)(19) of the California Constitution rendered the evidence inadmissible, and that the forced stomach pumping was unconstitutionally compelled self-incrimination. The appeals court denied his defense arguing that the evidence was admissible, despite the egregious behavior of the officers, as it was &quot;competent evidence,&quot; and the courts are not allowed to question the means in which it was obtained. As the court wrote, &quot;illegally obtained evidence is admissible on a criminal charge in this state.&quot;

==Decision==
The court voted in an 8-0 decision (Minton abstained) to overturn the decision. Justice Frankfurter wrote the majority opinion which struck down the prior conviction, arguing that the brutality of the means used to extract the evidence from Rochin &quot;shocks the conscience,&quot; and it clearly violates the due process of law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Frankfurter also admitted the term &quot;due process&quot; was nebulous but asserted that it existed to preserve the fairness and integrity of the system and that society expects judges to act impartially and to take into account precedence and social context.

The court quoted from the decision of the California Supreme Court, in which two justices dissented, saying, 
Justice Douglas and Black both wrote concurring opinions in which they argued that the lower court&#x27;s decision should have been overturned based on the Fifth Amendment liberty from self incrimination. Both justices believed that the 14th Amendment&#x27;s guarantee of &quot;due process&quot; incorporated that right. The justices&#x27; opinions also offered much criticism of Frankfurter&#x27;s opinion for the court.

Douglas rebuked the court for suddenly declaring that the exclusion of illegally obtained evidence, which had not been an issue up until then, suddenly violated the &quot;decencies of civilized conduct.&quot; Black disagreed with the logic in the majority as being contradictory. He argued the opinion enabled the court to nullify the California state law of using illegal evidence based on due process because its application, &quot;shocks the conscience,&quot; but then admonishes judges to be impartial and use the society&#x27;s standards in judgment.

<doc id="622844" wikidata="Q1132952" url="?curid=622844" title="Homogeneous function">
<text>In mathematics, a homogeneous function is a function of several variables such that the following holds: If each of the function&#x27;s arguments is multiplied by the same scalar, then the function&#x27;s value is multiplied by some power of this scalar; the power is called the degree of homogeneity, or simply the &quot;degree&quot;. That is, if is an integer, a function of variables is homogeneous of degree if
:formula_1
for every formula_2 and formula_3 This is also referred to a &quot;th-degree&quot; or &quot;th-order&quot; homogeneous function.

For example, a homogeneous polynomial of degree defines a homogeneous function of degree .

The above definition extends to functions whose domain and codomain are vector spaces over a field : a function formula_4 between two -vector spaces is &quot;homogeneous&quot; of degree formula_5 if

for all nonzero formula_6 and formula_7 This definition is often further generalized to functions whose domain is not , but a cone in , that is, a subset of such that formula_8 implies formula_9 for every nonzero scalar .

In the case of functions of several real variables and real vector spaces, a slightly more general form of homogeneity called positive homogeneity is often considered, by requiring only that the above identities hold for formula_10 and allowing any real number as a degree of homogeneity. Every homogeneous real function is &quot;positively homogeneous&quot;. The converse is not true, but is locally true in the sense that (for integer degrees) the two kinds of homogeneity cannot be distinguished by considering the behavior of a function near a given point.

A norm over a real vector space is an example of a positively homogeneous function that is not homogeneous. A special case is the absolute value of real numbers. The quotient of two homogeneous polynomials of the same degree gives an example of a homogeneous function of degree zero. This example is fundamental in the definition of projective schemes.

== Definitions ==

The concept of a homogeneous function was originally introduced for functions of several real variables. With the definition of vector spaces at the end of 19th century, the concept has been naturally extended to functions between vector spaces, since a tuple of variable values can be considered as a coordinate vector. It is this more general point of view that is described in this article. 

There are two commonly used definitions. The general one works for vector spaces over arbitrary fields, and is restricted to degrees of homogeneity that are integers.

The second one supposes to work over the field of real numbers, or, more generally, over an ordered field. This definition restricts to positive values the scaling factor that occurs in the definition, and is therefore called &quot;positive homogeneity&quot;, the qualificative &quot;positive&quot; being often omitted when there is no risk of confusion. Positive homogeneity leads to considering more functions as homogeneous. For example, the absolute value and all norms are positively homogeneous functions that are not homogeneous.

The restriction of the scaling factor to real positive values allows also considering homogeneous functions whose degree of homogeneity is any real number.

=== General homogeneity ===
Let and be two vector spaces over a field . A linear cone in is a subset of such that
formula_11 for all formula_12 and all nonzero formula_13

A &quot;homogeneous function&quot; from to is a partial function from to that has a linear cone as its domain, and satisfies
:formula_14
for some integer , every formula_15 and every nonzero formula_13 The integer is called the &quot;degree of homogeneity&quot;, or simply the &quot;degree&quot; of .

A typical example of a homogeneous function of degree is the function defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree . The rational function defined by the quotient of two homogeneous polynomials is a homogeneous function; its degree is the difference of the degrees of the numerator and the denominator; its &quot;cone of definition&quot; is the linear cone of the points where the value of denominator is not zero.

Homogeneous functions play a fundamental role in projective geometry since any homogeneous function from to defines a well-defined function between the projectivizations of and . The homogeneous rational functions of degree zero (those defined by the quotient of two homogeneous polynomial of the same degree) play an essential role in the Proj construction of projective schemes.

=== Positive homogeneity ===
When working over the real numbers, or more generally over an ordered field, it is commonly convenient to consider &quot;positive homogeneity&quot;, the definition being exactly the same as that in the preceding section, with &quot;nonzero &quot; replaced by &quot;&quot; in the definitions of a linear cone and a homogeneous function. 

This change allow considering (positively) homogeneous functions with any real number as their degrees, since exponentiation with a positive real base is well defined.

Even in the case of integer degrees, there are many useful functions that are positively homogeneous without being homogeneous. This is, in particular, the case of the absolute value function and norms, which are all positively homogeneous of degree . They are not homogeneous since formula_17 if formula_18 This remains true in the complex case, since the field of the complex numbers formula_19 and every complex vector space can be considered as real vector spaces.

Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem is a characterization of positively homogeneous differentiable functions, which may be considered as the &quot;fundamental theorem on homogeneous functions&quot;.

==Examples==

===Simple example===
The function formula_20 is homogeneous of degree 2:
formula_21

===Absolute value and norms===
The absolute value of a real number is a positively homogeneous function of degree , which is not homogeneous, since formula_22 if formula_23 and formula_24 if formula_25

The absolute value of a complex number is a positively homogeneous function of degree formula_26 over the real numbers (that is, when considering the complex numbers as a vector space over the real numbers). It is not homogeneous, over the real numbers as well as over the complex numbers.

More generally, every norm and seminorm is a positively homogeneous function of degree which is not a homogeneous function. As for the absolute value, if the norm or semi-norm is defined on a vector space over the complex numbers, this vector space has to be considered as vector space over the real number for applying the definition of a positively homogeneous function.

===Linear Maps===
Any linear map formula_4 between vector spaces over a field is homogeneous of degree 1, by the definition of linearity:
formula_28
for all formula_29 and formula_7

Similarly, any multilinear function formula_31 is homogeneous of degree formula_32 by the definition of multilinearity:
formula_33
for all formula_29 and formula_35

===Homogeneous polynomials===

Monomials in formula_36 variables define homogeneous functions formula_37 For example,
formula_38
is homogeneous of degree 10 since
formula_39
The degree is the sum of the exponents on the variables; in this example, formula_40

A homogeneous polynomial is a polynomial made up of a sum of monomials of the same degree. For example,
formula_41
is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 5. Homogeneous polynomials also define homogeneous functions.

Given a homogeneous polynomial of degree formula_5 with real coefficients that takes only positive values, one gets a positively homogeneous function of degree formula_43 by raising it to the power formula_44 So for example, the following function is positively homogeneous of degree 1 but not homogeneous:
formula_45

===Min/max===
For every set of weights formula_46 the following functions are positively homogeneous of degree 1, but not homogeneous:
* formula_47 (Leontief utilities)
* formula_48

===Rational functions===
Rational functions formed as the ratio of two polynomials are homogeneous functions in their domain, that is, off of the linear cone formed by the zeros of the denominator. Thus, if formula_49 is homogeneous of degree formula_50 and formula_51 is homogeneous of degree formula_32 then formula_53 is homogeneous of degree formula_54 away from the zeros of formula_55

===Non-examples===
The homogeneous real functions of a single variable have the form formula_56 for some constant . So, the affine function formula_57 the natural logarithm formula_58 and the exponential function formula_59 are not homogeneous.

== Euler&#x27;s theorem ==
Roughly speaking, Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem asserts that the positively homogeneous functions of a given degree are exactly the solution of a specific partial differential equation. More precisely:

As a consequence, if formula_60 is continuously differentiable and homogeneous of degree formula_61 its first-order partial derivatives formula_62 are homogeneous of degree formula_63 
This results from Euler&#x27;s theorem by differentiating the partial differential equation with respect to one variable.

In the case of a function of a single real variable (formula_64), the theorem implies that a continuously differentiable and positively homogeneous function of degree has the form formula_65 for formula_66 and formula_67 for formula_68 The constants formula_69 and formula_70 are not necessarily the same, as it is the case for the absolute value.

==Application to differential equations==
The substitution formula_71 converts the ordinary differential equation
formula_72
where formula_73 and formula_74 are homogeneous functions of the same degree, into the separable differential equation
formula_75

==Generalizations ==
=== Homogeneity under a monoid action ===

The definitions given above are all specialized cases of the following more general notion of homogeneity in which formula_76 can be any set (rather than a vector space) and the real numbers can be replaced by the more general notion of a monoid. 

Let formula_77 be a monoid with identity element formula_78 let formula_76 and formula_80 be sets, and suppose that on both formula_76 and formula_80 there are defined monoid actions of formula_83 Let formula_5 be a non-negative integer and let formula_85 be a map. Then formula_49 is said to be if for every formula_87 and formula_88
formula_89 
If in addition there is a function formula_90 denoted by formula_91 called an then formula_49 is said to be if for every formula_87 and formula_88
formula_95

A function is (resp. ) if it is homogeneous of degree formula_26 over formula_77 (resp. absolutely homogeneous of degree formula_26 over formula_77). 

More generally, it is possible for the symbols formula_100 to be defined for formula_101 with formula_5 being something other than an integer (for example, if formula_77 is the real numbers and formula_5 is a non-zero real number then formula_100 is defined even though formula_5 is not an integer). If this is the case then formula_49 will be called if the same equality holds:
formula_108

The notion of being is generalized similarly.

===Distributions (generalized functions)===
A continuous function formula_49 on formula_110 is homogeneous of degree formula_5 if and only if
formula_112
for all compactly supported test functions formula_113; and nonzero real formula_114 Equivalently, making a change of variable formula_115 formula_49 is homogeneous of degree formula_5 if and only if
formula_118
for all formula_119 and all test functions formula_120 The last display makes it possible to define homogeneity of distributions. A distribution formula_121 is homogeneous of degree formula_5 if
formula_123
for all nonzero real formula_119 and all test functions formula_120 Here the angle brackets denote the pairing between distributions and test functions, and formula_126 is the mapping of scalar division by the real number formula_114

==Glossary of name variants==

Let formula_85 be a map between two vector spaces over a field formula_129 (usually the real numbers formula_130 or complex numbers formula_131). If formula_121 is a set of scalars, such as formula_133 formula_134 or formula_135 for example, then formula_49 is said to be if 
formula_137 for every formula_87 and scalar formula_139 
For instance, every additive map between vector spaces is formula_140 although it might not be formula_141

The following commonly encountered special cases and variations of this definition have their own terminology:
#() : formula_142 for all formula_87 and all real formula_144
#* When the function formula_49 is valued in a vector space or field, then this property is logically equivalent to , which by definition means: formula_142 for all formula_87 and all real formula_148 It is for this reason that positive homogeneity is often also called nonnegative homogeneity. However, for functions valued in the extended real numbers formula_149 which appear in fields like convex analysis, the multiplication formula_150 will be undefined whenever formula_151 and so these statements are not necessarily always interchangeable.
#* This property is used in the definition of a sublinear function.
#* Minkowski functionals are exactly those non-negative extended real-valued functions with this property.
#: formula_142 for all formula_87 and all real formula_154
#* This property is used in the definition of a linear functional.
#: formula_155 for all formula_87 and all scalars formula_157 
#* It is emphasized that this definition depends on the scalar field formula_129 underlying the domain formula_159
#* This property is used in the definition of linear functionals and linear maps.
#: formula_160 for all formula_87 and all scalars formula_157
#* If formula_163 then formula_164 typically denotes the complex conjugate of formula_165. But more generally, as with semilinear maps for example, formula_164 could be the image of formula_165 under some distinguished automorphism of formula_168 
#* Along with additivity, this property is assumed in the definition of an antilinear map. It is also assumed that one of the two coordinates of a sesquilinear form has this property (such as the inner product of a Hilbert space).

All of the above definitions can be generalized by replacing the condition formula_142 with formula_170 in which case that definition is prefixed with the word or 
For example,
If formula_5 is a fixed real number then the above definitions can be further generalized by replacing the condition formula_142 with formula_173 (and similarly, by replacing formula_174 with formula_175 for conditions using the absolute value, etc.), in which case the homogeneity is said to be (where in particular, all of the above definitions are ).
For instance, 
A nonzero continuous function that is homogeneous of degree formula_5 on formula_177 extends continuously to formula_110 if and only if formula_179

<text>HMS &quot;Nubian&quot; was a of the Royal Navy in service from 1962 and 1979. She was named after the Nubian ethnic group, located in Egypt and Sudan. She was sunk as a target in 1987.

&quot;Nubian&quot; was built by Portsmouth Dockyard, at a cost of £4,360,000. She was launched on 6 September 1960 by Lady Holland-Martin, wife of Vice-Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin, and commissioned on 9 October 1962.

==Operational service==
In 1964, &quot;Nubian&quot; suffered a collision that caused minor damage. She joined the Beira Patrol off Mozambique in 1967, supporting the enforcement of an oil blockade of Rhodesia. &quot;Nubian&quot; constituted the escort providing radar coverage for the Daily Mail Trans-Atlantic Air Race in 1969 that commemorated the 50th Anniversary of Alcock and Brown&#x27;s non-stop transatlantic flight from Newfoundland to Britain. In 1971 she was present at Portsmouth Navy Days. In 1975, &quot;Nubian&quot; reinforced the British garrison in Belize after Guatemala intensified its threats to annex the territory.

&quot;Nubian&quot; was present at the 1977 Spithead Fleet Review, held in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. At this time she was part of the 5th Frigate Squadron.

In 1978, &quot;Nubian&quot; assisted in the cleanup after the supertanker &quot;Amoco Cadiz&quot; grounded off the coast of Brittany; more than 200,000 tons (180,000 metric tons) of oil had polluted the Brittany coastline.

&quot;Nubian&quot; entered the reserve in 1979, being placed in the Standby Squadron and put on the disposal list in 1981. While in reserve, &quot;Nubian&quot; became a training ship and had parts cannibalised for three sister-ships sold to Indonesia in 1984. The frigate was sunk as a target on 27 May 1987.

<doc id="622859" wikidata="Q1174594" url="?curid=622859" title="David Gray (snooker player)">
<text>David Gray (born 9 February 1979) is an English former professional snooker player from London.

Gray turned professional in 1996 after becoming the youngest-ever winner of the English Amateur Championship. He went on to win the 2003 Scottish Open, break into the top 16 in the world rankings and reach the final of the 2004 UK Championship (where he made his first of two competitive maximums). Despite these successes early in his career, his form declined until he eventually dropped off the tour in 2010 aged 31.

==Career==
Gray turned professional in 1996, after becoming the youngest winner of the English amateur title in 1995. Gray first qualified for the World Championship aged 19 in 1998 where he narrowly lost in round one to Alan McManus. He first demonstrated his potential by beating future seven-time World Champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 10–9 in the first round of the 2000 World Championship, a match in which O&#x27;Sullivan scored five . However, he was unable to repeat this success in the second round and lost 1–13 to Dominic Dale, scoring just 208 points, a record low for a best-of-25 match.

After winning the non-ranking 1998 Benson &amp; Hedges Championship and following his World Championship performance in 2000, Gray was a consistent tournament quarter-finalist over the next eighteen months, but did not reach his first ranking final until the 2002 Scottish Open. In this tournament, Gray eliminated defending champion Peter Ebdon 6–3 in the semi-finals, having already taken out Stephen Hendry and John Higgins. Stephen Lee eventually defeated Gray in the final, 9–2. However, in the same tournament a year later, Gray again eliminated Higgins and Hendry en route to the final, and this time won the event, defeating newcomer (and another eventual world champion) Mark Selby 9–7.

Although Gray was unable to qualify for the 2003 World Championship, his success at the 2003 Scottish Open (his only ranking tournament win) saw him break into the top 16 in the 2003/2004 world rankings, where he remained through 2005/2006. In the 2004 World Championship, he advanced to the quarter-finals, losing 13–9 to Graeme Dott. This performance helped him to no. 12 in the 2004/2005 world rankings (to date, his best-ever position).

On 28 November 2004 he reached his third – and to date, latest – ranking final in the UK Championship. He lost 10–1 to Stephen Maguire in the final. It was during this tournament that Gray scored his first maximum break – the 50th ever made in professional play – in the fifth frame of his last-32 match against Mark Selby (whom he had defeated in the 2003 Scottish Open final). His semi-final against Joe Perry was particularly memorable as Perry appeared to have won the match 9-7 by potting a colour leaving Gray requiring a snooker, but Perry himself was snookered on the next red, failed to hit it, and didn&#x27;t score another point as Gray cleared the table then hit a 139 total clearance in the deciding frame.

Gray defeated Jimmy White (his long-time practice partner) 10–5 at the 2006 World Championship, but in the second round Peter Ebdon beat Gray 13–2 with a , making Gray one of the few players to have lost two best-of-25-frame matches in a World Championship so emphatically. Gray never advanced beyond the quarter-finals in a World Championship.

In the 2006 Grand Prix, he advanced from the group stage (in which the world&#x27;s top 32 plus sixteen qualifiers are split into groups of six, who play each other round-robin with the two most successful players in each group progressing), before losing 2–5 to O&#x27;Sullivan in the last 16. He did not qualify for the 2007 World Championship, losing to 1991 winner John Parrott, and dropped out of the top 32 in the 2007/2008 rankings. A lack of success continued into the next season, with defeat to Liu Chuang in World Championship qualifying ensuring that he would be outside the top 40 of the rankings for the following year.

Gray fell off the circuit after the 2008–09 season but a World Snooker wildcard was awarded to him to allow him to remain on tour for the 2009–10 season.

After a disappointing 2009/2010 season he finished 77th for the 2010/2011 season and on 28 May 2011 Gray failed to qualify for the professional tour for the next season losing in the Q school qualifying stages.

After yet another poor performance in the Q school stages in May 2012 also saw him fail to qualify for the 2012/2013 professional tour.

The same was to follow in May 2013, as another poor performance in the Q School qualifying rounds led to disappointment, as he failed to qualify for the 2013/2014 tour. He did however enter himself into the first tournament of the season; the Bulgaria Open and was drawn against Gerard Greene in the last 128, however he withdrew from the tournament before it started and has not played another match since.

==Personal life==
On 7 October 2009, whilst on holiday in Thailand, Gray was found unconscious and rushed to hospital after blacking out. He was rescued by paramedics after being found collapsed and wearing only his underpants in a grove in the Thai holiday resort of Pattaya. He blacked out after drinking with friends and woke to find himself on a trolley in the Banglamung Hospital. 110sport Group chairman Lee Doyle said he will offer every assistance to help Gray.

<text>Liberty Village is a neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is bordered to the north by King Street West, to the west by Dufferin Street, to the south by the Gardiner Expressway, to the east by Strachan Avenue, and to the northeast by railway tracks.

==History==
In the 1850s, both the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Great Western Railway laid tracks across the community, cutting it off from rest of the city and altering plans to develop the area for residential purposes. Instead, Liberty Village became home to several institutions, including the Toronto Central Prison, opened in 1873, and the Andrew Mercer Reformatory for Women (on the site of today&#x27;s Lamport Stadium), opened in 1878 for women convicted of &quot;vagrancy&quot;, &quot;incorrigibility&quot;, or &quot;sexual precociousness.&quot; Provincial Secretary William John Hanna forced the closure of Central Prison in 1915, and all its buildings were demolished except for the paint shop and chapel. &quot;Liberty Street&quot;, for which Liberty Village is named, was the first street convicts from the two prisons would walk once freed.

The area&#x27;s proximity to the railway tracks led to its growth as an industrial area. In 1884, John Inglis and Company opened a factory to manufacture heavy machinery, boilers, and later, electrical appliances. Inglis&#x27; success led to its expansion onto Central Prison lands. In 1891, Massey-Harris (later Massey Ferguson) built a factory to produce agricultural implements. Other companies that established in the late 19th century included Toronto Carpet Manufacturing, St. David&#x27;s Wine, and Ontario Wind Engine and Pump.

Industry continued to flourish during the early 20th century due to the area&#x27;s excellent railway access and many spur lines, as well as a plentiful labour supply from nearby Parkdale. New companies included Brunswick-Balke-Collender (manufacturer of billiard tables and bowling alleys), Irwin Toy, Canada Metal, Simmons Bedding, Hinde and Dauch Paper, and Sunbeam Incandescent Lamp (later Canadian General Electric).

Many of the factories produced armaments, bombs, and weapons during both world wars, and much of the soil pollution in the area dates from those periods.

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, manufacturing operations within Liberty Village began to decline due to a shift from rail to road shipping, the need for larger manufacturing facilities, and lower manufacturing costs in suburban or offshore locations. In 1990, the Toronto Carpet Manufacturing plant on Liberty Street shut down, and the Inglis plant (owned by Whirlpool since 1985) ceased operations in 1991. The Inglis factory and Massey-Harris factory (with the exception of 947 King St. West) were demolished. Decreased industrial activity and lower property values caused many Liberty Village buildings to fall into neglect. During the 1970s and &#x27;80s the combination of low rent and large industrial spaces attracted visual artists seeking affordable studio space, creating an informal arts enclave.
The Liberty Village Business Improvement Area (BIA) was established in 2001 and serves as the representative organization for over 600 member businesses in the area. These businesses collectively employ over 10,000 individuals. Over the years, Liberty Village has undergone significant growth, with the addition of new condominiums, lofts, office spaces, as well as the development of a new park and a variety of shops and restaurants. These developments have contributed to the vibrant and thriving environment of Liberty Village.

The ongoing gentrification of downtown Toronto has been pushing farther outwards from downtown (see Queen Street West, Niagara, Distillery District), encouraging rapid development. It has become a trendy neighbourhood for young professionals and artists pushing farther west for less established areas, while still remaining a short walk or streetcar ride from the core. Many old factories have been repurposed as lofts while others have become restaurants, gyms, furniture stores and galleries, as this area was primarily a former heavy industrial area.

The industrial building that used to house a paper company and up until 2003, the Irwin Toy Factory, was converted into industrial residential lofts and mixed commercial use spaces. The Toronto Carpet Factory Building on Mowat Avenue and its surrounding campus of industrial structures is an example of 1900s&#x27; turn-of-the-century industrial architecture and currently houses a mixture of design, technology, media, and marketing companies. Old storage and factory spaces at Liberty Street and Hanna Avenue were converted into commercial spaces in the 1980s and 1990s, and they comprise Liberty Market. The Market houses design firms and collectives, media, technology, and marketing firms, and an eclectic mix of retail stores. Structures from the old Inglis Factory and the former Massey Ferguson Head Office surround the heart of Liberty Village, further testifying to the industrial history of the neighbourhood.

==Community==

In November 2011, a group of citizens formed the Liberty Village Residents&#x27; Association (LVRA) as a collective response to ongoing infrastructure issues and with a stated goal of creating social cohesion amongst the more than 25 000 people who call the Liberty Village area home. Within four years 95% of all condominiums in Liberty Village were members and it created six annual events attended by thousands every year. It has a Facebook Group with more than 14 000 members and an 84.1% participation rate, making it the virtual speakers corner and central information distribution source for the area. It exploded the typical model of residents&#x27; associations by being proactively business forward and targeting community interaction. It calls itself a &quot;YIMBY&quot; organization and its growth has been exponential. It is a legal not-for-profit run by volunteers and claims to be the &quot;Largest residents&#x27; association in North America&quot;. It has attracted significant sponsorship to provide connectivity for the community through events, outreach, and collective responses to neighbourhood and infrastructure issues (transit, daycare, safety). Its current major sponsor is a local Liberty Village communications company, Beanfield Metroconnect.

===Opinion on current residential design===
In an academic study of Liberty Village prepared by Thorben Wieditz in 2007, he wrote:
The area&#x27;s makeover is supported by newspaper articles that promote the area as an &quot;artsy loft district,&quot; a &quot;bohemian enclave,&quot; and a &quot;neighbourhood to live, work and play&quot; for people who want to be close to the entertainment district and to the gentrifying Queen Street West area. With the influx of large-scale developers, it is likely that the new developments will obliterate any trace of the &quot;artsy&quot; and &quot;bohemian&quot; residents who once populated the area.

Christopher Hume of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; wrote that &quot;Liberty Village illustrates everything that&#x27;s wrong with planning in Toronto,&quot; and that &quot;civic propaganda would have us believe Liberty Village is a shining example of urban vitality&quot;. Hume described Liberty Village as &quot;one huge parking lot after another&quot;, with very little green space.

&quot;Toronto Life&quot; described Liberty Village as a neighbourhood which has &quot;morphed from an industrial dead zone into an enclave of concrete, glass and brick in just a few years.&quot;

While preparing the Liberty Village Master Plan (2013), local residents were consulted on their general views and specific issues with the district. The responses were mixed. There were positive opinions expressed about Liberty Village&#x27;s &quot;sense of community&quot;, &quot;youthful...[and] village atmosphere&quot;, and &quot;sense of energy and vibrancy that comes from the concentration of creative sector businesses.&quot; Concerns were expressed about traffic congestion, the inadequacy and overcrowding of public transit, and the need to increase the diversity of the type of retail and social activities within Liberty Village. Also identified was need for improved infrastructure, such as better utilization of Lamport Stadium, and the construction of the proposed Liberty New Street along the south edge of the community.

Liberty Village&#x27;s desirable location and community has made it a magnet for development and there are currently (2018) 9 additional condominiums under construction adding a new park, bridge connections to Fort York and King St. West, retail, daycare and approximately 4,000 condominium units. From 2011 census to 2016 census Liberty Village&#x27;s density increased 3x.

==Transportation==
The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) operates the 504 King and the 29 Dufferin bus route in Liberty Village. At the southern end of Liberty Village there is access to Exhibition GO Station, served by commuter trains on GO Transit&#x27;s Lakeshore West line. By 2031, Exhibition Station will also be the southern terminus of the Ontario Line, a light metro line that will connect the area with neighborhoods such as Old East York and Corktown as well as with Line 1, Line 2, and Line 5 of the Toronto subway.

In 2017, a project to speed up travel times on streetcars along the central section of King Street was implemented.

===King-Liberty pedestrian bridge===
A pedestrian bridge to connect Liberty Village to neighbouring Niagara was approved in 2011 and construction began in 2018. The $11.5 million bridge would provide better access to both Liberty Village and Niagara which is currently cut off by the railway corridor with access to King Street either by travelling west to Dufferin Street or east to Strachan Avenue to travel north to King Street West. Both areas were once industrial lands but are now primarily residential. The steel truss span was added in September 2019 and opened in April 2021 but it has been plagued by elevator issues and graffiti since opening.

==In popular culture==
A documentary film on Liberty Village titled &quot;Liberty Village – Somewhere in Heaven&quot; was produced and directed by David Sloma for Rockin&#x27; Films. The film was released in 2006 (before much of the current development was completed) and features interviews with longtime Liberty Village residents Corky Laing (who provided music for the soundtrack via his band Cork), Taffi Rosen photographer/videographer, as well as other artists, business owners and workers in the area. The film was made in part with the support of the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) through their Filmmaker Assistance Program.

<doc id="622866" wikidata="Q5300579" url="?curid=622866" title="Doug Holyday">
<text>Douglas Charles Holyday (born 1942) is a retired Canadian politician who served as the last mayor of Etobicoke from 1994 to 1998 and the deputy mayor of Toronto from 2010 to 2013. Holyday was first elected to Etobicoke City Council as an alderman in 1982. After his term as mayor, he was elected to Toronto City Council, where he served until 2013, when he was elected as a member of Provincial Parliament (MPP).

==Political career==
An insurance broker by profession, Holyday was first elected to Etobicoke City Council as an alderman in 1982. He was defeated in his bid for the Etobicoke Board of Control in the 1985 municipal election but returned as an Etobicoke city councillor, representing Ward 6, from, 1988 until 1994 when he was elected Mayor. He also served as a member of the Metropolitan Toronto Council from 1994 until 1997.

He was the last mayor of the former city of Etobicoke, defeating incumbent Bruce Sinclair in the 1994 municipal election. After a garbage strike in 1995, Holyday and Etobicoke council tendered the garbage collection contract, and inviting CUPE and private operations to bid. Holyday noted that &quot;[CUPE&#x27;s] price was nowhere near what the private sector offered us&quot;, and noted that the contractor did the job with 35 employees as opposed to the previous 71. The move saved Etobicoke $1 million annual at the time, with city officials estimating it at $2 million in 2009, plus private contractors had to post a performance bond and commit to a wage rate for the duration of a five-year contract, which protected the city from a strike. In 1996, Etobicoke also bought out its employees&#x27; accumulated sick plan, with new employees not eligible for sick day accumulation.

Etobicoke was the only area in Toronto not affected by the 2009 garbage strike, with the sick day accumulation plan being one of the unresolved issues between the city and CUPE. Holyday also pointed out that 90 per cent of Canadian municipalities contract out garbage collection, with Oshawa being the only GTA municipality where garbage pickup is done by the city.

Etobicoke was amalgamated into Toronto with the 1997 election. With the position of Mayor of Etobicoke abolished, Holyday ran and was elected to the new Toronto City Council representing Ward 4 (Markland Centennial). With redistribution, Holyday was elected to the new Ward 3 in 1999 which he continued to represent until stepping down from council in 2013

One of Toronto council&#x27;s staunchest conservatives, he is noted for his fiscal conservatism and tendency to oppose public spending measures. For example, in 2008 Holyday proposed that taxpayers&#x27; money could be saved if Toronto city councillors reduced their office expenses, kept better track of business mileage, adopted more frugal newsletters, stopped donating to community groups and sports teams in their wards, and had to justify restaurant meals. In addition to his fiscal conservatism, Holyday has also supported conservative policies in other fields. For example, he opposed banning gun clubs in Toronto, as well as a decision by council to ban the Toronto Sportsmen’s Show from the CNE (council later reversed its decision). He has proposed removing the homeless from Nathan Phillips Square, and was the only member of council not to vote for a resolution describing homelessness as a national disaster. He once criticized plans to close certain streets in downtown Toronto for a &quot;car-free day&quot;, saying that that would have a negative impact on businesses. Holyday also supported reducing the number of councillors, and voted against childcare subsidies. In 2012, Holyday proposed that casino lobbyists be banned from city hall, stating &quot;I think the fairest way to do it is to take that part out of the equation&quot;.

Voters gave Holyday a clear majority in the 2003, 2006, and 2010 municipal elections, and no serious opponents came forward to challenge him.

===Provincial politics===
In 1987, Holyday ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1987 provincial election, but lost to Liberal Linda LeBourdais by over 6,000 votes. He was asked to run for the Tories in the 2003 provincial election, but declined.
In July 2013, Holyday again ran as a Progressive Conservative candidate in the August 1, 2013 by-election to replace retiring Liberal Laurel Broten in the riding of Etobicoke—Lakeshore. Although he once argued that councillors who run for higher office should immediately resign from council, he instead elected to take a leave of absence without pay. On election day, he defeated the Ontario Liberal Party&#x27;s candidate, fellow councillor Peter Milczyn.

On September 10, 2013 PC Leader Tim Hudak named Holyday as Tory Accountability critic.

He was defeated by Peter Milczyn in the Ontario general election of 2014.

==Personal life==
Holyday has lived his entire life in Etobicoke, and was an insurance broker before entering political life.
Doug Holyday Received the Key to the City of Toronto on 20 August 2013 from Mayor Rob Ford.

<doc id="622867" wikidata="Q3056796" url="?curid=622867" title="Hayedeh">
<text>Ma&#x27;soumeh Dadehbala (; April 10, 1942 – January 20, 1990), known professionally as Hayedeh (), was an Iranian singer with a contralto vocal range. Known for her wide range of voice, her career spanned over two decades, and she has been widely described as one of the most popular and influential musicians of Iran.

==Early life and career==
Ma&#x27;soumeh Dadehbala was born on April 10, 1942 in Tehran. She was the elder sister of another popular singer Mahasti.

Her professional career began in 1968 as a singer on a Persian traditional music program in Radio Tehran called &quot;Golhâye Rangârang&quot; ( &quot;Colorful Flowers&quot;) directed by Davoud Pirnia.

Hayedeh studied &quot;Avaz&quot; (Persian vocal music) with the Persian violinist and composer Ali Tajvidi.

&quot;Azadeh&quot; (1968), which was composed by Ali Tajvidi, with lyrics by Rahi Moayeri, was Hayedeh&#x27;s first official hit and debut also. It was first performed in 1968 on Radio Tehran with the Gol-ha Orchestra. In this year she released another titled &quot;Raftam&quot; (1968).

In the 1970s, Hayedah added Persian pop music to her classical Persian repertoire. In this period Hayedeh worked with several songwriters, such as Fereydoun Khoshnoud, Jahanbakhsh Pazouki, Anoushiravan Rohani and Mohammad Heydari. &quot;Bezan Tar&quot;, &quot;Gol-e Sang&quot;, &quot;Nowrouz Aamad&quot;, and &quot;Soghati&quot; were among her works during this period.

With Mahasti, Hayedeh recorded duets such as &quot;Doa &amp; Delam Mikhad&quot; (I pray and I want) it was successful for release.

==Leaving Iran==
On August 29, 1978, Hayedeh immigrated to the United Kingdom. The next year, Iran underwent an Islamic Revolution. She stayed there for three years and moved to the United States in 1982 to continue her singing career.

Caltex Records, an Iranian recording label, supported Hayedeh in her career.

Hayedeh lived in Los Angeles from 1982 until the end of her life. The area became a hub for the Persian (Iranian) community in Southern California since the 1980s.

Hayedeh released many successful albums during this time, and all her songs were bootlegged in Iran. Hayedeh&#x27;s political and nostalgic songs such as &quot;Rouzaye Roshan&quot;, &quot;Ghesseyeh Man&quot;, &quot;Zendegi&quot; became very popular with the Iranian exile community.

Her songwriters and producers in the United States were mostly Sadegh Nojouki and Mohammad Heydari. Songwriters she worked with were Ardalan Sarfaraz, Homa Mir-Afshar and Bijan Samandar. Songwriter who wrote more than 30 of Hayedeh&#x27;s songs and hits was her best friend Leila Kasra (a.k.a. Hedieh), who was featured in many of her albums reciting her poems. During her exile, Hayedeh regularly appeared on the Los Angeles-based Persian-language TV channels IRTV, Jaam-E-Jam and Jonbesh TV.

==Death and burial==

On January 20, 1990, the day after a performance at the Casablanca Club, near San Francisco, California, Hayedeh died from a heart attack. She was 47 years old. She had a history of diabetes and hypertension.

Thousands of fans attended Hayedeh&#x27;s funeral in Los Angeles. On January 24, 1990, she was buried at the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. She had been recording an album shortly before her death and was due to finish recording it after she returned from her concert in San Francisco.

Every year, her fans honor her memory on her birthday or the anniversary of her death in the virtual space or at her grave.

Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery management named Hayedeh funeral as one of the largest funerals of the 20th century.

On April 10, 2022, at the same time as Haydeh&#x27;s 80th birthday, her tombstone was changed in the presence of her family and fans. Also, the mayor of Los Angeles praised and thanked her for her years of artistic activities and called her a part of the cultural heritage of the city of Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
Hayedeh&#x27;s albums are still best sellers and her songs are played on Persian TV and radio channels outside Iran. Many of her songs are sung by Iranian pop singers. Houshmand Aghili performed Hayedeh&#x27;s &quot;Sarab&quot;, Parviz Rahman Panah remixed her &quot;Saal&quot;, Shahla Sarshar performed a tragic song called &quot;In Memory of Hayedeh&quot;, singer Amir did a cover of Hayedeh&#x27;s song &quot;Soghati&quot; in 2008 and Mahasti performed three songs in memory of her late sister.
According to Prof. Erik Nakhjavani in &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;: &quot;Analogous to Delkash, before her, Hayedeh sang with technical authority and passionate energy. Her laryngeal control made it possible for her to produce a series of graceful vibrato and glissando vocalizations required by the &quot;Avaz&quot; Persian vocal music. She could smoothly pass from the upper reaches of her alto voice to the lower, fuller, and darker range of the contralto. This mixture of strong laryngeal strength and learned vocal technique gave her alto-contralto voice a rare, powerful resonance and texture in the performance of the Avaz. Furthermore an acute sense for musical timing, the rhythmic flow of vocal music, affective musical phrasing, and poetic delivery enabled her to express and interpret effectively any songs she sang.&quot;

Iranian pianist and journalist Pejman Akbarzadeh made a documentary &quot;&quot; about Hayedeh which was screened in Amsterdam in January 2009 for the first time. The documentary had its US premiere in May 2009 at the Noor Iranian Film Festival in Los Angeles and nominated as the Best Documentary at the festival. The film was also screened at 9th International Exile Film Festival (Sweden) and 4th Iranian Film Festival in the Netherlands. Tehran-based FARS News Agency (close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard) cited the documentary as a film on the &quot;Corrupt monarchist singer Hayedeh&quot;. The documentary was released on DVD on 20 January 2010, the 20th anniversary of Hayedeh&#x27;s death, by &quot;Persian Dutch Network&quot; in Amsterdam. Various American universities have streamed the documentary on their server for educational purposes as well.

In April 2019 the Los Angeles City Council recognized and celebrated Hayedeh, one of the most celebrated singers in Persian culture.

<text>Ivo Van Damme (21 February 1954 – 29 December 1976) was a Belgian middle-distance runner.

Van Damme played football until he was 16, but then switched to athletics. His breakthrough came in 1973, when he placed fourth in the 800 m at the European Junior Championships.

He suffered from mononucleosis the following season, but returned strong beating Roger Moens&#x27;s 1955 national 800 m record. The record stood for 48 years and was finally bettered by Eliott Crestan in 2024. In 1976, he won the European indoor title over this distance, and was one of the favourites for a medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. He eventually ended up second in both the 800 and 1500 m, finishing behind Alberto Juantorena and John Walker, respectively.

These were his last successes, as Van Damme was killed in a car accident later that year while travelling home from Marseille in southern France. He was to marry Rita Thijs in 1977. Since 1977, a memorial competition has been held in Brussels to remember him, the &quot;Memorial Van Damme,&quot; which is now the championship final for selected disciplines of the &quot;Diamond League&quot; athletics tour.

<doc id="622873" wikidata="Q1862957" url="?curid=622873" title="The Empire Strikes First">
<text>The Empire Strikes First is the thirteenth studio album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on June 8, 2004. The album is heavily influenced by the then-current Iraq War (most notably in the songs &quot;Atheist Peace&quot;, &quot;Let Them Eat War&quot; and the title track) and also has some nods to George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (the song title &quot;Boot Stamping on a Human Face Forever&quot; as well as the line &quot;you deserve Two Minute Hate&quot; in the title track are direct references to the book), the latter most likely inspired by the Patriot Act.

The album also marks the rare instance that non-members of Bad Religion received a writing credit, as Chris Wollard of Hot Water Music co-wrote two songs.

The song &quot;Social Suicide&quot; appears in the video games &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Project 8&quot; and &quot;MX vs. ATV Untamed&quot;.

==Release==
On February 4, 2004, &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot; was announced for release in a few months&#x27; time. On March 17, 2004, the album&#x27;s artwork and the track listing were posted online. &quot;Sinister Rouge&quot; was made available for download through the label&#x27;s website on April 11, 2004. &quot;Los Angeles Is Burning&quot; was released to radio on April 27, 2004. They toured Europe in May 2004, where they debuted several new songs from the album. &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot; was released on June 8, 2004. The following day, the music video for &quot;Los Angeles Is Burning&quot; was posted on the label&#x27;s website. Soon afterwards, they appeared at the KROQ Weenie Roast. In October and November 2004, the band went on a tour of the US with Rise Against and From First to Last. After playing a series of multi-day stints in venues in the US in June 2005, Bad Religion toured across Europe in August and September 2005, which included an appearance at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. In October and November 2005, they went on a North American trek with Anti-Flag and Pennywise.

==Reception==

It peaked at number 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, the highest position the band had attained at the time. The album scored a minor radio hit with, &quot;Los Angeles Is Burning&quot;, which also reached No. 40 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; ranked &quot;Los Angeles Is Burning&quot; at number 90 on their list of the best 100 singles from the 2000s.

<text>Svetlana Pesotskaya (born 9 January 1975) is a television reporter in Moscow who gained international attention for her practice of stripping during newscasts. Before becoming a television journalist, Pesotskaya was an actress and model.

After Communism, Russian television channels struggled to gain viewers because of low budgets and lack of programming. To attract viewers, the M1 Network began experimenting in November 1999 with having Pesotskaya strip while delivering the news. The ratings soared and the show, renamed &quot;Golaya Pravda&quot; (&quot;The Naked Truth&quot;), became the most widely viewed news program in Russia. Pesotskaya took off her clothes on camera daily with a pair of hands, strategically placed as the only thing to preserve her decency.

In an MTV documentary about curious television moments, she was wrongly identified as &quot;Deborah Norvilovich&quot;, a pun on Deborah Norville.

<text>Marcus Elieser Bloch (1723–1799) was a German physician and naturalist who is best known for his contribution to ichthyology through his multi-volume catalog of plates illustrating the fishes of the world. Brought up in a Hebrew-speaking Jewish family, he learned German and Latin and studied anatomy before settling in Berlin as a physician. He amassed a large natural history collection, particularly of fish specimens. He is generally considered one of the most important ichthyologists of the 18th century, and wrote many papers on natural history, comparative anatomy, and physiology.

==Life==
Bloch was born at Ansbach in 1723 where his father was a Torah writer and his mother owned a small shop. Educated at home in Hebrew literature he became a private tutor in Hamburg for a Jewish surgeon. Here he learned German, Latin and anatomy. He then studied medicine in Berlin and received a doctorate in 1762 from Frankfort on the Oder with a treatise on skin disorders. He then became a general practitioner in Berlin and married Breinche, daughter of &quot;protected Jew&quot; Ruben Joseph Rintel (1699–1765?) in 1765. This allowed him to settle in Berlin. Bloch helped found the Society of Friends of Natural Sciences in 1773 along with Moses Mendelssohn serving also as Mendelssohn&#x27;s physician. He began to establish a large natural history collection and a library. He also began to publish in journals. Breinche died in 1769 and their only son died aged 21 while on a trip to Paris to sell the book on fishes that his father had written. In 1774 he married Cheile, daughter of banker Joseph Veitel Ephraim (1775–1807) and they had a daughter who married physician Wolf Davidson (1772–1800). After the death of Cheile, he married Rahel, daughter of a Jewish social worker Jeremias Bendix (1735 -1790), and they had a son and two daughters.

Bloch became interested in fishes only in 1782 after finding fish that he could not find a name for in the works of Linnaeus. He then began to collect fishes and had fish specimens sent from around the world, including correspondents from as far as India like Johann Gerhard König and Christoph Samuel John. The collection was of nearly 1400 specimens and about 800 are now in the Bloch Cabinet of the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin. He began to catalog the fishes of Germany in publications from 1782 to 1784, and on fishes from abroad until 1795, printing the books with copper plate engravings made largely at his own expense. He later managed to get subscribers including the Queen and Prince of Prussia, the Prince of Saxe-Coburg, the royal families of Denmark, Sweden, Poland and the court banker Isaac Daniel Itzig. Bloch also published on medicine, writing on such topics as the waters of Pyrmont and on intestinal parasitic worms.

Bloch visited Paris in 1797 to examine the fish collections there and returned via Holland. His health became poor and he went to Carlsbad where he died of a stroke. He was buried in the Jewish cemetery at Lichtenstadt.

==Works and legacy==


Bloch is best known for his encyclopedic work in ichthyology. Between 1782 and 1795 he published his &quot;Allgemeine Naturgeschichte der Fische&quot;, a 12-volume, beautifully illustrated comprehensive work on fishes. The first three volumes describe fishes in Germany and were entitled &quot;Oeconomische Naturgeschichte der Fische Deutschlands&quot;, the remaining volumes (in 9 parts) dealt with fishes from other parts of the world and were entitled &quot;Naturgeschichte der ausländischen Fische&quot;. A French translation &quot;Ichthyologie, ou histoire naturelle, générale et particulière des poissons&quot; was published in 12 volumes between 1785 and 1797. His &quot;Systema Ichthologia&quot; was published posthumously by Johann G. Schneider. Bloch followed the fish systematics of Peter Artedi and Carl Linnaeus although he added new systematic characters including the presence or absence of a fifth gill, gill structure, and bony arches. He described at least 267 new species and 19 genera and several of his binomial names are still in use. Bloch&#x27;s collection of about 800 surviving specimens is preserved at the Museum für Naturkunde of the Humboldt University of Berlin.

<doc id="622880" wikidata="Q413581" url="?curid=622880" title="Bromocriptine">
<text>Bromocriptine, originally marketed as Parlodel and subsequently under many brand names, is an ergoline derivative and dopamine agonist that is used in the treatment of pituitary tumors, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, hyperprolactinaemia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and, as an adjunct, type 2 diabetes.
It was patented in 1968 and approved for medical use in 1975.

==Medical uses==
Bromocriptine is used to treat acromegaly and conditions associated with hyperprolactinemia like amenorrhea, infertility, hypogonadism, and prolactin-secreting adenomas. It is also used to prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Since the late 1980s it has been used, off-label, to reduce the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal but the evidence for this use is poor. Bromocriptine has been successfully used in cases of galactorrhea precipitated by dopamine antagonists like risperidone.

A quick-release formulation of bromocriptine, Cycloset, is also used to treat type 2 diabetes. When administered within 2 hours of awakening, it increases hypothalamic dopamine level. That results to a significant weight loss as well as decreases in blood glucose levels, hepatic glucose production, and insulin resistance. It therefore acts as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control and cardiovascular risk.

==Side effects==
Most frequent side effects are nausea, orthostatic hypotension, headaches, and vomiting through stimulation of the brainstem vomiting centre. Vasospasms with serious consequences such as myocardial infarction and stroke that have been reported in connection with the puerperium, appear to be extremely rare events. Peripheral vasospasm (of the fingers or toes) can cause Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon.

Bromocriptine use has been anecdotally associated with causing or worsening psychotic symptoms (its mechanism is in opposition of most antipsychotics, whose mechanisms generally block dopamine receptors). It should be understood, however, that the greater affinity bromocriptine and many similar antiparkinson&#x27;s drugs have for the D2S receptor form (considered to be mostly present at inhibitory D2 autoreceptor locatations) relative to the D2L form, sufficiently low partial agonist activity (ie where a molecule binding to a receptor induces limited effects while preventing a stronger ligand like dopamine from binding), and, possibly, the functional selectivity of a particular drug may generate antidopaminergic effects that are more similar than oppositional in nature to antipsychotics.

Pulmonary fibrosis has been reported when bromocriptine was used in high doses for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Use to suppress milk production after childbirth was reviewed in 2014 and it was concluded that in this context a causal association with serious cardiovascular, neurological or psychiatric events could not be excluded with an overall incidence estimated to range between 0.005% and 0.04%. Additional safety precautions and stricter prescribing rules were suggested based on the data. It is a bile salt export pump inhibitor.

After long-term use of dopamine agonists, a withdrawal syndrome may occur during dose reduction or discontinuation with the following possible side effects: anxiety, panic attacks, dysphoria, depression, agitation, irritability, suicidal ideation, fatigue, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, generalized pain, and drug cravings. For some individuals, these withdrawal symptoms are short-lived and they make a full recovery, for others a protracted withdrawal syndrome may occur with withdrawal symptoms persisting for months or years.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Bromocriptine is a partial agonist of the dopamine D2 receptor. It also interacts with other dopamine receptors and with various serotonin and adrenergic receptors. Bromocriptine has additionally been found to inhibit the release of glutamate by reversing the GLT1 glutamate transporter.

Despite acting as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist, bromocriptine is described as non-hallucinogenic.

As a silent antagonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, bromocriptine has been said not to pose a risk of cardiac valvulopathy. This is in contrast to other ergolines acting instead as 5-HT2B receptor agonists such as cabergoline and pergolide but is similar to lisuride which likewise acts as a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist. However, in other research, bromocriptine has subsequently been found to be a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor and has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy and related complications. In any case, bromocriptine seems to have lower risk than certain other drugs.

==Chemistry==
Like all ergopeptides, bromocriptine is a cyclol; two peptide groups of its tripeptide moiety are crosslinked, forming the &gt;N-C(OH)&lt; juncture between the two rings with the amide functionality.

Bromocriptine is a semisynthetic derivative of a natural ergot alkaloid, ergocryptine (a derivative of lysergic acid), which is synthesized by bromination of ergocryptine using &quot;N&quot;-bromosuccinimide.

==History==
Bromocriptine was discovered by scientists at Sandoz in 1965 and was first published in 1968; it was first marketed under the brand name Parlodel.

A quick-release formulation of bromocriptine was approved by the FDA in 2009.

<text>The Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM; ), branded as The Royal Conservatory, is a non-profit music education institution and performance venue headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1886 by Edward Fisher as The Toronto Conservatory of Music. In 1947, King George VI incorporated the organization through royal charter. Its Toronto home was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1995, in recognition of the institution&#x27;s influence on music education in Canada. Tim Price is the current Chair of the Board, and Peter Simon is the President.

==History==

===Early history===

The conservatory was founded in 1886 as The Toronto Conservatory of Music and opened in September 1887, located on two floors above a music store at the corner of Dundas Street (Wilton Street) and Yonge Street (at today&#x27;s Yonge Dundas Square). Its founder Edward Fisher was a young organist born in the United States. The conservatory became the first institution of its kind in Canada: a school dedicated to the training of singers and instrumentalists, and also to instilling a love of music in young children. In its first year, it hired Italian musician and composer Francesco D&#x27;Auria to teach at the conservatory.

The conservatory&#x27;s initial intake was just over 100, and by its second quarter this number had grown to nearly 300 as its reputation quickly spread. In 1897, the organization purchased a new property at College Street and University Avenue (now site of the Intact Centre) to accommodate its rapid expansion. From its earliest days, it was affiliated with the University of Toronto with the purpose of preparing students for degree examinations and shared its premises with the University of Toronto, Faculty of Music from 1919.

In 1906, Frank Welsman – who became the principal of the conservatory – founded and directed the Toronto Conservatory Orchestra, which became the Toronto Symphony Orchestra two years later.

===Toronto College of Music and Canadian Academy of Music===
The period between 1918 and 1924 witnessed a series of mergers among music conservatories in Toronto. The Toronto College of Music was founded in 1888 by conductor F.H. Torrington, and became the first music conservatory affiliated with the University of Toronto. After Torrington&#x27;s death in 1917, the school merged with the Canadian Academy of Music in 1918. The academy itself had been founded in 1911 by Albert Gooderham, who financed the school out of his own personal fortune and served as the school&#x27;s only president during its 13-year history. The academy, in turn, merged into the Toronto Conservatory of Music in 1924.

===Post-war growth===
Glenn Gould – arguably the conservatory&#x27;s most outstanding pupil – studied theory, organ, and piano, graduating at the age of 12 in 1946 with an ARCT diploma of the highest honours.

In 1947, King George VI awarded the conservatory its royal charter in recognition of its status as one of the Commonwealth&#x27;s greatest music schools. The Toronto Conservatory of Music became The Royal Conservatory of Music.

During Ettore Mazzoleni&#x27;s term as principal (1945–68), the conservatory grew rapidly. Mazzoleni had been director of the Conservatory Orchestra since 1934. Two other prominent figures who contributed to the achievements of this period were chairman of the board Edward Johnson (who served from 1947 to 1959) and Arnold Walter, who was appointed director of the new Senior School in 1946. The Senior School offered a two-year program with professional performance training combined with related courses in theory and history. The initial success of the project gave rise to a three-year program leading to an Artist Diploma, as well as the conservatory&#x27;s Opera School (begun in 1946), which provided training in all aspects of opera production. These developments led to the creation of the Royal Conservatory Opera Company, which went on to become the Canadian Opera Company in 1959.

With space now a major problem, the University of Toronto sold the College Street property to Ontario Hydro in 1962 (demolished to make way for the Ontario Power Building in 1975), and the conservatory moved to 273 Bloor Street West, the original site of McMaster University or McMaster Hall as well as Castle Memorial Hall. The concert and recital halls of the College Street site were only partially replaced in the move, and the library, residence, and all three pipe organs were lost.

===Independent institution===
The conservatory was governed by the University of Toronto from 1963 until 1991, at which time it became a wholly independent institution again, taking control of its building and diverse music programs. Peter Simon was appointed president of the conservatory.

Also in 1991, the conservatory developed a master plan to renovate its historic building and expand it with the construction of new facilities on the same site. The plan was carried out by Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB) in stages, initially with the 1997 renovation of Mazzoleni Concert Hall in the historic Ihnatowycz Hall. The plans for this renovation are held at the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal. The new construction is named the TELUS Centre for Performance and Learning and features academic and performance spaces; the acoustically sound, 1,135-seat Koerner concert venue; studios; classrooms; a new-media centre; a library; and a rehearsal hall. During the renovations, the conservatory temporarily moved to the former location of the Toronto District School Board&#x27;s Ursula Franklin Academy in the Dufferin and Bloor West area. In September 2008, the conservatory returned to a newly renovated and expanded headquarters at 273 Bloor Street West near Avenue Road. Koerner Hall opened on 25 September 2009, beginning a new age of large-scale performances at The Royal Conservatory.

The original building, McMaster Hall, was renamed Ihnatowycz Hall in 2005, in reference to the contribution of alumni Ian Ihnatowycz and Marta Witer. The designation of this site as a heritage building required that the majority of the original materials and formal qualities be maintained while complying with the building code. The original brickwork was maintained: decorative red brick, Medina sandstone, and polished granite. The imposing manner of the building demonstrates the prominent form of the building.

==Arts education programs==
The Royal Conservatory is a not-for-profit organization offering a wide range of arts programs.

===The Royal Conservatory Certificate Program===
This is the division of The Royal Conservatory that sets and supports standards in music examinations across Canada and internationally. The organization conducts 100,000 examinations annually in over 300 communities around the world.

Examinations are conducted three or four times each year in more than 300 communities through a network of local centres. The Certificate Program encompasses all levels and spans 11 grades: from beginner to certification as an Associate of The Royal Conservatory of Music (ARCT), to certification as a Licentiate of The Royal Conservatory of Music (LRCM).

Achievement on the examinations of The Royal Conservatory is recognized for credit toward secondary school graduation in many school systems in Canada. For most provinces in Canada, a Level 6 Certificate and Level 6 Theory (formerly Intermediate Rudiments) counts as Grade 10 credit, a Level 7 Certificate and Level 6 or Level 7 Theory (also formerly Intermediate Rudiments) counts as Grade 11 credit, and a Level 8 Certificate and Level 8 Theory (formerly Advanced Rudiments) counts as Grade 12 credit. One&#x27;s standing in the Certificate Program also plays an important role in entrance requirements for professional music programs at many universities and colleges.
===The Royal Conservatory Music Development Program===
In 2011 The Royal Conservatory partnered with Carnegie Hall to launch The Achievement Program in the United States. In January 2013 The Royal Conservatory took on sole responsibility of the successful program under the name The Royal Conservatory Music Development Program. Developed to provide a national standard for all learners, in 2016 The Music Development Program was merged with The RCM Certificate Program.

===The Frederick Harris Music Co., Limited===

The Frederick Harris Music Co. Limited, is the oldest and largest print-music publisher in Canada.

Frederick Harris (1866–1945) devoted his life to music publishing. He began his career in England working for a large music publishing firm. In 1904, he set up his own business in London and in 1910, established a Canadian office in Toronto – marking the beginning of a long association with The Royal Conservatory that led to an increased emphasis on publications for teaching and learning.
In 1944, the company was donated to the conservatory with profits to be used for its own purposes.
===The Glenn Gould School===

A centre for professional training in classical music performance at the postsecondary and postbachelor levels, The Glenn Gould School was established in 1987. Originally called The Royal Conservatory of Music Professional School, it was renamed in 1997 to honour Glenn Gould, the Toronto-born piano virtuoso and a former pupil. Enrollment is limited to 130, and The School is supported by funding from the Department of Canadian Heritage through the National Arts Contribution Program. It has become one of the most highly respected music conservatories in North America, and the world.

The faculty consists of internationally acclaimed performers, teachers, and scholars. More than 125 master classes are presented each year with artists, such as, Stewart Goodyear, Anton Kuerti, and James Ehnes.

Glenn Gould School alumni have established careers as solo performers, orchestral musicians, chamber musicians, and recording artists. Alumni include the pianist Jan Lisiecki, singers Isabel Bayrakdarian and Robert Gleadow, the pianists David Jalbert and Richard Raymond, the harpist Mariko Anraku, the violist Adam Romer, as well as the St. Lawrence String Quartet.

The Glenn Gould School offers an accredited four-year Bachelor of Music (Honours) degree in Music Performance in piano, voice, and all orchestral instruments, designed for high school graduates who wish to prepare for a career as a performer. The Artist Diploma is a two-year postbachelor program for piano, voice, orchestral instruments, performance, and pedagogy.
 The school also offers The Rebanks Family Fellowship and Performance Diploma Program, a one-year career development program for aspiring classical musicians.
===The Phil and Eli Taylor Performance Academy for Young Artists===
After a competitive audition and interview, accepted students are streamed into Junior, Intermediate, or Senior Academy programs. This comprehensive program develops performance skills, musicianship, and academic excellence. Most Academy activities take place on Friday evenings and Saturdays but students are expected to practice daily and work on regular assignments. Through the support of private individuals and foundations, financial assistance is available for all students. Alumni of the academy who have launched successful careers include Peter Simon, Katie Stillman, Eugene Nakamura, Marcin Swoboda, Janice LaMarre, Marta and Irena Kretchkovsky, and Karen Ouzounian.

==Performing arts==

The Royal Conservatory presents approximately 100 performances a year, featuring classical, jazz, world, and pop music artists from around the world. It has three concert venues: Koerner Hall, Mazzoleni Concert Hall, and Temerty Theatre.

===Koerner Hall===
Named for donors Michael and Sonja Koerner, Koerner Hall opened in September 2009 and houses 1,135 seats. It was designed by KPMB Architects, under the direction of Marianne McKenna, theatre consultant Anne Minors Performance Consultants, and acoustics company Sound Space Design. It features two balcony tiers above the main orchestra level as well as a third technical balcony. Koerner Hall&#x27;s signature element is an acoustically transparent veil of twisting oak strings that forms the backdrop for the chorus at the first balcony level, then hovers over the stage below the fixed acoustic canopy, extending into and over the hall at the technical balcony level. Completion of the project also includes three tiers of glass fronted lobbies overlooking Philosopher&#x27;s Walk, back-of-house areas for performers, a ground-floor café, and installation of a unique collection of antique musical instruments donated by the Koerner family and valued at $1 million. Each level is also equipped to host a variety of private functions.

===Mazzoleni Concert Hall===
Mazzoleni Concert Hall has and 237 seats. When it opened in 1901, it was known as Castle Memorial Hall. At that time it had a chapel with stained glass windows on the ground floor level and a library on the lower level. By the 1960s, the University of Toronto, which used the space as a lecture hall, had bricked up the windows and removed a rear balcony. In 1996, restoration began. Mazzoleni Concert Hall was named in honour of Ettore Mazzoleni, a former principal of the conservatory.

===Temerty Theatre===
&quot;A granite cube which floats above Bloor Street,&quot; this multipurpose performance and event space is located on level 2 of the TELUS Centre for Performance and Learning. It has space for up to 150 seats and is designed to accommodate a range of functions, including special events, performance, rehearsals, and &quot;Learning Through the Arts™&quot; activities. In scale and proportion, the Conservatory Theatre replicates the acoustic quality and stage size of Koerner Hall to prepare students for live performance. The venue is named in honour of James and Louise Temerty.

==ARC Ensemble==
Established in 2002, the ARC Ensemble (Artists of The Royal Conservatory) is composed of senior faculty members of the conservatory&#x27;s Glenn Gould School in Toronto and led by artistic director Simon Wynberg.

The ensemble has been nominated for three Grammy Awards. Its current album, dedicated to the works of Polish-American composer Jerzy Fitelberg, was nominated in the categories of Best Chamber Music Performance and Producer of the Year, Classical (David Frost). The ensemble has also received Grammy nominations for its 2007 recording &quot;On the Threshold of Hope&quot;, and its 2008 album &quot;Right Through The Bone&quot;, devoted to the music of German-Dutch composer Julius Röntgen.

<text>Aspendos or Aspendus (Pamphylian: ΕΣΤϜΕΔΥΣ; Attic: Ἄσπενδος) was an ancient Greco-Roman city in Antalya province of Turkey. The site is located 40 km east of the modern city of Antalya.

It was situated on the Eurymedon River about 16 km inland from the Mediterranean Sea; it shared a border with, and was hostile to, the ancient city of Side.

== History ==

The wide range of its coinage throughout the ancient world indicates that, in the 5th century BC, Aspendos had become the most important city in Pamphylia. At that time, according to Thucydides, the Eurymedon River was navigable as far as Aspendos, and the city derived great wealth from a trade in salt, oil and wool.

Aspendos did not play an important role in antiquity as a political force. Its political history during the colonisation period corresponded to the currents of the Pamphylian region. Within this trend, after the colonial period, it remained for a time under Lycian hegemony. In 546 BC, it came under Persian domination. The fact that the city continued to mint coins in its own name, however, indicates that it had a great deal of freedom even under the Persians.

Circa 465 BC, Cimon led an Athenian navy against a Persian navy in the Battle of the Eurymedon, and destroyed it. Aspendos then became a member of the Delian League.

The Persians captured the city again in 411 BC and used it as a base. In 389 BC, Thrasybulus of Athens, in an effort to regain some of the prestige that city had lost in the Peloponnesian Wars, anchored off the coast of Aspendos in an effort to secure its surrender. Hoping to avoid a new war, the people of Aspendos collected money among themselves and gave it to the commander, entreating him to retreat without causing any damage. Even though he took the money, he had his men trample all the crops in the fields. Enraged, the Aspendians stabbed and killed Thrasybulus in his tent.
When Alexander the Great marched into Aspendos in 333 BC after capturing Perge, the citizens sent envoys asking him not to garrison soldiers there. He agreed, provided he would be given the taxes and horses that they had formerly paid as tribute to the Persian king. After reaching this agreement Alexander went to Side, leaving a garrison there on the city&#x27;s surrender. Going back through Sillyon, he learned that the Aspendians had failed to ratify the agreement their envoys had proposed and were preparing to defend themselves. Alexander marched to the city immediately. When they saw Alexander returning with his troops, the Aspendians, who had retreated to their Acropolis, again sent envoys to sue for peace. This time, however, they had to agree to very harsh terms; a Macedonian garrison would remain in the city and 100 gold talents as well as 4,000 horses would be given in tax annually.

In 190 BC, the city surrendered to the Romans, and the corrupt magistrate Verres later pillaged its art treasures. It was ranked by Philostratus the third city of Pamphylia, and in Byzantine times seems to have been known as Primopolis. Toward the end of the Roman period the city began a decline that continued throughout Byzantine times, although in medieval times it was evidently still a strong place.

Diogenes Laërtius writes that there was a native of Aspendos called Demetrius, who was a pupil of Apollonius of Soli. In addition, he mentions Diodorus of Aspendus.

==Greek and Roman structures==

Aspendos is known for having the best-preserved theatre of antiquity, the Roman Theatre of Aspendos. With a diameter of 96 metres (315 ft), it provided seating for 7,000. 
Even though, the recent Aspendus Culture and Film Festival has shown that it can hold over 20,000.
It was built in 155 by the Greek architect Zenon, a native of the city. It was periodically repaired by the Seljuqs, who used it as a caravanserai, and in the 13th century the stage building was converted into a palace by the Seljuqs of Rum.

As was usual to minimise construction complexity and cost, part of the theatre was built against the hill where the Citadel (Acropolis) stood, while the remainder was built on vaulted arches. The high stage, whose supporting columns are still in place, served to seemingly isolate the audience from the rest of the world. The &quot;scaenae frons&quot;, or backdrop, has remained intact. The 8.1 metre (27 ft) sloping reflective wooden ceiling over the stage has been lost over time. Post holes for 58 masts are found in the upper level of the theatre. These masts supported a &quot;velarium&quot; or awning that could be pulled over the audience to provide shade. The diameter of the orchestra is 23.87 meters and the height of the columnatio (stage backdrop) was 15.7 meters.

The unique 19 km-long Roman aqueduct is possibly the most important monument, since the last 2 km of the conduit is a well-preserved inverted siphon, rather than an open channel, which made this aqueduct famous. The siphon allowed shorter arches to be constructed at the expense of finding a way to contain the water pressure in the siphon in an era when large diameter piping was difficult to seal. The siphon was split into three bridge sections 600, 900 and 150 m long, separated by 5.5 m square two towers where the aqueduct bends and where the water ascended and descended and which are today still 30 m high. The siphon was built on arches to cross the marshy valley between the hills and the town. The central section consisted of 46 arches up to 15 m high, 29 of which are still standing. The siphon was 40 m deep between the towers leading to a pressure of 400kPa (4bar) in the pipes and delivered about 5600 m3 per day. The pipes were carved blocks of limestone carefully fitted together to ensure a good seal using a mortar of lime and olive oil which expands when wet. It was built between the middle of the 2nd and end of the 3rd century. An inscription states Tiberius Claudius Italicus spent 2 million denarii to build an aqueduct here.

Nearby stand the remains of a stadium, baths, basilica, agora and nymphaeum. The Roman Eurymedon Bridge, reconstructed in the 13th century, is also in the vicinity.

==Coinage==
Aspendos was one of the earliest cities to mint coins. It began issuing coinage around 500 BC, first staters and later drachmas; &quot;the slinger on the obverse represents the soldiery for which Aspendus was famous in antiquity,&quot; the reverse frequently depicts a triskelion. The legend appears on early coins as the abbreviation ΕΣ or ΕΣΤϜΕ; later coinage has ΕΣΤϜΕΔΙΙΥΣ, the adjective from the city&#x27;s local (Pamphylian) name Estwedus. The city&#x27;s numismatic history extends from archaic Greek to late Roman times.

== Bishopric ==

The Christian bishopric of Aspendus was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Side, the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia Prima, to which Aspendus belonged. Of its bishops, the names of four are recorded in extant documents: Domnus was at the First Council of Nicaea in 325, Tribonianus at the Council of Ephesus in 431, Timotheus at the 448 synod held by Flavian of Constantinople, which condemned Eutyches, and at the Robber Council of Ephesus held the same year, and Leo at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.

No longer a residential bishopric, Aspendus is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.

==Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival==

The theatre hosts the annual Aspendos International Opera and Ballet Festival organized by Turkish State Opera and Ballet since 1994, with international participation of opera and ballet companies and an audience of about 10,000.

Dalida held her last concert there on 28 April 1987.

<text>Northern Arizona University (NAU) is a public research university based in Flagstaff, Arizona, United States. Founded in 1899, it was the final university established in the Arizona Territory. 

It is one of the three universities governed by the Arizona Board of Regents and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. The university is divided into seven academic colleges offering about 130 undergraduate and graduate programs, and various academic certificates. Students can take classes and conduct research in Flagstaff, online, and at more than 20 statewide locations, including the Phoenix Biomedical Core research campus. As of fall 2023, 28,194 students were enrolled with 21,550 at the Flagstaff campus.

NAU is ranked No. 192 in the National Science Foundation (NSF) national research rankings for fiscal year 2023. NAU&#x27;s astronomy faculty led the observations of the NASA DART planetary defense mission, co-discovered several astronomical bodies such as Eris and Sedna, and are major participants in the search for the hypothetical Planet Nine. The university is a primary institution of the local Lowell Observatory. Alumni include 4 Truman Scholars, 11 Goldwater Scholars, and 3 Udall Scholars. 

The NAU Lumberjacks compete in the NCAA Division I primarily as part of the Big Sky Conference, and have won several national championships in cross country running. At an elevation of above sea level, the school&#x27;s athletic facilities are used by Olympic and professional athletes worldwide for prestige high altitude training.

==History==
===Creation and early history===
Initially named the Northern Arizona Normal School, the institution opened on September 11, 1899, with 23 students, two faculty members—one, Almon Nicholas Taylor, who was also the school president—and &quot;two copies of&quot; Webster&#x27;s International Dictionary&quot; bound in sheepskin&quot; as teaching resources. It was one of about 180 &quot;normal schools&quot; founded by state governments in the 19th century to train teachers for the rapidly growing public common schools. Some closed but most steadily expanded their role and became state colleges in the early 20th century and state universities in the late 20th century. 

The first graduating class, in 1901, consisted of four women who received credentials to teach in the Arizona Territory. In 1925, the Arizona State Legislature allowed the school, which was then called the Northern Arizona State Teachers College (ASTC), to grant bachelor of education degrees. In 1929, the school became Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff. Also in 1929, the Great Depression struck the nation, and the ASTC found new meaning in community outreach. Rather than collapsing, the school endured through the depression. In fact, Grady Gammage, the school president at the time, described higher education as &quot;a &#x27;depression industry&#x27; that fared well in hard times.&quot; Despite financial difficulties, enrollment increased from 321 students to 535 students between 1930 and 1940, and graduate work was introduced in 1937.

ASTC provided an education during economically trying times, often creating jobs to help students afford their education; they worked in the school-owned dairy farm, in the campus kitchen and dining hall, and as newspaper deliverers. The self-sufficiency of the college helped conserve monetary resources, and it was a major contributor to the local economy of the surrounding Flagstaff community, injecting almost a half-million dollars in 1938.

ASTC was known for its diverse student body and ethnic tolerance. In fact, the first Hopi to receive a college degree was Ida Mae Fredericks in 1939. Students came from rural farms, mining families, the East Coast, and points between. During the depression, fraternities and clubs sprang up, reflecting the diversity of backgrounds and interests.

===World War II impacts===
During World War II, NAU was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. Enrollment at the university dropped sharply at the beginning of World War II, dropping to 161 in 1945. However, the end of World War II brought increased enrollment as returning veterans continued their education.

The end of the war also expanded programs beyond teaching degrees, especially in the fields of art and science. To reflect this growth, the school changed its name to Arizona State College at Flagstaff in 1945 and, in 1958, became Arizona State College. Also in 1958, the world-renowned forestry program was started.

===Transition to Northern Arizona University===
With further growth over the next two decades, the Arizona Board of Regents granted Arizona State College university status as Northern Arizona University in 1966. The university received authorization to offer Doctors of Philosophy and Education in 1968, with the first doctoral candidates graduating in 1973.

In 2007, the business college was renamed The W. A. Franke College of Business, with entrepreneur Bill Franke as the namesake of the new business complex. 

===2015 shooting===

On October 9, 2015, Steven Edward Jones, an 18-year-old freshman at Northern Arizona University, shot four people, killing Colin Charles Brough and severely injuring three others, in a parking lot outside of Mountain View Hall on the Flagstaff Mountain campus.

Jones was charged with one count of first-degree murder and three counts of aggravated assault. He pleaded not guilty, taking responsibility for the shooting but saying that he acted in self-defense.

===2020s to present===
In 2022, José Luis Cruz Rivera became the university&#x27;s 17th president. In 2023, the university announced the establishment of NAU Health initiative, which will include the creation of a medical school through the College of Medicine.

==Campuses==
===Flagstaff campus===
Set across 829 forested acres, the Flagstaff campus houses academic, administrative and residential buildings.

At above sea level, NAU is the fourth highest-elevation four-year college campus in the country. The main campus is surrounded by the largest contiguous ponderosa pine forest in the world and enjoys a four-season climate, with the host city of Flagstaff averaging 90.1 inches of snow per year. Winter skiing is accessible at Arizona Snowbowl, which is an alpine ski resort located on the San Francisco Peaks, northwest of town, and the Grand Canyon and Sedona are short drives away. Flagstaff is regularly ranked among the best college towns in the United States.

For many years, the university has prioritized sustainability initiatives, and campus-wide programs and resources encourage the entire university community to get involved with sustainability efforts. There are more than a dozen LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)-certified buildings on campus and all new construction must meet strict LEED standards. Dining services and facilities contribute to a composting initiative, collecting more than 300,000 pounds of material each year, which prevents 250 metric tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Much of the campus uses renewable wind and solar technologies and the university is investigating opportunities to utilize the vast ponderosa pine forests around campus for biomass electricity or heat production. NAU President José Luis Cruz Rivera pledged carbon neutrality at NAU by 2030.

===Statewide campuses and NAU Online===

In addition to the more than 21,000 students who study on the Flagstaff campus, NAU currently serves another 8,000 students online and statewide. In order to provide access and affordability to all Arizona residents, NAU offers more than 130 accredited degree programs at more than 20 statewide locations. NAU also has partnerships with community colleges and NAU–Yavapai, a collaboration with Yavapai College in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The university&#x27;s oldest branch campus, and the largest, is NAU–Yuma.

NAU Online offers more than 140 fully-online options at all degree levels, including undergraduate and graduate degrees, certificates, and minors.

===Research===
Northern Arizona University is ranked No. 178 in the most recent National Science Foundation (NSF) national research rankings for fiscal year 2021 performance of $69.1 million. The research division&#x27;s core facilities are the Environmental Genetics and Genomics Resource Center, Imaging and Histology Core Facility, and the Research Greenhouse Complex. Other research laboratories include the Centennial Forest, Child Speech and Language Lab, Colorado Plateau Analytical Lab, Geospatial Research and Information Laboratory, Laboratory for Applied Social Research, Merriam-Powell Research Station, RAPIDLab, Southwest Experimental Garden Array, and Walnut Creek Center for Education and Research. 
The Pathogen and Microbiome Institute conducts research to track and fight a host of rapidly evolving and potentially deadly diseases including COVID-19. More than 100 faculty, full-time staff, graduate and undergraduate students work in the institute.
Collections, archives and museums include The Arboretum at Flagstaff, Art Museum, Cline Library Special Collections and Archives, Colorado Plateau Biodiversity Center, and the Museum of Northern Arizona.

Northern Arizona University joined the Lowell Discovery Telescope partner group in 2014. NAU scientists use the LDT for deep imaging of small objects in the solar system. Additionally, NAU partners with Lowell at its Anderson Mesa site, both in the National Undergraduate Research Laboratory and in a new Near-Earth Object follow-up program. NAU also manages the National Undergraduate Research Observatory, which provides access to Lowell&#x27;s 0.79-meter telescope for a consortium of four-year colleges around the country.

=== Rankings ===
The Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2021-2022 ranked NAU 501st-600th both internationally and nationally.

=== Admissions ===
In February 2022, NAU announced the Access2Excellence admissions pilot program. The goal is to increase Arizona high school students&#x27; access to college. Previously, NAU, like Arizona State University and the University of Arizona, required 16 core courses for assured admissions. However, not all Arizona high schools offer the 16 core courses, especially in second languages and math. NAU&#x27;s pilot program removed the second language course availability barrier and will accept more fourth-year math courses, allowing more students the opportunity to pursue a postsecondary education.

Fall first-year student statistics
== Tuition and fees ==
The average cost of tuition and fees for a full-time, Arizona resident undergraduate student for the 2023–24 school year is $12,652 and $28,900 for out-of-state undergraduates. NAU also participates in the Western Undergraduate Exchange Program, which offers lower tuition rates for students from the Western United States. For 2023–24, WUE tuition and fees are $18,328. NAU is also part of two programs, the Western Regional Graduate program and the Professional Student Exchange Program, that allow approved graduate students from other Western states to pay in-state tuition.

NAU&#x27;s Access2Excellence (A2E) initiative, announced in April 2022 by President José Luis Cruz Rivera, will provide a tuition-free undergraduate college education for every Arizona resident with a household income of $65,000 or below, assuring tuition will be fully covered by scholarships and financial aid. A2E also covers the cost of tuition for members of 22 federally recognized Arizona tribes, regardless of income or residency. Approximately 50 percent of Arizona households currently meet this financial threshold. 

== Native American initiatives ==

Part of the NAU 2025 Elevating Excellence strategic roadmap is to be &quot;the nation&#x27;s leading university serving Indigenous Peoples.&quot; Many programs on and off campus have been established in support of this goal.

The Native American Cultural Center is a 12,000-square-foot facility that houses many programs built to support Indigenous students and functions as a social and cultural hub. The Office of Native American Initiatives supports students and Indigenous communities with programs including the Institute for Native-serving Educators, the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals, the Tribal Leadership Initiative, and the Office of Indigenous Student Success.

== Martin-Springer Institute ==
The Martin-Springer Institute was founded at NAU in 2000 to &quot;raise awareness of human rights through Holocaust remembrance and education.&quot; The institute was founded by Holocaust survivor Doris Martin and her husband Ralph Martin. The institute, headed by Director Björn Krondorfer, hosts speakers, academic workshops, and symposia; mounts public exhibitions; funds research; and provides educational workshops and study tours for Arizona teachers.

==Residence halls==
NAU houses nearly 10,500 students on campus.

===First-year residence halls===
Available freshman halls include Allen Hall, Campbell Hall, Cowden Hall, Honors College, McConnell Hall, Morton Hall, Reilly Hall, Sechrist Hall (a nine-story residence hall, the tallest building in northern Arizona), Taylor Hall, Tinsley Hall, and Wilson Hall.

== Athletics ==
Student-athletes compete at the intervarsity level in football (men); volleyball, soccer, golf, and swimming and diving (women); and basketball, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field, and tennis (men and women). The university participates in 15 intercollegiate sports programs. Several of NAU&#x27;s teams compete at the Walkup Skydome, a multipurpose stadium providing facilities for football, basketball, indoor track and field, soccer, weight lifting, lacrosse, student recreation, major concert events, commencements, intramurals, and a variety of other university and community activities.

The $47 million, 77,000 square-foot Student-Athlete High Performance Center opened in February 2022. The facility includes a 10,000-square-foot weight room, an academic center, basketball courts, an adjacent practice field, locker rooms, team meeting rooms, an auditorium, and sports-medicine spaces.
The Rolle Activity Center provides physical education classrooms and contains courts for recreational and varsity sports, including NAU&#x27;s volleyball team, with seating for almost 1,100. The building was named after Joseph C. Rolle, “Mr. Lumberjack,” in 1989. Rolle played basketball from 1937 to 1941, served as student body president, and received a BA in 1941 and MA in education in 1950 from Arizona State College of Flagstaff. He later earned an EdS from Columbia University and then worked at NAU for 36 years in positions ranging from bookstore manager to dean of students and dean of university services.

The Wall Aquatic Center in the Aquatic and Tennis Complex is one of the finest high-altitude swimming facilities in the world.

The Lumberjacks compete at the NCAA Division I level in all sports. In football, the Lumberjacks compete at the Football Championship Subdivision level (formerly known as Division I-AA). NAU competes in the Big Sky Conference in all sports except swimming and diving, which are part of the Western Athletic Conference.

The Lumberjacks won the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Cross Country Championship in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2021, and 2022. The 2017 repeat title closed out a perfect season with a 53-point victory, placing five athletes in the top 40. The victory was the lowest score (74) at the NCAA Championships since 2014, and the Lumberjacks became the first repeat champions since 2013–14. Director of Cross Country and Track and Field Michael Smith earned the Bill Dellinger Award as National Men&#x27;s Coach of the Year and also picked up both the Big Sky&#x27;s Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Coach of the Year awards. In track and field, Smith was named the US Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association (USTFCCCA) Mountain Region Women&#x27;s Indoor Coach of the Year in 2017 and 2018.

Maya Calé-Benzoor of Israel set the school outdoor long jump record at 20&#x27; 6&quot; (6.10 m), NAU records in both the women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor long (20&#x27; 6&quot;.00) and triple jumps (41&#x27; 3&quot;.75), and 40&#x27; 5&quot;.00 in the indoor triple jump. She was an NCAA All American in 1984. In 1989 she was inducted into the NAU Athletic Hall of Fame.

Because of its high elevation, NAU&#x27;s facilities are sometimes used for altitude training by endurance athletes.

<text>Mahim (, ) is a neighbourhood in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The Mahim Junction railway station on the Western Railway and Harbour Railway of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network is the last station of the city, as neighboring Bandra comes in Mumbai Suburb. Mahim is an ethnically and religiously diverse town and has a Hindu temple, church, mosque and Parsi fire-temple existing within a few meters of each other. The town has a large Rich and Upper Middle class Marathi population, as well as Sindhi population.

== History ==

The name Mahim is derived from the ancient &quot;Mahikavati&quot; meaning &quot;miraculous&quot; in Sanskrit. Other historical names for the area include &quot;Mahimawati,&quot; &quot;Maijim&quot;, and &quot;Mejambu&quot;.

Mahim was one of the seven islands that originally made up Mumbai. Mahim, or Mahikavati as it was known, was the capital of Raja Bhimdev, who reigned over the region in the 13th century. He built a palace and a court of justice in Prabhadevi, as well as the first Babulnath Temple.
In 1343, this island was possessed by the Delhi Sultanate. It was in their reign that the old Mahim mosque was built. A dargah of Makhdoom Ali Mahimi was built here in 1431.

In 1543, the Portuguese captured the islands of Mumbai. In 1662, these islands were given to the English King, King Charles II, as a part of the wedding dowry for the Portuguese princess, Catherine of Braganza. After the British acquired Mumbai, they built the Mahim Fort here to protect themselves from the Marathas.

The causeway connecting Mahim and Bandra (corrupted from &quot;Bunder&quot; meaning port in Persian) was completed in 1845 at a cost of Rs. 1,57,000 donated entirely by Lady Avabai Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, wife of the first baronet Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy with a stipulation that no toll would be charged to citizens for its use by the government.

In 1847, a small group of Scottish missionaries decided to start a new school, now one of the most high-profile schools in Mumbai — the Bombay Scottish School.

The 1993 Bombay bombings took place in Mahim among other places. A truck driver placed a vehicle here and put a bomb there which exploded.

The town is also in close proximity to the remarkable Maharashtra Nature Park. This park has been created out of a garbage dump, and houses a bird sanctuary. It houses 12,500 varieties of plants and several rare birds including flamingos.

=== Mahim Fort ===

Mahim Fort, which was once visible from the Mahim Causeway and Bandra Reclamation, is barely visible now. The Mahim Fort along with Fort St George in South Mumbai was an important base during the time of the British Empire. Other forts in Mumbai and Salsette Island include Sion, Worli, Sewri and Mazagaon. Fort St George was built in 1669, by the former Governor of Bombay, Gerald Aungier.

Thomas Grantham then strengthened the fort&#x27;s ramparts in 1684. In 1772, 111 years after Bombay was taken from them, the Portuguese attempted to attack this fort. The British replied fiercely with cannonballs. The Bandra church also bore the brunt of their fire. There were about 100 soldiers and 30 cannons in the Mahim Fort at that time.

The fort is situated just beside Mahim beach. Today the fort is almost ruined and encroachers and hutments occupy it.

==Demographics==

The town has a large and strong base of upper middle class and rich Marathi people and is also home to several Marathi actors. The largest ethnic minority group being Goans (Portuguese descent) followed by South Indians (mostly from Karnataka, Kerala and Tamilnadu). Mahim is also home to a significant number of Gujaratis, Bengalis and Sindhis. Hinduism is the most followed religion while Christianity and Islam are the second and third most followed religions respectively. There is also a small community of Parsis (Zorastrians) Buddhists and Jains residing in Mahim. Mahim is considered to be Mumbai&#x27;s ethnically, religiously and linguistically most diverse town.

== Geography ==

Mahim is surrounded by the Arabian Sea to the west, Bandra to the North, Matunga (West) and Dadar to South and by and Sion to the east.

=== Mahim Bay ===
Mahim Bay is a large bay, part of the Arabian Sea in Mumbai. The southern end is Worli, the northern end is Bandra Reclamation and Mahim is in the centre. The bay was named after the islands of Mahim and Salsette were merged in the early 19th century. The Mithi River drains into Mahim Creek.

During the colonial era, the Portuguese built a watchtower called Castella de Aguada on the northern side. Later, the British built the Worli Fort to the south and Mahim Fort near the creek to defend the Seven Islands of Bombay against attacks by the Portuguese and the Marathas. The Bandra–Worli Sea Link crosses Mahim Bay.

=== Mahimchi Khadi (Mahim Creek) ===

Mahim Creek is a deep creek. The Mithi River drains into the creek which drains into the Mahim Bay. It forms the boundary between the city (Churchgate to Mahim) and suburbs (Bandra to Dahisar) of Mumbai. The creek is swamped by mangroves and has a mini-ecosystem.

It now has the Bandra Kurla Complex with corporate offices on both its sides.

The waters of the creek are foul smelling due to the dumping of untreated industrial effluents upstream. In recent years, the mushrooming of slums around the waters has caused concern for the mangrove ecosystem, vital to the ecosystem of Mumbai.

In 2006, it was the site of mass hysteria as thousands claimed its waters had turned &quot;sweet.&quot;

==Transport==

The nearest railway station is Mahim Junction on the Western line and Harbour Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. The station is an important Junction as it connects Western Suburbs (till Goregaon) with Harbour line (CSMT to Kings Circle). Taxis and buses are widely used by the locals and auto rickshaws are not allowed. The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport is just 4 kilometers away from the town.

=== Mahim Causeway ===

The Mahim Causeway is a vital link road connecting the neighborhoods of Mahim in Mumbai City district to Bandra in Mumbai Suburban district.

The Mahim Causeway was built between 1841 and 1846 to connect the island of Salsette with Mahim. The swampy area between the two islands made travel dangerous and thus a need for a causeway arose. The British East India Company, which governed Bombay at that time, refused to fund the project. This led Lady Jeejeebhoy, wife of the first baronet Sir Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, to donate the entire amount of 157,000/- on the condition that the government would not charge a toll for its use or disturb the Koli community who lived around the area.

The Mahim Causeway forms the link between Swami Vivekanand Road and L.J. Road, being the stretch between Bandra Masjid and Mahim Church (St. Michael&#x27;s Church). It is not to be confused with the Bandra–Worli Sea Link, a major infrastructural project opened on 30 June 2009 which is designed to ease traffic across the causeway by building another bridge across the Mahim Bay.

== Schools and educational institutions ==
Mahim has a number of schools and educational institutions. Some of the well-known schools are Bombay Scottish School, Canossa Convent High School, K.J Khilnani High School, Victoria High School, Saraswati Mandir High School, Lokmanya Vidyamandir, Billa Bong school and St Michael High School). Reputed colleges and professional educational institutes such as P. D. Hinduja National Hospital and Medical Research Centre, St. Xavier&#x27;s Technical Institute and Xavier Institute of Engineering also in Mahim.

<text>Hebrew cantillation, trope, trop, or te&#x27;amim is the manner of chanting ritual readings from the Hebrew Bible in synagogue services. The chants are written and notated in accordance with the special signs or marks printed in the Masoretic Text of the Bible, to complement the letters and vowel points.

These marks are known in English as &#x27;accents&#x27; (diacritics), &#x27;notes&#x27; or trope symbols, and in Hebrew as () or just (). Some of these signs were also sometimes used in medieval manuscripts of the Mishnah. The musical motifs associated with the signs are known in Hebrew as or (not to be confused with Hasidic nigun) and in Yiddish as  (): the word &quot;trope&quot; is sometimes used in Jewish English with the same meaning.

There are multiple traditions of cantillation. Within each tradition, there are multiple tropes, typically for different books of the Bible and often for different occasions. For example, different chants may be used for Torah readings on Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur than for the same text on a normal Shabbat.

== History ==
Three systems of Hebrew punctuation (including vowels and cantillation symbols) have been used: the Babylonian, the Jerusalem, and the Tiberian, only the last of which is used today.

===Babylonian system===

Babylonian Biblical manuscripts from the Geonic period contain no cantillation marks in the current sense, but small Hebrew letters are used to mark significant divisions within a verse. Up to eight different letters are found, depending on the importance of the break and where it occurs in the verse: these correspond roughly to the disjunctives of the Tiberian system. For example, in some manuscripts the letter &quot;tav&quot;, for &quot;tevir&quot; (break), does duty for both Tiberian &quot;tevir&quot; and &quot;zaqef&quot;. In general there are no symbols for the conjunctives, though some late manuscripts use the Tiberian symbols for these. There is also no equivalent for low-grade disjunctives such as &quot;telisha gedolah&quot;: these are generally replaced by the equivalent of &quot;zaqef&quot; or &quot;revia&quot;.

Nothing is known of the musical realization of these marks, but it seems likely that they represent breaks or variations in a set melody applied to each verse. (A somewhat similar system is used in manuscripts of the Qur&#x27;an to guide the reader in fitting the chant to the verse: see &quot;Qur&#x27;an reading&quot;.)

This system is reflected in the cantillation practices of the Yemenite Jews, who now use the Tiberian symbols, but tend to have musical motifs only for the disjunctives and render the conjunctives in a monotone. It is notable that the Yemenite Jews have only eight disjunctive motifs, thus clearly reflecting the Babylonian notation. The same is true of the Karaite mode for the haftarah; while in the Sephardi haftarah modes different disjunctives often have the same or closely similar motifs, reducing the total number of effective motifs to something like the same number.

=== Jerusalem system ===

The Babylonian system, as mentioned above, is mainly concerned with showing breaks in the verse. Early manuscripts from Judaea and Galilee, by contrast, are mainly concerned with showing phrases: for example the &quot;tifcha-etnachta&quot;, &quot;zarqa-segolta&quot; and &quot;pashta-zaqef&quot; sequences, with or without intervening unaccented words. These sequences are generally linked by a series of dots, beginning or ending with a dash or a dot in a different place to show which sequence is meant. Unaccented words (which in the Tiberian system carry conjunctives) are generally shown by a dot following the word, as if to link it to the following word. There are separate symbols for more elaborate tropes like &quot;pazer&quot; and &quot;telisha gedolah&quot;.

The manuscripts are extremely fragmentary, no two of them following quite the same conventions, and these marks may represent the individual reader&#x27;s aide-memoire rather than a formal system of punctuation (for example, vowel signs are often used only where the word would otherwise be ambiguous). In one manuscript, presumably of somewhat later date than the others, there are separate marks for different conjunctives, actually outnumbering those in the Tiberian system (for example, &quot;munach&quot; before &quot;etnachta&quot; has a different sign from &quot;munach&quot; before &quot;zaqef&quot;), and the overall system approaches the Tiberian in comprehensiveness. In some other manuscripts, in particular those containing Targumim rather than original text, the Tiberian symbols have been added by a later hand. In general, it may be observed that the Jerusalem and Tiberian systems are far more closely related to each other than either is to the Babylonian.

This system of phrasing is reflected in the Sephardic cantillation modes, in which the conjunctives (and to some extent the &quot;near companions&quot; such as &quot;tifcha&quot;, &quot;pashta&quot; and &quot;zarqa&quot;) are rendered as flourishes leading into the motif of the following disjunctive rather than as motifs in their own right.

The somewhat inconsistent use of dots above and below the words as disjunctives is closely similar to that found in Syriac texts. Kahle also notes some similarity with the punctuation of Samaritan Hebrew.

=== Tiberian system ===

By the tenth century CE, the chant in use in medieval Palestine had clearly become more complex, both because of the existence of &quot;pazer&quot;, &quot;geresh&quot; and &quot;telisha&quot; motifs in longer verses and because the realization of a phrase ending with a given type of break varied according to the number of words and syllables in the phrase. The Tiberian Masoretes therefore developed a comprehensive notation with a symbol on each word, to replace the fragmentary systems previously in use. In particular, it was necessary to invent a range of different conjunctive accents to show how to introduce and elaborate the main motif in longer phrases. (For example, &quot;tevir&quot; is preceded by &quot;mercha&quot;, a short flourish, in shorter phrases but by &quot;darga&quot;, a more elaborate run of notes, in longer phrases.) The system they devised is the one in use today, and is found in Biblical manuscripts such as the Aleppo Codex. A Masoretic treatise called &quot;Diqduqe ha-teʿamim&quot; (precise rules of the accents) by Aaron ben Moses ben Asher survives, though both the names and the classification of the accents differ somewhat from those of the present day.

As the accents were (and are) not shown on a Torah scroll, it was found necessary to have a person making hand signals to the reader to show the tune, as in the Byzantine system of neumes. This system of cheironomy survives in some communities to the present day, notably in Italy. It is speculated that both the shapes and the names of some of the accents (e.g. &quot;tifcha&quot;, literally &quot;hand-breadth&quot;) may refer to the hand signals rather than to the syntactical functions or melodies denoted by them. Today in most communities there is no system of hand signals and the reader learns the melody of each reading in advance.

The Tiberian system spread quickly and was accepted in all communities by the 13th century. Each community re-interpreted its reading tradition so as to allocate one short musical motif to each symbol: this process has gone furthest in the Western Ashkenazi and Ottoman (Jerusalem-Sephardi, Syrian etc.) traditions. Learning the accents and their musical rendition is now an important part of the preparations for a bar mitzvah, as this is the first occasion on which a person reads from the Torah in public.

In the early period of the Reform movement there was a move to abandon the system of cantillation and give Scriptural readings in normal speech (in Hebrew or in the vernacular). In recent decades, however, traditional cantillation has been restored in many communities.

===Different systems for different sets of books===
There are two systems of cantillation marks in the Tanakh. One is used in the twenty-one prose books, while the other appears in the three poetical books of Psalms, Proverbs and Job. Except where otherwise stated, this article describes the &quot;prose&quot; system.

==Traditional roots==
The current system of cantillation notes has its historical roots in the Tiberian masorah. The cantillation signs are included in Unicode as characters U+0591 through U+05AF in the Hebrew block.

===Different naming according to rites===
The names of some of the cantillation signs differ in the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Italian and Yemenite traditions; for example Sephardim use &quot;qadma&quot; to mean what Ashkenazim call &quot;pashta&quot;, and &quot;azla&quot; to mean what Ashkenazim call &quot;qadma&quot;. In this article, as in almost all Hebrew grammars, the Ashkenazi terminology is used. The names in other traditions are shown in the table below.

==Purpose==

===Synagogue use===
A primary purpose of the cantillation signs is to guide the chanting of the sacred texts during public worship. Very roughly speaking, each word of text has a cantillation mark at its primary accent and associated with that mark is a musical phrase that tells how to sing that word. The reality is more complex, with some words having two or no marks and the musical meaning of some marks dependent upon context. There are different sets of musical phrases associated with different sections of the Bible. The music varies with different Jewish traditions and individual cantorial styles.

===Explanation to text===
The cantillation signs also provide information on the syntactical structure of the text and some say they are a commentary on the text itself, highlighting important ideas musically. The tropes are not random strings but follow a set and describable grammar. The very word &quot;ta&#x27;am&quot;, used in Hebrew to refer to the cantillation marks, literally means &quot;taste&quot; or &quot;sense&quot;, the point being that the pauses and intonation denoted by the accents (with or without formal musical rendition) bring out the sense of the passage.

==Functions of cantillation signs in explanation of text==

The cantillation signs serve three functions:

===Syntax===
In general, each word in the Tanakh has one cantillation sign. This may be either a &quot;disjunctive&quot;, showing a division between that and the following word, or a &quot;conjunctive&quot;, joining the two words (like a slur in music). Thus, disjunctives divide a verse into phrases, and within each phrase all the words except the last carry conjunctives. (There are two types of exception to the rule about words having only one sign. A group of words joined by hyphens is regarded as one word so they only have one accent between them. Conversely, a long word may have two—e.g., a disjunctive on the stressed syllable and the related conjunctive two syllables before in place of &quot;meteg&quot;.)

The disjunctives are traditionally divided into four levels, with lower level disjunctives marking less important breaks.

#The first level, known as &quot;Emperors&quot;, includes &quot;sof pasuk&quot; / &quot;siluk&quot;, marking the end of the verse, and &quot;atnach&quot; / &quot;etnachta&quot;, marking the middle.
#The second level is known as &quot;Kings&quot;. The usual second level disjunctive is &quot;zakef qatan&quot; (when on its own, this becomes &quot;zakef gadol&quot;). This is replaced by &quot;tifcha&quot; when in the immediate neighborhood of &quot;sof pasuk&quot; or &quot;atnach&quot;. A stronger second level disjunctive, used in very long verses, is &quot;segol&quot;: when it occurs on its own, this may be replaced by &quot;shalshelet&quot;.
#The third level is known as &quot;Dukes&quot;. The usual third level disjunctive is &quot;revia&quot;. For musical reasons, this is replaced by &quot;zarka&quot; when in the vicinity of &quot;segol&quot;, by &quot;pashta&quot; or &quot;yetiv&quot; when in the vicinity of &quot;zakef&quot;, and by &quot;tevir&quot; when in the vicinity of &quot;tifcha&quot;.
#The fourth level is known as &quot;Counts&quot;. These are found mainly in longer verses, and tend to cluster near the beginning of a half-verse: for this reason their musical realisation is usually more elaborate than that of higher level disjunctives. They are &quot;pazer&quot;, &quot;geresh&quot;, &quot;gershayim&quot;, &quot;telisha gedola&quot;, and &quot;qarne farah&quot;.

The general conjunctive is &quot;munach&quot;. Depending on which disjunctive follows, this may be replaced by &quot;mercha&quot;, &quot;mahpach&quot;, &quot;darga&quot;, &quot;qadma&quot;, or &quot;yerach ben yomo&quot;.

One other symbol is &quot;mercha kefulah&quot;, double mercha. There is some argument about whether this is another conjunctive or an occasional replacement for &quot;tevir&quot;.

Disjunctives have a function somewhat similar to punctuation in Western languages. &quot;Sof pasuk&quot; could be thought of as a full stop, &quot;atnach&quot; as a semi-colon, second level disjunctives as commas and third level disjunctives as commas or unmarked. Where two words are written in the construct state (for example, &quot;pene ha-mayim&quot;, &quot;the face of the waters&quot;), the first noun (&quot;nomen regens&quot;) invariably carries a conjunctive.

The cantillation signs are often an important aid in the interpretation of a passage. For example, the words &quot;qol qore bamidbar panu derekh YHWH&quot; (Isaiah 40:3) is translated in the Authorised Version as &quot;The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD&quot;. As the word &quot;qore&quot; takes the high-level disjunctive &quot;zakef katon&quot; this meaning is discouraged by the cantillation marks. Accordingly, the New Revised Standard Version translates &quot;A voice cries out: &#x27;In the wilderness prepare the way of the , ...&#x27;&quot; while the New Jewish Publication Society Version has &quot;A voice rings out: &#x27;Clear in the desert a road for the &#x27;.&quot;

===Phonetics===
Most cantillation signs are written on the consonant of the stressed syllable of a word. This also shows where the most important note of the musical motif should go.

A few signs always go on the first or last consonant of a word. This may have been for musical reasons, or it may be to distinguish them from other accents of similar shape. For example, &quot;pashta&quot;, which goes on the last consonant, otherwise looks like &quot;kadma&quot;, which goes on the stressed syllable.

Some signs are written (and sung) differently when the word is not stressed on its last syllable. &quot;Pashta&quot; on a word of this kind is doubled, one going on the stressed syllable and the other on the last consonant. &quot;Geresh&quot; is doubled unless it occurs on a non-finally-stressed word or follows &quot;kadma&quot; (to form the &quot;kadma ve-azla&quot; phrase).

===Music===
Cantillation signs guide the reader in applying a chant to Biblical readings. This chant is technically regarded as a ritualized form of speech intonation rather than as a musical exercise like the singing of metrical hymns: for this reason Jews always speak of &quot;saying&quot; or &quot;reading&quot; a passage rather than of &quot;singing&quot; it. (In Yiddish the word is &quot;leynen&quot; &#x27;read&#x27;, derived from Latin &quot;legere&quot;, giving rise to the Jewish English verb &quot;to leyn&quot;.)

The musical value of the cantillation signs serves the same function for Jews worldwide, but the specific tunes vary between different communities. The most common tunes today are as follows.

*Among Ashkenazi Jews:
**The Polish-Lithuanian melody, used by Ashkenazic descendants of eastern European Jews, is the most common tune in the world today, both in Israel and the diaspora.
**The Ashkenazic melodies from central and western European Jewry are used far less today than before the Holocaust, but still survive in some communities, especially in Great Britain. They are of interest because a very similar melody was notated by Johann Reuchlin as in use in Germany in his day (15th–16th century).
**The melody used by Ashkenazic Jews in Italy.
*Among Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews:
**The &quot;Jerusalem Sephardic&quot; (&quot;Sepharadi-Yerushalmi&quot;) melody is now the most widely used Sephardic melody in Israel, and is also used in some Sephardic communities in the diaspora.
**The Greek/Turkish/Balkan, Syrian and Egyptian melodies are related to the Jerusalem Sephardic melody. They are more sparsely used in Israel today, but are still heard in the Diaspora, especially in America.
**There are two Iraqi melodies, one close to the Syrian melody and traditionally used in Baghdad (and sometimes in Israel), and another more distinctive melody originating in Mosul and generally used in the Iraqi Jewish diaspora, especially in India.
**The Moroccan melody is used widely by Jews of Moroccan descent, both in Israel and in the diaspora, especially France. It subdivides into a Spanish-Moroccan melody, used in the northern coastal strip, and an Arab-Moroccan melody, used in the interior of the country, with some local variations. The Algerian, Tunisian and Libyan melodies are somewhat similar, and may be regarded as intermediate between the Moroccan and &quot;Jerusalem Sephardic&quot; melodies. 
**The Spanish and Portuguese melody is in common use in the Spanish and Portuguese Sephardi communities of Livorno, Gibraltar, the Netherlands, England, Canada, the United States and other places in the Americas. It is closely related to the Spanish-Moroccan melody and has some resemblance to the Iraqi (Mosul and diaspora) melody.
*Italian melodies are still used in Italy, as well as in two Italian minyanim in Jerusalem and one in Netanya. These vary greatly locally: for example the melody used in Rome resembles the Spanish and Portuguese melody rather than those used in northern Italy.
*Romaniote style of cantillation is used today in Greece, Israel, and New York and is rooted in the Byzantine tradition
*The Yemenite melody can be heard in Israel primarily, but also in some American cities.
*There is also a Persian Jewish melody for the Torah and a very distinct melody for the Haftarah.

====Reconstructed melody====
There has been an attempted reconstruction of the original melody by Suzanne Haïk-Vantoura, on the basis of the shapes and positions of the marks and without any reference to existing melodies, as described in her book &quot;La musique de la Bible révélée&quot; and her records. That reconstruction assumes the signs represent the degrees of various musical scales, that is individual notes, which puts it at odds with all existing traditions where the signs invariably represent melodic motives. Some musicologists have rejected her results as dubious and her methodology as flawed. A similar reconstructive proposal was developed by American composer and pianist and posthumously published in 2011.

==Traditional melodies==

===Ashkenazic melodies===

In the Ashkenazic musical tradition for Te&#x27;raim, each of the local geographical customs includes a total of &quot;six&quot; major and numerous minor separate melodies for Tera&#x27;im:
*Torah and Haftarot (3 melodies)
*# Torah (general melody for the whole year) 
*# Torah – special melody for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. This tune is also employed on Simhat Torah in various degrees (depending on the specific community). Echoes of it can also be heard for certain verses in the Torah reading for fast days in some communities.
*#*There are a number of variants employed for special sections, such as those for the &quot;Aseret haDibrot&quot; (Ten Commandments), &quot;Az Yashir&quot; (Song of the Sea), and the list of Masa&#x27;ot.
*#*In all Torah modes, there is a &quot;coda&quot; motif that is used for the last few words of each reading.
*#*There is a special coda used at the end of each of the five books of the Torah that leads to the traditional exclamation of &quot;Hazak Hazak V&#x27;Nithazek!&quot; (Be strong, be strong so we are strengthened!).
*# Haftarot 
*#*In the haftarah mode, there is also a &quot;coda&quot; motif. In the Western Ashkenazic mode, this is applied to the end of every verse. A different coda is used at the end of the haftarah among both Eastern and Western Ashkenazim, modulating from minor to major to introduce the following blessing.
*#*This is also the tune that is applied when reading the non-haftarah portions of the books of the Prophets and the latter Writings (Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles), although this usage is largely theoretical, as these are not subject to public reading as the other sections and books are.
*The Five Megillot (3 melodies are employed for these five scrolls)

The Ashkenazic tradition preserves no melody for the special cantillation notes of Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, which were not publicly read in the synagogue by European Jews. However, the Ashkenazic yeshiva known as Aderet Eliyahu, or (more informally) &quot;Zilberman&#x27;s&quot;, in the Old City of Jerusalem, uses an adaptation of the Syrian cantillation-melody for these books, and this is becoming more popular among other Ashkenazim as well.

===Sephardic and Eastern melodies===

At the beginning of the twentieth century there was a single Ottoman-Sephardic tradition (no doubt with local variations) covering Turkey, Syria, Israel and Egypt. Today the Jerusalem-Sephardic, Syrian, Egyptian and Baghdadi melodies recognisably belong to a single family. For example, in these traditions the Torah reading is always or almost always in Maqam Sigah. There are some variations, among individual readers as well as among communities: for example the Egyptian melody is related to the more elaborate and cantorial form of the Syrian melody and was transitioning toward Maqam Huzzam before the mass expulsion in 1950. The Karaite tradition, being based on the Egyptian, also forms part of this group.

Another recognisable family consists of the Iraqi (Mosul and Iraqi diaspora), Spanish-Moroccan and Spanish and Portuguese melodies. The probable reason for the occurrence of similar melodies at opposite ends of the Arab world is that they represent the remains of an old Arab-Jewish tradition not overlaid by the later Ottoman-Sephardic tradition that spread to the countries in between. There may also have been some convergence between the London Spanish and Portuguese and Iraqi melodies during British rule in India and the British Mandate of Mesopotamia.

The Jews of North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Yemen all had local musical traditions for cantillation. When these Jewish communities emigrated (mostly to Israel) during the twentieth century, they brought their musical traditions with them. But as the immigrants themselves grew older, many particular national melodies began to be forgotten, or to become assimilated into the &quot;Jerusalem Sephardic&quot; melting-pot.

As with the Ashkenazim, there is one tune for Torah readings and a different tune for haftarot. Spanish and Portuguese Jews have a special tune for the Ten Commandments when read according to the &quot;ta&#x27;am elyon&quot;, known as &quot;High Na&#x27;um&quot;, which is also used for some other words and passages which it is desired to emphasize. Other communities, such as the Syrian Jews, observe the differences between the two sets of cantillation marks for the Ten Commandments but have no special melody for &quot;ta&#x27;am &#x27;elyon&quot;. There is no special tune for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in any Sephardic tradition. As with Ashkenazim, the normal musical value of cantillation signs is replaced by a &quot;coda&quot; motif at the end of each Torah reading and of each haftarah verse (though there is no special coda for the end of the haftarah), suggesting a common origin for the Sephardi and Ashkenazi chants.

Eastern Jewish communities have no liturgical tradition of reading Ecclesiastes, and there is no public liturgical reading of Song of Songs on Passover, though brief extracts may be read after the morning service during the first half of Nisan. (Individuals may read it after the Passover Seder, and many communities recite it every Friday night.) There are specialized tunes for Song of Songs, Ruth, Esther and Lamentations. The prose passages at the beginning and end of the book of Job may be read either to the tune of Song of Songs or to that of Ruth, depending on the community. The Ruth tune is generally the &quot;default&quot; tune for any book of the Ketuvim (Hagiographa) that does not have a tune of its own.

Unlike the Ashkenazic tradition, the eastern traditions, in particular that of the Syrian Jews, include melodies for the special cantillation of Psalms, Proverbs and the poetic parts of Job. In many eastern communities, Proverbs is read on the six Sabbaths between Passover and Shavuot, Job on the Ninth of Av, and Psalms are read on a great many occasions. The cantillation melody for Psalms can also vary depending on the occasion. The Spanish and Portuguese Jews have no tradition for the rendering of the Psalms according to the cantillation marks, but the melody used for several psalms in the evening service is noticeably similar to that of Syrian psalm cantillation, and may represent the remnants of such a tradition.

===Yemenite melodies===
Yemenite cantillation has a total of eight distinctive motifs, falling within four main patterns:
* (&#x27;moving&#x27;) used for the conjunctives and some minor disjunctives
* (&#x27;pausing&#x27;) for most third level disjunctives
* (&#x27;elongating&#x27;) for most second level disjunctives; and
*the patterns of &quot;etnaḥa&quot; and &quot;silluq&quot; (&quot;sof pasuk&quot;).

This is true equally of the system used for the Torah and the systems used for the other books. It appears to be a relic of the Babylonian system, which also recognised only eight types of disjunctive and no conjunctives.

===Learning melodies===

Some communities had a simplified melody for the Torah, used in teaching it to children, as distinct from the mode used in synagogue. (This should not be confused with the &quot;lernen steiger&quot; used for studying the Mishnah and Talmud.) For example, the Yemenite community teaches a simplified melody for children, to be used both in school and when they are called to read the sixth aliyah. The simplified melody is also used for the reading of the Targum, which is generally performed by a young boy.

Conversely, the Syrian community knows two types of Torah cantillation, a simpler one for general use and a more elaborate one used by professional hazzanim. It is probable that the simpler melody was originally a teaching mode. Today, however, it is the mode in general use, and is also an ancestor of the &quot;Jerusalem-Sephardic&quot; melody.

Some communities, such as the Portuguese community of Amsterdam, have a simplified melody for the Prophets for study purposes, distinct from that used in reading the Haftarah: the distinction is mentioned in one medieval Sephardic source.

==Names and shapes of the te&#x27;amim==

===Names in different traditions===

The following table shows the names of the te&#x27;amim in the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Italian traditions together with their Unicode symbols.
* Cantillation marks are rarely supported in many default Hebrew fonts. They should display, however, on Windows with one of these fonts installed by default in Microsoft Office:
*: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, &quot;Arial&quot;, &quot;Gisha&quot;, &quot;Microsoft Sans Serif&quot;, &quot;Courier New&quot;
* Additional fonts with support for cantillation marks can be found at the Culmus project in the Taamey Culmus section, which includes the following fonts:
*: &quot;Taamey Frank CLM&quot;, &quot;Taamey Ashkenaz&quot;, &quot;Shofar&quot;, &quot;Taamey David CLM&quot;, &quot;Keter Aram Tsova&quot;, &quot;Keter YG&quot;
* Some further fonts with support for cantillation marks include:
*: &quot;Cardo&quot;, &quot;Ezra SIL&quot;, &quot;SBL BibLit&quot;, &quot;SBL Hebrew&quot;, &quot;Taamey D&quot;, &quot;Code2000&quot;
* The following default Hebrew fonts do not display these marks:
*: &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Miriam&quot;, &quot;Rod&quot;, &quot;FrankRuehl&quot; (as well as &quot;serif&quot;, &quot;sans-serif&quot;, &quot;monospaced&quot; unless they are configured manually)
* The mark for U+05AA (&quot;yerach ben yomo&quot; or &quot;galgal&quot;) should not be drawn with the bottom vertical tick used in the mark drawn for U+05A2 (&quot;atnach hafukh&quot;); however, some fonts draw these marks identically.

The following additional symbols are found in the three poetical books; their names do not differ among the various traditions.

===&quot;Zarqa&quot; tables===

For learning purposes, the &quot;t&#x27;amim&quot; are arranged in a traditional order of recitation called a &quot;&quot;zarqa&quot; table&quot;, showing both the names and the symbols themselves. These tables are often printed at the end of a Chumash (Hebrew Pentateuch).

The order of recitation bears some relation to the groups in which the signs are likely to occur in a typical Biblical verse, but differs in detail between different communities. Below are traditional Ashkenazi and Sephardi orders, though variations are found in both communities.

====Ashkenazic====
====Sephardic====
===Meanings of the names===
;Azla:&quot;Going away&quot;, because it is often the end of the phrase &#x27;Qadma ve&#x27;Azla&#x27; (lit. &quot;go forward and depart&quot;, &quot;start and leave&quot;, perhaps for its sound).
;Darga:&quot;stairstep&quot; from its shape or sound.
;Etnaḥta/Atnaḥ:&quot;Pause&quot;, &quot;rest&quot;, because it is the primary break in a verse, marked by a short pause. Because etnaḥta marks the halfway point in a verse, citing biblical verses, particularly in the poetic sections, some scholars will refer to everything up to the etnaḥta as &quot;a&quot;, and everything after as &quot;b&quot; (example: Genesis 1:1a).
;Azla Geresh/Geresh:&quot;Azla divorced&quot; (if called &quot;azla geresh&quot;) or &quot;Expulsion, divorce&quot; (if called just &quot;geresh&quot;). So called because it is often &quot;partnered&quot; with the Qadma (as an Azla) but here appears on its own, &quot;separated.&quot;
;Gershayim:Double Geresh, from its appearance and tune.
;Mahpakh:&quot;Turning round&quot;. Originally written like a sideways U, like a U turn. In printed books, it has a V shape, possibly because that was easier for the early printers to make. In Sephardi communities it is called &quot;shofar mehuppach&quot;, &quot;reversed horn&quot;, either because of the above reason, or because it faces the other way from &quot;shofar holekh&quot; (&quot;munakh&quot;).
;Merkha/Ma&#x27;arikh:&quot;Lengthener&quot;, because it prolongs the word that follows. In modern usage it is sometimes translated as &quot;comma&quot;, but this usage is taken from the cantillation&#x27;s appearance, and is misleading because merkha is conjunctive, whereas a comma marks a break.
;Merkha-kefulah/Tere Ta`ameh:&quot;Kefulah&quot; means &quot;doubled&quot;, because it looks like two adjacent ; alternatively, &quot;Tere&quot; means &quot;two&quot;, because it looks like two adjacent Ma`arikhs. There are only five occurrences in the whole Torah: Gen. 27:25, Ex. 5:15, Lev. 10:1, Num. 14:3, and Num. 32:42.
;Munakh/Shophar Holekh:&quot;Resting&quot;, because it is shaped like a horn lying on its side.:In Sephardi communities it is called &quot;shofar holekh&quot;, &quot;going-horn&quot;, because it appears as a horn, and makes the word it appears under &quot;go&quot; into the following word (i.e., it has the grammatical function of making the word secondary to the following one).: &quot;&quot;munakh&quot; by itself&quot; is a disjunctive, used mainly before &quot;revia&quot;, but occasionally before a pazer. It may be distinguished from ordinary &quot;munakh&quot; by the dividing line () following the word.
;Pashta:&quot;Stretching out&quot;, because its shape is an abstraction of a hand stretched forward.
;Pazer:&quot;Lavish&quot; or &quot;strewn&quot;, because it has a complex tune with many notes.:In Sephardi communities, its called &quot;Pazer Gadol&quot;, meaning &quot;great Pazer&quot;, for the same reason.
;Qadma:&quot;precede&quot;, &quot;before&quot;, &quot;prior [one]&quot;, &quot;going forward&quot;, &quot;starting&quot;; Always occurs at the beginning of a phrase (often before other conjunctives) with a shape like a hand leaning forward, identical to Pashta (see above). In particular it is the first member of the &quot;Qadma ve-Azla&quot; pair (see Azla, above).
;Rebhiya`/Rabhiya`: Usually Aramaic for &quot;fourth [in a sequence]&quot;, for obscure reasons. Likely due to its four-note tune.: Some Ashkenazi Jews call it &quot;revi&#x27;i&quot; by a process of folk etymology. Since in many printings it appears as a diamond-shape above the word, folk etymology associates &quot;revi&#x27;a&quot; with &quot;ravua&quot;, meaning &quot;square&quot;. In some printings it appears as a solid circle. A more likely explanation is that it is from the Aramaic for &quot;crouching&quot;, referring to its position vertically above the word and its descending tone.
;Segol:&quot;grape-bunch&quot; (from its shape, which looks like a bunch of grapes), not to be confused with the vowel of the same name, which appears beneath a letter, whereas this appears above. The cantillation mark is an inversion of the vowel.
;Shalshelet:&quot;Chain&quot;, either from its appearance or because it is a long chain of notes. There are only four occurrences in the whole Torah: Gen. 19:16, 24:12, 39:8, and Lev. 8:23.
;Sof Pasuk:&quot;End [of] verse&quot;: The last note of every verse, sometimes called &quot;silluq&quot; (taking leave).
;: &quot;Detached&quot; because they are never linked to the following note as one musical phrase. Gedolah = great (long); = small (short);: Sephardim have different names for each of the two: &quot;Telisha Qetannah&quot; is called &quot;Tarsa&quot;; &quot;Telisha Gedolah&quot; is called &quot;Talshah&quot;, also meaning &quot;Detached&quot;.:
;Tevir:&quot;broken&quot;, &quot;downward tumble&quot;, because of its tune. Frequently paired with darga.
;Tifqha/Tarqha:&quot;Diagonal&quot;, or &quot;hand-breadth&quot;. Originally drawn as a straight diagonal line. In printed books, it is curved, apparently to make it a mirror image of Mercha, with which it is usually paired (the two together could be regarded as forming a slur). The name &quot;tifcha&quot; may be an allusion to a hand signal.:Sephardim call it &quot;Tarqha&quot;, meaning &quot;dragging&quot;, due to its tune, and possibly its grammatical function.:
;Yetibh:Short for &quot;Shofar yetibh&quot;, &quot;Resting horn&quot; or &quot;sitting horn&quot;, probably because of its shape of a horn sitting upright.:
;Zaqef Qaton/Gadol:&quot;Upright/erect&quot;, from their vertical shape, or from their grammatical function to separate a phrase whatever follows.:&quot;Zaqef Gadol&quot; = great &quot;Zaqef&quot;, named so for its longer tune and because it more strongly separates the word as its own phrase.:&quot;Zaqef Qatton&quot; = small &quot;Zaqef&quot;, named so for its relatively shorter tune and weaker grammatical function as compared to &quot;Zaqef Gadol&quot;.:
;Zarqa:&quot;Scatterer&quot;, because of its complex tune of a scattering of notes.

Verse 90 of Parashat Mas`ei (Numbers 35 verse 5) contains the following two notes, found nowhere else in the Torah:
;Qarne Farah:&quot;Horns of a cow&quot; named so because it resembles the horns of a cow.:
;Yerach ben Yomo:&quot;Moon of its day&quot; [i.e. day-old moon] because it looks like a crescent moon; sometimes called &quot;galgal&quot; (circle).

==Sequences==
The rules governing the sequence of cantillation marks are as follows.
#A verse is divided into two half verses, the first ending with, and governed by, &quot;etnachta&quot;, and the second ending with, and governed by, &quot;sof pasuk&quot;. A very short verse may have no &quot;etnachta&quot; and be governed by &quot;sof pasuk&quot; alone.
#A half verse may be divided into two or more phrases marked off by second-level disjunctives.
#A second-level phrase may be divided into two or more sub-phrases marked off by third-level disjunctives.
#A third-level phrase may be divided into two or more sub-phrases marked off by fourth-level disjunctives.
#The last subdivision within a phrase must always be constituted by a disjunctive one level down, chosen to fit the disjunctive governing the phrase and called (in the Table below) its &quot;near companion&quot;. Thus, a disjunctive may be preceded by a disjunctive of its own or a higher level, or by its near companion, but not by any other disjunctive of a lower level than its own.
#The other subdivisions within a phrase are constituted by the &quot;default&quot; disjunctive for the next lower level (the &quot;remote companion&quot;).
#Any disjunctive may or may not be preceded by one or more conjunctives, varying with the disjunctive in question.
#A disjunctive constituting a phrase on its own (i.e. not preceded by either a near companion or a conjunctive) may be substituted by a stronger disjunctive of the same level, called in the Table the &quot;equivalent isolated disjunctive&quot;.

=== Groups ===
The following sequences are commonly found:

==== First-level phrases ====
;(Mercha) Tifcha (Mercha) Sof-Pasuk [Sephardic: Ma׳ariqh Tarqha Ma׳ariqh Sof-Pasuq]:The group that occurs at the end of each &quot;pasuk&quot; (verse), and always includes the Sof-Pasuk at the very minimum. Either or both of the may be omitted.
;(Mercha) Tifcha (Munach) Etnachta [Sephardic: Ma&#x27;ariqh Tarqha Shofar-holekh Atnaqh]:One of the most common groups, but can only appear once in each &quot;pasuk&quot;. Tifcha can appear without a Mercha, but Mercha cannot appear without a Tifcha (or other following disjunctive). Etnachta can appear without a Munach, but Munach cannot appear without an Etnachta (or other following disjunctive). Munach-Etnachta can appear without a Mercha-Tifcha, but a Mercha-Tifcha cannot appear without a Munach-Etnachta (or Etnachta on its own).:

====Second-level phrases====
;(Mahpach) Pashta (Munach) Zaqef-qaton [Sephardic: Mehuppakh Qadma Shofar-holekh Zaqef-qaton]:One of the most common groups. Pashta can appear without a Mahpach, but a Mahpach cannot appear without a Pashta. Alternatively, &quot;Yetiv&quot; can appear on its own in place of Pashta. Zaqef Qaton can appear without a Munach, but a Munach cannot appear without a Qaton (or other following disjunctive).
;Zakef-gadol:Not a part of a group; replaces a Zaqef-qaton sequence.
;[Munach] Zarqa [Munach] Segol [Sephardic: Shofar-holekh Zarqa Shofar-holekh Segolta]:Zarqa only occurs before Segol.
;Shalshelet:Not a part of a group; replaces a Segol sequence. Occurs only four times in the Torah, and always at the beginning of a verse.:

==== Third-level phrases ====
;Munach Paseq Munach Rebhia [Sephardic: Shofar-holekh Paseq Shofar-holekh Rabhia`]:The following combinations occur: Revia on its own; Munach Revia; Darga Munach Revia; Munach-with-Pesiq Revia; Munach-with-Pesiq Munach Revia. (Munach with Pesiq is a disjunctive, separate from Munach proper, and also known as , munach on its own.)
;Darga Tebhir:Tevir is found either alone or preceded by Darga or Mercha. Darga occasionally precedes other combinations (e.g. Darga Munach Rebhia).
;Mercha-Kefula (Sephardic Tere ta&#x27;ame):Occasionally preceded by Darga, but usually on its own. Occurs only five times in the Torah, and once in Haftarah. Its function appears to be similar to Tebhir.:

==== Fourth-level phrases ====
;Kadma v&#x27;Azla [Sephardic: Azla Geirish]:This pair is known as such when found together, and may precede a Mahpach, a Revi&#x27;a group or a Tevir group. A Kadma can also be found without an Azla before a Mahpach, and an Azla without a Kadma is known as Azla-Geresh or simply Geresh. Gershayim on its own fulfils the same function as Kadma v&#x27;Azla, in that it can precede either a Mahpach, a Revia group or a Tevir group.
;Pazer:Not considered part of a group, but usually followed by a or a Telisha Gedolah. It may be preceded by one or more Munach&#x27;s.
; [Sephardic: Talsha/Tirsa]:Not considered a part of a group, usually appears individually, sometimes after a Pazer. It often precedes Kadma.
;Yerach-ben-yomo Karnei-farah [Sephardic: Yareyach-ben-yomo Karneh-phara]:Occurs only once in the whole Torah, in the parashah Masei, on the words &quot;alpayim b&#x27;amah&quot; (two thousand cubits). It is somewhat equivalent to Munach Pazer.

==Psalms, Proverbs and Job==
The system of cantillation signs used throughout the Tanakh is replaced by a very different system for these three poetic books. Many of the signs may &quot;appear&quot; the same or similar at first glance, but most of them serve entirely different functions in these three books. (Only a few signs have functions similar to what they do in the rest of the Tanakh.) The short narratives at the beginning and end of Job use the &quot;regular&quot; system, but the bulk of the book (the poetry) uses the special system. For this reason, these three books are referred to as &quot;sifrei emet&quot; (Books of Truth), the word &quot;emet&quot; meaning &quot;truth&quot;, but also being an acronym (אמ״ת) for the first letters of the three books (Iyov, Mishle, Tehillim).

A verse may be divided into one, two or three stichs. In a two-stich verse, the first stich ends with &quot;atnach&quot;. In a three-stich verse, the first stich ends with &quot;oleh ve-yored&quot;, which looks like &quot;mahpach&quot; (above the word) followed by &quot;tifcha&quot;, on either the same word or two consecutive words, and the second stich ends with &quot;atnach&quot;.

Major disjunctives within a stich are (immediately before &quot;oleh ve-yored&quot;), &quot;revia gadol&quot; (elsewhere) and &quot;tzinnor&quot; (which looks like &quot;zarqa&quot;). The first (or only) stich in a verse may be divided by &quot;dechi&quot;, which looks like &quot;tifcha&quot; but goes under the first letter of the word to the right of the vowel sign. The last stich in a two- or three-stich verse may be divided by &quot;revia megurash&quot;, which looks like &quot;geresh&quot; combined with &quot;revia&quot;.

Minor disjunctives are &quot;pazer gadol&quot;, &quot;shalshelet gedolah&quot;, (looking like &quot;qadma&quot;) and (looking like &quot;mahpach&quot;): all of these except &quot;pazer&quot; are followed by a . &quot;Mehuppach&quot; without a sometimes occurs at the beginning of a stich.

All other accents are conjunctives.

==Mishnah and Talmud==

Some manuscripts of early Rabbinic literature contain marks for partial or systematic cantillation. This is true of the Sifra, and especially of Genizah fragments of the Mishnah.

Today, many communities have a special tune for the Mishnaic passage &quot;Bammeh madliqin&quot; in the Friday night service. Otherwise, there is often a customary intonation used in the study of Mishnah or Talmud, somewhat similar to an Arabic mawwal, but this is not reduced to a precise system like that for the Biblical books. Recordings have been made for Israeli national archives, and Frank Alvarez-Pereyre has published a book-length study of the Syrian tradition of Mishnah reading on the basis of these recordings.

On the relationship between the cantillation marks found in some manuscripts and the intonation used in Ashkenazi Talmud study, see Zelda Kahan Newman, &quot;The Jewish Sound of Speech: Talmudic Chant, Yiddish Intonation and the Origins of Early Ashkenaz&quot;.

==In Christian missionary uses==

The Jewish-born Christian convert Ezekiel Margoliouth translated the New Testament to Hebrew in 1865 with cantillation marks added. It is the only completely cantillated translation of the New Testament. The translation was published by the London Jews&#x27; Society.

<doc id="622925" wikidata="Q470782" url="?curid=622925" title="George Van Biesbroeck">
<text>George A. Van Biesbroeck (or Georges-Achille Van Biesbroeck, , January 21, 1880 – February 23, 1974) was a Belgian–American astronomer. He worked at observatories in Belgium, Germany and the United States. He specialized in the observation of double stars, asteroids and comets. He is notable for his long career as an observational astronomer.

== Life ==

He was born in Ghent, Belgium on January 21, 1880, to a family of artists. At his father&#x27;s request he pursued, and in 1902, he received, the 1st degree of Civil Engineering Construction and began work as a civil engineer for the Brussels Department of Roads and Bridges. But his true vocation is not there, it was astronomy, and while performing his official duties as a civil engineer he joined volunteers at the Uccle Observatory. In 1904 he left civil engineering behind and joined the staff at the Royal Observatory of Belgium at Uccle.

He then enrolled at Ghent University and obtained a degree in theoretical astronomy. He worked at the Heidelberg Observatory, then at the Potsdam Observatory under the direction of Max Wolf, Karl Schwarzschild and others.

In 1915, as World War I was raging, he was invited to come to work at Yerkes Observatory. He and his family made the dangerous trip across wartime Europe and settled permanently in the United States. He became a U.S citizen in 1922. He then began his work on double stars, comets, asteroids, and variable stars. In 1945 he was forced into retirement at Yerkes at the age of 65. Relieved of administrative duties, he became an even more active observer at Yerkes and at the McDonald Observatory. He made the frequent automobile trips between the observatories in Wisconsin and Texas without complaint.

He participated in numerous physically grueling astronomical expeditions to remote parts of the world throughout the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1952, at age 72, he traveled to Khartoum in Sudan and set up a 20&#x27; telescope to confirm Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity by noting the change in positions of the stars around the Sun during a total eclipse that year. His measurements were in agreement with Einstein&#x27;s predictions. His travels to Sudan were the subject of a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article.

== Discoveries ==

He discovered the periodic comet 53P/Van Biesbroeck, as well as two non-periodic comets: C/1925 W1 (Van Biesbroeck 1) and C/1935 Q1 (Van Biesbroeck 2).

He also discovered sixteen asteroids between 1922 and 1939 &quot;(see adjunct table)&quot;, and 43 double stars.

In 1961 he published the Van Biesbroeck&#x27;s star catalog. In this he cataloged a number of very faint stars, known by the &quot;VB&quot; numbers he assigned to them upon discovery. One notable star he discovered was the very small red dwarf secondary star, &quot;VB 10&quot;, also known as Gliese (GJ) 752B, of the primary star, Wolf 1055 (Gliese (GJ) 752A). This star was unique in that its absolute magnitude of 19 was the lowest of any star then known and still thought to be the lowest possible for any star. &quot;VB 10&quot; was given the designation of &quot;Van Biesbroeck&#x27;s Star&quot; to honor him for this work and his work with double stars.

== Later life and death ==

In 1963 he came to the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona in Tucson Arizona to work under Gerard Kuiper. There he used his practical skills as a land surveyor to site the new Catalina Station now under the direction of Steward Observatory and that now houses the 1.6m Kuiper Telescope. He continued to observe and make contributions to astronomy up to a few months before his death. New scientific papers continued to be published under his name for several years afterward. He died on February 23, 1974, at the age of 94.

== Honors and awards ==

Throughout his long and productive life he received many honors. This is a partial list.
* Gold Medal of the Royal Danish Society of Sciences (1910)
* Donohe Comet Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (1926)
* Valz Prize of the French Academy of Sciences (1928)
* Burr Prize from the National Geographic Society (1952)
* Price Valzer de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences Paris
* James Craig Watson Medal (1957)

<text>Juhu (Pronunciation: ) is a suburb of Mumbai. It is known for the sprawling Juhu Beach. It is surrounded by the Arabian Sea to the west, Versova to the north, Vile Parle to the east and Santacruz to the south. Juhu is among the most expensive and affluent areas of the metropolitan area and home to many Bollywood celebrities. The nearest railway stations are Santacruz, Andheri and Vile Parle on the Western Line and Harbour Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway. The nearest metro stations are D. N. Nagar and Andheri West. There are two minor B.E.S.T bus depots in Juhu.

J. R. D. Tata, the father of civil aviation in India, made his maiden voyage to Juhu Airport from Drigh Road airstrip, Karachi, via Ahmedabad, on 15 October 1932 carrying mail in a Puss Moth aircraft.

==Climate==
Juhu enjoys a uniform climate throughout the year. In summers the maximum temperature reaches and the minimum temperature is . The weather remains hot through winter. Monsoons prevail from mid-June to September, when it rains quite heavily.

==History==
In the nineteenth century, Juhu was an island: a long, narrow sand bar rising above sea level by a metre or two, just off the west coast of Salsette. It could be reached during low tides by walking across the tidal inlet.

Juhu was called &quot;Juvem&quot; by the Portuguese. At its north point, nestled the village of Juhu, inhabited by Agris (salt traders) and Kunbis (cultivators) and at its south point, opposite Bandra island, lived a small colony of fisherfolk and cultivators (Koliwada). The inhabitants of Juhu were mainly Koli people and there was a small section of Goans. The Church of St. Joseph was built by the Portuguese in 1853.
The open beaches of Juhu have attracted the well-heeled and the most affluent among Mumbai&#x27;s population for almost a century. In the 1890s, Jamsetji Tata purchased land on Juhu and built a bungalow there. He planned to develop in Juhu Tara. This was to yield 500 plots of each and a seaside resort. Simultaneously he wanted to extend the Mahim Causeway to Santacruz, to access to this area. After his death in 1904, the scheme was abandoned. With the dawn of aviation in the 20th century, the Bombay Flying Club commenced operations in 1929 at what eventually became the present Juhu Aerodrome.

During the Indian independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi visited Mumbai and took several walks along Juhu Beach. A famous photograph of Gandhi poking his grandson Kanaa during a walk on the beach was taken in 1937. To mark Gandhi&#x27;s visit to Juhu, a statue of him was installed by the beach and a lane near the beach was named Gandhigram Road. There is also a school named after him, the Gandhi Shiksha Bhavan school, in Juhu.

In the 1970s, Bhaktivedanta Swami (Srila Prabhupada) started the Hare Krishna Movement and built ISKCON Temple.

Founded in 1928 as India&#x27;s first civil aviation airport, Juhu aerodrome served as the city&#x27;s primary airport during and up to World War II. In the 1990s, a group of terror suspects detonated a bomb in a Juhu hotel, as well as in a number of other locations.

==Juhu Beach ==
Juhu Beach is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea. It stretches for six kilometres up to Versova. The short, rocky formations make up the Juhu Beach unlike the Marina Beach in Chennai that is primarily sandy. It is a tourist attraction throughout the year and is also a destination for shooting films. The beach generally gets more crowded on weekends and public holidays. The food court at its main entrance is known for its &#x27;Mumbai style&#x27; street food, notably bhelpuri, pani puri and sev puri. Horse-pulled carriages used to offer joyrides to tourists for a small fee but have been banned now. Acrobats, dancing monkeys, cricket matches, toy sellers,Youth are playing old games vie for tourist&#x27;s attention. The beach is among the most popular sites in the city for the annual Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations where thousands of devotees arrive in grand processions, carrying idols of the Lord Ganesh of various sizes, to be immersed in the sea at the beach. Juhu Beach is also a common spot for plane spotting as a portion of it lies underneath the departure path from Runway 27 and occasionally, the arrival path from Runway 09 of Mumbai Airport. There are several small entrances to the beach throughout the stretch, however the main and most used entrance is near Hotel Ramada Plaza By Wyndham Palm Grove. The best time to visit Juhu Beach is from September to May, as during the monsoon period of June to August the tide is mostly high which makes it dangerous to wander around on the beach.

=== Home to celebrities ===

The busy-yet-peaceful surroundings of Juhu is home to many Bollywood celebrities and a significant number of Mumbai&#x27;s business elite. Hence, Juhu has come to be referred to as the &quot;Beverly Hills of Bollywood&quot;.

==Juhu Citizen Welfare Group==
The Juhu Citizen Welfare Group is the outcome of many years of activism by Juhu residents who have been associated with other NGOs. It was formed in April 2002 (The Juhu Seatizen) and later formalised in August 2003 with its own monthly publication called &quot;The Juhu Citizen&quot;. Officially registered in March 2004, it now comprises voluntary members invited from NGOs in the K-West Municipal Ward of North West Mumbai.

<doc id="622927" wikidata="Q1541108" url="?curid=622927" title="Pot Black">
<text>Pot Black was a snooker tournament in the United Kingdom broadcast on the BBC. Each match was contested over a single , where other tournaments were significantly longer. The event carried no ranking points, but played a large part in the popularisation of the modern game of snooker. The event was first held in 1969 with a field of eight players and ran annually until 1986. The event resurfaced for three years in both 1991 and 2005. The series was followed by events for other categories of players, with juniors and seniors events, and a celebrity version held in 2006.

The series was created by the BBC2 controller David Attenborough, shortly after BBC2 began broadcasting in colour. Snooker, a game using coloured balls, was suggested as a suitable way to sell the new technology. The series helped transform snooker from a minority sport played by just a handful of professionals into one of the most popular sports in the UK. Mark Williams made the highest in the competition&#x27;s history, a 119.

==History==
The BBC began broadcasting in colour in 1967 and was on the lookout for programmes that would exploit the new technology. The idea of broadcasting snooker, then still a minor sport, was the brainchild of David Attenborough who was the controller of BBC2 at the time. Based on , the game of snooker was recognised as a good way to promote the BBC&#x27;s new colour broadcasting capability.

The first Pot Black tournament was held in 1969 at the BBC Studios in Birmingham, and the recorded &quot;Pot Black&quot; programme was aired on BBC2 on 23 July 1969. This first edition featured eight players: Gary Owen, Jackie Rea, John Pulman, Ray Reardon, Fred Davis, Rex Williams, Kingsley Kennerley and John Spencer, the eventual winner being Reardon. The programme continued until 1986, by which time an increasing number of snooker events were being televised and the &quot;Pot Black&quot; format was becoming outdated. The programme was revived in 1990 but was then discontinued after the 1993 edition.

A one-day Pot Black tournament was held on 29 October 2005, and the final match was broadcast live on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Grandstand&quot; programme. The eight players in the 2005 event were: Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, Stephen Hendry, Stephen Maguire, Matthew Stevens, Paul Hunter, John Higgins, Jimmy White and Shaun Murphy, with Stevens beating Murphy in the final. The 2006 edition of the tournament took place at the Royal Automobile Club in Central London on 2 September 2006; Mark Williams defeated John Higgins in the final with a 119 clearance, the highest break in the event&#x27;s history. In the 2007 edition, the last &quot;Pot Black&quot; (to date) which aired on Saturday 6 October 2007, Ken Doherty won the final 71–36 against Murphy.

There have been six century breaks compiled at the event. The first was Eddie Charlton&#x27;s break of 110 against Spencer in 1973, which stood as the tournament&#x27;s record for many years until overtaken by Murphy&#x27;s 111 against White in 2005, and the 119 clearance by Williams in 2006.

==Format==
The Pot Black tournament used several formats over its history. Eight players participated in the first event, but the number of players varied between six and sixteen over the years. It was originally played as a knockout tournament, but later employed a round-robin format. The total number of points scored by each player could often become crucial, so the matches were always played to a conclusion with the potting of the . Most of the matches were played over a single frame. Several formats were employed for the final match, which was also played over just one frame for the first few years; an aggregate score over two frames was tried in 1974, but this format was abandoned and the single-frame final was reinstated in 1975; the final was decided over three frames from 1978 to 1986, and in 1991. A shot clock timer was added in 1991, to limit the amount of time each player could spend at the table.

A &quot;Junior Pot Black&quot; ran for three years, from 1981 to 1983, and again in 1991. The winners were Dean Reynolds, John Parrott (twice) and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. The junior tournament was revived in 2006 as a side event to the World Snooker Championship, with the final played on the main match table. A &quot;Seniors Pot Black&quot; was held in 1997, featuring players aged over 40 at the time. Joe Johnson won the senior event.

A one-frame &quot;Celebrity Pot Black&quot; took place on 15 July 2006 for Sport Relief. It was contested between two teams: Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan and Bradley Walsh against Steve Davis and Vernon Kay. The winning team was Davis and Kay. The match was refereed by Michaela Tabb, presented by Dermot O&#x27;Leary and commentated by John Parrott.

==Production==
Each Pot Black tournament was recorded in a single day at the BBC&#x27;s Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, and the matches were then shown in half-hour &quot;Pot Black&quot; programmes on BBC2 over the winter. The press co-operated by not revealing the scores until after a match had been transmitted. In 2005 and 2006, the whole tournament was broadcast in a single day. &quot;Pot Black&quot;″s theme tune was &quot;Black and White Rag&quot;, composed by George Botsford and performed by Winifred Atwell.

The first series of &quot;Pot Black&quot; in 1969 was presented by Keith Macklin. It was then hosted by Alan Weeks until 1984, and David Icke in 1985 and 1986. Eamonn Holmes was host in 1991 and 1992, and he was replaced by David Vine in 1993. Vine also presented &quot;Senior Pot Black&quot; in 1997. The latest revival of the programme in the early 2000s was hosted by Hazel Irvine.

&quot;Pot Black&quot; is credited with producing one of the most memorable British sports quotes. Commentator Ted Lowe, aware that not all viewers had colour televisions at the time, said &quot;Steve is going for the pink ball – and for those of you who are watching in black and white, the pink is next to the green.&quot;

<doc id="622932" wikidata="Q4672722" url="?curid=622932" title="According to Mary Magdalene">
<text>According to Mary Magdalene (, 1997) is a novel by the Swedish novelist Marianne Fredriksson. It attempts to portray the life of the biblical figure of Mary Magdalene as told by herself. The author claims to have based the book on Gnostic manuscripts, such as the Gospel of Mary, that were discovered in recent times. The English version was published 1999.

==Plot introduction==
The story offers a feminist perspective on the person of Christ and on the beginnings of the Christian Church. Since it presents Jesus as merely a human being and deviates from the orthodox biblical portrayal of the Son of Man, the novel was severely criticised by mainstream Christians.

<doc id="622936" wikidata="Q676745" url="?curid=622936" title="County of Armagnac">
<text>The County of Armagnac (, ; ), situated between the Adour and Garonne rivers in the lower foothills of the Pyrenées, was a historic county of the Duchy of Gascony, established in 601 in Aquitaine (now France). In 960, the title of &#x27;Count of Armagnac&#x27; was established, and thus the County of Armagnac was created. In 1751, following the death of childless Charles de Lorraine, Comte d&#x27;Armagnac, the county was absorbed into the Crown lands of France and the King, then Louis XV took the title of &#x27;Count of Armagnac&#x27; (&quot;Comte d&#x27;Armagnac&quot;). In 1791, following the decree dividing France into departments, the county was disestablished, but remains an important natural region of France.

==History==

Under Roman rule, Armagnac was included in the Civitas Ausciorum, or district of Auch, of Aquitania. Under the Merovingians it was part of the duchy of Aquitania. Near the end of the ninth century the part now known as Fezensac became a hereditary county. In 960, Armagnac was separated from Fezensac as a separate county, under Bernard le Louche, Géraud Trancaléon and Bernard II, who reunited under his control all of Gascony (1040–1052); in 1052 Gascony became part of &quot;Aquitania&quot;, by personal union of duke William VIII. About 1140 Bernard&#x27;s grandson, Géraud III, briefly reunited the comté of Fezensac, which was then detached as an appanage for a younger son, styled &quot;comté de Fézensaguet&quot;. When Gascogne was linked once more to Aquitaine by the Treaty of Meaux in 1229, the county of Armagnac was the most powerful of the fiefs of Gascony. The chance of dynastic succession continued repeatedly to separate Fezensac.

The three great territorial lords in the south were the Count of Armagnac, the Count of Foix, and the Lord of Albret. The counts of Armagnac increased their territory through marriage and purchase. Jean I, comte d&#x27;Armagnac (1319–1373) and his successors joined to Armagnac the comté of Rodez and that of Carlat, and the vicomtés of Lomagne and Auvillars, Comminges and briefly Charolais (which Jean III alienated in 1390).

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War the southern part of France, including Armagnac, was ceded to England by the Treaty of Brétigny (1360). Edward, the Black Prince, administered the region for his father, King Edward III of England. He soon alienated the nobles by giving privileges to the towns and levying heavy taxes. Until this time Armagnac had remained practically independent by shifting alliances, but the rule of the Black Prince was so harsh that the count of Armagnac appealed to the French king for help in 1369. By submitting themselves to King Charles V of France, noble families like the Armagnacs were able to retain much of their former power and assure themselves of protection.

In 1410 the daughter of Count Bernard VII of Armagnac (d. 1418) was married to Duke Charles I of Orleans. Charles&#x27; father had been killed by supporters of the duke of Burgundy, who resented Orleans&#x27; influence on the king. After the marriage, the Armagnac family became associated with the part of King Charles VI against Burgundy, and the royal faction came to be called Armagnacs. Until his death in 1418, Count Bernard remained a bitter enemy of Burgundy. When Burgundy allied itself with England during the later stages of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the friction between the two parties greatly increased. The two factions engaged in a bloody civil war that ended in 1435.

After peace was established, many veterans originally recruited by Count Bernard VII formed mercenary bands that also became known as the Armagnacs. Although they were in the service of King Charles VII, the Armagnacs became notorious for their rapacious plundering in the north of France. In 1444 they were sent to Switzerland on an expedition known as the Armagnac War, which culminated in a battle between the Swiss and the Armagnac mercenaries on August 26, 1444. Although the Swiss were badly defeated, their determined resistance persuaded the Armagnacs to withdraw from Switzerland. Soon after, the Armagnacs were incorporated into Charles VII&#x27;s regular army.

After the death of Bernard VII in 1418, the counts of Armagnac gradually lost their powerful position in southern France. In the late fifteenth century Count Jean V opposed King Louis XI. He was driven from the Armagnac lands and was killed by the king&#x27;s soldiers in 1473. After the last court died in 1497, Armagnac was united temporarily with the crown. However, King Francis I gave the district to a nephew of the last count, and it subsequently passed by marriage to the family of Henry of Navarre. Henry became king of France as Henry IV in 1589 and joined Armagnac to the royal domain in 1607. In 1645, Louis XIV granted the title to Henri de Lorraine-Harcourt, whose heirs possessed it until the Revolution.

== Government ==
In 1473, following the control of the county by Louis XI, the Seneschalcy of Armagnac was created. This allowed for a stationing of a seneschal in the county, acting as an agent of the crown.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, the County of Armagnac was an administrative division of the General Government of Guyenne and Gascony (&quot;Gouvernement-Général de Guienne et Gascogne&quot;). During this period the government was divided into the Duchy of Guyenne and Duchy of Gascony, of which the division was part of the latter.

Following the decree dividing France into departments announced on 22 December 1789, the County of Armagnac was disestablished. The majority of the county formed part of the new Department of Gers, while the far western parts became part of Landes.

==List of counts==
==Geography==

The region is watered by several small rivers that descend from the Lannemezan plateau; the river Gers is the largest of these. The region is centered at approximately 43°40&#x27;N 0°12&#x27;E (43.7, 0.2).

<text>Alexandre Schaumasse (1882–1958) was a French astronomer and discoverer of comets and minor planets.

His discoveries include the periodic comet 24P/Schaumasse, and the two non-periodic comets C/1913 J1 (Schaumasse) or 1913 II, and C/1917 H1 (Schaumasse) or 1917 II. He also discovered two asteroids, 971 Alsatia and 1114 Lorraine, in 1921 and 1928, respectively.

Gaston Fayet, director of the Observatory in Nice, gave him the responsibility of the &quot;Chercheur de comètes&quot; (Comet finder), a 25 cm (F/D 7.2) refractor offered by Germany to France after the first World War. However, it appears he never made any serious observations with this instrument due to its &quot;abundance of aberrations&quot;, according to fellow astronomer Robert Jonckhèere. The two instruments he used most were the Grand Equatorial Coudé (with which he recorded most of his observations), and the Petit Equatorial (current dome Charlois).

He was severely wounded in 1914 while serving in the French army during World War I, and spent at least a year in hospital.

He was awarded the Valz Prize &quot;(Prix Valz)&quot; for 1917 by the French Academy of Sciences. In 1943, he was awarded the Lalande Prize.

The building that houses &quot;Chercheur de comètes&quot;, built in 1931, now bears his name (Schaumasse dome). The inner main-belt asteroid 1797 Schaumasse was named in his honor ().

<doc id="622940" wikidata="Q7729805" url="?curid=622940" title="The Desert Song">
<text>The Desert Song is an operetta with music by Sigmund Romberg and book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II, Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel. It was inspired by the 1925 uprising of the Riffs, a group of Berber fighters, against French colonial rule in Morocco. It was also inspired by stories of Lawrence of Arabia aiding native guerrillas. Many tales romanticizing Saharan North Africa were in vogue, including &quot;Beau Geste&quot; and &quot;The Son of the Sheik&quot;.

Originally titled &quot;Lady Fair&quot;, after successful out-of-town tryouts in Wilmington, Delaware, and Boston, Massachusetts, the original Broadway production opened at the Casino Theatre on November 30, 1926, and ran for a very successful 465 performances. It starred Vivienne Segal as Margot Bonvalet and Edmund Elton as General Birabeau. The piece enjoyed a London production and was revived on Broadway in 1946 and 1973. In the 1980s, it was played regularly by the Light Opera of Manhattan and revived by the New York City Opera. It is a popular piece for community light opera groups.

The story is a version of plots such as &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot;, &quot;Zorro&quot; and later &quot;Superman&quot;, where a hero adopts a mild-mannered disguise to keep his true identity a secret. He loves a beautiful and spirited girl, who loves his hero persona but does not know his real personality, which he keeps hidden under the facade.

==Productions and film versions==
The leading man in the original Broadway production was Scottish baritone Richard Halliday and the heroine, Vivienne Segal. It was directed by Arthur Hurley and choreographed by Bobby Connolly, who was later to choreograph the classic 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. In the 1927 London production at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane the leading roles were taken by Harry Welchman and Edith Day, and numerous excerpts were recorded with the London cast supported by the Drury Lane orchestra and chorus under conductor Herman Finck. The show was briefly revived on Broadway in 1946 (at New York City Center) and 1973.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the Light Opera of Manhattan mounted the operetta several times. To celebrate the centennial of Romberg&#x27;s birth in 1987, New York City Opera staged a lavish production with Richard White and Linda Michele. &quot;The Desert Song&quot; is still occasionally performed and has been made into a motion picture four times, though the second version was a short subject, rather than a feature-length film. All film versions were made by Warner Brothers.

In 1929, a lavish film with Technicolor sequences starred John Boles as the Red Shadow and Carlotta King as Margot, and featured Myrna Loy as Azuri. This version was scrupulously faithful to, and captured the spirit of, the original Broadway production and became a hit. By the 1940s, the 1929 film could not be shown in the United States because of its Pre-Code content, which included sexual innuendo, suggestive humor and open discussion of themes such as homosexuality. Apparently, the Technicolor sequences have survived only in black-and-white. To capitalize on the success of the original picture, in 1932 Warner Bros. released &quot;The Red Shadow,&quot; a 19-minute black-and-white short consisting chiefly of musical numbers. This film, which has been restored, was directed by Roy Mack, and starred Alexander Gray and Bernice Claire.

A second feature film was made in 1943. The plot was altered to have the hero fighting the Nazis. Filmed entirely in three-strip Technicolor, it starred Dennis Morgan and Irene Manning. A third color feature version was made in 1953, with most of the adult themes and humor being removed or &quot;sanitized&quot;. This version altered the plot to make General Birabeau the father of Margot, rather than the father of the Red Shadow, as in the play. It starred Kathryn Grayson and Gordon MacRae, and featured Allyn McLerie as Azuri. Both the 1943 and the 1953 films changed the hero&#x27;s name from the Red Shadow to El Khobar. In the 1953 version, El Khobar&#x27;s disguise was that of a mild-mannered Latin teacher who tutored Margot and had to fend off her amorous advances (which were fairly discreet by modern standards). Also in 1953, all the singing was done by El Khobar, Margot and the male chorus. None of the other characters in the film sing.

Another sanitized version was adapted for live television in 1955 (with Nelson Eddy, Gale Sherwood and Salvatore Baccaloni as Ali Ben Ali). One of the writers brought in to shorten and modernize some risque dialogue was the young Neil Simon.

==Synopsis==
French General Birabeau has been sent to Morocco to root out and destroy the Riffs, a band of desert rebels, who threaten the safety of the French outpost in the Moroccan desert. Their dashing, daredevil leader is the mysterious &quot;Red Shadow&quot;, a Frenchman. The Red Shadow, his Berber lieutenant, Sid El Kar, and their wealthy host, Ali Ben Ali, discuss the relative merits of the Eastern tradition of love for a harem of women (like having a garden full of fragrant flowers), and the Western ideal of loving one woman for life. Margot Bonvalet, a lovely, sassy French girl, is soon to be married at the French fort to Birabeau&#x27;s right-hand man, Captain Fontaine. Birabeau&#x27;s son Pierre, in reality the Red Shadow, loves Margot, but pretends to be a milksop to preserve his secret identity. Meanwhile, Benny, a reporter, and Susan, the girl who loves him, provide comic relief.

Margot tells Pierre that she secretly yearns to be swept into the arms of some bold, dashing sheik, perhaps even the Red Shadow himself. Pierre, as the Red Shadow, kidnaps Margot and declares his love for her. To her surprise, Margot&#x27;s mysterious abductor treats her with every Western consideration. Benny and Susan are captured too. When the Red Shadow comes face to face with General Birabeau, the old man challenges the rebel leader to a duel. Of course Pierre will not kill his own father, so he refuses to fight, losing the respect of the Riffs. Azuri, a sinuous and secretive native dancing girl, who knows the secret of the Red Shadow&#x27;s true identity, might be persuaded to reveal the information if she could capture the attention of Captain Fontaine. Eventually, the Red Shadow&#x27;s identity is discovered, a deal is struck with the Riffs, and Pierre and Margot live happily ever after.

Early versions of the show also included &quot;Dreaming In Paradise&quot;, &quot;Ali-Up&quot;, and &quot;Love&#x27;s Dear Yearning&quot;. A couple of Romberg&#x27;s songs like &quot;It&quot; with comic lyrics by Edward Smith referencing Elinor Glyn were interpolated.

Two songs from &quot;The Desert Song&quot; are among the operetta and Broadway musical songs lampooned in the 1959 musical &quot;Little Mary Sunshine&quot;. &quot;The Riff Song&quot; and &quot;The Desert Song&quot; are the respective targets of &quot;The Forest Rangers&quot; (it also parodies several other &quot;gallant warriors&quot; songs, such as &quot;Stout-Hearted Men&quot;). &quot;The Desert Song,&quot; a hero-sings-to-heroine waltz, is parodied by &quot;You&#x27;re the Fairest Flower,&quot; another hero-sings-to-heroine waltz.

==Recordings==

No original Broadway cast recording was made, but the 1927 London cast recorded eight selections for EMI. These 78-RPM records have been transferred to CD on the Pearl Label. Decca made an album in 1944 with Kitty Carlisle, Felix Knight and Wilbur Evans, covering 10 selections from the score. This was released on CD, paired with &quot;The New Moon&quot;. Earl Wrightson starred in Al Goodman&#x27;s 1948 recording for RCA Victor. This has not been released on CD.

A more complete recording starring Nelson Eddy was made by Columbia Records in 1953. This was the preferred recording of this score on LP until the end of the vinyl era. It was re-released on compact disc. Around the same time, Gordon MacRae and Lucille Norman recorded a 10-inch LP of the score for Capitol [L-351], which was reissued on 12-inch LPs in 1968 [MFP-1184 (UK)] and re-released on CD in 2010 [Hallmark 707902]. This recording is also available on CD paired with &quot;Roberta&quot;. Kathryn Grayson recorded selections with Tony Martin on a 10-inch record for RCA Victor in 1952. A mostly complete 1958 studio cast album with Giorgio Tozzi and Kathy Barr, conducted by Lehman Engel, was released by RCA Victor and is available on CD. A 1959 British studio cast album stars Edmund Hockeridge and June Bronhill. It has also been reissued on CD. Victor also recorded Mario Lanza in highlights from the score. Released in 1959 shortly after the singer&#x27;s death, it became one of his best-selling LPs and is available on CD, paired with &quot;The Student Prince&quot;.

In 1963 as part of a series of stereo recordings of classic operettas, Capitol released a recording of the score with MacRae and Dorothy Kirsten. Most of it can be heard on the 1990 EMI CD &quot;Music of Sigmund Romberg&quot;, along with selections from &quot;The Student Prince&quot; and &quot;The New Moon&quot;. Also in 1963, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; included a selection in their album &quot;A Treasury of Great Operettas&quot;. Artists included Anna Moffo and William Lewis. This stereo recording is also available on CD.

<doc id="622942" wikidata="Q415752" url="?curid=622942" title="Pergolide">
<text>Pergolide, sold under the brand name Permax and Prascend (veterinary) among others, is an ergoline-based dopamine receptor agonist used in some countries for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Parkinson&#x27;s disease is associated with reduced dopamine synthesis in the substantia nigra of the brain. Pergolide acts on many of the same receptors as dopamine to increase receptor activity.
It was patented in 1978 and approved for medical use in 1989. In 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use after several published studies revealed a link between the drug and increased rates of valvular heart disease. However, a veterinary form of pergolide, marketed under the trade name Prascend, is permitted for the treatment of pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) also known as equine Cushing&#x27;s syndrome (ECS) in horses.

==Medical uses==
Pergolide is no longer available for use by humans in the United States, however, it is still used in various other countries, where it is used to treat various conditions including Parkinson&#x27;s disease, hyperprolactinemia, and restless leg syndrome.

Pergolide is available for veterinary use. Under the trade name Prascend, manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim, it is commonly used for the treatment of pituitary hyperplasia at the pars intermedia or Equine Cushing&#x27;s Syndrome (ECS) in horses.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Pergolide acts as an agonist of dopamine D2 and D1 and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It may possess agonist activity at other dopamine receptor subtypes as well, similar to cabergoline. Although pergolide is more potent as an agonist of the D2 receptor, it has high D1 receptor affinity and is one of the most potent D1 receptor agonists of the dopamine receptor agonists that are clinically available. The agonist activity of pergolide at the D1 receptor somewhat alters its clinical and side effect profile in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Pergolide has been said to be hallucinogenic due to activation of 5-HT2A receptors. However, other sources have stated that the drug is non-hallucinogenic. It has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy due to activation of 5-HT2B receptors.

==Side effects==
The drug is in decreasing use, as it was reported in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called cardiac fibrosis. In 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage. Pergolide is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide&#x27;s action at the 5-HT2B serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as ergotamine, methysergide, fenfluramine, and other serotonin 5-HT2B agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in carcinoid syndrome. Pergolide can rarely cause Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, cabergoline, but not lisuride, exhibit this same type of serotonin receptor binding. In January 2007, cabergoline (Dostinex) was also reported to be associated with valvular proliferation heart damage. In March 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use due to serious valvular damage that was shown in two independent studies.

Pergolide has also been shown to impair associative learning.

===Addictive behaviors===
At least one British pergolide user has attracted some media attention with claims that it has caused him to develop a gambling addiction. In June 2010, it was reported that more than 100 Australian users of the drug are suing the manufacturer over both gambling and sex addiction problems they claim are the result of the drug&#x27;s side effects.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Brand names of pergolide include Permax and Prascend (veterinary), among others.

==Research==
Pergolide has been studied in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in one small study but was found to be ineffective.

<text>OpenSSI is an open-source single-system image clustering system. It allows a collection of computers to be treated as one large system, allowing applications running on any one machine access to the resources of all the machines in the cluster.

OpenSSI is based on the Linux operating system and was released as an open source project by Compaq in 2001.
It is the final stage of a long process of development, stretching back to LOCUS, developed in the early 1980s.

==Description==
OpenSSI allows a cluster of individual computers (&quot;nodes&quot;) to be treated as one large system. Processes run on any node have full access to the resources of all nodes. Processes can be migrated from node to node automatically to balance system utilization. Inbound network connections can be directed to the least loaded node available.

OpenSSI is designed to be used for both high performance and high availability clusters. It is possible to create an OpenSSI cluster with no single point of failure, for example the file system can be mirrored between two nodes, so if one node crashes the process accessing the file will &quot;fail over&quot; to the other node. Alternatively the cluster can be designed in such a manner that every node has direct access to the file system.

==Features==

===Single process space===
OpenSSI provides a single process space – every process is visible from every node, and can be managed from any node using the normal Linux commands (ps, kill, renice and so on). The Linux /proc virtual filesystem shows all running processes on all nodes.

The implementation of the single process space is accomplished using the VPROC abstraction invented by Locus for the OSF/1 AD operating system.

===Migration===
OpenSSI allows migration of running processes between nodes. When running processes are migrated they continue to have access to any open files, IPC objects or network connections.

Processes can be &quot;manually&quot; migrated, either by the process calling the special OpenSSI &quot;migrate(2)&quot; system call, or by writing a node number to a special file in the processes /proc directory.

Processes may also, if the user wants, be automatically migrated in order to balance load across the cluster. OpenSSI uses an algorithm developed by the MOSIX project for determining the load on each node.

===Single root===
OpenSSI provides a single root for the cluster - from any node the same files and directories are available. OpenSSI uses several mechanisms to provide the single root – CFS (the OpenSSI Cluster File System), SAN cluster filesystems and parallel mounts of network file systems.

OpenSSI uses the context dependent symbolic link (CDSL) feature, inspired by HP&#x27;s TruCluster system, to allow access to node-specific files in a manner transparent to non cluster-aware applications. A CDSL may point to different files on each node in the cluster.

====CFS====
CFS, the OpenSSI Cluster File System provides transparent inter-node access to an underlying &quot;real&quot; file system on one node.

CFS is &quot;stacked&quot; on top of the real file system and co-ordinates access from different nodes using a &quot;token&quot; mechanism. One node has physical access to the underlying file system and performs all read and write operations. At any one time one node &quot;owns&quot; a token, representing a part of the underlying file, this implies that that part of the file is in the cache of the owning node. If another node tries to access that part of the file the token is &quot;stolen&quot; and the cache contents are copied to the stealing node. The OpenSSI CFS implementation is remarkably similar to that used by HP TruCluster.

CFS is also used to co-ordinate access to shared memory segments.

CFS can be used in a fault tolerant system by using shared disk subsystems (dual ported SCSI or SAN), or by using DRBD. If the node that is currently directly accessing the file system crashes then the CFS mount &quot;fails over&quot; to the other node that is directly connected to the disk and the cluster now accesses the file system via that node.

====SAN clustered file systems====
OpenSSI can use SAN based clustered file systems for its root provided they provide a POSIX compatible file system interface. Lustre and Global File System have been tested, too.

With a clustered file system, each node mounts the file system in parallel and access to the files goes directly from the node to the file system.

====NFS====
OpenSSI mounts NFS files systems in parallel on each node. Every node accesses the NFS server directly.

===Single I/O space===
OpenSSI provides cluster-wide access to all I/O devices on the system, with some limitations - it is not possible for a node to mount a block device from another node.

The udev device manager is used to manage the /dev directory. Each node runs its own copy of udev to create the appropriate device nodes in a subdirectory of /dev, /dev/1 for node 1, /dev/2 for node 2 and so on.

===Single IPC space===
OpenSSI provides internode access to all the standard Linux inter-process communication mechanisms, shared memory, semaphores, SYSV message queues, pipes and Unix domain sockets.

In order to implement cluster wide shared memory – distributed shared memory – OpenSSI uses the CFS &quot;token&quot; system. At any one time a memory segment may be readable by one or more nodes, or writable by one node. If a node without write access to a segment tries to write then the segment is marked unreadable on all other nodes and writable on the current node. If a node without read access tries to read a segment then the current value is copied from a node where it was valid and if it was writable it is marked readable.

===Cluster IP address===
OpenSSI uses LVS to provide fault-tolerant load balanced IP services. Inbound network connections are received by a &quot;director&quot; node which redirects them to the least loaded server node. (A node may be both a director and server). In the event of director node failure another director node takes over and the system continues to accept inbound connections.

==Distributions==
The OpenSSI software is available for various Linux distributions. The OpenSSI kernel is distribution independent but various distribution specific Linux user level systems need to be modified, for example the init process and the system startup scripts.

In 2010 the most recent supported Linux distributions were:

# Fedora Core 3
# Debian Sarge

Since 2008, work was in progress to port OpenSSI to Debian Etch and Lenny distributions.

==History==
The origins of &quot;OpenSSI&quot; date back to the early 1980s, when the &quot;LOCUS&quot; distributed operating system was developed at UCLA. The group that created ″LOCUS″ went on to form the Locus Computing Corporation in 1982, and produced versions of the technology derived from it under several names. In the mid-1990s, this work culminated in the UnixWare NonStop Clusters product at Tandem Computers, which by 1995 took over the team of the former Locus CC and rights to the technology. Compaq would purchase Tandem Computers in 1997. 
The &quot;NonStop Clusters&quot; were commercialized by Santa Cruz Operation as an add-on for UnixWare. When SCO Group stopped selling the product, the developers (brought in by the Tandem acquisition and now working at Compaq) ported the ″NonStop Clusters″ code to Linux and in 2001, now called OpenSSI, released it as open source. Employees continued development for some time after Compaq being acquired by Hewlett-Packard (which happened in 2002). Over the next decade OpenSSI was enhanced by independent contributors.

<text>Michel Giacobini (1873–1938) was a French astronomer.

He discovered a number of comets, including 21P/Giacobini-Zinner (parent body of the Giacobinids meteor shower), 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak, and 205P/Giacobini. The latter he had discovered at Nice on 4 September 1896, but it was not seen on its return, a little less than 7 years later, and was considered a lost comet and consequently designated D/1896 R2. On 10 September 2008, amateur supernova hunters Koichi Itagaki and Hiroshi Kaneda rediscovered it, on its seventeenth return.

He won the Lalande Prize in 1900 and worked at the Nice Observatory until 1910, when he requested a transfer to the Paris Observatory. He was awarded the Valz Prize by the French Academy of Sciences in both 1905 and 1908.

In 1903, Giacobinin received the Prix Jules Janssen, the highest award of the Société astronomique de France, the French astronomical society.

He volunteered for military service in World War I and suffered the effects of poison gas. He recovered and resumed his astronomical activities after the war.

== History ==
The charity was founded in 1950 as World Vision Inc. by Robert Pierce, Kyung-Chik Han and Frank Phillips. It was founded after Pierce was invited to Korea by Han to speak at Young Nak Church, followed by another speech in Seoul. After the breakout of the Korean War weeks later, Pierce and Han continued to collaborate on relief efforts in the region. The first World Vision office opened later that year in Portland, Oregon, with a second office following in 1954 in Korea. During the early years, the charity operated as a missionary service organization meeting emergency needs in crisis areas in East Asia. World Vision operated as a missionary service organisation meeting emergency needs of children in crisis areas in East Asia following the Korean War.

In 1967, the Mission Advanced Research and Communication Center (MARC) was founded by Ed Dayton as a division of World Vision. It became the organizational backbone of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, collected and published data about &quot;unreached people&quot; and also published the &quot;Mission Handbook: North American Protestant Ministries Overseas&quot;.

During the 1970s, World Vision began training families in the agricultural skills necessary to build small farms, with the aim of promoting long term improvement and self-reliance in the communities. The organization also began installing water pumps for clean water, which caused infant mortality rates to drop. Volunteers now use the fresh water to teach gardening and irrigation and promote good health.

In order to restructure, the organization World Vision International was founded in 1977 by Walter Stanley Mooneyham the then president of World Vision. In 1979, World Vision also co-founded the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association.

During the 1990s, World Vision International began focusing on the needs of children who had been orphaned in Uganda, Romania, and Somalia in response to AIDS, neglect, and civil war, respectively. World Vision began working with communities, health providers, faith-based organisations and people living with HIV and AIDS to encourage an end to stigmatisation, better understanding of HIV prevention and community care for those living with AIDS, and orphans left behind by the pandemic. They also joined the United Nations peacekeeping efforts to help those affected by civil war. World Vision also started to openly promote the international ban on land mines. In 1994 World Vision US moved to Washington State. In 2004, the political weekly &quot;Tehelka&quot; newspaper in India criticised World Vision India for its involvement with AD2000.

In 2022, WVI operated in more than 100 countries and had over 33,000 employees.

==Organizational structure==
The World Vision Partnership operates as a federation of interdependent national offices governed by a commitment to common standards and values on fundamental issues. World Vision International provides the global oversight and sets global standards, and is the operating entity in some countries. In other countries, World Vision operates through a locally incorporated NGO, with a local board of directors. Most of the workforce in each country are citizens of that given territory.
World Vision International’s board of directors oversees the World Vision partnership. The full board meets twice a year to appoint senior officers, approve strategic plans and budgets, and determine international policy. The current chairperson of the international board is Ivan Satyavrata. The international president is Andrew Morley. From 2021 onwards, Morley served as Chair of the Steering Committee for Humanitarian Response (SCHR), and is a member of the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC).

===Partners===
World Vision partners include governments, civil society organisations, faith communities, faith-based organisations, businesses, academia, and others. The organization has thousands of partners located around the world.

Some of those who work with World Vision globally include the European Union, Unicef, Global Partnership to End Violence, Joining Forces, World Bank, World Health Organization, World Food Programme, Inter Agency Standing Committee, International Food Policy Research Institute, and Joining Forces for Last Mile Nutrition.

==Beliefs==
World Vision&#x27;s staff comes from a range of Christian denominations. Its staff includes followers of Protestantism, Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. Around the world its staff includes followers of different religions or none. Some staff participate in religious services provided by WVI. They stress that one can be a Christian in any culture. However, World Vision also respects other religions that it encounters, stating that &quot;to promote a secular approach to life would be an insult to them&quot;. Richard Stearns, president of World Vision US, stated that World Vision has a strict policy against proselytizing, which he describes as &quot;using any kind of coercion or inducement to listen to a religious message before helping someone&quot;.

The World Vision Partnership and all of its national members are committed to the concept of transformational development, which is cast in a biblical framework and which is seen as a witness to the love of God for all humanity.

==Programs==

Activities include: emergency relief, education, health care, economic development, advocacy, water/sanitation, food distribution and promotion of justice. The organization has consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council and partnerships with UN agencies like UNICEF, WHO, UNHCR and ILO.

It also addresses factors that perpetuate poverty by what it describes as promoting justice. It supports community awareness of the collective ability to address unjust practices and begin working for change. It claims to speak out on issues such as child labor, debt relief for poor nations, and the use of children as combatants in armed conflict. World Vision International has endorsed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It claims to foster opportunities to help reduce conflict levels and to contribute to the peaceful resolution of hostilities and reconciliation of disputes.

World Vision encourages public awareness about the needs of others, the causes of poverty, and the nature of compassionate response. These efforts include collaboration with media and community participation in fundraising. In areas of the world that are considered too dangerous for news organizations to send their crews, World Vision&#x27;s own videographers supply newscasters with footage of events from these areas. In its communications, the organization claims to uphold the dignity of children and families in presenting explanations of the causes and consequences of poverty, neglect, abuse and war.

World Vision operates in Rwanda since 1994, following the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. In 2023, through 24 programs it helps 1.9 Million people all over the country. Between 2010 and 2017, World Vision Rwanda was averaging nearly US$35 million budget annually, said George Gitau, former country director. 

In 2015, World Vision took part in operations to bring earthquake relief to Nepal. It was also involved in running a child sponsorship program bringing aid to needy children in the wake of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

==Criticism==
After his resignation from the post of president, its founder Robert Pierce criticized the organization for its professionalization at the expense of its evangelical faith and founded Samaritan&#x27;s Purse in 1970.

===Accusations of misrepresentation===

Some donors to World Vision&#x27;s Sponsor a Child-type fundraising have reported feeling misled by the group&#x27;s use of such funding for community rather than individual-specific projects. In a 2008 report on famine in Ethiopia, reporter Andrew Geoghegan, from Australian TV programme &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;, visited his 14-year-old sponsor child. The girl has &quot;been part of a World Vision program all her life&quot; yet says (in translated subtitle) &quot;Until recently, I didn&#x27;t know I had a sponsor.&quot; And when asked about her knowledge of World Vision sponsorship says, &quot;Last time they gave me this jacket and a pen.&quot; Geoghegan was disconcerted to find that despite being &quot;told by World Vision that [the girl] was learning English at school, and was improving ... she speaks no English at all&quot;.

In response, World Vision stated that &quot;it unapologetically takes a community-based approach to development&quot;, in which the money is not directly provided to the family of the sponsored child. The organization argued that the &quot;direct benefit&quot; approach would result in jealousy among other community members without children and would not work. &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; replied to World Vision concerning child sponsorship, showing contradictions between the organization&#x27;s literature that creates the impression that donated money goes directly to the sponsor child and evidence of cases where supposedly sponsored children received little if any benefit.

===Israel and Palestine===
In 1982, after World Vision publicly criticized Israel&#x27;s actions in Palestinian refugee camps near Sidon and Tyre, it came under attack from conservative evangelicals and the government of Israel. In spite of this pressure, World Vision president Mooneyham presented to the eight hundred thousand readers of &quot;World Vision Magazine&quot; a report &quot;showing 255 bodies and ankle-deep body fluids left in a school basement by an Israeli bomb.&quot; In the September 1982 issue of &quot;World Vision Magazine&quot; President Stanley Mooneyham was quoted describing Israeli actions with the behavior of Hitler&#x27;s army, &quot;reminiscent of Warsaw&quot;. In the same month Mooneyham was forced to resign when, according to former World Vision employee Ken Waters, his leadership style was criticized; he was replaced as President by Ted Engstrom.

On June 15, 2016, Mohammad El Halabi, manager of World Vision in Gaza, was arrested at the Erez border crossing and charged by Israeli prosecutors with channeling funds to Hamas. Halabi&#x27;s lawyer said his client had nothing to do with Hamas and that the fact that the investigation had lasted 55 days proved that there was a problem with evidence. The charity stood by Halabi, stating that he was a humanitarian.

<doc id="622962" wikidata="Q2738026" url="?curid=622962" title="Single system image">
<text>In distributed computing, a single system image (SSI) cluster is a cluster of machines that appears to be one single system. The concept is often considered synonymous with that of a distributed operating system, but a single image may be presented for more limited purposes, just job scheduling for instance, which may be achieved by means of an additional layer of software over conventional operating system images running on each node. The interest in SSI clusters is based on the perception that they may be simpler to use and administer than more specialized clusters.

Different SSI systems may provide a more or less complete illusion of a single system.

==Features of SSI clustering systems==

Different SSI systems may, depending on their intended usage, provide some subset of these features.

===Process migration===

Many SSI systems provide process migration.
Processes may start on one node and be moved to another node, possibly for resource balancing or administrative reasons. As processes are moved from one node to another, other associated resources (for example IPC resources) may be moved with them.

===Process checkpointing===
Some SSI systems allow checkpointing of running processes, allowing their current state to be saved and reloaded at a later date.
Checkpointing can be seen as related to migration, as migrating a process from one node to another can be implemented by first checkpointing the process, then restarting it on another node. Alternatively checkpointing can be considered as &quot;migration to disk&quot;.

===Single process space===
Some SSI systems provide the illusion that all processes are running on the same machine - the process management tools (e.g. &quot;ps&quot;, &quot;kill&quot; on Unix like systems) operate on all processes in the cluster.

===Single root===
Most SSI systems provide a single view of the file system. This may be achieved by a simple NFS server, shared disk devices or even file replication.

The advantage of a single root view is that processes may be run on any available node and access needed files with no special precautions. If the cluster implements process migration a single root view enables direct accesses to the files from the node where the process is currently running.

Some SSI systems provide a way of &quot;breaking the illusion&quot;, having some node-specific files even in a single root. HP TruCluster provides a &quot;context dependent symbolic link&quot; (CDSL) which points to different files depending on the node that accesses it. HP VMScluster provides a search list logical name with node specific files occluding cluster shared files where necessary. This capability may be necessary to deal with &quot;heterogeneous&quot; clusters, where not all nodes have the same configuration. In more complex configurations such as multiple nodes of multiple architectures over multiple sites, several local disks may combine to form the logical single root.

===Single I/O space===
Some SSI systems allow all nodes to access the I/O devices (e.g. tapes, disks, serial lines and so on) of other nodes. There may be some restrictions on the kinds of accesses allowed (For example, OpenSSI can&#x27;t mount disk devices from one node on another node).

===Single IPC space===
Some SSI systems allow processes on different nodes to communicate using inter-process communications mechanisms as if they were running on the same machine. On some SSI systems this can even include shared memory (can be emulated in software with distributed shared memory).

In most cases inter-node IPC will be slower than IPC on the same machine, possibly drastically slower for shared memory. Some SSI clusters include special hardware to reduce this slowdown.

===Cluster IP address===
Some SSI systems provide a &quot;cluster IP address&quot;, a single address visible from outside the cluster that can be used to contact the cluster as if it were one machine. This can be used for load balancing inbound calls to the cluster, directing them to lightly loaded nodes, or for redundancy, moving the cluster address from one machine to another as nodes join or leave the cluster.

==Examples==

Examples here vary from commercial platforms with scaling capabilities, to packages/frameworks for creating distributed systems, as well as those that actually implement a single system image.

<doc id="622966" wikidata="Q5178830" url="?curid=622966" title="Cousin problems">
<text>In mathematics, the Cousin problems are two questions in several complex variables, concerning the existence of meromorphic functions that are specified in terms of local data. They were introduced in special cases by Pierre Cousin in 1895. They are now posed, and solved, for any complex manifold &quot;M&quot;, in terms of conditions on &quot;M&quot;.

For both problems, an open cover of &quot;M&quot; by sets &quot;Ui&quot; is given, along with a meromorphic function &quot;fi&quot; on each &quot;Ui&quot;.

==First Cousin problem==
The first Cousin problem or additive Cousin problem assumes that each difference

:formula_1

is a holomorphic function, where it is defined. It asks for a meromorphic function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot; such that

:formula_2

is &quot;holomorphic&quot; on &quot;Ui&quot;; in other words, that &quot;f&quot; shares the singular behaviour of the given local function. The given condition on the formula_1 is evidently &quot;necessary&quot; for this; so the problem amounts to asking if it is sufficient. The case of one variable is the Mittag-Leffler theorem on prescribing poles, when &quot;M&quot; is an open subset of the complex plane. Riemann surface theory shows that some restriction on &quot;M&quot; will be required. The problem can always be solved on a Stein manifold.

The first Cousin problem may be understood in terms of sheaf cohomology as follows. Let K be the sheaf of meromorphic functions and O the sheaf of holomorphic functions on &quot;M&quot;. A global section formula_4 of K passes to a global section formula_5 of the quotient sheaf K/O. The converse question is the first Cousin problem: given a global section of K/O, is there a global section of K from which it arises? The problem is thus to characterize the image of the map

:formula_6

By the long exact cohomology sequence,

:formula_7

is exact, and so the first Cousin problem is always solvable provided that the first cohomology group &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;,O) vanishes. In particular, by Cartan&#x27;s theorem B, the Cousin problem is always solvable if &quot;M&quot; is a Stein manifold.

==Second Cousin problem==
The second Cousin problem or multiplicative Cousin problem assumes that each ratio

:formula_8

is a non-vanishing holomorphic function, where it is defined. It asks for a meromorphic function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot; such that

:formula_9

is holomorphic and non-vanishing. The second Cousin problem is a multi-dimensional generalization of the Weierstrass theorem on the existence of a holomorphic function of one variable with prescribed zeros.

The attack on this problem by means of taking logarithms, to reduce it to the additive problem, meets an obstruction in the form of the first Chern class (see also exponential sheaf sequence). In terms of sheaf theory, let formula_10 be the sheaf of holomorphic functions that vanish nowhere, and formula_11 the sheaf of meromorphic functions that are not identically zero. These are both then sheaves of abelian groups, and the quotient sheaf formula_12 is well-defined. The multiplicative Cousin problem then seeks to identify the image of quotient map formula_13

:formula_14

The long exact sheaf cohomology sequence associated to the quotient is

:formula_15

so the second Cousin problem is solvable in all cases provided that formula_16 The quotient sheaf formula_12 is the sheaf of germs of Cartier divisors on &quot;M&quot;. The question of whether every global section is generated by a meromorphic function is thus equivalent to determining whether every line bundle on &quot;M&quot; is trivial.

The cohomology group formula_18 for the multiplicative structure on formula_10 can be compared with the cohomology group formula_20 with its additive structure by taking a logarithm. That is, there is an exact sequence of sheaves

:formula_21

where the leftmost sheaf is the locally constant sheaf with fiber formula_22. The obstruction to defining a logarithm at the level of &quot;H&quot;1 is in formula_23, from the long exact cohomology sequence

:formula_24

When &quot;M&quot; is a Stein manifold, the middle arrow is an isomorphism because formula_25 for formula_26 so that a necessary and sufficient condition in that case for the second Cousin problem to be always solvable is that formula_27

<text>HMS &quot;Mohawk&quot; was a of the Royal Navy in service from 1963. She was named after a tribe of Native Americans located in southeast Canada and New York State. &quot;Mohawk&quot; was scrapped in 1983.

==Design and construction==
The Tribal-, or Type 81-class, frigates were developed in the mid-1950s as a General Purpose frigate, capable of use in both anti-submarine and anti-aircraft duties in a full-scale war, while serving for Cold War policing duties in peace-time, in particular to replace the old s serving in the Persian Gulf.

The Tribals were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of . The ship&#x27;s hull had a draught of , with the propeller increasing overall draught to . Displacement was standard and full load. Propulsion was by a single-shaft Combined steam and gas (COSAG) arrangement, effectively half of the powerplant of the s. A single Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler fed steam at and to a geared steam turbine rated at , which could be supplemented by a Metrovick G-6 gas turbine rated at to reach top speed, with the gas turbine also allowing the ship to get underway quickly in an emergency, without having to wait to raise steam. Speed was about using both steam and gas turbine power, and on steam power alone.

The ships were fitted with two QF 4.5-in (113 mm) Mark 5 guns, salvaged from scrapped Second World War destroyers, mounted fore and aft. It was intended to fit two Seacat anti-aircraft missile launchers, but these were not ready in time, and &quot;Gurkha&quot; completed with two 40 mm Bofors guns instead, with Seacat replacing the Bofors guns on refit. For anti-submarine and anti-ship duties, a hangar and flight deck for a single Westland Wasp helicopter was fitted, while a Limbo anti-submarine mortar provided close-in anti-submarine armament. &quot;Mohawk&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on a lattice foremast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 978 navigation radar also fitted. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar. The ship had a crew of 253 officers and other ranks.

&quot;Mohawk&quot; was built by Vickers, of Barrow-in-Furness, at a cost of £4,705,000. She was laid down on 23 December 1960, was launched on 5 April 1962 and commissioned on 29 November 1963. Her construction had been disrupted by a labour dispute.

==Operational Service==
In 1965, &quot;Mohawk&quot; deployed to the Persian Gulf. She joined the Beira Patrol, intended to enforce an oil blockade of Rhodesia, in 1966. The following year, &quot;Mohawk&quot; deployed to the West Indies and the Mediterranean, becoming the Gibraltar guardship in 1968. By 1969, &quot;Mohawk&quot; had returned to the West Indies.

&quot;Mohawk&quot; underwent a conversion to accommodate her planned utilisation as a training ship. The refit entailed the removal of &quot;Mohawk&quot;″s aft 4.5-inch gun and the conversion of her hangar to a classroom, but the process was abandoned. In 1973, &quot;Mohawk&quot; and the destroyer relieved the destroyer and frigate in the Far East Squadron. &quot;Mohawk&quot; contributed to the Beira Patrol before returning to Britain in 1973. Later that year she embarked on a tour of the Norwegian coast. She was called onto assist in the search for , a fishing vessel that went missing in the Barents Sea.

In 1974, &quot;Mohawk&quot; served in the West Indies and the Mediterranean. In 1977, &quot;Mohawk&quot; joined Naval On-call Force of the Mediterranean (NAVOCFORMED), a NATO multi-national squadron. Later that year, &quot;Mohawk&quot; formed part of a task force designated &quot;Group 6&quot;, led by the cruiser , that toured the Middle and Far East. During the group&#x27;s return journey the following year, &quot;Mohawk&quot; suffered hull damage in the port of Valletta, Malta after slipping her moorings early.

In 1979, &quot;Mohawk&quot; was reduced to the reserve and allocated to the Standby Squadron. After being placed on the disposal list in 1981. &quot;Mohawk&quot; was sold for scrap and broken up at Cairnryan.

<doc id="622968" wikidata="Q128506" url="?curid=622968" title="The Jaunt">
<text>&quot;The Jaunt&quot; is a horror short story by Stephen King first published in &quot;The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot; in 1981, and collected in King&#x27;s 1985 collection &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;. The story takes place early in the 24th century, when the technology for teleportation, referred to as &quot;Jaunting&quot;, is commonplace, allowing for instantaneous transportation across enormous distances, even to other planets in the Solar System. But the process is very specific, and has dire consequences if it goes wrong. The term &quot;Jaunting&quot; is stated within the short story to be an homage to &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;, a science fiction novel by Alfred Bester.

== Plot ==
In the distant future, humans have developed a form of instantaneous teleportation called &quot;the Jaunt&quot;, enabling colonization of the Solar System. Mark Oates and his family are preparing to travel to Mars for a two-year business trip. As the Jaunting service prepares the other passengers, Mark entertains his two children by recounting a semi-apocryphal tale of the discovery and history of the Jaunt. He explains how in 1987 a scientist named Victor Carune inadvertently discovered the ability to Jaunt after years of research when he accidentally teleported two of his own fingers. Although the procedure functioned perfectly when he tested inorganic objects, Carune discovered a side-effect on the mice sent through his two portals. The mice would either die instantly or behave erratically before dying moments later. He eventually discovered that beings of higher neural activity, such as animals and humans, could only survive the Jaunt while unconscious. Mark explains that this is why all people must undergo general anaesthesia before Jaunting. 

Mark spares his children a gruesome account of the first conscious human to experience the Jaunt, a condemned death-row murderer named Rudy Foggia who had been promised a full pardon upon taking part in the experiment. After six other inmates were Jaunted under the effects of anesthesia, Foggia emerged insane, screaming that the Jaunt was an &quot;eternity&quot; before dying of a heart attack. Mark also omits mention of the 30 people who have Jaunted while conscious, voluntarily or otherwise. Each time, they either died instantly or emerged insane. Scientists had come to conclude that while Jaunting is physically carried out almost instantly, to a conscious mind it lasts an indeterminately long amount of time, perhaps millions of years, leading to a conscious person simply being left alone with their thoughts in an endless field of white. However, Mark attempts to present this fact in a gentle way as to not frighten his children or his wife as, unlike him, they are Jaunting for the first time.

After Mark finishes his story, the family is subjected to sleeping gas and Jaunted to Mars. Upon awakening, Mark is horrified to find that his son Ricky deliberately held his breath while being administered the anesthesia to experience the Jaunt while conscious and has been rendered completely insane. Ricky shrieks that Mark has no comprehension of how long he had been there, screaming “Longer than you think! Longer than you think!” and begins gouging his own eyes out as he is wheeled away from his horrified family by several attendants.

== Television adaptation == 
In 2015, it was announced that the story was set for a film adaptation by Andy Muschietti before he opted to realise King&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; instead.

As of January 2021, the story is due to be made into a television series for MRC by &quot;Fear The Walking Dead&quot; co-creator Dave Erickson.

<doc id="622970" wikidata="Q920253" url="?curid=622970" title="Grasmere (village)">
<text>Grasmere is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Lakes, in the Westmorland and Furness district of Cumbria, England, and situated in the centre of the Lake District and named after its adjacent lake. Grasmere lies within the historic county of Westmorland. The Ambleside and Grasmere ward had an estimated population of 4,592 in 2019. William and Dorothy Wordsworth, the &#x27;Lake Poets&#x27;, lived in Grasmere for 14 years and called it &quot;the loveliest spot that man hath ever found.&quot;

==Etymology==
One possibility is &quot;the lake (mere) flanked by grass.&quot; Although early spellings with &quot;Grys-&quot; or &quot;Gris(s)-&quot; might suggest Old Norse &quot;griss&quot;, meaning &quot;young pig&quot; as the first element, evidence points to the Old English/Old Norse &quot;gres&quot;, meaning grass, with the modern form influenced by Standard English. The medial &quot;-s(s)e-&quot; may, as suggested by Ekwall, point to the Old Norse &quot;gres-saer&quot; or &quot;grass-lake&quot; as the original name. The element &quot;mere&quot; refers to a still extant word meaning &quot;lake&quot; or &quot;pool&quot;.

==Geography==
The village is on the River Rothay, which flows into Grasmere lake about ⅓ mile (500 metres) to the south. The village is overlooked from the north-west by the rocky hill of Helm Crag, popularly known as &quot;The Lion and the Lamb&quot; or the &quot;Old Lady at the organ&quot;. These names derive from the shape of rock formations on its summit, depending on the side from which it is viewed.

The several walks that begin in the village include the ascent of Helm Crag, a longer route up to Fairfield, and a moderate 600&#x27; (200-metre) ascent to Easedale Tarn. The village is also on the route of Alfred Wainwright&#x27;s Coast to Coast Walk.
The main A591 road connects Grasmere to the Vale of Keswick over Dunmail Raise to the north, and to Ambleside to the south. In other directions, Grasmere is surrounded by high ground. (At Christmas 2015, the A591 was washed away on the Keswick side of Dunmail Raise, causing traffic to make a long detour. It reopened in May 2016.) To the west, a long ridge comes down from High Raise and contains the lesser heights of Blea Rigg and Silver How. To the east, Grasmere is bordered by the western ridge of the Fairfield horseshoe.

==Transport==
Grasmere lies on the main A591 road between Keswick and Kendal.

The town is well-connected by public transport, primarily served by the Stagecoach 555 bus service. This service links Grasmere with various towns, including Keswick, Ambleside, Kendal, and Lancaster. Additionally, Stagecoach operates an open-top bus service, known as the 599 or &#x27;Lakesider,&#x27; providing a scenic journey connecting Ambleside, Bowness-on-Windermere, and occasionally Kendal.

The nearest railway station is Windermere, located 9 miles (14 kilometres) away; both bus routes provide direct access to and from the station.

==Community events==
===Rushbearing===
Grasmere&#x27;s Rushbearing Ceremony, centred on St Oswald&#x27;s Church, has ancient origins. The present-day ceremony is an annual event which features a procession through the village with bearings made from rushes and flowers. In this procession there are also six Maids of Honour, a brass band, the church choir, and others carrying their own decorated rush-bearing.
===Sports===
The annual Grasmere Sports in August were first held in 1852. Participants compete in a variety of sports, including Cumberland wrestling, fell running and hound trails (similar to drag hunting).

===Sweetmeats===
Grasmere Gingerbread is made to a &quot;secret recipe&quot; popularised by Sarah Nelson (1815–1904). By the early 19th century, Grasmere gingerbread was being sold as fairings and as a popular seller in its own right. Poet Dorothy Wordsworth wrote in 1803 that she and her brother William craved the gingerbread.

Grasmere contains the winner of the &quot;Get Started Award 2014&quot; awarded by the Institute of Enterprise and Entrepreneurs: the Chocolate Cottage.

===Religious===
Until September 2013, Grasmere&#x27;s three main church parishes (Catholic, Church of England and Methodist) gathered three times a year to celebrate mass in the Catholic Church of Our Lady of the Wayside. Quakers still hold meetings of worship in Grasmere.

===Community Groups===
Grasmere has many thriving community groups, including a branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute which meets regularly.

==Government==
The Lakes were governed by an urban district council, before becoming part of the Lakes Urban District in 1934. The parish was abolished on 1 April 1974 to form Lakes. In 1961 the parish had a population of 1029. Grasmere is part of the Westmorland and Lonsdale parliamentary constituency, and is represented by the Liberal Democrat MP Tim Farron. Grasmere has lost population since the 1960s.

==In Art and Literature==
George Pickering painted many views around Grasmere, and an engraving of one of these, &quot;Grassmere Lake and Village, Westmorland&quot;, was published in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Sketch Book, 1834, accompanied by a humorous sketch by Letitia Elizabeth Landon about a lover of poetry who, given a legacy, buys a property here only to find extraordinary steps would be required to make life bearable.

Lydia Sigourney&#x27;s poem published in &quot;Pleasant Memories of Pleasant Lands&quot;, 1842 records her visit in that year and her reception by Wordsworth.

<text>Trusted Operating System (TOS) generally refers to an operating system that provides sufficient support for multilevel security and evidence of correctness to meet a particular set of government requirements.

The most common set of criteria for trusted operating system design is the Common Criteria combined with the Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for Labeled Security Protection Profile (LSPP) and mandatory access control (MAC). The Common Criteria is the result of a multi-year effort by the governments of the U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands and other countries to develop a harmonized security criteria for IT products.

==Examples==
Examples of certified trusted operating systems are:
* Apple Mac OS X 10.6 (Rated EAL 3+) 
* HP-UX 11i v3 (Rated EAL 4+)
* Some Linux distributions (Rated up to EAL 4+)
* Microsoft Windows 7 and Microsoft Server 2008 R2 (Rated EAL 4+)
* AIX 5L with PitBull Foundation (Rated EAL 4+)
* Trusted Solaris
* Trusted UNICOS 8.0 (Rated B1)
* XTS-400 (Rated EAL5+)
* IBM VM (SP, BSE, HPO, XA, ESA, etc.) with RACF

Examples of operating systems that might be certifiable are:
* FreeBSD with the TrustedBSD extensions 
* SELinux (see FAQ)

Companies that have created trusted operating systems include:
* Addamax (BSD, SVR3, SVR4, HP/UX)
* Argus Systems Group (Solaris, AIX, Linux)
* AT&amp;T (System V)
* BAE Systems (XTS Unix)
* Bull (AIX)
* Data General (DG/UX)
* Digital Equipment Corporation (Ultrix)
* Forcepoint (Hardened SELinux)
* Gemini Computers (GEMSOS)
* General Dynamics C4 Systems (Linux)
* Harris Corporation (SVR3, SVR4)
* Hewlett-Packard (HP/UX)
* Honeywell (Multics)
* IBM (OS/390, AIX)
* SCO (SCO Unix)
* Secure Computing Corporation (LOCK, Mach, BSD)
* SecureWare (Apple A/UX, HP/UX, SCO)

<doc id="622977" wikidata="Q1027041" url="?curid=622977" title="Mercedes, Buenos Aires">
<text>Mercedes () is a city in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. It is located 100 km (62 miles) west from Buenos Aires and 30 km (18 miles) southwest of Luján. It is the administrative headquarters for the district (&quot;partido&quot;) of Mercedes as well as of the judicial district. The Catedral Basílica de Mercedes-Luján, located in the city, is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mercedes-Luján.

Mercedes has a population of 51,967 people (51,5% women, 48,5% men) as per the .

== History ==
Mercedes was first established as a fortress against native indigenous attacks. Its original name was &quot;&quot;La Guardia de Luján&quot; and it was one of several fortress built in the &quot;borders&quot; of Buenos Aires to protect this city and gather the people living in the county near.

It became a town on 25 June 1752 when founded by José de Zárate during a military campaign known as &quot;La Valerosa&quot;. In 1777 viceroy Pedro de Cevallos proposed moving the town, but actually it was moved to its present location by viceroy Juan José de Vértiz on 8 May 1779. When moved its name was changed to &quot;Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes&quot;&quot;.

Mercedes is one of the few towns in Argentina in which three different railways meet, thus been connected with large commercial areas as Buenos Aires as well as the Pacific Ocean, the Andes range and the pampas plains. This was a powerful reason during the 19th century for proposing the city as the capital of Buenos Aires Province. Finally La Plata became capital, but Mercedes became known as the &quot;West Pearl&quot;.

In 1812 the Mercedes Partido was established because of the city&#x27;s increasing population and commercial activities. The first municipal government was elected in 1856. Then-governor of Buenos Aires, Mariano Saavedra, officially named it &quot;Ciudad de Mercedes&quot; in 1865, the same year that railway came to Mercedes for the first time.

== Churches ==
The most important churches in the city are:
* Our Lady of Mercedes Cathedral located on San Martín square, also the location of the italianate &quot;Palacio Municipal&quot; (city hall) and numerous cafés and restaurants. A library founded by President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is located a few streets away. Built in neogothic style and inaugurated on April 16, 1921, in 1934 received &quot;cathedral&quot; status by Pope bull. The Cathedral was declared National Monument of Argentina by a decree signed by president Cristina Fernández in 2010.
* St. Patrick&#x27;s Church: Inaugurated on March 17, 1932 and remodeled in 2003, it has 2,500 m2 and a large number of vitraux, a figure representing St. Patrick among them. This church also has the largest pipe organ in South America, with 4,700 tubes. It was directly brought from Germany. A group of gargoyles (18 in total) decorate the exterior of the church.
* St. Luis Gonzaga Church: designated by architect Pedro Benoit (&#x27;s son), is the oldest in the city, having been inaugurated as a chapel in 1891, after twelve years of construction. The chapel received &quot;church&quot; status in December 1941.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Mercedes has three railway stations, with two of them still active: Mercedes (Sarmiento) is terminus of the Sarmiento Line diesel branch from Moreno and Mercedes (San Martín) is part of the San Martín Railway line where long-distance services are operated by state-owned companies Trenes Argentinos and Ferrobaires to Rufino and Alberdi respectively. The station was originally built by the Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway. Mercedes Sarmiento and San Martín are also located few meters to one another.

The third station is Mercedes (Belgrano), originally built by French-owned Compañía General and inactive since the 1970s. That station is far from the city&#x27;s commercial area.

Railway stations with the name &quot;Mercedes&quot; are:

Notes:
* 1 &quot;The building is currently occupied by several non-profit associations.&quot;

=== Road ===
Mercedes can be reached from the city of Buenos Aires by the &quot;Acceso Oeste&quot; and then by National Route 5 until km. 100. From the city of Lobos by Provincial Route 41 to the north (80-km length) and from Chivilcoy by Route 5 to the northwest. The city can also be reached from San Antonio de Areco after completing 50 km-length (31 km) by Provincial Route 41.

Mercedes has a bus terminal, located near the Mercedes (Sarmiento) railway station.

==Geography==

===Location===
The city of Mercedes is 34° 39&#x27;south latitude and 59° 25&#x27; west longitude, along the Luján River. It is 35 km (30 min by car) from the city of Luján, one of the most important religious center and pilgrimage of Argentina; 100 km (62 mi) from Buenos Aires and, 152 km (94 mi) from La Plata, capital of the province.

===Climate===
The climate of this region is the Mesopotamian type temperate humid with an annual average of 16 °C (60.8 °F). The winter is mild with average temperatures of 9 °C (48.2 °F), while the summer is mild with an average temperature of 23 °C (73.4 °F).

== Popular culture ==
On the outskirts of Mercedes there is an old &quot;pulpería&quot; or rural bar and store, institutions which enjoy mythical status in gaucho culture. Known as &quot;&quot;lo de Cacho&quot; (Cacho&#x27;s), it claims to be the last pulpería of the Pampas and retains the atmosphere of 1850, the year it opened. There is an original wanted poster for the outlaw Juan Moreira and reminders of gauchos, their culture and knife fights.

There is an old war memorial called &quot;La Cruz de Palo&quot;&quot;. It is a wooden cross remembering where the last of the native attacks to Mercedes took place on 27 October 1823.

Mercedes is known for its peaches and salami, been the venue for the National Peach Fair (&quot;Fiesta Nacional del Durazno&quot;) as well as the National Salami Fair (&quot;Fiesta Nacional del Salame Quintero&quot;). Both fairs have their own queen elected each year.

== Miscellanea ==

Mercedes has been the birthplace of several football players (Lucas Biglia), musicians, writers and journalists. Nevertheless, it is most known as the town where president Héctor José Cámpora was born as well as the military dictator and president Jorge Rafael Videla.

The city was organized by a-hundred-meters-long square blocks (as a Roman castra). The streets are numbered with even numbers from South to North and with odd numbers from East to West. Thus, is really easy to orient, find addresses and calculate distances along the city.

<text>The Meitei people, also known as Meetei people, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group native to the Indian State of Manipur. They form the largest and dominant ethnic group of Manipur in Northeast India. They speak the Meitei language (officially called Manipuri), one of the 22 official languages of the Republic of India and the sole official language of Government of Manipur. 
The Meiteis primarily settled in the Imphal Valley region in modern-day Manipur, though a sizeable population has settled in the other Indian states of Assam, Tripura, Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram. There is also a notable presence of Meiteis in the neighbouring countries of Myanmar and Bangladesh. The Meiteis represents about 53% of Manipur&#x27;s population.

==Endonyms and exonyms==
The Meitei are known by a number of endonyms, &quot;Meitei&quot;, &quot;Meetei&quot;, &quot;Meithei&quot; (Meitei), and as well as by numerous exonyms, such as &quot;Meckley&quot;, &quot;Manipuri&quot;, &quot;Cassay-Shan&quot;, and &quot;Kathe&quot; (Burmese). The term &quot;Manipuri&quot; is widely used, but problematic because of its ambiguous scope: next to being a synonym for &quot;Meitei&quot;/&quot;Meetei&quot;, it can also refer in a wider sense to the native ethnic groups in the hills of Manipur.

== Geographical distribution ==

=== India ===

As per the 2011 census, there 1,761,079 Meitei language-speakers in India.

The vast majority of them (1,522,132 people, 86 percent of the total) are in the state of Manipur, which is also their place of origin.
Estimated 239,836 people of this population are Meitei Pangals. The remainder, 1,353,999 people, are ethnic Meiteis.

A significant number (168,133 people, 9.5 percent) of Meitei language speakers are in the state of Assam.
In the Barak Valley region of Assam, Meitei people are the third largest ethnic group, after Bengalis and Hindi speakers.

=== Bangladesh ===
The population of Meiteis are found in four districts of Sylhet Division in Bangladesh, namely Sylhet District (thirteen villages), Moulvibazar District (twenty-eight villages), Sunamganj District (three villages) and Habiganj District (four villages). In early times, there were Meitei population in Dhaka, Mymensingh and Comilla too.

=== Myanmar ===
Myanmar has a significant population of Meitei people in Kachin state, Yangon Region, Sagaing Region, Shan state, Ayeyarwady Region, among others.

== Origins and history ==


The earliest sections of the &quot;Cheitharol Kumbaba&quot;, a Meitei chronicle, record the gradual spread of Meiteis across and their assimilation of other clans into a confederacy.

=== In Kangleipak (Manipur) ===

In 1100 CE, Loyumba Shinyen (), an ancient Meitei language constitution was written and regulated under the supervision of Meitei King Loiyumba (Loyumba) (1074 CE-1112 CE) in the Ancient Kangleipak (early Manipur). It is a formal proclamation of the proto-constitution which was drafted in 429 CE by Meitei King Naophangba. The idea of its constitutionalism was functional until it was substituted by the Manipur State Constitution Act 1947.

=== In Myanmar (Burma) ===

Myanmar is home to a sizeable community of Meiteis, who are called &quot;Kathe&quot; in Burmese. Unlike other Hindu communities in Myanmar, the Meitei resemble other Burmese ethnic groups in terms of physical appearance, which has accelerated their assimilation and integration into Burmese society. In the early 1950s, Burmese Meiteis numbered approximately 40,000, with a third of them residing in Mandalay. Current estimates are approximately 25,000. Meiteis have resettled throughout the country, including in villages near Myitkyina to the north, Homalin, Kalewa, Pyay, in the center of the country, and Yangon to the south. They continue to practice Hinduism in Myanmar.

As a result of wars between the Meitei kingdom and the Konbaung dynasty between the 17th and 18th centuries, many Meiteis were resettled in the Burmese kingdom. Some Meitei settlements in modern-day Myanmar originate from the 1758–1759 war, and from the Burmese occupation of Manipur from 1819 to 1826. Alaungpaya, during the former campaign, resettled Meiteis in Sagaing and Amarapura. The Meitei people&#x27;s horsemanship skills were employed in the Burmese royal army, where they formed the elite Cassay cavalry (ကသည်းမြင်းတပ်) and artillery regiments (ကသည်းအမြောက်တပ်) which were employed during the Burmese–Siamese wars. The Burmese court also retained a retinue of Manipuri Brahmins called Bamons, also called &quot;Kathe Ponna&quot; (ကသည်းပုဏ္ဏား) to advise and conduct court rituals.

== Language and writing systems ==
The Meitei people speak the Meitei language (also known as the Manipuri language), a Tibeto-Burman language. Meitei is one of the languages with legal status in India, and was included in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India in 1992.

There are many Meitei language movements, including classical language movement (predominantly in Manipur), associate official language movement (in Assam), linguistic purism movement (predominantly in Manipur), etc.

Historically and then after a long gap, presently, Meitei was written in the indigenous Meitei mayek script. The script was replaced by an alphabet based on the Bengali script in the early 18th century. The Meitei Mayek script has seen a revival in recent decades, and is now seen in street signs, schools, newspapers, and legislative proceeding records.

=== Literature ===


Among the heritage of diverse literary works in Meitei literature, the &quot;Khamba Thoibi Sheireng&quot;, ), is regarded as the national epic of the Manipuris. It is an epic poem based on the ancient romantic adventure tale of Khamba and Thoibi. It is the best known magnum opus of Hijam Anganghal Singh. It is often considered to be the greatest of all the Meitei epic poems. At 39,000 verses, it is the longest Indian epic just after the Mahabharata and the Ramayana.

== Culture ==

=== Architectural designs and sculptures ===

Some of the significant intricate designs of the traditional Meitei architecture and sculptures are seen in various buildings and institutions, especially the temples of traditional Meitei religion: Hiyangthang Lairembi Temple, Pakhangba Temple, Kangla, Sanamahi Kiyong Temple, Thangjing Temple, Moirang, among many. Others include the Ima Keithel, Kangla Sanathong. include Some of the worthy to mention finely crafted sculptures are the Marjing Polo Statue, Kangla Sha sculptures, Statue of Meidingu Nara Singh.

=== Classical and folk dances, festivals and ritualistic theatres ===

The Manipuri classical dance, also referred to as the Manipuri&quot; &quot;Raas Leela (), is a jagoi and is one of the major Indian classical dance forms, originating from the historical Manipur Kingdom.

==== Achievements in the National Film Awards ====
=== Religions and beliefs ===

According to the 2011 census, 222,422 people (14.6 percent) follow the traditional Sanamahi religion of the Meitei people. The remainder (1,298,821 people, 85.3 percent) follow Hinduism and Christianity as per the census. The number of Christians is expected to be small. For example, the valley districts of Manipur, the major concentration of Meitei people, have about 3,000 Christians.

Most Meiteis follow both Hinduism as well as Sanamahi religious traditions and rituals. For example, they worship Sanamahi in the south-west corners of their homes.

=== Calendar ===
The Meitei people follow a traditional calendar called Maliyafam Palcha Kumsing, which has 12 months and a 7-day week.

=== Cuisine ===

Rice, vegetables and fish are staple food of the Meiteis, although meat is also consumed; but in traditional meitei dishes meat is never used in non-vegetarian dishes. In traditional and cultural gatherings fish, snails, oysters, crabs, eels etc. are the only non-vegetarian elements used and a significant number of meiteis follow it where meat is cooked and eaten outside the house if consumed. Rice is the main carbohydrate source in a Meitei dish; typically, it is served with vegetables, fish, freshwater snails, crabs, oyesters, eels etc. Among the most famous species of fishes Manipuri Sareng (Wallago attu) or commonly known as Helicopter catfish, Hilsa (ilish Tenualosa ilisha), freshwater snails (pila (gastropod)) and edible oysters are considered a delicacy. The vegetables are either made as stews (Kangsoi) with less oil/no oil used in sauteing, or stir fried directly in oil with various added spices to make an oily spicy side dish (Kanghou). Roasted/Smoked and Sun-dried fish or fried fresh fish is usually added in most of the stews and curry to impart special taste. The vegetables, herbs and fruits consumed in the region are more similar to those in Southeast/East/Central Asian, Siberian, Arctic, Polynesian and Micronesian cuisines such as Myanmar, Thailand, Inuit, etc. E.g. treebean (yongchak), galangal (loklei), culantro (awa phadigom), lime basil (mayangton), fishwort (tokningkhok) and many others, which are not cultivated in northern India. One of the most important ingredients in Meitei cooking is Ngari (fermented fish). Roasted ngari is used in the singju (a kind of salad), morok metpa (chilli chutney), eromba (boiled and mashed veggies with chillies). A variety of fermented bamboo shoots (soibum) as well as fresh bamboo shoots (Ushoi/Shoidon), and fermented soya beans (hawaijaar) also form an important part of Meitei cuisines. All meals are served with some fresh aromatic herbs on the side.

A typical every day Meitei meal will have rice, vegetable or fish curry, a piquant side dish (either morok metpa or eromba accompanied with herbs), a champhut (a steamed/boiled vegetable with little sugar, e.g., carrot, pumpkin or cucumber slices or steamed/boiled mustard green stems, etc. without sugar), and a Kanghou. Meat cuisines are also popular amongst the Meiteis and some of the common meat curries are yen thongba (chicken curry) and nganu thongba (duck cury) and depending on regions, oak thongba (pork curry) and shan thongba (beef curry).

=== Subsistence ===
The Meitei are mainly agriculturists in which rice is a staple crop. However, they also grow mangoes, lemons, pineapples, oranges, guavas, and other fruits. Fishing is also common among the Meitei that can either be a profession or a hobby. Women tend to dominate the local markets as sellers of food items, textiles, and traditional clothing.

== Associations and organisations ==
===Cultural revivalist organisations===

Arambai Tenggol is a socio-political organisation involved in the revival and preservation of indigenous Meitei culture, which has developed into an armed milita in the course of the 2023–2025 Manipur violence. Meira Paibi (Women torch bearers) is a Meitei women&#x27;s social movement referred to as the &quot;guardians of civil society&quot;.

<text>Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann (2 June 1802 – 15 January 1841) was a German zoologist and herpetologist born in Braunschweig.

He studied medicine and philology at the University of Leipzig, and afterwards was an assistant to Martin Lichtenstein (1780–1857) in Berlin. In 1828 he became a professor at University of Cologne, and two years later was an extraordinary professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin.

Wiegmann specialized in the study of herpetology and mammalogy. In 1835, he founded, together with other scholars, the zoological periodical &quot;Archiv für Naturgeschichte&quot;, also known as &quot;Wiegmann&#x27;s Archive&quot;. With Johann Friedrich Ruthe (1788–1859) he wrote an important textbook of zoology called &quot;Handbuch der Zoologie&quot;, and in 1834 Wiegmann published &quot;Herpetologia Mexicana&quot;, a monograph on the reptiles of Mexico.

In 1841 he died of tuberculosis at the age of 38 in Berlin.

His father Arend Friedrich Wiegmann (1771–1853) was a German researcher in botany.

==Species described by Wiegmann==
Of the many species of reptiles which he described, 55 species are still considered valid, among which are:

*&quot;Gerrhonotus liocephalus&quot; in 1828
*&quot;Heloderma horridum&quot;, the venomous Mexican beaded lizard, in 1829
*&quot;Pelodiscus sinensis&quot; in 1834
*&quot;Laemanctus longipes&quot; also in 1834
*&quot;Scincus hemprichii&quot; in 1837

He also described several new species of amphibians.

==Species named in honor of Wiegmann==
Wiegmann is commemorated in the scientific names of three species of Reptiles:

*&quot;Liolaemus wiegmannii&quot; 
*&quot;Otocryptis wiegmanni&quot; 
*&quot;Trogonophis wiegmanni&quot;

<doc id="622983" wikidata="Q4230753" url="?curid=622983" title="The End of the Whole Mess">
<text>&quot;The End of the Whole Mess&quot; is a short science fiction story by American writer Stephen King, first published in &quot;Omni Magazine&quot; in 1986. It was collected in King&#x27;s &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; in 1993 and in &quot;&quot; in 2008. The story is written in the form of a personal journal, and tells the story of an attempt to cure humanity&#x27;s aggressive tendencies.

A TV adaptation of the story was produced by TNT as part of &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King&quot; and received positive reviews.

==Plot summary==
The story, narrated by Howard Fornoy in the form of a personal journal, recounts the life of his younger brother, Robert &quot;Bobby&quot; Fornoy. Bobby, a child prodigy whose adult interests led him to study a variety of scientific disciplines, discovered a chemical that reduces the aggressive tendencies of humans and other organisms. While doing sociological research in Texas, Bobby used crime statistics to create a topographic map which displayed a geographical pattern of violent crime. Examining the map, Bobby noted diminishing levels of crime centered on the town of La Plata. When he arrives to investigate, he finds that this town has never had any violent crime. Bobby is ultimately able to determine that the cause of the non-aggression is the presence of a chemical unique to the town&#x27;s water supply. Even minimal exposure to the chemical will calm any angry person or animal. Bobby isolates and reduces the chemical to a concentrated form.

At a time of international chaos suggestive of an approaching nuclear war, Bobby and Howard, by means of a volcano in Borneo that is set to erupt and blow millions of tons of ash into the atmosphere, disperse a large quantity of this substance throughout the world, in the hope of preventing a catastrophe. Indeed, the effects are quick and expected, a massive decrease in hostilities around the globe.

Several months later it is discovered, to the Fornoys&#x27; horror, that there was another quality of La Plata that was not studied until after the substance was released. The chemical does eliminate aggression, and increases calm, but it does the job too well. Over time the compound accumulates in the brain, causing symptoms resembling dementia or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and eventually resulting in death. Howard&#x27;s journal entries after this point include increasing numbers of grammar, spelling, and other mistakes, eventually devolving into incoherence as Howard succumbs to the effects of the chemical. It is implied the human race will eventually die out as humanity becomes unable to care for themselves.

The style of Howard&#x27;s entries near the end are reminiscent of those of the character Charlie in Daniel Keyes&#x27; book &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, and of King&#x27;s own earlier short story, &quot;Survivor Type&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

&quot;The End of the Whole Mess&quot; was included as the fourth installment of TNT&#x27;s &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes: From the Stories of Stephen King,&quot; starring Ron Livingston as Howard and Henry Thomas as Bobby. It originally aired on July 19, 2006. In this version, Howard is an Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker instead of a writer, and he tells his story in front of a video camera. In addition, the events of the September 11 attacks are incorporated into the story and are used as a catalyst for Bobby&#x27;s inspiration. At the end, Bobby and his brother commit suicide by injecting themselves with a concentrate of the aggression-decreasing substance.

Bryan Pope of DVD Verdict rates the television episode an A− and praises the acting. Christopher Noseck of DVD Talk said it is the best episode of the series, both believable and straightforward. Jon Condit of Dread Central rated the episode 4.5/5 stars and wrote, &quot;This is a really touching, character driven, and emotional story.&quot;

The audiobook version of this story was narrated by actor Matthew Broderick.

<text>A compile farm is a server farm, a collection of one or more servers, which has been set up to compile computer programs remotely for various reasons. Uses of a compile farm include:

* &quot;Cross-platform development&quot;: When writing software that runs on multiple processor architectures and operating systems, it can be infeasible for each developer to have their own machine for each architecture — for example, one platform might have an expensive or obscure type of CPU. In this scenario, a compile farm is useful as a tool for developers to build and test their software on a shared server running the target operating system and CPU. Compile farms may be preferable to cross-compilation as cross compilers are often complicated to configure, and in some cases compilation is only possible on the target, making cross-compilation impossible.
* &quot;Cross-platform continuous integration testing&quot;: in this scenario, each server has a different processor architecture or runs a different operating system; scripts automatically build the latest version of a source tree from a version control repository. One of the difficulties of cross-platform development is that a programmer may unintentionally introduce an error that causes the software to stop functioning on a different CPU/OS platform from the one they are using. By using a cross-platform compile farm, such errors can be identified and fixed.
* &quot;Distributed compilation&quot;: Building software packages typically requires operations that can be run in parallel (for example, compiling individual source code files). By using a compile farm, these operations can be run in parallel on separate machines. An example of a program which can be used to do this is distcc.

One example of a compile farm was the service provided by SourceForge until 2006. The SourceForge compile farm was composed of twelve machines of various computer architectures running a variety of operating systems, and was intended to allow developers to test and use their programs on a variety of platforms before releasing them to the public. After a power spike destroyed several of the machines it became non-operational some time in 2006, and was officially discontinued in February 2007.

Other examples are:
* GCC Compile Farm https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm
* OpenSUSE Build Service
* FreeBSD reports service which lets package maintainers test their own changes on a variety of versions and architectures.
* Launchpad Build Farm https://launchpad.net/builders
* Mozilla has a build farm, but it is not public https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering
* Debian has a build farm https://buildd.debian.org/
* OpenCSW build farm for Solaris x86 and Sparc

<text>The Sahrawis, or Sahrawi people ( &quot;&quot;), are an ethnic group native to the western part of the Sahara desert, which includes the Western Sahara, southern Morocco, much of Mauritania, and along the southwestern border of Algeria. They are of mixed Hassani Arab and Sanhaji Berber descent, as well as West African and other indigenous populations.

As with most peoples living in the Sahara, the Sahrawi culture is a mix of Arab and indigenous African elements. Sahrawis are composed of many tribes and are largely speakers of the Hassaniya dialect of Arabic.

== Etymology ==
The Arabic word &#x27; () literally means &quot;Inhabitant of the Desert&quot;. The word Sahrawi is derived from the Arabic word &#x27; (), meaning &quot;desert&quot;. A man is called a Sahrawi, and a woman is called a Sahrawiya. In other languages it is pronounced in similar or different ways:

* Berber: &quot;Aseḥrawi&quot; or &quot;Aneẓrofan&quot; 
* English: &quot;Sahrawi&quot; or &quot;Saharawi&quot;
* Spanish: &quot;Saharaui&quot; (&quot;saharauita&quot;, &quot;saharauiya&quot;)
* French: &quot;Sahraoui&quot;
* Italian: &quot;Saharaui&quot;, &quot;Sahraui&quot;, &quot;Sahrawi&quot; or &quot;Saharawi&quot;
* Portuguese: &quot;Saarauís&quot;
* German: Sahraui(s)

==History==

=== Early history ===
Nomadic Berbers, mainly of the Senhaja / Zenaga tribal confederation, inhabited the areas now known as Western Sahara, southern Morocco, Mauritania and southwestern Algeria, before Islam arrived in the 8th century CE. It is not known when the camel was introduced to the region (probably in the first or second millennium BCE), but it revolutionized the traditional trade routes of North Africa. Berber caravans transported salt, gold, and slaves between North and West Africa, and the control of trade routes became a major ingredient in the constant power struggles between various tribes and sedentary peoples. On more than one occasion, the Berber tribes of present-day Mauritania, Morocco and Western Sahara united behind religious leaders to sweep the surrounding governments from power, then founding principalities, dynasties, or even vast empires of their own. This was the case with the Almoravid dynasty of Morocco and Andalusia, and several emirates in Mauritania.

In the 11th century, the Bedouin tribes of the Beni Hilal and Beni Sulaym emigrated westwards from Egypt to the Maghreb region. In the early 13th century, the Yemeni Maqil tribes migrated westwards across the entirety of Arabia and northern Africa, to finally settle around present-day Morocco. They were badly received by the Zenata Berber descendants of the Merinid dynasty, and among the tribes pushed out of the territory were the Beni Hassan.

This tribe entered the domains of the Sanhaja, and over the following centuries imposed itself upon them, intermixing with the population in the process. Berber attempts to shake off the rule of Arab warrior tribes occurred sporadically, but assimilation gradually won out, and after the failed Char Bouba uprising (1644–74), the Berber tribes virtually without exception embraced Arab or Muslim culture and even claim Arab heritage. The Arabic dialect of the Beni Ḥassān, Hassaniya, remains the mother-tongue of Mauritania and Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara to this day, and is also spoken in southern Morocco and western Algeria, among affiliated tribes. Berber vocabulary and cultural traits remain common, despite the fact that many if not all of the Sahrawi/Moorish tribes today claim Arab ancestry; several are even claiming to be descendants of Muhammad, so-called sharifian tribes.

The modern day Sahrawis are a mixed ethnic group of Arabs, West Africans &amp; diverse Berbers. The people inhabit the westernmost Sahara desert, in the area of modern Mauritania, Morocco, Western Sahara, and parts of Algeria. (Some tribes would also traditionally migrate into northern Mali and Niger, or even further along the Saharan caravan routes.) As with most Saharan peoples, the tribes reflect a highly mixed heritage, combining Arab, and other influences, including ethnic and cultural characteristics found in many ethnic groups of the Sahel. The latter were primarily acquired through mixing with Wolof, Soninke and other populations of the southern Sahel, and through the acquisition of slaves by wealthier nomad families.

In pre-colonial times, the Sahara was generally considered &quot;Blad Essiba&quot; or &quot;the land of dissidence&quot; by the Moroccan central government and Sultan of Morocco in Fez, and by the authorities of the Deys of Algiers. The governments of the pre-colonial Sahelian empires of Mali and Songhai appear to have had a similar relationship with the tribal territories, which were at once the home of undisciplined raiding tribes and the main trade route for the Saharan caravan trade. Central governments had little control over the region, although the Hassaniya tribes would occasionally extend &quot;beya&quot; or allegiance to prestigious rulers, to gain their political backing or, in some cases, as a religious ceremony. The Moorish populations of what is today northern Mauritania established a number of emirates, claiming the loyalty of several different tribes and through them exercising semi-sovereignty over traditional grazing lands. This could be considered the closest thing to centralized government that was ever achieved by the Hassaniya tribes, but even these emirates were weak, conflict-ridden and rested more on the willing consent of the subject tribes than on any capacity to enforce loyalty.

=== European colonialism ===
Modern distinctions drawn between the various Hassaniya-speaking Sahrawi-Moorish groups are primarily political, but cultural differences dating from different colonial and post-colonial histories are also apparent. An important divider is whether the tribal confederations fell under French or Spanish colonial rule. France conquered most of North and West Africa largely during the late 19th century. This included Algeria and Mauritania, and, from 1912, Morocco. But Western Sahara and scattered minor parts of Morocco fell to Spain, and were named Spanish Sahara (subdivided into Río de Oro and Saguia el-Hamra) and Spanish Morocco respectively. These colonial intrusions brought the Muslim Saharan peoples under Christian European rule for the first time, and created lasting cultural and political divides between and within existing populations, as well as upsetting traditional balances of power in differing ways.

The Sahrawi-Moorish areas, then still undefined as to exact territorial boundaries, proved troublesome for the colonizers, just as they had for neighbouring dynasties in previous centuries. The political loyalty of these populations were first and foremost to their respective tribes, and supertribal allegiances and alliances would shift rapidly and unexpectedly. Their nomadic lifestyle made direct control over the territories hard to achieve, as did general lawlessness, an absence of prior central authority, and a widely held contempt for the kind of settled life that the colonizers sought to bring about. Centuries of intertribal warfare and raids for loot (&quot;ghazzu&quot;) guaranteed that the populations were well armed and versed in guerilla-style warfare. Tribes allied to hostile European powers would now also be considered fair game for cattle raids on those grounds, which tied the struggle against France and Spain into the traditional power play of the nomads, aggravating the internal struggles.

Uprisings and violent tribal clashes therefore took place with increasing frequency as European encroachment increased, and on occasion took the form of anti-colonial holy war, or Jihad, as in the case of the Ma al-&#x27;Aynayn uprising in the first years of the 20th century. It was not until the 1930s that Spain was able to finally subdue the interior of present-day Western Sahara, and then only with strong French military assistance. Mauritania&#x27;s raiding Moors had been brought under control in the previous decades, partly through skilful exploitation by the French of traditional rivalries and social divisions between the tribes. In these encounters, the large Reguibat tribe proved especially resistant to the new rulers, and its fighters would regularly slip in out of French and Spanish territory, similarly exploiting the rivalries between European powers. The last major Reguibat raid took place in 1934, after which the Spanish authorities occupied Smara, finally gaining control over the last unpatrolled border territories.

The Sahrawi-Moorish tribes remained largely nomadic until the early to mid-20th century, when Franco-Spanish rivalries (as well as disagreements between different wings of the French colonial regime) managed to impose rigid, if arbitrary, borders on the previously fluid Sahara. The wide-ranging grazing lands of the nomads were split apart, and their traditional economies, based on trans-Saharan caravan trade and raiding of each other and the northern and southern Sahel neighbors, were broken. Little attention was paid to existing tribal confederations and zones of influence when dividing up the Saharan interior.

====Different colonial practices====
French and Spanish colonial governments would gradually, and with varying force, impose their own systems of government and education over these territories, exposing the native populations to differing colonial experiences. The populations in Algeria were subjected to direct French rule, which was organized to enable the massive settlement of French and European immigrants. In Mauritania, they experienced a French non-settler colonial administration which, if light in its demands on the nomads, also deliberately overturned the existing social order, allying itself with lower-ranking marabout and zenaga tribes against the powerful warrior clans of the Hassane Arabs. In southern Morocco, France upheld indirect rule through the sultanate in some areas, while Spain exercised direct administration in others. Spanish Sahara was treated first as a colony, and later as an overseas province, with gradually tightening political conditions, and, in later years, a rapid influx of Spanish settlers (making Spaniards about 20% of the population in 1975). By the time of decolonization in 1950s–1970s, Sahrawi tribes in all these different territories had experienced roughly a generation or more of distinct experiences; often, however, their nomadic lifestyle had guaranteed that they were subjected to less interference than what sedentary populations experienced in the same areas.

====Debate on pre-colonial allegiances====
The period of colonization radically changed existing power structures, leaving a confused legacy of contradictory political affiliations, European-drawn borders with little resemblance to ethnic and tribal realities, and the foundations of modern political conflict.

For example, both sides in the Western Sahara conflict (Morocco vs. the Polisario Front) draw heavily on colonial history to prove their version of reality. Proponents of the Greater Morocco ideology point to some Sahrawi tribes calling upon the Moroccan sultan, who until 1912 remained the last independent Islamic ruler of the area, for assistance against the Europeans (see Ma al-&#x27;Aynayn). Pro-independence Sahrawis, on the other hand, point out that such statements of allegiance were almost routinely given by various tribal leaders to create short-term alliances, and that other heads of tribes indeed similarly proclaimed allegiance to Spain, to France, to Mauritanian emirates, and indeed to each other; they argue that such arrangements always proved temporary, and that the tribal confederations always maintained &quot;de facto&quot; independence of central authority, and would even fight to maintain this independence.

The International Court of Justice issued a ruling on the matter in 1975, stating that there &quot;had&quot; existed ties between the Moroccan sultan and some (mainly northerly Tekna) tribes in then-Spanish Sahara, but that these ties were &quot;not&quot; sufficient to abrogate Western Sahara&#x27;s right to self-determination. The same kind of ruling was issued with regard to Mauritania, where the court found that there were indeed strong tribal and cultural links between the Sahrawis and Mauritanian populations, including historical allegiance to some Moorish emirates, but that these were not ties of a state or government character, and did not constitute formal bonds of sovereignty. Thus, the court recommended the United Nations to continue to pursue self-determination for the Sahrawis, enabling them to choose for themselves whether they wanted Spanish Sahara to turn into an independent state, or to be annexed to Morocco or Mauritania.

=== Decolonisation attempts ===
==== The Western Sahara conflict ====
The area today referred to as Western Sahara remains, according to the United Nations, one of the world&#x27;s last remaining major non-self-governing territories. Morocco controls most of the territory as its Southern Provinces, and while recognized by the United States, the legality is disputed militarily by the Polisario Front, an Algerian-backed movement claiming independence for the territory as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR). Since 1991, there has been a cease-fire between Morocco and Polisario, but disturbances in Moroccan-held territories as well as the ongoing dispute over the legal status of the territory guarantees continued United Nations involvement and occasional international attention to the issue.

====The Polisario Front====
The Polisario Front is the Western Sahara&#x27;s national liberation movement, fighting for the independence of the Western Sahara since 1973—originally against Spanish rule; after 1975, against Mauritania and Morocco; since 1979, against Morocco only. The organization is based in Algeria, where it is responsible for the Tindouf refugee camps. The organization has maintained a cease-fire with Morocco since 1991 (see Settlement Plan), but continues to strive for the territory&#x27;s independence as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) through peaceful negotiations. The Polisario Front restricts its claims to the colonially-defined Western Sahara, holding no claim to, for example, the Sahrawi-populated Tarfaya Strip in Morocco, or any part of Mauritania. Since 1979, the Polisario Front has been recognized by the United Nations as the representative of the people of Western Sahara.

==Demographics==

===Ethnic background: Berbers and Arabs===

As described above, the Hassaniya speaking tribes are of Arabian, Beni Hassan descent, who fused with the dominant Sanhaja Berber tribes, as well as Black African and other indigenous populations (e.g. indigenous Soninke speaking groups). Even though cultural arabization of the Berber people was thorough, some elements of Berber identity remain.

Some tribes, such as the large Reguibat, have a Berber background but have since been thoroughly arabized; others, such as the Oulad Delim, are considered descendants of the Beni Hassan, even though intermarriage with other tribes and former slaves have occurred; a few, such as the Tekna tribal confederation, have retained some Berber dialect of the area. Often, though not in the case of the Tekna, the Berber-Arab elements of a tribe&#x27;s cultural heritage reflects social stratification. In traditional Moorish-Sahrawi society, Arab tribes of the Tekna confederation claimed a role as rulers and protectors of the disarmed weaker Berber tribes of the Takna confederation. Thus, the warrior tribes and nobility would be Arab.

However, most tribes, regardless of their mixed heritage, tend to claim some form of Arab ancestry, as this has been key to achieving social status. Many (the so-called chorfa tribes) will also claim descendancy from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In any case, no tribal identity is cut in stone, and over the centuries a great deal of intermarriage and tribal re-affiliation has occurred to blur former ethnic/cultural lines; groups have often seamlessly re-identified to higher status identities, after achieving the military or economic strength to defeat former rulers. This was, for example, the case of the largest of the Sahrawi tribes, the Reguibat. A Berber-descended zawiya (scholarly) tribe who in the 18th century took up camel nomadism and warrior traditions, they simultaneously took on more and more of an Arab identity, reflecting their new position alongside the traditional warrior castes of Arab Hassane origin, such as the Oulad Delim and the Arabic-speaking tribes of the Tekna confederation.

===Social and ethnic hierarchy===

Generally speaking, the Hassaniya populations were (or are) divided into several groups, of different social status.

At the peak of society were the aristocratic &quot;warrior&quot; lineages or clans, the Hassane, supposed descendants of the Beni Hassan Arab tribe (cf. Oulad Delim). Below them stood the &quot;scholarly&quot; or &quot;clerical&quot; lineages. These were called marabout or zawiya tribes (cf. Oulad Tidrarine). The latter designation the preferred one in among the Western Sahara-centered tribes, who would also almost invariably claim chorfa status to enhance their religious credibility. The zawiya tribes were protected by Hassan overlords in exchange for their religious services and payment of the horma, a tributary tax in cattle or goods; while they were in a sense exploited, the relationship was often more or less symbiotic. Under both these groups, but still part of the Western Sahara society, stood the znaga tribes—tribal groups labouring in demeaning occupations, such as fishermen (cf. Imraguen), as well as peripheral semi-tribal groups working in the same fields (among them the &quot;professional&quot; castes, mallemin and igawen). All these groups were considered to be among the &quot;bidan&quot; grouping.

Below them ranked servile groups known as Haratin, according to some sources descendants of the earlier pre-Arab populations. (Note that &quot;Haratin&quot;, a term of obscure origin, has a different meaning in the Berber regions of Morocco.) They often lived serving affiliated &quot;bidan&quot; families, and as such formed part of the tribe, not tribes of their own. Below them came the slaves themselves, who were owned individually or in family groups, and could hope at best to be freed and rise to the status of Haratin. Rich bidan families would normally own a few slaves at the most, as nomadic societies have less use of slave labour than sedentary societies; however, in some cases, slaves were used to work oasis plantations, farming dates, digging wells etc.

An important reference on Sahrawi population ethnography is the work of Spanish anthropologist Julio Caro Baroja, who in 1952–53 spent several months among native tribes of the Spanish Sahara. He published a 1955 book on the subject. 

===Population===
According to the Ethnologue database, there were more than three million Hassaniya speakers in 2006, of whom 2.7 million resided in Mauritania. The number of Hassaniya speakers identifying as &quot;Sahrawi&quot; in the modern political sense is unknown, and estimates are hotly contested by partisans in the Western Sahara conflict. Most estimates however center around 200,000 to 400,000. These populations are centered in southern Morocco, Western Sahara, and in the Tindouf Province of Algeria, where large number of refugees from Western Sahara are located.

===Languages===

Sahrawis&#x27; native language is the Hassānīya, a variety of Arabic originally spoken by the Beni Hassan Arabian tribes of the Western Sahara. It has almost completely replaced the Berber languages originally spoken in this region. Though clearly a western dialect, Hassānīya is relatively distant from other North African variants of Arabic. Its geographical location exposed it to influence from Zenaga and Wolof. There are several dialects of Hassaniya; the primary differences among them are phonetics. Today Hassaniya is spoken in south-western Algeria, northern Mali, Mauritania, southern-Morocco and Western Sahara. (Mauritania has the biggest concentration of speakers) . Some Sahrawis speak Tashelhit and/or Moroccan Arabic as a second language due to interaction with neighboring populations.

Modern Standard Arabic and the Amazigh language (a standardized version of Moroccan Berber languages) are the official languages of the Moroccan administered part of Western Sahara. While Standard Arabic is the only official language in Mauritania, Algeria and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.

The current Moroccan constitution (adopted in July 2011) mentions, in its 5th article, the Hassaniya language and recommends its preservation as a cultural heritage of Morocco.

Due to the past colonization of Western Sahara and Cape Juby by Spain, Spanish is spoken as a lingua franca by most of the Sahrawis, especially among the Sahrawi diaspora, with the Sahrawi Press Service, official news service of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, being available in Spanish since 2001 and the Sahara Film Festival, Western Sahara&#x27;s only film festival, showing mainly Spanish-language films.

===The refugees===

After the Madrid Accords which transferred administration of the Spanish Sahara to Mauritania and Morocco, and Morocco claimed souvereignty over the territories, dismissing a judgement of the International Court of Justice reaffirming the right of the Sahrawi people to self-determination, from late 1975 an exodus of refugees fled the violence that ensued. Substantial numbers ended up in the Polisario Front movement&#x27;s base areas in the Algerian Sahara, where refugee camps were set up in the Tindouf Province, and a smaller number in camps in Mauritania. The camps in Tindouf were named after towns in the Western Sahara (Awserd, Laayoune, Smara and Dakhla).

As of January 2018, the number of Sahrawi refugees living in the five camps in Tindouf is estimated about 174.000, of whom 125,000 were entitled to food and nutrition assistance by UNHCR and 90,000 individuals regarded &quot;most vulnerable refugees&quot;. The Moroccan government has contended that the figure is much lower, around 45,000 to 50,000, and that these people are kept in the refugee camps against their will by Polisario.

Mauritania housed as of 2009 about 26,000 Sahrawi refugees, classified by UNHCR as &quot;people in a refugee-like situation&quot;. Many of them moved back and forth from the camps in Tindouf, Algeria.

Additionally, between 3,000 and 12,000 Sahrawis live in Spain, their former colonizer.

In 2018, thirty Sahrawi refugees died in an air crash of Algerian Air Force Il-76. They had been visiting Algiers for various medical and bureaucratic reasons. Sahrawis from the refugee camps are regularly provided with free flights in Algerian military transport aircraft.

==Culture==

===Religion===
Religiously, the Sahrawis are Sunni Muslims of the Maliki rite or school. Historically, religious practice has been pragmatically adapted to nomad life and local tradition. Also, since the late medieval period, various Sufi &quot;Turuq&quot; (brotherhoods or orders), have played an important role in popular religious practice; the most important among these are the Qadiriyya and Tijaniyya. Further, among the Hassaniya tribes, certain lineages reputed to be descended from Mohammad, the chorfa, have played an important role in intertribal religious society.

===Tribalism===
:&quot;See article on tribalism and the list of Sahrawi tribes.

The tribe was the historical basis of social and political organisation among the Hassaniya-speaking tribes of the Sahara, well into the colonial and arguably post-colonial period. Traditionally, Hassaniya Sahrawi society was completely tribal, organized in a complex web of shifting alliances and tribal confederations, with no stable and centralized governing authority.

Lawmaking, conflict resolution and central decision-making within the tribe, was carried out by the Djema&#x27;a, (Arabic, gathering) a gathering of elected elders (shaykhs) and religious scholars. Occasionally, larger tribal gatherings could be held in the form of the Ait Arbein (Group of Forty), which would handle supratribal affairs such as common defence of the territory or common diplomacy. During colonial times, Spain attempted to assume some of the legitimacy of these traditional institutions by creating its own Djema&#x27;a, a state-run political association that supported its claims to the territory.

<doc id="622990" wikidata="Q7768408" url="?curid=622990" title="The Ten O'Clock People">
<text>&quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock People&quot; is a short story by American author Stephen King, published in the &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; collection. Unlike many of King&#x27;s stories which take place in fictional places like Castle Rock, Maine, &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock People&quot; takes place in Boston, Massachusetts. A film adaptation has been announced.

== Plot==
Pearson, a Boston office worker, inadvertently discovers that people of authority, including many police officers and political figures, including the Vice President of the United States, are bat-like inhuman monsters disguised as people. While on his 10 o&#x27;clock smoke break, Pearson perceives the bat-like creatures through their disguises. Noticing his reaction, a young black man named Dudley &quot;Duke&quot; Rhinemann stops him from screaming and calms him down. Rhinemann explains that if Pearson wants to live, he must go about his day as usual and meet him at 3 o&#x27;clock after work. Pearson does as he is told and discovers that his boss is also one of the &quot;batmen&quot;. He leaves work a bit shaken, meets Rhinemann and goes to a bar with him. Rhinemann explains that a unique chemical imbalance caused by nicotine withdrawal is the only way to see the creatures and invites Pearson to a resistance meeting.

Shortly after arriving, the leader of the group says he has &quot;big news&quot; for them all, but then launches into a never-ending, pointless speech. Pearson realizes the man is stalling for time and gives warning. The treacherous resistance leader desperately insists the batmen have promised amnesty as batmen ruthlessly storm the building. Many die, including Rhinemann. Pearson, along with two others, escape the meeting. The trio flee to Omaha and form a new resistance group of Ten O&#x27;Clock People. This group successfully kills many &quot;batmen&quot;, and Pearson notes that their war against the batmen was a lot like quitting smoking: &quot;...you have to start somewhere.&quot;

== Inspiration and literary allusions ==
Several of King&#x27;s other stories, most notably &quot;Low Men in Yellow Coats&quot; and &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, feature malevolent creatures called Can-toi, which bear a resemblance to the &quot;batmen&quot; of &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock People&quot;. Servants of the Crimson King, the Can-toi are vaguely humanoid beings with large rodent heads, which they hide beneath masks in order to infiltrate human society. 
King references Raymond Chandler in the story as, to disguise the real reason of the meeting, the resistance claim to be Raymond Chandler enthusiasts.

In &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;&#x27;s ending notes, King states that he intended &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock People&quot; as a Jim Crow analogy about how mainstream society sequesters smokers from the general population:
It has been noted that the plot of King&#x27;s story also resembles the premise of John Carpenter&#x27;s movie &quot;They Live&quot;, made in 1988, which itself was based on the story &quot;Eight O&#x27;Clock in the Morning&quot; 
by Ray Nelson.

== Reception ==
George Beahm wrote in his encyclopedia of King stories that plot summaries can not do the story justice and that it must be read to appreciate the bizarreness. He further compared it to &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&quot;. In &quot;The Essential Steven King&quot;, author Stephen J. Spignesi called it is a complete horror film told in 50 pages that begs for a film adaptation.

== Adaptations ==
In May 2011, Making Ten O&#x27;clock Productions acquired the rights to adapt &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock People&quot; into a feature film starring Jay Baruchel. The film&#x27;s plot is a modernization of King&#x27;s original story and will be directed by Tom Holland. It was announced in July 2015 that the new title of the film is &quot;Cessation&quot;.

In February 2021, it was reported that a television adaptation of &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock People&quot; was being developed by Fabel Entertainment.

<text>&quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot; is a horror short story by American writer Stephen King. It was first published by &quot;Cavalier&quot; in 1972, and was later collected in King&#x27;s book &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; in 1993.

== Plot summary ==
Miss Emily Sidley is a third grade teacher. On one particular day, while she is teaching spelling, Sidley gets the disconcerting feeling that one of her students is staring at her. She turns around and notices that Robert, the quietest student, has his gaze fixed on her. During the following week, Miss Sidley eventually punishes Robert for her suspicions. Robert taunts her by asking her if she wants to see him &quot;change&quot;, which he does (whether it really happened or was a figment of her imagination is not exactly explained) and terrifies the teacher who runs screaming and is nearly run down by a bus.

After the incident, Miss Sidley takes a leave of absence. When she returns, Robert taunts her at recess about there being more creatures at school, posing as normal children. They have replaced the real children they look like, who are imprisoned within their doppelgängers. He says of the real Robert: &quot;I can hear him screaming, Miss Sidley. He wants me to let him out.&quot;

The things Robert is saying soon get to Miss Sidley, and the terrified teacher decides to take drastic measures. She takes out her deceased brother&#x27;s pistol from a drawer and puts it in her purse. That day at school, she takes twelve of her students to a testing room where sound is well concealed, and shoots each one dead. Another teacher comes in as Sidley is preparing to shoot a thirteenth student, and Sidley&#x27;s bad back gives way as the other teacher struggles with her.

Miss Sidley is sent to a mental institution after the murders. She works with little preschoolers each day for therapy. One day she feels the fear that drove her to her crime and asks to be removed from the room. As she is taken away, some of the children slyly watch her, implying that they are also doppelgängers. That night, Miss Sidley commits suicide by slashing her throat and her former psychiatrist soon focuses intently on the children.

== Publication ==
&quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot; was first published in the magazine &quot;Cavalier&quot; in February 1972. It was originally planned to be published in King&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;Night Shift&quot;, in 1978, but editor Bill Thompson opted to cut it for length (King had wanted to cut &quot;Gray Matter&quot;, but deferred to Thompson&#x27;s choice). In 1979, &quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot; was included in the anthology &quot;Nightmares&quot; edited by Charles L. Grant. In 1983, it was included in the anthology &quot;The Evil Image: Two Centuries of Gothic Short Fiction and Poetry&quot; edited by Nora Crow Jaffe and Patricia L. Skarda. In 1993, the story was collected in King&#x27;s book of short stories &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;.

== Reception ==
Christopher Golden describes &quot;Suffer the Little Children&quot; as an &quot;effective chiller.&quot;

King has stated that the story reminds him of the works of Ray Bradbury, and similarities have been noted by other authors as well. King also wrote that the story had &quot;no redeeming social merit whatever.

== Adaptations ==
Bernardo Villela made a Dollar Baby film adaptation. The audiobook version was narrated by actress Whoopi Goldberg.

A 2017 short film directed by Alexander Domogarov Jr. was released, titled &quot;Let the Children in&quot; (&quot;Пустите детей&quot;). The film was made for the YouTube platform in the Russian language with English subtitles. 

A film adaptation is in the works from producers Craig Flores, Nicolas Chartier and Sriram Das. It will be directed by Sean Carter.

<doc id="622993" wikidata="Q1091172" url="?curid=622993" title="Of Mice and Men (1992 film)">
<text>Of Mice and Men is a 1992 American period drama film based on John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1937 novella of the same name and is the fourth film adaptation of the novella. The first was the 1939 film of the same name, the second was in 1968, the third was in 1981, and the fourth was in 1992. Directed and produced by Gary Sinise, the film features Sinise as George Milton, alongside John Malkovich as Lennie Small, with Casey Siemaszko as Curley, John Terry as Slim, Ray Walston as Candy, Joe Morton as Crooks, and Sherilyn Fenn as Curley&#x27;s wife.

Horton Foote adapted the story for film. Its plot centers on George and the intellectually disabled Lennie, two farm workers who travel together and dream of one day owning their own land. The film explores themes of discrimination, loneliness, and the American Dream, as well as the desire for a place to call home.

&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; took part in the 1992 Cannes Film Festival, where Sinise was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or award, given to the director of the best-featured film. After the film debuted in the United States on October 2, 1992, it received acclaim from critics.

==Plot==
The film opens with George Milton reminiscing in a boxcar.

During the Great Depression, quick-witted George Milton and physically strong but mentally disabled Lennie Small are fleeing their previous employment, where Lennie was accused of attempted rape after he held onto a young woman’s dress, prompted by his love of stroking soft things. They travel to work on Tyler Ranch near Soledad.

George reluctantly agrees to tell Lennie again about their dream, describing how they will one day have their own piece of land where Lennie will tend their rabbits. George says if Lennie should ever get in trouble, he is to hide in the brush and wait for him. At Tyler Ranch, the Boss is suspicious of Lennie&#x27;s mental condition. George claims Lennie was kicked in the head by a horse as a child. They befriend old one-handed ranch-hand Candy but dislike the Boss&#x27; son, Curley, who hates people bigger than him. Curley&#x27;s attractive wife flirts with Lennie and George, and George instructs Lennie to avoid her.

George meets their work team, respected headman Slim, and Carlson, who suggests they shoot Candy&#x27;s sick old dog and give him one of Slim&#x27;s pups. Lennie excitedly asks George for a pup. After a hard day, George is proud of Lennie&#x27;s work and gets him his puppy. Candy offers to pitch in with Lennie and George to buy their farm. Just as it seems their dream is moving closer, Curley accuses Slim of keeping his wife company. Curley attacks Lennie for laughing, goading him to fight back. Prompted by George, Lennie crushes Curley&#x27;s hand. George fears for their jobs but Slim gives Curley an ultimatum: if Curley tries to get George and Lennie fired, Slim will humiliate Curley by telling everyone how Curley&#x27;s hand really got crushed. Concerned for his reputation, Curley reluctantly agrees to say his hand got caught in a machine.

Lennie talks about being lonely, and Curley&#x27;s wife attempts to engage him in conversation. Frustrated, she runs to the house in tears vowing to leave the ranch forever. In the barn that evening, Lennie has accidentally killed his puppy and is greatly upset. Curley&#x27;s wife enters and admits her loneliness, confiding that her dreams of being a movie star were crushed. Learning of Lennie&#x27;s love of petting soft things, she lets him stroke her hair. She soon complains and then screams that he is pulling too hard. Trying to keep her quiet, Lennie accidentally breaks her neck. He runs to hide in the brush as George told him to do if in trouble. Candy finds Curley&#x27;s wife dead and informs George. Curley leads a lynch mob but George finds Lennie first and calms him by retelling their dream. As George gets to the part where Lennie tends the rabbits, he shoots Lennie in the back of the head, sparing him death at the hands of the mob.

The scene returns to George in the boxcar, heading South.

==Cast==

* Gary Sinise as George Milton
* John Malkovich as Lennie Small
* Ray Walston as Candy
* Casey Siemaszko as Curley
* Sherilyn Fenn as Curley&#x27;s wife
* Noble Willingham as the Boss
* John Terry as Slim
* Richard Riehle as Carlson
* Joe Morton as Crooks 
* Mark Boone Junior as the Bus Driver
* Moira Harris as the Girl in the Red Dress
* Alexis Arquette as Whitt

==Production==
The first experience Sinise had with Steinbeck&#x27;s work came when Sinise attended Highland Park High School. His drama class went to Guthrie Theater and observed three plays in two days, one being &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. After viewing the play, he &quot;stood up and applauded&quot; and &quot;was trying to scream some sort of acknowledgement of my feelings ... but I was so choked up nothing came out except tears.&quot; He credits the play with me to literature&quot;.

== Differences between the film and book ==
While the film and book tell the same basic story, some creative liberties are taken within the film.

* In the book, Candy only has his left hand, while in the movie, he only has his right, due to the actor Ray Walston being right-handed.
* For the scene depicting Lennie accidentally killing the puppy, the book portrays Lennie feeling remorse for his actions. In the film, he also appears worried and confused.
* When George shoots Lennie, the film depicts George shooting Lennie with little to no hesitation, while in the book, George hesitates. George also uses a Colt revolver in the movie; in the book, he used a Luger.
* In the book, when Lennie talks to Crooks in his room, Candy joins them and they talk about the ranch and Crooks offers to join until Curley&#x27;s wife comes in. She threatens to have Crooks lynched when he tells her to leave. In the movie, Lennie talks to Crooks alone and there is no interaction between Crooks and Curley&#x27;s wife.
* Curley&#x27;s wife is depicted in the book as flirtatious and cruel; she is portrayed as less of a victim when she dies. In the film, she is characterized as more lonely and bored and therefore painted as more sympathetic. This reflects changes Steinbeck himself made to the character in the stage adaptation.

==Release==
===Premiere===
On April 16, 1992, Gilles Jacob, director of the Cannes Film Festival, announced the 27 films competing in the &quot;Official Competition&quot; category, including &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. The film premiered the next month and was Sinise&#x27;s second film to compete at Cannes, after the 1988 feature &quot;Miles from Home&quot;. After viewing &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, critic Don Marshall noted how the audience gave a standing ovation to its cast. Marshall said he was &quot;surprised&quot; that the film did not win an award, although Sinise was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or, given to the director of the best-featured film.

===Box office===
The film made its American debut on October 2, 1992, and grossed $5,471,088 from a total of 398 theaters. The &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; described the film&#x27;s box office performance as poor.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; received positive critical acclaim. 

Critic Roger Ebert complimented the cast on their attention to detail. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Todd McCarthy was impressed at the set design, and contrasted the film&#x27;s &quot;lovely, burnished hues&quot; with the studio-produced 1939 film. He went on to say that the actors&#x27; performances were &quot;sterling&quot; and gave the supporting cast positive reception.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised the physical production and supporting cast, but added that the film &quot;is not very exciting&quot;, possibly because &quot;looking back at Lennie and George with the perspective of time robs them of their urgency.&quot; &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; Steve Davis called &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; &quot;unassuming but well-made&quot;.

===Home media===
MGM released &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; on VHS in 1993 and on Video CD in 1995. The film was later released as a DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on March 4, 2003. The DVD is featured in widescreen with English, French, and Spanish subtitles, and has the option of French dubbing. The film was then released on Blu-ray by Olive Films on January 19, 2016.

<text>Berthillon is a French manufacturer and retailer of luxury ice cream and sorbet, with its primary store on the Île Saint-Louis, in Paris, France. The company is owned and operated by the Chauvin family, descendants of the eponymous Monsieur Berthillon, who from 1954 operated a café and hotel called &quot;Le Bourgogne&quot;. 

The ice cream shop became famous in 1961 when a French restaurant guide Gault Millau wrote about &quot;this astonishing ice cream shop hidden in a bistro on the Ile Saint-Louis.&quot; They are known for using fresh and high quality ingredients and keep the recipe of their sorbet (i.e. the proportion of milk and egg) secret.

Raymond Berthillon, founder of Berthillon, died on 9 August 2014.

<doc id="623004" wikidata="Q290114" url="?curid=623004" title="Anastacia (album)">
<text>Anastacia is the third studio album by American singer Anastacia. It was released on March 29, 2004, by Epic Records. 
Primarily a pop, power pop and rock album, &quot;Anastacia&quot; also includes elements of soul and R&amp;B. It was a commercial success, peaking at the top of the albums charts in several countries, including Australia, Belgium, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and becoming one of the top 10 best-selling albums of the year in much of Europe. The album has sold eight million copies.

The album was never released in Anastacia&#x27;s native United States, despite plans for an August 30, 2005, release, which was ultimately canceled for unknown reasons. Years later, however, it was officially released in the United States digitally. Anastacia promoted the album with television performances and interviews. To further promote the album, Anastacia embarked on the Live at Last Tour in 2004, her first headlining tour.

==Background==

In January 2003, Anastacia had discovered that she had breast cancer when she was preparing for breast reduction surgery due to orthopedic reasons. Anastacia subsequently established the Anastacia Fund through The Breast Cancer Research Foundation to promote awareness of breast cancer amongst younger women.

After this traumatic experience, Anastacia entered recording studios in September 2003 to record the &quot;Anastacia&quot; album with Glen Ballard, Dallas Austin, and Dave Stewart for release in 2004. Anastacia was after more of a rock feel on the album, as noted in tracks such as &quot;Seasons Change&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;I Do&quot; (which features Sonny Sandoval from P.O.D.).

Anastacia explained on her website that her illness made it more difficult to record the album:
&quot;... the experience was not pleasant. I usually look for the bright side of things, but so far nothing about making this record was positive for me. My doctor told me I&#x27;d be tired, not stupid. I could not focus on anything. I&#x27;d write a verse and then I couldn&#x27;t write the chorus or I&#x27;d write the chorus but couldn&#x27;t write the bridge. I couldn&#x27;t talk, I couldn&#x27;t think straight, I was totally out of it. The doctors said I&#x27;d be tired—but of course I had insomnia. It was tough...&quot;
She struggled through the process to finish the album for release in March 2004.

==Commercial performance==

&quot;Anastacia&quot; proved to be a huge commercial success, topping the charts in 11 European countries, including Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, while reaching number two in Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot; was equally successful, peaking at number one in Australia, Austria, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland, and reaching the top five in several other countries and on the European Hot 100 Singles chart. The album also spawned another three singles: &quot;Sick and Tired&quot;, &quot;Welcome to My Truth&quot;, and &quot;Heavy on My Heart&quot;. &quot;Sick and Tired&quot; was the most successful of the three, charting inside the top five across numerous European nations, almost matching the success of &quot;Left Outside Alone&quot;. &quot;Welcome to My Truth&quot; earned Anastacia her best-selling single ever in Spain and gained moderate European airplay and sales success, while &quot;Heavy on My Heart&quot; fared slightly worse, while proceeds from the single were donated to the Anastacia Fund.

<doc id="623006" wikidata="Q3491881" url="?curid=623006" title="The Night Flier">
<text>&quot;The Night Flier&quot; is a horror short story by American writer Stephen King, first published in the 1988 anthology &quot;Prime Evil: New Stories by the Masters of Modern Horror&quot;, and then in King&#x27;s own 1993 &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; collection.

== Plot summary ==
Richard Dees is a deeply cynical reporter for a trashy supermarket tabloid called &quot;Inside View&quot;. His current subject of investigation is the Night Flier, an apparent serial killer who travels between small airports in a Cessna Skymaster, gruesomely killing people in a way that leads Dees to think the man is a lunatic who believes himself to be a vampire. 

After only a few days of interviewing witnesses and following the killer&#x27;s trail in his own Beechcraft Bonanza, Dees overtakes the Night Flier during a violent thunderstorm at Wilmington International Airport, and quickly learns that he is badly mistaken about his would-be quarry; it is, indeed, a vampire that is doing the killings. After Dees watches the Night Flier casually empty the bloody contents of his bladder into an airport urinal (or as much of this act as he can see reflected in a mirror), the creature warns off his &quot;would-be biographer,&quot; destroys his photographic evidence, and leaves the mortally shaken reporter amidst a scene of carnage to explain himself to police and watch as the Night Flier&#x27;s plane takes off.

== Publication ==
&quot;The Night Flier&quot; was first published in the 1988 anthology &quot;Prime Evil: New Stories by the Masters of Modern Horror&quot;. It was collected in King&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;.

== Connections to other works ==
Dees previously made a brief appearance in King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;. In the notes of &quot;Nightmares and Dreamscapes&quot;, King states that the Night Flier could also be the titular character of his short story &quot;Popsy&quot;.

The character of the Night Flier is used by Kim Newman in his short story &quot;You Are the Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;. In it, he is paired with the character Rainbird from &quot;Firestarter&quot;, with both working for the Shop. Newman gives the Night Flier the name of Andrews.

The &quot;Inside View&quot; is a sensationalist tabloid pushing blood, gore, and mystery stories about alien abductions and the like, and has also been mentioned in several of King&#x27;s novels and novellas, such as &quot;Desperation&quot;, &quot;Insomnia&quot;, &quot;The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands&quot;, &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, &quot;Needful Things&quot;, &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;, &quot;From a Buick 8&quot;, &quot;Elevation&quot;, and &quot;If It Bleeds&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
The story was adapted into the 1997 film of the same name directed by Mark Pavia and starring Miguel Ferrer as Dees. The film adaptation follows the original plot fairly closely (and maintains Dees&#x27; deeply unsympathetic nature), except for adding a rival in the form of up-and-coming female reporter Katherine Blair, and changing Dees&#x27; ultimate fate.

== Reception ==
Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the story &quot;King&#x27;s jeremiad against the tabloid press&quot;, though he states that there is a degree of hypocrisy to the satire, given that King himself makes a living selling sensationalistic stories. George Beahm called it &quot;prime King&quot; that &quot;eschew[s] Anne Rice-type vampires&quot;.

<text>The with diacritic Kanglā, officially known as the Kangla Fort, is an old fortified palace at Imphal, in the Manipur state of India. It was formerly situated on both sides (western and eastern) of the bank of the Imphal River, now remaining only on the western side in ruined conditions. Kangla means &quot;the prominent part of the dry land&quot; in old Meetei. It was the traditional seat of the past Meetei rulers of Manipur.
Kangla (Imphal) was the ancient capital of pre-modern Manipur.
The Kangla is a revered spot for the people of Manipur, reminding them of the days of their independence. It is a sacred place to the Meiteis.

The Kangla is being proposed to be declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, for which there are discussions ongoing in the Indian Parliament.

== History ==

The Kangla was the seat of administration of the Meitei rulers of the Ningthouja dynasty (33 CE to 1891 CE).

== Flora and fauna ==

The Kangla possesses a sobriquet, &quot;Lungs of Imphal&quot; as it is heavily forested, providing oxygen at a massive level in the heart of the metropolis of Manipur.
Unfortunately, due to some developmental construction activities in the last few years, some minor but significant deforestation occurred inside the Kangla.

In the year 2009, the Kangla Herbal Garden was set up by the Kangla Fort Board, in order to carry out the plan of planting medicinal plants inside the Kangla into action. The responsibility for bringing up the botanical garden was held by the Lamphel based sub-branch of the North East Institute of Science and Technology, Jorhat (NEIST).
In the year 2010, the Government of Manipur financed out of to the NEIST to carry out the task. It planted around 131 different plants, (including around 20 medicinal plant species) in the garden. Notable plant species nurtured in the Kangla Herbal Garden include &quot;heigru&quot; (), &quot;kihori&quot; (), agar (Aquilaria agallocha Lamp), neem (Azadirachta indica A Zuss), tera (), singairei () and leihao (). An area covering 3.5 acres of land was allocated for the development of the botanical garden by the Manipur Government.

During the month of June in 2019, around 700 indigenous fruit-bearing tree saplings were planted inside the , formerly known as &quot;Biodiversity Park&quot; of the Kangla) of the Kangla by the Government of Manipur, under the initiative of Green Manipur Mission.

During the month of September in 2019, around 120 trees, including mayokfa, agar, uningthou, teak, chahui and samba, were planted inside the Kangla by the editorial board and the management team of &quot;The Sangai Express&quot; (TSE), a newspaper daily of Manipur, on its 20th foundation day.

There&#x27;s another garden named &quot;Engellei Leikol&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Rock Garden&quot; of the Kangla) located in the southern part of the Kangla.

During the month of May in 2022, around 50 fruit-bearing plants were planted inside the Kangla by the Institute of Bioresources and Sustainable Development (IBSD).

There&#x27;s a plan for planting 10,000 saplings of fruit bearing trees inside the Kangla by the Kangla Fort Board, under the leadership of Nongthombam Biren, the Chief Minister of Manipur.
