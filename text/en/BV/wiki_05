<text>A bell tower is a tower that contains one or more bells, or that is designed to hold bells even if it has none. Such a tower commonly serves as part of a Christian church, and will contain church bells, but there are also many secular bell towers, often part of a municipal building, an educational establishment, or a tower built specifically to house a carillon. Church bell towers often incorporate clocks, and secular towers usually do, as a public service.

The term campanile (, , ), from the Italian &quot;campanile&quot;, which in turn derives from &quot;campana&quot;, meaning &quot;bell&quot;, is synonymous with &quot;bell tower&quot;; though in English usage campanile tends to be used to refer to a free standing bell tower. A bell tower may also in some traditions be called a belfry, though this term may also refer specifically to the substructure that houses the bells and the ringers rather than the complete tower.

The tallest free-standing bell tower in the world, high, is the Mortegliano Bell Tower, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region, Italy.

==Purpose==

Bells are rung from a tower to enable them to be heard at a distance. Church bells can signify the time for worshippers to go to church for a communal service, and can be an indication of the fixed times of daily Christian prayer, called the canonical hours, which number seven and are contained in breviaries. They are also rung on special occasions such as a wedding, or a funeral service. In some religious traditions they are used within the liturgy of the church service to signify to people that a particular part of the service has been reached.
A bell tower may have a single bell, or a collection of bells which are tuned to a common scale. They may be stationary and chimed, rung randomly by swinging through a small arc, or swung through a full circle to enable the high degree of control of English change ringing. They may house a carillon or chimes, in which the bells are sounded by hammers connected via cables to a keyboard. These can be found in many churches and secular buildings in Europe and America including college and university campuses.

A variety of electronic devices exist to simulate the sound of bells, but any substantial tower in which a considerable sum of money has been invested will generally have a real set of bells.

Some churches have an exconjuratory in the bell tower, a space where ceremonies were conducted to ward off weather-related calamities, like storms and excessive rain. The main bell tower of the Cathedral of Murcia has four.

In Christianity, many churches ring their church bells from belltowers three times a day, at 9 am, 12 pm and 3 pm to summon the Christian faithful to recite the Lord&#x27;s Prayer; the injunction to pray the Lord&#x27;s prayer thrice daily was given in &quot;Didache&quot; 8, 2 f., which, in turn, was influenced by the Jewish practice of praying thrice daily found in the Old Testament, specifically in , which suggests &quot;evening and morning and at noon&quot;, and , in which the prophet Daniel prays thrice a day. The early Christians thus came to pray the Lord&#x27;s Prayer at 9 am, 12 pm and 3 pm; as such, in Christianity, many Lutheran and Anglican churches ring their church bells from belltowers three times a day: in the morning, at noon and in the evening calling Christians to recite the Lord&#x27;s Prayer. Many Catholic Christian churches ring their bells thrice a day, at 6a.m., noon, and 6p.m., to call the faithful to recite the Angelus, a prayer recited in honour of the Incarnation of God. Oriental Orthodox Christians, such as Copts and Indians, use a breviary such as the Agpeya and Shehimo to pray the canonical hours seven times a day while facing in the eastward direction; church bells are tolled, especially in monasteries, to mark these seven fixed prayer times (cf. ).

The Christian tradition of the ringing of church bells from a belltower is analogous to Islamic tradition of the adhan (call to prayer) from a minaret.

Old bell towers which are no longer used for their original purpose may be kept for their historic or architectural value, though in countries with a strong campanological tradition they often continue to have the bells rung.

==History==
===Europe===
In 400 AD, Paulinus of Nola introduced church bells into the Christian Church. By the 11th century, bells housed in belltowers became commonplace.

Historic bell towers exist throughout Europe. The Irish round towers are thought to have functioned in part as bell towers. Famous medieval European examples include Bruges (Belfry of Bruges), Ypres (Cloth Hall, Ypres), Ghent (Belfry of Ghent). Perhaps the most famous European free-standing bell tower, however, is the so-called &quot;Leaning Tower of Pisa&quot;, which is the campanile of the Duomo di Pisa in Pisa, Italy. In 1999 thirty-two Belgian belfries were added to the UNESCO&#x27;s list of World Heritage Sites. In 2005 this list was extended with one Belgian and twenty-three Northern French belfries and is since known as &quot;Belfries of Belgium and France&quot;. Most of these were attached to civil buildings, mainly city halls, as symbols of the greater power the cities in the region got in the Middle Ages; a small number of buildings not connected with a belfry, such as bell towers of—or with their—churches, also occur on this same list (details). In the Middle Ages, cities sometimes kept their important documents in belfries. Not all are on a large scale; the &quot;bell&quot; tower of Katúň, in Slovakia, is typical of the many more modest structures that were once common in country areas. Archaic wooden bell towers survive adjoining churches in Lithuania and as well as in some parts of Poland.

In Orthodox Eastern Europe bell ringing also has a strong cultural significance (Russian Orthodox bell ringing), and churches were constructed with bell towers (see also List of tall Orthodox Bell towers).

===China===
Bell towers (Chinese: &quot;Zhonglou&quot;, Japanese: &quot;Shōrō&quot;) are common in China and the countries of related cultures. They may appear both as part of a temple complex and as an independent civic building, often paired with a drum tower, as well as in local church buildings. Among the best known examples are the Bell Tower (&quot;Zhonglou&quot;) of Beijing and the Bell Tower of Xi&#x27;an.

<text>Slot 2 refers to the physical and electrical specification for the 330-lead Single Edge Contact Cartridge (or edge-connector) used by Intel&#x27;s Pentium II Xeon and Pentium III Xeon.

When first introduced, Slot 1 Pentium IIs were intended to replace the Pentium and Pentium Pro processors in the home, desktop, and low-end symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) markets. The Pentium II Xeon, which was aimed at multiprocessor workstations and servers, was largely similar to the ordinary Pentium II, being based on the same P6 Deschutes core, differing by offering the choice of L2 cache capacity of 1024 or 2048 KB besides 512 KB, and by operating it at the core frequency (the Pentium II used cheaper third-party SRAM chips, running at 50% of CPU speed, to reduce cost).

Because the design of the 242-lead Slot 1 connector did not support the full-speed L2 cache of the Xeon, an extended 330-lead connector was developed. This new connector, dubbed &#x27;Slot 2&#x27;, was used for Pentium II Xeon (codenamed &#x27;Drake&#x27;) and Pentium III Xeon (codenamed &#x27;Tanner&#x27; and &#x27;Cascades&#x27;). Slot 1 was finally replaced by the Socket 370 with the revised Pentium III codenamed Tualatin for the low power dual-processor servers, and Slot 2 by Socket 603 with Pentium 4-based Xeon (codenamed Foster) for workstations and quad-processor servers.

<text>Slot A is the physical and electrical specification for a 242-lead single-edge-connector used by early versions of AMD&#x27;s Athlon processor.

The Slot A connector allows for a higher bus rate than Socket 7 or Super Socket 7. Slot A motherboards use the EV6 bus protocol, a technology originally developed by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) for its Alpha 21264 microprocessor.

Slot A is mechanically compatible but electrically incompatible with Intel&#x27;s Slot 1. As a consequence, Slot A motherboards were designed to have the connector&#x27;s installed orientation be rotated 180 degrees relative to Slot 1 motherboards to discourage accidental insertion of a Slot 1 processor into a Slot A motherboard, and vice versa. The choice to use the same mechanical connector as the Intel Slot 1 also allowed motherboard manufacturers to keep costs down by stocking the same part for both Slot 1 and Slot A assemblies.

Unlike with Slot 1 CPUs, there were never any converter cards, or slotkets made that allowed Socket A CPUs to be used on Slot A motherboards, as what happened with the slotkets made for using Socket 370 CPUs in Slot 1 motherboards.

AMD went back into using a traditional socket interface with Socket A in 2000.

== Chipsets==
AMD offered official chipsets for the Slot A CPUs. These are included in the table below.
Third-party chipsets includes a large number of VIA K-series chipsets.

In practice, third-party chipsets were heavily favoured by motherboard manufacturers. Stability problems and compatibility quirks from these chipsets abounded from manufacturers not following chipset designers&#x27; guidelines. This caused long-lasting damage to AMD&#x27;s reputation, despite AMD having nothing to do with the poorly-realised hardware. A similar incident happened with third-party chipsets for Super Socket 7 CPUs, of which AMD tried to remedy it by putting quality assurance measures for the Athlon, which used Slot A CPUs. Despite this, however, the aforementioned problems mentioned above still lingered on for quite a while, even for Athlon CPUs.

<text>Tom a Lincoln is a romance by the English writer Richard Johnson, published in two parts in 1599 and 1607. The principal character, Tom, is a bastard son of King Arthur and a girl named Angellica. He is the father of two other important characters, the Black Knight and the Faerie Knight.

The style has been characterized as euphuistic romance.

==Plot==
Part I begins with the story of Tom&#x27;s birth: he is the product of an illicit affair between King Arthur and Angellica, the Lord Mayor of London (Earl of London)&#x27;s daughter. To conceal their adultery, Arthur and Angellica secretly send their child to be raised by Antonio, a Lincolnshire shepherd. The shepherd raises Tom as his own, but Tom&#x27;s innate nobility leads him to seek adventure as the &quot;Red Rose Knight.&quot; He leads a life of crime before his adoptive father berates him and reveals that he was a foundling. Arthur, who realizes that Tom is his son, sends his knights Lancelot, Tristram, and Triamour to bring him to court. Tom is immediately made a Knight of the Round Table, but Arthur does not reveal his identity. Tom woos the court with his feats of martial valor, culminating with his success in England&#x27;s war against Portugal. He then sets out with a company of knights on an adventure to find his parents. Tom&#x27;s ship lands on an island called Fairy Land, inhabited entirely by women. Tom sleeps with the queen, Celia, but is compelled to return to his quest. He sets out, vowing to return. Back on the ship, Lancelot tells the tale of the great love between a young girl and prince Valentine of Greece. At length the ship comes to Prester John&#x27;s kingdom, where Tom defends the king against a dragon before making off with his daughter Anglitora, who subsequently gives birth to the Black Knight. Tom attempts to return to Fairy Land, where Celia has given birth to his son, who will later be known as the Faerie Knight. They get within sight of the island, but a trick of the tides prevents the ship from landing. Thinking she is abandoned, Celia pins a note to her chest and drowns herself in the sea. Tom&#x27;s crew recovers her body and sails back to England, where they bury her with full honors.

Part II largely undermines the action and motifs of Part I. A dying Arthur reveals his adultery with Angellica, and Tom&#x27;s parentage is revealed. When Anglitora finds out he is illegitimate, she kills him. His spirit goes on to tell the Black Knight her deed, and he in turn kills her. Both the Black Knight and the Faerie Knight end up traveling together on many adventures.

<doc id="611262" wikidata="Q1159408" url="?curid=611262" title="Dandenong, Victoria">
<text>Dandenong ( ) is a southeastern suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, about from the Melbourne CBD. It is the council seat of the City of Greater Dandenong local government area, with a recorded population of 30,127 at the . Situated mainly on the northwest bank of the lower Dandenong Creek, it is from the eponymous Dandenong Ranges to its northeast and completely unrelated in both location and nature of the settlement.

A regional transport hub and manufacturing centre of Victoria, Dandenong is located at the junctional region of the Dandenong Valley Highway, Princes Highway, Monash Freeway and Dingley Freeway, and is the gateway town of the Gippsland railway line into West Gippsland. It is directly neighboured from the north and south by two sister suburbs Dandenong North and Dandenong South, from the east by Doveton, and from the northwest and southwest by Noble Park and Keysborough, respectively. The easternmost and westernmost neighbourhoods of suburb are also unofficially named Dandenong East and Dandenong West, separated from the main portions of the suburb by Stud Road and Princes Highway, and Cheltenham Road and Gladstone Road/Jones Road/Bennet Street, respectively.

Dandenong began as a township in 1852 and at the start of the 20th century was an important regional city with its own suburbs. During the mid-20th century it became a major manufacturing and commercial area, and eventually an incorporated satellite city of the expanding Greater Melbourne conurbation. A business district, the former town centre, covers much of its area and is one of the largest in Greater Melbourne. It is currently undergoing major transit-oriented urban renewal, which was first planned in the Melbourne 2030 strategy.

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to the European settlement of Australia, the flat to undulating land was densely forested with red gum and was inhabited by the Woiwurrung Indigenous Australian tribe.

The name is generally thought to be derived from the Woiwurrung word &quot;Tanjenong&quot; meaning &quot;lofty mountains&quot; possibly referring to the nearby Dandenong ranges.

Another popular theory is that the name comes from &#x27;bad flour&#x27;, or &#x27;no good damper&#x27;. A local tale revolves around local aboriginals obtaining a bag of lime and mistakenly using it to make damper. An old local hotel was the &#x27;No Good Damper Inn&#x27;.

A third version has the name Dandenong coming from &#x27;a burning&#x27; and &#x27;the past&#x27; reflecting bushfires on the Dandenongs.

====European settlement====
Joseph Hawdon established a pastoral run on Narra Narrawong in 1837, bringing cattle from Sydney by land. Soon a few timber cutters and a police camp were also located there. Dandenong Post Office opened on 1 July 1848.

By 1850, the whole area had been taken up for grazing. Dandenong Creek was first bridged in 1840. A road was made from Melbourne, making Dandenong, by the late 1850s, an important staging post for travellers into Gippsland. It became known as the &#x27;gateway to Gippsland&#x27;. A township was surveyed in 1852. Milling of the red gum timber became an important industry, and charcoal burning, tanning, quarrying and brick making also flourished. A livestock market was established in 1866.

The Western Port Aboriginal Protectorate Station was located north-east of Dandenong from 1840 to 1844. This area had been an important meeting and ceremonial site for Aboriginal tribes. The Native Police Corps established its headquarters there until its disbandment in 1852. The Police Paddocks were then used for breeding and resting police horses.

By 1861, there were 40 houses in the township housing 193 people. In 1866, Dandenong Market commenced trading, selling livestock, fruit, dairy products and other farm produce. Dandenong Shire was proclaimed in 1873. The Australian Handbook records the progress of the town by 1875.

The railway line from Melbourne to Dandenong was constructed in the mid-1870s. Dandenong station opened 8 October 1877.

The Dandenong Town Hall, Lonsdale Street, was built in Free Classical style in 1890 as the combined Shire Hall, Courthouse and Mechanics Institute, at a cost of about 12,000 pounds. The architects were Beswicke and Hutchins and the contractor McCullogh and McAlpine. The two-storey, stucco rendered brick building, on a bluestone base course, features a lofty, Mansard-roofed, corner clock tower and projecting end wings with serlian motif windows and capped by pedimented niches.

===Postwar era===
The post-war industrial boom brought an influx of European migrants, particularly from Italy and Greece. This caused the creation of several suburbs of Dandenong including the public housing estate of Doveton.

In the 1950s, Melbourne rapidly expanded south east along the Princes Highway and Gippsland railway line to Dandenong and beyond and it became a major metropolitan manufacturing and commercial area as industry extended into the outer suburbs. By the late 1960s, it was officially a suburban area of Melbourne and central Dandenong was transformed by modern buildings, with the redevelopment of the post office to a two-storey modern building in 1960 followed by a three-storey office development for AMP in 1966 and Dandenong railway station in 1975. In 1956, Holden opened a plant.

From the early 1960s onward, Albanian immigrants settled in Dandenong and built its first mosque in 1985.

===Urban renewal===

Development in Dandenong had stagnated since the opening of the Armada Dandenong Plaza shopping centre which resulted in the closure of many shops in the central business district. Under the Melbourne 2030 policy, Dandenong was classified as a major activity centre due to its central location with regard to its access to transport. These projects can be considered to be transit-oriented development, where population density is intended to be higher compared to other areas with poorer access to transport.

In 2006, the Victorian Government committed $290 million towards the &quot;Revitalising Central Dandenong&quot; initiative, to transform central Dandenong into a vibrant and thriving economic and service hub. The State Government funding was spent on land acquisition and consolidation, delivery of infrastructure upgrades (Londsdale Street, Stockman&#x27;s Bridge, Station precinct upgrades and public amenity) and facilitation of key catalyst projects such as the Australian Taxation Office, brand new Council Civic Centre and the State Government Services Hub.

Dandenong&#x27;s redevelopment is undertaken by Development Victoria, a Victorian Government agency responsible for urban renewal, in collaboration with the Greater Dandenong City Council. The project is a long-term project, expected to continue for 15 to 20 years.

&quot;Metro 3175&quot;, named after Dandenong&#x27;s postcode is a major redevelopment of the former Dandenong Livestock Market (established 1866 and closed in 1998) begun in November 2005 consisting of a mixed-use development consisting of 1100 residences as well as cafes and restaurants. Because the site is isolated from the rest of the central Dandenong area, George Street was widened and extended with a bridge across the railway lines to improve access between the precincts. The bridge provides access for cars, pedestrians and cyclists and improves connections to bus services in the area. Additionally, Cheltenham Road, a major east–west arterial has been realigned to remove traffic from nearby streets and encourage pedestrian use.

Redevelopment of the Dandenong Town Hall (built in 1880) into a performing arts centre began in 2004 known as Drum Theatre to a designed by Williams Ross Architects. The centre was redeveloped with a 525-seat proscenium theatre. At the cost of $13 million, the centre was opened by Victorian Premier Steve Bracks on 11 February 2006. The redevelopment involved renovating the existing town hall building and the construction of a modern drum-shaped building. Its striking red colour is prominently visible from nearby streets in the CBD. There was some controversy over fears the redevelopment would destroy the historic facade of the town hall building, but this proved unfounded.

==Geography==

Dandenong is bounded in the north by Heatherton Road (State Route 14), in the east by the Dandenong Creek and Claredon Road, in the south by the Dandenong Bypass (State Route 49) and the Pakenham railway line, and in the west by the Yarraman/Mile Creek just east of EastLink (M3).

The suburb is situated northeast of the confluence of the Mile Creek into the lower section of the Dandenong Creek, a major urban stream that flows west from the foothill of the Dandenong Ranges at Olinda before turning at the junction of Ringwood, Vermont and Wantirna to course southwards meanderingly and form the Patterson River at Bangholme. The creek marks most of Dandenong&#x27;s eastern boundary with the neighbouring Doveton, and crosses westwards through the southern edge of the town center, forming a green belt with several riverside linear parks and nature reserves including the Dandenong Park.

==Politics==
===Federal===
At federal level, Dandenong is divided between the electoral divisions of Bruce in the north, currently held by Julian Hill since 2016; and Isaacs in the south, held by Mark Dreyfus since 2007, both incumbent Labor representatives.

===State===
Dandenong belongs to its own electoral district of Dandenong, held currently by Labor representative Gabrielle Williams since 2014.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 census, the most common ancestries were Hazara 9.7%, English 9.7%, Australian 9.1%, Indian 7.1%, Afghan 7.4%. 30.9% of people born in Australia with other common countries of birth being Afghanistan 11.5%, India 9.5%, Sri Lanka 5.4%, Pakistan 4% and North Macedonia 2.7%. Most common languages, other than English spoken at home are Hazaraghi 10.1%, Albanian 5%, Dari 4.4%, Punjabi 4.4% and Tamil 3.5%. Islam is the most common religion with 34.1%, followed by Catholicism 12.3%, Hinduism 7.4% with 13.7% recording no religious affiliation. 

==Transport==

Dandenong is primarily a private transport-dependent community due to the relatively poorer public transit compared to other suburbs closer to the CBD. It is served by the Monash Freeway (M1) which passes near its northeast, as well as several other major arterial roads such as the Princes Highway (National Route 1), Stud Road/Dandenong-Frankston Road (State Route 9), Cheltenham Road (Route 10), Heatherton Road (Route 14) and Dandenong Bypass (Route 49). The EastLink (M3) also passes near the western edge of the suburb, and the South Gippsland Highway (Route 12) branches off the Princes Highway at the southeastern corner of the suburb.

The Dandenong railway station is situated at the southern edge of the suburb CBD and is an interchange station for the Pakenham and Cranbourne lines, as well as V/Line regional trains on the Gippsland railway line. It is approximately 50 minutes from Flinders Street station in Melbourne CBD by stopping-all-station train, but shorter if via limited express services. The Victorian state government has proposed triplication of the railway line to support a higher volume of trains for the growing population in and around Dandenong as well as other suburbs and towns along the line.

The station also serves as a transport hub for the local bus network, with almost all bus routes in the area passing through Dandenong station and an interchange on Langhorne Street in the CBD. Most buses in the area are operated by Ventura Bus Lines, whose depot is located near the railway station.

Cycling is facilitated via the Dandenong Creek Trail, part of the off-road cycling network which connects the city trails to nearby Jells Park.

In a council planning policy document, light rail is suggested as a future transport mode for the central Dandenong area.

==Education==

Three state high schools – Lyndale Secondary College and two campuses of Dandenong High School (Dandenong and Cleeland) – and one Catholic high school (St John&#x27;s Regional College), as well as numerous state and two Catholic primary schools, are located within the suburb&#x27;s boundaries. Dandenong also contains Emerson School, a specialist school for those with mild intellectual disabilities from a catchment area. KingKids Early Learning Centre in Dandenong provides play-based education for children aged 6 weeks to 6 years, focusing on holistic development, tailored care, and empowering learning experiences in a supportive environment.

==Sport==
The suburb has several Australian rules football clubs including the Dandenong West Football Club, competing in the Southern Football Netball League at the Dandenong Showgrounds. Other teams in the Dandenong area include the Dandenong Stingrays (Talent League) at Shepley Oval, St John&#x27;s Old Collegians (VAFA) at Carroll Reserve, and the Dandenong Saints (DDJFL – juniors) at Carroll Reserve. Numerous clubs have folded in recent years.

Dandenong hosts numerous football (soccer) clubs. Dandenong Thunder plays in the Victorian Premier League which is the second tier behind the A-League and enjoys much support from the local community. The side plays their home fixtures at George Andrews Reserve and has been both premiers and champions of Victoria multiple times. The other teams are Dandenong City SC, White Star Dandenong FC and Dandenong Wolves Football Club. Dandenong-based teams have hosted many international players in its time, including Ljubo Miličević, Eugene Galeković, Ante Milicic, Cengiz Benlisoy, Semih Yildiz, Cenk Ali and Ilker Berberoglu.

Dandenong also has numerous cricket clubs in the area. Dandenong Cricket Club plays in the Victorian Premier League and has produced a number of state players to date. The most important of these have been Peter Siddle (Australia), Darren Pattinson (England) and Cameron White (Australia) who have all gone on to play test cricket. Other prominent players from the club include Ian Harvey, James Pattinson, Brett Forsyth, Ercan Ileri, Jackson Coleman and Kumar Sana. The area also consists of a women&#x27;s team, the Dandenong Women&#x27;s Cricket Club who compete in the Victorian Women&#x27;s Cricket Association.
Several other clubs in the area play in the Dandenong and District Cricket Association (DDCA). These include Buckley Ridges, Dandenong North, Dandenong West, and the St Mary&#x27;s Cricket Clubs.

<text>The Black Knight (, , ) appears in various forms in Arthurian legend.

* A supernatural Black Knight is summoned by Sir Calogrenant (Cynon ap Clydno in Welsh mythology) in the tale of &quot;Yvain, the Knight of the Lion&quot;. The Black Knight bests Calogrenant, but the Black Knight is later killed by Ywain (Owain mab Urien) when he attempts to complete the quest that Calogrenant failed.
* Perhaps the first mention of a Black Knight by name is in Raoul de Houdenc&#x27;s &quot;La Vengeance Raguidel&quot; (early 13th century), where &quot;Noir Chevalier&quot; is first mentioned in line 633.
* The eponymous protagonist of &quot;Morien&quot; wears black armour and bears a black shield, in addition to having black skin, and as such is occasionally referred to as &quot;the black knight&quot;.
* In &quot;Sir Perceval of Galles&quot; (written in the early 14th century), the Black Knight jealously tied his wife to a tree after hearing she had exchanged rings with Perceval. Perceval defeated the black knight and explained that it was an innocent exchange.
* A black knight, named Sir Perarde, is also mentioned in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur: The Tale of Sir Gareth&quot; (Book IV) as having been killed by Gareth when he was traveling to rescue Lyonesse.
* A black knight is the son of Tom a&#x27; Lincoln and Anglitora (the daughter of Prester John) in Richard Johnson&#x27;s Arthurian romance &quot;Tom a Lincoln&quot;. Through Tom, he is a grandson of King Arthur&#x27;s, though his proper name is never given. He killed his mother after hearing from his father&#x27;s ghost that she had murdered him. He later joined the Faerie Knight, his half-brother, in adventures.
* Brunor the Black, the father and son bearing the same name in the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot; and some other works.
* An alias of Sir Lancelot in which Sir Galehaut first knows him by during the Lancelot-Grail cycle.

<doc id="611279" wikidata="Q1284236" url="?curid=611279" title="Congress of Colombia">
<text>The Congress of the Republic of Colombia () is the name given to Colombia&#x27;s bicameral national legislature.

The Congress of Colombia consists of the 108-seat Senate, and the 188-seat Chamber of Representatives, Members of both houses are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms.

The composition, organization and powers of Congress and the legislative procedure are established by the fourth title of the Colombian Constitution. According to article 114 of the Constitution, the Congress amends the constitution, makes the law and exercises political control over the government and the public administration. In addition, the Constitution and the law grant other powers to Congress, including certain judicial powers and electing senior judges and other senior public officials.

Both houses of Congress meet at the neoclassical &quot;Capitolio Nacional&quot; (&quot;National Capitol&quot;) building in central Bogotá, the construction of which began in 1847 and was not concluded until 1926. Each house has its own election procedure and individual powers distinguishing them from the other, which are further discussed in the article for each individual house.

==Congress==

===Eligibility===
Each house has its own eligibility requirements established by the Constitution, but there are common rules of ineligibility and incompatibility (&quot;régimen de inhabilidades e incompatibilidades&quot;), determined by the Constitution.

Anyone who has been sentenced to deprivation of liberty (detention) at any time except for political crimes and culpable negligence; hold dual citizenship and are not native-born citizens; held a public employment position with political, civil, administrative or military authority or jurisdiction within the year prior the election; participated in business transactions with public entities or concluded contracts with them, or were legal representatives of entities which handled taxes or quasi-fiscal levies within the six months prior to the election; lost their mandate (&quot;investidura&quot;) as members of Congress or holds ties of marriage or kinship with civil servants holding civil or political authority may not be elected to Congress. In addition, relatives through marriage or kinship who are registered candidates for the same party for an office elected on the same day may not be members of Congress. The constitution also bans election to or membership in more than one office or body, even if the terms only overlap partially.
Members of Congress may not hold another public or private office (except university professorship); manage matters or conclude contracts, in their name or that of someone else, with public entities or persons administering taxes or serve as a member of any board or executive committee of decentralized public entities or institutions administering taxes.

Violations of the rules of ineligibility, incompatibility, conflict of interest lead to the loss of one&#x27;s mandate (&quot;investidura&quot;) as congressmen; as does an absence (during the same session) to six plenary sessions, failing to take their seat within eight days following the first meeting of the house, improper use of public funds or duly proven influence peddling. The Council of State rules on the loss of mandate within twenty days of the request made by a citizen or the executive committee of the appropriate house.

Members of Congress enjoy immunity for their opinions and the votes that they cast in the exercise of their office. For crimes committed during their term, only the Supreme Court of Justice may order the arrest and try them.

===Replacement of members===
Members of Congress do not have alternates (&quot;suplente&quot;) and are only replaced in the event of a temporary or permanent absences, as decreed by law, by the next non-elected candidate on the list from which he/she was elected, ranked in order of registration or votes received. Permanent absences include death, physical incapacity, nullification of the election, justified and accepted resignation, disciplinary sanctions and the loss of one&#x27;s mandate. Temporary absences include maternity leave and temporary deprivation of liberty from crimes other than those signalled in the paragraph below.

In the wake of the parapolitics scandal, a political reform in 2009 created the so-called &quot;silla vacía&quot; (empty seat) mechanism, according to which anyone who has been sentenced for membership, promotion or funding of illegal armed groups; drug trafficking; intentional wrongdoing against the public administration or mechanisms of democratic participation or crimes against humanity cannot be replaced. Likewise, any congressmen who resigns after having been formally indicted in Colombia for any of these crimes or who is temporarily absent after an arrest warrant has been issued for any of these crimes is not replaced. These rules not only apply to Congress, but to all other directly elected bodies - departmental assemblies, municipal councils and local administrative boards. These provisions were strengthened by the 2015 constitutional reform, which added fraudulent wrongdoings against public administration as a crime not resulting in replacement.

===Shared powers===
Although each house of Congress serves a particular role and have individual powers distinguishing them from one another, both houses have certain powers in common, according to Article 135 of the Constitution; namely:

# Electing its executive committees and its secretary general for a two-year period
# Request from the government the information that the house may need, except information regarding diplomatic instructions and classified documents
# Determine the convening of sessions reserved to address oral questions by congressmen to cabinet ministers and the answers of the latter
# To fill the positions established by law necessary for the execution of powers
# Seek from the government the cooperation of government agencies to improve the performance of their duties
# Organizing its internal maintenance of order.
# To summon (by writing, with five days anticipation) and require ministers, permanent secretaries and heads of administrative departments to attend sessions. In cases the officials fail to attend without an excuse deemed reasonable by the house, the house may file a censure motion.
# Propose censure motions against ministers, permanent secretaries and heads of administrative departments for matters related to their official duties or for ignoring the summons of Congress. A censure motion must be tabled by at least a tenth of the members of the respective house, and the vote takes place after the conclusion of a debate with a public hearing of the respective official. Approval of the motion requires an absolute majority, and, if successful, the official is removed from office. If unsuccessful, no new motion on the same matter may be proposed unless it is supported by new facts. The decision of a single house is binding on the other.
# Commissions of either house may also summon any natural or juridical person to testify (in writing or orally) during a special session on matters directly related to investigations pursued by the committee (Article 137).

===Joint sessions===
The Congress meets as a single body (&quot;Congreso pleno&quot;) only on exceptional occasions, determined by article 18 of Law 5 of 1992. These occasions are:

# Inauguration of the President of the Republic, or the Vice President when acting as President
# Receive foreign heads of State and government
# Election of the Comptroller General
# Election of the Vice President in the case of a vacancy
# Recognizing the physical incapacity of the Vice President
# Electing magistrates of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Superior Council of the Judiciary
# Deciding on censure motions against cabinet ministers

In joint sessions of Congress, the President of the Senate acts as President of the Congress and convenes, chairs and directs the session.

===Sessions===
The Congress meets twice a year in two ordinary sessions: the first from 20 July to 16 December, and the second from 16 March to 20 June. These two sessions form a single legislative year, legally known as a legislature (&quot;legislatura&quot;), of which there are four during the course of a single congressional term.

The executive branch can call for extraordinary sessions at any time, but never after 20 June in an election year, and Congress may only discuss the issues submitted for its consideration by the government during these sessions.

===Commissions===
Each house elects permanent commissions, whose number, composition and responsibilities are determined by law. These commissions, whose existence stems from the Constitution, are known as permanent constitutional commissions and there are currently 14 in Congress - seven in each house. The current permanent commissions are:

* First commission (19 senators, 35 representatives): responsible for constitutional amendments, statutory laws, constitutional rights and duties, territorial organization, regulation of control organisms, peace, structure organization of the central administration, ethnic affairs and other administrative matters.
* Second commission (13 senators, 19 representatives): responsible for foreign policy, defence, the military and police, treaties, diplomatic and consular appointments, foreign trade, borders, citizenship, immigration and aliens, military service, public honours and monuments, harbours and other foreign trade matters.
* Third commission (15 senators, 29 representatives): responsible for finance, taxes, monetary policy, central bank, authorization of loans, monopolies, economic regulation, national planning, financial markets, stock markets, insurance and savings.
* Fourth commission (15 senators, 27 representatives): responsible for budget laws, fiscal supervision, disposition of national goods, industrial property, patents, trademarks, management of national public institutions and offices, quality and price control for administrative contracts.
* Fifth commission (13 senators, 19 representatives): responsible for agriculture, the environment, natural resources, land management, fishing and maritime affairs, mining and energy.
* Sixth commission (13 senators, 18 representatives): responsible for communications, fees, public calamities, service delivery, communications media, scientific and technological research, radio and television, geostationary orbit, digital communication and computer systems, air space, public works and transport, tourism, education and culture.
* Seventh commission (14 senators, 19 representatives): responsible for civil servants, trade unions, mutual aid societies, social security, benefits, recreation, sports, health, community organizations, housing, economic solidarity, women and the family.

Legal commissions are those created by the law, responsible for specific matters outside the competence of the constitutional commission. Three legal commissions exist in both houses - human rights, ethics and congressional rules and document accreditation; two legal commissions exist only in the House of Representatives - public accounts and the investigation and accusation commission. In addition, there are special commissions and incidental commissions.

==Senate==

The Senate has 102 elected members for four-year terms.

===Electoral system===
According to the Colombian Constitution, 100 senators (&quot;senadores&quot;) are elected from a single national constituency. The remaining two are elected in a special national constituency for Indigenous communities. The current threshold in order to obtain seats is 3% of valid votes nationally.

===Eligibility===
To be a senator, a person must be a natural-born Colombian citizen over the age of 30 at the time of the election. Representatives of indigenous communities seeking election as a representative of indigenous communities in the Senate must have held a traditional authority role in their community or have been the leader of an indigenous organization.

===Exclusive powers of the Senate===
# Approve or reject the resignations of the President and the Vice President.
# Approve or reject all military promotions conferred by the government on commissioned officers.
# Grant leaves of absence for the President in cases other than sickness, and determine the qualification of the Vice President to serve as President. 
# Allow for the transit of foreign troops through Colombian territory.
# Authorize the Government to declare war on a foreign nation. 
# Elect the Constitutional Court justices. 
# Elect the Attorney General.
# Take cognizance of the charges brought by the House of Representatives against the President (or whoever replaces him/her) and members of the &quot;Comisión de Aforados&quot; even if they may have ceased to exercise their functions. The Senate determines the validity of the charges concerning actions or omissions that occurred in the exercise of these duties, and adopts disciplinary measures if need be. The Senate&#x27;s impeachment powers are limited, as the Constitution explicitly states the punishments which may be imposed, and, the accused faces trial before the Supreme Court of Justice for common crimes.

==Chamber of Representatives==
The House has 166 elected members for four-year terms.

===Electoral system===
The House of Representatives is elected in territorial constituencies, special constituencies and an international constituency.

Each department (and the capital district of Bogotá D.C.) form territorial electoral constituencies (&quot;circunscripciones territoriales&quot;). Each constituency has at least two members, and one more for every 365,000 inhabitants or fraction greater than 182,500 over and above the initial 365,000. For the current legislative term (2014-2018), 161 of the 166 House members are elected in territorial constituencies.

There are also three special constituencies, electing the remaining five members: one for Indigenous communities currently with one representative, one for Afro-Colombian communities (&quot;negritudes&quot;) currently with two representatives and one for Colombian citizens resident abroad currently with one representative. As a result of the 2015 constitutional reform, the number of seats allocated to Colombian citizens resident abroad will be reduced to one, from 2018 onward, as an additional special seat will be created for the territorial constituency of Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina to represent the archipelago&#x27;s Raizal community.

The current threshold in order to obtain seats is 50% of the electoral quotient (total votes divided by total seats) in constituencies with over two seats and 30% of the electoral quotient in constituencies with two seats. Seats are then distributed using the distributing number, or &quot;cifra repartidora&quot; method explained in article 263 of the Constitution.

===Eligibility===
To be a representative, a person must be a Colombian citizen (by birth or naturalization) over the age of 25 at the time of the election.

===Exclusive powers of the House===
# Elect the Ombudsman.
# Examine and finalize the general budgetary and treasury account presented to it by the Comptroller General.
# Bring charges to the Senate, at the request of the investigation and accusation commission, for the impeachment of the President (or whoever replaces him/her) and members of the &quot;Comisión de Aforados&quot;.
# Take cognizance of complaints and grievances presented by the Attorney General or by individuals against the aforementioned officials and, if valid, to bring charges on that basis before the Senate.
# Request the aid of other authorities to pursue the investigations.

==Legislative process==
Congress&#x27;s main power is to enact, interpret, amend and repeal laws (Article 150). Under this responsibility, some of its specific legal powers include approving the national development plan and related appropriations, defining the division of the territory, determining the structure of national administration (including creating, merging or abolishing ministries, departments and other national public institutions), authorizing the conclusion of contracts, loans and asset sales by the government; vesting the President with exceptional powers to issue decrees with force of law for a six-month period; establishing national revenues and expenditures; ratifying international treaties signed by the government and granting amnesties or commutations for political crime (with a two-thirds majority).

===Types of laws===
The Constitution differentiates between several different types of laws.

Organic laws (&quot;leyes orgánicas&quot;) regulate legislative activity, including the rules of Congress and both houses, the budgetary process and the approval of the national development plan. Their approval requires an absolute majority of the members of both houses (Article 151 of the Constitution).

Statutory laws (&quot;leyes estatutarias&quot;) regulate fundamental rights and duties and the procedures for their protection; the administration of justice; political parties and movements; electoral regulations; mechanisms for citizen participation (plebiscite, referendum etc.); states of exception; the military criminal justice system and electoral equality before major presidential candidates. Their approval, amendment and repeal require an absolute majority of the members of both houses and must be completed within a single legislative year. This procedure also includes prior revision by the Constitutional Court (Article 152).

Legislative acts (&quot;actos legislativos&quot;) amend the Constitution, and they may be presented by ten members of Congress although they may also be introduced by the government, 20% of municipal councillors and departmental deputies or a number of citizens equivalent to at least 5% of registered voters. The procedure for their approval is longer, as they must be approved in two consecutive ordinary sessions. Legislative acts are not the only method to amend the Constitution, nor does Congress hold exclusive powers of constitutional amendment.

===Legislative initiative===
Bills may originate in either house at the proposal of their respective members. However, legislative initiative is not limited to members of Congress. Bills may be proposed by the government through the appropriate minister(s); the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Justice, the Council of Judicial Government, the Council of State, the National Electoral Council, the Inspector General, the Comptroller General and the Ombudsman may also propose bills on matters related to their duties. Finally, a number of citizens equivalent to at least 5% of registered voters at the time or 30% of municipal councillors or departmental deputies also hold legislative initiative under article 155, and these bills benefit from an accelerated procedure (see below).

The above notwithstanding, in certain cases bills may only be initiated by the government (see the second paragraph of article 154). Bills related to taxes may only be introduced in the House of Representatives and those involving international relations may only be introduced in the Senate.

All bills introduced must comply with certain requirements; among others, a title and number, articles and a statement of motives explaining the importance of the bill and the reasons for it.

===Legislative procedure===
Upon the bill&#x27;s introduction, the presidents of both houses decide to which permanent constitutional commission the bill will be sent. Once sent to a commission in each house, the chair of said commission will assign one or more member as speaker (&quot;ponente&quot;), who will study the bill and present a report (&quot;ponencia&quot;) on the bill&#x27;s benefits (or lack thereof), potential improvements to be made or recommending that the bill be rejected. Upon publication of this report, the commission as a whole meets for debate and discussion on the contents of the report. The commission votes on the bill. A bill rejected during this first debate may be reconsidered by the respective house at the request of its author, a member of the house, the government or a spokesperson in case of a popular initiative.

If the commission approves the bill, the commission&#x27;s chair will again assign speakers, charged with reviewing the bill further and presenting a report for a second debate in the plenary of either house. The report is published for debate in the respective house, and the speaker explains to the full house the bill and the report. Similar to what happens during the first debate in commission, the floor is open to debate and testimony, followed by discussion of the bill in its entirety or by article. If the bill is approved by the house, it is sent to the other house, where it follows the same process through the equivalent commission and later to the floor of the house.

Between the first and second debates, a period of no less than eight days must have elapsed, and between the approval of the bill in either house and the initiation of the debate in the other, at least 15 days must have elapsed (Article 159).

A bill which has received a first debate but not completed the procedure in one legislative year will continue the process in the subsequent legislative year, but no bill can be considered by more than two legislatures.

In the case of differences between the versions approved by the two houses, a conciliation commission made up of an equal number of members of both houses is formed to re-conciliate both texts, or, if not possible, decide by majority vote on a text. The text chosen by the commission is sent to the floor of both houses for debate and approval. If differences persist, the bill is considered defeated (Article 161).

Once a bill has been approved in two debates in each house, the bill is sent to the government (President) for its approval. The Colombian President formally lacks veto power, but may object to a bill and return it to the houses for second debates. The delay for returning a bill with objections is 6 days (no more than 20 articles in the bill), 10 days (21-50 articles) or 20 days (over 50 articles). If the prescribed delay expires without the government having returned the bill with its objections, the President shall approve and promulgate it. If the bill is again adopted by an absolute majority of the members of both houses, the President must sign the bill without objection. However, if the President objected to the bill for unconstitutionality, the bill will be sent, if the houses insist, to the Constitutional Court. The Court then has six days to rule on the bill&#x27;s constitutionality; a favourable ruling forces the President to sign the bill, an unfavourable decision defeats the bill.

The President may solicit the urgent or accelerated passage of a bill, by which the respective house must take a decision within a 30-day period (Article 163). In addition to this urgent procedure, it is also constitutionally established that priority is given to bills ratifying human rights treaties (Article 164).

A number of citizens equivalent to 10% of registered voters may request a referendum for the repeal of a law. The law is repealed if an absolute majority of voters so decide, as long as turnout is over 25%. No referendums may be held on international treaties duly ratified, the budget or laws pertaining to fiscal and tax matters (Article 170).

<text>Lyndhurst is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 36 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Casey and Greater Dandenong local government areas. Lyndhurst recorded a population of 8,926 at the 2021 census.

Lyndhurst Post Office opened on 1 January 1867 and closed in 1976.

After the Bracks government&#x27;s decisions to abandon plans for a toxic waste dump near Mildura, the continued use of the existing Lyndhurst facility was part of the replacement plan.

The Casey side of Lyndhurst lies inside the Urban Growth Boundary, and the development phase is almost complete. The Greater Dandenong side (to the west of the Western Port Highway) is outside the Urban Growth Boundary and is semi rural, and forms part of the South Eastern green wedge.

In 2009, the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development purchased a 3.5-hectare site within Marriott Waters and earmarked the site for Lyndhurst Primary School. The Prep to Year 6 primary school opened in 2011 and was built under the Partnerships Victoria in Schools Model which has seen the school built and maintained through public–private partnership arrangements between the Victorian state government and Axiom Education.
Lyndhurst railway station was located in the suburb on the Cranbourne line, but did not see any passenger traffic. Freight traffic to the cement facility ended in 2009. Passenger rail in the area is now serviced by Lynbrook or Merinda Park stations.

<text>Noble Park is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 25 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Greater Dandenong local government area. Noble Park recorded a population of 32,257 at the .

Noble Park has a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial zones and is home to a highly multicultural population, with residents who have emigrated from Europe, Asia, the Americas, and Africa.

==History==

The history of Noble Park as a suburb in Melbourne began in 1909. Allan Buckley nicknamed the land subdivision Nobel Park after the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel, as Buckley had used the estate to demonstrate Nobel&#x27;s explosives, but the name was soon transformed to Noble Park by common usage.

Early settlement was encouraged by building a community centre, church, school, postal centre and later, a railway station. The postal centre was opened in August 1910 and the railway station was completed in July 1912, but in the early days, the town&#x27;s growth was relatively slow due to the lack of population growth in the area. In the early 1920s, the Railway Department set up a poultry farm and eventually a plant nursery was set up in the eastern part of the suburb. The focus of the small community was based around its local town hall.

In the 1980s Noble Park became known for its infamous street gangs that carried out violent crimes against the community, as well as the scene of a major shootout between members of the Victoria Police and Pavel Marinof, a burglar on the run. Residential growth in the second half of the century saw an end to the grazing paddocks and market gardens. By the 1990s, 56% of Noble Park&#x27;s population was born overseas, with the largest being from Great Britain and Ireland, followed by Bosnians, Italians and Greeks; and South and Southeast Asians (including Indians, Sri Lankans and Vietnamese), according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In recent years there has been an upsurge of migrants and refugees settled from North African countries, especially Sudan.

=== Today ===
Recent years have witnessed substantial investment by local and state governments, including the Paddy O&#x27;Donoghue Community Complex which opened in 2006, the redevelopment of Noble Park Railway Station and the construction of the Aquatic Centre which is home to Melbourne&#x27;s largest water slide. Public amenities include number of schools, as well as churches, temples and mosques. Noble Park&#x27;s primary commercial district contains bakeries, cafés, restaurants and convenience stores. Noble Park has an active Rotary Club and an active Rotaract Club.

Being formerly market gardens, Noble Park has fertile soil and to this day still has many River Red Gum trees.

==Demographics==

The suburb is characterised by similar social conditions to those across Greater Dandenong, including high levels of migrant settlement and cultural diversity, relatively low incomes, elevated rates of early school leaving, low-medium crime rates and a high density of apartments. The 2011 Census recorded that 60% of Noble Park residents were born overseas, the same as for Greater Dandenong and nearly twice the corresponding metropolitan percentage (33%). Among the 121 birthplaces of residents were India, accounting for 9% of residents, Vietnam (8%) as well as others such as Sri Lanka, Cambodia, China, Bosnia, Afghanistan and Sudan.

Rates of migrant settlement are correspondingly high, with 7% of residents having arrived in Australia within the previous 2.5 years – the same as for Greater Dandenong. Languages other than English are spoken by about three-fifths of residents (61%) – twice the metropolitan average. Reflecting this diversity of languages, 13% of Noble Park residents have limited fluency in the use of spoken English, much the same as for the municipality, and over three times the metropolitan level of 4%. Patterns of religious faith are similar to those seen across the municipality, with 18% of residents adhering to Buddhism, 4% following Hinduism, and 9% Islam.

Contemporary educational outcomes are marked by a high rate of early school leaving, with 13% of young adults (20–24 years) having left school before completing year 11 – equivalent to the municipal average, but higher than the metropolitan level, of 10% Median individual gross incomes, recorded in the Census, stood at 68% of the metropolitan median - similar to municipal levels, which are the lowest in metropolitan Melbourne.

Among the 10,200 homes in Noble Park, a third are apartments - twice the proportion of metropolitan Melbourne. Sixty per cent of homes in the suburb are owned or being purchased by their occupants - less than the corresponding metropolitan level of 71%.

==Transport==
===Public transport===
==== Trains ====
Noble Park has two suburban railway stations on the Pakenham/Cranbourne line of the Melbourne rail network:
* Noble Park railway station at the town centre, servicing the shopping strips alongside Douglas Street.
* Yarraman railway station at the suburb&#x27;s southeastern neighbourhoods (also unofficially known as &quot;Noble Park East&quot;), just west of the EastLink overbridge.

==== Buses ====
Noble Park is serviced by three bus services operated by Ventura Bus Lines:
* Route 709, to Mordialloc.
* Route 811, to Dandenong railway station and Brighton.
* Route 815, to Dandenong railway station.
There are also six other bus routes that traverses parts of the suburb, including:
* Route 800, on Princes Highway to Dandenong railway station and Chadstone Shopping Centre.
* Route 812, to Dandenong railway station and Brighton.
* Route 813, to Dandenong railway station and Waverley Gardens Shopping Centre.
* Route 824, to Keysborough and Moorabbin railway station.
* Route 978 Night Bus, night service on Princes Highway from Dandenong railway station to Elsternwick railway station.
* Route 979 Night Bus, night service on Heatherton Road from Dandenong railway station to Elsternwick railway station.

===Bicycle trails===
The Djerring Trail (Caufield–Dandenong Rail Trail), completed in 2018, is connected to the Noble Park railway station, as well as to Noble Park&#x27;s skate park and aquatic centre.

The EastLink Trail, after crossing the Princes Highway, closely follows the Yarraman Creek and crosses the Pakenham/Cranbourne line railway via the Yarraman station footbridge, before continuing on along the Mile Creek after the two creeks join each other.

==Community facilities ==
* Noble Park Public Hall, located on Buckley Street just off the shopping strip.
* Giac Hoang Temple, a Vietnamese Buddhist temple, is located in the suburb.

==Environment==
* The middle-lower section of the Miles Creek, a small second-order right-bank tributary of the lower Dandenong Creek system and the last before the latter becomes the Patterson River, flows obliquely through the centre of Noble Park just north of the town center. Majority of the creek within Noble Park is concrete-lined and its value is mostly hydrological (as a flood control channel) rather than ecological, except in its very last section east of Chandler Road.
** The Yarraman Creek, a small urban stream flowing south from Noble Park North and the only tributary of the Miles Creek, forms the suburb&#x27;s eastern boundary with the neighbouring Dandenong West. The creek, though small and often partly dry, has two groups of retention ponds along its course and is surrounded by linear parks and forested open space reserves, providing most of the ecological functions of the Miles Creek catchment. The Yarraman railway station servicing Noble Park East is named after this creek.
* Noble Park has fertile soil and to this day still has many river red gum trees, including the oldest river red gum at Parkfield Reserve, which is classified by the National Trust of Australia.

==Sport==
The Noble Park Aquatic Centre, located just northwest of the town centre and the train station, is home to Melbourne&#x27;s largest water slide. A former swimming pool of the Aquatic Centre, just off Heatherton Road, was converted into the Noble Park Skatepark.

Noble Park has a local Australian rules football team, the Noble Park Bulls, competing in the Eastern Football League. It also includes a cricket and lawn bowls club.

Noble Park is represented by Southern Stars FC soccer team. The team currently competes in the Victorian State League Division 1 which is the third tier in Australia behind the A-League and the Victorian Premier League.

Noble Park is also home to the Parkfield Netball Club, Noble Park United FC - Drina, and Parkfield Cricket Club.

Both Noble Park Tennis Club and Noble Park Community Tennis Club represent Noble Park in tennis.

Noble Park home to the Noble Park Skate Park located on Memorial Drive (off Heatherton Road). The skate park was designed and built by a team led by Noble Park resident and pro skater John McGrath. It is a unique skate park in Melbourne&#x27;s south east and includes a plaza, snake-run and bowl. It is adjacent the Noble Park Aquatic Centre to the west on Memorial Drive, which currently has a heated outdoor pool, an indoor heated pool, a water slide and a water play area. The 50 m outdoor pool is partially shaded and provides ramp access, and is occasionally converted into two 25 m pools.

==Notable residents==
* John Farnham Australian singer and songwriter
* Darren Millane Australian rules football
* Stephen Milne Australian rules football
* Adam Ramanauskas Australian rules football player
* Glenn Archer Australian rules football
* James Gwilt Current Australian rules football
* Adam Treloar, Australian rules footballer

<text>Murray Adaskin, (March 28, 1906 – May 6, 2002) was a Toronto-born Canadian violinist, composer, conductor and teacher. After playing violin with a band, he studied composition and became the director of the Music department of the University of Saskatchewan. Many of his compositions were written while in Victoria after his retirement.

==Life==

Born in Toronto, Ontario, to Jewish Latvian immigrant parents who raised their four children to become persevering kids, Adaskin studied the violin with Alexander Chuhaldin at the Toronto Conservatory of Music. He began his career playing the violin in silent film presentations in his native city. Afterwards, he was a violinist with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra from 1923 to 1936. He married his first wife, soprano Frances James, around that time. From 1938 to 1952 he was with the Royal York Hotel trio. Adaskin attended the Music Academy of the West in 1950.

By 38 years of age, he studied for seven years with John Weinzweig to become a composer. Other composers he studied with include Charles Jones and Darius Milhaud. He was head of the Department of Music at the University of Saskatchewan from 1952 to 1966, including four years as conductor of the Saskatoon Symphony Orchestra. He then became the Composer-in-Residence until 1972, the first position of its type ever created at a Canadian university. Among his notable pupils were composers Boyd McDonald, Paul Pedersen, Rodney Sharman and Timothy Williams; and violinist Andrew Dawes. By 1972, he retired to Victoria where he started composing more than half his total of 130 compositions.

Adaskin lost his first wife in 1988, to later remarry to a woman named Dorothea Larsen, who was his helping hand in recording some pieces on their own label. He died in 2002, just before the release of two CDs of a five-disc collection for his memory. He is the brother of Harry Adaskin, Leslie Adaskin and John Adaskin.

It was announced on December 15, 1980, that he was awarded the Order of Canada. On April 8, 1981, Adaskin was invested as an Officer of the Order of Canada.

==Music inspiration==

Igor Stravinsky was a major inspiration for Adaskin. &quot;Stravinsky&#x27;s neo-classical and rugged rhythms echo through his work.&quot; Additionally, his training as a violinist affected his sense of melody. Through his works, one can feel the presence of landscapes, birdsongs and different local surrounding sounds.

The melody of his compositions often seem abstract, similar to Canadian visual art from his early years. His avid interest in Canadian visual art was expressed in his work: &quot;In Praise of Canadian Painting in the Thirties&quot;.

<text>Hippos () or Sussita (Aramaic, ) is an ancient city and archaeological site located on a hill 2 km east of the Sea of Galilee, attached by a topographical saddle to the western slopes of the Golan Heights.

Hippos was a Hellenistic city in the northern Jordan Valley, and a long-time member of the Decapolis, a group of ten cities more closely tied to the Greco-Roman culture than to the local Semitic-speaking population. Later, Hippos became a predominantly Christian city, which declined towards the end of the Byzantine period and throughout the Early Muslim period, and was abandoned after the 749 earthquake.

==Geography==

Hippos was built on a flat-topped foothill east of and above the Sea of Galilee, above sea level, near modern Kibbutz Ein Gev.

Besides the fortified city itself, Hippos had two harbor on the Sea of Galilee and a large area of the surrounding hinterland (Hippos&#x27; Territorium).

== Etymology ==
The city was founded in the mid-second century BCE as &quot;Antioch of Hippos&quot; () Hippos is Greek for horse and a common name among Seleucid monarchs. In the 5th-7th century Mosaic of Rehob, the site is identified by its Aramaic name, Sussita () also meaning &quot;horse&quot;. In Arabic it is Qal&#x27;at al-Ḥiṣn or Qal&#x27;at al-Ḥuṣn () meaning &quot;Fortress of the Horse/Stallion&quot;. Alternate spellings include Hippus, a Latinized version of the Greek name.

==History==
Archaeological evidence shows habitation at Hippos from the Early/Middle Chalcolithic period.

===Hellenistic period===

The site was re-inhabited in the third century BCE by the Ptolemies, though whether it was an urban settlement or a military outpost is still unknown. During this time, Coele-Syria served as the battleground between two dynasties descending from captains of Alexander the Great, the Ptolemies and the Seleucids. It is likely that Hippos, on a very defensible site along the border lines of the 3rd century BCE, was founded as a border fortress for the Ptolemies. The city of Hippos itself was established by Seleucid colonists, most likely in the middle of the second century BCE. Its full name, &quot;Antiochia Hippos&quot; (), reflects a Seleucid founding.

As the Seleucids took possession of all of Coele-Syria, Hippos grew into a full-fledged polis, a city-state with control over the surrounding countryside. Antiochia Hippos was improved with all the makings of a Greek polis: a temple, a central market area, and other public structures. The availability of water limited the size of Hellenistic Hippos. The citizens relied on rain-collecting cisterns for all their water; this kept the city from supporting a very large population.

In the first century BCE, the Hasmonean ruler Alexander Yanai conquered the city. According to the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, the inhabitants were converted to Judaism.

===Roman period===

In 63 BCE the Roman general Pompey conquered Coele-Syria, including Judea, and ended Hasmonean independence. Hippos was known as one of the Decapolis and was incorporated into the Roman &quot;Provincia Syria&quot;. Under Roman rule, Hippos was granted a certain degree of autonomy. The city minted its own coins, stamped with the image of a horse in honor of the city&#x27;s name.
Hippos was given to Herod the Great in 27 BCE, and returned to the Province of Syria at his death in 4 BCE. According to Josephus, during this time Hippos, a pagan city, was the &quot;sworn enemy&quot; of the new Jewish city across the lake, Tiberias. Josephus recounts that during the First Jewish–Roman War of AD 66–70, following the destruction of the Jews in Scythopolis, the Jews of Hippos suffered a massacre. Other Jews from Hippos joined the revolt in Tarichaea.

After the Romans put down the Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt, they created the province of Syria Palaestina in 135, of which Hippos was a part. In the early 2nd century CE Hippos reached its peak of prosperity and growth. 
The city was built along a grid pattern, centered around a colonnaded &quot;decumanus maximus&quot; running east–west through the city as early as the mid-1st century CE. Other monuments included a &quot;Kalybe&quot; (a shrine to the Emperor), a theatre, an odeon, a basilica, and new city walls. The most important improvement, however, was the aqueduct, which led water into Hippos from the El-Al stream in the Golan Heights, 24 km long each aqueduct. The water, collected in a large, vaulted cistern, allowed a large population to live in the city.

During the Late Roman period, the imperial restructuring under Diocletian placed Hippos in the province of Palaestina Secunda, encompassing Galilee and the Golan.

===Byzantine period===
When Christianity became officially tolerated in the Roman Empire, giving rise to what is called by historians the Byzantine period, Palestine became the target of imperial subsidies for churches and monasteries, and Christian pilgrims brought additional revenue.

Christianity came slowly to Hippos. There is no evidence of any Christian presence before the 4th century. Gradually, the city was Christianized, becoming the seat of a bishop by at least 359. One Bishop Peter of Hippos is listed in surviving records of church councils in 359 and 362.
Dedication inscriptions by two deaconess, one in Greek and one in Christian Palestinian Aramaic from nearby ‘Uyūn Umm el-‘Azam stand for Christian presence and their active worship by female clerics who officiated in these churches.

=== Rashidun and Umayyad periods ===
The Muslim armies of the Rashidun period invaded Palestine in the 7th century, completing their conquest by 641. Hippos&#x27; new Arab rulers allowed the citizens to continue practicing Christianity, a policy then continued by the Umayyad Caliphate. According to archaeologists, the Islamic regime did not pull down the churches but Christian imagery engraved on Byzantine brass bread stamps and chancel screens was covered over with a paste of tin and lead.

Hippos was abandoned after the 749 Galilee earthquake.

==Archaeology==
===1880s surveys===
G. Schumacher visited the ruin in 1883–1885, giving a protracted account of Hippos (&quot;Kŭlat el Husn&quot;) in his work, &quot;The Jaulân&quot;, although he had incorrectly surmised that the site may have been the ancient Gamala described by Josephus.

===1950s excavations ===
The first excavations were carried out by Israeli archaeologists Emmanuel Anati, Claire Epstein, Michael Avi-Yona and others from 1951 to 1955. They unearthed some domestic buildings, the main city gate at the east and a large Byzantine church that had probably been the seat of Hippos&#x27; bishop. After the excavations, the Israel Defense Forces used Mount Sussita for the same purpose as the ancient Greeks—as a fortress. It was used as a border defense against Syria until much of the Golan Heights were captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.

In 1964 Mt. Sussita was declared a national park and in 2004 the area around it, including the site itself, were declared a national reserve.

===From 1999===
Following an archaeological survey conducted in 1999, the site has been excavated annually. The research undertaken at Hippos-Sussita is an international project. The first eleven seasons (2000–2010) were an Israeli–Polish–American collaboration co-directed by Arthur Segal and Michael Eisenberg from the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, University of Haifa; Jolanta Młynarczyk from the Research Centre for Mediterranean Archaeology, Polish Academy of Sciences; Mariusz Burdajewicz of the National Museum, Warsaw; and Mark Schuler from Concordia University, St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. The main areas of excavation were the odeon, the Roman basilica, the North-West Church, the North-East Church and its surrounding insulae, domestic quarters, the southern bathhouse, the eastern defensive ditch and fortifications next to it and the necropoleis (burial grounds). From 2012 the excavations were directed by Eisenberg, focusing on the Roman basilica, the Roman-Byzantine southern bathhouse, the north-east insula, the living quarters and the Roman bastion. From 2016, Arleta Kowalewska joined the directorship and the team focuses on the street network, saddle compound and saddle necropolis.

In 2010, the objective was to excavate the streets, public buildings and domestic quarters, as well as the two necropolis located to the south and the southeast of the city. The relationship between the city and the surrounding countryside would be the focus of subsequent digs, especially the area stretching between the city and the lake. A detailed survey of the lake shore to establish the exact location of Hippos&#x27; port was also planned.

===2015 findings===

In 2015 a large bronze mask, almost without equal for its dimensions and dated between the 1st century BCE and the 2nd century CE, depicting the Greek god Pan was retrieved by archaeologists from the site.

==Christian tradition==
In the New Testament, when Jesus mentions a &quot;city set upon a hill&quot; that &quot;cannot be hidden&quot; (one of the metaphors of Salt and Light in the Sermon on the Mount), he may have been referring to Hippos, although there have been speculations that he referred to Safed. In addition, a miracle of Jesus recounted in Mark 5 and Luke 8 may also be related to Hippos (). See Gergesa for a discussion of the location of this miracle.

Catholic mystic Maria Valtorta in her vision-based work &quot;Poem of the Man God&quot; asserted that Jesus Christ visited and preached in Hippos.

<doc id="611286" wikidata="Q926643" url="?curid=611286" title="Manikongo">
<text>Manikongo (also called Awenekongo or Mwenekongo) was the title of the ruler of the Kingdom of Kongo, a kingdom that existed from the 14th to the 19th centuries and consisted of land in present-day Angola, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The manikongo&#x27;s seat of power was Mbanza Kongo (also called &quot;São Salvador&quot; from 1570 to 1975), now the capital of Zaire Province in Angola. The manikongo appointed governors for the provinces of the Kingdom and received tribute from neighbouring subjects.

The term &quot;manikongo&quot; is derived from Portuguese , an alteration of the KiKongo term (literally &quot;Lord of Kongo&quot;). The term , from which is derived, is also used to mean kingdom and is attested with this meaning in the Kongo catechism of 1624 with reference to the Kingdom of Heaven. The term is created by adding the personal prefix to this stem, to mean &quot;person of the kingdom&quot;.

 is attested in very early texts, notably the letters of King Afonso I of Kongo, where he writes, to Portuguese kings Manuel I (in 1514) and João III concerning the () and twice concerning the . was used to mean not only &quot;king&quot; but also anyone holding authority, so provincial and sub-provincial officials also were called . Afonso did not entitle himself Manikongo, but rather (king of Kongo). 

Subjects were required to prostrate themselves before the Manikongo, approaching him on all fours, and when time came for the Manikongo to eat or drink, an attendant would chime two iron rods, cueing them to lay face-down so that they could not see him do so.

<text>Springvale is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Greater Dandenong local government area. Springvale recorded a population of 22,174 at the .

Springvale is a large suburb occupying , bounded by Westall Road to the west, Princes Highway and Police Road to the north, the Springvale Crematorium and Corrigan Road to the northeast, Heatherton Road to the south and Lawn Road to the southeast. Springvale is linked to the Melbourne CBD by Monash Freeway via the Ferntree Gully Road exit to the suburb&#x27;s northwest.

==History==

The area that is now Springvale has been inhabited by the Woiwurrung and Boonwurrung people for tens of thousands of years.

The municipal area of Springvale is at the doorstep of the Dandenong Ranges National Park. The area contained natural springs which were a permanent water source for stock and travellers moving between Melbourne and Dandenong, giving rise to the suburb&#x27;s name.

In the 1840s, Springvale was the residence of Christian Ludolph Johannes De Villiers; a South-African leader of the Native Police. De Villiers founded an inn &#x27;No-Good-Damper&#x27; in the area which was infamous for bushranger attacks. No-Good-Damper was named for the practice of locals killing Aboriginal people by lacing sacks of flour with poison; some Aboriginal people chose to steal flour for food as settlers displaced them from their hunting grounds.

In the 1850s, a Spring Vale Hotel was built by Matthew Bergin near a newly surveyed route between Oakleigh and Dandenong at what is now the intersection of Princes Highway and Springvale Road. However, it did not develop into a settlement. Nearby, a blacksmith shop and a rest house for travellers was established by the Young Family.

The first Springvale Post Office opened on 12 September 1864 and closed in 1892. This office had been superseded by Springvale Railway Station office (opened 1887) which was renamed Springvale in 1902. A Springvale North Post Office was also open between 1946 and 1978.

In 1886, land was subdivided near the railway station and the area began to grow. By the 1920s, the Spring Vale community had a lodge, brass band, a recreation reserve, a mechanics&#x27; institute, a few shops and some houses in the township. A picture theatre opened in 1924. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Springvale was a pastoral, residential and industrial township with market gardens in the surrounding areas. Sand extraction industries were active, lasting until the 1990s.

The clearest indication of postwar residential growth occurred in the early 1960s when Rockman&#x27;s Shopwell department store was built, and later when shops on the east side of Springvale Road were removed for road widening. Housing growth was rapid and estates with made roads and services replaced unserviced subdivisions. The new Sandown Racecourse site was opened in 1961 for both horse and motor-car racing.

During the 1970s and 1980s, many Vietnamese people moved to Springvale as a result of displacement during the events in the Vietnam War. Today, they make up the largest ethnic group in the area and Springvale is renowned for its Vietnamese shops, markets, and community. Nonetheless, Springvale is one of the most diverse suburbs in Australia.

Springvale was once a city in its own right, but a local government boundary reshuffle in December 1994, saw part of the municipality amalgamated into the City of Greater Dandenong and the rest merged into the new City of Kingston.

==Geography==

On the north of the Princes Highway is the Springvale Crematorium and Necropolis. Next to the Crematorium is an area of housing and the original Springvale primary school near where Centre and Springvale Roads cross Princes Highway.

The suburb is mostly residential, although some small industrial areas are scattered through the suburb&#x27;s northwest and northeast. Eastern Springvale contains Springvale Crematorium and Necropolis, one of Melbourne&#x27;s three main cemeteries, and the Sandown motor raceway.

==Demographics==
The residents of this suburb have higher levels of migrant settlement, cultural diversity and more limited English proficiency than Greater Dandenong, lower median incomes and lower rates of early school-leaving. The 2011 Census found that 69% of Springvale residents were born overseas, higher than for Greater Dandenong and more than double the corresponding metropolitan proportion (33%). Among the 99 birthplaces of its residents were Vietnam (21%), India (11%), Cambodia (5%) and China (5%). Rates of migrant settlement are relatively high, with 8% of residents having arrived in Australia within the previous 2.5 years – similar to the figure for Greater Dandenong, of 7%.

Languages other than English are spoken by 79% of Springvale residents – compared with 64% for Greater Dandenong. 22% have limited fluency in the use of spoken English, higher than the municipal level of 14% and over five times the metropolitan level of 4%. Among the major religious faiths are Buddhism, adhered to by 27.3% of residents, and Catholicism (21%).

9% of young adults (20–24 years) had left school before completing year 11 – lower than both the municipal average of 13% and the metropolitan level, of 10%.

Median individual gross incomes of $352 p.w., recorded in the Census, are the lowest in Greater Dandenong and equivalent to 55% of metropolitan levels.

Of the 6,489 homes in Springvale, 16% are flats, less than the proportion across Greater Dandenong of 21%, though more than the metropolitan level of 11%. 61% of homes are owned or being purchased by their occupants – less than the metropolitan level of 71%.

==Politics==

Springvale has been a very safe electoral district for the Australian Labor Party at both federal and state elections.

===Federal===
At federal level the suburb is divided between the federal divisions of Hotham, currently held by Clare O&#x27;Neil, and Bruce, held by Julian Hill, both incumbent Labor representatives.

===State===
Springvale is now all in Mulgrave, held by state premier Daniel Andrews, with a large margin.

===Local===
Springvale was divided between the Springvale Central and Springvale North wards of the City of Greater Dandenong, represented respectively by Youhorn Chea (a councillor since 1997) and Alan Gordon. Springvale and Springvale South now form most of the Lightwood Ward of the City of Greater Dandenong.

==Facilities==

Springvale Neighbourhood House was established in 1983 with the aim of providing a resource centre for self-help, social, cultural and action groups. Over 40 self-help groups meet at the house, including ESL, Computer and Horticulture classes and celebrations such as Refugee Week, Sumnation and Adult Learners Week.

There are many large religious centres in Springvale including several Buddhist temples, Christian churches and a Greek Orthodox church.

The Sandown Racecourse is co-located with the motor raceway, and is one of the four horse racing venues in Melbourne. On the other (southwestern) side of the Pakenham-Cranbourne line railway is the Sandown Park Greyhound Racing Track, one of the most (if not &quot;the&quot; most) prestigious greyhound racing venue in Victoria and Australia, and hosts the prominent events such as the TAB Melbourne Cup.

The Victorian branch of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (SSAA) operates the SSAA Springvale Range – the only handgun/rifle shooting range in metropolitan Melbourne that is open daily to non-licensed members of the general public, located on the north side of the Princes Highway just west of the Springvale Botanical Cemetery. The range consists of two outdoor rifle ranges (though only one is regularly available) that allow only air rifles and .22 LR rimfire rifles, as well as one indoor airgun range and four handgun ranges. It is one of the main shooting sport and police training facilities in Victoria, and also hosts the separately administered Sporting Shooters Pistol Club (SSPC), the state&#x27;s second largest handgun club (after the Oakleigh Pistol Club in Clayton South).

<text>King Lot , also spelled Loth or Lott (Lleu or Llew in Welsh), is a British monarch in Arthurian legend. He was introduced in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; as King Arthur&#x27;s brother-in-law, who serves as regent of Britain between the reigns of Uther Pendragon and Arthur. He has appeared regularly in works of chivalric romance, alternating between the roles of Arthur&#x27;s enemy and ally, and is often depicted as the ruler of Lothian and either Norway or Orkney. His literary character is probably derived from hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern, which features Leudonus as king of Leudonia (the Latin name for Lothian) and father of Saint Teneu.

Lot is generally portrayed as the husband of Arthur&#x27;s sister or half-sister known by many names but most often as Anna, Gwyar, or variants of Morgause. The number and names of their children vary depending on the source, but usually they prominently include Gawain as well as other sons and sometimes daughters. Geoffrey suggests Lot as also the biological father of Mordred, and the much later prose romances identify him as the father of Gawain&#x27;s younger brothers Agravain, Gaheris and Gareth while turning Mordred into an incestuous son of Arthur.

==Origins==
A king of Lothian named Leudonus or Leudon of Leudonia can be found in both Latin and Welsh sources. A hagiography fragmentary, &quot;Vita Kentigerni,&quot; features Leudonus as the maternal grandfather of Saint Mungo (Kentigern). In this text, Leudonus has his daughter Teneu thrown from a cliff when he discovers that she had been raped and impregnated by Owain mab Urien. However, she survives the ordeal with divine protection and goes to Saint Serf&#x27;s community, where she gives birth to Mungo. The story of Saint Mungo is placed around a century after the timeframe generally associated with Arthur. Welsh sources refer to Leudonus as Lewdwn or Llewdwn Lluydauc (&quot;L[l]ewdwn of the Host&quot;) and make him king of the Gododdin people in the region of Hen Ogledd.

Geoffrey of Monmouth seems to refer to this earlier figure in the king whom he called Lot or Loth in his early 12th-century manuscript &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;. His sources are obscure, but the choice of name is probably based on its similarity to &quot;Lodonesia&quot;, a Latinized name for Lothian. This toponymical connection parallels Geoffrey&#x27;s association of King Leir with Leicester and Coel with Colchester, as well as William of Malmesbury&#x27;s assertion that Gawain was king of Galloway, following a common idea of medieval historiography that places took their names from people. An explicit connection between Leudonus and Geoffrey&#x27;s Lot was made in 1521 in John Major&#x27;s &quot;Historia Maioris Britanniae&quot;, which named Kentigern&#x27;s mother as Thametes, the daughter of Lot and sister of Gawain.

Llew ap Cynfarch (Lleu son of Cynfarch) shares his name with the figure Lleu Llaw Gyffes, probably a euhemerized deity known from the Four Branches of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;, though the extent of this connection is conjectural. Lot was also identified with the Welsh mythology hero Lludd Llaw Eraint.

The name Lot may be connected to the Norse name Ljot, which appears in Norse sagas and was known in Orkney. The Old Norwegian name Ljot was common in the Galte clan, who ruled Orkney and parts of Scotland before the Sinclairs. In Hardanger, the Lothe family, close kin to the old Galte clan, also used a raven banner. Lot may also be linked to the Highland Scottish standing stone called the Stone Lud.

==Arthuriana==
In &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae,&quot; Lot is one of three brothers, each of whom rules a part of northern Britain: Lot rules Lodonesia and is the lord of Carlisle, while his brothers Urien (the father of Owain, both generally reckoned historical kings of Rheged) and Angusel rule over Mureif (Moray) and Scotland, respectively. Lot is first mentioned as a vassal to Uther Pendragon in the wars against Octa, the Saxon king of Kent. When Uther falls ill, he marries his daughter to Lot and entrusts the couple with control of the kingdom. Lot and Anna have two sons, Gawain and Mordred. When Arthur becomes king, he helps Lot and his brothers regain their territories, which have fallen to the Saxons. Lot is also the heir to the throne of Norway, as the nephew of its previous king, Sichelm. With Arthur&#x27;s aid, he takes the kingdom from the usurper Riculf. Lot later leads one of Arthur&#x27;s armies in his war against Emperor Lucius of Rome.

In the wake of Geoffrey, Lot entered into Welsh Arthurian tradition under the name Lleu or Llew. The Welsh Triads maintain Geoffrey&#x27;s association between Lot and Urien as brothers, drawing Lot into the historical Urien&#x27;s genealogical tradition as a son of Cynfarch and Nefyn, the daughter of Brychan Brycheiniog. His wife in Welsh literature is Arthur&#x27;s sister Gwyar, mother of Gwalchmei (Gawain). 

Early Arthurian works of chivalric romance, such as those of Chrétien de Troyes, often refer to Lot, but he rarely receives more than a mention in connection to his son Gawain. &quot;De Ortu Waluuanii&quot; and &quot;Les Enfances Gauvain&quot; tell of how the teenage Lot fell in love with Uther Pendragon&#x27;s young daughter Anna while serving as her page. The story takes place during the time when he was a royal hostage at the court of Uther after the first British conquest of Norway. German stories by Wolfram von Eschenbach and Der Pleier give Gawain a brother, Beacurs (Beatus), and several sisters, including Cundrie (Gundrie), Itonje (Itoni), and Soredamor (Surdamur), born from Arthur&#x27;s sister named Sangive or Seife. Some works, such as &quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,&quot; feature Lot as a member of Arthur&#x27;s court. In the Alliterative &quot;Morte Arthure&quot; and the Didot &quot;Perceval&quot;, Lot dies in Arthur&#x27;s final battle against Mordred.

Lot takes a more prominent role in the cyclical narratives of the early 13th century. In these works he is the king of Lothian and Orkney, probably due to his earlier association with Norway. In the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; prose cycle, Lot of Orcania (Orkney) is the son of Hedor (Hector), the king of Lothian, and an unnamed daughter of the king of Norgales (North Wales, possibly meaning Gwynedd). After Uther marries Igraine, he marries off the daughters from her first marriage to his political allies. Her oldest daughter, appearing under different names but best known as Morgause (possibly a variant of Morgan), is married to King Lot. He and Morgause have five sons: Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth, as well as Mordred (whose biological father is Arthur from an incestual relationship with his sister). Later, when the young Arthur comes to power, Lot raises an army in rebellion alongside his brothers and several other Brittonic kings. After Arthur defeats the rebel coalition at Bedegraine and helps fend off the Saxons, Lot becomes Arthur&#x27;s ally.

Beginning with the Prose &quot;Tristan&quot;, the Post-Vulgate Cycle offered a different version of Lot&#x27;s story. As in the &quot;Lancelot-Grail&quot; cycle, Lot opposes Arthur until his defeat at Bedegraine. Afterward, Arthur hears a prophecy that a child born on May Day is destined to destroy him. Arthur gathers up all babies born around that time, including his own illegitimate son, Mordred, and puts them on a rudderless boat that sinks, and the children are believed to have all died. Lot, who believed Mordred to be one of his own sons, joins Arthur&#x27;s enemy King Rience and resumes his campaign against Arthur. Eventually, he is killed in battle by King Pellinore enabled by the intervention of Merlin. Lot&#x27;s death sparks a long blood feud between their families, leading to the revenge killings of Pellinore and most of his sons, as well as the murder of Lot&#x27;s wife. This version of Lot&#x27;s story was taken up by Thomas Malory for &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, in which Merlin notes Lot (originally Lote) of Orkney as Arthur&#x27;s strongest early enemy and that Lot must be killed on the day of their battle for Arthur to live. The subsequent Lot-Pellinore clan feud arguably constitutes one of the three main plot strands of Malory&#x27;s work (alongside the sacred Grail Quest and the relationship between Lancelot and Guinevere) and has appeared in a number of modern Arthurian works.

While Lot&#x27;s realm is usually placed south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall (in post-Roman Lothian), Scottish late-medieval chronicles, including Hector Boece&#x27;s &quot;Historia Gentis Scotorum&quot;, cast him as both king of the Picts and a Pict himself. This association has carried on to some works of modern Arthurian legend.

<text>Vekoma Rides Manufacturing is an amusement ride manufacturer. Vekoma is a syllabic abbreviation of Veld Koning Machinefabriek (Veld Koning Machine Factory) which was established in 1926 by Hendrik op het Veld.

==History==
The company originally manufactured farm equipment and later made steel constructions for the coal mining industry in the 1950s. As business shifted from farming equipment to steel construction, Veld Koning Machinefabriek was shortened to Vekoma. After the closure of Dutch mines in 1965, Vekoma manufactured steel pipes for the petrochemical industry. In the 1970s Vekoma was contracted by U.S. amusement ride manufacturer Arrow Development to build the steel structure for its roller coasters in Europe. As demand increased, Arrow instructed Vekoma in track building techniques and eventually licensed its coaster-building technology. In 1979 Vekoma entered the market on its own, opening three coasters in Europe under the name Vekoma Rides Manufacturing BV.

On 23 August 2001, Vekoma filed for bankruptcy.

In 2006, Vekoma formed an alliance with U.S.-based manufacturer Chance Morgan. Chance Rides represented Vekoma in North America and Chance Morgan manufactured the steel track for select projects. During this agreement, Chance built four Vekoma-designed family coasters.

In 2008, Vekoma Rides Manufacturing acquired the Wheels of Excellence range of Ferris wheels from Ronald Bussink. Under the agreement, Bussink continued to supply wheels 100 meters and taller. Smaller wheels in the 40- to 80-meter range transitioned to a new manufacturing division of Vekoma, Dutch Wheels BV.

On 17 October 2012, Chance Rides and Vekoma discontinued the agreement to produce rides together for the North American market. However, shortly after terminating that agreement, Chance Rides was given an exclusive license from Dutch Wheels BV to manufacture and sell R60 wheels in the North American market under a new affiliate, Chance American Wheels.

On 30 March 2018, Vekoma was acquired by Sansei Technologies, the parent company of American ride manufacturer S&amp;S Sansei. The conditions stipulated that Vekoma&#x27;s business model remain unchanged after the acquisition. Vekoma continues to manufacture and market rides as a separate entity.

==Roller coasters==

<text>Jesus People USA (JPUSA) pronounced: ǰ-pu-sa is a Christian intentional community in Uptown, on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois. 

JPUSA emerged from Jesus People Milwaukee in 1972, and maintains one of the largest continuing communities (100–450 members) produced by the Jesus movement. In 1989, JPUSA joined the Evangelical Covenant Church as a member congregation, and currently has eight pastors credentialed with the ECC. The community organized the annual Cornerstone Festival from 1984 until 2012.

== Background ==

Today, Jesus People USA is &quot;one of the largest single-site communes in the United States&quot; and is certainly one of the few communes with such an eclectic cultural mix of hippies, punks, &quot;crusties&quot; and other members from various subcultures.

&quot;Cornerstone&quot; magazine and the Christian rock band the Resurrection Band are part of the JPUSA community. In recent years, Resurrection Band disbanded, but Glenn Kaiser continues touring and playing, both solo and with the blues-based GKB (Glenn Kaiser Band). JPUSA also has its own recording company, Grrr Records. JPUSA was once the home of film producer/art promoter Anthony Cox (who was formerly the husband of Yoko Ono) and their daughter Kyoko, singer/songwriter Daniel Smith as well as bass player/vocalist Christian Wargo.

== Legacy and continued presence in Chicago ==

JPUSA&#x27;s social significance stems more from the group&#x27;s continued presence in Chicago and its historic roots in the 1960s, according to sociologist Shawn Young. It is one of the most contemporary significant groups from the Jesus movement era:

Founded in 1972, this community is one of the most significant surviving expressions of the original Jesus Movement of the sixties and seventies and represents a radical expression of contemporary countercultural evangelicalism. JPUSA&#x27;s blend of Christian Socialism, theological orthodoxy, postmodern theory and ethos of edgy artistic expression (as demonstrated at their annual music festival) prove what some scholars have longed suspected: evangelicalism is a diverse, complex movement, which simply does not yield to any attempt at categorization.
== Controversy ==

=== Enroth controversy ===

In 1993, JPUSA elders learned that Ronald Enroth was researching a sequel to his book &quot;Churches That Abuse&quot;, which was said to mention issues of abuse within JPUSA. Despite efforts of elders to convince Enroth to edit JPUSA out of the book, it was published in 1994 and included a full chapter of accounts of alleged abuse within the group. The release of the book set off a &quot;firestorm of debate among religious scholars.&quot; JPUSA elders referred to the book as &quot;poison in the well.&quot; Ruth Tucker, a professor at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, defended the movement, saying Enroth was &quot;sadly misdirected and his research methods seriously flawed.&quot; Paul R. Martin, the director of Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center, one of the few residential treatment centers in the world for former members of &quot;abusive groups,&quot; supported Enroth&#x27;s findings, saying that his facility had seen a flood of requests for help from former members and that JPUSA &quot;displays virtually every sign that I watch for in overly authoritarian and totalistic groups.&quot; Ronald Enroth himself responded to JPUSA in the book, in part, with:

There has been much correspondence between leaders of the Covenant Church and JPUSA and me since I began to do the research for this book. They have questioned the integrity of my reports, the reliability of my respondents, and my sociological methodology, but I have conducted more than seventy hours of in-depth interviews and telephone conversations with more than forty former members of JPUSA. They have also largely discounted the reports of abusive conditions past and present in the JPUSA community. ... Unwilling to admit serious deficiencies and insensitivity in their pastoral style, the leaders of JPUSA have instead sought to discredit the former members who have cooperated with my research efforts.

According to a later newspaper article, as a result of the book&#x27;s mention of JPUSA, &quot;scores&quot; of members decided to leave the group.

=== &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; criticism ===

In 2001, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published a two-part article primarily critical of the movement, with quotes from several ex-members accusing the group of authoritarian practices. One of the JPUSA activities criticized in the article includes &quot;adult spankings,&quot; employed after charismatic leader Jack Winters introduced it as a means to heal the &quot;inner child.&quot; The practice, which lasted approximately four years in the mid-1970s, was abandoned by the group, with leaders citing it as reflective of how &quot;spiritually immature&quot; the group was at the time.

JPUSA issued a response to the two-part article, found on their website, which accuses the article of &quot;anti-religious bias and cultural intolerance.&quot;

=== Accusations of sexual abuse ===

A lawsuit was filed in January 2014 against JPUSA and its parent denomination, the Evangelical Covenant Church, claiming that children were sexually abused by members of JPUSA and its leadership covered it up for years. &quot;No Place to Call Home&quot; is a documentary that shares the stories of former children of JPUSA members who allegedly were sexually abused. As of March 3, 2015, the case was dismissed for want of prosecution.

<text>Carrum Downs is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 48 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District via the Monash Freeway, located within the City of Frankston local government area. Carrum Downs recorded a population of 21,976 at the 2021 census.

Prior to December 1994 the majority of Carrum Downs was within the City of Cranbourne. However, following statewide local government reform, the suburb was moved to be part of a new, larger City of Frankston.

==History==
===Karrum Karrum===

Before European settlers arrived at Port Phillip, Aborigines resting after the stiff climb of Oliver&#x27;s Hill, Frankston, and looking north along the bay would have viewed a long ribbon of sandy beach shaped vaguely like a boomerang. The area was called Karrum Karrum, or as some of the early squatters interpreted it, Garem Gam, meaning &quot;Boomerang&quot;. The swampy marshland behind the sand dunes was a rich hunting ground teeming with wildlife.

===Carrum Swamp===
The Carrum Swamp measured approximately 15 km from north to south, and averaged about 5 km across from east to west. It was up to 8 km wide at the northern end. The high lands visible in the swamp were the Isles of Wannarkladdin, now Chelsea Heights. The swampland with its dense growth of swamp tea-tree and other vegetation was covered for the most part by the waters from the Dandenong, Eumemmerring, and other smaller creeks, with a total catchment area of approximately 430 km2, with the present townships of Langwarrin, Cranbourne, Berwick, Belgrave, Ferntree Gully, Olinda, Lilydale, Croydon and Ringwood forming its perimeter. Some of the waters eventually flowed through marshy country to the Mordialloc Creek or through to the Kananook Creek which flowed into the bay at Frankston.

The Carrum Swamp together with the larger Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp made a formidable barrier against the early explorers and land seekers in the early days.

===The birth of Carrum - allotments on the Long Beach===
The first survey of the Carrum swamp was made by T. E. Rawlinson, and completed by 2 January 1866. The only sign of European habitation reported by Rawlinson was a fisherman&#x27;s cottage occupied by John Watkins and his family near the present Watkins Grove, Aspendale. The survey between the swamp and the sea resulted in Mr Callinan, the State&#x27;s assistant surveyor, dividing the area into 18 allotments stretching from the Mordialloc Creek to the present Keast Park, Seaford. The land was referred to as the &quot;Allotments on the Long Beach&quot;, the first sales taking place at Semmell McCaul &amp; Co&#x27;s Auction Rooms at Collins Street, Melbourne, on 22 December 1865. The upset price was $6 per acre. Most of the land sold went to investors, but some development did take place near the already established fishing village of Mordialloc. Carrum Downs Post Office finally opened on 1 November 1909.

The land sold on the swamp side was bought by Hugh Brown who built his home &quot;Pine Vale&quot; near the site of the Mordialloc High School which was part of his property. He was 40 years a Councillor of the Shire of Dandenong and served as President of the Shire. He was famous for his &quot;Carrum&quot; potatoes which were sent to several States. When Hugh Brown started farming there were still wild cattle roaming the swamplands from the original squatting days of the later 1830s to the 1850s.

===The first settlement===
During the Great Depression, the Brotherhood of St Laurence built a settlement at Carrum Downs to provide food and shelter to suffering families. After World War II, the suburb was gradually redeveloped as a Village for aged persons.

===Botany Park and the redevelopment of Botany Bush===
A small section of Carrum Downs is sometimes referred to by locals as &quot;Botany Park&quot;, based on the name of a housing estate built during the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the first major development of its type in the area, land was subdivided into generous lots between the southern and northern perimeters of Ballarto and Hall Roads. The generous land allotments, affordability and proximity to Frankston attracted families to the suburb. Development was conducted by AV Jennings, which financed and built prominent signage reading &#x27;Botany Park&#x27; on the corner of Ballarto Road and Lyrebird Drive. The signage remains, although weather degradation and graffiti have degraded its appearance. During the early 1990s, the South Western quarter between Ballarto and Frankston-Dandenong Roads was known as &#x27;Botany Bush&#x27;. The area was redeveloped into housing during the late 1990s.

== Carrum Downs Bushfire ==
On the 6th of January 2018 a 15 year old girl intentionally lit a fire in Carrum Downs&#x27; Pines Flora and Fauna Reserve that destroyed the bushland and put homes in Carrum Downs, Skye, Frankston North and Langwarrin at risk.

==Architecture==

The suburb is a mixture of modern low scale dwellings with generous garden frontage and low scale fencing. During the 1990s, a large catchment of land remained as public park space, although this has subsequently been developed into housing. Housing construction continues in the suburb.

==Retail areas==
Carrum Downs is serviced by three shopping precincts, with a fourth bordering the suburb in neighbouring Seaford. The Carrum Downs Regional Shopping Centre is located on Hall Road in the centre of the suburb and is home to banks, a Woolworths Supermarket, a post office, chemist, newsagency plus 40 other shops including liquor shops, clothing stores, fast food outlets, restaurants and real estate agents. During 2014 a smaller format Bunnings store has opened to combat the opening of Masters just down the road. A full Bunnings Warehouse opened in 2015 at Frankston/Dandenong Road. In early 2015 development began at the eastern end of the shopping centre of a substantial extension housing a KMart specialty store.

During October and November 2014 a McDonald&#x27;s store was constructed.

The Local Village @ Carrum Downs is located on the Dandenong-Frankston Road and comprises approximately 12 shops including an IGA supermarket, restaurant, bakery, fast food shops, doctor&#x27;s office and pharmacy. Directly opposite the precinct is another small retail/business park.

Carrum Downs Plaza which opened in 2008, is located on the corner of McCormicks Road and Ballarto Road in the south of the suburb and includes 22 specialty shops as well as a Coles supermarket. There are doctor and dental practices, a pharmacy, take away, 2 liquor stores and a popular cafe.

==Health services==

Carrum Downs is serviced by three medical centres, two dental clinics, three pharmacies and a physiotherapy clinic. Hospital facilities are provided at nearby Frankston, about 10 minutes away.

The first large-scale General Practice medical service, the Carrum Downs Medical Centre, opened operations in Hall Rd in 1989. The medical centre moved into a substantial new 1000 m2 facility in December 2014. The site on which the medical centre operates is newly named the Carrum Downs Health Precinct, and comprises pathology and radiology services, retail pharmacy, dental services, a multi- disciplinary allied health service incorporating physiotherapy and a retail gymnasium, and a primary care skin cancer medical service in addition to the preexisting large general medical practice.

==Transportation==
* Rail: Carrum Downs has no direct access to rail services. The closest rail links are the Kananook and Seaford stations on the Frankston line, both approximately 12 minutes (by car) from the centre of Carrum Downs, or the Merinda Park and Cranbourne stations on the Cranbourne line, both approximately 16 minutes away.
* Bus: Carrum Downs is serviced by 3 local bus routes - 760, 833 and 832 - and one SmartBus service - 901 - which runs approximately once every 15 minutes Monday to Friday from Melbourne Airport to Frankston, passing through Carrum Downs via Dandenong-Frankston road.
* Road: Carrum Downs provides easy access to two major arterial roads. To the East of Carrum Downs, the Western Port Highway provides connectivity to Melbourne City in the north (via the South Gippsland Freeway and the Monash Freeway). In a southerly direction, the Western Port Highway leads to the Port of Hastings. To the West of Carrum Downs is the Nepean Highway, which runs south from Melbourne city to Portsea on the Mornington Peninsula, along the eastern shores of Port Phillip Bay. Also to the west is the Frankston Freeway, which travels from Chelsea Heights in the north to the Mornington Peninsula in the south. Carrum Downs is also close to the Eastlink Tollway, which opened on 29 June 2008. This runs from Rutherford Road in Carrum Downs (with travel further south provided by the Frankston Freeway) to Donvale in Melbourne&#x27;s north east. Eastlink connects with the Monash Freeway and should reduce travelling time and distance to the City of Melbourne. Development of EastLink has led to strong commercial and industrial growth in Carrum Downs alongside the route of the EastLink. Peninsula Link provides a freeway from the Eastlink/Frankston Freeway interchange, through Carrum Downs and then south to link with the Mornington Peninsula Freeway at Mount Martha. Since opening, Peninsula link has shortened travel times from Carrum Downs to Safety Beach on the Peninsula by about 20 minutes.

<text>Frankston ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Located south-east of the Melbourne city centre via the Monash Freeway and EastLink, it is in the local government area of the City of Frankston and serves as its administrative and activity centres.

Positioned on the eastern shoreline of Port Phillip, Frankston became a popular seaside destination of Melbourne in the 1880s. Its beach continues to be one of the most frequented in Victoria, and is recognised as one of the cleanest in Australia. Due to its proximity to the north of the eponymous wine and tourism region, the suburb is also referred to as the &quot;gateway to the Mornington Peninsula&quot;.

The traditional custodians of the lands on which Frankston is situated are the Boonwurrung people of the Kulin nation, to which it was an important source of fish and meeting place of the Mayone-bulluk clan for around 40,000 years. Colonisation of the area by Europeans began at approximately the same time as the foundation of Melbourne in 1835 and started as an informal fishing outpost supplying the growing settlement. It was formally established in 1854, when official land sales for a new village first took place on 29 May, and has subsequently given its name to its broader local government area since 1893.

Neighbourhood areas within the suburb are Frankston Central, Frankston East, Frankston Heights, Karingal, Long Island, Mount Erin and Olivers Hill. At the 2021 census, Frankston had a population of . Its demonym is Frankstonian.

==Toponymy==

The toponymic origins of Frankston are subject to conjecture, and of which there are four popular theories. One of the earliest of these theories (published in the &quot;Victorian Historical Magazine&quot; in March 1916) is that it was named after one of its early European settlers, Frank Liardet, who also became one of its first official land owners. The Liardets were prominent pioneers of early Melbourne and arrived aboard the &quot;William Metcalfe&quot; from England in 1839. Liardet&#x27;s father, Wilbraham, founded what is now the Melbourne inner suburb of Port Melbourne and the family established and managed hotels around Melbourne as well as the first mail service of the early township.

Frank Liardet settled in the Frankston area in 1847, after taking out a 300-acre depasturing license for land that is now the Frankston locality of Karingal. During this time, Liardet built the first wooden house in the Frankston area—which would later become part of his Ballam Park estate after the formal land sales of 1854. Prior to settling in the area, Liardet had also worked on the cattle run of the first Postmaster of the Port Phillip District, Captain Benjamin Baxter, which was located over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Langwarrin and Langwarrin South. By the time Liardet had taken out his depasturing license for the Frankston area in 1847 an unofficial fishing village was also developing around its foreshore.

Considering Frank Liardet&#x27;s early presence in the Frankston area, and his connections to the early mail services of Melbourne, it is plausible that &quot;Frank&#x27;s Town&quot; became nomenclature for describing the area and its unofficial village. As a consequence it is possible that the name of &quot;Frankston&quot; was further adapted from it when officially naming the village for its formal land sales in 1854.

However, in a letter to the editor of &quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper (published on 30 May 1916) a member of the Liardet family said that this was in fact not true. In the letter was excerpts of correspondence between the Liardet family and the Victorian state Department of Lands and Survey which refuted the theory. Instead, it puts forward the theory that Frankston was named after the Irish-born settler Charles Franks; who was the first European to be killed by Indigenous Australians in Melbourne.

Charles Franks arrived in Melbourne aboard the &quot;Champion&quot; from Van Diemen&#x27;s Land in 1836 and made a squatter&#x27;s claim to land on the western side of Port Phillip near Mount Cottrel (northeast of what is now the Melbourne outer-western suburb of Wyndham Vale). Franks&#x27; land neighboured that of the early Melbourne explorer and surveyor John Helder Wedge, which was managed by his nephew Charles Wedge—prior to him gaining a pre-emptive right to land license of his own for the Frankston area. The correspondence with the Department of Lands and Survey states that, at the time of surveying the area for the land sales of 1854, the name &quot;Frankston&quot; was probably suggested to honour the Wedge&#x27;s deceased former neighbour.

Another theory—that has become folklore—is that Frankston was named after a pub named &quot;Frank Stone&#x27;s Hotel&quot;. In 1929 the author Don Charlwood, a student of Frankston High School at the time, compiled a history of Frankston using both local records and oral sources supporting the theory (published in &quot;The Frankston &amp; Somerville Standard&quot; newspaper on 8 February 1930).

The pub to which Charlwood refers was originally named the Cannanuke Inn and was the first permanent building in the Frankston area. It was built by the pre-emptive Frankston settler James Davey in the 1840s. The Victorian Heritage Database states that it was located on the present site of the Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute; at 1 Plowman Place in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD). According to Charlwood, it was purchased by a &quot;Mr. Stone&quot; in the early-1850s who, after the birth of his son, &quot;Frank&quot;, renamed it &quot;Frank Stone&#x27;s Hotel&quot; and around which the village developed and also had its name adapted from for its formal land sales in 1854.

As there appear to be no licensing records for the Cannanuke Inn, it is difficult to determine if this is in fact true. However, Charlwood does mention that Stone had purchased the Cannanuke Inn from &quot;a man named Standring&quot;. Licensing records state that Benjamin Standring was the owner of the Frankston Hotel from 1857 to 1860. Also, according to the terms of his pre-emptive right to land licence, Davey did not have the right to sell or sub-let the Cannanuke Inn. It is therefore unlikely that Stone purchased or leased the Cannanuke Inn from Davey or Standring before the formal land sales for Frankston in 1854—and after which the name &quot;Frankston&quot; was already in use.

A more recent theory, put forward by the author and historian Michael Jones in his local history book &quot;Frankston: Resort to City&quot; (published in 1989), is that Frankston was named after the heroic British army general Sir Thomas Harte Franks. The theory is strengthened by the fact that a number of places near Frankston also have names that are derived or adapted from those of British army generals and statesmen (such as Cranbourne, Hastings, Lyndhurst, Mornington and Pakenham). Jones states that the Surveyor General of Victoria from 1853 to 1858, Sir Andrew Clarke, named all of these places.

==History==
===Pre-history===

====Indigenous history====

Prior to the foundation of Melbourne by Europeans in 1835, the area surrounding Port Phillip was originally populated by Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation for an estimated 31,000 to 40,000 years. Particularly, the Frankston area was inhabited primarily by the Mayone-bulluk clan from the Bunurong tribe of the Kulin nation.

The tribes of the Kulin nation were a nomadic people with no sedentary settlements. As a result, there is minimal physical evidence of their past. The Bunurong tribe in particular were mainly hunter-gatherers that maintained an ecologically sustainable tradition of travelling between areas of seasonally abundant resources. For the Mayone-bulluk clan; Kananook and Sweetwater creeks and the former swamps and wetlands of the Frankston area were rich sources of fish and eel as well as summer fruit and vegetables. An important meeting place for the Bunurong tribe clans of the greater Mornington Peninsula region was the present site of the Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute, at 1 Plowman Place in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD), which was used for corroborees and as a trading place.

Bunurong territory, of which Frankston is a part, stretches from the Werribee River in the western metropolitan area of Melbourne east to Wilsons Promontory in Gippsland and was referred to as &quot;marr-ne-beek&quot; (&quot;excellent country&quot;) amongst the Kulin nation tribes. According to the Indigenous Australian mythology of the Dreamtime, the Bunurong territory was created by the ancestor spirit &quot;Lohan&quot;. Patrilineally, all Bunurong tribe members are considered direct descendants of &quot;Lohan&quot;. The creator of the Kulin nation-proper was the deity eaglehawk spirit &quot;Bunjil&quot;, and the protector of its waterways and keeper of the wind was the trickster crow spirit &quot;Waa&quot;.

&quot;Bunjil&quot; and &quot;Waa&quot; are the two moiety totems that govern the kinship system of the Kulin nation tribes. The Mayone-bulluk clan of the Frankston area was closely linked through marriage to the Wurundjeri-balluk clan of the Melbourne city centre area, from the neighbouring Woiwurrung tribe, based on this system. Two wooden sculptures of eagles, inspired by &quot;Bunjil&quot;, by artist Bruce Armstrong; a 5-metre version on Mayone-bulluk clan land, erected on Young Street in Frankston in 2001, and a 25-metre version on Wurundjeri-balluk clan land, erected on Wurundjeri Way in Melbourne Docklands in 2002, are representative of this link.

The earliest recorded encounter of the Bunurong tribe with Europeans in the Frankston area was in early 1803, when Captain Charles Robbins sailed his ship the &quot;Cumberland&quot; into Port Phillip on the surveying expedition headed by Charles Grimes. On 30 January, Grimes went ashore at Kananook Creek in search of fresh water and made peaceful contact with &quot;around 30 of the natives&quot;—most likely members of the Mayone-bulluk clan.

Another possible encounter of the Mayone-bulluk clan with Europeans in 1803 was in late-December, with three convicts that had escaped from the failed settlement by Captain David Collins at Sorrento on the southern Mornington Peninsula. Among the escapees was William Buckley, who later lived with the Wadawurrung-balug clan from the neighbouring Wathaurong tribe of the Kulin nation for 32 years. After travelling north up the Mornington Peninsula for two days, Buckley describes coming to a creek that ran &quot;near to the bay&quot;—most likely Kananook Creek and Long Island in the Frankston area—where they encountered a &quot;large tribe of the natives...armed with spears&quot; but did not make direct contact.

The number of Bunurong tribe members at the time of contact with Europeans in the 1800s was estimated to be 300. James Fleming, a member of Charles Grimes&#x27; surveying expedition in early 1803, reported observing smallpox scars on members of the Kulin nation tribes he had encountered—indicating that an epidemic had affected them prior to 1803. Smallpox arrived in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 and reached the Port Philip area in 1790, via the first European settlement in Australia at Port Jackson, claiming at least half the population of the combined Kulin nation tribes.

Following permanent European settlement in 1835, another smallpox epidemic reduced the number of Bunurong tribe members to 83 by 1839. An influenza epidemic during the 1840s further reduced their number to 28 by 1850. The last full-blood member of the Bunurong tribe, &quot;Yam-mer-book&quot;, also known as Jimmy Dunbar (from the Ngaruk-Willam clan, which was geographically close to the Mayone-bulluk clan) who lived to the north of Frankston near Mordialloc, died of natural causes in 1877.

====European settlement====

Fishermen were among the earliest Europeans to unofficially settle the Frankston area following the foundation of Melbourne on 30 August 1835. Living in tents and wattle and daub huts on its foreshore and around the base of Olivers Hill, they would travel by boat to the early Melbourne township to sell their catches.

James Davey arrived in the Frankston area in 1840, gaining a 640 acre pre-emptive right to land license over what are now the suburbs of Frankston and Frankston South from Olivers Hill south to Daveys Bay. Davey built the Cannanuke Inn in the mid-1840s, which was the first permanent building in the Frankston area, and was located on the site of the present Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute at 1 Plowman Place in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD). He built the first permanent wooden house in the southern Frankston area located near Daveys Bay on Olivers Hill in 1851—which was originally known as &quot;Old Man Davey&#x27;s Hill&quot;.

In 1843 Frank Liardet, the eldest son of the early Melbourne settler Wilbraham Liardet, took out a 300-acre depasturing license for what is now the Frankston locality of Karingal. Liardet built the first permanent wooden house in the eastern Frankston area in 1847—which would later become part of his Ballam Park estate after the formal land sales of 1854.

Davey later partnered in the cattle run of Captain Benjamin Baxter, the first Postmaster and former Clerk of Petty sessions for the Port Phillip District, during the early-1850s. Their run covered the majority of what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Langwarrin and Langwarrin South. The fisherman James Oliver built his house on northern Olivers Hill around this time, so he could keep watch for schools of fish in the waters below, and after whom the locality is now known by its current name. The explorer and surveyor Charles Wedge also arrived around this time, gaining a pre-emptive right to land license over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Carrum Downs and Seaford.

Thomas and Grace McComb arrived in the Frankston area in 1852. Thomas assisted with the development of the local fishing industry, and Grace was the first nurse and midwife in the area. Thomas Ritchie arrived in 1854 and established a bakery that same year on what is now Nepean Highway in the Frankston CBD.

The central Frankston area was surveyed by Thomas Hanbury Permein for the Victorian colonial government in early 1854. The only pre-existing permanent building in Permein&#x27;s survey is the Cannanuke Inn. The plan for the new village of Frankston was drawn by James Philp from the Office of the Surveyor General of Victoria on 1 May 1854—with the Cannanuke Inn as a central point and located on Lot 1 of a block bordered to the west by Bay Street, to the north by Davey Street, to the east by Wedge Street (now Young Street) and to the south by a public reserve (now Plowman Place and Frankston Park). Philp&#x27;s plan consisted of 29 standard lots, 49 suburban lots, nine country lots of 430 acres, and also reserved place for a village centre that would eventually become the Frankston CBD.

The first formal land sales for the new village of Frankston took place on 29 May 1854. Frankston was gazetted in late-April of that year as being &quot;well watered with springs...the odour and flavour of the water being remarkable&quot;. The road to Melbourne was extended from Brighton to Frankston (now the Nepean Highway) with bridges over Kananook Creek and Mordialloc Creek in late 1854.

Liardet became one of the first official land owners in Frankston after the formal land sales—establishing his Ballam Park estate on the land that he had a depasturing license for. There is a popular theory (published in the &quot;Victorian Historical Magazine&quot; in March 1916) that Frankston was named after Liardet due to his earlier presence in the area.

===19th century===

Following the first formal land sales for the new village on 29 May 1854, on 12 December, Samuel Packham was granted the licence to establish the Frankston Hotel. Licensing records (and newspaper articles) suggest that it was located on what is now the northwest corner of Davey Street and Nepean Highway (the present site of the Pier Hotel). Packham advertised the Frankston Hotel as a country retreat, and employed a kangaroo tracker and organised game hunting expeditions from the hotel.

Charles Wedge established his Banyan sheep station on his pre-emptive right to land over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Carrum Downs and Seaford after the formal land sales of 1854, and James McMahon purchased lands over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Sandhurst and Skye at this time.

The first permanent brick house in Frankston was built at Ballam Park in 1855 and replaced the 1847 wooden house on the site. It was built by Frederick Liardet, the younger brother of Frank, and was designed in a French Colonial Gothic Revival style by their father Wilbraham. The house is listed on the Victorian and Australian heritage registries through the National Trust of Australia. It is now managed by the Frankston Historical Society which conducts tours of the house and also maintains a local history museum at the estate.

A site for a Church of England (Anglican) was reserved after the formal land sales. Located on the corner of what is now Bay Street and High Street in the Frankston CBD, the two acre site also included an area for a school as well as a temporary burial ground. A temporary hall was built in 1856 and served as both a place of worship and as a school (which later became the Woodleigh School). The first post office in Frankston opened on 1 September 1857 which also initially operated from the hall.

====Early economy====

Frankston&#x27;s fishing industry was further developed with the assistance of Thomas McComb, who funded the construction of Frankston Pier in 1857. Following a petition by residents, to the Victorian colonial Department of Public Works, the pier was extended into deeper water in 1863. A gaslamp was installed at the end of the pier and a lamplighter was also employed. Frankston Fish Company was founded in 1867, by a consortium of local businessmen including Thomas Ritchie, in order to transport the catches of local fishermen in bulk to the fish markets of the Melbourne city centre.

In 1870, Ritchie established his first general store on what is now the southwest corner of Playne Street and Nepean Highway in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD). Ritchies Stores is now the largest independent grocery chain in Australia—with its headquarters still located in the Frankston area.
On 15 November 1873, William Davey Jr., grandson of pre-emptive Frankston settler James Davey, applied for the license to establish the Bay View Hotel, on what is now the northeast corner of Davey Street and Nepean Highway (the present site of The Grand Hotel) in the Frankston CBD. It was constructed with a guest house which Davey had shipped from Jersey.

Following a petition by residents to the Victorian colonial Department of Education in 1873, headed by Grace McComb, the first government school in Frankston was built on Davey Street in 1874. The No. 1464 Frankston School (Which later became Frankston Primary School) opened on 1 November of that year with an initial enrolment of 45 students.

Mark Young purchased the Frankston Hotel on 13 August 1875 for £380, and renamed it the Pier Hotel (under which name it continues to operate). Young spent an estimated £3700 on improvements to the hotel, making it one of the finest in the colony of Victoria at the time.

In 1879, following a conference of city councils in inner-Melbourne, the Frankston area was chosen as the preferred site to replace the Melbourne General Cemetery. The roughly 3000 acre Crown land site was bordered to the north by Charles Wedge&#x27;s Banyan sheep station (over what are now the City of Frankston suburbs of Carrum Downs and Seaford), to the south by Frank Liardet&#x27;s Ballam Park estate (in what is now the Frankston locality of Karingal), and is now the suburb of Frankston North. Its south-west corner is described as being &quot;about a mile [1.6 km] north of the village of Frankston, and the same distance east of the beach&quot;.

Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute was established on the former site of the Cannanuke Inn, at what is now 1 Plowman Place in the Frankston CBD, in 1880. Its construction was funded by public donations, headed by a residents&#x27; committee, and supported by friendly and temperance societies including a Frankston group of Freemasons and the Independent Order of Good Templars, Independent Order of Rechabites and Manchester Unity of Oddfellows. Its foundation stone was laid by committee president Mark Young on 22 March of that year, and the building was opened on 24 May at a cost of £280.
On 16 March 1881, the Colonial Bank of Australasia (later the National Bank of Australia) was the first bank to open a lending branch in Frankston. It was located next to Mark Young&#x27;s Pier Hotel on what is now Nepean Highway. The first library in Frankston, the Frankston Free Library, opened at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute to mark its first anniversary. The first 400 books of the new library were a donation from the banker H.D. Larnach.

To service the proposed new metropolitan cemetery the railway line to Melbourne was extended from Caulfield to Frankston between 1881 and 1882. The first section from Caulfield to Mordialloc opened on 19 December 1881. The second section from Mordialloc to Frankston opened on 29 July 1882. The course of the railway line was directly influenced by the location of the proposed cemetery. From Mordialloc to Seaford it runs adjacent to what is now Nepean Highway—which was built over a 1000-year-old sand dune that once ran parallel to the coastline. After Seaford it curves inland eastwards to where a &quot;mortuary station&quot; was to be located (now Kananook railway station) near the border of the proposed cemetery, then continues to Frankston.

Due to concerns from undertakers about sandy soil and underlying granite at the Frankston site, the proposed cemetery was abandoned—which was later established in the Melbourne southeastern suburb of Springvale in 1901. It was also briefly considered as one of the possible sites to replace the Melbourne Benevolent Asylum in 1887—which was later established in the southeastern suburb of Cheltenham in 1911.

====Seaside resort====

Despite not becoming the site of the new metropolitan cemetery, Frankston benefited from its new railway line. The travel time to the Melbourne city centre was reduced from several hours by horse-drawn carriage to 90 minutes by steam train, making it a popular seaside destination for excursionists and weekend holidaymakers from the mid-1880s.

Mark Young constructed enclosed sea baths in 1883, on a bed of granite located roughly 100 metres off the coastline of Frankston Beach, at a cost of £950. They were connected to the coastline by a wooden pathway that led to a suspension bridge over Kananook Creek to Young&#x27;s Pier Hotel.

During this time, an article in &quot;The Argus&quot; newspaper on the growth of outer Melbourne (published 4 October 1884) describes Frankston as &quot;going ahead rapidly&quot; with &quot;50 to 60 new houses...[in] the last three years&quot; as well as having &quot;two hotels, a wine shop, four boarding-houses, three general stores, an ironmonger, two saddlers&#x27; shops [and] five brick-yards&quot;. Frankston&#x27;s Market Gardeners&#x27; and Fruit Growers&#x27; Association was founded around this time, in order to transport the produce of local farmers by steam ship to New South Wales and Tasmania, and the majority of trade for the Mornington Peninsula and Phillip Island, as well as south-west Gippsland, is also described as passing through Frankston.
On 8 December 1884, John Storey Petrie was granted the license to establish a third hotel in Frankston, the Prince of Wales Hotel, on what is now the southwest corner of Davey Street and Nepean Highway (the present site of Davey&#x27;s Bar and Restaurant) in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD). It was designed in the Victorian Queen Anne style and was constructed of bluestone and locally-made bricks.

The intersection of Davey Street and Nepean Highway with Young&#x27;s Pier Hotel (northwest corner), Davey&#x27;s Bay View Hotel (northeast corner) and Petrie&#x27;s Prince of Wales Hotel (southwest corner), became known as a &quot;hotel corner&quot; from the 1890s, and contemporarily as &quot;pub corner&quot;. Around 100 years later, in the mid-1990s, they were joined by a nightclub on its southeast corner.

Frankston Brick Company was founded in 1886, by a consortium of local businessmen including William Davey Jr. and Thomas Ritchie—most likely in order to capitalise on the Melbourne land boom during the mid-1880s—and was later publicly floated. It was the first large-scale employer in Frankston, consolidating the existing local brick-yards onto a single site close to Frankston Pier, and producing approximately 50,000 bricks a week.

The Victorian colonial government established a large military camp in what is now the City of Frankston suburb of Langwarrin in 1886, which aided in the growth of the Frankston area. The entrance to the Langwarrin Military Camp was located on the corner of McClelland Drive and Robinsons Road, and it is now the Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve.
By the mid-1880s, No. 1464 Frankston School was classified as a &quot;class 4&quot; school (approximately 250 pupils) and had previously been expanded with an extension to the existing wooden school house in 1880. Due to its growing enrolments, and following a petition by residents to the Victorian colonial Department of Education, an additional 20 x 30 feet brick school house was built in 1889. The brick school house is now operated as an education history museum by the Frankston Historical Society.

A new Anglican church building was opened on 5 February 1887. It was designed in a Victorian Gothic Revival style by the ecclesiastic architect Louis Williams and built at a cost of £474. The St. Paul&#x27;s Church of England was formally licensed as a place of worship on 21 February 1888, and the Frankston Parish of St. Paul was officially established on 7 February 1889.

The first Roman Catholic church, St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s, was officially opened by Archbishop Thomas Carr on 15 December 1889. Its initial site on Davey Street in the Frankston CBD cost £60. It was designed in a Victorian Free Gothic style by architectural firm Tappin, Gilbert and Denchy and was constructed of locally-made bricks. It was originally administered by the Dandenong Parish of St. Mary and later the Mornington Parish of St. Macartan.

On 20 October 1893, the broader Frankston area along with the eastern Mornington Peninsula riding of the old Shire of Mornington was incorporated as the Shire of Frankston and Hastings local government area, with the eastern Mornington Peninsula riding becoming the new Shire of Mornington. Early council meetings of the new shire were held at the Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute and the inaugural shire president was Cr. Edward McGurk.

===20th century===

The first hospital in Frankston opened at the turn of the 20th century, as the private day surgery and hospital of the British doctor and former Director of the Melbourne Pharmacy School Sidney Plowman. It operated from Dr Plowman&#x27;s residence, known as The Lofts (also known as the Plowman Residence), at 20 Davey Street in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD), until his death in 1937. The Lofts was designed as a Queen Anne style California bungalow by Blackett &amp; Rankin Architects and constructed of locally-made bricks. It is listed is on the Victorian and Australian heritage registries through the National Trust of Australia, and was restored and incorporated into the design of Frankston&#x27;s Australian Government Building, which was built around it in the 1990s. It currently houses the Frankston offices of the Australian Electoral Commission and the member of parliament in the Australian House of Representatives for the Division of Dunkley (of which Frankston is a part).

From 1909 the former proposed metropolitan cemetery site near Frankston was repurposed as a pine forest plantation by the Victorian state Forestry Commission. When most of the plantation was destroyed by a fire on 2 January 1955, the state Housing Commission established the Pine Forest housing estate (locally called &quot;The Pines&quot;) in 1958, and is now the City of Frankston suburb of Frankston North.

The new Commonwealth Postal Service (now Australia Post) opened its first office in Frankston on the southeast corner of Davey Street and Main Street (now Nepean Highway) on 12 September 1910. It was designed in an Edwardian style by the Victorian state Department of Public Works and constructed of brick. It was later remodelled with the addition of a telephone exchange in 1927, and expanded again in 1941. It ceased operation as a post office and telephone exchange in the mid-1980s, after which it was operated as a restaurant. Since the mid-1990s it has been operated as a nightclub. In 2013, its exterior was partly restored to its 1941 design.

====War-time====

Following the declaration of war on the German Empire by the British Empire, on 8 August 1914 (GMT), the first soldier to enlist from Frankston was Sergeant William Polglase on the same day (AEST). Of the soldiers from Frankston that were killed in action in World War I, 16 are listed on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial.

At the beginning of World War I the Langwarrin Military Camp near Frankston was used to detain around 500 German prisoners of war. A military hospital was later established at the camp in order to treat Australian soldiers returning with venereal disease from Egypt and France. Most of the prisoners of war were later transferred to Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney in 1915, however, some also stayed to work at the hospital and settled in Frankston upon their release. Between 1915 and 1916 research at the hospital halved the duration of venereal disease treatment and its cost. It also advanced the burgeoning field of occupational therapy in Australia by involving its patients in gardening and music. It became a state-of-the-art rehabilitation hospital, during this time—and also had pet animals, landscaped gardens and shrubbery, art and musical equipment as well as a band for its patients. The hospital closed in 1919, with the base eventually following in the 1970s. It is now the Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve. The ruins of the hospital&#x27;s fountain can still be found in the reserve.
The Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute was expanded in 1915, with a 22 x 50 feet brick addition to its street frontage, at a cost of £529. The 1915 brick addition is now the oldest extant part of the building after the 1881 hall section had to be rebuilt in 1956 due to fire safety concerns. It became the eighth building to receive a blue plaque from the Mechanics&#x27; Institute of Victoria in 2004. In 2009, Frankston City Council undertook a A$2.5 million restoration of the building to its 1915 design.

On 17 February 1916, following a poll of residents, the Frankston Gas Company was granted permission by the shire&#x27;s council to establish &quot;electric light and power&quot; across the Shire of Frankston and Hastings.

Frankston&#x27;s reputation as a holiday destination increased particularly after the electrification of the railway line on 27 August 1922, which reduced the average travel time from 90 to 62 minutes. During this time, the broader Frankston area developed into a playground for Melbourne&#x27;s affluent and a regional capital for the greater Mornington Peninsula region. In part due to an increase in visitors during this time, the Frankston Life Saving Club was established on Frankston Beach in 1924.

On 2 February 1923, the Rt. Hon. Stanley Bruce, the member of the Parliament of Australia representing the Division of Flinders (of which Frankston was a part at the time) and the Treasurer of Australia, who lived at Pinehill (also known as Bruce Manor) in Frankston, was elected the eighth Prime Minister of Australia following the resignation of the Rt. Hon. Billy Hughes. Pinehill was built in 1926 and designed in a Spanish Mission style by architectural firm Prevost, Synnot &amp; Rewald with Robert Bell Hamilton. It is listed on the Victorian and Australian heritage registries through the National Trust of Australia.

The Roman Catholic Parish of St. Francis Xavier in Frankston was officially established on 4 November 1926. The old church was doubled in its size and a pipe organ built by George Fincham &amp; Sons was installed in 1927. A school was also established the following year (which later became St. Francis Xavier Primary School).

St. Paul&#x27;s Church of England was substantially enlarged in 1933, at an estimated cost of £3500. New north and south transepts, a chancel, sanctuary, vestries, and a chapel of St. Richard, were all added in a sympathetic Gothic Revival style by its original architect Louis Williams. The design incorporated the 1887 nave of the church, and also planned for a tower at its western end. Its foundation stone was laid by Archbishop Frederick Head.
In 1935, the Frankston area was chosen to host the first Australian Scout Jamboree. It was the only Australia jamboree attended by the founder of the Scouting movement Sir Robert Baden-Powell. A number of streets in the Frankston area are named after the jamboree. The original jamboree grandstand remained at Frankston Park for over 70 years until it was destroyed by a fire on 12 February 2008 (a replica of the old grandstand was later built on its site in 2010). Following the jamboree, the Frankston Yacht Club was officially established in 1937.

The first public hospital in Frankston, the Frankston Community Hospital, was established at 2 Hastings Road in 1941. Now named Frankston Hospital, it is the largest of four hospitals in the suburb and is also the chief provider of acute secondary and tertiary care in the broader City of Frankston area and the greater Mornington Peninsula region.

During World War II, the Commander of the First Australian Army in the Pacific theatre (from 1940 to 1945) and the Commander-in-Chief of Australian Military Forces in occupied Japan (from 1945 to 1950) was the Frankston-born Lieutenant General Sir Vernon Sturdee.

In 1946, J. R.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Pratt established his first grocery store in Frankston that would later become one of the largest supermarket chains in Australia as a subsidiary of American-owned Safeway Inc. Pratt was studying engineering at RMIT when he took a summer job at a grocery store in Frankston in 1945. He eventually bought the store the following year, renaming it Pratt&#x27;s Stores, and developed it into one of the first supermarkets in Australia in the 1950s. He also expanded to two more supermarkets in nearby Mornington and Chelsea during this time. It was the opening of his Chelsea supermarket that caught the attention of representatives from Safeway, who were in Australia sourcing apples, as it was officially opened by media personality (and Frankston resident) Graham Kennedy. Safeway entered Australia by merging with Pratt&#x27;s Stores in 1962. As managing director of Safeway&#x27;s Australian subsidiary, Pratt grew the chain to 126 supermarkets across eastern Australia by 1985. It was then bought by Australian-owned Woolworths Limited in 1985, who retained the successful Safeway brand in Victoria for 23 years, before rebranding all its stores as Woolworths in 2008.

====Post-war====

The population of the broader Frankston area boomed during and after World War II increasing from 12,000 in 1947 to 82,000 by 1982 (according to the former 1893 Shire of Frankston and Hastings borders). This was in part due to the establishment of government housing estates in the area to house the families of Australian Military Force personnel stationed at the Langwarrin Military Camp in the City of Frankston suburb of Langwarrin as well as at the Balcombe Army School in Mount Martha and the Flinders Naval Depot near Hastings. The plastics manufacturer Nylex also established its operations in Frankston in 1947, and became one of the largest employers in the area for 50 years, until its operations were downgraded in the mid-2000s.

During the early 1950s, Frankston was briefly home to the Hartnett Motor Company. Following his resignation as managing director of General Motors-Holden (GMH) in 1948, Laurence Hartnett was approached by then Prime Minister of Australia the Rt. Hon. Ben Chifley to establish an Australian-owned car company to compete with American-owned GMH in Australia. At GMH, Hartnett was &quot;the father of the Holden&quot;—the first Australian-made car. 70 acres between Seaford and Frankston was selected for the site of the factory with the support of the Victorian state government in 1949. The Hartnett Tasman was a front-wheel drive two door sedan based on a design by Jean Grégoire. The company planned to produce 100 cars a month at its Frankston factory. However, due to the delayed delivery of parts from the Australian federal government&#x27;s Commonwealth Engineering Company, production was also severely delayed. The first Hartnett Tasman was dispatched from the factory in March 1952. 125 Tasmans and its convertible version, the Hartnett Pacific, were dispatched before the company went into receivership due to its delays in September 1952. The rare Frankston-made cars are now collector&#x27;s items.
On 7 October 1954, a new 600-seat St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church was officially opened by Archbishop Daniel Mannix. It was designed in a Post-War Modern style by architect Alan G Robertson and was constructed of smooth-faced brick. Its Modernist style was designed to emphasise its two stained glass windows created by artist Alan Sumner. The main north window was reputed to be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere at the time of its installation. The 1927 George Fincham &amp; Sons pipe organ was refurbished in 1977. The old church was used as classrooms for St. Francis Xavier&#x27;s school until it was demolished in the 1970s.

On 26 October 1957, St. Paul&#x27;s Church of England was extensively damaged by fire, leaving only its sanctuary intact. Designs for the re-building of the damaged sections of the church was again completed by its original architect Louis Williams. However, he decided to use a more restrained Gothic Arts and Crafts style for the rebuild. The transepts, chancel, sanctuary, vestries and chapel from the 1933 design were retained, but the 1887 nave was beyond repair and was demolished. The new designs included a nave with multiple gabled bay windows with stained glass designed by mural artist Christian Waller (wife of Napier Waller) and a restrained version of the tower from the 1933 design. The foundation stone for the rebuilt church was again laid by Archbishop Frederick Head, and it was constructed of clinker brick in 1959.
In the summer of 1959, &quot;On the Beach&quot;, one of the first major Hollywood films to be made in Australia, was partly filmed in Frankston. The film was adapted from the best-selling novel of the same name, by popular author Nevil Shute (who lived in the City of Frankston suburb of Langwarrin). The name &quot;Falmouth&quot; is used to describe Frankston in the novel, but its actual name is used in the film. Scenes with lead actors Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner were filmed at Frankston railway station and on Young Street in the Frankston CBD, and at Frankston Beach with main supporting actors Fred Astaire (in his first dramatic film role), Anthony Perkins, and Donna Anderson. Famously, when asked to &quot;give us a few steps&quot; by an onlooker at Frankston railway station, the off-duty Fred Astaire danced across the length of the forecourt up to the station ramp.

On 19 October 1960, the eastern riding of the old Shire of Frankston and Hastings was incorporated as the Shire of Hastings, with the central riding becoming the Shire of Frankston. The shire was proclaimed a city on 24 August 1966, and incorporated as the City of Frankston.

The Frankston flotilla of the Volunteer Coast Guard was established in 1961, as one of the eight founding flotillas in Victoria.
In 1969, poet Annie May (Nan) McClelland bequeathed the land known as Studio Park in the City of Frankston suburb of Langwarrin to establish the Harry McClelland Art Gallery and Cultural Hall in honour of her artist brother Harry McClelland. The McClelland siblings were at the centre of a bohemian artists group based in the Frankston locality of Long Island during the 1920s, which included artists and writers such as Sir Daryl and Lady Joan Lindsay, Percy Leason and William Beckwith McInnes. Located at what is now 390 McClelland Drive. on the border of Frankston and Langwarrin, it opened in 1971. During its first 40 years of operation its governor was philanthropist Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. To support the acquisition of new works, the Elisabeth Murdoch Sculpture Foundation was established in 1989. Now named the McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park, it is the leading sculpture park in Australia, and has over 130,000 visitors annually.

In 1986, the Australian film &quot;Frog Dreaming&quot; (which was retitled as &quot;The Go-Kids&quot; in the UK and &quot;The Quest&quot; in the US) was filmed in Frankston and at nearby Moorooduc Quarry in Mount Eliza (which was in the former 1966 City of Frankston borders at the time).

The borders of the City of Frankston were redrawn in 1994, excising its southern suburbs of Baxter and Mount Eliza to the new Shire of Mornington Peninsula, and gaining the north-eastern suburbs of Carrum Downs and Skye from the City of Casey and the former City of Springvale. The proposed name of the new city was initially &quot;City of Nepean&quot;, but the historic name of Frankston (which had been used for its local government areas for over 100 years) was ultimately kept.

Following nearly a decade of campaigning by residents, in 1995, Frankston City Council opened a A$18.5 million arts centre. Originally named the Frankston Cultural Centre, it houses an 800-seat theatre with the second largest proscenium arched stage in Victoria. It also houses the Frankston Library, exhibition spaces, and a 500-seat function hall. Designed by architect Daryl Jackson, and located on the corner of Davey Street and Young Street in the Frankston CBD, it was opened on 20 May by then Prime Minister of Australia the Hon. Paul Keating. A flexible 194-seat theatre named Cube37 with studios and a wet workshop was also built adjoining the northeast corner of the centre in 2001, and was opened on 30 March by then Prime Minister of Australia the Hon. John Howard. Now named the Frankston Arts Centre, it serves over 250,000 patrons annually.

===21st century===

At the turn of the 3rd millennium, Frankston City Council prepared a comprehensive scheme to develop key zones on the Frankston foreshore. The scheme was delivered in stages and included: a new waterfront area with public amenities and a visitor centre; a raised timber foreshoreway and a pedestrian bridge over the mouth of Kananook Creek; and new life saving and yacht club houses—and were primarily constructed over existing sites and car parking areas.

The first stage of the scheme, named the Frankston Waterfront, was undertaken in the mid-2000s, and included: landscaping with public art (around Frankston Pier north to the mouth of Kananook Creek); erection of the pedestrian bridge over the mouth of Kananook Creek (next to the existing Frankston Yacht Club house); construction of the café, restaurant and visitor centre building (next to Frankston Pier); installation of a large playground (between the new visitor centre and existing Frankston Volunteer Coast Guard flotilla); as well as the southern stretch of the foreshoreway, named the Frankston Boardwalk (from Frankston Pier to near the base of Olivers Hill).

The A$1 million Frankston Visitor Information Centre at the Frankston Waterfront opened in 2007. The centre has since won the Victorian Tourism Award and Australian Tourism Award for its &quot;visitor information services&quot; in 2012, 2013 and 2014. It was also inducted into the Victorian and Australian Tourism Hall of Fame in 2014 (after which it is no longer eligible for awards).

In 2007, Sand Sculpting Australia made the Frankston Waterfront the home of its annual sand festival. Held over four months from 26 December, it is the largest exhibition of sand art in Australia and one of the largest in the Southern Hemisphere—with approximately 3,500 tonnes of sand used during the 2014 festival.

The second stage of the foreshore development scheme was undertaken in the late-2000s, and included: construction of the new Frankston Life Saving Club house (north of the Frankston Waterfront), and the northern stretch of the Frankston Boardwalk foreshoreway (between the new Frankston Life Saving Club and existing Frankston Yacht Club houses).

In 2010, scenes for the Hollywood film &quot;Killer Elite&quot; were shot in Frankston. Lead actor Jason Statham spent five days in July filming at a house on Olivers Hill with supporting actors Aden Young and Lachy Hulme. In the film, the house doubles as an Omani mansion overlooking the Arabian Sea.

In 2012, the major water utility provider South East Water announced its intention to consolidate its business operations (700 staff spread across three office locations at the time) in a new A$70 million headquarters in Frankston. The site of the building on Kananook Creek Boulevard (along the eastern bank of Kananook Creek) in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD) cost A$4 million. The eight-storey 11,000 m2 building also includes around 550 m2 of café and retail space, that fronts a pedestrian promenade on Kananook Creek. It opened in 2015 and was designed by architectural firm BVN Donovan Hill.

In 2014, Frankston City Council opened a A$49.7 million health and aquatic recreation centre located on the corner of Cranbourne Road and Olive Grove near the Frankston CBD. Named the Peninsula Aquatic Recreation Centre (Frankston ), it has four swimming pools, including an Olympic-size pool (50 metres); an aquatic playground and two water slides (by WhiteWater West); a gym and a health and wellness centre as well as other related facilities. It was designed by architectural firm William Ross Architects.

The third and final stage of the foreshore development scheme saw the construction of a new A$7.5 million Frankston Yacht Club house, as well as beachfront promenade, and was completed in 2016 at a total cost of A$10.7 million. It was designed by architectural firm Taylor Cullity Lethlean.

==Geography and climate==
The suburb is at the southernmost end of Beaumaris Bay on the eastern coastline of Port Phillip; a 22 km continuous stretch of beaches, broken only by Mordialloc Creek, the Patterson River, and Kananook Creek, beginning at sandstone cliffs in the Melbourne southeastern suburb of Beaumaris and ending at Olivers Hill in Frankston.

The suburb of Frankston covers a large geographic area compared with other Melbourne suburbs. It also envelopes a number of localities (with the postcode 3199), which are not independent suburbs, including: Frankston Central Business District (CBD), Frankston East, Frankston Heights, Karingal, Long Island, Mount Erin and Olivers Hill.

Frankston is bordered to the west by the Port Phillip coastline; to the north by property fronting Overton Road and Skye Road, as well as the Long Island and Peninsula Kingswood country clubs (bordering the City of Frankston suburbs of Frankston North and Seaford); to the east by the Mornington Peninsula Freeway/Peninsula Link (bordering the City of Frankston suburb of Langwarrin) and to the south by property fronting Robinsons Road, Golflinks Road, Towerhill Road, Overport Road, Jasper Terrace and Warringa Road, then continuing down from Olivers Hill toward the coastline (bordering the City of Frankston suburb of Frankston South).

===Geography===
The central and northern areas of Frankston are generally flat at around 10 to 12 metres above sea level (32 to 40 feet). The suburb then rises gradually towards its east, and sharply at Olivers Hill towards its south. The southern uplands of the suburb are at the northern end of an uplift area which is in a Horst-Graben structure that extends down the Mornington Peninsula. Similar plutonic intrusive uplifts occur again on the peninsula at Mount Martha and Arthurs Seat.

Two fault zones run under the southern uplands of Frankston and continue down the Mornington Peninsula. Named the Manyung Fault and the Selwyn Fault, they are mostly inactive. However, some minor earthquakes and tremors have historically been experienced.

Earthquakes with epicentres in or near the suburb of Frankston have occurred in 1932, 1978, 1980, 2009, 2014, and 2022. The most recent, on 17 September 2022, measured 2.4 on the Richter magnitude scale. The largest, on 22 September 2009, measured 3.0 on the Richter scale.

Olivers Hill is the most prominent elevation in Frankston which rises to 55 metres above sea level (180 feet) at its highest point in the suburb. Its origins date to approximately 415 to 360 million years ago. Its base is Mount Eliza Granite dating from the Devonian period, which was covered in lava tuffs in the Paleogene period. During the Miocene epoch in the Neogene period, the Frankston area was entirely flooded by the sea resulting in a mix of Balcombe Clay (at deep levels) and Baxter Sandstone (at shallow levels) covering the basaltic (lava) level. Fluctuating ice ages of the Pleistocene epoch in the current Quaternary period caused sea levels to rise and fall dramatically and for sedimentary rock and sand to be deposited on the surface of the hill. Aeolian processes in the current Holocene epoch, in which Port Phillip has periodically dried up (as recently as 1000 years ago), has caused further sand to be deposited.

With panoramic views across Port Philip, Olivers Hill is home to the most expensive real estate in Frankston. It is considered to have one of the top ten residential views in Melbourne. Property in the locality has sold for between A$3 and A$4 million in 2015, at the same time as the median house price in the suburb of Frankston being A$390,000.

Due to fluvial processes on its levels of clay and sand and with ongoing property development, landslips on Olivers Hill are historically common. The first recorded landslip was in 1854 with at least one occurring again every decade up to the present day. A landslip once occurred in the 1960s during a live radio show hosted by media personality Graham Kennedy from his house on Olivers Hill, where he and his co-host Mike Walsh described how his driveway was &quot;slipping down the slope&quot;, as they spoke on air. The most recent serious landslips occurred in 2007, 2012 and 2015. In all three of the occurrences, the fallen debris has blocked lanes on Nepean Highway.

====Coastline====


The suburb is at the southernmost end of Beaumaris Bay on the eastern coastline of Port Phillip; a 22 km continuous stretch of beaches, broken only by Mordialloc Creek, the Patterson River and Kananook Creek, beginning at sandstone cliffs in the Melbourne southeastern suburb of Beaumaris and ending at Olivers Hill in Frankston.

Frankston Beach is continually rated as one of the cleanest in Australia. It won the Keep Australia Beautiful Victorian Clean Beaches Award in 2008, 2011 and 2012 (the final year of the award), and also represented Victoria for the Australian Clean Beach Award in those years. On days of storm with gale-force westerly winds Frankston becomes one of the few areas of Port Phillip with wave swell of a size that allows for surfing—usually around two metres. As a result, Frankston Beach is one of the most popular among both locals and visitors in Victoria.
Three sand bars are located off the coastline of Frankston Beach. The first bar is located relatively close the shore which creates shallow troughs in a rhythmic fashion every 150 metres. The second is located 100 metres offshore and also alternates rhythmically, although less than the 150-metre fashion of the first. The third is straight and located 200 metres into the bay.

Frankston City Council also has strict protection policies with regards to the sand dunes and native flora along the Frankston foreshore, and has regularly received commendations for its litter prevention and coastal rehabilitation programs. As a result, its coastline has retained much of its natural element. A raised timber foreshoreway named the Frankston Boardwalk winds through large areas of the foreshore (including the Frankston Foreshore Reserve) in order to protect it whilst allowing it to be enjoyed by visitors.

Only key zones on the foreshore at the Frankston Waterfront have been developed. Around Frankston Pier north to the mouth of Kananook Creek is landscaped with public art, and has a café and restaurants, a playground, the Frankston Visitor Information Centre, Frankston Yacht Club, and Frankston Volunteer Coast Guard. North of it is the Frankston Life Saving Club.

Kananook Creek runs close to the coastline of Port Phillip Bay, leaving a narrow strip of coast several kilometres long almost completely surrounded by water, giving the locality the name Long Island. It is not technically an island, as the creek does not flow into the bay at any point other than its mouth near Frankston Beach. However, in 1984 the Patterson Lakes, which connect to the bay, were joined to Kananook Creek via an underground aqueduct, and a pumping station was built to pump salt water from the lakes into the creek to improve the water quality in the creek.

A substantial sand dune, which was formed over 1000 years ago, once ran parallel to the majority of the Frankston coastline and provided the course for the Frankston railway line (between Mordialloc and Seaford) and for the Nepean Highway (to Olivers Hill).

====Environment====

Frankston is generally a leafy suburb with a wide variety of natural heritage elements. There are hundreds of floral species that are indigenous to the Frankston area, including over 20 species of orchid (some of which are also endemic to the area), and can be found in large natural reserves as well as formal public gardens in the suburb.

The Frankston Spider Orchid (&quot;Caladenia robinsonii&quot;) is a rare species of orchid that is endemic to the Frankston area. It produces a 4 cm red and creamy-yellow flower, with five sepals, that exudes a scent which mimics the pheromones of the Thynnid wasp female in order to attract males to pollinate it. It is a threatened species.

Frankston City Council has a variety of programs aiming to better environmental sustainability in the suburb. It won the Bronze Award for its &quot;management of environment, and enhancement of quality of life&quot; at the LivCom International Awards for Livable Communities in 2004. The City of Frankston has also won the Keep Australia Beautiful Victorian Sustainable Cities Award in 2008. It was named the overall Victorian Sustainable City of the Year in 2015.

Large natural parks and reserves in the suburb are: Bunarong Park, Frankston Foreshore Reserve, Lower Sweetwater Creek Reserve, and Paratea Reserve. Large formal public parks and gardens in the suburb are: Ballam Park, Beauty Park, Frankston Waterfront, and George Pentland Botanic Gardens named after former City of Frankston Shire Secretary and Town Clerk George Pentland.

====Landmarks====
Ballam Park estate, located on Cranbourne Road in the Frankston locality of Karingal, is home to the first brick house in the Frankston area. The house was built in 1855 for Frank Liardet, by his younger brother Frederick, and was designed in a French Colonial Gothic Revival style by their father Wilbraham. It is listed on the Victorian and Australian heritage registries through the National Trust of Australia. It is managed by the Frankston Historical Society which conducts tours of the house and also maintains a local history museum at the estate.

The 500-metre Frankston Pier is a local landmark of the suburb. Originally built in 1857, it has been both extended as well as repaired a number of times over the years. Near Frankston Pier is the arched pedestrian bridge over the mouth Kananook Creek, erected in 2003 as part of the Frankston Waterfront development, which is also lit in a variety of colours at night.

Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute, located at 1 Plowman Place in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD), which was established in 1880, is the oldest public building in the suburb. It was expanded in 1915 with an addition to its street frontage, which is now the oldest extant part of the building. According to the Victorian Heritage Database, it was once the site of the first permanent building in the Frankston area, a pub named the Cannanuke Inn, built in the mid-1840s. The use of the site as a meeting place also pre-dates European settlement of Frankston, and was used by the Indigenous Australian clans of the Bunurong tribe on the Mornington Peninsula for corroborees and as a trading place.

McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park is a major public art gallery in Frankston and on the Mornington Peninsula. Established in 1971, and located at 390 McClelland Drive on the border of Frankston and the City of Frankston suburb of Langwarrin, it is also the leading sculpture park in Australia. It has over 130,000 visitors annually.

The 12-storey Peninsula on the Bay, located at 435 Nepean Highway in the Frankston CBD, is the tallest building in Frankston and on the Mornington Peninsula. Built in 1973 as a shopping centre and offices complex named the Peninsula Centre and designed in a brutalist style, it was once called &quot;the worst building in Australia&quot; by comedian Barry Humphries. It remained mostly vacant during the 2000s, until it was redeveloped as a luxury serviced apartments and offices complex by Asian Pacific Group in 2013.

Frankston Arts Centre is the largest art centre in Frankston and on the Mornington Peninsula, as well as one of the largest in the metropolitan area of Melbourne, and is a major landmark of the suburb. Built in 1995 on the corner of Davey Street and Young Street in the Frankston CBD, it was designed by architect Daryl Jackson. It serves over 250,000 patrons annually.

===Climate===

Frankston has a temperate oceanic climate, the same as the rest of the metropolitan area of Melbourne; however, the suburb is usually around 2 °C cooler than the Melbourne city centre.

===Housing===
A dominant suburban element in the Frankston area means its residential property mix is not as diverse as areas that are closer to the Melbourne city centre—as the suburb has minimal multi-storey development. However, as the economic hub as well as gateway to the Mornington Peninsula, Frankston has been defined as one of the nine activity centres in the metropolitan area of Melbourne in various Victorian state government planning policies—which aim to increase multi-storey property development in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD).

According to the 2021 Australian census, 25.7% of Frankston residents own their property; 32.6% are purchasing their property with a mortgage; and 39.1% are renting their property. 73.4% of occupied private dwellings were separate houses; 6.1% were apartments, flats or units; and 20.3% were semi-detached houses.

Frankston consists mostly of traditional quarter-acre blocks colloquially referred to as the &quot;Australian Dream&quot;, and 40% of houses in the suburb consist of three or more bedrooms. A concentration of apartments, flats and units are also centred around the Frankston CBD. Being one of the southernmost suburbs of the metropolitan area of Melbourne, Frankston is also one of its most affordable. As of the March quarter of 2015, the median house price in the suburb is $390,000. Comparatively the median house price of the metropolitan area of Melbourne overall is $638,445, and the median house price of Australia generally is A$576,100.

Some real estate in Frankston, however, routinely sells for well above the median house price for the suburb. For example, properties in the catchment area of Frankston High School, which is one of the most reputable state government schools in Victoria, sell on average for 16.9% more than the median house price. The locality of Olivers Hill, with its panoramic views across Port Philip, is home to the most expensive real estate in Frankston. Property in the area has sold for between A$3 and A$4 million in 2015, at the same time as the median house price in the suburb of Frankston being A$390,000. Olivers Hill is considered to have one of the top ten residential views in Melbourne.

==Governance==
The City of Frankston local government area is divided into nine wards, with each of the wards represented by one councillor, which are: Ballam Ward, Centenary Park Ward, Derinya Ward, Elisabeth Murdoch Ward, Kananook Ward, Lyrebird Ward, Pines Ward, Wilton Ward, and Yamala Ward. Mayor Kris Bolam JP leads the city council, with Cr Steffie Conroy as the Deputy Mayor. 

Frankston is located in the South Eastern Metropolitan Region for the Victorian Legislative Council. The region is represented by five members; two from the Victorian Labor Party, one from the Victorian Liberal Party, one from the Libertarian Party, and one from the Legalise Cannabis Party. The District of Frankston is the state government district for the Victorian Legislative Assembly that Frankston is located in. The seat has been held by the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party since 2014, and the sitting member of parliament is firefighter and former teacher Paul Edbrooke.

At the federal level, Frankston is part of the Dunkley electorate. The seat has been held by the Australian Labor Party since 2019. Following the 2024 Dunkley by-election, the sitting member of parliament for Dunkley is Jodie Belyea.

The state and federal electorates that Frankston is located in are often referred to as part of the &quot;Melbourne Sandbelt&quot; in the media. The term was coined to describe an area from the Melbourne inner-southeastern suburb of Sandringham south to Frankston that has a large amount of golf courses, but is also used to describe the electorates of the area during state and federal government elections.

==Economy==
Frankston&#x27;s main economic activities are in the health care, retail, hospitality, and education industries. Two hospitals, numerous health care providers, two regional shopping centres, a hard goods retail park, a university campus, a large TAFE institute as well as various secondary and primary schools are all located within the suburb and are a significant source of employment.

According to the 2011 Australian census, 7.6% of Frankston residents are employed in the health care industry (hospital/residential care services)—making it the largest industry of employment for the suburb. It is followed by 6.8% of residents that are employed in the retail/hospitality industry and 4% in the schools/education industry.

Gross regional product (GRP) of the broader City of Frankston area was A$4.7 billion in 2014. A$251.9 million of GRP was also generated directly from tourism in the Frankston area in 2010, and is a contributor to the A$2.2 billion tourism industry of the greater Mornington Peninsula region. Frankston became a popular seaside destination of Melbourne in the 1880s. And, since the early-2000s, tourism is being reestablished as a key industry in the area. Frankston City Council prepared its first tourism strategy for the area in 2003, which continues to have a focus on its beach and waterfront, cultural and natural heritage, major events and festivals, performing and visual arts, as well as restaurants and shopping—with the majority of which being located within the suburb of Frankston.

Currently the suburb of Frankston is defined by the Victorian state Metropolitan Planning Authority as one of nine activity centres in the metropolitan area of Melbourne. It is also under consideration to be redefined as a &quot;national employment cluster&quot; for its industry strengths in health care and education, as well as for being both an economic hub and a tourism destination within the greater Mornington Peninsula region.

The hotels and pubs on its northwest, northeast and southwest corners, have been operating continuously from this time. Around 100 years later, in the mid-1990s, they were joined by a nightclub on its southeast corner.

The first pub in the Frankston area, the Cannanuke Inn, was located near the southeast corner of the intersection (on the present site of the Frankston Mechanics&#x27; Institute at 1 Plowman Place). It was built by pre-emptive Frankston settler James Davey in the mid-1840s. The first hotel on a corner of the intersection, the Frankston Hotel, located on its northwest corner, was licensed on 12 December 1854. The second, the Bay View Hotel, located on its northeast corner, was licensed on 15 November 1873. It was built by James Davey&#x27;s grandson William Davey Jr. The third, the Prince of Wales Hotel, located on its southwest corner, was licensed on 8 December 1884. They have all been remodelled or demolished and rebuilt over the years.

Its southeast corner has had a chequered history. It was the site of Frankston&#x27;s Commonwealth Post Office which was built in 1910, and later remodelled with a telephone exchange in 1927 and expanded again in 1941. It ceased operation as a post office and telephone exchange in the 1980s, after which it was remodelled as Chinese restaurant and later as a Captain America theme restaurant. It was remodelled again as a nightclub named The Saloon during the mid-1990s, and Monkey Bar during the 2000s, and even became a strip club briefly, before being remodelled as an upmarket pub named The Deck Bar in 2013.

Southern Way, the operator of the PeninsulaLink freeway, has a partnership with McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park to place sculptures at the intersection of Cranbourne Road. The sculptures are replaced every two years with the previous being transferred to McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park until 2037. The first was a wind-activated kinetic sculpture named the &quot;Tree of Life&quot; by artist Phil Price, which was installed in 2012 and immediately became popular with residents and motorists. It was replaced in 2015 with a controversial 9-metre chrome-coloured sculpture of a garden gnome named &quot;Reflective Lullaby&quot; by artist Gregor Kregar.

==Health==
The suburb of Frankston is at the centre of a large health care industry within the broader City of Frankston area—which is a health care hub for the greater Mornington Peninsula region. Health care is also the largest industry of employment for the suburb, with 7.6% of Frankston residents being employed in the hospital/residential care services sector. Four hospitals providing secondary, tertiary and specialist care are located in the suburb supported by numerous primary care providers in the surrounding area.

According to Australian government data collected from the former Medicare Local system; between 2011 and 2012, 84% of residents in the combined City of Frankston and Shire of Mornington Peninsula catchment area rated their health as being either &quot;good&quot; or higher. This is close to the average of 85% in Australia, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Better Life Index, which is correlated from the Medicare Local system data.

Advancements in health care have taken place in Frankston and have been led by Frankston people for over a hundred years. First during World War I, when a military hospital was established in the City of Frankston suburb of Langwarrin in order to treat Australian soldiers returning with venereal disease from Egypt and France. Between 1915 and 1916, research at the hospital led to reducing the length of venereal disease and halving the cost of its treatment. It also advanced the burgeoning field of occupational therapy in Australia, during this time.

In the second half of the 20th century; the Frankston virologist Ruth Bishop lead the research team that discovered the rotavirus in 1973, and the Frankston microsurgeon Graeme Miller lead the surgical team that performed the world&#x27;s first successful scalp replantation in 1976. At the turn of the 21st century, research into botulinum toxin injection therapy for paralysis at Frankston Rehabilitation Hospital by the rehabilitation specialist Nathan Johns resulted in a stroke victim standing and walking again in 2009 after being paralysed for 20 years.

Established at the turn of the 20th century, it was initially named Frankston Technical School, (no it wasn&#x27;t, was originally Frankston High School 12th Feb 1924) and was one of the first in Victoria. It later became the Frankston College of TAFE in 1974, before merging with a number of other colleges of TAFE in the southeast metropolitan area of Melbourne to form the Chisholm Institute in 1998. The institute takes its name from the former Chisholm Institute of Technology, which had a campus in Frankston before merging with Monash University in 1990, and had taken its name from the 19th century humanitarian Caroline Chisholm. It is located on Fletcher Road in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD).

The fifth largest campus of Monash University is located in the suburb, on McMahons Road in Frankston, and was established in 1990.

An Arts and Crafts style country house built on the property dates from 1924, and now serves as the postgraduate students&#x27; centre of the campus.

==Transport==

Being one of the southernmost suburbs of the metropolitan area of Melbourne, as well as the gateway to the Mornington Peninsula, Frankston is extensively serviced by both railway and roadway. In particular, the Frankston railway line (named so because Frankston railway station is the last metropolitan station on the line) connects the suburb directly with the Melbourne city centre. The regional Stony Point railway line then runs from Frankston and connects it with the eastern suburbs and towns of the Shire of Mornington Peninsula.

A public transport terminus, with Frankston railway station at its centre, is located on Young Street in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD). From the terminus, local bus services run throughout the suburbs of the broader City of Frankston area, and connect it with the suburbs of the neighbouring cities of Casey, Dandenong and Kingston. Regional bus services also run from the terminus, and connect the suburb with the western suburbs and towns of the Shire of Mornington Peninsula. All rail lines and bus services use the Myki ticketing system, and the suburb is located in Zone 2 of the Melbourne public transport network.

By road, the A$2.5 billion EastLink tollway, which opened in 2008, connects the suburbs of the City of Frankston directly with the suburbs of the neighbouring City of Dandenong, as well as the cities of Maroondah and Whitehorse. The A$759 million PeninsulaLink freeway, which opened in 2013, connects with EastLink at the City of Frankston suburb of Seaford in the north and ends at the Shire of Mornington Peninsula town of Mount Martha in the south. The freeway also includes a 50 km shared use path, which connects with the EastLink path at the neighbouring City of Kingston suburb of Patterson Lakes in the north, and ends at the Shire of Mornington Peninsula town of Moorooduc in the south.

<text>() are light tie-on sandals, made from ropemaking fibers (usually straw), that were the standard footwear of the common people in Japan.
==Use==
 resemble other forms of traditional Japanese footwear, such as zori and geta, with a few key differences. They were historically the simplest form of outdoor footwear (sandals of any type were not worn indoors). , due to their cheap and rustic nature, are considered to be a very informal type of footwear, and are not worn with formal kimono. They are typically worn with socks, and are woven so that the wearer&#x27;s toes generally protrude slightly over the edge of the shoe.

 were once common footwear in Japan. There are records of in the Heian period (794–1185 CE), with the possibility of having existed before this time. In the Edo period (1603–1867 CE), geta were worn in cities, but anyone making a long journey wore . They were also worn for energetic or prolonged labour. Their light weight and grip were valued.

In modern-day Japan, are worn by Buddhist monks, and by some fishers of mountain streams. Zori and geta are worn far more commonly by the general population.

==Construction==
In constant use, rice-straw only last three or four days, or roughly 24 hours of active use and so people would have to make about a hundred pairs a year, on average, if they wore them constantly. As could be homemade from cheap materials, and many people learned how to make them in childhood, that was not a problem. could also be cheaply bought. Travellers carried a supply and discarded them when they were worn out.

==Materials==
Rice straw is the common and traditional material for weaving . Long straw (not broken by the processing methods) must be beaten to soften the fibers before use. Most other ropemaking fibers can also be used, such as cotton, hemp, palm fibers, or even strips of rag. The straps of the might be covered, often with paper. Cardboard soles are used on some modern commercial designs.

===Tying===
There are a number of different ways of tying straps; even historically, there was no standardised method of attaching the shoes to one&#x27;s feet.

==Ceremonial use==
Traditionally, were donated to temples as offerings for healthy feet and protection on journeys. This practice, while now less common, is still followed. More modernly, giant () kept in temples are touched as a charm for tireless endurance in walking.

<text>Frankston North (originally the Pines Forest Estate, also known as &quot;The Pines&quot;) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 38 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Frankston local government area. Frankston North recorded a population of 5,711 at the 2021 census.

==The Pines==

Frankston North was originally named Pines Forest because the area was a government pine plantation before becoming a government housing estate and the area still carries that name. The area became known as&quot;The Pines&quot;as an abbreviation of the name of the suburb and is still known by that name today. The Ministry of Housing established the &quot;Pines Forest Estate&quot; in the 1950s which made up the bulk of the suburb. In order to pay homage to the name, Pines have been planted across the suburb during 2016/2017.

Houses are a mixture of low scale dwellings set in gardens. The street-scape is generally open due to the low horizontal building forms and low or open style fencing. The homes were predominantly constructed in the 1960s-1970s by the Housing Commission of Victoria. Most homes were constructed as single story, brick veneer with cement tiled roofs. Some homes were constructed from conite, predominantly in the western, older sections of the precinct. Sealed roads have kerbs and footpaths on both sides of the street. Trees are mainly native Australian trees, such as Eucalyptus, medium to large in size and planted irregularly in streets. The approximate size of Frankston North is 5.2 km2.

==Population and housing==

2011 Census of Population and Housing data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics states that 5,626 persons lived in Frankston North as at 2011. Of these, some 4,594 were aged 15 years or over and 3,945 were born in Australia.

*Median age: 39
*Median monthly housing loan repayment: $1,180 
*Median weekly rent: $225
*Median weekly individual income: $382
*Median weekly family income: $889
*Median weekly household income: $760
*Average household size: 2.4

==Frankston North Community Centre==

In 1983, the City of Frankston purchased a former Ministry of Housing rent office at 2 Candlebark Crescent Pines Forest. This served as the community centre for some years before a new building was established in Mahogany Avenue Pines Forest and was later named the Mahogany Neighbourhood Centre before more recently becoming The Frankston North Community Centre. The Candlebark site became an office for a local not for profit legal centre and has since been demolished along with the neighbouring early childhood centre.

==Former Monterey High School site==
In 1993, the decision was taken to merge Monterey High School and Monterey Technical School to reduce the administrative costs of running two schools. Monterey Secondary College was formed and was based at the previous Technical school site on Silvertop Street. The High school campus was deconstructed, in preparation for development of the site situated on the corner of Monterey Boulevard and Forest Drive.

The ex-high school site was earmarked for several public works projects including its use as public land - as either park space or sports reserve. None eventuated, and instead, the site was sold to a developer by the Kennett Liberal government while it lay dormant and decomposed. The Bracks Labor Government later compulsorily re-purchased the land and offered it for free to the City of Frankston. Asbestos was found at the site during the early 1990s when residents embarked on a community cleanup program until a committee of management was established by the council. An asbestos removal program, to commence in 1996, never materialised.

A petition, signed by 1,879 residents of Carrum Downs and presented to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1997 further sought action to begin &quot;construction of suitable facilities in Carrum Downs with the view of relocating Monterey Secondary College from its present location in Frankston North&quot;. The action, intended to secure educational facilities in Carrum Downs, an adjoining suburb, was unsuccessful.

A Public Sector Investment Program estimated the site to be worth $1m during 2000–01. The money to purchase the site was to be sourced from the sale of proceeds from surplus properties by the Department of Treasury and Finance but again never eventuated.

As of 2006 this former site, now known as Monterey Community Park had a skate park and playground added with a toilet block and walking/cycle track also now in place. There are current plans for a village green type area to be built including a shaded performance area and further pathways. These works are reported to be completed by February 2010 and will be utilised at that time for Pines Pride Day, an annual event now held on the site.

==Monterey Secondary College==
Monterey Secondary College was formed by the merger of Monterey High School and Monterey Technical School during the early 1990s. The merger was conducted to reduce the administrative and running costs for both schools.

The High school that was on the corner of Monterey Boulevard and Forest Drive was closed, and the two were amalgamated on the site of the Technical school in Silvertop Avenue. The former High School site is now Monterey Community Park.

The school is known for its successful participation in the Victorian Rock Eisteddfod Challenge, winning first prize during 1995 with their performance based on a &quot;Batman&quot; theme. The school is also known for its sporting achievements.

==History==
===Reserve created for preservation and growth of timber===
In 1853, a &#x27;run&#x27; of land, named &quot;Balleymarong&quot; edit was established and later acquired by Sir Andrew Clarke, surveyor general to the Colony of Victoria from 1853. Balleymarong&#x27;s northern boundary was Eumemmering Creek (now the Patterson River). The southern boundary was Skye Road. Boundary Road (now McClelland Drive) was the eastern boundary with the western side boundary being Port Phillip Bay.

The 1860 Victorian Land Act led to the sub-division and sale of land in Balleymarong. The Victorian Government reserved for various purposes. was set aside &#x27;For the Preservation and Growth of Timber&#x27;.

Circa 1870, the inbound &#x27;Clarke Reserve&#x27; was proposed as an alternative site for the Old Melbourne Cemetery. It was later agreed that an area at Springvale was a better site. The &#x27;Clarke Reserve&#x27; was established in 1909 as a State Pine forest called the Frankston Pine Plantation. W.J. Hartland was appointed as Conservator in Charge. Pinus radiata was the most successful of the various species planted. A count taken of numbers revealed that over 1 million trees had been planted.

James Brown was appointed as the second forest officer to the State Pine Plantation in the 1920s. A residence was built in Dandenong Road for him and his daughter by the Victorian Forest Commission. This house still exists. The last officer in charge of the State Pine Plantation was Harry Firth who lasted until 1956.

===Fire in the Pines Plantation===
During 1955, a fire destroyed a large part of the plantation. Another fire would threaten the housing estate later in the century during 1999. In 1956, were excised from the reserved area to allow the Housing Commission to build houses for low-income families.

The first stage of the housing in Pines Forest was completed in 1957 and Pines Forest Post Office opened on 12 October 1959 (closing in 1980). The Pines Forest Post Office is now run as a private business in the Pines Forest shopping strip on the corner of Forest Drive and Mahogany boulevard.

The first streets constructed were in the south of the area. The names of the streets alluded to the species of pines planted in the plantation: The first street constructed was Pine Street, followed by Plantation Street and Forest Drive. The various pine species reflected in street names are Monterey, Radiata, Corsican, Aleppo, Norfolk, and Excelsior (Excelsa). Many other streets in Frankston North are named after exotic and native species. Several species of flowering eucalyptus were planted in the street verges. Excelsior Drive was the northern boundary.

In 1965, the second wave and eventual completion of the building program began east of Excelsior Drive and extended as far as the proposed Mornington Peninsula Freeway to the east. The freeway zone acted as a buffer between the houses and the Frankston Municipal tip.

===1970s and 1980s===
&quot;The Pines&quot; had a reputation during the 1970s and 1980s for being a &quot;high crime&quot; suburb. Leader Community Newspapers records show that car theft, assaults, vandalism and drug related crime were commonplace. There was continual rivalry and fighting between pupils of Monterey Technical and High schools. It was commonplace to witness on-field violence at home games of the &#x27;Pines Football Club&#x27;.

East Ward councilor Jane Hill said that there was &quot;No reason for (the) Pines stigma&quot; and said that its reputation existed only in the minds of a minority of Frankston residents.

Community action during 1980 prevented a proposal to subdivide the Pines Flora and Fauna Reserve. Unions supported the stance against the plan which was developed in the 1970s

===Changes in The Pines&#x27; reputation===
Monterey Boulevard, a major thoroughfare which travels from west to east through the centre of the suburb used to be a well-known illegal street drag racing location until traffic chicanes were installed in 1993. There are now speed humps and roundabouts throughout the estate and a local Hoon hotline has been established.

During the 1990s, many state-owned homes were sold to the inhabitants as private homes, particularly within the eastern quarter. This led to better maintenance and presentation as homeowners renovated.

==Pines Flora and Fauna Reserve==

The Pines Flora and Fauna Reserve is a 108 hectare reserve which contains a significant remnant of bushland from the Mornington Peninsula. Access is via walking tracks on Tamarisk Drive, Excelsior Drive and Warrawee Circuit.

The reserve is considered ideal for recreation activities such as nature study, photography and walking. Trig Point contains expansive views of the reserve, Port Phillip Bay and the Dandenong Ranges. A network of tracks allows visitors to walk to most features of the reserve.

Very little is known of Aboriginal activity in the area other than the use of the springs as a source of fresh water by the Bunurong people. A proposal in the 1970s to sandmine the remaining bushland met with community uproar and the Eureka Flag was raised on Trig Point (the site from which the Frankston area was originally surveyed) and the area claimed for the people of Frankston.

The reserve is a very important habitat for native fauna, particularly small mammals, reptiles and amphibians. Southern brown bandicoots, swamp wallabies, echidnas, and brushtail and ringtail possums are present but are often hard to find as they are not all active during the day. The reserve is also a potential habitat for the endangered New Holland mouse.

Over 100 bird species have been recorded including honeyeaters, waterbirds, birds of prey and parrots. A number of significant species have been recorded including the painted button quail, brush bronzewing, Latham&#x27;s snipe and swift parrot.

Much of the vegetation of the reserve is remnant heathland with silver-leaf stringybark and black sheoak. It is still in a reasonable natural condition and contains many species of plants now rare on the Mornington Peninsula. Native orchids are a highlight of the many wildflowers that mainly bloom in spring. Rabbit ears orchid, dwarf greenhood orchid and the not so common common spider orchid (&quot;Dendrobium tetragonum&quot;) are some of the orchids to be found among the 170 or more plant species recorded.

In January 2018, the Carrum Downs Bushfire broke out in the Carrum Downs side of the reserve.

==Frankston Pines Football Club==

Frankston Pines (Association) Football Club, known as The Pines, are a local association football club based at Monterey Reserve. Formed in 1965 by Scottish Australians, the club has failed to reach the Victorian Premier League since being relegated in 2008. Since then, the club plummeted down to the provisional leagues, below the State League Division 3. The club was in huge trouble with a big financial debt on its back and was close to winding up. However, the club was promoted in 2012 and thereafter achieved two more successive promotions by 2014.

==Pines Australian Rules Football Club==
Pines Australian Rules Football club, known as The Pythons, are a renowned local football team with their homeground based at Eric Bell Reserve, more commonly known to locals and rival teams as the &quot;Snakepit&quot;.

The strength of the club&#x27;s ties can be traced to its origins. The club was formed in 1964, not long after the establishment of a housing commission estate in Pines Forest/Frankston North. The club experienced several lean years in which it struggled to win a game before local juniors began graduating into the senior team. In fact in its early years it was the junior sides that helped establish the club&#x27;s success. In 1967, the club&#x27;s under 12 team was the first side to represent the Pines Football club in a grand final. As young players graduated through its ranks the football club began winning premierships in all competition levels including 3 consecutive flags between 1968 and 1970 via its under-15 side.

On the estate of some 2000 houses, with several players in most of them, the football club improved when local teenagers began making their mark. Barry Burke, the father of St Kilda midfielder Nathan Burke, moulded the team into a premiership unit.

Pines football club also produced several VFL/AFL players, most notably Russell Greene (Hawthorn &amp; St Kilda), Brendon Moore, Steve Newman and Kevin Taylor.

==Pines Forest Swimming Centre==

Frankston North is home to a 50-metre heated outdoor six-lane swimming pool. The Swimming Centre contains a giant waterslide and slide pool, which is visible from adjoining Forest Drive. The centre also contains a Toddlers pool, barbecue facilities and half-court basketball area. Operated by Frankston City Council, the centre is used by schools from surrounding suburbs for sports and recreational activities.

==Rotary Club of Frankston North==

Due to the population of the City of Frankston increasing rapidly in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, a local chapter of the club was established for Frankston North. The inaugural meeting (or interest meeting) of the new Club was held on 14 March 1973 at the Sundowner hotel, Seaford. It was attended by 27 people and was chaired by Past District Governor, John Emerton. Others present were District Governor George Allsop, Bruce Hall - President of the sponsoring Club, Frankston, the District Governor&#x27;s special representative Norm Arthur (Past President of the Frankston Club), and a number of interested Rotarians from the Frankston Club.

The meeting unanimously resolved that a new Club should be formed and that it should be known as the Rotary Club of Frankston North. In accordance with Rotary requirements, territorial limits were set, and these limits, as described in the &#x27;Intention to Cede&#x27; papers proposed by the Rotary Club of Frankston, were accepted by the new Club.

The election of office bearers then took place and the following officers were appointed: Lloyd Worland as charter president, Bob Dawson as charter vice-president, Lloyd Beard as charter secretary, and Max Batey as charter treasurer.

==The Pines Cultural Mapping Project==

During 2003 an extensive Cultural Mapping exercise was developed in collaboration with the community of North Frankston. The exercise focused on the implementation of six significant community art projects.

The project is funded by the Victorian government&#x27;s Department of Human Services and the City of Frankston. Support was also provided by the Mahogany Neighbourhood Centre, Monterey Secondary College and local service providers and businesses.

The project included the development of art designations for The Pines Gateways, such as banners and markers and mosaic pavers for the Pines Parks entrances and exits.

*Is more disadvantaged by a range of measures including unemployment, resident income and level of education
*Has more homes that are being purchased or rented from the government, and fewer that are owned
*Has more Indigenous but fewer non-English-speaking residents including from the Philippines and Germany.

In terms of community engagement, compared to Victoria as a whole, Frankston North
*Has lower levels of participation in activities like organised groups and organised sport
*Has a similar percentage of residents that feel it is an active community and more residents who think that there is easy access to parks, bike tracks and recreational areas.

A consumer credit report by Dun &amp; Bradstreet published in 2009 showed that, of all Australian suburbs, Frankston North has citizens most at risk of defaulting on bills and loans.

==Public facilities and transport==

<text>Langwarrin ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Frankston local government area. Langwarrin recorded a population of 23,588 at the .

Langwarrin is bounded in the north mostly by Valley Road, in the east by Dandenong-Hastings Road, in the south by Robinsons Road and in the west by the Mornington Peninsula Freeway and by McClelland Drive to the northwest.

==History==

In 1843, Langwarrin was coined after the Lang Warring pastoral run which ran from the current Langwarrin to the Western Port Coastal Reserve in Tyabb. By the 1880s the entire pastoral run was reduced to the Langwarrin Estate of about 7000 acres. Subsequently a military reserve named the Langwarrin Military Reserve was built on the area&#x27;s western edges, being famous for holding prisoners of war in World War I and acting as a military hospital for soldiers with venereal disease. The true purpose of the reserve however, was to defend against an amphibious invasion from the Western Port.

The Stony Point railway was formed in 1889 which went through Langwarrin, reaching all the way to Stony Point and branched to Mornington via Baxter. The station was opposite to the military reserve. Subsequently, Langwarrin opened three post offices. 

Langwarrin Primary School, a state school, opened in 1890. In 1928 Cruden Farm was established as a gift to Elizabeth Murdoch, the bride to Keith Murdoch, being a Herald Sun executive. A shopping centre would be built around this time west of Warrandyte Road.

Langwarrin&#x27;s housing spread from the western edges near the now Karingal Hub Shopping Centre, and moved east from the 1960s onwards. The Langwarrin Military Reserve was closed in 1980 and given to the State Government, now the Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve, establishing itself in 1985. In the same year The Gateway Shopping Centre would be built.

==Geography==

It has access to the Melbourne CBD via the Western Port Highway, South Gippsland Highway and loosely the Monash Freeway. The Cranbourne-Frankston Road which runs northeast-southwest through Langwarrin is a two-lane-each-direction carriageway.

Until December 1994 Langwarrin was part of the City of Cranbourne (formerly the Shire of Cranbourne until April of the same year). Subsequently the suburb was moved into City of Frankston as part of statewide reform of local government.

use include earthworks, drainage and foundations and changes in the pattern of vegetation following regrowth after clearing.

==Recreation &amp; Economy==

===Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve===
Langwarrin&#x27;s most prominent landscape feature is its large Flora and Fauna reserve (formerly the Langwarrin Military Reserve). The nature reserve has many walking tracks and is an ideal place for quiet recreation activities such as walking, nature study and photography.

The Langwarrin Military Reserve was established in 1886 at what was then deemed to be a strategic elevated location for the defence of Port Phillip Bay and Melbourne from seaborne attack. Over time it was extended to its present size of .

Prior to World War I, the reserve was used mainly for temporary encampments of volunteer soldiery from throughout Victoria held at Easter or after New Year. These were held here in
1888, 1891, 1894, 1896, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1904 and 1910 as evidenced by the dates the Langwarrin Camp Post Office was open. The Langwarrin railway station was opened in 1888 next to the facility; in the same year a failed attempt was made to sell allotments on a new township of Aldershot adjoining the reserve. On the outbreak of World War 1 the reserve was used for the detention of enemy aliens (predominantly Germans) and from 1915 a military hospital for combatants with venereal disease was established.

After World War II, the reserve was used occasionally for military training, until 1974 when it came under control of the Balcombe Military Camp and was used for training of Army Reserve and school cadet units etc.. In 1980 the reserve was leased to the Victorian Ministry of Conservation and in 1982 the State Government purchased the reserve from the Commonwealth Government.

Today, all the buildings are gone. Remaining evidence of past use include earthworks, drainage and foundations and changes in the pattern of vegetation following regrowth after clearing.

=== McClelland Gallery ===
The McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park is a prominent gallery, set in eight hectares of landscaped bushland, featuring a sculpture park. It was named in honour of renowned Frankston artists, Nan McClelland and Harry McClelland. The McClelland Award is Australia&#x27;s richest sculpture prize, and is awarded by the gallery biennially (supported by the gallery&#x27;s patron and Langwarrin resident, the late Dame Elisabeth Murdoch).

<doc id="611306" wikidata="Q3052674" url="?curid=611306" title="Supreme Governor of the Church of England">
<text>The Supreme Governor of the Church of England is the titular head of the Church of England, a position which is vested in the British monarch. Although the monarch&#x27;s authority over the Church of England is largely ceremonial and is mostly observed in a symbolic capacity, the position is still relevant to the established church. As the supreme governor, the monarch formally appoints high-ranking members of the church on the advice of the prime minister of the United Kingdom, who in turn acts on the advice of the Crown Nominations Commission. Since the Act of Settlement of 1701, all Supreme Governors have been members of the Church of England.

== History ==
By 1536, King Henry VIII had broken with the Holy See, seized assets of the Catholic Church in England and Wales and declared the Church of England as the established church with himself as its supreme head. The Act of Supremacy 1534 confirmed the king&#x27;s status as having supremacy over the church and required the peers to swear an oath recognising Henry&#x27;s supremacy. Henry&#x27;s daughter Mary I attempted to restore the English Church&#x27;s allegiance to the Pope and repealed the Act of Supremacy in 1555. Elizabeth I ascended to the throne in 1558, and the Parliament restored the original Act by passing the Act of Supremacy 1558. To placate critics, the Oath of Supremacy, which peers were required to swear, set the monarch&#x27;s title as &quot;supreme governor&quot; rather than &quot;supreme head&quot; of the restored Church of England. This wording avoided the charge that the monarchy was claiming divinity or subordinating Jesus of Nazareth (whom the Christian Bible explicitly identified as the head of the Church in the Epistle to the Ephesians).

&quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; (&quot;Fidei Defensor&quot;) has been part of the English—and since the union of Scotland and England, the British—monarch&#x27;s title since Henry VIII was granted it by Pope Leo X in 1521 in recognition of Henry&#x27;s role in opposing the Protestant Reformation. The pope withdrew the title, but it was later reconferred by Parliament in the reign of Edward VI.

===Thirty-Nine Articles===
The monarch&#x27;s role is acknowledged in the preface to the Thirty-Nine Articles of 1562. It states that:

Article 37 makes this claim to royal supremacy more explicit:

== Church of Scotland ==
The British monarch vows to uphold the constitution of the Church of Scotland (a Presbyterian national church), but does not hold a leadership position in it. Nevertheless, the monarch appoints the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland as their personal representative, with a ceremonial role. Queen Elizabeth II on occasion filled the role personally, as when she opened the General Assembly in 1977 and 2002 (her Silver and Golden Jubilee years).

<doc id="611308" wikidata="Q4992331" url="?curid=611308" title="Ibrahim of Johor">
<text>Sultan Sir Ibrahim Al-Masyhur ibni Almarhum Sultan Abu Bakar Al-Khalil Ibrahim Shah (Jawi: ; 17 September 1873 – 8 May 1959) was a Malaysian sultan and the 2nd modern Sultan of Johor and 22nd Sultan of Johor overall. He was considered &quot;fabulously wealthy.&quot; 

An Anglophile, Sultan Ibrahim continued the policy of friendly relations with the crown of the United Kingdom, often manipulating his friendship with the reigning kings of Britain to thwart the expansionist ambitions of the British Colonial Office. However, he became highly unpopular later in his native land for his opposition to Malayan independence. This led him to spend most of his time away from Johor, traveling extensively in Europe, particularly to Britain.

==Early life==

Wan Ibrahim was born 17 September 1873 in the Istana Bidadari, Singapore, and received his education at a boarding school in England during his formative years. He was appointed a second lieutenant of the Johor Military Forces (JMF) during his teenage years and was formally installed as the first Tunku Mahkota of Johor on 23 May 1891 and was brought to Europe by his father where he was introduced to the European royal families. During his term as the Tunku Mahkota, Tunku Ibrahim occasionally acted as the state&#x27;s regent and was delegated a few state duties whenever the Sultan was travelling overseas. In his free time, Tunku Ibrahim spent most of his time in hunting and horseracing.

Tunku Ibrahim acted as one of the three signatories when Sultan Abu Bakar promogulated the Johor State Constitution in April 1895. The following month, Tunku Ibrahim accompanied Abu Bakar to London, who had the intent of seeking further negotiations with the Colonial Office on state affairs. Abu Bakar was by then very ill when he reached England, and Tunku Ibrahim spent much of his time by his father&#x27;s bedside before Abu Bakar died the following month.

==Sultan of Johor==

===Early years (1895–1914)===
Tunku Ibrahim was proclaimed as the Sultan of Johor on the day of Abu Bakar&#x27;s burial on 7 September 1895, while his one-year-old son, Tunku Ismail was proclaimed as his heir-apparent. A formal coronation ceremony took place on 2 November 1895. He took over the state government the following year, and one of his first reports was the financial difficulties which the state was facing. Many of his employees complained of delays in receiving their salaries; which were often paid in instalments. Sultan Ibrahim then took charge of closely supervising the state treasury, and personally witnessed the payment of the state&#x27;s employees during payment day. In the same year, he also took on the task of appointing the committee members of the Johor Gambier and Pepper Society (also known as &quot;Kongkek&quot; in Malay). Sultan Ibrahim was inexperienced in public administration skills and heavily relied on his private secretary, Dato Amar DiRaja Abdul Rahman bin Andak on advice and assistance in running the affairs of the state.

The Resident General of the Federated Malay States, Frank Swettenham proposed to Sultan Ibrahim in November 1899 the construction of a railway line into Johor, in conjunction with his plan for the North-South Main Trunk Railway down the Malay Peninsula. Sultan Ibrahim welcomed Swettenham&#x27;s plan but was weary of British influence in Johor and insisted on financing the construction of the railway line himself. Swettenham was comfortable with Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s prospect of financing the railway line using the state&#x27;s revenue, and submitted his proposals to the Colonial Office in England. The proposals drew scepticism from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, who was aware of Johor&#x27;s financial difficulties and withheld decision. Sultan Ibrahim then sent his adviser Abdul Rahman Andak the following May to London to negotiate with the Colonial Office, and in April 1901, Sultan Ibrahim made a year-long trip to London to seek private English financiers to fund the construction of the railway line and negotiated with the Colonial Office for a railway loan. He managed to obtain a loan for the construction of the railway and the Johor Railway Convention was signed in July 1904 by his adviser, Abdul Rahman Andak, that gave provisions for an extension of the Malayan railway line to be extended into Johor.

Sultan Ibrahim returned to Johor the following year, and expanded the state&#x27;s military forces, JMF. He instituted the Johor Volunteer Forces, which consisted of young Malay boys and served as the state&#x27;s reservist soldiers. In 1906, he granted land concessions to English capitalists and financiers for development purposes. This drew the concern of the Straits Governor, Sir John Anderson, who was not very favourable with Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s intents to detach Johor&#x27;s economic dependence from Singapore. He successfully pressured Sultan Ibrahim to dispense with the services of Abdul Rahman Andak as well as ceding the administrative powers of the railway line to the colonial government the following year after reports of the state&#x27;s troubled finances were revealed.

Sultan Ibrahim was also facing political challenges from the British colonial government, who were ostensibly unhappy about his negligence in his state affairs and were seeking to extend greater political influence into the state. The Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements, Victor Bruce, Lord Elgin had met Sultan Ibrahim in 1906 and advised him to administer the state in favour of British interests and to cut down on his overseas travels to Europe. Sultan Ibrahim was adamant about Elgin&#x27;s advice and was indignant to accept British advice, and was warned two years later by Lord Elgin on the possibility of the British enacting constitutional changes to the state administration. In 1910, Sultan Ibrahim accepted a British adviser for Johor after immense pressure from the colonial government. The British were extremely unhappy with the condition of Johor&#x27;s finances, which was depleted as a result of Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s extensive overseas travels. The British-Resident of Negeri Sembilan, Douglas Graham Campbell was appointed as the first adviser of Johor.

Relations between Sultan Ibrahim and Campbell were excellent within Campbell&#x27;s first year as an adviser, and Sultan Ibrahim gave him support to improve the state administrative system. However, a tenacious relationship was develop as Campbell proposed numerous administrative reforms which were declined by the Sultan. A political scandal erupted in 1912 after Campbell publicly revealed malpractices in the Johor Bahru Prison. Campbell was particularly unhappy with the way the prisoners were incarcated and lobbied to the British authorities to take charge of the administrative affairs of the prison which caused protest from the Sultan. Grievances between the Sultan&#x27;s administration and the colonial government over the administrative control of the state railway remained unabated during this period, and the Menteri Besar of Johor, Dato&#x27; Abdullah bin Jaafar was delegated to handle these matters.

Shortly after his fallout with Campbell, Sultan Ibrahim implemented a state executive council (Malay: &quot;Masyurat Kerja&quot;) to oversee the administration of state agricultural and mining activities. The Sultan distanced himself from the Campbell and the state&#x27;s legal adviser, Michael Whitley and took administrative matters into his own hands. This incited worry and unhappiness in Campbell and Whitley, and they submitted a memorandum to the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Arthur Henderson Young to appeal for greater British administrative control over the state. Young gave provisions to Campbell with the power similar to a British Resident-General from other states, but kept the title of &quot;General Adviser&quot; to show protocol deference to the Sultan. Sultan Ibrahim was unhappy with the new proposals as the British adviser would have more direct control over the state affairs, but Young assured the Sultan that he would be available for consultation in the event that they had differing opinions. A treaty was signed on 12 May 1914, which formalised the powers of the state&#x27;s General Adviser.

===World War I and Interwar years (1914–1941)===
The state economy experienced a budget surplus as a result of an increase in rubber prices for the rest of the 1910s. Campbell served as its General Adviser until his death in June 1918, and between June 1918 until December 1920, five General Advisers were appointed in succession, each of whom only took office for a few months. As the colonial government lacked decisiveness in the state administration, Sultan Ibrahim attempted to extend his influence in the state administration. Hayes Marriot was appointed as the state&#x27;s new General Adviser in December 1920 and reorganised the state administration.

Sultan Ibrahim took on the role of a ceremonial monarch from the 1920s onwards, and his duties were largely limited to gracing various opening ceremonies around Johor. He occasionally expressed his views on the state administration and economic developments whenever he had grievances, which the British colonial government often took into account as a result of his political influence in the state. He began to take time off to travel abroad from 1928, after he began to suffer from chronic gout and myocardial degeneration. He would often visit London and frequented the Colonial Office whenever he had grievances with the state administration. As a result of his frequent complaints of maladministration of state affairs by the local British government, Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s relations with each General Adviser became strained. Sir Cecil Clementi, who served as the governor of the Straits Settlements as well as the high commissioner of the Malay States from 1930 to 1934, remarked in December 1932 that Sultan Ibrahim was too independent in state affairs and proposed to the Sultan that he should approach Clementi in future under the capacity of the high commissioner instead of the Straits Governor. Clementi&#x27;s proposals apparently angered the Sultan, who boycotted the Durbar in February 1934.

Early Malay nationalism took root in Johor during the 1920s as a Malay aristocrat, Onn Jaafar, whom the Sultan had treated as an adopted son, became a journalist and wrote articles on the welfare of the Malays. Some of Onn&#x27;s articles were critical of Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s policies, which strained their personal relations. Sultan Ibrahim expelled Onn from Johor after he published an article in the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, a Singapore-based English tabloid and criticised the Sultan&#x27;s poor treatment of the Johor Military Forces personnel and the welfare of the Orang Asli. Onn became very popular after he continued to cover issues on Malay grievances, and Sultan Ibrahim invited Onn to return to Johor in 1936. Sultan Ibrahim became an active patron of the state&#x27;s forestry department around 1930, and encouraged the state forestry department to designate some of the remaining virgin forests in the state as nature reserves, as Johor had gone through a reduction in timber supplies due to extensive logging before. Nature reserves covered about 15 per cent of the state&#x27;s land area by 1934, mainly in the northern regions of the state.

Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s relations with Clementi&#x27;s successor, Sir Shenton Thomas did not fare well as Thomas attempted to form a centralised Malayan Union by bringing Johor and the other Unfederated Malay States under the direct authority of the Straits Governor. As the Second World War broke out in 1939, Thomas introduced the Pan-Malayan war tax scheme to fund for Britain&#x27;s war efforts. Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s rejected the proposals, and made a £250,000 cash gift to George VI of the United Kingdom on his 44th birthday in 1939 during his trip to Europe in 1939. From 1934 to 1940 the Sultan&#x27;s name was associated with that of the cabaret dancer Cissie Hill.

===Japanese Occupation (1941–1945)===

Sultan Ibrahim became a personal friend of Yoshichika Tokugawa during the 1920s, a member of the Tokugawa clan whose ancestors included the shoguns who ruled Japan from the 16th to the 19th centuries. When the Japanese invaded Malaya, Tokugawa accompanied General Yamashita Tomoyuki&#x27;s troops and was warmly received by Sultan Ibrahim when they reached Johor Bahru at the end of January 1942. Yamashita and his officers then stationed themselves at the Sultan&#x27;s residence, the Istana Bukit Serene and the state secretariat building, the Sultan Ibrahim Building to plan for the invasion of Singapore.

The Japanese established a military government in February, shortly after they settled down in Malaya. Tokugawa was appointed as its political adviser at the recommendation of Sultan Ibrahim. Relations between the military government and the monarchy were initially cordial throughout the Japanese occupation, and Tokugawa briefly envisioned a plan for a united Malay Sultanate over the Malay Peninsula (including Pattani) with Sultan Ibrahim as its figurehead. However, as the Japanese began to experience economic difficulties and military defeats in the Pacific War from 1943 onwards, these plans were dropped and the military government channelled its efforts towards state agriculture. The Japanese continued the British policy of appointing a state adviser in Johor, and Sultan Ibrahim spent most of his time doing leisure activities.

Sultan Ibrahim, on his part, became resentful of the Japanese military government during the later part of the occupation. The Japanese gave orders to the Malay Sultans to contribute an annual stipend of $10,000 to support the Japanese war efforts, and public speeches which the rulers made were drafted by the propaganda department. In particular, Sultan Ibrahim was once publicly criticised, for leaning on his walking stick before Japanese officers. Shortly before the Japanese surrendered in 1945, Sultan Ibrahim was expelled from his residence at the Istana Bukit Serene and was forced to reside at the Istana Pasir Pelangi, the crown prince&#x27;s palace.

===Malay nationalism (1946–1948)===

The British Military Administration set to task of reviving pre-war plans for centralised control over the Malay states within days after British Allied forces landed in Singapore on 5 September 1945. A former Malayan Civil Service legal officer, H.C. Willan, was ordered to interview the Malay rulers and Willan approached Sultan Ibrahim on 8 September. Sultan Ibrahim was living at the Istana Pasir Pelangi with his Romanian wife, and reportedly warmed up to Willan when he first saw him. During the interview with Willan, Sultan Ibrahim spoke bitterly of his experiences during the Japanese occupation, and offered to serve under the British Military Administration. The Sultan asked Willan&#x27;s permission to fly the Union Jack on his car to attend the surrender ceremony on 12 September, and the British military government granted his requests.

Willan made further interviews with other Malay rulers over the next few days, and made assessments of the political situation in each state. His studies were forwarded to the military administration, and Sir Harold MacMichael, the former high commissioner of Palestine was empowered to sign official treaties with the Malay rulers over the Malayan Union proposal. MacMichael made several visits to the Malay rulers, beginning with Sultan Ibrahim in October 1945. The Sultan quickly consented to MacMichael&#x27;s proposal, which was motivated by his strong desire to visit England at the end of the year. MacMichael paid further visits to other Malay rulers over the proposal, and sought their consent on it. Many Malay rulers expressed strong reluctance to signing the treaties with MacMichael, partly because they feared losing their royal status and the prospect of their states falling under Thai political influence.

The treaties provided that United Kingdom had full administrative powers over the Malay states except in areas pertaining to Islamic customs. The Malays strongly protested the treaties, as the treaties had the effect of restricting the spiritual and moral authority of the Malay rulers, which the Malays held in high regard. Communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese were high, and the prospect of granting citizenship to non-Malays was deemed unacceptable to the Malays. In particular, politicians in Johor were extremely unhappy with the willingness of Sultan Ibrahim to sign the treaties with MacMichael, and voiced that the Sultan Ibrahim had violated the Johor State Constitution which explicitly forbade any foreign powers to assume legitimate control over the state. In early February 1946, seven political dissidents led by Awang bin Hassan organised a rally to protest against the Sultan&#x27;s decision to sign the treaties, and Onn Jaafar, who was then serving as a district officer in Batu Pahat, was invited to attend the rally.

The rally was held on 1 February 1946 at the Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, and protesters shouted nationalistic slogans and called for the dethronement of Sultan Ibrahim and accused him for committing treason against the Malay race by signing the treaties. News of the rally reached Sultan Ibrahim on 22 February, who was then residing at Grosvenor House Hotel in London. Sultan Ibrahim approached the colonial office and withdrew his support of the proposal, but this did not appease the political dissidents and Onn continued to organise more rallies in the other Malay states to muster further support for his calls against the Malayan Union, and formed United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in May.

Sultan Ibrahim returned to Johor in early September 1947 and attended UMNO&#x27;s second general meeting at the Istana Besar. Although many Johorean politicians still held critical opinions of Sultan Ibrahim over the treaties with MacMichael, the UMNO delegates gave him a rousing welcome when he arrived at the palace. Critical opinions against the Sultan waned after the Federation of Malaya was established the following January, which restored the rulers&#x27; powers. Shortly before Sultan Ibrahim left for England in May, he personally donated $5,000 to UMNO, hoping to improve relations with UMNO leaders and Onn himself, who had been appointed the Menteri Besar of Johor in 1946.

===Pre-independence Malaya (1948–1957)===

The establishment of the federation did not go down well with the Chinese, as favourable conditions for obtaining citizenship for the Chinese and other non-Malays were withdrawn. The Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) was formed in 1949 under the leadership of a Straits Chinese businessman, Tan Cheng Lock who frequently raised grievances over the citizenship terms that were set when the federation was established. As a result, communal tensions between the Malays and Chinese surfaced, and Onn kept his distance from Tan. Tan encountered initial difficulties with meeting the Sultan, who was not accustomed to working with Chinese businessmen. Sultan Ibrahim also became increasingly disappointed in Onn&#x27;s work commitment, whom he saw as neglecting state affairs as a result of his commitments towards the UMNO. In early 1950, Sultan Ibrahim approached Onn, who was asked to choose between committing his efforts to the state or the UMNO. Onn chose to the latter, and resigned as the Menteri Besar of Johor in May.

Sultan Ibrahim became increasingly uncomfortable with the idea of Johor as a state within the Federation of Malaya, particularly when the prospect of an independent federation free from British interference became increasingly clear under Tunku Abdul Rahman&#x27;s leadership. In a letter which he wrote to &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in 1953, &quot;Straits Settlement Forever&quot;, Sultan Ibrahim expressed a sceptical opinion of Johor&#x27;s future as part of an independent Malaya, and voiced support for the continuation of British Adviser system in Johor. At his Diamond Jubilee celebrations in September 1955, Sultan Ibrahim publicly called for Johor&#x27;s secession from the Federation. Sultan Ibrahim&#x27;s calls for secession inspired the formation of the &quot;Persatuan Kebangsaan Melayu Johor&quot; (PKMJ) the following month, a secessionist movement led by Ungku Abdullah bin Omar, a relative of Sultan Ibrahim who was serving as one of Johor&#x27;s state executive councillor. The Sultan voiced public support for the PKMJ during a public gathering in mid-December 1955, and the PKMJ courted considerable grassroot support from in first half of 1956.

The Alliance Party reacted strongly to the events which motivated the formation of the PKMJ, and called for the Alliance-dominated Johor state executive council to vet all future state-policy speeches that will be made by the Sultan or members of the royal family. In particular, the Alliance Party reacted with great hostility to the existence of the PKMJ, and actively attempted to suppress and discredit the party. The PKMJ rapidly lost most of its members to UMNO, and by mid-1957 Ungku Abdullah only had ten members left in the party. Meanwhile, at the Conference of Rulers in March 1957, Tunku Abdul Rahman expressed his desire to elect Sultan Ibrahim as the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia, but Sultan Ibrahim declined on grounds of his old age and desire to lead his final years in retirement.

Four months later in July 1957, Ungku Abdullah made one last call to urge Sultan Ibrahim not to sign the Malayan Federal Constitution. The Sultan, who was now residing in London, replied to Ungku Abdullah that he had empowered the Tunku Mahkota, Tunku Ismail (later Sultan Ismail) to decide on the matter. Ungku Abdullah then called upon Tunku Ismail not to sign the constitution, but his calls were ignored and Tunku Ismail proceeded to sign the constitution at the ruler&#x27;s meeting. Following the ordeal, Ungku Abdullah formally disbanded the party a few days before Malaya&#x27;s declaration of independence on 31 August.

==Foreign relations==

Sultan Ibrahim spent much of his time residing in England, often dealing with the colonial office in London over state affairs. His relations with the United Kingdom were often strained over both state and personal matters, especially with leading figures from the colonial office. From the mid-1930s onwards, Sultan Ibrahim fostered personal friends with the British monarchs, and made a cash donation of £500,000 for the Silver Jubilee of King George V, much of which was used to fund the construction of the Singapore Naval Base at Sembawang. Three years later, Sultan Ibrahim made a detour to Germany during his visit to Europe and met with Adolf Hitler and was briefly detained by the French police following the visit when they mistook him for a spy.

Sultan Ibrahim also became a close acquaintance with Yoshichika Tokugawa after the latter visited Johor in 1921. They became friends, partly due to their shared interest in tiger hunting, as well as Tokugawa&#x27;s ability to communicate in fluent Malay. Tokugawa&#x27;s personal friendship with the Sultan encouraged Japanese businessmen to invest in the state&#x27;s rubber plantations from the 1920s onwards. The Sultan visited Japan in 1934, at the invitation of Tokugawa.

==Wealth==

During his reign, the Sultan was considered to be &quot;fabulously wealthy.&quot; He also had a reputation as a wild international playboy. His exploits included changing the colour of his racing horse to present it as an unknown with better odds and going to the red-light area of Vienna. He gave a pair of Malayan tigers to the Edinburgh Zoo and sent a huge cash present to King George V on his Jubilee.

The Sultan was an Anglophile and spent much of his life away from Johor, preferring the more liberal delights of Europe. He sent his sons, by his Malay wives, to be educated in Britain.

The Sultan was reported to have given Sultanah Helen Ibrahim a spectacular jewel collection, reputedly giving her an emerald on her birthday and a diamond on their wedding anniversary, even after the divorce.

==Family==

Sultan Ibrahim was the only son of Che Wan Abu Bakar, Temenggung of Johor by Che Puan Besar Zubaidah (née Cecilia Catharina Lange, 1848–1936). Zubaidah was the daughter of Mads Johansen Lange; a Balinese-based Danish businessman and his Chinese wife, Nonna Sang Nio (born Ong Sang Nio). Nonna, who was born in Southern China, lived in East Java for a time prior to her marriage to Lange. He had one sister, Mariam (born 1871).

===Marriage===

Sultan Ibrahim married at least four official wives who became sultanahs of Johor. They were:
# Ungku Maimunah Binti Ungku Abdul Majid (died 1909); married 5 October 1892, they had one son, Tunku Ismail (Sultan of Johor) (28 October 1894–10 May 1981).
# Enche&#x27; Rogayah (died 1926); married in 1920, they had one son, Tunku Haris Abu Bakar (Tunku Aris Bendahara of Johor) (17 February 1898–1 May 1956). 
# Enche&#x27; Hasnah Binti Dato&#x27; Ja&#x27;afar: Hasnah was the daughter of Dato&#x27; Ja&#x27;afar bin Haji Muhammad, the first Johor Menteri Besar, and the younger sister of Dato&#x27; Onn Bin Ja&#x27;afar, He also had a son by Hasnah Binti Dato&#x27; Ja&#x27;afar: Tunku Ahmad (Tunku Temenggong of Johor) (28 July 1898–26 October 1983).
# Ungku Intan Binti Ungku Ahmad: Married in 1926, Ungku Intan was the daughter of Ungku Ahmad bin Ungku Muhammad.
# Helen Bartholomew Wilson (1899–1977), former wife of William Brockie Wilson; married 15 October 1930, divorced 30 March 1938.
# Marcella Mendl (1915–1982), daughter of Edgar Mendl from Romania and cousin of British diplomat Sir Charles Mendl. Upon converting to Islam, she took the name &quot;Fawzia binti &#x27;Abdu&#x27;llah&quot; and was known as &quot;Lady Marcella Ibrahim&quot; (1940–1955) and Her Highness Sultana Fawzia binti &#x27;Abdu&#x27;llah (1955–1982). Married in 1940, they had one daughter, Tunku Meriam (18 September 1950–4 July 2014) (married, 1976–1980, to British rock star Barry Sapherson, aka Barry Ryan) Besides Malay, she was fluent in several European languages such as German, French, and English.

==Death==
Sultan Ibrahim spent the last two years of his life at his apartment at Grosvenor House Hotel in London. He spent most of his time watching television and visiting theatres and enjoyed the company of his sixth wife, Marcella Mendl and their beloved daughter, Tunku Meriam. The Sultan died on 8 May 1959 at his apartment, with his wife reportedly at his bedside during his last hours. Tunku Ismail succeeded his father as the Sultan of Johor, and many Malay and British leaders who worked with him publicly expressed their condolences to the late Sultan within the first two weeks of his death. The Sultan&#x27;s body was shipped back to Johor Bahru and arrived the following month, where he was given a state funeral and with body laying in state between 4 and 6 June at the Istana Besar.

At the time of his death, Sultan Ibrahim was the longest reigning Sultan of Johor, having ruled for 64 years.

==Legacy==

In recent years, efforts have been made by the Sultan&#x27;s heirs to rehabilitate his image and paint him as a benevolent ruler. Critics claim that he is largely remembered as an anti-independence figure, a wastrel and a close ally of the British. Even with that view, he is viewed as the man whom continued his father&#x27;s legacy of investing in pepper, gambier and rubber, which largely improved the economic situation of Johor. The posthumous title of &quot;the Great&quot; (in Malay, &quot;mil Masyhur&quot;) conferred on him by his grandson Sultan Iskandar, never caught on.

In 1938, Blyukher was arrested during the period of military purges under Joseph Stalin. He was tortured and blinded by Lavrentiy Beria and his men before succumbing to his injuries. His body was then incinerated on the orders of Stalin.

== Early history ==

Blyukher was born into a Russian peasant family named Gurov, in the village of Barschinka in Yaroslavl Governorate. In the 19th century a landlord gave the nickname &quot;Blyukher&quot; to the Gurov family in commemoration of the famous Prussian Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher (1742–1819). As a teenager, he was employed at a machine works, but was arrested in 1910 for leading a strike, and sentenced to two years, eight months in prison. In 1914, Vasily Gurov — who later formally assumed &quot;Blyukher&quot; as his surname — was drafted into the army of the Russian Empire as a corporal but in 1915 was seriously wounded in the Great Retreat, and excused from military service. He then went to work in a factory in Kazan, where he joined the Bolshevik Party in 1916. He took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917 in Samara.

== Civil War ==

In late November 1917 the Red Guard forces of Commander V. K. Sadlutskii and Commissar Blyukher moved from Samara to Chelyabinsk to suppress Alexander Dutov&#x27;s revolt. Blyukher joined the Red Army in 1918 and soon became a commander. During the Russian Civil War of 1917–1923, he was one of the outstanding figures on the Bolshevik side. After the Czech Legion revolt started in May 1918, the 10,000-strong South Urals Partisan Army under Blyukher&#x27;s command marched 1,500 km in 40 days (August–September 1918) of continuous fighting to attack White forces from the rear, then joined with regular Red Army units. For this achievement in September 1918, he became the first recipient of the Order of the Red Banner (later he was awarded it four more times: twice in 1921 and twice in 1928), the citation read: &quot;The raid made by Comrade Blyukher&#x27;s forces under impossible conditions can only be equated with Suvorov&#x27;s crossings in Switzerland.&quot;

After Blyukher&#x27;s troops rejoined the Red Army lines in the 3rd Red Army area of the Eastern Front, his force was reorganised as the 51st Rifle Division, which he later led to further triumphs against Baron Wrangel in November 1920. After the Civil War he served as military commander of the Far Eastern Republic from 1921 to 1922. From December 1921, he took personal command of the campaign to remove the remnants of anti-Bolshevik forces east of the Amur river. In 1922−1924, he served as the commander of the Petrograd military district.

== Far East command ==
From 1924 to 1927 Blyukher was a Soviet military adviser in China, where he used the name Galen (after the name of his wife, Galina) while attached to Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s military headquarters. He was responsible for the military planning of the Northern Expedition which began the Kuomintang unification of China. Among those he instructed in this period was Lin Biao, later a leading figure in the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army. Chiang allowed Blyukher to &quot;escape&quot; after his anti-communist purge. On his return he was given command of the Ukrainian Military District, and then in 1929 he was transferred to the vitally important military command in the Far Eastern Military District, known as the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army (OKDVA).

Based at Khabarovsk, Blyukher exercised a degree of autonomy in the Far East unusual for a Soviet military commander. With Japan steadily extending its grip on China and hostile to the Soviet Union, the Far East was an active military command. In the Russo-Chinese Chinese Eastern Railroad War of 1929–30 he defeated Chinese warlord forces in a quick campaign. For this outstanding achievement he became the first recipient of the Order of the Red Star in September 1930, and became popularly known as the &quot;Red Napoleon&quot;. In 1935 he was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union. From July to August 1938 he commanded the Soviet Far East Front in a less decisive action against the Japanese at the Battle of Lake Khasan, on the border between the Soviet Union and Japanese-occupied Korea.

== Soviet purges and death ==
The importance of the Far East Front gave Blyukher a certain degree of immunity from Stalin&#x27;s purge of Red Army command, which had begun in 1937 with execution of Mikhail Tukhachevsky—in fact, Blyukher had been a member of the tribunal that convicted Tukhachevsky. On 15 June 1938, three days after the head of the Far Eastern NKVD Genrikh Lyushkov defected to Japan, Blyukher visited NKVD headquarters in Moscow, seeking information about the defector and about potential consequences of his disappearance. He met the deputy head of the NKVD, Mikhail Frinovsky, who appears to have reassured him that he would not be held responsible for letting Lyushkov cross the Manchurian border. On 17 June, Frinovsky and the head of the Red Army political directorate, Lev Mekhlis, were dispatched to the Far East to conduct mass arrests, and to spy on Blyukher. He was arrested on 22 October, by which time Frinovsky had been dismissed and the NKVD was effectively controlled by Lavrentiy Beria.

It was long believed that Blyukher was secretly tried, convicted of spying for Japan, and executed. In 1939 Chiang Kai-shek inquired about Blyukher&#x27;s whereabouts in a meeting with Stalin, and asked if he could return to help the Nationalists. Stalin replied that the general had been executed for helping a Japanese spy. 

As early as February 1956, it was secretly reported to the party leadership, by a commission appointed to investigate the purges, that a former officer had seen Blyukher while he was under interrogation, and that &quot;his whole face was swollen and covered in bruises.&quot; Unlike most prisoners subjected to this kind of torture, he did not sign a false confession, but after 18 days of torture, he died from his injuries, on 9 November 1938. His body was cremated the same day. The cause of his death was first reported in 1989, in &quot;Izvestia&quot;. The officer who beat Blyukher to death has been named as Lev Shvartzman. 

Blyukher was rehabilitated in 1956.

He continues to be a popular figure in Russia, and a documentary film on his life and several publications by family members have appeared.

<text>Pelleas , or Pellias, is an Arthurian Knight of the Round Table whose story first appears in the Post-Vulgate Cycle. He becomes the husband of Nimue, the Lady of the Lake in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. His character might have been connected to the figure of Pwyll, the fairy Rhiannon&#x27;s human husband in Welsh mythology.

In the Post-Vulgate, Pellias, the son of a poor vavasour, seeks the love of the high-born maiden, named Arcade or Archade. Though he wins her a golden circlet in a tournament, she spurns him, holes up in her castle refusing to see him, and sends her knights daily to humiliate him in hopes of driving him away. During the course of unrelated adventures, Gawain, Arthur&#x27;s nephew, witnesses Pellias&#x27;s humiliation and vows to help him by going to Arcade wearing Pellias&#x27; armour so that it appears that Pellias killed Gawain. Once in her confidences, Gawain plans to woo Arcade on behalf of Pellias, delivering her to him. Instead, Gawain falls for Arcade himself, his passion causing him to forget his promise to Pellias. When Gawain does not return with the maiden, Pellias seeks them out and finds them in bed together. Though distraught, Pellias cannot bring himself to kill them, so leaves his bare sword between them in the bed and returns home, where he says he will never leave his bed until he dies from grief. The next morning, Arcade recognises the sword and Gawain remembers his promise. He convinces Arcade to love Pellias and arranges for them to meet. The pair marry and have a son, Guivret the Younger, who later becomes one of Arthur&#x27;s knights. 

Thomas Malory reworked the Post-Vulgate story in the first book of his seminal compilation &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. There, Gawain leaves the maiden—who in this version is called Ettarde—after the incident with the sword. Nimue, one of the Ladies of the Lake, comes upon Pelleas, hears his story, and falls in love with him herself. She takes vengeance on Ettarde by magic, enchanting her to fall in love with Pelleas as deeply as he loved her. Pelleas, whose love has turned to hate, spurns Ettarde, and she dies of sorrow. Nimue and Pelleas fall in love and marry.

Pelleas also appears as a minor character at other points in both of these works. He is active fighting in tournaments and defending Guinevere from her abductor Maleagant as one of the Queen&#x27;s Knights. 

In Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, Pelleas is knighted by Arthur at a young age. As a young knight, he deeply loves the maiden named Ettarre who finds his youthful shyness and stammering bothersome and does not return his affection. She lies to him to induce him to give her a golden arm circlet, the prize of a tournament that he won, as a token of his love. Ettarre, selfish and having gained the circlet and thus some social elevation, desires to be left alone; but despite her treachery Pelleas cannot forget her. He defeats all knights sent by her but, after each victory, deliberately allows himself to be captured and taken prisoner to her castle, as it is the only way that he can ever see his true love. Unsympathetic, Ettarre takes his horse from him and sends him on his way, only to return again and again. Gawain offers to try to persuade Ettarre to love Pelleas. Gawain instead lies to her, telling her he has slain Pelleas, and betrays him, sleeping with her himself. Pelleas finds the two together sleeping, and leaves his sword on their chests, revealing that he is alive and well, but also as a sign of honour, as he says he cannot kill a knight such as Gawain in his sleep.

<text>Robert Fuchs (15 February 1847 – 19 February 1927) was an Austrian composer and music teacher. As Professor of music theory at the Vienna Conservatory, Fuchs taught many notable composers, while he was himself a highly regarded composer in his lifetime.

==Biography==

He was born in Frauental an der Laßnitz, Styria, Austria in 1847. He studied at the Vienna Conservatory with Felix Otto Dessoff and Joseph Hellmesberger among others. He eventually secured a teaching position there and was appointed Professor of music theory in 1875. He retained the position until 1912. He died in Vienna in 1927.

He was the youngest brother of Johann Nepomuk Fuchs, who was also a composer and an opera conductor.

Robert Fuchs taught many notable composers, 

==Notability==

&quot;Unfailingly tuneful and enjoyable, Robert Fuchs&#x27;s piano trios are an easily accessible way to get to know a composer whom Brahms greatly admired,&quot; noted the magazine Gramophone. &quot;In his time Fuchs was very highly regarded, with one critic famously pointing to Fuchsisms in Mahler&#x27;s Second Symphony.&quot;

The reason his compositions did not become better known was largely that he did little to promote them, living a quiet life in Vienna and refusing to arrange concerts, even when the opportunities arose. He certainly had his admirers, among them Brahms, who almost never praised the works of other composers. But with regard to Fuchs, Brahms wrote, &quot;Fuchs is a splendid musician, everything is so fine and so skillful, so charmingly invented, that one is always pleased.&quot; Famous contemporary conductors, including Arthur Nikisch, Felix Weingartner and Hans Richter, championed his works when they had the opportunity with few exceptions, but it was his chamber music which was considered his finest work.

In his lifetime, his best known works were his five serenades; their popularity was so great that Fuchs acquired the nickname &quot;Serenaden-Fuchs&quot; (roughly, &quot;Serenader Fox&quot;). The serenades have been recorded by the Cologne Chamber Orchestra under Christian Ludwig for Naxos.

<doc id="611318" wikidata="Q214568" url="?curid=611318" title="Île-d'Aix">
<text>Île-d&#x27;Aix () is a commune in the French department of Charente-Maritime, region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine (before 2015: Poitou-Charentes), off the west coast of France. It occupies the territory of the small Isle of Aix (), in the Atlantic Ocean. It is a popular place for tourist day-trips during the summer months.

==Location==
Île-d&#x27;Aix is located at the mouth of the river Charente, between Oléron Island and the coast of mainland France. The island is also close to Fort Boyard.

==History==
During the Roman period, it seems the island was connected to the continent at low tide. It took its current shape around 1500.

In 1067, Isembert de Châtelaillon gave the island to the order of Cluny. A small convent was established, which depended on St Martin in Île de Ré.

At the end of the 12th century, France and England fought for the possession of the island. Until 1286, the island was located at the boundary between the French and the English Saintonge, formed by the estuary of the river Charente. During the Hundred Years War, the island became English for about 15 years.

In the 16th century, during the French Wars of Religion, the island became Catholic and then Protestant.

In 1665, nearby Rochefort was established as a strategic harbour for the Kingdom, leading to the construction of many fortifications in the area. Vauban built numerous fortifications on the island, which Ferry completed in 1704.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), the British captured the island in 1757 and destroyed its ramparts as part of the attempted Raid on Rochefort, before withdrawing several weeks later. The island was again captured by British forces in 1759 following the Battle of Quiberon Bay and occupied until the end of the war in 1763. The fortifications were then rebuilt by several French officers, including Marc René, marquis de Montalembert and Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, the author of &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;.

During the French Revolution, in 1794, the island was used as a prison for the suppression of religious opponents in which hundreds of priests were left to die in moored prison-boats. About 226 were buried in the sands of Île-d&#x27;Aix.

===Napoleonic period===
Napoleon famously visited the island in 1808 and gave directions to reinforce the fortifications. He ordered the construction of a house for the commander of the stronghold (today&#x27;s &quot;Musée Napoléon&quot;) and the construction of Fort Liedot, named after a colonel killed in the Russian campaign.

In 1809, the Battle of the Basque Roads (French: &quot;Bataille de l&#x27;Île d&#x27;Aix&quot;) was a naval battle off the island of Aix between the Royal Navy and the Atlantic Fleet of the French Navy. On the night of 11 April 1809, Captain Thomas Cochrane led a British fireship attack against a squadron of French warships anchored in the Basque Roads. In the attack, all but two of the French ships were driven ashore. The subsequent engagement lasted three days but failed to completely destroy the French fleet.

From 12 to 15 July 1815, after the defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon spent his last days in France at Île d&#x27;Aix, in an attempt to slip past a Royal Navy blockade and escape to North America. Realising the impossibility of accomplishing his plan, he wrote a letter to the British regent and finally surrendered to HMS &quot;Bellerophon&quot;, which took him to Torbay and Plymouth before he was transferred to Saint Helena.

==Population==
It has a population of 223 as of 2008.

==Sights==
Located on the island is the large Fort Liédot, which functioned as a military prison from the early 19th century to the 1960s. The Algerian independentist and future President Ben Bella was imprisoned there from 1956 to 1962, together with other National Liberation Front militants such as Mohamed Khider and Hocine Aït Ahmed.

==Transport==
Access to the island is provided by a year-round ferry, which leaves several times a day from Fouras, just east of the island, or from La Rochelle, and Oléron, during the summer months. Cars (except for service vehicles) are prohibited on the island, which allows more tranquility. People move around on foot or by bicycle. Horse carriages are also available to travel on the island.

<doc id="611319" wikidata="Q5081969" url="?curid=611319" title="Charles Reed Bishop">
<text>Charles Reed Bishop (January 25, 1822 – June 7, 1915) was an American businessman, politician, and philanthropist in Hawaii. Born in Glens Falls, New York, he sailed to Hawaii in 1846 at the age of 24, and made his home there, marrying into the royal family of the kingdom. He served several monarchs in appointed positions in the kingdom, before its overthrow in 1893 by Americans from the United States and organization as the Territory of Hawaii.

Bishop was one of the first trustees of and a major donor to the Kamehameha Schools, founded by his late wife&#x27;s request to provide education to Hawaiian children. He founded Hawaii&#x27;s first successful bank, now known as First Hawaiian Bank. Based on his business success, he also founded the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, named for his late wife.

==Early life==
On January 25, 1822, Charles Reed Bishop was born to Maria (Reed) and Samuel Bishop in Glen Falls, New York. His father was a toll collector for ship traffic on the Hudson River near the town. Charles&#x27; mother Maria died two weeks after giving birth to her next son, Henry. Their father Samuel Bishop died when Charles was four, and the boy was taken in by his grandfather on his farm in Warrensburg and, by 15, was working for Nelson J. Warren in the town&#x27;s largest store. Charles Bishop worked on his grandfather&#x27;s farm, learning how to care for sheep, cattle, and horses. While living with his grandfather, Bishop was baptized in a Methodist church.

Bishop spent his early years of education at a village school, and finished his formal schooling at 8th grade, as was customary for many boys in that period. Bishop was hired as a clerk and soon started working for Nelson J. Warren, who headed the largest mercantile company in Warrensburg.

He befriended William Little Lee (1821–1857) from nearby Hudson Falls, then called Sandy Hill. Charles&#x27; paternal uncle Linus Bishop married Lee&#x27;s sister Eliza. After attending Harvard Law School, Lee persuaded Bishop to go with him to the Oregon Territory for new opportunities.

==In Hawaii==

The two young men sailed for Oregon on the &quot;Henry&quot; out of New York City, leaving February 23, 1846. By October the ship had rounded Cape Horn and needed to stop in Honolulu for provisions. At this time, the islands were still governed by the Kingdom of Hawaii, but numerous Americans were settling there for business opportunities and as missionaries. Lee was recruited to stay as the second western-trained lawyer in the Hawaiian islands; he was later appointed as the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Bishop decided to stay as well. He soon was hired by some Americans to sort out the failed land deal of Ladd &amp; Co., which was the first major formal law proceeding. He next worked for the U.S. Consul.

On February 27, 1849 Bishop became accepted as a citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He became an investor with Henry A. Peirce and Lee in a sugarcane plantation on the island of Kauai, near where the Ladd company had been somewhat successful. From 1849 to 1853 he served as Collector General of Customs.

He courted On Bernice Pauahi Pākī despite her resistance, and on June 4, 1850, he married, Bernice Pauahi Pākī of the royal House of Kamehameha, despite the objections of her parents. Their private ceremony in the Royal School was not attended by her family. Within a year her father Pākī made peace with the marriage and invited the couple to live in the family estate called Haleakala. 

Bishop formed a partnership with William A. Aldrich, selling merchandise to be shipped to supply the California Gold Rush. He became known as a trusted person with whom traders could deposit and exchange the various currencies in use at the time.

In 1853 Bishop was elected as representative to the legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom.

===Bank===

On August 17, 1858, Aldrich split off the shipping business. Bishop founded Bishop &amp; Co. as the first chartered bank in the Kingdom. It is the second oldest bank west of the Rocky Mountains. On its first day it took in $4784.25 in deposits. By 1878 it outgrew its basement room and expanded to a two-story building. This structure is designated as a contributing property to the Merchant Street Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

In 1895 Bishop sold the bank to Samuel Mills Damon (1841–1924), son of American missionary Samuel C. Damon (1815–1885). Over time the bank grew and in 1960 was renamed as First Hawaiian Bank, formalizing its role in state history.

===Service===
Bishop served on the Privy Council for five Hawaiian monarchs from 1859–1891, and was appointed to the House of Nobles 1859–1886 by King Kamehameha IV. From 1869 to 1891, he served as an appointee to the Board of Education. During the brief reign of King Lunalilo, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from January 10, 1873, to February 17, 1874.

Bishop was one of the first trustees of and major donor to the Kamehameha Schools, founded at his late wife&#x27;s bequest to provide education to Hawaiian children. He also was a founder of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, which he named after his late wife. Bishop hired William Tufts Brigham, whom he had met on a scientific visit in 1864 with Horace Mann Jr., to be the museum&#x27;s first director. He also donated funds for buildings at the private Punahou School. Bishop was elected and served as president of the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce 1883–1885 and 1888–1894.

After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, in 1893, Bishop left Hawaii in 1894 and settled in San Francisco, California. He became vice-president of the Bank of California, serving until his death on June 7, 1915. He stayed involved in his Hawaiian estate affairs from California. For example, he hired architects Clinton Briggs Ripley and Charles William Dickey to design a new building for the Bishop estate headquarters, and for Pauahi Hall on the Punahou School campus.

==Death==
Bishop died in 1915 at the age of 93 in San Francisco, California. His ashes were returned to Hawaii and interred next to his wife&#x27;s remains at the Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii.

A major street cutting through Bishop property in downtown Honolulu at was named Bishop.

<doc id="611323" wikidata="Q60080" url="?curid=611323" title="Wilhelm Dilthey">
<text>Wilhelm Dilthey (; ; 19 November 1833 – 1 October 1911) was a German historian, psychologist, sociologist, and hermeneutic philosopher, who held Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel&#x27;s Chair in Philosophy at the University of Berlin. As a polymathic philosopher, working in a modern research university, Dilthey&#x27;s research interests revolved around questions of scientific methodology, historical evidence and history&#x27;s status as a science.

Dilthey has often been considered an empiricist, in contrast to the idealism prevalent in Germany at the time, but his account of what constitutes the empirical and experiential differs from British empiricism and positivism in its central epistemological and ontological assumptions, which are drawn from German literary and philosophical traditions.

==Life==
Dilthey was born in 1833 as the son of a Reformed pastor in the village of Biebrich in the Duchy of Nassau, now in Hesse, Germany. As a young man he followed family traditions by studying theology at Heidelberg University, where his teachers included the young Kuno Fischer. He then moved to the University of Berlin and was taught by, amongst others, Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg and August Böckh, both former pupils of Friedrich Schleiermacher. In January 1864, he received his doctorate from Berlin with a thesis in Latin on Schleiermacher&#x27;s ethics, and in June of the same year he also earned his habilitation with a thesis on moral consciousness. He became a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Berlin in 1865.

In 1859, he edited Schleiermacher&#x27;s letters and soon after he was also commissioned to write a biography—the first volume of which was eventually published in 1870. In 1867 he took up a professorship at the University of Basel, but later—in 1882—he returned to Berlin where he held the prestigious chair in philosophy at the university.

In 1874, he married Katherine Puttmann, and the couple had one son and two daughters.

He died in 1911.

==Work==

===Hermeneutics===
Dilthey took some of his inspiration from the works of Friedrich Schleiermacher on hermeneutics, which he helped revive. Both figures are linked to German Romanticism. Schleiermacher was strongly influenced by German Romanticism which led him to place more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Dilthey, in his turn, as the author of a vast monograph on Schleiermacher, responds to the questions raised by Droysen and Ranke about the philosophical legitimation of the human sciences. He argues that &#x27;scientific explanation of nature&#x27; (&quot;erklären&quot;) must be completed with a theory of how the world is given to human beings through symbolically mediated practices. To provide such a theory is the aim of the philosophy of the humanities—a field of study to which Dilthey dedicated his entire academic career.

The school of Romantic hermeneutics stressed that historically embedded interpreters—a &quot;living&quot; rather than a Cartesian dualism or &quot;theoretical&quot; subject—use &#x27;understanding&#x27; and &#x27;interpretation&#x27; (&quot;Verstehen&quot;), which combine individual-psychological and social-historical description and analysis, to gain a greater knowledge of texts and authors in their contexts. However, Dilthey remains distinct from other German Romantics and life philosophers through his emphasis on &quot;historicality.&quot; Dilthey understood man as a historical being. However, history is not described in terms of an object of the past, but &quot;a series of world views.&quot; Man cannot understand himself through reflection or introspection, but only through what &quot;history can tell him…never in objective concepts but always only in the living experience which springs up out of the depths of his own being.&quot; Dilthey wants to emphasize the &quot;intrinsic temporality of all understanding,&quot; that man&#x27;s understanding is dependent on past worldviews, interpretations, and a shared world.

The process of interpretive inquiry established by Schleiermacher involved what Dilthey called the hermeneutic circle—the recurring movement between the implicit and the explicit, the particular and the whole. Schleiermacher saw the approaches to interpreting sacred scriptures (for example, the Pauline epistles) and Classical texts (e.g. Plato&#x27;s philosophy) as more specific forms of what he proposed as &quot;general hermeneutics&quot; (&quot;allgemeine Hermeneutik&quot;). Schleiermacher approached hermeneutics as the &quot;art of understanding&quot; and recognized both the importance of language, and the thoughts of an author, to interpreting a text.

Dilthey saw understanding as the key for the human sciences (&quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot;) in contrast with the natural sciences. The natural sciences observe and explain nature, but the humanities understand human expressions of life. So long as a science is &quot;accessible to us through a procedure based on the systematic relation between life, expression, and understanding&quot; Dilthey considered it a part of the human sciences.

Along with Friedrich Nietzsche, Georg Simmel and Henri Bergson, Dilthey&#x27;s work influenced early twentieth-century &quot;Lebensphilosophie&quot; and &quot;Existenzphilosophie&quot;. Dilthey&#x27;s students included Bernhard Groethuysen, Hans Lipps, Herman Nohl, Theodor Litt, Eduard Spranger, Georg Misch and Erich Rothacker. Dilthey&#x27;s philosophy also influenced the religious philosopher Martin Buber.

Dilthey&#x27;s works informed the early Martin Heidegger&#x27;s approach to hermeneutics in his early lecture courses, in which he developed a &quot;hermeneutics of factical life,&quot; and in &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927). But Heidegger grew increasingly critical of Dilthey, arguing for a more radical &quot;temporalization&quot; of the possibilities of interpretation and human existence.

In &quot;Wahrheit und Methode&quot; (&quot;Truth and Method&quot;, 1960), Hans-Georg Gadamer, influenced by Heidegger, criticised Dilthey&#x27;s approach to hermeneutics as both overly aesthetic and subjective as well as method-oriented and &quot;positivistic.&quot; According to Gadamer, Dilthey&#x27;s hermeneutics is insufficiently concerned with the ontological event of truth and inadequately considers the implications of how the interpreter and the interpreter&#x27;s interpretations are not outside of tradition but occupy a particular position within it, i.e., have a temporal horizon.

===Psychology===
Dilthey was interested in psychology. In his work &quot;Ideas Concerning a Descriptive and Analytic Psychology&quot; (&quot;Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie&quot;, 1894), he introduced a distinction between explanatory psychology (&quot;erklärende Psychologie&quot;; also explanative psychology) and descriptive psychology (&quot;beschreibende Psychologie&quot;; also analytic psychology, &quot;zergliedernde Psychologie&quot;): in his terminology, explanatory psychology is the study of psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view, which involves their subordination to a system of causality, while descriptive psychology is a discipline that attempts to explicate how different mental processes converge in the &quot;structural nexus of consciousness.&quot;

The distinction is based on the more general distinction between explanatory/explanative sciences (&quot;erklärende Wissenschaften&quot;), on the one hand, and interpretive sciences (&quot;beschreibende Wissenschaften&quot; or &quot;verstehende Wissenschaften&quot;, that is, the sciences which are based on the &quot;Verstehen&quot; method), on the other—see below.

In his later work (&quot;Der Aufbau der geschichtlichen Welt in den Geisteswissenschaften&quot;, 1910), he used the alternative term structural psychology (&quot;Strukturpsychologie&quot;) for descriptive psychology.

===Sociology===
Dilthey was also interested in what some would call sociology in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. He objected to their dialectical/evolutionist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, as well as their narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte&#x27;s idea of positivism was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did however have good things to say about the neo-Kantian sociology of Georg Simmel, with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of Max Weber, the primary founder of sociological antipositivism. J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of nonpositivist &quot;verstehende&quot; sociology and the &quot;Verstehen&quot; method.

===Distinction between natural sciences and human sciences===
A lifelong concern was to establish a proper theoretical and methodological foundation for the &quot;human sciences&quot; (e.g. history, law, literary criticism), distinct from, but equally &quot;scientific&quot; as, the &quot;natural sciences&quot; (e.g. physics, chemistry). He suggested that all human experience divides naturally into two parts: that of the surrounding natural world, in which &quot;objective necessity&quot; rules, and that of inner experience, characterized by &quot;sovereignty of the will, responsibility for actions, a capacity to subject everything to thinking and to resist everything within the fortress of freedom of his/her own person&quot;.

Dilthey strongly rejected using a model formed exclusively from the natural sciences (&quot;Naturwissenschaften&quot;), and instead proposed developing a separate model for the human sciences (&quot;Geisteswissenschaften&quot;). His argument centered around the idea that in the natural sciences we seek to explain phenomena in terms of cause and effect, or the general and the particular; in contrast, in the human sciences, we seek to &quot;understand&quot; (&quot;verstehen&quot;) in terms of the relations of the part and the whole. In the social sciences we may also combine the two approaches, a point stressed by German sociologist Max Weber. His principles, a general theory of understanding or comprehension (&quot;Verstehen&quot;) could, he asserted, be applied to all manner of interpretation ranging from ancient texts to art work, religious works, and even law. His interpretation of different theories of aesthetics in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries was preliminary to his speculations concerning the form aesthetic theory would take in the twentieth century.

Both the natural and human sciences originate in the context or &quot;nexus&quot; of life (&quot;Lebenszusammenhang&quot;), a concept which influenced the phenomenological account of the lifeworld (&quot;Lebenswelt&quot;), but are differentiated in how they relate to their life-context. Whereas the natural sciences abstract away from it, it becomes the primary object of inquiry in the human sciences.

Dilthey defended his use of the term &quot;Geisteswissenschaft&quot; (literally, &quot;science of the mind&quot; or &quot;spiritual knowledge&quot;) by pointing out that other terms such as &quot;social science&quot; and &quot;cultural sciences&quot; are equally one-sided and that the human mind or spirit is the central phenomenon from which all others are derived and analyzable. For Dilthey, like Hegel, &quot;Geist&quot; (&quot;mind&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot;) has a cultural rather than a social meaning. It is not an abstract intellectual principle or disembodied behavioral experience but refers to the individual&#x27;s life in its concrete cultural-historical context.

===Weltanschauungen===
In 1911, Dilthey developed a typology of the three basic &quot;Weltanschauungen&quot;, or World-Views, which he considered to be &quot;typical&quot; (comparable to Max Weber&#x27;s notion of &quot;ideal types&quot;) and conflicting ways of conceiving of humanity&#x27;s relation to Nature.
* in Naturalism, represented by Epicureans of all times and places, humans see themselves as determined by nature
* in the Idealism of Freedom (or Subjective Idealism), represented by Friedrich Schiller and Immanuel Kant, humans are conscious of their separation from nature by their free will
* in Objective Idealism, represented by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Baruch Spinoza, and Giordano Bruno, humans are conscious of their harmony with nature.
This approach influenced Karl Jaspers&#x27; &quot;Psychology of Worldviews&quot; as well as Rudolf Steiner&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Freedom&quot;.

===Comparison with the Neo-Kantians===
Dilthey&#x27;s ideas should be examined in terms of his similarities and differences with Wilhelm Windelband and Heinrich Rickert, members of the Baden School of Neo-Kantianism. Dilthey was not a Neo-Kantian, but had a profound knowledge of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s philosophy, which deeply influenced his thinking. But whereas Neo-Kantianism was primarily interested in epistemology on the basis of Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, Dilthey took Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Judgment&quot; as his point of departure. An important debate between Dilthey and the Neo-Kantians concerned the &quot;human&quot; as opposed to &quot;cultural&quot; sciences, with the Neo-Kantians arguing for the exclusion of psychology from the cultural sciences and Dilthey for its inclusion as a human science.

==Editorial work==
In 1859, Dilthey was asked to complete the editing of Schleiermacher&#x27;s letters.

Dilthey also inaugurated the academy edition (the &quot;Akademie-Ausgabe&quot; abbreviated as &quot;AA&quot; or &quot;Ak&quot;) of Kant&#x27;s writings (&quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot;, Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin, 1902–38) in 1895, and served as its first editor.

In 1906 he published &quot;Die Jugendgeschichte Hegels&quot; on the earlier Hegel&#x27;s political and theological thought. Subsequently, Dilthey&#x27;s student Herman Nohl analyzed the related fragments and published a volume on the Dilthey&#x27;s history of German Idealism.

<text>Jesus Justus (Greek Ιησούς χω λεγόμενος Ιουστος &quot;Iesous ho legomenos Ioustos&quot;) was one of several Jewish Christians in the church at Rome mentioned by Paul the Apostle in the greetings at the end of the Epistle to the Colossians 4:11.

It is generally thought that Paul wrote Colossians while in prison in Rome most likely during AD 50s. Of those with Paul, Justus, Aristarchus, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, are said in the letter to be &quot;of the circumcision&quot;, that is, Jewish and to have &quot;proved a comfort to me.&quot;

The name &quot;Jesus&quot; was common among Jews in the time of Jesus of Nazareth, being a form of the Old Testament name Joshua (&quot;Yeshua&quot; ישוע). The extra name &quot;Justus&quot; was likely to distinguish him from his Master, Jesus Christ.

Jesus Justus is not mentioned in a similar passage in Philemon 1:23-24 whereas Aristarchus, Epaphras and Mark are again explicitly named by Paul.

<doc id="611329" wikidata="Q426080" url="?curid=611329" title="Elaine (legend)">
<text>Elaine is a name shared by several female characters in Arthurian legend, where they can also appear under different names depending on the source. They include Elaine of Astolat and Elaine of Corbenic among others.

==Elaine of Astolat==
Lady Elaine of Astolat (a common mistake misspelling of &quot;Ascolat&quot;) or Elaine the Fair is a maiden daughter of the lord of Astolat (&quot;Ascolat&quot;, &quot;Escalot&quot;). She falls in unrequited love with Sir Lancelot, leading to her death of sorrow. In modern times, she is also often known as &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; after the eponymous poem.

==Elaine of Benoic==
Queen Elaine of Benoic (Old French: &quot;Élaine de Bénoïc&quot;; alternative forms including &quot;Elainne&quot;, &quot;Elene&quot;, &quot;Helaine&quot;, &quot;Helainne&quot;, &quot;Helayne&quot; and &quot;Helene&quot;; also known as &quot;Provida&quot; or &quot;Perevida&quot;) is wife of King Ban and birth mother of Lancelot. The Vulgate Cycle traces her descent to the holy bloodline of the biblical Israeli king David. Following the conquest of their kingdom of Benoic (known as Benwick in English) by King Claudas, the death of her husband, and the taking of the infant Lancelot by the Lady of the Lake, Elaine becomes known as the Queen of Great Sorrows, living as a nun along with her sister Evaine, the widowed wife of King Bors and mother of Sir Lionel and Sir Bors. In an alternate version from the Italian rewrite &quot;Tavola Ritonda&quot;, the queen is named Gostanza and she dies of distress just few days after Ban&#x27;s death and Lancelot&#x27;s premature birth. The early and even more distinctive German book &quot;Lanzelet&quot; calls its eponymous hero&#x27;s mother Clarine and makes her a sister of Arthur.

==Elaine of Corbenic==


Princess Elaine of Corbenic (also known as &quot;Amite&quot;, and alternatively written &quot;Helaine&quot;, &quot;Heliaebel&quot; or &quot;Helizabel&quot;) is daughter of King Pelles of Corbenic, descended from Joseph of Arimathea. She is identified as &quot;The Grail Maiden&quot; or &quot;Grail Bearer&quot; due to her connection to the Holy Grail. In the Vulgate Cycle, Lady Elaine becomes mother of Sir Galahad after raping Sir Lancelot and later lives with Lancelot as his wife for several years.

==Elaine of Garlot==
Queen Elaine of Garlot (&quot;Garloth&quot;) or Elaine of Tintagel, originally known as Blasine (&quot;Blaasine&quot;, &quot;Basyne&quot;) in the Vulgate &quot;Merlin&quot;, is one of the daughters of Gorlois and Igraine. She is a sister to Morgan and Morgause and a half-sister to Arthur. Elaine marries King Nentres of Garlot and has a son named Galeschin, who becomes a Knight of the Round Table, and a daughter also named Elaine. The form Elaine (&quot;Elayne&quot;) was invented by &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot; author Thomas Malory and without an identifying moniker &quot;of Galot[h]&quot; which he only used for her husband. All texts mention her only very briefly and there is a confusion regarding the sisters within the Vulgate Cycle, with either Belisent (Morgause) or Morgain (Morgan) replacing her as the wife of Nentres in the variants of the Vulgate &quot;Merlin Continuation&quot;.

==Elaine the Peerless==
Lady Elaine the Peerless (&quot;Elaine sans Pere&quot;, &quot;Helaine the Peerless&quot;, &quot;Helayn Withouten Pere&quot;, &quot;Heleine sans Pair&quot;, &quot;Heliene sans Per&quot;, &quot;Heliene without Equal&quot;) is niece of the Lord of the Fens and wife of Persidés the Red of Corbenic. She is introduced in the Vulgate &quot;Lancelot&quot; wherein she is freed from her captivity in her husband&#x27;s castle by Hector de Maris.

==Others==

*Princess Elaine (&quot;Elainne&quot;), daughter of King Nentres and Queen Elaine (&quot;Didot-Perceval&quot; casts her as a child of King Lot named &quot;Aleine&quot;). She is a niece of King Arthur and either a sister or cousin of Gawain who falls in love with Perceval. Possibly the same as Elaine the Peerless.
*Princess Elaine (&quot;Eleine&quot;), daughter of King Pellinore in &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. She kills herself after the death of her lover Sir Miles of the Laundes. Some modern works such as &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; combine or conflate her with Elaine of Corbenic, due to their shared name and the similarity of their fathers&#x27; names.
*Princess Elaine, daughter of King Brandegore and mother of Sir Elyan in a variant of &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;. Usually named Claire in other texts.
*Elaine, an alternative name of Viviane, the Lady of the Lake in the Sommer version of the Vulgate Cycle. Mike Ashley identified her with Arthur&#x27;s sister Elaine.

<text>The private brewery Heinrich Reissdorf GmbH &amp; Co. KG was founded in 1894 by Heinrich Reissdorf in Cologne. It produces a top fermented beer called Reissdorf Kölsch.

Since 1968, the brewery in Cologne has been advertising on Aachener Straße with a moving neon sign in which a male lifts a glass of Kölsch to his mouth at a 90-degree angle. As the glass is emptied, the man&#x27;s body fills with Kölsch, represented by neon lights lighting up from bottom to top. The advertisement alternately depicts a male and a female person. As a landmark of Cologne, this is now a listed building.

<doc id="611335" wikidata="Q5182050" url="?curid=611335" title="Crane School of Music">
<text>The Crane School of Music is located in Potsdam, New York, and is one of three schools which make up the State University of New York (SUNY) at Potsdam.

Crane consists of approximately 630 undergraduate and 30 graduate students and a faculty of 70 teachers and professional staff in a college of 2500 students and 250 faculty. Crane is housed in the Julia E. Crane Music Center on the north side of the campus. The complex consists of four buildings: two classroom buildings (Bishop and Schuette Halls), three concert areas (the newly renovated Helen M. Hosmer Concert Hall, 1290 seats, the Sara M. Snell Music Theater, 452 seats, and the Ralph Wakefield Lecture and Recital Hall located within Bishop Hall, 130 seats) as well as extensive supporting areas. Located within Schuette Hall is the Crane Music Library, which includes an extensive collection of literature, scores, and recordings. Located within the music library is a MIDI Computer Lab. All four of Crane&#x27;s buildings are connected underground.

Crane became an All-Steinway School following the acquisition of 141 Steinway pianos beginning January 24, 2007. This $3.8 million purchase included three new concert grand pianos and was the largest purchase order that Steinway had ever received in the history of the company.

==History==
The Crane School was founded in 1886 by Julia Etta Crane (1855–1923) as the Crane Normal Institute of Music, and was one of the first institutions in the country to have programs dedicated to training public school music teachers.

The school suffered from financial difficulties and around 1920, Julia Crane unsuccessfully petitioned the Juilliard Foundation to purchase the school. In 1922, the State of New York also turned down an offer to buy, but in 1926, after Crane&#x27;s 1923 death, the State bought the school.

In addition to the permanent faculty, memorable performances by the Wind Ensemble and Symphony Orchestra have been given by such guest conductors as Franz Allers, Nadia Boulanger, Igor Buketoff, Sarah Caldwell, Stanley Chapple, Aaron Copland, Rodney Eichenberger, Alfred Gershfeld, Howard Hanson, Lukas Foss, Thor Johnson, Ann Howard Jones, Jan Meyerowitz, Charles O’Neill, Christof Perick, Eve Queler, Vincent Persichetti, Helmuth Rilling, Adnan Saygun, Gunther Schuller, Robert Shaw, Michael Tilson Thomas, Virgil Thomson.

Select Crane School students also have the opportunity to perform with professional ensembles in the North Country. Each year, The Northern Symphonic Winds and The Orchestra of Northern New York invite Crane students to play in their groups. Many Crane School faculty and alumni are full-time members of both NSW and ONNY.

==The Crane Symphony Orchestra==
The Crane Symphony Orchestra was formed in 1939, the second-earliest college orchestra in the country after Harvard. The permanent conductors have been Samuel Spurbeck, Maurice Baritaud, John L. Jadlos, Richard Stephan, Christopher Lanz, Ching-Chun Lai, and Adrian Slywotzky.

==The Crane Wind Ensemble==
The Crane Wind Ensemble comprises the most outstanding wind and percussion majors at The Crane School of Music. The CWE performs as a full wind band and also in smaller chamber groups with varied instrumentation. This group is dedicated to the performance of the finest wind repertoire, regardless of period or disposition of instrumental forces. The Crane band program is led by Dr. Brian K. Doyle, Director of Bands.

==Crane Chorus==
The Crane Chorus was founded in 1931 by Helen M. Hosmer. It is composed almost entirely of music majors at the Crane School of Music, and usually numbers between 185 and 200 singers. Principal conductors have included Helen M. Hosmer, Brock McElheran, Calvin Gage, Stanley Romanstein, Rick Bunting, Daniel Gordon, and Jeffrey Francom.

==Crane Opera Ensemble==
The Crane Opera Ensemble offers students performing opportunities in operatic and musical theatre productions. The ensemble began producing shows in 1924 and several recent productions have been the recipients of national awards.

Two fully staged productions are performed each year. The ensemble also hosts an opera education outreach program. The program brings in large groups of children from local schools to experience opera and engage in post-performance workshops with cast members and faculty. To date, over 4,000 children have participated in the program.

==Pellicciotti Opera Composition Prize==

Once every four years, the Domenic J. Pellicciotti Opera Composition Prize is awarded to a composer/librettist team developing an operatic work which explores and celebrates themes of tolerance, inclusion or diversity. Winning teams earn a commission and production award with the premiere of their work at the Crane School of Music. The prize was founded by Gary C. Jaquay to honor his life partner Domenic J. Pellicciotti, an ardent fan of opera.

The premiere of the first winners of the Pellicciotti Opera Composition Prize took place in November 2014, with the second cycle completed in November 2018 with the premiere of Tom Cipullo&#x27;s &quot;Mayo&quot;.

The following is a list of the winning works:

*&quot;Computing Venus&quot; (Timothy C. Takach, Libretto by Caitlin Vincent) 2023
*&quot;Mayo&quot; (Tom Cipullo), Nov. 2018
*&quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot; (Christopher Weiss, Libretto by S. O’Duinn Magee), Nov. 2014

*&quot;A Letter to East 11th Street&quot; (Martin Hennessey, Libretto by Mark Campbell), Nov. 2014

==Community Performance Series==
Crane has played home to the Community Performance Series (CPS) since 1989. CPS brings outside artists in to perform at Crane. Often a visiting artist will also conduct a master class during their time at the school. A pre-concert lecture is also given by a member of the faculty on the evening of the concert.

<text>Termination of employment or separation of employment is an employee&#x27;s departure from a job and the end of an employee&#x27;s duration with an employer. Termination may be voluntary on the employee&#x27;s part (resignation), or it may be at the hands of the employer, often in the form of dismissal (firing) or a layoff. Dismissal or firing is usually thought to be the employee&#x27;s fault, whereas a layoff is generally done for business reasons (for instance, a business slowdown or an economic downturn) outside the employee&#x27;s performance.

Firing carries a stigma in many cultures and may hinder the jobseeker&#x27;s chances of finding new employment, particularly if they have been terminated from a previous job. Jobseekers sometimes do not mention jobs from which they were fired on their resumes. Accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment, and refusal or failure to contact previous employers are often regarded as &quot;red flags&quot;.

==Dismissal==

Dismissal is when the employer chooses to require the employee to leave, usually for the reason that is the employee&#x27;s fault. The most common colloquial terms for dismissal in the United States are &quot;getting fired&quot; or &quot;getting canned&quot; whereas in the United Kingdom the terms &quot;getting the sack&quot; or &quot;getting sacked&quot; are also used.

==Layoff==

A less severe form of involuntary termination is often referred to as a layoff (also &quot;redundancy&quot; or &quot;being made redundant&quot; in British English). A &quot;layoff&quot; is usually not strictly related to personal performance but instead due to economic cycles or the company&#x27;s need to restructure itself, the firm itself going out of business, or a change in the function of the employer (for example, a certain type of product or service is no longer offered by the company, and therefore jobs related to that product or service are no longer needed). One type of layoff is the aggressive layoff; in such a situation, the employee is laid off but not replaced as the job is eliminated.

In an economy based on at-will employment, such as that of the United States, a large proportion of workers may be laid off at some time in their life, and often for reasons unrelated to performance or ethics. Employment termination can also result from a probational period, in which both the employee and the employer agree that the employer is allowed to lay off the employee if the probational period is not satisfied.

Often, layoffs occur as a result of &quot;downsizing&quot;, &quot;reduction in force&quot; or &quot;redundancy&quot;. These are not technically classified as firings; laid-off employees&#x27; positions are terminated and not refilled because either the company wishes to reduce its size or operations or lacks the economic stability to retain the position. In some cases, a laid-off employee may eventually be offered their old position again by their respective company, though by this time, they may have found a new job.

Some companies resort to &quot;attrition&quot; (&quot;voluntary redundancy&quot;) as a means to reduce their workforce. Under such a plan, no employees are forced to leave their jobs. However, those who do depart voluntarily are not replaced. Additionally, employees may resign in exchange for a fixed amount of money, frequently a few years of their salary. Such plans have been carried out by the United States Federal Government under President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, and by the Ford Motor Company in 2005.

However, &quot;layoff&quot; may be specifically addressed and defined differently in the contract articles in the case of unionised work.

== Terminating Employees for Economic - Related Reasons ==
Key policy issues associated with terminating employees for economic-related reasons across 190 countries from WorldBank Doing Business Data in the 2013-2017 period. (Most countries allow the termination of workers for economic reasons, but out of 190 countries, only Bolivia, Venezuela, Tonga, and Oman do not.)

=== Procedural requirements ===
ILO Termination of Employment Convention No. 158 requires if employers contemplate terminating a contract for economic reasons, they must promptly provide the employee representative with relevant information (termination reasons; number and  types of employees may be affected; expected termination period)

In 93/186 countries (50%), employers must inform a third party before ending a contract withone worker. The third-party differs in each country, such as the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (Afghanistan; Bahrain); the Chief Labor Administrator (Bhutan); the Labor Inspectorate (Chile); the recognized trade union or if it does not exist, employers notify Chief Labor Officer (Guyana); a labor officer and union (Kenya); the union representative and the public regional representative for employment (Morocco).

In 32/186 countries (17%), approval of termination from a third party is compulsory. For instance, approval from the Industrial Relations Dispute Settlement Board (Indonesia), the Conciliation and Arbitration Labor Board (Mexico), the Commissioner of Labor (Sri Lanka), and the Ministry of Labor (Suriname); only approval from the Works Council in case exceptional protected employee or Integration Office if disabled one or Labor Inspectorate if one on maternity/parental leave (Germany);  the General Labor Inspectorate or, in adding the labor ministry in case of collective dismissals (Angola).

Reforms of notification and approval procedures happened in five countries to make them more rigid:

=== Retraining and/or reassignment obligation ===
The ILO Recommendation No. 166 emphasizes employers’ obligation to retrain or reassign their workforce before terminating a redundant worker, and this provision is specified in labor law of many high income countries like Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Sweden; in case law of Netherlands; under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Australia); not obligation but employers in the United Kingdom does have to consider suitable alternative employment; in many developing countries and emerging market economies (ex. Kazakhstan; Pakistan; Sierra Leone; Vietnam).

=== Priority rules ===
According to ILO Recommendation No. 166, employers who select employees being terminated must comply with the criteria and order of priority specifically established in national laws or collective agreements.

For example, the groups are not layoff: “pregnant employees, female employees on maternity leave, male or female employees on maternity leave, single male or female employees taking care of their children under three years old or staff personally caring for relatives with severe disabilities; employees on leave, including annual leave, maternity leave, parental leave, sick leave, unpaid leave or other leave, or in other cases of absence for legitimate reasons. Elected union officials are also a traditionally protected group; their dismissal normally requires the consent of the higher union authority”.

in Botswana, Gambia, Kenya, Malta, Mexico, Nigeria, Panama, and Sierra Leone, employees with less seniority will be terminated first.

ILO Recommendation No. 166 2 prioritizes rehiring workers being terminated for economic reasons. In 2017, labour law imposed reemployment obligations in 69/186 countries (37), covering 31% of high-income and 63% of low-income countries. Priority provisions for rehiring dismissed employees are usually valid for 6 months (in Croatia, Gambia, the Netherlands, Serbia, Togo, and Turkey) to 12 months (in Cyprus with eight months; Djibouti, Lebanon, FYR Macedonia, and Peru within one year). Korea provides the lengthiest period of three years.

Reforms: between 2013 and 2017, 13 countries reformed rules of retraining, reassignment and priority. Most countries have liberalized some rules.

=== Notice period ===
Advance notice of future layoffs facilitates workers&#x27; job search. There are many exciting versions of the regulation of notice periods worldwide.

In 2017, 73 countries had a conditional length of notice period; 89 countries had a fixed period without regard to job tenure; 25 countries did not have like in Denmark, Greece, New Zealand, Uruguay, Guinea-Bissau, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Peru, and Serbia).

The most generous notice period is in Sweden (33 weeks), the Gambia and Luxembourg (26 weeks) for an employee with at least ten years of tenure.

Some countries set minimum job tenure for an employee to receive the notice (e.g. in Greece and Lesotho: there is no notice for novices in their first 12-month trial period; In Ireland, two week notice period for employees working 104 weeks continuously. 

Some countries differentiate the notice period based on professional criteria (ex. In Lao PDR 30 days for manual workers, 45 days for skilled workers; In Austria, two weeks for blue-collar workers, white-collar workers have different notice periods depending on their different tenure; the same in Madagascar, the notice period varies for laborers as it also depends on the length of employment and occupational group.

Some countries use social criteria to establish the advance notice period. For example, in Lithuania, two months is typical, but four months for an employee under 18 years old/ disabled/has full pension in less than five years/ raising children under 14 years old. In Croatia, the two-week notice is applied if the worker is over 50 years old, and one month for 55 years old.

As suggested by The ILO Termination of Employment Recommendation No. 166, an employee should be provided some days off to seek a new job during their notice period but still benefit from paid leave of absence. Poland is an example, and a worker has two or three days absent from work to find another job.

== Unfair Termination of Employment ==

=== General overview ===
Unfair termination of employment refers to the dismissal of an employee without a valid legal reason, usually not applicable in cases of redundancy, incompetence, or misconduct. According to Michael Salamon, author of Industrial Relations: Theory and Practice (2000), employers hold the legal authority to enforce workplace rules and expect employees to follow societal and job-related norms, avoiding from misconduct. However, some workplaces unjustly apply these rules, leading to excessive legal control over employees.

=== The Law of Unfair Termination ===
There is not a single worldwide legal framework that governs unfair termination across all countries. Employment laws, including those related to unfair termination, vary significantly from one country to another. Each country has its legal framework and regulations concerning employment relationships, which may include provisions about dismissal and termination.

For example, The Employment Rights Act 1996 (ERA 1996) is the United Kingdom (UK) employment legislation that governs the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees in the context of employment relationships within the UK. The ERA 1996 outlines various aspects of employment law, including unfair termination, redundancy, employment contracts, and minimum notice periods, among other matters. These regulations and protections apply to individuals working in the UK or to UK-based employers.

However, international labor standards and guidelines are set forth by organizations such as ILO, known as &quot;ILO Convention No. 158 - Termination of Employment Convention, 1982.&quot; These international standards provide overarching principles and recommendations for labor rights and practices but do not constitute binding laws for individual countries.

=== The example of unfair termination: Tanzania ===
In Tanzania, around 700 ex-mineworkers from the Bulyanhulu underground gold mining site won an unfair dismissal case in July 2010. They were terminated because of participating in a strike in 2007 following failed wage negotiations. The mine temporarily halted production and fired 1,300 striking employees, claiming they had left illegally. Some were rehired, while others sought legal assistance.

Another example of unfair termination in Tanzania involved the Sun Flag Textile Factory. The company employs 2,100 workers who work 24/7. In February 2008, around 350 workers were unfairly terminated for protesting lower wages from the factory, against government recommendations. Subsequently, about a hundred workers were reemployed at different production sites.

== Terminating in a safe, legal, and humane manner ==
An inadequately handled termination of employment can lead to legal conflicts or accusations of wrongful termination. Some experts suggest organizations should have a well-defined termination policy and a direct and brief termination meeting to minimize undesired outcomes, such as departing employees displaying aggression and causing disturbances within workgroups. Most employees anticipate receiving the reason for their termination, although it is usually not mandated by law. Therefore, managers must communicate the rationale of the termination to the employee without repeating prior issues, using clichés, or trying to present termination in a favorable light that can offend.

There are four effective and efficient steps for terminating employee in a safe, legal, and humane manner:

# Pre-termination decision-making:
#* Document the reasons for termination promptly: Create a memo or report detailing the decision rationale and attaching relevant documents like performance reviews, witness statements, and disciplinary notices. This record is not shared with the employee but ensures a credible, comprehensive, and immediate account of the termination&#x27;s grounds for potential legal use.
#* Investigate before terminating: Employers should diligently investigate potential job separations. Engage with all parties involved impartially and document their accounts
#* Consider alternatives (e.g., performance improvement plans, gradual disciplinary measures, final chance arrangements, voluntary resignations).
#* Subject the decision to scrutiny by higher-level management and/or HR professionals.
#* Contemplate the possibility of extending a severance package in return for a release of liability.
# Preparing the termination meeting or exit interview:
#* Schedule the meeting: While there is some debate in the literature, many experts recommend scheduling terminations for early in the day and early in the week.
#* Coordinate with the IT department to deactivate network access at the time of the termination.
#* Prepare a meeting place by booking a room that private and separated from other employees.
# Conducting the meeting:
#* Keep the meeting duration in 15 minutes or less.
#* Using clear and straightforward language, such as &quot;We have decided to terminate your employment, and today will be your final day&quot; Is recommended. Formulating the statement in the past tense helps to prevent disputes, negotiations, or requests for reconsideration.
#* Articulate the termination reason in concise and using general terms, refraining from delving into specifics or revisiting past issues that could lead in potential termination-related disputes.
#* Avoid debate: If the employee did not accept the reason of termination, it is advisable to decline further discussion during the meeting to avoid debate but offer solution by scheduling other discussion.
#* Demonstrate comfort with emotional expressions but avoid excessive responses and using clichés.
# Finalizing the process:
#* Offer a concise explanation of post-termination compensation and available services (e.g., continued benefits, severance pay, job placement assistance).
#* Retrieve company assets (e.g., keys, laptops, corporate credit cards) from the departing employee.
#* Maintain discretion regarding the specifics of the termination meeting.

==Termination by mutual agreement==
Some terminations result from a mutual agreement between the employer and the employee. When this happens, it is sometimes debatable if the termination was indeed mutual. In many of these cases, it was initially the employer&#x27;s wish for the employee to depart, but the employer offered the mutual termination agreement to soften the firing (as in a &quot;forced resignation&quot;). But there are also times when a termination date is agreed upon before the employment starts (as in an employment contract).

Some types of termination by the mutual agreement include:
*The end of an employment contract for a specified period (such as an internship)
*Mandatory retirement. Some occupations, such as commercial airline pilots, face mandatory retirement at a certain age.
*Forced resignation

===Changes of conditions===
Firms that wish for an employee to exit of their own accord but do not wish to pursue firing or forced resignation may degrade the employee&#x27;s working conditions, hoping that they will leave &quot;voluntarily&quot;.

The employee may be moved to a different geographical location, assigned to an undesirable shift, given too few hours if part-time, demoted (or relegated to a menial task), or assigned to work in uncomfortable conditions. Other forms of manipulation may be used, such as being unfairly hostile to the employee and punishing them for things other employees deliberately overlook.

Often, these tactics are done so the employer will not have to fill out termination papers in jurisdictions without at-will employment. In addition, with a few exceptions, employees who voluntarily leave generally cannot collect unemployment benefits.

Such tactics may amount to constructive dismissal, which is illegal in some jurisdictions.

== Pink slip ==
Pink slip refers to the American practice, by a human resources department, of including a discharge notice in an employee&#x27;s pay envelope to notify the worker of their involuntary termination of employment or layoff.

The &quot;pink slip&quot; has become a metonym for the termination of employment in general. According to an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the editors of the &quot;Random House Dictionary&quot; have dated the term to at least as early as 1910.

The phrase may have originated in vaudeville. When the United Booking Office (established in 1906) would issue a cancellation notice to an act, the notice was on a pink slip. Another possible etymology is that many applications (including termination papers) are done in triplicate form, with each copy on a different color of paper, one of which is typically pink.

In the UK and, until 1 January 2019 in Ireland, the equivalent of a pink slip is a P45; in Belgium the equivalent is known as a C4.
==Rehire following termination==
In certain situations, an individual who has been terminated or left from their job may have the opportunity to be reemployed by the same employer. In some cases, when an employee departs on good terms, such as pursuing a specific career goal, going to graduate school or pregnancy, they might be given special priority by the employer when seeking to rehire. Conversely, an employer is not likely to rehire a former employee who was terminated for cause, for example as a result of workplace violation, discriminatory, misconduct, insubordination, and ethics violations.

&quot;Boomerang&quot; is the term for workers who depart from an organization but are subsequently rehired by the same organization. Reemployment could be a good option because boomerangs tend to have longer tenure and lower absenteeism rates than other recruitment sources. Breaugh (2008) added that rehiring former employees, categorized as &quot;targeted recruitment&quot;, usually produces candidates with a higher likelihood of receiving and accepting job offers, better job performance, and longer organizational retention compared to candidates from &quot;untargeted recruitment&quot;. In terms of loyalty, boomerangs may have better loyalty as they voluntarily choose to return, having experience with their former and subsequent employers and making an informed decision to return.

There are three main types of employee rehiring; rehiring retirees, rehiring female employees who left voluntarily due to having children or caring for other family members, and rehiring as a natural outcome of the evolving concept of multi-faceted careers.

A notable example of a successful &quot;rehire following termination&quot; is Steve Jobs, a co-founded Apple Computers Inc. He initially left the company after being removed as CEO, spending eleven years building successful ventures outside of Apple. He returned to Apple in 1996 when the company was facing financial challenges. His comeback is considered one of the top ten most successful corporate turnarounds, leading to the introduction of innovative products and profitability.

== Final pay after Termination - Practices in New Zealand ==
=== 1. Definition ===
Final pay, which is also refers to termination pay, is a financial package provided by employers to employees when their employment is terminated under specific circumstances.

=== 2. When to pay ===
If an employee terminates on notice, their final pay should be given on the agree-upon pay day mentioned in their employment contract. If there is no agreed date, the final pay should be available after the last working day.

If the employer and employee mutually decide to end the employment immediately with a payment in lieu notice, they can set a different date for the final pay. However, it is advisable for this payment to align with the actual last day of employment.

If an employee does not receive all the components of their final pay which are owing, they may have a claim for unpaid wages or holiday pay or other breach of their employment agreement.

=== 3. Purpose of Final pay ===
In general, final pay package is typical meant to pay employees for any remaining wages and benefits happen since the last pay day to their last working day. It serves to provide financial support to employees during the transition period, ensure compliance with legal requirements, and in some cases, protect both parties from potential legal disputes.

=== 4. Components of Final pay ===
Final pay packages usually come in a lump sum and consist of various components based on company policies and employment agreements, but typically must include:

4.1  Wages and salary for all the hours worked since the last pay until the last working day of employment. 

4.2  Any leave entitlements owed to employee, including:

* Unused annual holidays, which is calculated at the rate of the greater of whichever is higher: the regular weekly pays or average weekly earnings. Additionally, the employee is also entitled to receive 8% of their total earnings since their last anniversary date for annual holidays (which may include payments for annual holidays, public holidays, and alternative holidays).

* Public holidays (when applicable). Public holidays will be paid if it falls within the duration created by adding their remaining annual holidays to the end of their employment and occurs on a day that aligns with their regular work schedule if they were still employed, and that day was not public holiday. If the employee qualifies for payment on a public holiday, then the duration covered by annual holidays is prolonged by one day for each eligible public holiday. This extended period may include additional public holidays that should also be considered for compensation.
* Accrued but unused alternative holidays of their prior work on public holidays. Alternative holidays do not affect the termination date and are not treated as calculation pay for public holidays as aforementioned.

4.3  Non-reimbursed expenses or allowance from employee’s work travel or working overtime before end of employment.

4.4  Any deductions or forfeiture related to financial loss or damage that employer had to suffer due to employee’s failure to fulfill their duty. Deductions or forfeiture from employee’s final pay require written consent or a specific clause in the employment agreement. Employers should notice employee beforehand about any deductions or forfeiture if applicable.

4.5  Any other allowances, bonuses that stated in the employment agreement.

Final pay package may or may not include:

4.6  Sick leave and bereavement leave: There is no legal requirement to provide payment for unused sick or bereavement leave when an employee leaves their job. It is on hand of employer to pay entirety, a portion or not to pay.

4.7  Severance pay: is a special allowance/bonus, which is offered to terminated employees in special contexts, such as redundancy, downsizing, or lay off. Severance pay is not mandatory; however, employers usually offer severance package as a gesture of goodwill and competitive advantage. Severance pay is paid, if any, based on employee’s years of service and contribution to the company. It may also include continuation of benefits and other perks (health insurance, outplacement assistant, etc.).

The primary purpose of severance pay is to provide financial support to employees during the transition period following their termination. It helps employees bridge the gap until they secure new employment and helps employers comply with employment laws and regulations and to mitigate potential legal disputes and claims.

In some special situations, employers and employees may decide to end the employment relationship through mutual agreement as a best solution to resolve their differences. In this case, severance pay is understood as an exchange for the employee giving up the right to take legal actions against the employer. This financial settlement is referred to as “exit packages” or “golden handshakes” and is legalized in a “record of settlement” signed by both parties and endorsed by a mediator. It helps ensuring a smooth transition while protecting the interests of both parties.

Death is also considered as a special type of termination and should be also entitled to severance package. It is provided to family or beneficiaries of employee who passed away while employed to help them overcome the difficult time of losing the breadwinner.

<text>:&quot;Star&#x27;s End is also a 1974 album by British composer David Bedford and a 1982 novel by Glen Cook.&quot;
Star&#x27;s End is a weekly, five-hour-long new-age music radio show broadcast by 88.5 WXPN, the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s radio station, in Philadelphia. It is the second longest-running show of its type in the world, after &quot;Hearts of Space&quot;.

==History==

&quot;Star&#x27;s End&quot; was started in 1976 by Steve Pross and John Diliberto as a five-hour-long evening program. Diliberto later went on to host the syndicated nightly ambient music show &quot;Echoes&quot;. In 1977 Gino Wong began sharing duties with Diliberto when Steve Pross entered the recording industry. At that point the concept was solidified and the opening theme that is still used today was produced. Gordon Danis (1957–2008) joined for a short time in 1978 bringing his passion for early ambient music to the mix. In 1979 Wong began producing records and concerts, creating an opening for guest hosts including Janet Quigley and Kimberly Haas. Beginning in the early 1980s Star&#x27;s End went through an extended rotation of several different DJs. Original programmers Diliberto left in 1986 and Wong in 1988. The current host is Chuck Van Zyl.

==Production details==

&quot;Star&#x27;s End&quot; is broadcast late Saturday nights / Sunday mornings from 1:00 AM through 6:00 AM. In the late 1980s an earlier edition was added on Friday nights from 11:00 PM to 2:00 AM. This &quot;matinee&quot; edition lasted for 3 or 4 years. The show features uninterrupted, hour-long segue-mixed music selections. The show&#x27;s website lists a variety of ambient genres and related styles as present in its playlist, including space music, new-age, electronic music, world music, avant-garde, classical and even spoken word performances. In the past, Star&#x27;s End has featured guest DJs mixing ambient music, and has also broadcast live in-studio performances by Robert Rich, Jonn Serrie, 302 Acid, Steve Roach, Radio Massacre International and others.

==Related projects==
In recent years Chuck van Zyl has organised a number of live concert performances in Philadelphia by various ambient artists, under the Star&#x27;s End banner. Known as &quot;The Gatherings&quot; series, performers have included Steve Roach, Robert Rich, Radio Massacre International, Jeff Greinke, Erik Wøllo and van Zyl&#x27;s own group, The Ministry of Inside Things along with numerous others. Several independent CD recordings of performances recorded at these concerts have subsequently been released by van Zyl under his Synkronos label.

<doc id="611345" wikidata="Q165448" url="?curid=611345" title="Drusus Caesar">
<text>Drusus Caesar ( AD 8 – 33) was the grandson by adoption and heir of the Roman emperor Tiberius, alongside his brother Nero. Born into the prominent Julio-Claudian dynasty, Drusus was the son of Tiberius&#x27; general and heir, Germanicus.

Sejanus, the prefect of the Praetorian Guard, had become powerful in Rome and is believed by ancient writers such as Suetonius and Tacitus to have been responsible for the downfall of Drusus the Younger. As Sejanus&#x27; power grew, other members of the imperial family began to fall as well. In AD 29, Tiberius wrote a letter to the Senate attacking Nero and his mother, and the Senate had them both exiled. Two years later, Nero died in exile on the island of Ponza. Drusus was later imprisoned following similar charges as his brother, and remained in prison from AD 30 until his death three years later. Their deaths allowed for the ascension of their third brother, Gaius Caligula, following the death of Tiberius in AD 37.

==Background and family==
Drusus was born in around AD 8 to Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder. Drusus&#x27; paternal grandparents were Nero Claudius Drusus (Drusus the Elder) and Antonia Minor, daughter of Mark Antony and Octavia Minor. His maternal grandparents were Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, a close friend of Augustus, and Augustus&#x27; daughter Julia the Elder. Drusus had eight siblings: four brothers (Tiberius and Gaius, who died young; Nero Julius Caesar; and another Gaius, nicknamed &quot;Caligula&quot;), three sisters (Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, and Julia Livilla), and a brother or sister of unknown name (normally referenced as &quot;Ignotus&quot;).

As a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, he was a close relative of all five Julio-Claudian emperors: his great-grandfather Augustus was the first emperor of the dynasty, his great-uncle Tiberius was the second emperor, his brother Gaius (Caligula) was the third emperor, his uncle Claudius was the fourth emperor, and his nephew Lucius Domitius (more commonly known as &quot;Nero&quot;) was the fifth and final emperor of the dynasty.
His father was the adopted son of Tiberius, who was himself the adoptive son of Augustus, whose adoptions were the result of the death of Gaius Caesar in February AD 4. Gaius, who was the heir of Augustus, had died of illness in Syria. Germanicus was for some time considered a potential heir by Augustus, but Augustus later decided in favor of his stepson Tiberius. As a result, in June AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on the condition that Tiberius first adopt Germanicus. As a corollary to the adoption, Germanicus was wed to his second cousin Agrippina the Elder the following year.

In AD 13, his father was appointed commander of the forces on the Rhine, from where he led three campaigns into Germany against the forces of Arminius, which had made him popular as he avenged the humiliating Roman defeat at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest. In October AD 14, Germanicus received a delegation from the Senate giving its condolences for the death of Augustus. Augustus had died in August and Tiberius became emperor, making Germanicus heir to the empire. 

At the direction of Tiberius, Germanicus was dispatched to Asia to reorganize the provinces and assert imperial authority there. The provinces were in such disarray that the attention of a member of the leading family was deemed necessary. However, after two years in the east, Germanicus came at odds with the governor of Syria, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso. During their feud, Germanicus fell ill and died in October AD 19.

Drusus married Aemilia Lepida around AD 29. She was the daughter of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, his second cousin. Tacitus reports that during their marriage &quot;she had pursued her husband with ceaseless accusations&quot;. In 36, she was charged with adultery with a slave and committed suicide, &quot;since there was no question about her guilt&quot;.

His mother Agrippina believed her husband was murdered to promote Drusus the Younger as heir, and feared that the birth of his twin sons would give him motive to displace her own sons. However, her fears were unfounded, with Nero being elevated by Tiberius in AD 20. Nero received the &quot;toga virilis&quot; (toga of manhood), was promised the office of quaestor five years in advance, and was wed to Drusus the Younger&#x27;s daughter Julia.

Following the death of Germanicus, Drusus the Younger was Tiberius&#x27; new heir. He received a second consulship in AD 21 and &quot;tribunicia potestas&quot; (tribunician power) in AD 22. At the same time, Praetorian prefect Sejanus now came to exert considerable influence over the emperor, who referred to Sejanus as &quot;socius laborum&quot; (&quot;my partner in my toils&quot;). According to Tacitus and Cassius Dio, the Younger Drusus and Sejanus began bickering and entered a feud during which Drusus became ill and died of seemingly natural causes on 14 September 23. Ancient sources say the cause of death was poison, whereas modern authors, such as Barbara Levick, suggest that it may have been due to illness.

==Career==

The death of the Younger Drusus left no immediate threat to Sejanus. Ultimately, his death elevated Drusus and Nero to the position of heirs. Drusus received the &quot;toga virilis&quot; and was promised the rank of quaestor five years before the legal age, just as his brother Nero had been given. In effect, this formed factions around them and their mother Agrippina on the one side and Sejanus on the other. It is impossible to know the full extent of Sejanus&#x27; power at this point, but it has been noted that Sejanus was not allowed to marry Livilla (Drusus the Younger&#x27;s widow) and was thus denied entry into the imperial family. In the Senate, Sejanus encountered little opposition from the senators, but Tiberius expressed displeasure in the Senate, in AD 24, at the public prayers which had been offered for Nero and his brother Drusus&#x27; health. 

In 28, the Senate voted that altars to &quot;Clementia&quot; (mercy) and &quot;Amicitia&quot; (friendship) be raised. At that time, &quot;Clementia&quot; was considered a virtue of the ruling class, for only the powerful could give clemency. The altar of &quot;Amicitia&quot; was flanked by statues of Sejanus and Tiberius. By this time his association with Tiberius was such that there were even those in Roman society who erected statues in his honor and gave prayers and sacrifices in his honor. Like members of the imperial family, Sejanus&#x27; birthday was to be honored. According to author and historian Alston, &quot;Sejanus&#x27; association with Tiberius must have at least indicated to the people that he would be further elevated.&quot;

===Downfall===
The very next year saw a direct attack on Agrippina and Nero: Tiberius sent a letter to the Senate in which he accused Agrippina and Nero of misconduct, but was unable to convict them of any attempt at rebellion; the attitude of the former and the sexual activity of the latter were the primary accusations against them. Agrippina was popular with the people, as was the family of Germanicus, and the people surrounded the senate-house carrying likenesses of the two in protest of the letter. The Senate refused to come to a resolution on the matter until it received plain direction from the emperor to do so. Tiberius found it necessary to repeat his charges, and when he did, the Senate no longer delayed; and the fate of Agrippina and Nero was sealed. Nero was declared an enemy of the state, removed to the island of Ponza, and was killed or encouraged to kill himself in 31.

After his wife Amelia betrayed him for Sejanus, Drusus was dismissed by Tiberius. It wasn&#x27;t long before he was accused by Cassius Severus of plotting against Tiberius. He was imprisoned and confined to a dungeon on the Palatine in 30. He starved to death in prison in 33 after having been reduced to chewing the stuffing of his bed.

==Postmortem==
Sejanus remained powerful until his sudden downfall and summary execution in October AD 31, just after the death of Nero, the exact reasons for this remain unclear. After realizing his error in trusting Sejanus, Tiberius considered releasing Drusus, but decided that he had been imprisoned for too long to be released. The Senate was shocked reading the account of his imprisonment from his diary.

The deaths of Germanicus&#x27; oldest sons elevated his third son, Gaius Caesar (Caligula), to successor and he became &quot;princeps&quot; when Tiberius died in AD 37. Drusus the Younger&#x27;s son Tiberius Gemellus was summoned to Capri by his grandfather Tiberius, where he and Gaius Caligula were made joint-heirs. When Caligula assumed power, he made Gemellus his adopted son, but Caligula soon had Gemellus killed for plotting against him.

<text>Caelia (or Celia) is a Fairy Queen in Richard Johnson&#x27;s romance &quot;Tom a Lincoln&quot;. Caelia is the ruler of an island called &quot;Fairy Land,&quot; populated by women who have slain their warmongering men. She begs Tom and his companions to stay on the island so that it might be re-peopled. She eventually bears Tom&#x27;s son, the Faerie Knight, but later commits suicide by drowning herself when she thinks that Tom has abandoned her.

She further appears in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; as the ruler of the House of Holiness where with the help of her three daughters she helps the Redcrosse Knight (the epic&#x27;s protagonist) regain his strength and holiness to complete his quest. Caelia is described in . Her name refers to the Heavenly Spirit. She resides in the House of Holiness, which serves as the direct opposite of the House of Pride that appears earlier in the book. She is the mother of Faith, Hope, and Charity, otherwise known as Fidelia, Speranza, and Charissa.

The band name was a pun of a pun; Bill Haley &amp; His Comets was a 1950s rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll band that derived its name as a pun of the typical mispronunciation of Halley&#x27;s Comet (properly pronounced as &quot;Hal-lee&quot;, rhymes with &quot;valley&quot;, but commonly mispronounced as &quot;Hay-lee&quot;), a comet which orbits the Sun near Earth about every 75 years. It also helped people pronounce Frehley&#x27;s name properly to connect it to the common mispronunciation of Halley as &quot;Hay-lee&quot;, as in &quot;Fray-lee&quot; vs. the common mispronunciation as &quot;Free-lee&quot;.

== History ==

Before forming a band for his post-KISS career, Frehley had previously done a solo album in 1978 which was the most successful of the Kiss solo albums, and laid the groundwork for his solo career. Frehley left Kiss in 1982, but retained a one-quarter share in Kiss and could not release any solo projects until 1985 without losing that share.

During this time Ace put together a band for his solo work, the original lineup consisted of Richie Scarlet on guitar, John Regan on bass, Regan&#x27;s Peter Frampton bandmate Arthur Stead on keyboards and former Kiss and Spider drummer Anton Fig. This band played live for the first time on November 30, 1984, and demoed 20 songs in various sessions with producers Eddie Kramer, Tony Bongiovi, Chris Kimsey and Vini Poncia.

In May 1985, Frehley&#x27;s friend from the Bronx, Rob Sabino, who also produced one of Scarlet&#x27;s solo albums in 1984, replaced Stead (who went on to join Public Enemy) on keyboards. British label Bronze Records reportedly offered the band a deal in the summer of 1985 but withdrew it due to Frehley&#x27;s &quot;unreliability&quot;, before ultimately folding in early 1986.

In November 1986 Frehley signed a six-album deal with Megaforce Records. Sabino and Regan had left the band at that point but Regan returned from touring with John Waite and Patti Smith after the recording deal was signed. In December 1986, before they made their initial record, with producer Eddie Kramer, Scarlet was replaced by former Cheap Trick member Tod Howarth who played guitar and keyboards.

&quot;Frehley&#x27;s Comet&quot; was supposed to simply be the title of Frehley&#x27;s next solo album, but Frehley decided to use that as the name of the band rather than release the record as a solo artist. Fig did not tour for the album and was replaced by Billy Ward as touring drummer. Before the second album, &quot;Second Sighting&quot;, Ward was replaced on drums by veteran Eric Clapton Band member Jamie Oldaker who played his first show with the band on September 22, 1987, and also did the entire tour for the 2nd album.

Two studio albums and one live album were released under the &quot;Frehley&#x27;s Comet&quot; moniker (The live album, &quot;Live+1&quot; featured four songs performed live in concert and one original studio song). The last show under the Frehley&#x27;s Comet name was in August 1988, opening for Iron Maiden, and Howarth and Oldaker left before the end of the year.

In 1989, for &quot;Trouble Walkin&#x27;, &quot; his third studio release (produced by Eddie Kramer), Frehley dropped the Frehley&#x27;s Comet name and put out a pure &quot;Ace Frehley&quot; solo album. Tod Howarth was replaced by a returning Richie Scarlet, and Jamie Oldaker by ex-Riot drummer Sandy Slavin (although Anton Fig and ex-Kiss Drummer Peter Criss did perform some of the percussion work on the album). According to Frehley, He offered then KISS drummer Eric Carr a chance to be on a song. However, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons dissuaded Carr from doing so. The album featured numerous guest vocalists including Criss and Sebastian Bach. The tour ended and the band dissolved after John Regan resigned with immediate effect after a show in Las Vegas on April 11, 1990. Frehley did not perform live in any form for two years after that, until July 1992.

Frehley put his solo career on hold to rejoin Kiss in 1996. He has since resumed his solo career with Richie Scarlet back in his touring band. After touring Australia together with Gene Simmons and his solo band in 2018, Frehley fired his entire solo band including Scarlet with whom he had played on and off since 1984 and replaced them with Simmons&#x27;s backing band.

In 2014, Regan and Howarth reunited in the band Four By Fate. The band played various one-off reunion shows in 2017 and 2018 with Frehley, Tod Howarth, John Regan, and Anton Fig together.

<doc id="611354" wikidata="Q13479577" url="?curid=611354" title="Temenggong">
<text>Temenggong or Tumenggung (Jawi: تمڠݢوڠ; &quot;Temenggung&quot;, Hanacaraka: ꦠꦸꦩꦼꦁ​ꦒꦸꦁ​; &quot;Tumenggung&quot;) is an old Malay and Javanese title of nobility, usually given to the chief of public security.

==Responsibilities==
The Temenggong is usually responsible for the safety of the monarch (raja or sultan), as well as overseeing the state police and army. A temenggong may also be assigned by its sovereign as a ruler in frontier regions, acting as either a regent or a viceroy with additional development &amp; military responsibility (comparable to European Marquess).

==Johor==
In the Sultanate of Johor, the Temenggong of Muar held a fief centered in Segamat for approximately two centuries and the Temenggong of Johor was the head of the fief (Johor mainland) between 1760 and 1868. The full rendition of the Johor Temenggong was &quot;Temenggung Seri Maharaja&quot;. Although the Temenggong was the head of the fief&#x27;s administration, the Temenggong held the Johor Sultanate by virtue of his being a vassal of the Sultan. In 1868, Temenggong Abu Bakar declared himself as a maharaja, assumed control over Muar and declared himself an independent ruler. In 1885, he assumed the title of Sultan with the blessing of Britain.

== Majapahit ==
Negarakretagama cantos 10 describe that the mayor visited the Kepatihan Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister building) led by Gajah Mada in order to report the administrative activities in the area. Majapahit government administration had five authoritative leaders called Sang Panca Ri is capability they were 
* Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister) / the Prime Minister who supervised Rakryan Tumenggung (commander), Rakryan Rangga (commander assistant), Rakryan Kanuruhan (communicator) and Rakryan Demung (regulator the royal household). He ruled as the regulator of the government implementation in all regions of Majapahit, and therefore Sang Panca Ri Wilwatikta was visited by the State authorities and local subordinates for government affairs.
* From the Prime Minister, commands down to wedana (the district officer), the district head.
* From wedana down to akuwu, the head of a group of village. 
* From akuwu down to buyut, village elders. 
* From buyut down to the villagers

==Mataram Sultanate==
During the era of Mataram Sultanate, temenggongs were directly appointed by sultan and act as a regional leader in regions not directly administrated by the court (mostly in coastal regions). They were responsible for raising and commanding their own regional army, which could be assigned in a military expedition supervised by the sultan himself. One of the most renowned temenggong in Mataram was Bahureksa, the regent of Kendal. He was executed by Sultan Agung due to his failure while leading the Mataram army during the unsuccessful Siege of Batavia in 1628.

<doc id="611355" wikidata="Q7869595" url="?curid=611355" title="USS Gearing">
<text>USS &quot;Gearing&quot; (DD-710) was the lead ship of her class of destroyers in the United States Navy. She was named for three generations of the Gearing family, Commander Henry Chalfant Gearing Sr., Captain Henry Chalfant Gearing Jr. and Lieutenant Henry Chalfant Gearing, III.

==Construction==

&quot;Gearing&quot; was launched on 18 February 1945 by the Federal Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., Kearny, New Jersey. &quot;Gearing&quot; was sponsored by Mrs. Thomas M. Foley, daughter of Commander Gearing and commissioned 3 May 1945.

==History==

After shakedown off Cuba, &quot;Gearing&quot; reached Norfolk 22 July 1945 and trained precommissioning crews for other destroyers until putting in at Casco Bay, Maine, 5 October. &quot;Gearing&quot; put in at Pensacola, Florida, 4 November to screen the aircraft carrier during carrier qualification operations.

Returning to Norfolk 21 March 1946, she conducted peacetime operations along the Atlantic coast of North and South America, in the Caribbean, visiting Montevideo, Uruguay; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. &quot;Gearing&quot; sailed 10 November 1947 on her first Mediterranean cruise, calling at Algeria, Malta, Italy, and France before mooring again at Norfolk 11 March 1948.

Peacetime operations along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean prepared her for a second cruise to European waters; the destroyer visited most of the nations washed by the Mediterranean from 10 November 1947 to 11 March 1948 and duplicated this long voyage from 4 January to 23 May 1949.

During the fall of 1949 &quot;Gearing&quot; took part in Operation Frostbite, an Arctic cruise test and development of cold weather techniques and equipment. She continued operations off the east coast of the United States and in the Caribbean through 1950. Another voyage from 10 January to 17 May 1951 brought her from Norfolk to the Mediterranean and return; the remainder of the year was occupied by training cruises as far north as Halifax and south to Cuban waters.

By now &quot;Gearing&quot; had established the pattern of peacetime operations she followed well into the 1960s: &quot;Med&quot; cruises usually once a year, and exercise in the Atlantic and Caribbean. These kept her in fighting trim for the ceaseless duties of seapower. She also took part in negotiations during the &quot;Santa Maria&quot; hijacking, and was modernized and overhauled late 1961 through early 1962 at Boston.

In October 1962 &quot;Gearing&quot; took part in the American naval blockade of Cuba in response to Cuban Missile Crisis, the basing of Soviet ballistic missiles on that island, and was the first to intercept a Soviet vessel. After diplomatic negotiations ended this crisis, &quot;Gearing&quot; returned to Norfolk on 1 November 1962. Through the remainder of 1962 she continued operations in the Atlantic.

After participating in Operation &quot;Springboard-63&quot; early in 1963, &quot;Gearing&quot; sailed for the Mediterranean in March serving with the 6th Fleet during the summer. She returned to Newport in September for a &quot;FRAM I&quot; overhaul. Following operations in the Caribbean and North Atlantic in the spring and summer of 1964, &quot;Gearing&quot; entered the Mediterranean on 4 October to rejoin the 6th Fleet. After returning home early in 1965, she continued operating in the Atlantic Fleet into 1967.

She was decommissioned in 1973, stricken on 1 July 1973 and sold for scrap on 6 November 1974.

<text>Marcus Livius Drusus (155–108 BC) was a Roman politician who served as consul in 112 BC. He was also governor of Macedonia and campaigned successfully in Thrace against the Scordisci.

== Early life ==
Drusus was a son of Gaius Livius Drusus. He had a brother named Gaius Livius Drusus and a sister named Livia.

== Tribunate ==
Drusus was set up as tribune of the plebs by the Senate in 122 BC to undermine Gaius Gracchus&#x27; land reform bills. To do this (according to the record of Appian), he proposed creating twelve colonies with 3,000 settlers each from the poorer classes, and relieving rent on property distributed since 133 BC. He also said the Latin allies should not be mistreated by Roman generals, which was the counteroffer to Gracchus&#x27; offer of full citizenship. These were known as the &quot;Leges Liviae&quot;, but they were never enacted, because the Senate simply wanted to draw support away from Gracchus.

Their plan was successful. Drusus had just enough popular support to justify his veto of Gracchus&#x27; bills.

== Consulship and later career ==
Drusus was later consul in 112 BC and fought in Macedonia defeating the Scordisci, even pushing them out of Thrace across the Danube.

In 109 BC he was elected censor along with the elder Marcus Aemilius Scaurus. He died in office.

== Family ==
Drusus was married to a Cornelia, they had three known children:
* Marcus Livius Drusus, the famous tribune of 91 BC, whose murder incited the Italian Social War.
* Mamercus Aemilius Lepidus Livianus, the consul of 77 BC (adopted into the Aemilii Lepidi), who married the daughter of Sulla the dictator.
* Livia, the mother of Servilia and Cato the Younger.

<doc id="611361" wikidata="Q2375101" url="?curid=611361" title="Lenin's Testament">
<text>Lenin&#x27;s Testament is a document dictated by Vladimir Lenin in late 1922 and early 1923. In the testament, Lenin proposed changes to the structure of the Soviet governing bodies. Sensing his impending death, he also criticised Bolshevik leaders Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotsky, Bukharin, Pyatakov, and Stalin. He warned of the possibility of a split developing in the party leadership between Trotsky and Stalin if proper measures were not taken to prevent it. In a post-script of dubious origin, it is also suggested Joseph Stalin be removed from his position as General Secretary of the Russian Communist Party&#x27;s Central Committee. Although there are some historical questions regarding the document&#x27;s origins, the majority view is that the document was authored by Lenin.

==Background==

Lenin was seriously ill by the latter half of 1921, experiencing hyperacusis, insomnia, and regular headaches. At the Politburo&#x27;s insistence, in July he left Moscow for a month&#x27;s leave at his Gorki mansion, where he was cared for by his wife and sister. Lenin began to contemplate the possibility of suicide, asking both Krupskaya and Stalin to acquire potassium cyanide for him. Twenty-six physicians were hired to help Lenin during his final years; many of them were foreign and had been hired at great expense. Some suggested that his sickness could have been caused by metal oxidation from the bullets that were lodged in his body from the 1918 assassination attempt; in April 1922 he underwent a surgical operation to remove them. The symptoms continued after this, with Lenin&#x27;s doctors unsure of the cause; some suggested that he had neurasthenia or cerebral arteriosclerosis. In May 1922, he had his first stroke, temporarily losing his ability to speak and being paralysed on his right side. He convalesced at Gorki, and had largely recovered by July. In October, he returned to Moscow; in December, he had a second stroke and returned to Gorki.

In Lenin&#x27;s absence, Stalin had begun consolidating his power both by appointing his supporters to prominent positions, and by cultivating an image of himself as Lenin&#x27;s closest intimate and deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin&#x27;s regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who had access to him.

Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should retain its monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing his annoyance.

Lenin also threatened to break relations with Stalin in a letter, written in March 1923, after learning of his rudeness towards his wife. Lenin had also expressed strong criticism of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of the Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Inspection which had been overseen by Stalin from 1920 until 1922. He stated: &quot;Everybody knows that no other institutions are worse organised than those of our Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, and that under present conditions nothing can be expected from this People&#x27;s Commissariat&quot;. Trotsky had also attempted to publish Lenin&#x27;s criticisms of the Rabkrin for several weeks but the Politburo, under the control of the triumvirate, refused.

Conversely, Lenin expressed hostility to the initial attempts by the triumvirate to remove Trotsky from the leadership. In a 1922 memo written to Kamenev, he chastised the efforts by the Central Committee to &quot;throw Trotsky overboard&quot; as the &quot;height of stupidity. If you do not consider me already hopelessly foolish, how can you think of that?&quot;.

Various historians have cited Lenin&#x27;s proposal to appoint Trotsky as a Vice-chairman of Soviet of People&#x27;s Comissaries of the Soviet Union as evidence that he intended Trotsky to be his successor as head of government. He had been expected to assume responsibility over the Council of National Economy or Gosplan. Prior to the introduction of the factional ban in 1921, due to intra-party controversies and the wider conflict of the Civil War, Trotsky had a considerable following among the party activists and members of the Central Committee against the narrow majority supporting Lenin. His supporters also controlled the newly established Orgburo and the Party Secretariat before the appointment of Stalin as General Secretary. According to historian Sheila Fitzpatrick, Trotsky would have been the likely successor to Lenin had he assumed the position of first deputy at Sovnarkom and this position would have given him an institutional base against Stalin&#x27;s base in the party.

In 1922, Lenin allied with Leon Trotsky against the party&#x27;s growing bureaucratisation and the influence of Joseph Stalin. All evidence suggests that Lenin spent the winter of 1923 preparing to launch an attack on Stalin during the Twelfth Party Congress and had approached Trotsky to take on responsibility for the Georgian Affair. Lenin had also encouraged Trotsky in his absence to challenge Stalin at the Twelfth Party Congress over his methods in managing Georgian Bolsheviks.

During December 1922 and January 1923, Lenin dictated &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Testament&quot;, in which he discussed the personal qualities of his comrades, particularly Trotsky and Stalin. An early, typed version of the testament, which was based on the shorthand notes, was burned by Lenin&#x27;s secretary, Mariya Volodicheva on the orders of Stalin. However, four other copies of the testament were stored in a safe.

==Document history and authenticity==
Lenin wanted the testament to be read out at the 12th Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to be held in April 1923. The document was originally dictated to Lenin&#x27;s personal secretary, Lydia Fotiyeva. However, after Lenin&#x27;s third stroke in March 1923 that left him paralyzed and unable to speak, the testament was kept secret by his wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya, in the hope of Lenin&#x27;s eventual recovery. She possessed four copies while Maria Ulyanova, Lenin&#x27;s sister, had one. It was only after Lenin&#x27;s death, on January 21, 1924, that she turned the document over to the Communist Party Central Committee Secretariat and asked for it to be made available to the delegates of the 13th Party Congress in May 1924.

An edited version of the testament was printed in December 1927 in a limited edition made available to 15th Party Congress delegates. The case for making the testament more widely available was undermined by the consensus within the party leadership that it could not be printed publicly as it would damage the party as a whole.

The text of the testament and the fact of its concealment soon became known in the West, especially after the circumstances surrounding the controversy were described by Max Eastman in &quot;Since Lenin Died&quot; (1925). The full English text of Lenin&#x27;s testament was published as part of an article by Eastman that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1926. In response to Eastman&#x27;s article, Trotsky described the claim that the Central Committee concealed the testament as &quot;pure slander&quot;. Trotsky also rejected the characterization of the document as a &quot;will&quot;, describing the document as one of Lenin&#x27;s letters providing advice on organizational matters. Trotsky would later explain his decision during the Dewey Commission hearing in 1937, in which he stated that Eastman had made the publication without his consent and pressure from the majority of the Politburo members had led him to disavow Eastman&#x27;s publication.

Historian Stephen Kotkin argued that the evidence for Lenin&#x27;s authorship of the Testament is weak and suggested that the Testament could have been created by Krupskaya. However, the Testament has been accepted as genuine by other historians, including E. H. Carr, Isaac Deutscher, Dmitri Volkogonov, Vadim Rogovin and Oleg Khlevniuk, and Kotkin&#x27;s argument was specifically rejected by Richard Pipes. Moshe Lewin cited the document as a representation of Lenin&#x27;s views and argued that “the Soviet regime underwent a long period of “Stalinism”, which in its basic features was diametrically opposed to the recommendations of the testament”.

Historian Ronald Suny wrote that Kotkin&#x27;s hypothesis lacked mainstream support in a review: &quot;Few other scholars doubt the authorship of the document, which accurately reflected Lenin’s views, nor was it questioned at the time it was written and debated in high party circles. Kotkin’s interpretation, fascinating as it is, relies on conjecture rather than evidence&quot;.

A number of modern Russian historians, most notably Valentin Sakharov author of the book “Political testament” of V. I. Lenin&quot; express doubts about the authorship of Lenin, affirming that Krupskaya or even Leon Trotsky could be the true author of the letter, a view which is shared by historians Vladimir Ermakov and Yuri Zhukov.

Conversely, historian Mark Edele was critical of this hypothesis and argued that Kotkin &quot;went as far as embracing the empirically shaky thesis that Lenin’s &#x27;Testament&#x27; was a forgery. As one of his critics pointed out, this discredited position is otherwise embraced only by Russian neo-Stalinists&quot;.

Historian Hiroaki Kuromiya has attributed claims of a forgery to Russian historian Valentin Sakharov who argued that Lenin&#x27;s entourage had forged some of the documents to discredit Stalin. However, Kuromiya stated that Sakharov&#x27;s claim had &quot;generated much controversy and little consensus&quot;.

Historian Peter Kenez believed that Trotsky could probably have removed Stalin with the use of Lenin&#x27;s testament but he acquiesced to the collective decision not to publish the document.

Historian Geoffrey Roberts stated that none of the Soviet figures questioned the authenticity of the document at the time. He noted that Stalin himself quoted the full passage of the testament and commented that &quot;Indeed I am rude, Comrades, to those who rudely and perfidiously destroy and split the party. I have not hidden this, and still do not&quot;. Similarly, historian Roman Brackman stated that Krupskaya circulated copies of Lenin&#x27;s testament to all the Politburo members and noted that Stalin upon reading the Lenin&#x27;s testament had &quot;exploded with obscene swearing at Lenin in the presence of Kamenev and Zinoviev&quot;. Historian Vadim Rogovin cited a letter written by Grigori Zinoviev between July and August 1923 which referenced Lenin&#x27;s characterization of Stalin in the testament as &quot;a thousand times correct&quot;. Rogovin also cited a published correspondence from Zinoviev and Bukharin which was addressed to Stalin and stated, &quot;there exists a letter by V.I., in which he advised (the Twelfth Party Congress) not to elect you Secretary&quot;. According to Stalin&#x27;s secretary, Boris Bazhanov, Lenin &quot;in general leaned towards a collegial leadership, with Trotsky in the first position&quot;. Old Bolshevik and historian, Vladimir Nevsky, believed that Stalin was appointed the General Secretary because he used false rumors to convince Lenin that the party faced a split. Nevsky also claimed that Lenin would later deeply regret trusting Stalin and strove to correct this mistake with his &quot;Testament&quot;. According to Kuromiya, Stalin pleaded with the People&#x27;s Commissar for Finance, Grigory Sokolnikov, not to discuss Lenin&#x27;s testament at the 15th party Congress.

===Related documents===
This term is not to be confused with &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Political Testament&quot;, a term used in Leninism to refer to a set of letters and articles dictated by Lenin during his illness on how to continue the construction of the Soviet state. Traditionally, it includes the following works:
*&quot;A Letter to a Congress&quot;, &quot;Письмо к съезду&quot;
*&quot;About Assigning of Legislative Functions to Gosplan&quot;, &quot;О придании законодательных функций Госплану&quot;
*&quot;To the &quot;Nationalities Issue&quot; or about &quot;Autonomization&quot;&quot;, &quot;К &#x27;вопросу о национальностях&#x27; или об &#x27;автономизации&#x27; &quot;

*&quot;How shall We Reorganise the Rabkrin&quot;, &quot;Как нам реорганизовать Рабкрин&quot;
*&quot;Better Less but Better&quot;, &quot;Лучше меньше, да лучше&quot;

== Contents ==
The letter is a critique of the Soviet government as it then stood. It warned of dangers that he anticipated and made suggestions for the future. Some of those suggestions included increasing the size of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee, giving the State Planning Committee legislative powers and changing the nationalities policy, which had been implemented by Stalin.

Stalin and Trotsky were criticised:

Lenin felt that Stalin had more power than he could handle and might be dangerous if he was Lenin&#x27;s successor. In a postscript written a few weeks later, Lenin recommended Stalin&#x27;s removal from the position of General Secretary of the Party:

Marxist historian Ludo Martens argues that the postscript&#x27;s complaints about Stalin&#x27;s coarseness refers to a rebuke that Stalin had made to Krupskaya twelve days earlier.

By power, Trotsky argued Lenin meant administrative power, rather than political influence, within the party. Trotsky pointed out that Lenin had effectively accused Stalin of a lack of loyalty.

In the 30 December 1922 article, &quot;Nationalities Issue&quot;, Lenin criticized the actions of Felix Dzerzhinsky, Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze and Stalin in the Georgian Affair by accusing them of &quot;Great Russian Chauvinism&quot;.

Lenin also criticised other Politburo members:

Finally, he criticised two younger Bolshevik leaders, Bukharin and Pyatakov:

Isaac Deutscher, a biographer of both Trotsky and Stalin, wrote that &quot;the whole testament breathed uncertainty&quot;.

==Political impact and repercussions==
===Short term===
Lenin&#x27;s testament presented the ruling triumvirate or troika (Joseph Stalin, Grigory Zinoviev, and Lev Kamenev) with an uncomfortable dilemma. On the one hand, they would have preferred to suppress the testament since it was critical of all three of them as well as of their ally Nikolai Bukharin and their opponents, Leon Trotsky and Georgy Pyatakov. Although Lenin&#x27;s comments were damaging to all of the communist leaders, Joseph Stalin stood to lose the most since the only practical suggestion in the testament was to remove him from the position of the General Secretary of the Party&#x27;s Central Committee.

On the other hand, the leadership dared not go directly against Lenin&#x27;s wishes so soon after his death, especially with his widow insisting on having them carried out. The leadership was also in the middle of a factional struggle over the control of the Party, the ruling faction being loosely allied groups that would soon part ways, which would have made a coverup difficult.

The final compromise proposed by the triumvirate at the Council of the Elders of the 13th Congress after Kamenev read out the text of the document was to make Lenin&#x27;s testament available to the delegates on the following conditions (first made public in a pamphlet by Trotsky published in 1934 and confirmed by documents released during and after glasnost):

* The testament would be read by representatives of the party leadership to each regional delegation separately.
* Taking notes would not be allowed.
* The testament would not be referred to during the plenary meeting of the Congress.

The proposal was adopted by a majority vote, over Krupskaya&#x27;s objections. As a result, the testament did not have the effect that Lenin had hoped for, and Stalin retained his position as General Secretary, with the notable help of Aleksandr Petrovich Smirnov, then People&#x27;s Commissar of Agriculture.

According to Rogovin, Lenin&#x27;s proposals for party reform such the elevation of the Central Control Commission and Rabkrin were significantly watered down. Rogovin stated that the membership of the Central Committee increased by nearly ten times but two-thirds of those elected to Congress were local officials subject to party and state control.

===Long term===
Failure to make the document more widely available within the party remained a point of contention during the struggle between the Left Opposition and the Stalin-Bukharin faction in 1924 to 1927. Under pressure from the opposition, Stalin had to read the testament again at the July 1926 Central Committee meeting.

Lenin&#x27;s concerns over Stalin&#x27;s harsh leadership and over a split between Trotsky and Stalin were later confirmed, with Trotsky being expelled from the Soviet Union by the Politburo in February 1929. He spent the rest of his life in exile, writing prolifically and engaging in open critique of Stalinism. In his later autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;, Trotsky would view his &quot;testament&quot; as reflective of his wider struggle against the bureaucratization of the party. He also maintained that Lenin had intended for him to be his successor as Chairman of Sovnarkom of the Soviet Union with his proposed appointment as deputy chairman. He explained that this process would have begun after their alliance in 1923 with the formation of a commission to mitigate the growth of the state bureaucracy. Trotsky maintained that this action would have facilitated the conditions for his succession in the party. In February 1940, Trotsky would write his own &quot;Testament&quot; modelled on Lenin&#x27;s, shortly before his assassination, in which he reiterated his belief in a communist future of mankind and that his personal honour among thousands of other purged victims would be rehabilitated by a &quot;new revolutionary generation&quot;.

In 1938 Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International in opposition to Stalin&#x27;s Comintern. After surviving multiple attempts on his life, Trotsky was assassinated in August 1940 in Mexico City by Ramón Mercader, an agent of the Soviet NKVD. Written out of Soviet history books under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few rivals of Stalin to not be rehabilitated by either Nikita Khrushchev or Mikhail Gorbachev. Trotsky&#x27;s rehabilitation came in June 2001 by the Russian Federation.

From the time that Stalin consolidated his position as the unquestioned leader of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union, in the late 1920s, all references to Lenin&#x27;s testament were considered anti-Soviet agitation and punishable as such. The denial of the existence of Lenin&#x27;s testament remained one of the cornerstones of historiography in the Soviet Union until Stalin&#x27;s death on March 5, 1953. After Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences, at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party, in 1956, the document was finally published officially by the Soviet government.

<doc id="611370" wikidata="Q740161" url="?curid=611370" title="John Wesley Harding">
<text>John Wesley Harding is the eighth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on December 27, 1967, by Columbia Records. Produced by Bob Johnston, the album marked Dylan&#x27;s return to semi-acoustic instrumentation and folk-influenced songwriting after three albums of lyrically abstract, blues-indebted rock music. &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; was recorded around the same time as the home recording sessions with the Band known as &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;.

&quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; was well received by critics and sold well, reaching on the U.S. charts and topping the UK charts. Less than three months after its release, &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA. &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; became one of his most popular songs after Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s rendition was released in the autumn of 1968.

The album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2003, it was ranked number 301 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, moving to 303 in the 2012 version of that list, then to 337 in the 2020 version. It was voted number 203 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

The album is named after Texas outlaw John Wesley Hardin, whose name was misspelled.

==Recording sessions==
Dylan went to work on &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; in the fall of 1967. By then, 18 months had passed since the completion of &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;. Dylan spent a substantial amount of time recording the informal basement sessions with the Band in West Saugerties, New York. During that time, he stockpiled a large number of recordings, including many new compositions. He eventually submitted nearly all of them for copyright, but declined to include any of them in his next studio release (Dylan would not release any of those recordings to the commercial market until 1975&#x27;s &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;, by which time some of them had been bootlegged, usually sourced from an easy-to-find set of publisher&#x27;s demos). Instead, Dylan used a different set of songs for &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;.

It is not known when these songs were actually written, but none of them have turned up in the dozens of basement recordings that have since surfaced. Robbie Robertson, the guitarist and principal songwriter of the Band, recalled that &quot;it was just on a kind of whim that Bob went down to Nashville. And there, with just a couple of guys, he put those songs down on tape.&quot; Those sessions took place in the autumn of 1967, requiring less than twelve hours over three stints in the studio.

Dylan was once again recording with a band, but the instrumentation was very sparse. During most of the recording, the rhythm section of drummer Kenneth A. Buttrey and bassist Charlie McCoy were the only ones supporting Dylan, who handled all harmonica, guitar, piano, and vocal parts. &quot;I didn&#x27;t intentionally come out with some kind of mellow sound,&quot; Dylan said in 1971. &quot;I would have liked… more steel guitar, more piano. More music… I didn&#x27;t sit down and plan that sound.&quot;

The first session, held on October 17 at Columbia&#x27;s Studio A, lasted only three hours, with Dylan recording master takes of &quot;I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine&quot;, &quot;Drifter&#x27;s Escape&quot;, and &quot;The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest&quot;. Dylan returned to the studio on November 6, recording master takes for &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;, &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;, &quot;As I Went Out One Morning&quot;, &quot;I Pity the Poor Immigrant&quot;, and &quot;I Am a Lonesome Hobo&quot;. Dylan returned for one last session on November 29, completing all of the remaining work.

Sometime between the second and third session, Dylan approached Robertson and keyboardist/saxophonist Garth Hudson to furnish overdubs on the basic tracks, but as Robertson recalled: &quot;We did talk about doing some overdubbing on it, but I really liked it when I heard it and I couldn&#x27;t really think right about overdubbing on it. So it ended up coming out the way he brought it back.&quot;

Dylan had arrived in Nashville with a set of songs similar to the feverish yet pithy compositions that came out of &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot;. They would be given an austere sound that he and his producer Bob Johnston thought sympathetic to their content. Johnston recalls that &quot;he was staying in the Ramada Inn down there, and he played me his songs and he suggested we just use bass and guitar and drums on the record. I said fine, but also suggested we add a steel guitar, which is how Pete Drake came to be on that record.&quot; The final session did break from the status quo by employing Pete Drake on the final two recordings. Cut between 9pm and 12 midnight, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Baby Tonight&quot; and &quot;Down Along the Cove&quot; would be the only two songs featuring Drake&#x27;s light pedal steel guitar.

&quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; was Dylan&#x27;s last LP to be issued simultaneously in both monophonic (CL 2804) and stereophonic (CS 9604) formats. By the middle of the following year, most of Dylan&#x27;s LPs would be released solely in stereophonic.

On November 1, 2019, Dylan released several new outtakes from this album and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; on &quot;The Bootleg Series, Vol. 15: Travelin&#x27; Thru 1967–1969.&quot;

==Packaging==
The album is named after Texas outlaw John Wesley Hardin, whose name Dylan misspelled. Singer Wesley Stace, who used the stage name John Wesley Harding, said in a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial that &quot;no one knows why&quot; Dylan misspelled Hardin&#x27;s name in the title, and that to his knowledge, &quot;no one’s ever bothered to ask&quot;. The cover photograph of &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; shows a squinting Dylan flanked by brothers Luxman and Purna Das, two Bengali Bauls, Indian musicians brought to Woodstock by Dylan&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman. Behind Dylan is Charlie Joy, a local stonemason and carpenter.

Upon the album&#x27;s release, rumors circulated that the faces of the Beatles were hidden on the front cover in the knots of the tree. When contacted by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1968, album cover photographer John Berg &quot;acknowledged their presence but was reluctant to talk about it.&quot; However, in a 1995 interview, Berg clarified that although the images seem to resemble the Beatles, this was not done intentionally, nor was he aware of the resemblance until it was pointed out to him after the album&#x27;s release: &quot;Later on, I got a call from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in San Francisco. Someone had discovered little pictures of the Beatles and the hand of Jesus in the tree trunk. Well, I had a proof of the cover on my wall, so I went and turned it upside down and sure enough . . . Hahaha! I mean, if you wanted to see it, you could see it. I was as amazed as anybody.&quot;

The album sleeve is also notable for its liner notes, written by Dylan himself. The liner notes tells the story of three kings and three characters (Terry Shute, Frank, and Frank&#x27;s wife, Vera) incorporating details from the album&#x27;s songs.

==Release dates==
Contradictory release dates have been claimed for &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;. The liner notes to the Dylan mono box states December 17, 1967 as the original date of release. Reproduced in the liner notes to the eleventh volume of the Dylan &quot;Bootleg Series&quot; is an article by Al Aronowitz for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, date stamped December 23, 1967, in which he states that &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; would be released &quot;within the next two weeks&quot;. Original CD editions from the 1980s and 1990s have the copyright year of 1968. The January 20 issue of &quot;Billboard&quot; reported on the &quot;blockbuster response&quot; to the LP, saying: &quot;In stores less than a week, the record is reported to have sold more than 250,000 copies.&quot; In his encyclopedia of all things Dylan, Michael Gray indicates a January 1968 release date for the LP.

In the February 3, 1968 issue of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, the album was reviewed and announced for release in Britain on February 23. It first charted there on March 2, at number 25, before achieving a run of 13 weeks at number 1.

The album was re-released as one of the 15 Dylan titles remastered for Hybrid SACD on September 16, 2003, and was reissued again as part of &quot;The Original Mono Recordings&quot; on October 10, 2010.

==Legacy==
&quot;I asked Columbia to release it with no publicity and no hype, because this was the season of hype,&quot; Dylan said. Clive Davis urged Dylan to pull a single, but even then Dylan refused, preferring to maintain the album&#x27;s low-key profile.

In a year when psychedelia dominated popular culture, the agrarian-themed &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; was seen as reactionary. Critic Jon Landau wrote in &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot; magazine, &quot;For an album of this kind to be released amidst &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, &quot;After Bathing at Baxter&#x27;s&quot;, somebody must have had a lot of confidence in what he was doing… Dylan seems to feel no need to respond to the predominate trends in pop music at all. And he is the only major pop artist about whom this can be said.&quot;

The critical stature of &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; has continued to grow. As late as 2000, Clinton Heylin wrote, &quot;&quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; remains one of Dylan&#x27;s most enduring albums. Never had Dylan constructed an album-as-an-album so self-consciously. Not tempted to incorporate even later basement visions like &#x27;Going to Acapulco&#x27; and &#x27;Clothesline Saga,&#x27; Dylan managed in less than six weeks to construct his most perfectly executed official collection.&quot;

The album was remastered and re-released in 2003 using a new technology, SACD.

In 2016, the band The Chairman Dances released &quot;Augustine&quot;, a response song to John Wesley Harding&#x27;s &quot;I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine&quot;. In it, Augustine of Hippo says he&#x27;s not sure why Dylan dreams about him. 

While legend has it that Dylan recorded &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; after finishing &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; sessions with members of the Band, several biographers and discographers have argued that the final reel of basement recordings actually postdates the first &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; session.

Regardless of when this session actually occurred, the Band did accompany Dylan for at least one performance in the months following &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;. After hearing of Woody Guthrie&#x27;s passing (two weeks before &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot;″s first session), Dylan contacted Harold Leventhal, Guthrie&#x27;s longtime friend and manager, and extended an early acceptance to any invitation for any memorial show that might be planned. The memorial came on January 20, 1968, with a pair of shows at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall. Sharing the bill with his folk contemporaries like Tom Paxton, Judy Collins, and Guthrie&#x27;s son, Arlo, Dylan gave his first public performances in twenty months, backed by the Band (billed then as the Crackers). They played only three songs (&quot;Grand Coulee Dam&quot;, &quot;Dear Mrs. Roosevelt&quot;, and &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Got No Home&quot;), and it would be another eighteen months before Dylan would again perform in concert.

As 1967 came to a close, Dylan&#x27;s lifestyle became more stable. His wife, Sara, had given birth to their daughter, Anna, earlier that summer. He had reconciled with his estranged parents. A long contract negotiation ended in a lucrative new deal, allowing Dylan to stay with Columbia Records. While the media would never lose interest, Dylan maintained a low enough profile that kept him out of the spotlight.

After his appearance at Woody Guthrie&#x27;s memorial concert, 1968 would see little, if any, musical activity from Bob Dylan. His songs continued to be a major presence, appearing on landmark albums by Jimi Hendrix, the Byrds, and the Band, but Dylan himself would not release or perform any additional music. There was very little songwriting activity, as well. &quot;One day I was half-stepping, and the lights went out,&quot; Dylan would recall ten years later. &quot;And since that point, I more or less had amnesia… It took me a long time to get to do consciously what I used to be able to do unconsciously.&quot; Around this time, there were significant changes in Dylan&#x27;s private life: his father died from a heart attack, prompting Dylan to return to Hibbing to attend the funeral. Shortly afterwards, on July 30, 1968, Sara gave birth to their third child, Samuel Isaac Abram.

<text>Berguedà () is an inland comarca in the central region of Catalonia, Spain. It lies partly in the Pyrenees and Pre-Pyrenees, and partly in the Catalan Central Depression. The capital is the city of Berga.

==Geography==

The northern half of Berguedà, known as &quot;Alt Berguedà&quot; (“Upper Berguedà”), consists of the upper Llobregat Valley and the mountainous areas surrounding it. Its northern border is a veritable mountain barrier: Berguedà is separated from Cerdanya by a chain of 2,000-meter peaks. These include the mountain ranges of Cadí, Moixeró, Puig d&#x27;Alp and Puigllançada. In this area the population is centered mainly in the Llobregat Valley and the valleys of the rivers Bagà, Bastareny and Saldes. To the east are the mountain ranges of Catllaràs and Rasos de Tubau, to the west the high ranges of Pedraforca, Verd, Ensija and Rasos de Peguera.

The more populous &quot;Baix Berguedà&quot; (&quot;Lower Berguedà&quot;) is the southern part of the comarca. It lies along the foothills of the Pyrenees, transitioning into the plains of the Catalan Central Depression. In addition to towns of medieval origin such as Gironella, Casserres, or Puig-reig, it includes a large number of industrial colonies built along the Llobregat river after the Industrial Revolution.

==Climate==

Alt Berguedà is rainy and (by Catalan standards) cold, with snow in the winter on the higher peaks. Average annual precipitation exceeds 1000 mm (40 inches), mostly in the warmer seasons.

The vegetation consists mainly of forests of Scots pine and oak. Shadier areas have European beech and, less often, silver fir. Above 1700 meters, Mountain Pine dominates and above 2200 meters the vegetation consists primarily of alpine meadows. The southern half of Berguedà consists of lower valleys, with a dry Mediterranean climate. Average annual precipitation is 700 to 900 mm (28 to 36 inches), with very little precipitation in the summer. Average annual temperatures fall between 11 and 13 °C, with cold winters, but without excessively hot summers. The naturally occurring vegetation is &quot;carrascara&quot; (round-leafed oak, &quot;Quercus ilex&quot; subsp. &quot;rotundifolia&quot;) in dry areas with poor soil and oaks where there is better soil and more rain. In the center and to the west, Portuguese oak (&quot;Quercus faginea&quot;) dominates, to the west and north downy oak (&quot;Quercus pubescens&quot;, syn. &quot;Q. humilis&quot;). Nowadays, these are intermixed with Scots pine and Aleppo pine.

== Population and economy==
Berguedà has always been sparsely populated. In 1860 there were 31,544 inhabitants, but by 1887 the population had fallen to a low of 23,257. The 1900 census showed a slight rebound to 27,217 inhabitants. For the next 60 years, growing opportunities in mining, textiles, forestry, cattle ranching, and agriculture led to a slow but steady increase, with 39,600 inhabitants in 1930, 41,938 in 1950 and 47,953 in 1960. Then, with a decline in the local economy (especially a fall-off in mining) coinciding with greater opportunity elsewhere, another decline of the economy and population set in, with the population falling to 44,446 in 1970, 42,152 in 1981, and a mere 40,555 today.

Currently, industrial activity is located mainly in between Berga and Puig-reig. The opening of the Cadí Tunnel and the general improvement of the roads in recent () years may improve the economic potential of the Llobregat Valley and of Berguedà in general.

Agriculture, cattle ranching and forestry have proven generally complementary to one another and compatible with tourism. The growth in tourism has provided some jobs and has been a key factor in reducing emigration from Alt Berguedà. Many farmhouses have been converted (in whole or in part) to tourism-related uses.

The current Berguedà population as of 2019 is 44,632 people.

==Main sights==
Berguedà is well known for Pedraforca Mountain (traditionally considered a meeting place for witches&#x27; covens), for its pastoral and mountain scenery, and for its many Romanesque churches. Another oft-visited sight is the Mountain of Queralt (home to a sanctuary housing the Comarca&#x27;s patroness, Our Lady of Queralt), which is served by many hiking trails and offers views of much of Berguedà and the surrounding comarques. The comarca also boasts many medieval bridges and has preserved many old town centers, most notably those of Berga and Bagà.

==Events==
Berguedà is well known for its many traditional festivals. The most famous is certainly the &quot;Patum&quot;, a week-long celebration held in Berga every summer. During the Patum, representations of different mythological beasts and historical figures take to the streets, and concerts and banquets are also organized in the town. Another well-known celebration is the Fia-faia, held every Christmas Eve in Bagà and Sant Julià de Cerdanyola. This pre-Christian tradition marks the winter solstice, with participants carrying lighted bundles of &quot;Cephalaria leucanta&quot; from a bonfire in the mountains to the west of either town (where the sun is seen to set) to the main square.

<text>The Selwyn by-election, a by-election in the New Zealand electorate of Selwyn – a predominantly rural district in the Canterbury Plains in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island – took place on 13 August 1994. The previous sitting MP, Ruth Richardson, precipitated the poll by resigning from parliament. Richardson planned to retire from politics, having been removed as Minister of Finance the previous year.

==Background==
The by-election was significant, as National held on to the majority of the House of Representatives by only one seat (50 to 49). This meant the party would have lost its majority in the House if it failed to retain the seat, and it would have required the formation of a coalition or a confidence-and-supply agreement with another parliamentary party – probably New Zealand First or the Alliance – to maintain governance.

All &quot;major&quot; New Zealand political parties of the day contested the by-election. David Carter, the National Party candidate, won the seat, and therefore the distribution of seats in Parliament did not change . In second place, and only around four hundred votes behind Carter, came the Alliance&#x27;s John Wright, in a result that surprised many commentators. National&#x27;s traditional opponent, the Labour Party, placed a distant third. The fourth &quot;major&quot; candidate represented the New Zealand First party: Tim Shadbolt, then Mayor of Invercargill.

==Results==

<doc id="611382" wikidata="Q6084910" url="?curid=611382" title="Ismail of Johor">
<text>Sultan Sir Ismail Al-Khalidi Ibni Almarhum Sultan Sir Ibrahim Al-Masyhur (Jawi: سلطان سر إسماعيل الخالدي ابن المرحوم سلطان سر إبراهيم المشهور; October 1894 – 10 May 1981) was the 23rd Sultan of Johor and the 3rd Sultan of Modern Johor.

==Early life==
Tunku Ismail was born on 28 October 1894 in the Istana Semayam in Johor Bahru and was the second and eldest surviving son of Tunku Ibrahim (later Sultan Ibrahim) by his first wife, Sultanah Ungku Maimunah binti Ungku Abdul Majid. He was made the Tunku Mahkota of Johor on 2 November 1895, when Tunku Ibrahim was installed as the Sultan of Johor following Sultan Abu Bakar&#x27;s death. He started his early education in a Malay school in Johor Bahru. In 1904, He was sent to England to attend Rose Hill School in Tunbrdige Wells, Kent and Aldeburgh Lodge School in Suffolk as well as Roydon Hall in Norfolk and Christ Church in Oxford; his brothers Tunku Abu Bakar and Tunku Ahmad as well as his five friends, including Onn Jaafar later followed suit. In 1910, Tunku Ismail, accompanied by Onn Jaafar, returned to Johor and spent three years in Perak, where they enrolled into the Malay College Kuala Kangsar. In 1913, He was once again sent to England to receive his tertiary education in a boarding school; his brothers again later followed suit until 5 March 1920.

==Regent==
Tunku Ismail was made the Johor&#x27;s regent in 1928 as Sultan Ibrahim began to spend more time travelling overseas. In 1937, Tunku Ismail appointed Onn Jaafar by this point a state executive councillor, as his private secretary and entrusted him to run the Johor Pavilion at the world fair in San Francisco the following year. Upon Onn&#x27;s return from San Francisco, Tunku Ismail invited Onn to resume his former duties, which he accepted. Shortly before the Japanese armies occupied Johor during the Japanese Invasion of Malaya, Tunku Ismail fled to England out of fear that the Japanese military government may manipulate him onto the throne in his father&#x27;s stead.

Tunku Ismail returned to Johor after the war and was confronted with Malay nationalist movements which had erupted as a result of the rulers&#x27; dissatisfaction with the Malayan Union scheme. While Sultan Ibrahim faced widespread criticisms from the Malay grassroots and nationalist leaders due to his initial willingness to sign the Malayan Union scheme treaties with Sir Harold MacMichael, Tunku Ismail maintained neutral relations between the British government and the Malay nationalist leaders. Nevertheless, Tunku Ismail officiated the opening ceremony of the United Malays National Organisation&#x27;s (UMNO) first congress which was held at the Istana Besar in May 1946 while Sultan Ibrahim was residing in London.

Tunku Ismail took over state affairs during the late 1940s and 1950s, and presented on his father&#x27;s behalf at official functions. On 27 August 1957, Tunku Ismail was one of the nine royal signatories at the royal signing ceremony of the Malaya&#x27;s Federal Constitution. Nevertheless, he faced mild opposition from a few nationalist leaders in Johor, notably Ungku Abdullah, the party leader of Persatuan Kebangsaan Melayu Johor (PKMJ), a nationalist party that advocated for Johor&#x27;s secession from Malaya. A few days before signing the Federal constitution, Ungku Abdullah cabled to Sultan Ibrahim to boycott the signing ceremony, who notified Ungku Abdullah that he had since delegated the state&#x27;s executive powers to Tunku Ismail. Ungku Abdullah called for Tunku Ismail to boycott the signing ceremony, who quickly turned him down.

==Sultan of Johor==
Tunku Ismail succeeded his father as the Sultan of Johor on 8 May 1959. He was crowned at Throne Room of the Istana Besar, Johor Bahru on 10 February 1960. The Sultan was known to be very close to his subjects; he made annual trips to visit selected villages in the eight districts of Johor and frequently acquainted himself with the civil servants working for the state government.

==Succession issue==
On 10 August 1961, he stripped his eldest son Tunku Mahmood Iskandar, of the post of Tunku Mahkota due to misconduct–although he was given the post of Raja Muda on 1 December 1966. His second son, Tunku Abdul Rahman (1933–1989) became the Tunku Mahkota instead. However, shortly before his death in April 1981, Sultan Ismail reappointed Tunku Iskandar as the Tunku Mahkota, who succeeded him the following month.

==Personal life==
A meek and quiet ruler by nature, Sultan Ismail was an animal lover and was instrumental in the setting up of the Johor Zoo. He also had a collection of wild animals ranging from deer to crocodiles. Among the Chinese community in Johor, he was known affectionately as &quot;Lau Sultan&quot;, literally meaning &quot;an old or elderly Sultan&quot;.

Sultan Ismail married twice. Both wives served as Sultanahs of Johor. They were:
* Sultanah Ungku Tun Aminah binti Ungku Ahmad (born 5 February 1905 – 14 September 1977), a second cousin of the Sultan, married on 30 August 1920. Sultanah Aminah died in a road accident in 1977. He had seven children with her, only three of whom survived into adulthood:
** Tunku Abdul Jalil (born 1924-1925)
** Tunku Kalthum Maimunah (born 1927-1930)
** Tunku Abdul Rahman (born 1930-1930)
** Tunku Mahmood Iskandar (Sultan of Johor) (born 1932-2010)
** Tunku Abdul Rahman (Tunku Bendahara of Johor) (born 1933-1989)
** Tunku Helen (born 1936-1937)
** Tunku Tun Maimunah (Tunku Gedong) (born 1939-2012)

* Sultanah Tengku Nora binti Tengku Panglima Raja Ahmad (born 10 October 1937), member of the Kelantanese royal household, married on 13 November 1977. She is the sister of Tengku Zanariah, the spouse of Sultan Iskandar.

He was the first Chancellor of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia when the institution was established in 1975.

In August 1977, Sultan Ismail and his wife, Ungku Tun Aminah binti Ungku Ahmad, were in a car accident in Kulai. While his wife was permanently left in a vegetative state until her death a month later owing to brain damage, the Sultan survived with only minor injuries. Nevertheless, the ordeal passed rather quickly, and Sultan Ismail remarried in November 1977 to Tengku Nora. Tengku Nora was subsequently crowned as sultanah the following October 1978.

==Death==
Sultan Ismail died on 10 May 1981 at 6:12 pm at the Royal Ward Hospital Besar, Johor Bahru after being admitted two weeks earlier following an illness at the age 86. His death was only officially announced at 8:45 pm by Menteri Besar of Johor Tan Sri Dato&#x27; Haji Othman Saat. He was brought to the Istana Besar, Johor Bahru for laying in state and was buried in the Mahmoodiah Royal Mausoleum the next day. His son the Tunku Mahkota of Johor Tunku Mahmood Iskandar was proclaimed as the next Sultan of Johor on 11 May.

<text>Christopher James Paolini (born November 17, 1983) is an American and Italian author. He is best known for &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot;, which consists of the books &quot;Eragon&quot; (2002), &quot;Eldest&quot; (2005), &quot;Brisingr&quot; (2008), &quot;Inheritance&quot; (2011), the follow-up short story collection &quot;The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm&quot; (2018), and &quot;Murtagh&quot; (2023), the first in a follow-up duology. His first science fiction novel, &quot;To Sleep in a Sea of Stars&quot;, was published on September 15, 2020. He lives in Paradise Valley, Montana, where he wrote his first book.

==Early life==
Paolini was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in the area of Paradise Valley, Montana. His family members include his parents, Kenneth Paolini and Talita Hodgkinson, and his younger sister, Angela Paolini. He is of Italian descent; his paternal grandfather was born in Rome and Paolini still has relatives there. Home schooled for the duration of his education, Paolini graduated from high school at the age of 15 through a set of accredited correspondence courses from the American School of Correspondence in Lansing, Illinois.

He has Italian citizenship.

==Career==
He started his work on his first novel, &quot;Eragon&quot;, at the age of 15. This novel would become the first of a four-book series (six, including the spinoffs) set in the mythical land of Alagaësia. 

In 2002, &quot;Eragon&quot; was published for the first time by Paolini International LLC, his parents&#x27; publishing company. To promote the book, Paolini toured over 135 schools and libraries, discussing reading and writing, all the while dressed in &quot;a medieval costume of red shirt, billowy black pants, lace-up boots, and a jaunty black cap.&quot; He drew the cover art for the first edition of &quot;Eragon&quot;, which featured Saphira&#x27;s eye, along with the maps on the inside covers of his books.

In mid-2002, the stepson of author Carl Hiaasen found &quot;Eragon&quot; in a bookstore and loved it; this led to Hiaasen bringing it to the attention of his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Knopf subsequently made an offer to publish &quot;Eragon&quot; and the rest of &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot;. The second edition of &quot;Eragon&quot; was published by Knopf in August 2003. At the age of 19, Paolini became a &quot;New York Times&quot;-bestselling author.

In December 2006, Fox 2000 released the film adaptation of &quot;Eragon&quot; in theaters around the world. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, and made a combined domestic and international gross of $249,488,115 USD against a production budget of $100,000,000.

&quot;Eldest&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Eragon&quot;, was released August 23, 2005. The third book in the cycle, &quot;Brisingr&quot;, was released on September 20, 2008. Although &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot; was originally planned as a trilogy, a fourth book, &quot;Inheritance&quot;, was released on November 8, 2011, in the US, Australia, New Zealand, the EU, and India, and was subsequently translated and published in 53 countries. &quot;The Inheritance Cycle&quot; has sold more than 41 million copies.

On December 31, 2018, &quot;The Fork, the Witch, and the Worm&quot;, the first book in a series called &quot;Tales of Alagaësia&quot;, was published and released to the public.

Paolini&#x27;s new science fiction novel, &quot;To Sleep in a Sea of Stars&quot;, was released on September 15, 2020, by Tor Books.

In October 2021, Christopher released &quot;Unity&quot;, an interactive Fractalverse story on his science fiction website Fractalverse.net.

On July 25, 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Paolini was co-writing a live action television series adaptation of &quot;Eragon&quot; for Disney+, with Bert Salke executive producing.

On October 3, 2022, Paolini announced &quot;Fractal Noise&quot;, the second installment in the Fractalverse and a prequel to &quot;To Sleep in a Sea of Stars&quot;. It was published on May 16, 2023.

On October 8, 2022, it was announced that &quot;To Sleep in a Sea of Stars&quot; has been optioned by Made Up Stories and Snoot Entertainment.

On November 7, 2023, &quot;Murtagh&quot; was released as the latest installment in Paolini&#x27;s world of Alagaësia.

==Influences==
Paolini&#x27;s literary inspirations include the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and E. R. Eddison, as well as the epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;. Paolini has said that &quot;Eragon&quot; was &quot;specifically inspired&quot; by &quot;Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher&quot;, by Bruce Coville. Other literary influences include David Eddings, Andre Norton, Brian Jacques, Anne McCaffrey, Raymond E. Feist, Mervyn Peake, Ursula K. Le Guin and Frank Herbert. Other favorite books include works by Jane Yolen, Philip Pullman, and Garth Nix.

Nature influences much of Paolini&#x27;s writing. In an interview with Sir Philip Pullman and Tamora Pierce, Paolini said that Paradise Valley, Montana, is &quot;one of the main sources&quot; of his inspiration.

In the acknowledgments of &quot;Brisingr&quot;, Paolini acknowledged the influence of Leon and Hiroko Kapp&#x27;s &quot;The Craft of the Japanese Sword&quot; for his description of the forging of Eragon&#x27;s sword. Additionally, Paolini has admitted that he is a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan, which inspired his reference to the &quot;lonely god&quot; (the epithet given to the Doctor by the Face of Boe in the episode &quot;New Earth&quot;), to &quot;rooms that are bigger on the inside than the outside&quot; (from &quot;Questions Unanswered&quot; in &quot;Inheritance&quot;), as well as to Raxacoricofallapatorius, the home of the Slitheen (&quot;Blood Price&quot; in &quot;Inheritance&quot;).

==Reception==
Paolini&#x27;s books have topped the charts of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, and &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; bestsellers lists.

The Guinness World Records recognized Christopher Paolini as the &quot;youngest author of a bestselling book series&quot; on January 5, 2011.

In 2024, the American Library Association chose &quot;Fractal Noise&quot; for the Listen List (2024).

<text>Sultan Abu Bakar Ri’ayatuddin Al-Mu’azzam Shah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Abdullah Al-Mu’tassim Billah Shah (Jawi: ; 29 May 1904 – 5 May 1974), was the fourth modern Sultan of Pahang.

==Life==
Born on 29 May 1904 at Istana Hinggap, Pekan, he was the second son of Sultan Abdullah Al-Mu’tassim Billah Shah by his second wife, Som binti Tun.

Succeeding his father in 1932, he quickly became known as a friendly and approachable ruler by his subjects. During the Japanese occupation of Malaya, he discreetly encouraged resistance movements such as the Askar Wataniah, Force 136 and the Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army.

However, due to his penchant for marrying commoners, including several popular actresses and singers, he was less popular with other Malay rulers and they declined to choose him as Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia on five separate occasions.

== Family ==
He was married to Tengku Ampuan Pahang Raja Fatimah, the daughter of Sultan Iskandar of Perak, in Kuala Kangsar, Perak. It was a marriage between two royal relatives.

He died on 5 May 1974 at the Istana Peninjau, Kampung Padang Polo, Pekan at age 69 and was succeeded by his son Sultan Ahmad Shah.

<text>Rick Derringer (born Richard Dean Zehringer; August 5, 1947) is an American musician, producer, and songwriter. He gained success in the 1960s with his band, the McCoys. Their debut single, &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot;, became a number-one hit in 1965 and is now regarded as a classic track from the garage rock era. The McCoys had seven songs chart in the top 100, including covers of &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Come on Let&#x27;s Go&quot;.

In 1970, Derringer found further success with his song &quot;Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot;. He also worked extensively with brothers Edgar and Johnny Winter, playing lead and backing guitar in their bands and producing all of their gold and platinum records, including Edgar Winter&#x27;s hits &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Free Ride&quot; (both in 1973). Derringer has also collaborated with Steely Dan, Cyndi Lauper, and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, producing Yankovic&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning songs &quot;Eat It&quot; (1984) and &quot;Fat&quot; (1988). Additionally, Derringer produced the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s album &quot;The Wrestling Album&quot; (1985) and its follow-up, &quot;&quot; (1987). These albums featured the entrance song for Hulk Hogan, &quot;Real American&quot;, and the theme for the Demolition tag team, &quot;Demolition&quot;. Derringer also produced three songs from the soundtrack of the 1984 Tom Hanks film &quot;Bachelor Party&quot;.

==Life and career==
===Early life and 1960s===
Derringer was born in Celina, Ohio, and grew up in Fort Recovery, the son of John Otto and Janice Lavine (Thornburg) Zehringer, a section foreman on the Nickel Plate Railroad. According to Derringer, aside from his parents&#x27; extensive record collection, his first major influence was his uncle, Jim Thornburg, a popular guitarist and singer in Ohio. Derringer recalled first hearing him play guitar in the kitchen of his parents&#x27; home and knowing immediately that he wanted to learn the instrument. He was eight years old at the time, and his parents gave him his first electric guitar for his ninth birthday. Soon after, he and his brother Randy began playing music together.

After eighth grade, the family moved to Union City, Indiana, where Derringer formed a band he initially called the McCoys. He later renamed it the Rick Z Combo and then Rick and the Raiders before reverting to the original name.

In the summer of 1965, before Derringer turned 18, the McCoys were hired to back up a New York-based band called the Strangeloves in concert. The Strangeloves, who were also record producers from New York City, were looking for a band to record the song &quot;My Girl Sloopy&quot; and chose the McCoys. Derringer later persuaded the producers to change the title to &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot;. After the Strangeloves recorded the guitar and instrumental parts, Derringer and the McCoys were brought into the studio to sing on the recording, which was then released under their name. The song reached number one on the charts while The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Yesterday&quot; held the number two spot. &quot;Hang On Sloopy&quot; has since become synonymous with Derringer&#x27;s home state of Ohio, as fans of the Ohio State Buckeyes often chant &quot;O-H-I-O&quot; during breaks in the song&#x27;s chorus, and it is frequently played at home football games at Ohio Stadium. The song is also played during Cleveland Guardians home games at Progressive Field.

Derringer married Liz Agriss in 1969.

===1970s===

Derringer, along with his band, the McCoys, joined Johnny Winter in a group they called &quot;Johnny Winter And,&quot; with the &quot;And&quot; referring to the McCoys. Derringer later became part of Edgar Winter&#x27;s White Trash and subsequently the Edgar Winter Group.

In 1973, Derringer released his first solo album, &quot;All American Boy&quot;, which featured his hit song &quot;Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot;. By then, the song had already appeared on &quot;Johnny Winter And&quot; (1970) and the White Trash &quot;Roadwork&quot; (1972) albums. Derringer&#x27;s version reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, becoming his highest-charting single. One critic described the album as a &quot;sadly neglected album of great merit&quot;.

Derringer&#x27;s later albums, both solo and with his band Derringer, included 1977&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Evil&quot;, co-written with Cynthia Weil and &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue&quot; author Larry Sloman. He also released the critically acclaimed album &quot;Guitars and Women&quot; (1979), which was re-released with liner notes by Razor &amp; Tie in 1998.

Around this time, Derringer played guitar on two Steely Dan tracks: &quot;Show Biz Kids&quot; on &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; (1973) and &quot;Chain Lightning&quot; on &quot;Katy Lied&quot; (1975). Derringer is credited with helping Donald Fagen secure a record deal in 1972.

During this period, Derringer collaborated with his neighbor Todd Rundgren, playing on four of Rundgren&#x27;s solo albums. He was also a regular in Andy Warhol&#x27;s circle and frequently visited Warhol&#x27;s studio, The Factory.

=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Derringer played guitar on &quot;My Rival&quot; from Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Gaucho&quot; (1980) and also contributed to Donald Fagen&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;The Nightfly&quot; (1982). In 1983, he played guitar on two hit power ballads written and produced by Jim Steinman: Air Supply&#x27;s &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; and Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;. Derringer has stated that his guitar solo in &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; is his favorite of all the solos he has recorded. That same year, he recorded guitar parts for Meat Loaf&#x27;s poorly received album &quot;Midnight at the Lost and Found&quot;. Both &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; and &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; were originally offered to Meat Loaf by Steinman for that album, but Meat Loaf&#x27;s record company refused to pay Steinman for the compositions. 

In 1983, Derringer also wrote &quot;Shake Me&quot; for his &quot;Good Dirty Fun&quot; solo album, accompanied by a video produced by Jake Hooker, the husband of Lorna Luft. Singer Lourett Russell Grant appeared in the video alongside Derringer.

In 1984, Derringer played guitar on Barbra Streisand&#x27;s cover of Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Left in the Dark,&quot; released as the lead single from her album &quot;Emotion&quot;.

In 1985, Derringer&#x27;s friendship with Cyndi Lauper led him and Steinman to collaborate again, with Derringer producing &quot;The Wrestling Album&quot; (1985) for the World Wrestling Federation, an album consisting mostly of wrestlers&#x27; theme songs. He wrote several songs for the album, including Hulk Hogan&#x27;s theme song &quot;Real American,&quot; co-written with Bernard Kenny. This song was notably used by U.S. President Barack Obama at the 2011 White House Correspondents&#x27; Dinner, where he played the song while unveiling his birth certificate. It was also used as a campaign song by Hillary Clinton, as a victory song by Newt Gingrich, and in four videos during the campaign of Donald Trump.

In 1986, Derringer returned to working with Meat Loaf for &quot;Blind Before I Stop&quot;, co-writing the song &quot;Masculine.&quot;

Also in 1986, he played guitar on two songs from Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s album &quot;True Colors&quot;, &quot;Calm Inside the Storm&quot; and &quot;The Faraway Nearby.&quot; From 1986 to 1992, he served as a guitarist on her tours, comparing her live performances to those of Barbra Streisand by saying, &quot;.&quot; He played with Lauper again on her third album, &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, which was released in 1989.
In 1987, Meat Loaf appeared on &quot;Way Off Broadway&quot;, a nationally distributed cable TV show with Derringer as the music director. The show was hosted by comedienne and interviewer Joy Behar. Other guests on the show included Larry Carlton, Robbie Dupree, and Edgar Winter.

Also in 1987, Derringer returned to the World Wrestling Federation to produce its second music album, &quot;&quot;. He co-wrote the theme song for Demolition and also recorded a new version of &quot;Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot; as a duet with Gene Okerlund.

He worked for several New York City-based jingle houses in the 1980s. Derringer went on to produce &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s debut album, &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&quot; (1983). Between 1983 and 1989, Derringer produced six Yankovic albums, for which he received his only Grammy Award. Yankovic has expressed openness to working with Derringer again.

In 1997, Derringer became an Evangelical Christian. Since then, he has consistently aligned himself with conservative causes in the United States. Derringer describes himself as a &quot;Jesus freak&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
In 2001, Derringer, Tim Bogert and Carmine Appice released the album Derringer, Bogert &amp; Appice (DBA): &quot;Doin&#x27; Business as...&quot; on the German record label Steamhammer Records. Derringer had previously worked with Appice on an album, &quot;Party Tested&quot; by DNA (Derringer&#x27;n&#x27;Appice), and it was re-released in 2011.

In 2001, Derringer, his wife, and their children released the first two of four Christian music albums, all through Panda Studio Productions: &quot;Aiming 4 Heaven&quot; (2001), &quot;Derringer X 2&quot; (2001), the holiday album, &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; (2004), and &quot;We Live&quot; (2008). In 2002, Derringer was featured in a book written by Dan Muise, titled &quot;Gallagher, Marriott, Derringer &amp; Trower – Their Lives and Music&quot;.

He released &quot;Free Ride Smooth Jazz&quot; (2002), which featured vocals by his wife Jenda (&quot;née&quot; Brenda Jean), who sang the title song &quot;Free Ride&quot; and co-wrote the song &quot;Hot &amp; Cool&quot; with Derringer. Also included is his smooth jazz radio hit remake, &quot;Jazzy Koo&quot;.

In May 2009, he self-released the album &quot;Knighted by the Blues&quot; and its popular song, &quot;Sometimes,&quot; which was once again co-written with Jenda. Derringer followed up with the release of &quot;The Three Kings of the Blues&quot; (Freddie King, B.B. King, Albert King) on Mike Varney&#x27;s Blues Bureau International Records.
Derringer and a range of hitmakers are part of Voices, a company that finds private events many times a year. Some of the artists involved with Voices include Tone-Loc, Wally Palmar, Kim Carnes, Belinda Carlisle, Tommy Tutone, Mark McGrath, Fastball, Skip Martin, Jakob Dylan, Natasha Bedingfield, Coolio, John Rzeznik, Martha Davis, Silverchair, Steve Augeri, John Elefante, Alex Ligertwood, Jeff Lyons, and the Rembrandts.

Derringer went on three world tours with Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band. Rehearsals began in June 2010, and they traveled across Europe, Russia, South America, Mexico, and the USA. The tour featured Wally Palmar, Edgar Winter, Gary Wright, Richard Page, and Gregg Bissonette.

In the 1980s, he produced the Kodomo Band and toured in Asia, including with Edgar Winter, during the 1990 White Light tour.

In 2013, he and Jenda created the Asia Project after she discovered that the two largest-selling songs in history are Chinese. As Ricky Wu and Jenda Tu, the Derringers recorded and released their versions of the songs: Wang Qiwen and Yang Chengang&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;Mouse Loves Rice,&quot; and the actress Liu Shi Shi&#x27;s &quot;Season of Waiting.&quot;

In 2014, Derringer performed on Peter Frampton&#x27;s Guitar Circus tour with other notable guitarists, including B.B. King, Roger McGuinn (ex-Byrds), Don Felder (ex-Eagles), Leslie West (ex-Mountain), Cheap Trick&#x27;s Rick Nielsen, Toto&#x27;s Steve Lukather, Los Lobos&#x27; David Hidalgo, and Pearl Jam&#x27;s Mike McCready.

In 2017, Derringer was charged with carrying a loaded gun on a Delta Air Lines flight from Cancún in Mexico to Atlanta, Georgia. According to his manager, Derringer believed he was permitted to carry the gun due to his possession of a valid Florida concealed weapon permit. Derringer later pleaded guilty, agreeing to pay a $1,000 fine, and stated that it would not happen again, &quot;not even a water pistol&quot;.

A re-recording of 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Wrestling Album&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Real American&quot; with updated lyrics was released on May 28, 2017, debuting on Alex Jones&#x27;s radio show. The lyric &quot;I gotta be a man, I can&#x27;t let it slide&quot; was changed to &quot;I gotta lend a hand, I can&#x27;t let it slide,&quot; and &quot;fight for the right of every man&quot; became &quot;fight for the rights of everyone.&quot; Additionally, &quot;Best not mess with my US&quot; was added before the second verse, along with a new line stating, &quot;Ours is a cause that&#x27;s right and just, we&#x27;re built on truth, in God we trust.&quot; That same year, Derringer appeared on Alex Jones&#x27;s show, where he was interviewed by political consultant Roger Stone about Derringer&#x27;s support for Donald Trump.

In 2017, Derringer collaborated with baseball players Tom Seaver and Gary Redus to release a version of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame,&quot; honoring his lifelong love of baseball.

In 2018, Derringer embarked on a tour with Vanilla Fudge, Mitch Ryder, and Badfinger under the name &quot;HippieFest.&quot;

He performed the guitar solo for an anti-bullying campaign version of &quot;Hang on Sloopy&quot; by the Love Love Kids, released in October 2019.

==In other media==
&quot;Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot; is featured in the 1993 film &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, as well as in the Xbox 360 version of &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot; in 2007 and &quot;Rock Band 4&quot; in 2015. The song was also made available as downloadable content for the guitar learning software/game &quot;Rocksmith 2014&quot; in January 2015.

<doc id="611401" wikidata="Q57409" url="?curid=611401" title="Hans Oster">
<text>Hans Paul Oster (9 August 1887 – 9 April 1945) was a general in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and a leading figure of the anti-Nazi German resistance from 1938 to 1943. As deputy head of the counter-espionage bureau in the &quot;Abwehr&quot; (German military intelligence), Oster was in a good position to conduct resistance operations under the guise of intelligence work.

He was involved in the Oster conspiracy of September 1938 and was arrested in 1943 on suspicion of helping &quot;Abwehr&quot; officers caught helping Jews to escape Germany. After the failed 1944 July Plot on Hitler&#x27;s life, during interrogation, he named Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of &quot;Abwehr&quot;, as the &quot;spiritual founder of the Resistance Movement&quot;. The Gestapo arrested Canaris and eventually found his diaries, in which Oster&#x27;s anti-Nazi activities were revealed. In April 1945, he was hanged with Canaris and Dietrich Bonhoeffer at Flossenbürg concentration camp.

==Early career==
Oster was born in Dresden, Saxony in 1887, the son of an Alsatian pastor of the French Protestant Church. He entered the artillery in 1907 and in World War I, he served on the Western Front until 1916, when he was appointed as captain to the German General Staff. After the war, he was thought of well enough to be kept in the reduced &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, whose officer corps was limited to 4,000 by the Treaty of Versailles. He had to resign from the army in 1932, when he got into trouble with a married woman.

He soon found a job in a new organisation which Hermann Göring set up under the Prussian police. He transferred to the &quot;Abwehr&quot; in October 1933. It was in this connection that he met Hans Bernd Gisevius and Arthur Nebe, who were working in the &quot;Gestapo&quot; and became conspirators. Oster also became a confidant of Admiral Canaris.

==Opposition to Adolf Hitler==
Like many other army officers, Oster welcomed the Nazi regime. However, his opinion changed after the 1934 &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot; in which the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) murdered many of the leaders of the rival &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) and their political opponents, including General Kurt von Schleicher, the second-to-last Chancellor of the Weimar Republic and &quot;Generalmajor&quot; (Major General) Ferdinand von Bredow, former head of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;. In 1935, Oster was allowed to re-join the army but never on the General Staff. By 1938, the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair and &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; (the Nazi-led pogrom against Jews in Germany), turned his antipathy into a hatred of Nazism and a willingness to help save Jews. During the Fritsch crisis, Oster met &quot;Generaloberst&quot; (Colonel General) Ludwig Beck, Chief of the General Staff, for the first time, making the connections for the Oster conspiracy of September 1938.

Oster&#x27;s position in the &quot;Abwehr&quot; was invaluable to the conspirators; &quot;Abwehr&quot; could provide false papers and restricted materials, disguise conspiratorial activities as intelligence work, link disparate resistance cells, and supply intelligence to the conspirators. He also played a central role in the first military conspiracy to overthrow Hitler, which was rooted in Hitler&#x27;s intention to invade Czechoslovakia. In August 1938, Beck spoke openly at a meeting of army generals in Berlin about his opposition to a war with the Western powers over Czechoslovakia. When Hitler was informed of that, he demanded and received Beck&#x27;s resignation. Beck was highly respected in the army and his removal shocked the officer corps. His successor as Chief of Staff, Franz Halder, remained in touch with him and also with Oster. Privately, he said that he considered Hitler &quot;the incarnation of evil&quot;.

Oster, Gisevius and Hjalmar Schacht urged Halder and Beck to stage a coup against Hitler. However, the army generals argued that they could mobilise support among the officer corps only if Hitler made overt moves towards war. Halder asked Oster to draw up plans for a coup, and it was eventually agreed that Halder would instigate the coup when Hitler committed an overt step towards war. Emissaries of the conspirators travelled to Britain, with the assistance of Oster and the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, to urge the British to stand firm against Hitler over the Sudeten crisis. On 28 September, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain agreed to a meeting in Munich, where he accepted the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Hitler&#x27;s diplomatic triumph undermined and demoralised the conspirators. Until that time Halder seemed keen to stage a coup.

As war again grew more likely in mid-1939, the efforts for a coup were revived. Oster was still in contact with Halder and Witzleben. However, many officers, particularly those from the Prussian Junker background, were strongly anti-Polish and saw a war to regain Danzig and other lost eastern territories as justified. After the outbreak of World War II, resistance in the army became harder to contemplate since it could lead to the defeat of Germany. When Hitler decided to attack France soon after the Polish campaign in 1939, Halder along with other senior generals, thought it to be hopelessly unrealistic and again entertained the idea of a coup, urged by Oster and Canaris. When Hitler vowed to destroy the &quot;spirit of Zossen&quot; (the headquarters of the Army High Command), meaning defeatism, Halder feared that the conspiracy was about to be discovered and destroyed all incriminating documents.
Oster informed his friend Bert Sas, the Netherlands&#x27; military attaché in Berlin, more than twenty times the date of the postponed invasion of the Netherlands. Sas passed the information to his government but was not believed. Oster calculated that his treason could cost the lives of 40,000 German soldiers and wrestled with his decision. However, he then concluded that it was necessary to prevent millions of deaths that would occur in the protracted war after Germany was denied an early victory.

The period between 1940 and 1942 was the nadir of German resistance. Some officers were pleased to be wrong to have feared military disaster. Others still opposed Hitler and the Nazi regime but felt that his enormous popularity with the people made any action impossible. Tireless, Oster rebuilt a resistance network. In 1941, when the systematic extermination of European Jews began after the invasion of the Soviet Union, his &quot;Abwehr&quot; group established contact with the resistance group of Henning von Tresckow in Army Group Centre. In 1942, his most important recruit was General Friedrich Olbricht, head of the General Army Office, at the &quot;Bendlerblock&quot; in central Berlin, who controlled an independent system of communications to reserve units all over Germany. The Oster group supplied British-made bombs to Henning von Tresckow&#x27;s group for their attempts to assassinate Hitler in 1943.

In 1943, the &quot;Abwehr&quot; group&#x27;s rescue efforts for Jews were exposed by the &quot;Gestapo&quot; and Oster was dismissed from his post. Hans von Dohnanyi, who joined the &quot;Abwehr&quot; shortly before the war and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the Lutheran theologian and Dohnanyi&#x27;s brother-in-law, helped 14 Jews to flee to Switzerland disguised as &quot;Abwehr&quot; agents in Operation (&quot;Unternehmen&quot;) U-7. Dohnanyi and Bonhoeffer were arrested on charges of alleged breach of monetary exchange laws, amongst others, with the leading German insurance brokers Jauch &amp; Hübener, Captain Walter Jauch of the Jauch family, a first cousin-in-law of Oster, and Otto Hübener later being hanged. Oster was placed under house arrest.

==Death==
Oster was arrested the day after the failed 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler. On 4 April 1945, the diaries of Admiral Canaris were discovered and in a rage upon reading them, Hitler ordered that all current and past conspirators—Oster among them—be executed.

On 8 April 1945, Oster, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Wilhelm Canaris, and other anti-Nazis were convicted and sentenced to death by an SS drumhead court-martial presided over by Otto Thorbeck. At dawn the next day, Oster, Bonhoeffer and Canaris were hanged in the Flossenbürg concentration camp.

Fabian von Schlabrendorff, one of the few senior anti-Nazis to survive the war, described Oster as &quot;a man such as God meant men to be, lucid and serene in mind, imperturbable in danger&quot;.

<doc id="611404" wikidata="Q1435125" url="?curid=611404" title="Fetus in fetu">
<text>Fetus &quot;in fetu (orfoetus &quot;in foetu) is a rare developmental abnormality in which a mass of tissue resembling a fetus forms inside the body of its twin. An early example of the phenomenon was described in 1808 by George William Young.

There are two hypotheses for the origin of a fetus &quot;in fetu&quot;. One hypothesis is that the mass begins as a normal fetus but becomes enveloped inside its twin. The other hypothesis is that the mass is a highly developed teratoma. Fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.

== Classification as life ==
A fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; can be considered alive, but only in the sense that its component tissues have not yet died or been eliminated. Thus, the life of a fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; is akin to that of a tumor in that its cells remain viable by way of normal metabolic activity. However, without the gestational conditions &quot;in utero&quot; with the amnion and placenta, a fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; can develop into, at best, an especially well differentiated teratoma; or, at worst, a high-grade metastatic teratocarcinoma. In terms of physical maturation, its organs have a working blood supply from the host, but all cases of fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; present critical defects, such as no functional brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract. Accordingly, while a fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; can share select morphological features with a normal fetus, it has no prospect of any life outside of the host twin. Moreover, it poses clear threats to the life of the host twin on whom its own life depends.

== Hypotheses of development ==
There are two main hypotheses about the development of fetus &quot;in fetu&quot;.

=== Teratoma hypothesis ===

Fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; may be a very highly differentiated form of dermoid cyst, itself a highly differentiated form of mature teratoma.

=== Parasitic twin hypothesis ===

Fetus &quot;in fetu&quot; may be a parasitic twin fetus growing within its host twin. Very early in a monozygotic twin pregnancy, in which both fetuses share a common placenta, one fetus wraps around and envelops the other. The enveloped twin becomes a parasite, in that its survival depends on the survival of the host twin, by drawing on the host twin&#x27;s blood supply. The parasitic twin is anencephalic (without a brain) and lacks some internal organs, and as such is unable to survive on its own. As the host twin has to &quot;feed&quot; the enveloped twin from the nutrients received over a single umbilical cord, they usually die before birth.

<text>Axe (stylized as AXE) was an American hard rock band from Gainesville, Florida, formed in 1979 and disbanded in 2012. The band is best known for their 1982 song &quot;Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Party in the Streets&quot;, and had other hits such as &quot;Now or Never&quot;, &quot;I Think You&#x27;ll Remember Tonight&quot; and &quot;Heat in the Street&quot;.

== Biography==
Previously known as Babyface with a line-up of vocalist Edgar Riley, guitarist Bobby Barth, bassist Mike Turpin and drummer Bob Miles and managed by J. Brian Gendimenico (1962–2016), the group adopted the new title of Axe in 1979 when the band added second guitarist Michael Osborne. Signing with MCA Records, by manager Lou Manganiello Jr, Axe released their self-titled debut in 1979 and immediately gained attention with a melodic rock sound comprising heavy guitars mixed with keyboards. Band leader Bobby Barth had first picked up a guitar in 1965, encouraged by his father who was already an accomplished player, although Barth&#x27;s first interest had been in the drums. As a drummer Barth had made his first public appearance in 1963, but would not play in front of an audience in his new vocation until 1967 at a college gig in Colorado. Barth claims to have no recollections of the bands whose singles he played on early in his professional career, although does recall that his first vinyl appearance was covering a Rolling Stones song, before later forming Babyface.

The band was notable for being photographed on their first LP all sporting B. C. Rich guitars, one of the first bands to use them exclusively.

Following &quot;Axe&quot; with 1980&#x27;s &quot;Living On The Edge&quot; the group switched labels to Atco in 1982 for third album &quot;Offering&quot;, an album that included the hit anthem &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Party In The Streets&quot; and a cover of Montrose&#x27;s &quot;I Got The Fire&quot;. The album marked the addition of new bassist Wayne Haner to the ranks and AXE got to tour with Scorpions, Kiss, Judas Priest, Ozzy Osbourne and ZZ Top. The band also played in Britain during 1983 opening for Iron Maiden.

Following the arrival of the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Nemesis&quot; and touring with Mötley Crüe in 1984, AXE suffered a setback when guitarist Michael Osborne was killed in an auto crash in which a badly injured Bobby Barth was lucky enough to escape with his life. The band dissolved following the tragedy.

Barth, once recovered, joined Blackfoot, replacing the seasoned Ken Hensley after the release of the 1984 album &quot;Vertical Smiles&quot; and for the subsequent touring. The tenure was short lived however and Barth subsequently released a well crafted solo album &quot;Two Hearts, One Beat&quot; on Atco Records in 1986. In an attempt in 1989 at reforming AXE, including UFO drummer Andy Parker, was made but petered out, with Barth going to Australia in order to work with ex-Rose Tattoo frontman Angry Anderson.

Upon his return to America in 1991 the Denver, Colorado-based Caught in the Act came to his attention and, persuaded to take the band under his wing, Barth set to work producing demos. The ensuing debut album, which was eventually released on the Swedish Empire label and featuring covers of two AXE classics, &quot;Silent Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Steal Another Fantasy&quot;. Barth has continued to work with the group on a second record, although Caught in the Act has since had to revert to the C.I.T.A. handle due to the existence of a Dutch Boy band with prior claim to the name.

Due to Barth&#x27;s connections with the Japanese label Zero and German company MTM Music, he felt there was sufficient interest in AXE to make a renewed effort to put the group back together, albeit with a slightly revised line-up, and the release of a brand new album, aptly titled &quot;Five&quot;.

The reformed 1997 line up was former Frank Zappa vocalist Bob Harris, Barth on guitars, Edgar Riley Jr on keyboards and original drummer Teddy Mueller (born Ted J. Mueller on September 13, 1954) plus bassist Blake Eberhard, vocalist Bob Harris, and keyboardist Rob Lowe. Blake is one of Colorado&#x27;s premier studio and live bassists. He joined Axe after being hired by Barth for several recording sessions, and added the new dimension of fretless bass and slap-bass style to the Axe sound. In the interim period between the band&#x27;s split and the reformation, Edgar Riley Jr had worked with Frank Zappa and had also played with several unidentified bands in the Southern states of America and Teddy Mueller had got involved in the publishing industry.

A brand new AXE album, &quot;Axe (Twenty Years From Home)&quot; was released in September 1997 featuring re-recorded versions of choice tracks from each of the first four AXE albums, plus two from the recently released &quot;V&quot; record. For their 2001 album &quot;The Crown&quot; the group inducted new personnel guitarist Danny Masters and drummer Christian Teele. Masters had previously issued solo albums &quot;Electric Babylon&quot; and &quot;Till The Moon Goes Away&quot;. AXE would release a limited edition mini album &quot;Live In America 1981&quot; to commemorate their European 2001 tour dates. The same year would find Barth gaining production credits with Denver&#x27;s BLISTER 66.

Barth is also a member of Southern Rockers Red Rock Roosters releasing an album &quot;Attitude Is Everything&quot; in 1998. During 2003 Bob Harris re-emerged fronting the Edge of Forever project, an eighties Rock styled venture in union with keyboard player Alessandro Del Vecchio, bassist Christian Grillo and the Sleek, Gotthard and U.D.O. credited guitarist Igor Gianola.

In 2004, Barth rejoined Blackfoot.

Ted Mueller died on June 29, 2012, at the age of 57.

<text>Angel is an American rock band from Washington, D.C., formed in the mid-1970s by Punky Meadows, Mickey Jones, and Gregg Giuffria. They were primarily known for their flamboyant glam stage presence and white satin outfits.

== History ==
Angel was discovered by Kiss bass player Gene Simmons performing at a nightclub and was eventually signed to the same label as Kiss, Casablanca.

Angel&#x27;s image of dressing in all white was a deliberate contrast to Kiss, who wore black. Angel sported an androgynous image and elaborate stage sets. Frank Zappa wrote a satirical song about Punky Meadows, with Punky&#x27;s approval titled &quot;Punky&#x27;s Whips&quot;. Angel never achieved mass commercial success but acquired a following as a cult band.

Their first album was the self-titled &quot;Angel&quot; (1975) and consisted of guitarist Punky Meadows, bassist Mickie Jones, vocalist Frank DiMino, keyboardist Gregg Giuffria, and drummer Barry Brandt. This lineup would hold for the following two albums, &quot;Helluva Band&quot; (1976) and &quot;On Earth as It Is in Heaven&quot; (1977), after which Jones was replaced by Felix Robinson.

They made an appearance in the film &quot;Foxes&quot; (1980) and Frank DiMino sang &quot;Seduce Me Tonight&quot; and &quot;Blood From a Stone&quot; on the &quot;Flashdance&quot; (1983) soundtrack and &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1984) soundtrack, credited as Cycle V on both.

DiMino and Meadows departed the band in 1981, and the remaining members brought in vocalist Fergie Frederiksen (later of Toto) and guitarist Ricky Phillips (later of The Babys, then Bad English, then Styx), but this lineup did not release new material and it dissolved shortly thereafter.

The former members of Angel went on to other things following the release of their live album. Lead vocalist Frank DiMino joined UFO guitarist Paul Raymond in the Paul Raymond Project in which he sang lead vocals. Bassist Felix Robinson played on the debut album of the band White Lion, &quot;Fight to Survive&quot; (1985/1986). Angel&#x27;s keyboardist Gregg Giuffria had success as the leader of the band Giuffria during the 1980s as well as with the band House of Lords, who—sans Giuffria—reunited in 2002 and released a new album, &quot;The Power and the Myth&quot; on Frontiers Records. 

In the late 1990s, Angel reformed with a new line-up: Frank DiMino, vocals; Barry Brandt, drums; Randy Gregg, bass; Steve Blaze, guitars; and keyboardist Gordon G.G. Gebert. Gebert left the band in 2002 and was replaced with Michael T. Ross on keyboards. The band&#x27;s 1999 release &quot;In the Beginning&quot; also features guest appearances by original guitarist Punky Meadows, as well as Robinson. In 2000 came the release of &quot;Angel: The Collection&quot;, making it the most extensive Angel greatest hits compilation, including 16 songs.

In 2006, two compilations of career-spanning singles were released. &quot;Better Days&quot; from the &quot;White Hot&quot; (1977) album was notably replaced with &quot;The Winter Song&quot;. It had only been previously released on a rare 7&quot; single.

Bassist Mickie Jones (born Donald Eugene Jones on December 17, 1952, later changed to Michael David Jones in 1967), died in San Dimas, California on September 5, 2009, at the age of 56, after a long battle with liver cancer. Jones performed on four Angel albums (&quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Helluva Band&quot;, &quot;On Earth as It Is in Heaven&quot; and &quot;An Anthology&quot;). He toured extensively with the band in the United States for several years. Before Angel, he played in the rock group BUX, which included guitarist Punky Meadows (Angel) and singer Ralph Morman (Joe Perry Project, and Savoy Brown). BUX released one album on Capitol Records, &quot;We Came to Play&quot; in 1976 (recorded in 1973). Both Jones and Meadows were asked to join the New York Dolls but declined. After leaving Angel, he formed the Los Angeles band EMPIRE and was the lead singer. Empire included drummer Steve Riley (L.A. Guns). Over the years, he became interested in film production and would later work in the film industry.

Singer Frank DiMino now resides in Las Vegas, Nevada. He appeared on the Sin City Sinners Christmas album, singing lead vocals on the holiday classic &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;. In 2015 he released his solo album &quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot;, with Punky guesting on the song &#x27;Never Again&#x27;.

Punky Meadows issued his first-ever solo album in 2016, &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. Felix Robinson plays bass on the album. The deluxe edition had two bonus songs, one of which, &#x27;Lost and Lonely&#x27;, had Frank DiMino on vocals. Later Angel members Danny Farrow and Charlie Calv participate on this album as well.

In 2018, Meadows and DiMino toured together under the moniker &#x27;Punky Meadows and Frank DiMino of Angel&#x27; performing a set of classic Angel songs and solo cuts. They are backed by a band featuring Danny Farrow on rhythm guitar, Charlie Calv on keyboards, Steve Ojane on bass and Billy Orrico on drums.

In 2019, with the same lineup, the band reverted back to the name &quot;Angel&quot;—returning to wearing all white—and released a new album, &quot;Risen&quot;. The band returned with new music on the 2023 album &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.

Bassist Steve Ojane left the band at the end of 2023. Felix Robinson rejoined the band for select dates in 2024. Tommy Caradonna is announced as the new bass player.
