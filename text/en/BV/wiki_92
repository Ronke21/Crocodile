<text>Ommastrephidae is a family of squid containing three subfamilies, 11 genera, and over 20 species. They are widely distributed globally and are extensively fished for food. One species, &quot;Todarodes pacificus&quot;, comprised around half of the world&#x27;s cephalopod catch annually.

Some members of Ommastrephidae are known for their jet-propelled flight, earning them the common name of &quot;flying squid&quot;.

==Description==

The ommastrephids are small to large squids, with mantle lengths ranging from that of the glass squid (&quot;Hyaloteuthis pelagica&quot;) at , to the Humboldt squid (&quot;Dosidicus gigas&quot;) at . The mantle narrows towards the back and possesses large terminal fins. The family is characterized by an inverted T-shaped funnel locking cartilage. They have an easily recognizable, slender, feather-shaped gladius with a hollow cone structure (the primary conus). Light organs (photophores) are present along the head and mantle of members of the subfamily Ommastrephinae.
Ommastrephid arms have a double series of suckers. The enlarged tips (the clubs) of the tentacles have four rows of suckers, except in the genus &quot;Illex&quot;, which has eight. Hooks are absent. One of the ventral arms develops into a secondary sexual organ (the hectocotylus) in males.

All ommastrephids are active predators. Their arms and tentacles bear sharp teeth and are used to grasp and bring prey to their beaked mouths. They are very strong swimmers, and some species are known to glide out of water to escape predators.

Ommastrephid paralarvae are distinctive for having fused tentacles, looking like a single &quot;proboscis&quot;. It gradually splits into two as the paralarvae grow becoming completely separated once they reach mantle lengths of .

==Distribution and habitat==
Ommastrephids usually occur in pelagic waters, but can also be found in neritic habitats. They are found worldwide.

==Taxonomy==


Ommastrephidae was first established by the Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup in 1857. It is classified under the suborder Oegopsina of the order Teuthida (squids). It is divided into five subfamilies which are further subdivided into 11 genera and more than 20 species.

<text>Catering is the business of providing food services at a remote site or a site such as a hotel, hospital, pub, aircraft, cruise ship, park, festival, filming location or film studio.

==History of catering==
The earliest account of major services being catered in the United States was an event for William Howe of Philadelphia in 1778. The event served local foods that were a hit with the attendees, who eventually popularized catering as a career. The official industry began to be recognized around the 1820’s, with the caterers being disproportionately African-American. The catering business began to form around 1820, centered in Philadelphia.

===Robert Bogle===

The industry began to professionalize under the reigns of Robert Bogle who is recognized as &quot;the originator of catering.&quot; Catering was originally done by servants of wealthy elites. Butlers and house slaves, which were often black, were in a good position to become caterers. Essentially, caterers in the 1860s were &quot;public butlers&quot; as they organized and executed the food aspect of a social gathering. A public butler was a butler working for several households. Bogle took on the role of public butler and took advantage of the food service market in the hospitality field. 

Caterers like Bogle were involved with events likely to be catered today, such as weddings and funerals. Bogle also is credited with creating the Guild of Caterers and helping train other black caterers. This is important because catering provided not only jobs to black people but also opportunities to connect with elite members of Philadelphia society. Over time, the clientele of caterers became the middle class, who could not afford lavish gatherings and increasing competition from white caterers led to a decline in black catering businesses.

===Evolution of catering===

By the 1840s many restaurant owners began to combine catering services with their shops. Second-generation caterers grew the industry on the East Coast, becoming more widespread. Common usage of the word &quot;caterer&quot; came about in the 1880s at which point local directories began to use these term to describe the industry. White businessmen took over the industry by the 1900’s, with the Black Catering population disappearing.

In the 1930s, the Soviet Union, creating more simple menus, began developing state public catering establishments as part of its collectivization policies. A rationing system was implemented during World War II, and people became used to public catering. After the Second World War, many businessmen embraced catering as an alternative way of staying in business after the war. By the 1960s, the home-made food was overtaken by eating in public catering establishments.

By the 2000s, personal chef services started gaining popularity, with more women entering the workforce. People between 15 and 24 years of age spent as little as 11–17 minutes daily on food preparation and clean-up activities in 2006-2016, according to figures revealed by the American Time Use Survey conducted by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. There are many types of catering, including Event catering, Wedding Catering and Corporate Catering.

==Event catering==

An event caterer serves food at indoor and outdoor events, including corporate and workplace events and parties at home and venues. 

==Mobile catering==
A mobile caterer serves food directly from a vehicle, cart or truck which is designed for the purpose. Mobile catering is common at outdoor events such as concerts, s, and downtown business districts. Mobile catering services require less maintenance costs when compared with other catering services. Mobile caterers may also be known as food trucks in some areas. Mobile catering is popular throughout New York City, though sometimes can be unprofitable. Ice cream vans are a familiar example of a catering truck in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.

==Seat-back catering==
Seat-back catering was a service offered by some charter airlines in the United Kingdom (e.g., Court Line, which introduced the idea in the early 1970s, and Dan-Air) that involved embedding two meals in a single seat-back tray. &quot;One helping was intended for each leg of a charter flight, but Alan Murray, of Viking Aviation, had earlier revealed that &#x27;with the ingenious use of a nail file or coin, one could open the inbound meal and have seconds&#x27;. The intention of participating airlines was to &quot;save money, reduce congestion in the cabin and give punters the chance to decide when to eat their meal&quot;. By requiring less galley space on board, the planes could offer more passenger seats.

According to &quot;TravelUpdate&quot;″s columnist, &quot;The Flight Detective&quot;, &quot;Salads and sandwiches were the usual staples,&quot; and &quot;a small pellet of dry ice was put into the compartment for the return meal to try to keep it fresh.&quot; However, in addition to the fact that passengers on one leg were able to consume the food intended for other passengers on the following leg, there was a &quot;food hygiene&quot; problem, and the concept was discontinued by 1975.

==Canapé catering==

A canapé caterer serves canapés at events. They have become a popular type of food at events, Christmas parties and weddings. A canapé is a type of hors d&#x27;oeuvre, a small, prepared, and often decorative food, consisting of a small piece of bread or pastry. They should be easier to pick up and not be bigger than one or two bites. The bite-sized food is usually served before the starter or main course or alone with drinks at a drinks party.

==Wedding catering==
A wedding caterer provides food for a wedding reception and party, traditionally called a wedding breakfast. A wedding caterer can be hired independently or can be part of a package designed by the venue. Catering service providers are often skilled and experienced in preparing and serving high-quality cuisine. They offer a diverse and rich selection of food, creating a great experience for their customers. There are many different types of wedding caterers, each with their approach to food.
==Shipboard catering==
Merchant ships – especially ferries, cruise liners, and large cargo ships – often carry Catering Officers. In fact, the term &quot;catering&quot; was in use in the world of the merchant marine long before it became established as a land-bound business.

<doc id="631103" wikidata="Q559382" url="?curid=631103" title="Roger de Moulins">
<text>Roger de Moulins was the eighth Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller from 1177 until his death in 1187. He succeeded Jobert of Syria. His successors were two interim masters, William Borrel and then Armengol de Aspa, before the permanent Grand Master Garnier of Nablus was selected in 1190.

== Biography ==
Roger de Moulins was little known to history before his elevation to the magistracy of the Order. He may have been a Norman knight from Moulins, but there is no proof of that. His first concern, after his installation in the Holy Land, was to urge Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and the principal lords of the kingdom to continue the war against Saladin with vigor. On 25 November 1177, he participated in the Battle of Montgisard, winning &quot;the most beautiful victory of the crusades&quot; against the Ayyubids. Saladin&#x27;s defeat is regarded as so severe that it was only redeemed by his victory ten years later at the Battle of Hattin in 1187.

The Hospitallers formed one of the strongest military organizations of the kingdom, but this was contrary to the spirit of the Order, distancing them from the works of hospitality for which it had been founded. Pope Alexander III called them back to the observance of the rule of Raymond du Puy between 1178 and 1180, issuing a bull that forbade them to take up arms unless they were attacked and urged them not to abandon the care of those sick and in poverty. 

The Hospitallers were clear rivals of the Knights Templar. Alexander III persuaded Roger de Moulins to make a truce in 1179 with Odo de St Amand, then Grand Master and also a veteran of Montgisard. The pope instituted an arbitration process. Three brothers from each order were chosen as arbiters, each of whom had the right to appoint two other brothers. If the arbitration was insufficient, the friars were to call upon persons outside the orders. If there was still a disagreement, the matter would be submitted in the last resort to the two Grand Masters. The agreement with the Templars was not a good one. They were in constant conflict over their rights and possessions.

On one point, the Templars and the Hospitallers were in perfect agreement. The grievances that diocesan authority harbored against the privileges of the orders. The secular clergy did not accept the immunities and privileges that the two orders held from the Holy See. In March 1179, the prelates appealed to the Third Lateran Council, which reformed the abuses and forbade the orders to receive churches and tithes from the laity without the agreement of the diocesan authority, and cancelled the recent &quot;moderno temporen&quot; donations. This decision, while reforming the abuses, left the privileges of the orders intact. Vexed, the clergy redoubled their attacks and it took two papal bulls, 26 August 1180 and 14 August 1182, to bring the clergy back to respecting the decisions of the council, as well as the persons and property of the Hospitallers, and prescribing the excommunication of anyone who would attack the Hospitallers and the Templars with an armed hand.

In 1184, he toured Europe with Arnold of Torroja, the Grand Master of the Templars, and Heraclius, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. One objective was to plead with kings and pope Lucius III to send a new crusade to strengthen the Latin states in the East, which were at the mercy of the growing power of Saladin and established the Hospitaller Order in England, France and Germany. On his way back he helped the Kingdom of Sicily attack Thessalonica in 1185. In his time, he established the tradition of the Grand Master of the Hospitallers involvement in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. After the death of Baldwin V of Jerusalem in August 1186, Roger ended up at conflict with Gerard de Ridefort, Arnold&#x27;s successor as Grand Master, and with Raynald de Châtillon due to his having opposed Guy of Lusignan - he at first refused to hand over his key to the royal treasury when Guy was crowned King of Jerusalem in 1186.

== The Battle of Cresson ==
At the end of 1186, Raynald de Châtillon, in defiance of the truce with Saladin, had captured a caravan going from Cairo to Damascus with the sister of the emir. The barons, gathered in Jerusalem by Guy de Lusignan, on 27 March 1187, had demanded that before anything else a reconciliation take place between Lusignan and Raymond III of Tripoli. The masters of the Templars and Hospitallers, Joscius, the archbishop of Tyre, Balian of Ibelin, lord of Nablus, and Renaud Grenier, lord of Sidon, were appointed to negotiate with the count of Tripoli in Tiberias when they had to face Muslim troops. A victim of the foolish pride of Gerard de Ridefort, Roger took part in the Battle of Cresson against Saladin near Nazareth on 1 May 1187, where he was killed by a spear wound. Roger was succeeded by William Borrel, who served as custodian of the Hospitallers for a brief time in 1187, and then by Armengol de Aspa, who served as &quot;provisor&quot; (custodian) until 1190. A new Grand Master was not chosen until Garnier of Nablus was elected in 1190 during the Third Crusade. 

== The status of the Order ==
On 14 March 1182, the new statutes of the Hospitaller under the leadership of Roger de Moulins marked an essential turning point for the Order on several points. In the spiritual domain, as early as 21 October 1154, a category of brother priests or chaplains was established, granted by pope Anastasius IV. In the hospital and military domain, it was not until these statutes that doctors and surgeons appeared among the Order&#x27;s medical personnel. And in the military field, brothers in arms (noted for the first time in a text, even though they already existed in practice): &quot;It was on this date, therefore, that the order became, in law, a religious-military order.&quot; It was also specified that on the death of a brother, a mass will be dedicated to it in addition to the daily mass, and that &quot;the brothers&#x27; biers, and be covered with a red sheet with white cross.

These are the only statutes to mention charity in a normative text. Three articles refer to it, all of them dealing with the reception and care of the sick: (1) To welcome thirty poor people at table each day; (2) To give alms to all those who come to the door of the establishment three days a week; and, (3_Wash the feet of thirteen poor people on the Saturday of Lent, and provide them with new clothes and shoes. Roger was the originator of the bull issued on 22 August 1185, &quot;Quanto per gratiam Dei&quot;, and it was this one that officially made the Order a charitable order. These are the ones that give the most information about care. Whether it be on the full-time recruitment (in the hospital or on the battlefield) and binding by oath of the four physicians and four surgeons employed by the Order, &quot;because of the scientific and practical deficiency of the friars.&quot; The only normative texts which give an account of the reception of all pregnant women in a specific room, and of the future of abandoned children, whom the hospital must then provide for and feed.

<text>Shennong (), variously translated as &quot;Divine Farmer&quot; or &quot;Divine Husbandman&quot;, born Jiang Shinian (), was a mythological Chinese ruler known as the first Yan Emperor who has become a deity in Chinese and Vietnamese folk religion. He is venerated as a culture hero in China and Vietnam. In Vietnamese, he is referred to as Thần Nông.

Shennong has at times been counted amongst the Three Sovereigns (also known as &quot;Three Kings&quot; or &quot;Three Patrons&quot;), a group of ancient deities or deified kings of prehistoric China. Shennong has been thought to have taught the ancient Chinese not only their practices of agriculture, but also the use of herbal medicine. Shennong was credited with various inventions: these include the hoe, plow (both &quot;leisi&quot; () style and the plowshare), axe, digging wells, agricultural irrigation, preserving stored seeds by using boiled horse urine (to ward off the borers), trade, commerce, money, the weekly farmers market, the Chinese calendar (especially the division into the 24 &quot;jieqi&quot; or solar terms), and to have refined the therapeutic understanding of taking pulse measurements, acupuncture, and moxibustion, and to have instituted the harvest thanksgiving ceremony (&quot;zhaji (蜡祭)&quot; sacrificial rite, later known as the &quot;laji (腊祭)&quot; rite).

&quot;Shennong&quot; can also be taken to refer to his people, the &quot;Shennong-shi&quot; ().

==Mythology==
In Chinese mythology, Shennong taught humans the use of the plow, aspects of basic agriculture, and the use of cannabis. Possibly influenced by the Yan Emperor mythos or the use of slash-and-burn agriculture, Shennong was a god of burning wind. He was also sometimes said to be a progenitor to, or to have had as one of his ministers, Chiyou (and like him, was ox-headed, sharp-horned, bronze-foreheaded, and iron-skulled).

Shennong is also thought to be the father of the Huang Emperor () who carried on the secrets of medicine, immortality, and making gold. According to the eighth century AD historian Sima Zhen&#x27;s commentary to the second century BC Shiji (or, &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot;), Shennong is a kinsman of the Yellow Emperor and is said to be an ancestor, or a patriarch, of the ancient forebears of the Chinese.

After the Zhou dynasty, Shennong was thought to have existed within it by some &quot;ancient Chinese historians&quot; and religious practitioners as the &quot;deified&quot; form of &quot;mythical wise king&quot; Hou Ji whose descendants later founded the Zhou.

As an alternative to this view, Shennong was also thought of in the era of the Hundred Schools of Thought as a culture hero rather than a god, but one with a supernatural digestive system who ate a specimen of every single plant that existed in the time of the Hundred Schools to find which ones were edible by humans. In the third century BCE, during times of political crisis and expansionism and wars among Chinese kingdoms, Shennong received new myths about his status as an ideal prehistoric ruler who valued laborers and farmers and &quot;ruled without ministers, laws or punishments.&quot;

==In literature==
Sima Qian () mentioned that the rulers directly preceding the Yellow Emperor were of the house (or societal group) of Shennong. Sima Zhen, who added a prologue for the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; (), said his surname was Jiang (), and proceeded to list his successors. An older and more famous reference is in the &quot;Huainanzi&quot;; it tells how, prior to Shennong, people were sickly, wanting, starved and diseased; but he then taught them agriculture, which he himself had researched, eating hundreds of plants — and even consuming seventy poisons in one day. Shennong also features in the book popularly known in English as &quot;I Ching&quot;. Here, he is referenced as coming to power after the end of the house (or reign) of Paoxi (Fu Xi), also inventing a bent-wood plow, a cut-wood rake, teaching these skills to others, and establishing a noonday market. Another reference is in the &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;, mentioning some violence with regard to the rise of the Shennong house, and that their power lasted seventeen generations.

The &quot;Shénnóng Běn Cǎo Jīng&quot; is a book on agriculture and medicinal plants, attributed to Shennong. Research suggests that it is a compilation of oral traditions, written between about 200 and 250 AD.

==Historicity==

Reliable information on the history of China before the 13th century BC can come only from archaeological evidence because China&#x27;s first established written system on a durable medium, the oracle bone script, did not exist until then. Thus, the concrete existence of even the Xia dynasty, said to be the successor to Shennong, is yet to be proven, despite efforts by Chinese archaeologists to link that dynasty with Bronze Age Erlitou archaeological sites.

However, Shennong, both the individual and the clan, are very important in Chinese cultural history, especially in regards to mythology and popular culture. Indeed, Shennong figures extensively in historical literature.

==Popular religion==

According to some versions of the myths about Shennong, he eventually died as a result of his researches into the properties of plants by experimenting upon his own body, after, in one of his tests, he ate the yellow flower of a weed that caused his intestines to rupture before he had time to swallow his antidotal tea: having thus given his life for humanity, he has since received special honor through his worship as the Medicine King ( &quot;Yàowáng&quot;). The sacrifice of cows or oxen to Shennong in his various manifestations is never at all appropriate; instead pigs and sheep are acceptable. Fireworks and incense may also be used, especially at the appearance of his statue on his birthday, lunar April 26, according to popular tradition. Under his various names, Shennong is the patron deity of farmers, rice traders, and practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine. Many temples and other places dedicated to his commemoration exist.

==Popular culture==

As noted above, Shennong is said in the &quot;Huainanzi&quot; to have tasted hundreds of herbs to test their medical value. The most well-known work attributed to Shennong is &quot;The Divine Farmer&#x27;s Herb-Root Classic&quot; (), first compiled some time during the end of the Western Han Dynasty — several thousand years after Shennong might have existed. This work lists the various medicinal herbs, such as &quot;lingzhi&quot;,and marijuana that were discovered by Shennong and given grade and rarity ratings. It is considered to be the earliest Chinese pharmacopoeia, and includes 365 medicines derived from minerals, plants, and animals. Shennong is credited with identifying hundreds of medical (and poisonous) herbs by personally testing their properties, which was crucial to the development of traditional Chinese medicine. Legend holds that Shennong had a transparent body, and thus could see the effects of different plants and herbs on himself. He is also said to have discovered tea, which he found it to be acting as an antidote against the poisonous effects of some seventy herbs he tested on his body. Shennong first tasted it, traditionally in ca. 2437 BC, from tea leaves on burning tea twigs, after they were carried up from the fire by the hot air, landing in his cauldron of boiling water. Shennong is venerated as the Father of Chinese medicine. He is also believed to have introduced the technique of acupuncture.

Shennong is said to have played a part in the creation of the guqin, together with Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor. Scholarly works mention that the paternal family of famous Song dynasty General Yue Fei traced their origins back to Shennong.

==Places==
Shennong is associated with certain geographic localities including Shennongjia, in Hubei, where the Calamoideae ladder which he used to climb the local mountain range is supposed to have transformed into a vast forest. The Shennong Stream flows from here into the Yangtze River.

<text>Launched in 1759, the third &quot;Supply&quot; was a Royal Navy armed tender that played an important part in the foundation of the Colony of New South Wales. The Navy sold her in 1792. She then served commercially until about 1806.

HMAT &quot;Supply&quot; (1759) is not to be confused with the replacement vessel , a 10-gun storeship, of 388 tons (bm), originally the American mercantile &quot;New Brunswick&quot;, which the Admiralty purchased in 1793 as an armed vessel for the colony at Port Jackson and was broken up there in 1806.

== Construction ==
&quot;Supply&quot; was designed in 1759 by shipwright Thomas Slade, as a yard craft for the ferrying of naval supplies. Construction was contracted to Henry Bird of Rotherhithe, for a vessel measuring 168 tons (bm) to be built in four months at £8.80 per ton. In practice, construction took about five months from the laying of the keel on 1 May 1759 to launch on 5 October. As built, the vessel was also larger than designed, measuring 174 tons (bm) and with a length overall of , a beam of , and a hold depth of .

Rigged as a brig, she had two masts, and was fitted with four small 3-pounder cannons and six -pounder swivel guns. Her armament was substantially increased in 1786 with the addition of four 12-pounder carronades.

Her initial complement was 14 men, rising to 55 when converted to an armed tender for the First Fleet voyage in 1788.

==Service history==

===Naval service===
&quot;Supply&quot; was used to transport naval supplies between the Thames and Channel ports from 1759 to 1786. Throughout this period, she was based at Deptford Dockyard, undergoing minor repairs as required to maintain seaworthiness.

As one of 2 Royal Navy escorts to the First Fleet, she left Spithead on 13 May 1787 and was the first to arrive in Botany Bay on 18 January 1788, as recorded in the journals of William Bradley and John Hunter of HMS &quot;Sirius&quot;, which arrived on 20 January. &quot;Supply&quot; was under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip (who had transferred from &quot;Sirius&quot; at Cape Town). She was captained by Henry Lidgbird Ball, the master was David Blackburn, and the surgeon was James Callam. &quot;Supply&quot; was also the first ship to sail into Port Jackson after the original Botany Bay landing was found unsuitable for settlement.

After the establishment of the initial settlement at Port Jackson, &quot;Supply&quot; was the link between the colony and Norfolk Island, making 10 trips. Following the loss of &quot;Sirius&quot; in 1790, she became the colony&#x27;s only link with the outside world. On 17 April 1790, she was sent to Batavia for supplies, returning on 19 September, her captain having chartered a Dutch vessel, &quot;Waakzaamheid&quot;, to follow with more stores.

&quot;Supply&quot; left Port Jackson on 26 November 1791 and sailed via Cape Horn, reaching Plymouth on 21 April 1792.

A number of David Blackburn&#x27;s letters to family and friends have survived. These letters describe the events of the voyage and the early days of settlement, including Blackburn&#x27;s participation in the expedition to Norfolk Island to establish a settlement there in February 1788.

===Later service===
The Admiralty sold her at auction in July 1792 and her new owners renamed her &quot;Thomas and Nancy&quot;. She then carried coal in the Thames area until 1806.

The Admiralty in October 1793 purchased the American mercantile ship &quot;New Brunswick&quot;, named her , and sent her out to New South Wales to replace her predecessor.

==Postscript==
A New South Wales Urban Transit Authority First Fleet ferry was named after &quot;Supply&quot; in 1984.

<text>Jean Mueller (born 1950) is an American astronomer and discoverer of comets, minor planets, and a large number of supernovas at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California.

== Scientific career ==

In 1983, she became the first woman to operate the historic Hooker telescope at Mt. Wilson Observatory and was the first woman hired as a telescope operator at Palomar Observatory in 1985.

The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II) got under way in August 1985, with the first of the 14&quot; photographic glass plates being pulled off the Palomar&#x27;s Samuel Oschin telescope (then called the 48-inch Schmidt Camera). Jean Mueller was hired as the &quot;48-Inch Night Assistant&quot; in July of that year, and worked in the capacity as observer and telescope operator for the duration. She took over 5500 photographic plates and had the honor of setting the telescope and removing the final plate from the historic Schmidt Camera on June 3, 2000, as well as discovering her last supernova, 2000cm, on that same night.

Jean Mueller spent hundreds of hours (in her spare time) scanning POSS II plates under high magnification looking for comets, fast-moving asteroids, and supernovae on an X/Y stage that held the 1 mm thick glass plates. Mueller would sometimes mark over a hundred galaxies recorded on a single POSS II plate to hunt for supernova candidates. She would then compare these plates with the first Palomar Sky Survey (POSS I) of similar fields. It was during the years of the POSS II project that Jean Mueller made all of her discoveries.

== Discoveries ==


Working at Palomar Observatory, she discovered a total of 15 comets, including 7 periodic comets 120P/Mueller, 131P/Mueller, 136P/Mueller, 149P/Mueller, 173P/Mueller, 188P/LINEAR-Mueller, 190P/Mueller, and 8 non-periodic comets.

She is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 13 numbered minor planets during 1987–1993, including several near-Earth objects such as the Apollo asteroids 4257 Ubasti, 9162 Kwiila, and 12711 Tukmit and the Amor asteroid 6569 Ondaatje.

Mueller also discovered 107 (9 listed as co-discoveries) supernovae.

== Honors ==

The inner main-belt asteroid of the Hungaria family, 4031 Mueller, was named in honor of Jean Mueller for her astronomical discoveries. Discovered on February 12, 1985, by Carolyn Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory with the 18&quot; Schmidt Camera, it was originally designated . The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 12 December 1989 ().

<text>Viana is a municipality in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. It is located 18 km southwest of Vitória on the road to Minas Gerais. Its population was 79,500 (2020) and its area is 312 km2. Though it is part of the Greater Vitória metropolitan area, it still maintains a much more laid-back feeling. Marked by its first church dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Conceição (built on March 22, 1817) atop a little mound in the middle of the town all those who pass it on their way to and from Minas Gerais appreciate its imposing landmark. The town also has a railway museum at the railway station inaugurated on 13 July 1895 by the English. The municipality borders Vitória (E), Cariacica (N), Domingos Martins (W) and Guarapari (S).

==History==
In 1846, 39 families from North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate (then known as &quot;Rheinpreussen&quot; in German, or &quot;Prússia Renana&quot; in Portuguese) arrived at Vitória on 21 December to settle what is now Viana, as this was the first allotted land they received from the government. In 1857, though, most of them moved on to found Santa Isabel Colony on 27 January 1857.

In the 1890s, Viana was a prosperous colony of mainly Azorean immigrants. In 1891 Santa Isabel became a municipality independent from Viana in what used to be its mountainous region. In 1961, the city was made the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Viana.

<doc id="631126" wikidata="Q6089850" url="?curid=631126" title="Michael Malloy">
<text>Michael Malloy (1873 – February 22, 1933), nicknamed Mike the Durable or Iron Mike, was a homeless Irishman from County Donegal who lived in New York City during the 1920s and 1930s. A former firefighter and stationary engineer, he was murdered by a group of five acquaintances after multiple failed attempts on his life by the men to perpetrate life insurance fraud.

==Background==

Beginning in January 1933, while Malloy was unemployed, alcoholic, and homeless, five of his acquaintances Tony Marino, Joseph &quot;Red&quot; Murphy, Francis Pasqua, Hershey Green, and Daniel Kriesberg (later dubbed &quot;the Murder Trust&quot; by the media) plotted to kill Malloy by getting him to drink himself to death to collect life insurance. Presumably achieved with the aid of a corrupt insurance agent, they obtained insurance policies on Malloy&#x27;s life under the name Nicholas Mellory and stood to gain over () if Malloy died an accidental death.

==Failed murder attempts==
Tony Marino owned a speakeasy and gave Malloy an unlimited tab, thinking the alcoholic Malloy would abuse it and drink himself to death. Although Malloy drank for a majority of his waking day, it did not kill him. Marino then added antifreeze to Malloy&#x27;s liquor, but Malloy would continue to drink with no problems. A possible explanation for the antifreeze not killing him is the fact that ethanol blocks absorption of ethylene glycol in the liver (and is used as one possible antidote for antifreeze poisoning). Antifreeze was replaced with turpentine, followed by horse liniment, and finally rat poison was mixed in. After these mixtures failed to kill Malloy, Marino mixed shots of wood alcohol (pure methanol) in with his normal shots of liquor. This did not kill Malloy, presumably because the normal liquor helped negate the methanol poisoning.

The group then gave Malloy raw oysters soaked in wood alcohol – the idea apparently coming from Pasqua, who claimed he saw a man die after eating oysters with whiskey. A sandwich of spoiled sardines mixed with poison and carpet tacks was then tried.

Concluding that it was unlikely that anything Malloy ingested was going to kill him quickly enough before the insurance policies ran out, the group decided to freeze him to death. On an extremely cold night, after Malloy drank until passing out, he was carried to a park, dumped in the snow, and had of water poured on his bare chest. However, shortly thereafter, Malloy was rescued by police who took him to a homeless charity where he was re-clothed.

The group then attempted to kill Malloy by running him down with Green&#x27;s taxi, moving at . This put Malloy in the hospital for three weeks with broken bones. The group presumed he was dead, but they were unable to collect the policy on him.

==Murder and legal proceedings==
On February 22, 1933, after he had passed out for the night, the conspirators took Malloy to Murphy&#x27;s room, put a hose in his mouth that was connected to the coal gas jet, and turned it on. This finally killed Malloy, with his death occurring within an hour. He was pronounced dead of lobar pneumonia and quickly buried, with Dr. Frank Manzella signing the death certificate. Police heard rumors of &quot;Mike the Durable&quot; in speakeasies around the town, and upon learning that Michael Malloy had died that night, they had the body exhumed and forensically examined.

The five men were put on trial and subsequently convicted. Dr. Manzella was held as an accessory after the fact with a bail (), but was ultimately convicted of a misdemeanor in &quot;failing to report a suspicious death to the police and Medical Examiner&quot;. Green was convicted of attempted murder with a prison sentence of a minimum of 10 years, while the other four accomplices were sentenced to death and were executed by electric chair at Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Kriesberg, Marino, and Pasqua were executed on June 7, 1934, and Murphy was executed on July 5, 1934.

<doc id="631130" wikidata="Q432525" url="?curid=631130" title="Latria">
<text>Latria or latreia (also known as latreutical worship) is a theological term (Latin &quot;Latrīa&quot;, from the Greek , &quot;latreia&quot;) used in Catholic theology and Eastern Orthodox theology to mean adoration, a reverence directed only to the Holy Trinity. Latria carries an emphasis on the internal form of worship, rather than external ceremonies. Christians took the Greek word , present in the Septuagint, into their practice of worship. &quot;Latreia,&quot; in Greek, means &#x27;service&#x27;, or &#x27;being in a condition of servitude&#x27;. Thus, Christian ministers render service unto God. This Divine Service is worship.

==Eucharist==
Latria also applies to the Eucharist and Eucharistic adoration. In the 16th century, the Council of Trent made specific affirmations of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist and the theological basis for Eucharistic adoration and stated:
&quot;The only-begotten Son of God is to be adored in the Holy
Sacrament of the Eucharist with the worship of &quot;latria&quot;, including
external worship.
Pope Paul VI&#x27;s 1965 encyclical &quot;Mysterium fidei&quot;: also affirmed this belief and in items 56 stated:&quot;The Catholic Church has always displayed and still displays this latria that ought to be paid to the Sacrament of the Eucharist, both during Mass and outside of it&quot;.

==Latria, hyperdulia, protodulia and dulia==

&quot;Latria&quot; or &quot;Adoration&quot; is sacrificial in character, and may be offered only to God. Catholic and Orthodox Christians offer other degrees of reverence to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph, John the Baptist, and to the other saints; these non-sacrificial types of reverence are called &quot;hyperdulia&quot;, &quot;protodulia&quot; and &quot;dulia&quot;, respectively. In English, dulia is also called &quot;veneration&quot;. Hyperdulia is essentially a heightened degree of dulia provided only to the Blessed Virgin.

This distinction, written about as early as Augustine of Hippo and St Jerome, was detailed more explicitly by Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologiae, A.D. 1270: &quot;Reverence is due to God on account of His Excellence, which is communicated to certain creatures not in equal measure, but according to a measure of proportion; and so the reverence which we pay to God, and which belongs to latria, differs from the reverence which we pay to certain excellent creatures; this belongs to dulia, and we shall speak of it further on (103)&quot;; in this next article St. Thomas Aquinas writes: &quot;Wherefore dulia, which pays due service to a human lord, is a distinct virtue from latria, which pays due service to the Lordship of God. It is, moreover, a species of observance, because by observance we honor all those who excel in dignity, while dulia properly speaking is the reverence of servants for their master, dulia being the Greek for servitude&quot;.

== Protestant critique of dulia ==
New Testament scholar James Dunn discusses the tradition of Catholic dulia in Augustine and Aquinas, mentioning that the new testament&#x27;s use of δουλεία (pronounced dulia) is always used negatively. He states:&quot;douleia occurs only in the sense of &#x27;slavery, servility&#x27;, and always in a negative sense – the slavery to physical corruption (Rom. 8.21), slavery to the law (Gal. 5.1), slavery to the fear of death (Heb. 2.15).&quot;Bill Mounce overviews New Testament use of δουλεία with the following chart:
==Linguistic distinctions in English==

The word &quot;worship&quot; is derived from the West Saxon dialect noun &quot;weorðscipe&quot; &#x27;condition of being worthy&#x27;, which is from &quot;weorð&quot; &#x27;worthy&#x27; + &quot;-scipe&quot; &#x27;-ship&#x27;. The word &quot;worship&quot; is used in a strong sense in relation to God (&quot;latria&quot;), but also in a weak sense in relation to man: for instance, &quot;His Worship the Mayor&quot;, or &quot;Your Worship&quot; (when addressing a magistrate in Court), or the worship of the saints (&quot;dulia&quot;) as distinct to the adoration of God (&quot;latria&quot;). &quot;Adoration&quot; provides a clear and unequivocal, and therefore better, translation of &quot;latria&quot; and expression of the absolute sacrificial reverence due to God alone.

&quot;This worship called forth by God, and given exclusively to Him as God, is designated by the Greek name &quot;latreia&quot; (Latinized, &quot;latria&quot;), for which the best translation that our language affords is the word &quot;Adoration&quot;. Adoration is different from other acts of worship, such as supplication, confession of sin, etc., inasmuch as it formally consists in self-abasement before the Infinite, and in devout recognition of His transcendent excellence.&quot;

Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christians especially adore with &quot;latria&quot; during their religious service, the Mass or Divine Liturgy. Catholics consider themselves to literally participate in the sacrifice at the foot of Calvary, that what Christ offered once &quot;participates in the divine eternity&quot;, while Methodists teach that Holy Communion is a type of sacrifice that re-presents the sacrifice of Christ on the Cross; with regard to the Eucharist, the Methodist Churches further teach that:
 A formal statement by the USCCB affirms that &quot;Methodists and Catholics agree that the sacrificial language of the Eucharistic celebration refers to &#x27;the sacrifice of Christ once-for-all,&#x27; to &#x27;our pleading of that sacrifice here and now,&#x27; to &#x27;our offering of the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving,&#x27; and to &#x27;our sacrifice of ourselves in union with Christ who offered himself to the Father.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Machelen, or in full Machelen-aan-de-Leie, is a village in the municipality of Zulte in the province of East Flanders of Belgium. It was the hometown of the painter Roger Raveel.

==History==
Machelen was first mentioned in 697 as Machlinio. In the 11th century, the village belonged to the Lords of Oudenaarde. The Sint-Michiel-en-Cornelius-en-Ghislenus Church was first mentioned in 1163. In the 17th century, the church became a site of pilgrimage and was greatly extended. In 1914, the tower which was damaged in the 19th century, was repaired, only to be destroyed again in 1918. It was subsequently repaired in 1920.

Machelen was an independent municipality until 1977 when it merged into Zulte. The Roger Raveel Museum is located in the village.

==Notable people==
* Roger Raveel (1921–2013), painter associated with pop art.
* Gerard Reve (1923–2006), author buried in Machelen.

<text>London West () is a federal electoral district in London, Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1968.

==Geography==
The district includes the northwest part of the City of London.

In 2003, it was defined to consist of the part of the city lying north and west of a line drawn from the western limit of the city along Dingman Creek, Southdale Road West, Wharncliffe Road South, Commissioners Road East, the Canadian National Railway, the Thames River, Wharncliffe Road North, Oxford Street West and Wonderland Road North.

==History==

The electoral district was created in 1966 from London, Middlesex East, and from Middlesex West.

It initially consisted of the part of the City of London west of a line drawn from north to south along Adelaide Street, Dundas Street, Wellington Street and Wellington Road.

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city west of a line drawn from south to north along Southdale Road, Wellington Road, the Thames River and the North Thames River, Dundas Street, Colborne Street, Huron Street and Richmond Street.

In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city lying north and west of a line drawn from the southern limit of the city along Wharncliffe Road South, Commissioners Road East, Wellington Road, the Thames River, the North Thames River, the Medway River, Western Road and Richmond Street.

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city lying north and west of a line drawn from the western limit of the city along Dingman Creek, Southdale Road West, Wharncliffe Road South, Commissioners Road East, the London and Port Stanley Electric Railway, the Thames River, Wharncliffe Road, Oxford Street, Wonderland Road North and Hutton Road.

In 2003, it was given its current boundaries as described above.

This riding lost territory to London North Centre during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will lose the neighbourhoods of South London and Highland north of Commissioners Road to the new riding of London Centre, and will lose the area north of Fanshawe Park Road to Middlesex—London. These changes will come into effect upon the calling of the 2025 Canadian federal election.

<doc id="631145" wikidata="Q5229109" url="?curid=631145" title="Dave Kingman">
<text>David Arthur Kingman (born December 21, 1948), nicknamed &quot;Kong&quot;, &quot;King Kong&quot;, and &quot;Sky King&quot;, is an American former Major League Baseball left fielder, first baseman, third baseman, and designated hitter who was a three-time MLB All-Star with 442 career home runs and 1,210 runs batted in (RBI) in 16 seasons. In his career, Kingman averaged a home run every 15.11 at bats, tied for 14th best all-time.

The 6&#x27; 6&quot; Kingman was a power hitter, who twice led the National League in home runs. Known for his long home runs, Kingman hit one measured at over 530 feet. Kingman struck out frequently, and posted a low batting average and on-base percentage. His 1,816 strikeouts was the fourth-highest total in MLB history at the time of his retirement. Kingman finished in the top 25 voting for National League Most Valuable Player four times (1972, 1975, 1976, and 1979) and American League Most Valuable Player once (1984).
Upon retiring, Dave Kingman was 16th on the all-time home run list and tied for 4th on the all-time grand slam list with 16 (tied with Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth).

==Early life==
Kingman was born in Pendleton, Oregon, in 1948, and moved with his family to Denver, Colorado, in 1951, then to Los Angeles, California, in 1954, and finally to Mount Prospect, Illinois. Kingman&#x27;s father worked for United Airlines and moved the family as needed for his career. Kingman attended Prospect High School, where he was a center and a forward on the basketball team, being named All-Area; a wide receiver and safety on the football team; and a star pitcher on the baseball team. Kingman threw a no-hitter against Niles North High School on April 6, 1967. In his final high school game, he hit four home runs and pitched a two-hit shutout.

==Amateur career==
Kingman was drafted by the California Angels out of high school in the second round of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft. Instead he chose to attend Harper Junior College in Palatine, Illinois. After a year he moved on to the University of Southern California (USC) to play college baseball for the Trojans under coach Rod Dedeaux, and was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the first round of the 1968 draft. 

He began as a pitcher at USC before being converted to an outfielder.

In 1969, Kingman had a 11–4 win–loss record with a 1.38 earned run average (ERA) and batted .250 with four home runs and 16 runs batted in (RBIs) as a part-time hitter for USC. In the 1970 USC NCAA Championship Season, Kingman hit .355 with nine home runs and 25 RBIs, exclusively as a hitter, despite missing time mid-season due to injury.

In , Kingman was named an All-America and led the Trojans to the College World Series championship, along with teammates, pitchers Steve Busby, Jim Barr and Brent Strom. Kingman was then selected by the San Francisco Giants with the first pick of the secondary phase draft.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues (1970–1971) ===
After signing with the Giants, Kingman played for the Class AA Amarillo Giants in 1970 after the College 
World Series victory. He hit .295 with 15 home runs and 45 RBIs in 60 games. Moving to the Class AAA Phoenix Giants in 1971, he hit .278 with 26 home runs and 99 RBIs in 105 games before being called up by the San Francisco Giants.

===San Francisco Giants (1971–1974)===
Kingman came up as an outfielder and first baseman with the San Francisco Giants. He made his major league debut on July 30, , pinch running for Willie McCovey, and finishing the game at first base. He hit a home run in his next game, a grand slam, and hit two more a day later. He finished his rookie season with a .278 average with 6 home runs and 24 RBI in 41 games. Kingman appeared in the postseason when the Giants won the National League West and advanced to the National League Championship Series. Kingman went 1-for-10 with three strikeouts as the Giants lost in four games. It would be his only career postseason appearance.

On April 16, , the second day of the season, Kingman hit for the cycle in the Giants&#x27; 10–6 victory over the Houston Astros. A day earlier, he made his debut at third base, a position he would play off and on for the remainder of his Giants career. Kingman also made his major league debut on the mound with the Giants, pitching two innings of &quot;mop up duty&quot; in an 11–0 loss to the Cincinnati Reds on April 15, . He pitched again in the mop up role on May 13 in a 15–3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. In both games, he pitched the final two innings and gave up two earned runs.

In , he committed twelve errors in 59 chances at third, and lost his starting job to Steve Ontiveros. Following the season, the Giants sold their rights to him to the New York Mets.

In four seasons and 409 games with the Giants, Kingman hit .224 with 77 home runs and 217 RBI.

===New York Mets (1975–1977)===
Kingman&#x27;s contract was purchased by the New York Mets from the Giants for $150,000 on February 28, 1975.

Kingman played twelve games at third with the Mets; however, the Mets eventually abandoned the idea of Kingman as a third baseman and kept him primarily in the outfield. He emerged as a slugger upon his arrival in New York City, setting a club record with 36 home runs in . Kingman also scored 65 runs, the highest percentage of runs scored on homers for any player who hit more than 30 in a season. A year later, he broke his own record with 37 homers, and was elected to start in right field for the 1976 National League All-Star team. Kingman&#x27;s single season home run record for the Mets stood until 1987, when it was broken by Darryl Strawberry.

===San Diego Padres, California Angels and New York Yankees (1977)===
Kingman was batting .209 with nine home runs when he became one of the three players traded in the &quot;Midnight Massacre&quot; by the New York Mets. On June 15, , the Mets traded Kingman to the San Diego Padres for minor league pitcher Paul Siebert and Bobby Valentine; Tom Seaver was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn, Steve Henderson and Dan Norman; and Mike Phillips was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Joel Youngblood.

Kingman was waived by the Padres and claimed by the California Angels on September 6, 1977. On September 15, Kingman became one of only a handful of players to play for four major league teams in the same season (and the only one to play in each division in baseball in a single year since the establishment of divisional play in 1969) when he was traded by the Angels to the New York Yankees, for Randy Stein and cash. Although Kingman&#x27;s four home runs and seven RBI in eight games helped propel the Yankees into the post-season over the second place Boston Red Sox and Baltimore Orioles, he could not participate in the team&#x27;s push to a World Series crown as he was added to the roster after the August 31 cutoff date for postseason eligibility.

Overall, Kingman hit .221 with 26 home runs and 78 RBI in 132 games for the four teams in 1977.

===Chicago Cubs (1978–1980)===
Kingman signed as a free agent with the Chicago Cubs on November 30, 1977. He wanted to stay with the Yankees, who denied his request for a no-trade clause and offered him $1,250,000 with the expectation that no other team would pay him more money. Kingman&#x27;s five-year $1,375,000 contract included a $225,000 annual salary, a $250,000 bonus and an additional $50,000 in any year that the Cubs reached the 1.6 million mark in home attendance.
In 1978, Kingman hit .266 with 28 home runs and 78 RBI in 119 games with the Cubs.

Kingman had an excellent performance in Los Angeles on May 14, , when he hit three home runs against the Dodgers, including a three-run shot in the top of the 15th inning that gave the Cubs a 10–7 victory. Eight of the Cubs&#x27; ten runs were driven in by Kingman. Following the game, radio reporter Paul Olden asked Dodgers&#x27; manager Tommy Lasorda his opinion of Kingman&#x27;s performance that day, inspiring an oft-replayed (and censored) obscenity-laced tirade.

In , Kingman batted .288 with a National League-leading 48 homers, as well as 115 runs batted in (second to San Diego&#x27;s Dave Winfield&#x27;s 118) and 97 runs scored. He hit three home runs in a game twice that season, both coming in Cubs losses. The first was a slugging duel with Mike Schmidt on May 17 at Wrigley Field; Kingman hit three home runs and drove in six while Schmidt hit two in the game, with Schmidt delivering his second in the top of the tenth inning to give the Phillies a 23–22 victory. Kingman&#x27;s third home run during this game is likely the longest home run of his career, and believed to be the longest in the history of Wrigley Field. There is a street called Kenmore Avenue that T&#x27;s into Waveland Avenue behind left-center field. Kenmore is lined with houses, and the ball Kingman launched landed on the third porch roof on the east side of Kenmore, a shot estimated at 550 feet.

The second three-homer game for Kingman that year came against his former team on July 28 at Shea Stadium in a 6–4 loss to the Mets.

His .613 slugging percentage in 1979 was almost 50 points higher than that of his next closest National League competitor, Schmidt. Kingman finished eleventh in NL MVP balloting that year and led the league in strikeouts for the first time in his career (131).

In , Kingman (whose personality former Mets teammate John Stearns had once compared to a tree trunk) dumped a bucket of ice water on &quot;Daily Herald&quot; reporter Don Friske&#x27;s head late in spring training. Kingman regularly insisted he was misquoted, and he began appearing regularly in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, as the nominal author of a column ghostwritten by Chicago Park District employee Gerald Pfeiffer. Mike Royko, then writing for the rival &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, parodied Kingman&#x27;s column with a series using the byline &quot;Dave Dingdong.&quot;

The Cubs held a Dave Kingman T-shirt Day promotion in conjunction with its game with the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 7, but Kingman instead spent the afternoon at Navy Pier promoting Kawasaki Jet Skis at ChicagoFest.

Kingman was injured in 1980, playing in 81 games, hitting .278 with 18 home runs and 57 RBI.

Overall, in his three seasons with the Cubs, Kingman hit .278 with 94 home runs and 251 RBI and a .907 OPS in 345 games.

===Return to New York Mets (1981–1983)===
In January 1980, the Payson heirs sold the Mets franchise to the Doubleday publishing company for $21.1 million. Nelson Doubleday, Jr. was named chairman of the board while minority shareholder Fred Wilpon took the role of club president. Kingman was reacquired by the Mets from the Cubs for Steve Henderson and cash on February 28, . In separate deals, the new organization also reacquired Rusty Staub, and two seasons later, Tom Seaver.

Kingman primarily played first base upon his return to the Mets in 1981, and exclusively there in his second season back in New York. In , he tied his own Mets&#x27; single-season home run record while hitting .204, the lowest batting average for a first baseman with enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting title. It was also the first time where the Cy Young award winner (Steve Carlton) had a higher batting average than the home run champion. Leading the league in home runs that year, it is also the lowest batting average for any season&#x27;s home run leader. In spite of this, he still drove in 99 runs.

Kingman led the NL in strike outs both of the first two seasons of his return to the Mets (105 in an abbreviated 1981 &amp; 156 in 1982). On June 15, , the sixth anniversary of the Midnight Massacre, the Mets acquired first baseman Keith Hernandez from the St. Louis Cardinals for pitchers Neil Allen and Rick Ownbey. Kingman remained with the team for the remainder of the season in a limited role. He was released at the end of the season, and signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics.

In six total seasons with the Mets, Kingman hit .219 with 154 home runs and 389 RBI in 664 games.

===Oakland Athletics (1984–1986)===
On April 16, 1984, Kingman collected his fifth and final three-homer game, in a 9–6 win over the Seattle Mariners. He made just nine appearances at first base in , and was the A&#x27;s regular designated hitter the remainder of the time. For the 1984 season, he hit .268 with 35 home runs and 118 RBI. He was named the American League&#x27;s Comeback Player of the Year, and finished 13th in MVP balloting.

After hitting 30 home runs in 1985, Kingman&#x27;s 35 homers in 1986 were a record for a player in his final season, which held until surpassed by David Ortiz in 2016.

In three seasons as a DH in Oakland, he collected at least 30 home runs and 90 RBIs in each. He also had two at-bats which did not result in home runs, but nonetheless were noteworthy: in the Metrodome against the Minnesota Twins, on May 4, 1984, he hit a pop-up that flew into a hole in the roof and got stuck for a ground rule double. In a game in Seattle on April 11, , he hit a hard drive to left field which struck a speaker hanging from the roof of the Kingdome, bounced back and was caught for an out.

During his final year in Oakland in 1986, Kingman sent a live rat in a pink box to Sue Fornoff, a sportswriter for &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;. The rat had a tag attached to it that read, &quot;My name is Sue.&quot; Fornoff claimed that Kingman had told her that women do not belong in the clubhouse, and that he harassed her several times since she began covering the team the year before. Kingman himself said it was intended as a harmless practical joke. The A&#x27;s fined Kingman $3,500 and warned that he would be released if a similar incident occurred again.

When Kingman&#x27;s contract expired after the 1986 season, Oakland did not renew his contract and he became a free agent. Oakland signed former Athletic and future Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson for his final year as the team&#x27;s designated hitter for the 1987 season to play alongside the new blood in homerun hitting in Jose Canseco and rookie Mark McGwire.

In three seasons with Oakland, under managers Steve Boros, Jackie Moore, and Tony LaRussa, Kingman hit .230 with 100 home runs and 303 RBI.

Overall, in his career, Kingman hit .236 with 442 home runs and 1210 RBI. He had an .302 OB%, a 780 OPS with 608 walks and 1816 strikeouts in 1941 career games. Kingman averaged a home run every 15.11 at bats, tied with Juan González for 14th best all-time.

Kingman was awarded over $829,000 in damages for collusion by MLB owners against him (and other MLB players who were free agents).

==Retirement==
On July 11, 1987, Kingman signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants during the season. After twenty games at AAA Phoenix in which he batted .203 with two home runs and 11 RBI, he retired from baseball.

In 1989, Kingman played for the West Palm Beach Tropics of the Senior Professional Baseball Association, alongside other former major league players. He hit .271 with 8 HR and 40 RBI, as the Tropics had the best record in the Senior League. The league folded in 1990.

In , his first year of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame, he appeared on just three ballots, excluding him from future Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America voting. He was the first player to hit 400 or more home runs without being eventually inducted into the Hall of Fame.

== Personal life==
Kingman lives in the Lake Tahoe area. He has three children, Adam, Abby and Anna, and operates a local tennis club. His son Adam won season 3 of &quot;Making It&quot; and was crowned Master Maker.

<text>Art director is a title for a variety of similar job functions in theater, advertising, marketing, publishing, fashion, live-action and animated film and television, the Internet, and video games.

It is the charge of a sole art director to supervise and unify the vision of an artistic production. In particular, they are in charge of its overall visual appearance and how it communicates visually, stimulates moods, contrasts features, and psychologically appeals to a target audience. The art director makes decisions about visual elements, what artistic style(s) to use, and when to use motion. One of the biggest challenges art directors face is translating desired moods, messages, concepts, and underdeveloped ideas into imagery. In the brainstorming process, art directors, colleagues and clients explore ways the finished piece or scene could look. At times, the art director is responsible for solidifying the vision of the collective imagination while resolving conflicting agendas and inconsistencies between contributors&#x27; ideas.

In eastern animated works, such as Japanese anime and Chinese animation, the role of specifically refers to the artist in charge of supervising and directing the background art and the background art staff of a particular work rather than a role unifying a work&#x27;s overall artistic vision.

==In advertising==

Despite the title, an advertising art director is not necessarily the head of an art department. In modern advertising practice, an art director typically works with a copywriter as a creative team. In advertising, an art director makes sure the client&#x27;s message is conveyed to their desired audience. They are responsible for the advertising&#x27;s visual aspects, while working with other team members such as the graphic designer. They work together to devise an overall concept (also known as the &quot;creative&quot; or &quot;big idea&quot;) for the commercial, mailer, brochure, or other advertisements. The copywriter is responsible for the textual content, and the art director for the visual aspects. But the art director may come up with the headline or other copy, and the copywriter may suggest a visual or aesthetic approach. Each usually welcomes suggestions and constructive criticism from the other, as such collaboration often improves the work.

Although a good art director is expected to have good graphic design judgment and technical knowledge of production, it may &quot;not&quot; be necessary for an art director to hand-render comprehensive layouts, or even be able to draw, now that virtually all but the most preliminary work is done on computer.

Except in the smallest organizations, the art director/copywriter team is overseen by a creative director, senior media creative or chief creative director. In a large organization, an art director may oversee other art directors and a team of junior designers, image developers and/or production artists, and coordinate with a separate production department. In a smaller organization, the art director may fill all these roles, including overseeing printing and other production.

==In film==
An art director, in the hierarchical structure of a film art department, works directly below the production designer, in collaboration with the set decorator and the set designers. A large part of their duties include the administrative aspects of the art department. They are responsible for assigning tasks to personnel such as the art department coordinator and the construction coordinator, keeping track of the art department budget and scheduling, and overall quality control. They are often also a liaison to other departments, especially construction, special effects, property, transportation (graphics), and locations departments. The art director also attends all production meetings and tech scouts in order to provide information to the set designers in preparation for all departments to have a visual floor plan of each location visited.

The term &quot;art director&quot; was first used in 1914 by Wilfred Buckland when this title was used to denote the head of the art department (hence the Academy Award for Best Art Direction), which also included the set decorator. Now the award includes the production designer and set decorator. On the movie &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, David O. Selznick felt that William Cameron Menzies had such a significant role in the look of the film that the title art director was not sufficient, and so he gave Menzies the title of production designer. This title is now commonly used as the title for the head of the art department, although the title actually implies control over every visual aspect of a film, including costumes.

On films with smaller art departments, such as small independent films and short films, the terms &quot;production designer&quot; and &quot;art director&quot; are often synonymous, and the person taking on the role may be credited as either.

==In publishing==
Art directors in publishing typically work with the publication&#x27;s editors. Together, they work on a concept for sections and pages of a publication. Individually, the art director is mostly responsible for the visual look and feel of the publication, and the editor has ultimate responsibility for the publication&#x27;s verbal and textual contents.

<doc id="631164" wikidata="Q6546170" url="?curid=631164" title="Light entertainment">
<text>Light entertainment encompasses a broad range of television and radio programming that includes comedies, variety shows, game shows, quiz shows and the like.

==In the UK==
In the early days of the BBC, virtually all broadcast entertainment would be considered light by today&#x27;s standards, as great pains were taken not to offend audiences—which is not to say that they always succeeded in this.
Singers, magicians and comedians were drafted from the music hall circuit to fill the schedules. Stage acts were transferred directly to screen; in the case of productions such as &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;, the broadcasts actually came from large theatres. Many future household names, including The Beatles, were given their first public airings during these programmes, which attempted to cater for varying tastes through staging variety acts. Bruce Forsyth was one of several hosts for the show. He went on himself to present the studio-based &quot;Generation Game,&quot; which remains a landmark in the light entertainment genre. &quot;The Generation Game&quot; revolved around the now-common television standby of getting members of the public to provide the entertainment themselves by doing silly things for prizes. The show&#x27;s format was somewhere between the old variety programmes and the increasingly ubiquitous quiz shows and it and its descendants still appear in the television schedules.

=== 1970s ===
The 1970s continued the move away from the music hall format to studio-based shows. Staged concert acts lived on through television magicians such as Paul Daniels and Royal Variety Performances. &quot;The Comedians&quot; was another programme which looked back at the live entertainment of the music halls and was also a prototype of many later stand-up comedy series. It employed a number of comics from the working men&#x27;s club circuit to do their routines on camera.

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s the budgets available for light entertainment increased, and shows had dazzling sets and expensive prizes. With the simultaneous ascendancy of alternative comedy, however, the popularity of light entertainment shows started to decline among audiences. An example of this phenomenon is found in the name of a lesser-known panel show &quot;Bring Me the Head of Light Entertainment&quot; (which is also a pun on a broadcasting job description). Part of the complaint was that light entertainment sought to amuse, yet younger audiences found the attempts at humour weak and watery.

=== 1990s ===
Popular light entertainment in the 1990s included &quot;Barrymore&quot;, &quot;Des O&#x27;Connor Tonight&quot;, &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;, &quot;Stars in Their Eyes&quot; and &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot; as well as radio shows such as &quot;Wake Up to Wogan&quot;. Shows typically averaged over ten million viewers and over fifteen was not unusual.

=== 21st century ===
In spite of critical reaction, light entertainment continues to be popular, perhaps because it provokes no awkward questions when the viewing is shared by different generations of the same family. Current light entertainment stars include the Geordie double act Ant &amp; Dec. They have in the past included the late Bruce Forsyth and the late Cilla Black. &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; achieved a viewing figures ratings high of 8.5 million viewers in 2020.

==Canada==

During the 1970s, CBC Television introduced &quot;Sunday at Nine&quot;, a time slot where &#x27;&quot;dramas [such as &quot;Corwin&quot;] alternate with light entertainment [such as &quot;The Hart and Lorne Terrific Hour&quot;] and special documentaries.&quot;

<text>Psychroteuthis glacialis, the glacial squid, is the only known species in the monotypic genus Psychroteuthis, in the family Psychroteuthidae. While only one species has been confirmed, two undescribed species also probably exist. The species occurs in coastal waters near Antarctica and South America. It grows to a mantle length of .

==Ecology==
&quot;P. glacialis&quot; is known to feed on many crustaceans, fish, lanternfish, Antarctic krill, and Antarctic silverfish, and has been known to practice cannibalism. Animals known to routinely feed on glacial squid include the Antarctic petrel, light-mantled albatross, Ross seal, southern elephant seal, Weddell seal, Patagonian toothfish, wandering albatross, grey-headed albatross, the Adélie penguin, and the emperor penguin.

== Distribution ==
The squid inhabits the pelagic zone of the southern Ocean. It is found in depths of .

<doc id="631167" wikidata="Q3403317" url="?curid=631167" title="Prince Edward—Hastings (federal electoral district)">
<text>Prince Edward—Hastings was a federal electoral district in Ontario, Canada, that existed in the House of Commons of Canada from 1968 to 2015. Its population in 2006 was 113,227. It was redistributed between Bay of Quinte electoral district and Hastings—Lennox and Addington electoral district as a result of the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012.

==History==

The electoral district was created in 1966 from parts of Hastings South, Hastings—Frontenac, Northumberland, and Prince Edward—Lennox ridings.

It consisted of the County of Prince Edward, the Townships of Rawdon and Sidney (excluding the City of Belleville) in the County of Hastings, and the Townships of Brighton, Cramahe, Murray and Seymour in the County of Northumberland.

The electoral district was abolished in 1976 when it was redistributed between Northumberland and Prince Edward ridings, but Prince Edward riding was renamed &quot;Prince Edward—Hastings&quot; in 1978 before an election was held.

In 1976, Prince Edward riding was defined to consist of the County of Prince Edward, and, in the County of Hastings, the Townships of Hungerford, Huntingdon, Thurlow and Tyendinaga, the City of Belleville, and the Town of Deseronto, the Village of Frankford, and Tyendinaga Indian Reserve No. 38.

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the County of Prince Edward, and the part of the County of Hastings lying south of and including the townships of Hungerford, Huntingdon and Rawdon, south of but excluding the Village of Stirling, and excluding the City of Trenton.

In 2003, it was redefined to consist of the County of Prince Edward and the County of Hastings (except the City of Quinte West).

As part of the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012, the southern portion of district forms the bulk of the new Bay of Quinte district, while the northern portion becomes part of Hastings—Lennox and Addington.

==Members of Parliament==

This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:

<doc id="631172" wikidata="Q1757008" url="?curid=631172" title="Assistant director">
<text>The role of an assistant director (AD) on a film includes tracking daily progress against the filming production schedule, arranging logistics, preparing daily call sheets, checking cast and crew, and maintaining order on the set. They also have to take care of the health and safety of the crew. The role of an assistant to the film director is often confused with assistant director, but the responsibilities are entirely different. The assistant to the film director manages all of the directors in development, pre-production, while on set, through post-production, and is often involved in both personnel management as well as creative aspects of the production process.

Historically, assistant directing was a stepping stone to directing work: Alfred Hitchcock was an assistant, as well as Akira Kurosawa. This was when the role was more general and encompassed all aspects of filmmaking such as set design and script editing. This transition into film directing is no longer common in feature films, as the role has evolved into a more logistical and managerial position. It is more common now for an assistant director to transition to a theatre production management or producer role than to directing, with contemporary exceptions such as James McTeigue.

== Sub-roles ==
Often, the role of assistant director is broken down into the following sub-roles:
* The first assistant director (first or 1st AD) has overall AD responsibilities and supervises the second AD (2AD). The &quot;first&quot; is directly responsible to the director and &quot;runs&quot; the floor or set. The first AD and the unit production manager are two of the highest &quot;below the line&quot; technical roles in filmmaking (as opposed to creative or &quot;above the line&quot; roles) and so, in this strict sense, the role of first AD is non-creative. Their responsibility is to keep the production on schedule throughout the day, communicate to the entire crew, and to maintain the safety and security of the staff and shot itself. An assistant director must be very good at estimating how long a scene will take. (Sometimes a scene running a few pages long on the screenplay can be shot relatively quickly, while a half page emotional key moment may take all day). The first AD is paid very well to keep the production on track, and is usually the first person to be replaced (i.e., fired) if the production strays too far from its original schedule or budget.
* The second assistant director (second or 2nd AD) creates the daily call sheets from the production schedule, in cooperation with the production coordinator. The &quot;second&quot; also serves as the &quot;backstage manager&quot;, liaising with actors, putting cast through make-up and wardrobe, which relieves the &quot;first&quot; of these duties. Supervision of the second second assistant director, third assistant director, assistant director trainees, and the setting of background (extras) are parts of the &quot;second&#x27;s&quot; duties.
** The second second assistant director (second second or 2nd 2nd AD) deals with the increased workload of a large or complicated production. For example, a production with a large cast may require the division of the aspects of backstage manager and the call sheet production work to two separate people.
* The third assistant director (third or 3rd AD) works on set with the &quot;First&quot; and may liaise with the &quot;Second&quot; to move actors from base camp (the area containing the production, cast, and hair and makeup trailers), organize crowd scenes, and supervise one or more production assistants (PA). There is sometimes no clear distinction between a 2AD and a 3AD. Although some industry bodies, such as the Directors Guild of America, have defined the roles in an objective way, others believe it to be a subjective distinction. In general, the 3rd AD is a term used outside the United States and is sometimes synonymous with the role of a 2nd 2nd AD inside the US.
* The additional assistant director (AAD or Additional), or fourth assistant director (4AD or &quot;fourth&quot;), or &quot;key production assistant&quot; (key PA), may have a number of duties. Most commonly, the AAD has two broad job functions. One is the contraction of the duties of an AD where the AD acts as both second AD and third AD simultaneously. For example, a production with many cast may pass the 2AD call sheet production work to that of the AAD, especially when the 2AD is already performing the additional work of a third AD. The other main use of an AAD is as an adjunct to the 3AD and 1AD for logistically large scenes where more ADs are needed to control large numbers of extras. The &quot;Additional&quot; may also serve where the complexity of the scene or specialized elements within it (stunts, period work) require, or are best served by, a dedicated AD in most respects equal to a first AD - directing and controlling a number of other ADs to direct action to the satisfaction of the 1AD and the director.
* A production assistant is one of the lowest crew in a film&#x27;s hierarchy in terms of salary and authority. They perform various duties required of them by ADs.

The sub-roles of assistant directors differ among nations. For example, the distinction between second second AD and third AD is more common in North America. British and Australian productions, rather than having a second second AD, will hire a &quot;second&quot; 2AD experienced in the same duties, and trained to the same level, to allow a division of the duties. 3ADs in Britain and Australia have different duties from a second second AD, and the terms are not synonymous.

== Calling the roll ==
One of the first AD&#x27;s most important responsibilities is to &quot;call the roll&quot; — that is, call out a series of specific cues for each take to ensure that all cast and crew on set are aware of exactly what is going on so they can perform their particular role at the appropriate moment. Over the years, special procedures have been developed for this task to achieve maximum efficiency during shooting, which are usually some variant of the following:

# &quot;Waiting on...&quot; Though not technically part of calling the roll, first ADs may keep the set focused by frequently calling out which department is responsible for a delay in rolling a take. If the lights need to be adjusted, the first AD calls out, &quot;waiting on lighting&quot;. If the actors are still in their trailer, the first AD calls out &quot;Waiting on talent&quot;, etc. However, such calls can be regarded as applying excessive pressure to the department in question.
# &quot;Final checks, please&quot; (or &quot;last looks&quot;). Once everyone is in place, and rehearsals and blocking have finished, the first AD calls out, &quot;final checks&quot; or &quot;checks&quot;. This is the signal for any last minute adjustments, especially to hair, makeup, wardrobe, and props.
# Traditionally, the first AD calls &quot;quiet on the set&quot;. However, it is more common in current productions to hear first, &quot;Picture is up!&quot; (or, &quot;Rehearsal&#x27;s up&quot;, accordingly), followed by &quot;Quiet please!&quot; to alert everyone that the take is ready and imminent. &quot;Lock it down&quot;, or more commonly &quot;Lock it Up&quot;, is also a signal (particularly on location) to ensure nothing interrupts the take. This call is crucial for third assistant directors, as this is their primary responsibility during a take.
# &quot;Turnover&quot;. While most AD&#x27;s say both &quot;roll sound&quot; and &quot;roll camera&quot;, &quot;turnover&quot; signals both the camera and sound departments to start rolling. The sound department will roll first. After a second or two, the sound recordist will confirm that the recording equipment is running at the correct speed by calling &quot;Speed&quot; or &quot;Sound Speed&quot;. Hearing this, the clapper loader immediately calls out the &quot;Scene&quot; and &quot;Take&quot; numbers so that these details are on the recording. Simultaneously, (or within a very few seconds) the camera operator or focus puller will roll the camera, and as soon as the camera is confirmed as running at the correct speed, will call for the clapper-loader to &quot;mark it&quot; (or &quot;smack it&quot;, &quot;bang it&quot;, &quot;tag it&quot;, etc.). This is done by showing the slate (&quot;clapperboard&quot;) on camera, and bringing the clapper down to make a synchronisation point for audio (the sound of the clapper) and picture (the two parts of the clapper being seen to come together). With the slate quickly taken out of shot, and the camera refocused or repointed as necessary for the opening framing, the camera operator calls &quot;set&quot; or &quot;frame&quot; to indicate that all is ready to capture the action.
# The responsibility to call &quot;action&quot; is shared by either the first assistant director or the director, depending on the director&#x27;s preference. &quot;Action&quot; may be preceded by &quot;background action&quot; if extras must be in motion in the shot, which is called by one of the lower AD&#x27;s or sometimes the first.
# Usually the director says &quot;cut&quot;, but camera operators may also &quot;cut&quot; to save film if they know the take is unusable. The operator may also call &quot;cut&quot; if the camera has &quot;rolled out&quot;, i.e. run out of film. The operator will not cut if there are other cameras still rolling or an interruption would ruin the actor&#x27;s focus. 
# After the director has called &quot;cut&quot;, the first AD will check whether the director is happy with the take, and conclude the roll with a direction such as &quot;going again&quot; or &quot;that&#x27;s a take two&quot; if another take is required. If the director does not want another take, the AD will call &quot;check the gate&quot; (a signal for the focus puller or camera assistant to confirm that the camera has not malfunctioned during a take, and that there is no hair or fluff in the aperture (&quot;gate&quot;) where the film is exposed). When the camera has been checked, the call from the focus puller or camera assistant will be &quot;clear gate!&quot;. Then, if that set up is complete, the AD may call &quot;moving on&quot; or &quot;next set up&quot;. These announcements cue all departments and the ADs on set as to the next steps they must take. For example, &quot;reset&quot;, &quot;going again&quot; and/or &quot;back to one&quot; may require a reset of elements in the frame extras, cars - anything that moved back to where they started, which the third AD will oversee.

The above roll sequence can be varied by, for example, eliminating the sound calls and the clapping of the slate if the shot is mute or &quot;MOS&quot; (&quot;MOS&quot; is an abbreviation of unknown origin for shooting without sound). At other times, for expediency (e.g. if the shot begins with a closeup of a closed door which then opens), the slate may be shown at the end of the take rather than the beginning. In this case, once the sound is rolling, there is an audible announcement of &quot;End board&quot; (also &quot;end slate&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;, &quot;tail slate&quot;, or &quot;tail sticks&quot;) so that the editing department knows to look for the sync marks at the end of the action. At the conclusion of the action, the director will still call &quot;cut&quot;, but the first AD (and possibly others) will immediately call &quot;end board!&quot; or so that the camera and sound recorder are not turned off before the clapper is clapped. Also, as a visual cue to the editors, the clapper-board will be shown inverted on camera.

<text>A payday loan (also called a payday advance, salary loan, payroll loan, small dollar loan, short term, or cash advance loan) is a short-term unsecured loan, often characterized by high interest rates. These loans are typically designed to cover immediate financial needs and are intended to be repaid on the borrower&#x27;s next payday.

The term &quot;payday&quot; in payday loan refers to when a borrower writes a postdated check to the lender for the payday salary, but receives part of that payday sum in immediate cash from the lender. However, in common parlance, the concept also applies regardless of whether repayment of loans is linked to a borrower&#x27;s payday. The loans are also sometimes referred to as &quot;cash advances&quot;, though that term can also refer to cash provided against a prearranged line of credit such as a credit card. Legislation regarding payday loans varies widely between different countries, and in federal systems, between different states or provinces.

To prevent usury (unreasonable and excessive rates of interest), some jurisdictions limit the annual percentage rate (APR) that any lender, including payday lenders, can charge. Some jurisdictions outlaw payday lending entirely, while others have very few restrictions on payday lenders.

Payday loans have been linked to higher default rates.

==History ==
According to a 2007 study by economist Michael A. Stegman, payday loan firms were extremely rare prior to the 1990s, but have grown substantially since then.

===Impact===
A 2019 study found that payday loans in the United States &quot;increase personal bankruptcy rates by a factor of two ... by worsening the cash flow position of the household.&quot; A second 2019 study looking at the UK found that payday loans &quot;cause persistent increases in defaults and cause consumers to exceed their bank overdraft limits.&quot;

==The loan process==
The basic loan process involves a lender providing a short-term unsecured loan to be repaid at the borrower&#x27;s next payday. Typically, some verification of employment or income is involved (via pay stubs and bank statements), although according to one source, some payday lenders do not verify income or run credit checks. Individual companies and franchises have their own underwriting criteria.

In the traditional retail model, borrowers visit a payday lending store and secure a small cash loan, with payment due in full at the borrower&#x27;s next paycheck. The borrower writes a postdated check to the lender in the full amount of the loan plus fees. On the maturity date, the borrower is expected to return to the store to repay the loan in person. If the borrower does not repay the loan in person, the lender may redeem the check. If the account is short on funds to cover the check, the borrower may now face a bounced check fee from their bank in addition to the costs of the loan, and the loan may incur additional fees or an increased interest rate (or both) as a result of the failure to pay.

In the more recent innovation of online payday loans, consumers complete the loan application online (or in some instances via fax, especially where documentation is required). The funds are then transferred by to the borrower&#x27;s account, and the loan repayment and/or the finance charge is electronically withdrawn on the borrower&#x27;s next payday.

==User demographics and reasons for borrowing==
According to a 2012 study by The Pew Charitable Trusts, &quot;Most payday loan borrowers [in the United States] are white, female, and are 25 to 44 years old. However, after controlling for other factors, there are five groups that have higher odds of having used a payday loan: those without a four-year college degree; home renters; African Americans; those earning below $40,000 annually; and those who are separated or divorced.&quot; Most borrowers use payday loans to cover ordinary living expenses over the course of months, not unexpected emergencies over the course of weeks. The average borrower is indebted about five months of the year.

This reinforces the findings of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) study from 2011 which found black and Hispanic families, recent immigrants, and single parents were more likely to use payday loans. In addition, their reasons for using these products were not as suggested by the payday industry for one time expenses, but to meet normal recurring obligations.

Research for the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation found that a majority of Illinois payday loan borrowers earn $30,000 or less per year. Texas&#x27; Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner collected data on 2012 payday loan usage, and found that refinances accounted for $2.01 billion in loan volume, compared with $1.08 billion in initial loan volume. The report did not include information about annual indebtedness. A letter to the editor from an industry expert argued that other studies have found that consumers fare better when payday loans are available to them. Pew&#x27;s reports have focused on how payday lending can be improved, but have not assessed whether consumers fare better with or without access to high-interest loans. Pew&#x27;s demographic analysis was based on a random digit dialing survey of 33,576 people, including 1,855 payday loan borrowers.

In another study, by Gregory Elliehausen, Division of Research of the Federal Reserve System and Financial Services Research Program at the George Washington University School of Business, 41% earn between $25,000 and $50,000, and 39% report incomes of $40,000 or more. 18% have an income below $25,000.

==Criticism==
In the UK Sarah-Jayne Clifton of the Jubilee Debt Campaign said, &quot;austerity, low wages, and insecure work are driving people to take on high cost debt from rip-off lenders just to put food on the table. We need the government to take urgent action, not only to rein in rip-off lenders, but also to tackle the cost of living crisis and cuts to social protection that are driving people towards the loan sharks in the first place.&quot;

===Draining money from low-income communities===
The likelihood that a family will use a payday loan increases if they are unbanked or underbanked, or lack access to a traditional deposit bank account. In an American context the families who will use a payday loan are disproportionately either of black or Hispanic descent, recent immigrants, and/or undereducated. These individuals are least able to secure normal, lower interest rate forms of credit. Since payday lending operations charge higher interest rates than traditional banks (with notable exceptions, e.g., Barclays and Nationwide charge 35% and 39.99%, respectively), they have the effect of depleting the assets of low-income communities. The Insight Center, a consumer advocacy group, reported in 2013 that payday lending cost U.S communities $774 million a year.

A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded that, &quot;We ... test whether payday lending fits our definition of predatory. We find that in states with higher payday loan limits, less educated households and households with uncertain income are less likely to be denied credit, but are not more likely to miss a debt payment. Absent higher delinquency, the extra credit from payday lenders does not fit our definition of predatory.&quot; The caveat to this is that with a term of under 30 days there are no payments, and the lender is more than willing to roll the loan over at the end of the period upon payment of another fee. The report goes on to note that payday loans are extremely expensive, and borrowers who take a payday loan are at a disadvantage in comparison to the lender, a reversal of the normal consumer lending information asymmetry, where the lender must underwrite the loan to assess creditworthiness.

A 2012 law journal note summarized the justifications for regulating payday lending. The summary notes that while it is difficult to quantify the impact on specific consumers, there are external parties who are clearly affected by the decision of a borrower to get a payday loan. Most directly impacted are the holders of other low interest debt from the same borrower, which now is less likely to be paid off since the limited income is first used to pay the fee associated with the payday loan. The external costs of this product can be expanded to include the businesses that are not patronized by the cash-strapped payday customer to the children and family who are left with fewer resources than before the loan. The external costs alone, forced on people given no choice in the matter, may be enough justification for stronger regulation even assuming that the borrower him or herself understood the full implications of the decision to seek a payday loan.

Payday lenders have also been criticized for perpetuating a cycle of debt in their users as they leave people with less money overall. While most payday loans advertise themselves as &quot;the solution to life&#x27;s little surprises&quot;, this is rarely the case; 69% of payday loans are taken out to cover everyday recurring expenses such as electricity bills, gas, or groceries. This perpetuates the cycle of debt as payday lenders are more likely to resort to payday loans again once they are charged with the same recurring expense in the next few months.

===Advertising practices===
In May 2008, the debt charity Credit Action made a complaint to the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading (OFT) that payday lenders were placing advertising which violated advertising regulations on the social network website Facebook. The main complaint was that the APR was either not displayed at all or not displayed prominently enough, which is clearly required by UK advertising standards.

In 2016, Google announced that it would ban all ads for payday loans from its systems, defined as loans requiring repayment within 60 days or (in the US) having an APR of 36% or more.

===Unauthorized clone firms===
In August 2015, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) of the United Kingdom has announced that there has been an increase of unauthorized firms, also known as &#x27;clone firms&#x27;, using the name of other genuine companies to offer payday loan services. Therefore, acting as a clone of the original company, such as the case of Payday Loans Now. The FCA strongly advised to verify financial firms by using the Financial Services Register, prior to participating in any sort of monetary engagement.

===Aggressive collection practices===
In US law, a payday lender can use only the same industry standard collection practices used to collect other debts, specifically standards listed under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from using abusive, unfair, and deceptive practices to collect from debtors. Such practices include calling before 8 o&#x27;clock in the morning or after 9 o&#x27;clock at night, or calling debtors at work.

In many cases, borrowers write a post-dated check to the lender; if the borrowers do not have enough money in their account by the check&#x27;s date, their check will bounce. In Texas, payday lenders are prohibited from suing a borrower for theft if the check is post-dated. One payday lender named The Money Center in the state instead gets their customers to write checks dated for the day the loan is given. Customers borrow money because they do not have any, so the lender accepts the check knowing that it would bounce on the check&#x27;s date. If the borrower fails to pay on the due date, the lender sues the borrower for writing a hot check.

Payday lenders will attempt to collect on the consumer&#x27;s obligation first by simply requesting payment. If internal collection fails, some payday lenders may outsource the debt collection, or sell the debt to a third party.

A small percentage of payday lenders have, in the past, threatened delinquent borrowers with criminal prosecution for check fraud. This practice is illegal in many jurisdictions and has been denounced by the Community Financial Services Association of America, the industry&#x27;s trade association.

===Pricing structure of payday loans===
The payday lending industry argues that conventional interest rates for lower dollar amounts and shorter terms would not be profitable. For example, a $100 one-week loan, at a 20% APR (compounded weekly) would generate only 38 cents of interest, which would fail to match loan processing costs. Research shows that, on average, payday loan prices moved upward, and that such moves were &quot;consistent with implicit collusion facilitated by price focal points&quot;.

According to some consumer advocates and industry experts, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), and The Pew Charitable Trusts, payday loans are an example of a classic market failure. In a perfect market, sellers and buyers would compete rationally and prices would vary based on the market capacity. However, payday lenders have no incentive to lower their prices, since they cannot patent their loans. If one lender reduces its fees or interest rates to attract more customers, other lenders will quickly follow suit, canceling out any advantage. As a result, most payday lenders charge the maximum amount allowed by law, which can be as high as 400% annual percentage rate (APR).

==Proponents&#x27; stance and counterarguments==

===Industry profitability===
In a profitability analysis by &quot;Fordham Journal of Corporate &amp; Financial Law&quot;, it was determined that the average profit margin from seven publicly traded payday lending companies (including pawn shops) in the U.S. was 7.63%, and for pure payday lenders it was 3.57%. These averages are less than those of other traditional lending institutions such as credit unions and banks.

Comparatively the profit margin of Starbucks for the measured time period was just over 9%, and comparison lenders had an average profit margin of 13.04%. These comparison lenders were mainstream companies: Capital One, GE Capital, HSBC, Moneytree, and American Express Credit.

===Charges are in line with costs===
A study by the FDIC Center for Financial Research found that &quot;operating costs are not that out of line with the size of advance fees&quot; collected and that, after subtracting fixed operating costs and &quot;unusually high rate of default losses&quot;, payday loans &quot;may not necessarily yield extraordinary profits.&quot;

However, despite the tendency to characterize payday loan default rates as high, several researchers have noted that this is an artifact of the normal short term of the payday product, and that during the term of loans with longer periods there are frequently points where the borrower is in default and then becomes current again. Actual charge offs are no more frequent than with traditional forms of credit, as the majority of payday loans are rolled over into new loans repeatedly without any payment applied to the original principal.

The propensity for very low default rates seems to be an incentive for investors interested in payday lenders. In the Advance America 10-k SEC filing from December 2011 they note that their agreement with investors, &quot;limits the average of actual charge-offs incurred during each fiscal month to a maximum of 4.50% of the average amount of adjusted transaction receivables outstanding at the end of each fiscal month during the prior twelve consecutive months&quot;. They go on to note that for 2011 their average monthly receivables were $287.1 million and their average charge-off was $9.3 million, or 3.2%. In comparison with traditional lenders, payday firms also save on costs by not engaging in traditional forms of underwriting, relying on their easy rollover terms and the small size of each individual loan as method of diversification eliminating the need for verifying each borrower&#x27;s ability to repay. It is perhaps due to this that payday lenders rarely exhibit any real effort to verify that the borrower will be able to pay the principal on their payday in addition to their other debt obligations.

===Markets provide services otherwise unavailable===

Proponents of minimal regulations for payday loan businesses argue that some individuals that require the use of payday loans have already exhausted other alternatives. Such consumers could potentially be forced to illegal sources if not for payday loans. Tom Lehman, an advocate of payday lending, said:
:... payday lending services extend small amounts of uncollateralized credit to high-risk borrowers, and provide loans to poor households when other financial institutions will not. Throughout the past decade, this &quot;democratization of credit&quot; has made small loans available to mass sectors of the population, and particularly the poor, that would not have had access to credit of any kind in the past.

These arguments are countered in two ways. First, the history of borrowers turning to illegal or dangerous sources of credit seems to have little basis in fact according to Robert Mayer&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Loan Sharks, Interest-Rate Caps, and Deregulation&quot;. Outside of specific contexts, interest rates caps had the effect of allowing small loans in most areas without an increase of &quot;loan sharking&quot;. Next, since 80% of payday borrowers will roll their loan over at least one time because their income prevents them from paying the principal within the repayment period, they often report turning to friends or family members to help repay the loan according to a 2012 report from the Center for Financial Services Innovation. In addition, there appears to be no evidence of unmet demand for small dollar credit in states which prohibit or strictly limit payday lending.

A 2012 report produced by the American libertarian think tank Cato Institute found that the cost of the loans is overstated, and that payday lenders offer a product traditional lenders simply refuse to offer. However, the report is based on 40 survey responses collected at a payday storefront location. The report&#x27;s author, Victor Stango, was on the board of the Consumer Credit Research Foundation (CCRF), an organization funded by payday lenders, until 2015, and he received $18,000 in payments from CCRF in 2013.

===Household welfare increased===
A staff report released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York concluded that payday loans should not be categorized as &quot;predatory&quot; since they may improve household welfare. &quot;Defining and Detecting Predatory Lending&quot; reports &quot;if payday lenders raise household welfare by relaxing credit constraints, anti-predatory legislation may lower it.&quot; The author of the report, Donald P. Morgan, defined predatory lending as &quot;a welfare reducing provision of credit&quot;. However, he also noted that the loans are very expensive, and that they are likely to be made to under-educated households or households of uncertain income.

Brian Melzer of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University found that payday loan users did suffer a reduction in their household financial situation, as the high costs of repeated rollover loans impacted their ability to pay recurring bills such as utilities and rent. This assumes a payday user will rollover their loan rather than repay it, which has been shown both by the FDIC and the Consumer Finance Protection bureau in large sample studies of payday consumers.

Petru Stelian Stoianovici, a researcher from Charles River Associates, and Michael T. Maloney, an economics professor from Clemson University, found &quot;no empirical evidence that payday lending leads to more bankruptcy filings, which casts doubt on the debt trap argument against payday lending.&quot;

The report was reinforced by a Federal Reserve Board (FRB) 2014 study which found that while bankruptcies did double among users of payday loans, the increase was too small to be considered significant. The same FRB researchers found that payday usage had no positive or negative impact on household welfare as measured by credit score changes over time.

===Aid in disaster areas===
A 2011 study found that in natural disaster areas where payday loans were readily available consumers fared better than those in disaster zones where payday lending was not present. Not only were fewer foreclosures recorded, but such categories as birth rate were not affected adversely by comparison. Moreover, Morse&#x27;s study found that fewer people in areas served by payday lenders were treated for drug and alcohol addiction.

==Country specific==

===Australia===

Prior to 2009 regulation of consumer credit was primarily conducted by the states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the &quot;National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009&quot; (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the &quot;Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012&quot; (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within the definition of a small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory interest rate cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with Responsible lending obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.

===Canada===

Bill C28 supersedes the Criminal Code of Canada for the purpose of exempting Payday loan companies from the law, if the provinces passed legislation to govern payday loans. Payday loans in Canada are governed by the individual provinces. All provinces, except Newfoundland and Labrador, have passed legislation. For example, in Ontario loans have a maximum rate of 14.299% Effective Annual Rate (EAR) ($21 per $100, over two weeks). As of 2017, major payday lenders have reduced the rate to $18 per $100, over two weeks.

===United Kingdom===

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) estimates that there are more than 50,000 credit firms that come under its widened remit, of which 200 are payday lenders. Payday loans in the United Kingdom are a rapidly growing industry, with four times as many people using such loans in 2009 compared to 2006 – in 2009 1.2 million people took out 4.1 million loans, with total lending amounting to £1.2 billion. In 2012, it is estimated that the market was worth £2.2 billion and that the average loan size was around £270. Two-thirds of borrowers have annual incomes below £25,000. There are no restrictions on the interest rates payday loan companies can charge, although they are required by law to state the effective annual percentage rate (APR). In the early 2010s there was much criticism in Parliament of payday lenders.

In 2014 several firms were reprimanded and required to pay compensation for illegal practices; Wonga.com for using letters untruthfully purporting to be from solicitors to demand payment—a formal police investigation for fraud was being considered in 2014—and Cash Genie, owned by multinational EZCorp, for a string of problems with the way it had imposed charges and collected money from borrowers who were in arrears.

==== Changes in the UK law====
On 1 April 2014 there was a major overhaul in the way payday loans are issued and repaid.

First of all the FCA made sure all lenders can abide by two main goals:

* to ensure that firms only lend to borrowers who can afford it
* to increase borrowers&#x27; awareness of the cost and risk of borrowing unaffordably and ways to help if they have financial difficulties

On top of the main goals Martin Wheatley, the FCA&#x27;s chief executive officer, said:

:&quot;For the many people that struggle to repay their payday loans every year this is a giant leap forward. From January next year, if you borrow £100 for 30 days and pay back on time, you will not pay more than £24 in fees and charges and someone taking the same loan for fourteen days will pay no more than £11.20. That’s a significant saving.
:&quot;For those who struggle with their repayments, we are ensuring that someone borrowing £100 will never pay back more than £200 in any circumstance.
:&quot;There have been many strong and competing views to take into account, but I am confident we have found the right balance.
:&quot;Alongside our other new rules for payday firms – affordability tests and limits on rollovers and continuous payment authorities – the cap will help drive up standards in a sector that badly needs to improve how it treats its customers.&quot;

In order to achieve these goals the FCA has proposed the following:

* Initial cost cap of 0.8% per day
* Fixed default fees capped at £15
* Total cost cap of 100%

===United States===

In the United States, the rates of these loans used to be restricted in most states by the Uniform Small Loan Laws (USLL), with 36–40% APR generally the norm.

Payday loans are legal in 27 states, and 9 others allows some form of short term storefront lending with restrictions. The remaining 14 and the District of Columbia forbid the practice. The annual percentage rate (APR) is also limited in some jurisdictions to prevent usury. And in some states, there are laws limiting the number of loans a borrower can take at a single time.

As for federal regulation, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act gave the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) specific authority to regulate all payday lenders, regardless of size. Also, the Military Lending Act imposes a 36% rate cap on tax refund loans and certain payday and auto title loans made to active duty armed forces members and their covered dependents, and prohibits certain terms in such loans.

The CFPB has issued several enforcement actions against payday lenders for reasons such as violating the prohibition on lending to military members and aggressive collection tactics. The CFPB also operates a website to answer questions about payday lending. In addition, some states have aggressively pursued lenders they felt violate their state laws.

Payday lenders have made effective use of the sovereign status of Native American reservations, often forming partnerships with members of a tribe to offer loans over the Internet which evade state law. However, the Federal Trade Commission has begun to aggressively monitor these lenders as well. While some tribal lenders are operated by Native Americans, there is also evidence many are simply a creation of so-called &quot;rent-a-tribe&quot; schemes, where a non-Native company sets up operations on tribal land.

==Variations and alternatives==

===Alternatives to payday loans===
Other options are available to most payday loan customers. These include pawnbrokers, credit union loans with lower interest and more stringent terms which take longer to gain approval, employee access to earned but unpaid wages, credit payment plans, paycheck cash advances from employers (&quot;advance on salary&quot;), auto pawn loans, bank overdraft protection, cash advances from credit cards, emergency community assistance plans, small consumer loans, installment loans and direct loans from family or friends. The Pew Charitable Trusts found in 2013 their study on the ways in which users pay off payday loans that borrowers often took a payday loan to avoid one of these alternatives, only to turn to one of them to pay off the payday loan.

If the consumer owns their own vehicle, an auto title loan would be an alternative for a payday loan, as auto title loans use the equity of the vehicle as the credit instead of payment history and employment history.

Other alternatives include the Pentagon Federal Credit Union Foundation (PenFed Foundation) Asset Recovery Kit (ARK) program.

Basic banking services are also often provided through their postal systems.

=== Comparisons payday lenders make ===
Payday lenders do not compare their interest rates to those of mainstream lenders. Instead, they compare their fees to the overdraft, late payment, penalty fees and other fees that will be incurred if the customer is unable to secure any credit whatsoever.

The lenders may list a different set of alternatives (with costs expressed as APRs for two-week terms, even though these alternatives do not compound their interest or have longer terms):

* $100 payday advance with a $15 fee = 391% APR
* $100 bounced check with $54 NSF/merchant fees = 1,409% APR
* $100 credit card balance with a $37 late fee = 965% APR
* $100 utility bill with $46 late/reconnect fees = 1,203% APR

===Variations on payday lending===
A minority of mainstream banks and TxtLoan companies lending short-term credit over mobile phone text messaging offer virtual credit advances for customers whose paychecks or other funds are deposited electronically into their accounts. The terms are similar to those of a payday loan; a customer receives a predetermined cash credit available for immediate withdrawal. The amount is deducted, along with a fee, usually about 10 percent of the amount borrowed, when the next direct deposit is posted to the customer&#x27;s account. After the programs attracted regulatory attention, Wells Fargo called its fee &quot;voluntary&quot; and offered to waive it for any reason. It later scaled back the program in several states. Wells Fargo currently offers its version of a payday loan, called &quot;Direct Deposit Advance&quot;, which charges 120% APR. Similarly, the BBC reported in 2010 that controversial TxtLoan charges 10% for seven-days advance which is available for approved customers instantly over a text message.

Income tax refund anticipation loans are not technically payday loans (because they are repayable upon receipt of the borrower&#x27;s income tax refund, not at his next payday), but they have similar credit and cost characteristics. A car title loan is secured by the borrower&#x27;s car, but are available only to borrowers who hold clear title (i.e., no other loans) to a vehicle. The maximum amount of the loan is some fraction of the resale value of the car. A similar credit facility seen in the UK is a &quot;logbook loan&quot; secured against a car&#x27;s logbook, which the lender retains. These loans may be available on slightly better terms than an unsecured payday loan, since they are less risky to the lender. If the borrower defaults, then the lender can attempt to recover costs by repossessing and reselling the car.

===Postal banking===
Many countries offer basic banking services through their postal systems. The United States Post Office Department offered such a service, called the United States Postal Savings System, but it was discontinued in 1967. In January 2014 the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Postal Service issued a white paper suggesting that the USPS could offer banking services, to include small dollar loans for under 30% APR. Support and criticism quickly followed; opponents of postal banking argued that as payday lenders would be forced out of business due to competition.

<text>Pyroteuthidae (the fire squids) is a family of squids. The family comprises two genera. Species are diurnally mesopelagic, migrating into surface waters during the night. The family is characterised by the tentacles, which have a permanent constriction and bend near the base; and photophores occurring on the tentacles, eyeballs, and viscera. Members reach mantle lengths of 23–50 mm. Paralarvae of the family are common around the Hawaiian Islands, with up to 17% of collected specimens in the area belonging to Pyroteuthidae.

<doc id="631177" wikidata="Q11075207" url="?curid=631177" title="Cloverleaf interchange">
<text>A cloverleaf interchange is a two-level interchange in which all turns are handled by slip roads. To go left (in right-hand traffic; reverse directions in left-driving regions), vehicles first continue as one road passes over or under the other, then exit right onto a one-way three-fourths loop ramp (270°) and merge onto the intersecting road. The objective of a cloverleaf is to allow two highways to cross without the need for any traffic to be stopped by traffic lights. The limiting factor in the capacity of a cloverleaf interchange is traffic weaving.

== Overview ==

Cloverleaf interchanges, viewed from overhead or on maps, resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover or less often a 3-leaf clover.
In the United States, cloverleaf interchanges existed long before the Interstate system. They were originally created for busier interchanges that the original diamond interchange system could not handle. Their chief advantage was that they were free-flowing and did not require the use of such devices as traffic signals. This not only made them a viable option for interchanges between freeways (where such devices are typically not an option), but they could also be used for very busy arterials where signals could present congestion problems.

They are common in the United States and have been used for over 40 years as the Interstate Highway System expanded rapidly. One problem is that, frequently, large trucks exceeding the area speed limit roll over. Another problem is the merging of traffic (see below). For these reasons, cloverleaf interchanges have become a common point of traffic congestion at busy junctions.

At-grade cloverleaf configurations with full four leaves and full outside slip ramps are extremely rare, though one exists in Toms River, New Jersey. Any other intersection with merely one, two, or three leaf ramps with outer ramps would not be designated a &quot;cloverleaf&quot; and simply be referred to as a jughandle or parclo intersection.

== History ==
=== Background ===
The first cloverleaf interchange patented in the US was by Arthur Hale, a civil engineer in Maryland, on February 29, 1916.

A modified cloverleaf, with the adjacent ramps joined into a single two-way road, was planned in 1927 for the interchange between Lake Shore Drive (US 41) and Irving Park Road (ILL 19) in Chicago, Illinois, but a diamond interchange was built instead.

=== Beginning ===
The first cloverleaf interchange built in the United States was the Woodbridge Cloverleaf at intersection of the Lincoln Highway (Route 25) and Amboy—now St. Georges—Avenue (Route 4) (now U.S. 1/9 and Route 35) in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey. It opened in 1929, although it has since been replaced with a partial cloverleaf interchange. Before the cloverleaf was replaced in the late 2000s, it was judged eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Because of this, a commemorative film was made of the cloverleaf. The original cloverleaf interchange design was adapted by the Rudolph and Delano building firm from Philadelphia, from a photo Delano saw on a magazine cover about a highway in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The original inventor is unknown.

The first cloverleaf west of the Mississippi River opened on August 20, 1931, at Watson Road and Lindbergh Boulevard near St. Louis, Missouri, as part of an upgrade of U.S. 66.

The first cloverleaf interchange in Canada opened in 1937 at the junction of the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) and Provincial Highway 10 in Port Credit, Ontario (now a part of Mississauga, Ontario). As originally built, Highway 10 passed over the QEW. In 1962, the interchange was rebuilt with sub-collector roads along the QEW, and the orientation was also changed so that Highway 10 then passed under the QEW. The interchange was further modified between 2008 and 2010 by removing all but one loop ramp, creating a partial cloverleaf/diamond hybrid.

The cloverleaf was patented in Europe in Switzerland on October 15, 1928. The first cloverleaf in Europe opened in October 1935 at Slussen in central Stockholm, Sweden, followed in 1936 by Schkeuditzer Kreuz near Leipzig, Germany. This is now the interchange between the A 9 and A 14, and has a single flyover from the westbound A 14 to the southbound A 9. Kamener Kreuz was the first in continental Europe to open fully in 1937, at A 1 and A 2 near Dortmund, Germany.

== Problems ==
The primary drawback of the classic design of the cloverleaf is that vehicles merge onto the highway at the end of a loop immediately before other vehicles leave to go around another loop, creating conflict known as weaving. Weaving limits the number of lanes of turning traffic. Most road authorities have since been implementing new interchange designs with less-curved exit ramps that do not result in weaving. These interchanges include the diamond, parclo and single-point urban interchanges (SPUI) when connecting to an arterial road in non free-flowing traffic on the crossroad and the stack or clover and stack hybrids when connecting to another freeway or to a busy arterial in free-flowing traffic where signals are still not desired.

Not only are these ideas true for new interchanges, but they also hold when existing cloverleaf interchanges are upgraded. In Norfolk, Virginia, the interchange between US 13 and US 58 was originally a cloverleaf—it has since been converted to a SPUI. Also, many cloverleaf interchanges on California freeways, such as U.S. 101, are being converted to parclos. In Hampton, Virginia, a cloverleaf interchange between Interstate 64 and Mercury Boulevard has been partially unwound into a partial stack interchange. During 2008 and 2009, four cloverleaf interchanges along I-64/US 40 in St. Louis, Missouri, were replaced with SPUIs as part of a major highway-renovation project to upgrade the highway to Interstate standards. The original cloverleaf interchange in Delmont, Pennsylvania between Routes 22 and 66 was also converted to an SPUI.

A compromise is to add a collector/distributor road next to the freeway; this does not eliminate weaving but moves it off the main lanes of the freeway. An example of this is the State Highway 23/Interstate 43 interchange in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, where the exit/entrance roads on and off Highway 23 are two lanes next to the main I-43 freeway on the north and southbound sides of the road.

A few cloverleaf interchanges in California have been rebuilt to eliminate weaving on the freeway while keeping all four loop ramps, by adding bridges, similar to braided ramps.

Several cloverleaf interchanges have been eliminated by adding traffic lights on the non-freeway route. Sometimes, this is even done at the intersection of two freeways, particularly when one freeway terminates at an interchange with another. An example of this is in Lakewood, Washington, at the interchange between Interstate 5 and Washington State Route 512, where a visible ramp stub shows that one of the four leaves was removed, thus eliminating weave on I-5. In the future, the traffic signal will be replaced by a two-lane flyover, completing the freeway-to-freeway interchange once again. Cloverleaf interchanges also tend to occupy much more land than any other kind of interchange.

Numerous cloverleaf intersections in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, Canada, require the merging of traffic from the clover directly onto the collector/distributor lane. This requires the slowly moving driver coming around the loop ramp to merge with the quickly moving driver exiting on the collector/distributor lane with no opportunity to accelerate to match the flow of the oncoming driver. This speed differential in merging can be as great as 65 km/h (approx. 43 mph).

The cloverleaf interchange was not implemented in great numbers in the United Kingdom, because of these performance problems. There were originally three, one in Redditch and two in Livingston. One of the Livingston examples was remodeled in the mid-2000s as part of a public transport project. The Girton interchange near Cambridge was a &quot;half&quot;-cloverleaf interchange that regularly experienced peak-time congestion due to A14 westbound traffic weaving with M11 traffic. This interchange was redesigned in 2019 to remove one of the loops. In Ireland, partial cloverleaf set-ups exist at the interchanges of the main roads out of Dublin and the M50, allowing free-flow movements in all directions. The Red Cow Interchange is an example.

Most cloverleaf interchanges have been phased out in Ontario, but some close variants do remain with similar traffic flows. The main difference however is that adjacent on and off ramps are shared together by single bidirectional carriageways. Examples include the Highway 62 and Highway 401 interchange in Belleville, Ontario, the Highway 4 and Highway 401 in London, Ontario, as well as the Lawrence Avenue and Don Valley Parkway interchange in Toronto. The Don Mills Road and Don Valley Parkway and the Highway 27 and Dixon Road are also other examples; however, one quadrant of each has a loop missing.

<doc id="631179" wikidata="Q18197265" url="?curid=631179" title="Criminal Investigation Department">
<text>The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is the branch of a police force to which most plainclothes detectives belong in the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth nations. A force&#x27;s CID is distinct from its Special Branch (though officers of both are entitled to the rank prefix &quot;Detective&quot;). The name derives from the CID of the Metropolitan Police, formed on 8 April 1878 by C. E. Howard Vincent as a re-formation of its Detective Branch. British colonial police forces all over the world adopted the terminology developed in the UK in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and later the police forces of those countries often retained it after independence. English-language media often use &quot;CID&quot; as a translation to refer to comparable organisations in other countries.

==By country==

===Afghanistan===
The &quot;Criminal Investigation Department&quot; is under the Afghan National Police.

===Bangladesh===
===France===
The Direction Centrale de la Police Judiciaire (DCPJ) is the national authority of the criminal division of the French National Police. Its function is to lead and co-ordinate the action of the law enforcement forces against crime.

===Germany, Austria and Switzerland===

&quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; is the standard term for the criminal investigation agency within the police forces of Germany, Austria, and the German-speaking cantons of Switzerland.

===Hong Kong===
The Hong Kong Police Force&#x27;s CID is a sub-branch unit within the Criminal Intelligence Bureau under the crime wing of the &quot;B&quot; department (crime and security).

===India===
Many state police forces in India possess a CID (sometimes known as the &quot;investigation branch&quot;) as a specialised wing. Personnel attached to this wing work in plain clothes, or &quot;mufti&quot;. A CID may contain sub-branches, for instance the CID in Uttar Pradesh includes the state crime investigation bureau, finger print bureau and scientific section.

Like their counterparts in the law and order police (&quot;local police&quot;), the crime branch has its own ranks up to the level of additional director general of police or special commissioner of police. The crime branch has senior officers like superintendents, inspectors and sub-inspectors. Officers and men attached to this wing generally add the prefix &quot;detective&quot; before their regular police rank.

While the name &quot;CID&quot; is used in several states, some states use different names for their CID units. In Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Gujarat, the CID is known as the Crime Investigation Department. In Assam, Bihar, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajastan, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Jammu and Kashmir, it is known as the Criminal Investigation Department. In Delhi and Kerala, the CID is referred to as the Crime Branch, and in Tamil Nadu, it is known as the Crime Branch - Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID).

The crime branch&#x27;s tasks are to investigate criminal cases, which span across multiple districts or states. The CID may also take up complicated cases like communal riot cases, circulation of counterfeit currency or very complicated murder cases. A crime branch investigation is ordered either by a judicial court, by the director-general of police, or the government.

Crime branch officers can be transferred to the law and order police, and vice versa. The crime branch is different from the crime detachment or crime squad. Crime Detachment and Crime Squads are a group of regular law and order policemen (who generally wear the uniform specifically detailed by the police inspector to work in plain clothes to keep a tab on local criminal elements, prostitutes, petty thieves, and other habitual offenders.

===Indonesia===
The criminal investigation units within the Indonesian National Police are called &quot;sat-reskrim&quot; (&quot;satuan reserse kriminal&quot;) meaning &quot;criminal investigation unit&quot;, it is under the &quot;bareskrim&quot; (&quot;badan reserse kriminal&quot;) &quot;criminal investigation agency&quot; which is under the command of the national police headquarters. Every regional police force in Indonesia has this unit; they are concerned with conducting criminal investigations and identification activities.

===Ireland===
The Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) maintained a CID along British lines before the independence of most of Ireland in December 1922. After the Partition of Ireland and the establishment of the Irish Free State in the early 1920s, the Government of the Irish Free State set up a CID for the purposes of counter-insurgency during the 1922-1923 Irish Civil War. It was separate from the unarmed Civic Guard, which later became the Garda Síochána. The Garda today operates local detective squads and several specialised, national detective units, including the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation.

In Northern Ireland, a region that came into existence in 1921 and which has remained within the United Kingdom, a new police force was formed in June 1922 called the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). This force had its own CID from the start. In November 2001, the RUC was replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

===Japan===

Criminal investigation departments or bureaus are set up within each Prefectural police headquarters. They maintain two (third or even fourth divisions are established in some urban prefecture), a (reinforced as an independent department or headquarters in the TMPD and some prefecture), a mobile investigation unit, and a . The are first responders for initial criminal investigations, distributed among the region with unmarked cars. The are specialised detective units of the first investigation divisions, well acquainted with new technologies and special tactics including SWAT capabilities.

===Kenya===
===Malaysia===

The CID of the Royal Malaysian Police is involved with the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of crimes that affect people (e.g. murder, robbery with firearms, rape and injury) and property crime (e.g. theft and house-breaking). Modeled on the British police, this department enforces laws regarding gambling, &quot;sin&quot; and the Triad in Malaysia.

===Pakistan===

The CID in Pakistan is a special unit of the provincial and metropolitan police departments, responsible for carrying out investigations into crimes, including terrorism, murders, organised crime and sectarianism.
The special branch of the CID in the Asia Division (CIDA) was a division of this department but is currently not operational. It had only 12 members, the names of which are not available because of security issues.

===Singapore===

The Singapore Police Force&#x27;s CID is the agency for premier investigation and staff authority for criminal investigation matters within the Singapore Police Force.

===Sri Lanka===

The CID of the Sri Lanka Police Service is responsible for carrying out investigations into crimes including murder and organised crime. It was established in 1870.

===United Kingdom===
Detectives are usually either assigned to a CID unit within a local policing command, or to a central specialised unit dealing with a specific type of crime, such as fraud or sexual offences. Most local police stations have more uniformed officers than CID officers; a smaller station might have five DCs with a Detective Sergeant (DS) in command, while a larger station would have more CID officers under a detective of higher rank. A particular case would be assigned to a Senior Investigating Officer (SIO) whose rank would depend on the seriousness of the crime and their force&#x27;s policy.

Detectives in the United Kingdom do not have a separate rank system and are not senior to uniformed officers who hold the same rank, however, a senior detective does outrank a uniformed officer of a lower rank. for example a Detective Inspector outranks a uniformed Sergeant. Before 1999, female detectives&#x27; ranks were prefixed with &quot;Woman&quot;, as in other branches of the police. The head of the CID in most police forces is a Detective Chief Superintendent. Ranks are abbreviated as follows:

*Detective Constable (DC or Det Con)
*Detective Sergeant (DS or Det Sgt)
*Detective Inspector (DI or Det Insp)
*Detective Chief Inspector (DCI or Det Ch Insp)
*Detective Superintendent (DSU or Det Supt)
*Detective Chief Superintendent (DCS or Det Ch Supt)

To join a CID in the United Kingdom, a police officer usually must have served in uniform for at least two years. From 2017 direct entry to the detective branch became possible. While training as a detective they are referred to as a &quot;Trainee Detective Constable&quot; (TDC) and after completing the national Initial Crime Investigators&#x27; Development Programme, typically taking around two years, they become full Detective Constables (DCs).

There is generally no pay increment on obtaining detective status in most forces. Previously paid allowances such as the detective duty allowance (a small payment intended to allow officers to purchase refreshments and other similar petty cash purposes) and the plainclothes allowance (an allowance used to purchase suitable clothing) have all been withdrawn over the past few years.

====Military investigations====
The Royal Military Police (RMP), Royal Navy Police (RNP), and RAF Police all maintained a Special Investigation Branch (SIB), fulfilling much the same role as a civilian CID. These Units have all been merged into a tri-service unit called the Defence Serious Crime Unit (DSCU). The Ministry of Defence Police is a civilian force that provides policing services on military bases, and as such has a CID much like a territorial police force. The RMP SIB has regular sections and one Army Reserve section. To join the reserve section, a reservist must either have a regular army SIB or civilian CID background.

<text>The 2004 Australian Grand Prix (officially the 2004 Foster&#x27;s Australian Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 March 2004 at the Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit. It was Race 1 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship. Michael Schumacher won the race for Ferrari from pole position in dominant fashion, with his teammate Rubens Barrichello finishing behind him in second. This 1–2 finish gave Ferrari a strong 9-point lead in the constructors&#x27; standings after just one race. Williams and Renault each had both cars finish in the points while McLaren, a team that had enjoyed success in years preceding this, only managed one point, with David Coulthard finishing a lapped 8th. The 1-2 finish for Schumacher and Barrichello was the first one-two finish for their Ferrari team since the 2002 Japanese Grand Prix.

This race marked the first time since the 2001 San Marino Grand Prix that cars competed without using fully-automatic gearboxes and launch control, which were both banned by the FIA after the season. The use of traction control was still permitted by the FIA, and would continue to be used over the next three seasons, until being banned for the season.

This race also marked the 150th Grand Prix race for the McLaren and Mercedes engine partnership since 1995.

==Report==
===Friday drivers===
The bottom six teams in the 2003 Constructors&#x27; Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.

Leinders was entered as Third Driver but was refused a superlicence until he completed the required mileage in an F1 car. He satisfied this requirement before the next race.

===Qualifying===
Qualifying resulted in a Ferrari one-two, with Juan Pablo Montoya third on the grid for Williams. Gianmaria Bruni, Christian Klien and Olivier Panis all failed to set a qualifying time.

===Race===
At the start, Alonso was up and away and ahead of Button and looking for a way to deal with Montoya while Jarno Trulli went from ninth on the grid to be fifth out of the first corner. He was aided in his task by Montoya, who went howling down to Turn 1, braked just a hint too late and Montoya was jumped by the Renault of Fernando Alonso as he tried to stay ahead of the surging Alonso. He went off and Alonso had to put some wheels on the grass to avoid a disaster. Montoya went back to seventh. That condemned the Colombian to an afternoon stuck in traffic and put paid to any challenge there might have been for Alonso. Behind all this there were a few wheels off the grass as others sorted themselves out (notably both Saubers) while Takuma Sato bumped the rear end of Trulli&#x27;s Renault, slightly (but significantly) damaging both cars.

The Ferraris were gone already and as the afternoon developed all that Fernando Alonso could do was to watch the rears of the two red cars as they disappeared from his view. It did not take long. By the fourth lap they were two seconds ahead. By the eighth lap they were five seconds clear and after that Alonso had nothing to do. No one else could keep up with him. Sauber&#x27;s Giancarlo Fisichella had a long battle for position in the midfield with Jordan&#x27;s Nick Heidfeld. Fisichella passed Heidfeld, who later dropped out of the race with a transmission failure. Heidfeld was involved in an incident in the pit lane where the mechanic Matt Deane and refueller Mick Gomme were hit by the car and suffered some bruising. Montoya attempted to regain the place by going around the outside of the Spaniard into the first turn, but outbraked himself and ran wide. This dropped him behind his teammate Ralf Schumacher, who&#x27;d qualified 8th. Despite repassing Ralf Schumacher on-track, the Colombian ended up behind him again by the race&#x27;s end in fifth place. The race proved that Ferrari once again had a dominant car, with Michael Schumacher winning from teammate Rubens Barrichello in Ferrari&#x27;s first one-two since Japan 2002, while the rest of the field was over 20 seconds behind. Schumacher led every one of the 58 race laps. At the start, Montoya was jumped by the Renault of Fernando Alonso.

Fernando Alonso gave Renault a podium with third place, while Jenson Button got BAR off the mark with sixth. Jarno Trulli finished 7th in the Renault and was the first lapped runner. McLaren seemed to be less competitive than in recent years, with Kimi Räikkönen becoming the first retirement of the year, dropping out with an engine problem, and with David Coulthard picking up just 1 point in eighth place.

<text>In statistics, Halton sequences are sequences used to generate points in space for numerical methods such as Monte Carlo simulations. Although these sequences are deterministic, they are of low discrepancy, that is, appear to be random for many purposes. They were first introduced in 1960 and are an example of a quasi-random number sequence. They generalize the one-dimensional van der Corput sequences.

== Example of Halton sequence used to generate points in (0, 1) × (0, 1) in R2 ==

The Halton sequence is constructed according to a deterministic method that uses coprime numbers as its bases. As a simple example, let&#x27;s take one dimension of the two-dimensional Halton sequence to be based on 2 and the other dimension on 3. To generate the sequence for 2, we start by dividing the interval (0,1) in half, then in fourths, eighths, etc., which generates
: , , 
: , ...

Equivalently, the nth number of this sequence is the number n written in binary representation, inverted, and written after the decimal point. This is true for any base. As an example, to find the sixth element of the above sequence, we&#x27;d write 6 = 1*2 + 1*2 + 0*2 = 110, which can be inverted and placed after the decimal point to give 0.011 = 0*2 + 1*2 + 1*2 = . So the sequence above is the same as

: 0.1, 0.01, 0.11, 0.001, 0.101, 0.011, 0.111, 0.0001, 0.1001...

To generate the sequence for 3 for the other dimension, we divide the interval (0,1) in thirds, then ninths, twenty-sevenths, etc., which generates
When we pair them up, we get a sequence of points in a unit square:

Even though standard Halton sequences perform very well in low dimensions, correlation problems have been noted between sequences generated from higher primes. For example, if we started with the primes 17 and 19, the first 16 pairs of points: (, ), (, ), (, ) ... (, ) would have perfect linear correlation. To avoid this, it is common to drop the first 20 entries, or some other predetermined quantity depending on the primes chosen. Several other methods have also been proposed. One of the most prominent solutions is the scrambled Halton sequence, which uses permutations of the coefficients used in the construction of the standard sequence. Another solution is the &quot;leaped Halton&quot;, which skips points in the standard sequence. Using, e.g., only each 409th point (also other prime numbers not used in the Halton core sequence are possible), can achieve significant improvements.

== Implementation ==
In pseudocode:
 algorithm Halton-Sequence is
 inputs: index formula_1
 base formula_2
 output: result formula_3
 formula_4
 formula_5
 while formula_6 do
 formula_7
 formula_8
 formula_9
 return formula_3

An alternative implementation that produces subsequent numbers of a Halton sequence for base &quot;b&quot; is given in the following generator function (in Python). This algorithm uses only integer numbers internally, which makes it robust against round-off errors.

def halton_sequence(b):
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Generator function for Halton sequence.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 n, d = 0, 1
 while True:
 x = d - n
 if x == 1:
 n = 1
 d *= b
 else:
 y = d // b
 while x &lt;= y:
 y //= b
 n = (b + 1) * y - x
 yield n / d

<doc id="631190" wikidata="Q816502" url="?curid=631190" title="Ben Gibbard">
<text>Benjamin Gibbard (born August 11, 1976) is an American singer, songwriter and guitarist. He is best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie, with whom he has recorded ten studio albums, and as a member of the supergroup The Postal Service. Gibbard released his debut solo album, &quot;Former Lives&quot;, in 2012, and a collaborative studio album, &quot;One Fast Move or I&#x27;m Gone&quot; (2009) with Jay Farrar.

==Early life==
Gibbard was born to Allen and Margaret (née Flach) Gibbard in Bremerton, Washington. His father was in the Navy and his family moved around the country, including spending time in Northern Virginia before returning to Washington. Gibbard spent his early life there during the grunge music explosion of the early 1990s. He graduated from Olympic High School in Bremerton in 1994, and studied environmental chemistry at Western Washington University. He was raised Catholic.

== Career ==

In 1996, while playing guitar in the band Pinwheel, Gibbard recorded a demo cassette under the moniker Death Cab for Cutie, titled &quot;You Can Play These Songs with Chords&quot; (1997). After receiving a positive response to the material, Gibbard expanded the project into a full band, with the addition of guitarist Chris Walla, bassist Nick Harmer and drummer Nathan Good. The following year, the band released its debut album, &quot;Something About Airplanes&quot; (1998), on Barsuk Records, and released its follow-up, &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;, in 2000.

Gibbard had a minor role in the John Krasinski film &quot;Brief Interviews with Hideous Men&quot; based on the David Foster Wallace short story collection of the same title. He completed a solo tour through the US in the spring of 2007 that featured David Bazan of Pedro the Lion and singer-songwriter Johnathan Rice.

In November 2014, Gibbard appeared as a guest on Foo Fighters&#x27; eighth studio album &quot;Sonic Highways&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Gibbard became engaged to actress and musician Zooey Deschanel in 2008 and married in September 2009 near Seattle. They announced their separation on November 1, 2011, with Deschanel filing for divorce on December 27, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on December 12, 2012. Gibbard later married photographer and tour manager Rachel Demy on October 21, 2016 in Seattle.

In a 2003 interview, Gibbard stated that while he had previously been a vegan, he recently became a pescetarian. He reportedly gave up alcohol in 2008 and began running marathons. He ran his first trail ultramarathon in 2013 and has since completed several each year.

Gibbard is a lapsed Catholic who now identifies as agnostic: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to falsely believe in something solely so I can jump to the front of the line for whatever this awesome place is we go after we die. [...] The vastness of that idea is so beyond my comprehension that I feel like if there was a God, then that God would accept me saying I&#x27;m not able to believe because it&#x27;s so outside of my ability to understand it. I understand that&#x27;s where faith comes into play.&quot;

Gibbard has been a fan of the MLB&#x27;s Seattle Mariners since the age of five and has thrown the first pitch at two Mariners games. When the Mariners traded Ichiro Suzuki to the New York Yankees in 2012, Gibbard honored him by writing and releasing the song &quot;Ichiro&#x27;s Theme&quot;. Gibbard&#x27;s handwritten lyrics for the song are currently in the archive of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. In 2024, Gibbard performed the national anthem at the Mariners&#x27; Opening Day game at T-Mobile Park.

== Politics ==

Gibbard is an activist for gay rights and wrote an article in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; explaining why the issue is important to him. He stated that when his lesbian sister got married, it was &quot;the most beautiful thing&quot; he ever saw. In the article, he voiced his support for Washington Referendum 74 and discussed raising money for the issue. He stated, &quot;I would just feel so much pride for my state if we could pass it by a popular vote and show the rest of the country that this is the direction we are going in.&quot;

Gibbard has been open about his political views, expressing his support of the Democratic Party. On October 10, 2016, Death Cab for Cutie released &quot;Million Dollar Loan&quot;, the first song in the Dave Eggers project, 30 Days, 50 Songs. The song targets Donald Trump as it satirizes the fact he asked his father for a million dollar loan. Gibbard said of the song: &quot;Lyrically, &#x27;Million Dollar Loan&#x27; deals with a particularly tone deaf moment in Donald Trump&#x27;s ascent to the Republican nomination. While campaigning in New Hampshire last year, he attempted to cast himself as a self-made man by claiming he built his fortune with just a &#x27;small loan of a million dollars&#x27; from his father. Not only has this statement been proven to be wildly untrue, he was so flippant about it. It truly disgusted me.&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gibbard live streamed daily concerts from his home after canceling shows due to the pandemic. Gibbard played songs by his bands Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service and other artists such as the Decemberists, Radiohead, New Order, Depeche Mode and the Beatles while promoting local Washington non-profit organizations.

== Musical equipment ==
As of May 2015, Gibbard tours with four modified 1970s Fender Mustang guitars. Additionally, he uses two custom-built Acme Silvertone amplifier heads. For use on acoustic songs, he relies on two 2008 Gibson J-45 Acoustic Guitars with B-Band pickup systems. As of 2016, Gibbard has since began using Supro amplifiers. In the past, Gibbard played 1980s Japanese-built Squier Bullets through a Sears Silvertone amp, which he immortalized in the lyrics to the song No Joy In Mudville. He also used Fender Telecasters and G&amp;L ASAT guitars.

In January 2021, Fender announced the Ben Gibbard Mustang as part of their Artist Signature series, designed to Ben&#x27;s specifications and inspired by the 1970s Mustangs he uses on tour. The guitar features several unique features including a chambered ash body, custom &quot;Ben Gibbard&quot; pickups, and simplified electronics.

==In popular culture==
Gibbard is the subject of the song &quot;Ben&#x27;s My Friend&quot; by indie folk act Sun Kil Moon. The track appears on the project&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Benji&quot; (2014). On Sun Kil Moon&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Universal Themes&quot; (2015), primary recording artist Mark Kozelek again refers to his friendship with Gibbard on its closing track, &quot;This Is My First Day and I&#x27;m Indian and I Work at a Gas Station&quot;. Gibbard previously made a guest appearance on the band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;April&quot; (2008).

Gibbard is also referenced in &quot;The Cones of Dunshire&quot;, an episode from the sixth season of &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. In the episode, April (Aubrey Plaza) attempts to promote a forest cabin to hipsters by claiming that &quot;Ben Gibbard and Neko Case made out here once.&quot;

<doc id="631191" wikidata="Q663753" url="?curid=631191" title="Kame">
<text>A kame, or &quot;knob&quot;, is a glacial landform, an irregularly shaped hill or mound composed of sand, gravel and till that accumulates in a depression on a retreating glacier, and is then deposited on the land surface with further melting of the glacier. Kames are often associated with kettles, and this is referred to as &quot;kame and kettle&quot; or &quot;knob and kettle&quot; topography. The word &quot;kame&quot; is a variant of &quot;comb&quot; (, or is the Old Scottish word meaning &#x27;comb&#x27;), which has the meaning &quot;crest&quot; among others. The geological term was introduced by Thomas Jamieson in 1874.

According to White, &quot;kames were formed by meltwater which deposited more or less washed material at irregular places in and along melting ice. At places the material is very well washed and stratified; at others it is more poorly washed, with inclusions of till masses that fell from ice but were covered before they were completely washed. Kame gravels thus tend to be variable and range from fine to coarse grained and even to cobbly and boulder.&quot;

With the melting of the glacier, streams carry sediment to glacial lakes, building kame deltas on top of the ice. However, with the continuous melting of the glacier, the kame delta eventually collapses onto the land surface, furthering the &quot;kame and kettle&quot; topography.

Kame terraces are frequently found along the side of a glacial valley and are stratified deposits of meltwater streams flowing between the ice and the adjacent valley side. These kame terraces tend to look like long, flat benches, with many pits on the surface made by kettles. They tend to slope downvalley with gradients similar to the glacier surface along which they formed, and can sometimes be found paired on opposite sides of a valley.

Kames are sometimes compared to drumlins, but their formation is distinctively different. A drumlin is not originally shaped by meltwater, but by the ice itself and has a quite regular shape. It occurs in fine-grained material, such as clay or shale, not in sands and gravels. And drumlins usually have concentric layers of material, as the ice successively plasters new layers in its movement.

==Examples==
Kames are not normally located in proximity to one another, however in Edmonton, Alberta, numerous kames are found nearby, forming the Prosser Archaeological Site. The Fonthill Kame in southern Ontario is in a densely populated area. Examples can also be found in Wisconsin and at the Sims Corner Eskers and Kames National Natural Landscape in Washington. They are also located in Mendon Ponds Park, southeast of Rochester, New York. This park is on the National Registry of Natural Landmarks due to geological history and presence of significant kames, eskers and kettles.

In Ontario, there are two provincial parks, both designated as IUCN nature reserves, which were created to protect important and undisturbed kame features. They are Minnitaki Kames Provincial Park and Bonheur River Kame Provincial Park.

<doc id="631196" wikidata="Q2196894" url="?curid=631196" title="Golgi's method">
<text>Golgi&#x27;s method is a silver staining technique that is used to visualize nervous tissue under light microscopy. The method was discovered by Camillo Golgi, an Italian physician and scientist, who published the first picture made with the technique in 1873. It was initially named the black reaction (&quot;la reazione nera&quot;) by Golgi, but it became better known as the Golgi stain or later, Golgi method.

Golgi staining was used by Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934) to discover a number of novel facts about the organization of the nervous system, inspiring the birth of the neuron doctrine. Ultimately, Ramón y Cajal improved the technique by using a method he termed &quot;double impregnation&quot;. Ramón y Cajal&#x27;s staining technique, still in use, is called Cajal&#x27;s stain.

==Mechanism==

The cells in nervous tissue are densely packed, and little information on their structures and interconnections can be obtained if all the cells are stained. Furthermore, the thin filamentary extensions of neural cells, including the axon and the dendrites of neurons, are too slender and transparent to be seen with normal staining techniques. Golgi&#x27;s method stains a limited number of cells at random in their entirety. The mechanism by which this happens is still largely unknown. Dendrites, as well as the cell soma, are clearly stained in brown and black and can be followed in their entire length, which allowed neuroanatomists to track connections between neurons and to make visible the complex networking structure of many parts of the brain and spinal cord.

Golgi&#x27;s staining is achieved by impregnating aldehyde-fixed nervous tissue with potassium dichromate and silver nitrate. Cells thus stained are filled by microcrystallization of silver chromate.

==Technique==
According to SynapseWeb, this is the recipe for Golgi&#x27;s staining technique:

#Immerse a block (approx. 10x5 mm) of formaldehyde-fixed (or paraformaldehyde- glutaraldehyde-perfused) brain tissue into a 2% aqueous solution of potassium dichromate for 2 days
#Dry the block shortly with filter paper.
#Immerse the block into a 2% aqueous solution of silver nitrate for another 2 days.
#Cut sections approx. 20–100 μm thick.
#Dehydrate quickly in ethanol, clear and mount (e.g., into Depex or Enthalan).

This technique has since been refined to substitute the silver precipitate with gold by immersing the sample in gold chloride then oxalic acid, followed by removal of the silver by sodium thiosulphate. This preserves a greater degree of fine structure with the ultrastructural details marked by small particles of gold. 

==Quote==
Ramón y Cajal said of the Golgi method:

:&quot; I expressed the surprise which I experienced upon seeing with my own eyes the wonderful revelatory powers of the chrome-silver reaction and the absence of any excitement in the scientific world aroused by its discovery.&quot;
: &quot;Recuerdos de mi vida, Vol. 2, Historia de mi labor científica&quot;. Madrid: Moya, 1917, p. 76.

<doc id="631203" wikidata="Q1611187" url="?curid=631203" title="HMS Invincible (1869)">
<text>HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; was a Royal Navy ironclad battleship. She was built at the Napier shipyard and completed in 1870. Completed just 10 years after , she still carried sails as well as a steam engine.

==Armament==
The &quot;Audacious&quot; class was armed with ten muzzle-loading guns, supported by four muzzle loaders. These were located in a broadside pattern over a two-deck battery amidships—this was the area of the ship least affected by its motion, and made for a very stable gun platform.

==Early career==
For the first year of her career, she was a guardship at Hull, before being replaced by her sister . She was then transferred to the Mediterranean, where she served until 1886. She was sent to Cadiz in 1873 to prevent ships seized by republicans during the civil war in Spain from leaving harbour. She rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet in 1878 under the command of Captain Lindsay Brine, but her poor state of seamanship attracted the ire of the commander-in-chief, Geoffrey Hornby. In early 1879 &quot;Invincible&quot; blundered badly, putting two ships at hazard, and Brine was court-martialled. Though acquitted, Brine was relieved by Captain Edmund Fremantle. In August 1880, &quot;Invincible&quot; discovered the dismasted and abandoned Austro-Hungarian barque &quot;George Roscovich&quot; off Sardinia, Italy. She towed the barque in to Palermo, Sicily, Italy on 5 August. &quot;Invincible&quot; was Admiral Seymour&#x27;s temporary flagship at the 1882 bombardment of Alexandria because his normal one, , drew too much to enter the inner harbour. She provided men for the naval brigade that was subsequently landed and she also provided men for Lord Charles Beresford&#x27;s naval brigade in the Sudan campaign of 1885.

== Later career and shipwreck==
She made a trip to China in 1886 to carry out a new crew for &quot;Audacious&quot; before becoming the guardship at Southampton until 1893. Her engines were removed in 1901 when she became a depot ship at Sheerness for a destroyer flotilla. She was renamed HMS &quot;Erebus&quot; in 1904, a name that she bore until 1906, when she was converted into a training ship at Portsmouth for engineering artificers and was renamed &quot;Fisgard II&quot; (&quot;Audacious&quot; had been renamed &quot;Fisgard&quot; in 1904).

On 17 September 1914, she sank during a storm off Portland Bill with the loss of 21 of her crew of 64. She was being towed from Portsmouth to Scapa Flow where she was to act as a receiving ship for seamen newly mobilised for World War I. She now lies upside down with the bottom of the hull about below sea level.

HMS &quot;Fisgard II&quot; is a Designated vessel under schedule 1 of The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 (Designation of Vessels and Controlled Sites) Order 2012.

<text>Charles Coffin Little (July 25, 1799 – August 11, 1869) was an American publisher. He is best known for co-founding Little, Brown and Company with James Brown.

==Early life==
Charles Coffin Little was born on July 25, 1799, in Kennebunk, Maine.

==Career==
Little arrived in Boston early in life. He entered a shipping house, and around 1826–27 worked with booksellers Hilliard, Gray, Little &amp; Wilkins in Boston, along with William Hilliard, Harrison Gray, and John H. Wilkins. He worked there until 1837, when he formed his partnership with James Brown under the style of Charles C. Little and Company. Little and Brown had previously been clerks, and were later partners, in a bookstore in Boston founded in 1784 by Ebenezer Battelle. The name of Little and Brown&#x27;s firm was subsequently changed, due to the admission of other partners, to Little, Brown, and Co. Little was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1855.

==Personal life==
Little&#x27;s daughter, Sarah Ellen Little, married Richard Aldrich McCurdy.

==Death==
Little died on August 11, 1869, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, aged 70.

<doc id="631211" wikidata="Q3162028" url="?curid=631211" title="Janis Karpinski">
<text>Janis Leigh Karpinski ( Beam, born May 25, 1953) is a retired career officer in the United States Army Reserve. She is notable for having commanded the forces that operated Abu Ghraib and other prisons in Iraq in 2003 and 2004, at the time of the scandal related to torture and prisoner abuse. She commanded three prisons in Iraq and the forces that ran them. Her education includes a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and secondary education from Kean College, a Master of Arts degree in aviation management from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and a Master of Arts in strategic studies from the United States Army War College.

In June 2003, during the United States-led occupation of Iraq, Karpinski was given command of the 800th Military Police Brigade, which meant she was responsible for the 15 detention facilities in southern and central Iraq run by Coalition forces. Karpinski was also given command of the National Guard and Army reserve units in the Iraqi city of Mosul. In January 2004, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez formally suspended Karpinski and 16 other soldiers with undisclosed reprimands. An investigation was started into the abuse at Abu Ghraib, and Karpinski left Iraq for reasons that were explained at the time as part of &quot;routine troop rotations.&quot;

On April 8, 2005, Karpinski was formally relieved of command of the 800th Military Police Brigade. On May 5, 2005, President George W. Bush approved Karpinski&#x27;s demotion to colonel from the rank of brigadier general. Her demotion was not related officially to the abuse at Abu Ghraib.

In October 2005, she published an account of her experiences, &quot;One Woman&#x27;s Army&quot;, in which she claims that the abuses were done by contract employees trained in Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay, and sent to Abu Ghraib under orders from the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. She said her demotion was political retribution.

Since this time, some of Karpinski&#x27;s claims of top-level authorization have been confirmed by revelations of what are known as the Torture Memos, legal opinions prepared by political appointees including John Yoo in the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice. His memo of March 14, 2003, five days before the US began its invasion of Iraq, concluded that federal laws related to torture and other abuses did not apply to interrogators working overseas; it was issued to William J. Haynes, the General Counsel of DOD, and finally revealed in 2008 as a result of a Senate hearing into enhanced interrogation techniques.

==Early career==
Karpinski was commissioned into the United States Army as a second lieutenant in 1977. She served primarily in intelligence and military police assignments, training the first group of female soldiers for the United Arab Emirates, and toured supporting the Special Forces and in Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War. She was awarded a Bronze Star Medal.

In 1987, she moved from the regular Army to the Army Reserve. In the private sector, she became a consultant who ran military-styled training programs for executives.

==Marriage and family==
She is married to George Karpinski, a lieutenant colonel at the Oman US embassy.

==Iraq service==
In June 2003, during the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, Karpinski was in command of the 800th Military Police Brigade placing her in charge of the fifteen detention facilities in southern and central Iraq run by Coalition forces. She had no experience running correctional facilities. Karpinski was also given command of the National Guard and Army reserve units in the Iraqi city of Mosul who handled prisoners. Most of the forces had no training in handling prisoners, but at least two of the guardsmen later convicted of prisoner abuse had lengthy civilian experience as prison guards.

In September 2003, Karpinski led Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on a tour of the Abu Ghraib prison to demonstrate the way it had been used by Saddam Hussein to torture his enemies.

===Allegations, suspension and investigation===
In October 2003, allegations of torture in the United States-managed Iraqi prisons began to surface. Karpinski insisted that prisoners under her watch were treated &quot;humanely and fairly&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; in December 2003, Karpinski said conditions in the prison were better than many Iraqi homes, and joked that the prisoners were treated so well that she was &quot;concerned they wouldn&#x27;t want to leave.&quot;

In January 2004, Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez formally suspended Karpinski and 16 other soldiers with undisclosed reprimands. An investigation was started into the abuse. Karpinski was reassigned in what was said at the time to be part of &quot;routine troop rotations.&quot; In July 2003, Karpinski stated she had evidence Israelis were involved in interrogations.

On April 8, 2005, Karpinski was formally relieved of command of the 800th Military Police Brigade. On May 5, 2005, President Bush approved Karpinski&#x27;s demotion to Colonel from the rank of Brigadier General. Her demotion was not officially related to the abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. The allegations against her were for dereliction of duty, making a material misrepresentation to investigators, failure to obey a lawful order and shoplifting.

===Taguba Report===
In his final report, Major General Antonio Taguba blamed Karpinski for the abuse, indicating she had not paid attention to the daily operations of the prison. According to Taguba, Karpinski rarely visited the prisons during her tenure, and she reviewed and signed reports about claims of abuse without following up to make sure her orders were carried out. As a consequence, the abuse was allowed to continue and her subordinates developed a lax attitude towards protocol. Karpinski was cited throughout the Taguba Report for repeated violations of procedure and good management, and not exercising her command as directed by regulations. During interviews cited in the Taguba report, Karpinski was described as disconnected from the operations of her area of command.

Karpinski was issued a Memorandum of Admonishment by LTG Sanchez, Commander, CJTF-7, on 17 January 2004.

In April 2004, CBS&#x27; &quot;60 Minutes II&quot; broadcast photographs of Iraqi prisoners being tortured and humiliated at Abu Ghraib, which had been taken by military personnel. Following the broadcast, Karpinski was suspended from her duties and replaced by Major General Geoffrey Miller, the former commander of Camp X-Ray, part of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

===Karpinski&#x27;s defense===
Karpinski insisted she had no knowledge of the abuse and claims the particular wing of the prison was under the control of military intelligence &quot;twenty-four hours a day.&quot; She claims Army intelligence officers encouraged guards to torture prisoners as an aid to interrogation, and that she was a scapegoat.

A June 2004 BBC article said, &quot;Gen Karpinski believes the soldiers had not taken the pictures of their own accord.&quot; It quotes her as saying:

Since her suspension, Karpinski has made controversial accusations against her superiors in a series of interviews. In an interview with BBC Radio, Karpinski claimed that Major General Geoffrey Miller, who was sent from Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay to improve interrogations at the Iraqi prison, told her to treat prisoners &quot;like dogs&quot; in the sense that &quot;if you allow them to believe at any point that they are more than a dog then you&#x27;ve lost control of them&quot;. Miller denies that he ever made the remarks.

In November 2006, Karpinski told Spain&#x27;s &quot;El País&quot; newspaper she had seen a letter apparently signed by Rumsfeld that allowed civilian contractors to use techniques such as sleep deprivation during interrogation. She stated, &quot;The methods consisted of making prisoners stand for long periods, sleep deprivation ... playing music at full volume, having to sit in uncomfortably ... Rumsfeld authorized these specific techniques.&quot; According to Karpinski, Rumsfeld&#x27;s handwritten signature was above his printed name and in the same handwriting in the margin was written: &quot;Make sure this is accomplished.&quot;

There have been no comments from either the Pentagon or US army spokespeople in Iraq on Karpinski&#x27;s accusations. But, since that time, there have been revelations about the Torture Memos, including one issued by John Yoo on March 14, 2003, to the General Counsel of DOD, in which he advised that federal laws related to torture and other abuses did not apply to interrogators overseas – five days before the US invasion of Iraq.

On March 8, 2006, Karpinski gave an interview to &quot;Dateline&quot;, on the Australian SBS network. When asked who was ultimately responsible for the actions of torture and humiliation depicted in the photographs, Karpinski said:

When questioned on the findings of the Taguba Report, which stated she had shown a lack of leadership throughout the period of events, and therefore was partly responsible for what happened, Karpinski stated

In a 2004 interview for the Santa Clarita, California newspaper, &quot;The Signal&quot;, Karpinski claimed to have seen unreleased documents from Rumsfeld that authorized the use of dogs, food and sleep deprivation, and isolation for Iraqi prisoners that were also signed by General Sanchez. Both have denied authorizing such tactics. In a May 2004 military investigation of the Abu Ghraib abuses, made public in 2005 by an ACLU Freedom of Information Act request, Karpinski had said she witnessed children as young as twelve years of age incarcerated at Abu Ghraib.

<text>John Gorman (born 4 January 1936) is an English comedian, vocalist and comedy musician.

== Early life and education ==
Gorman was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire in 1936. After grammar school, Gorman worked as a telecommunications engineer.

==The Scaffold==

He was the founder of the comedy music group The Scaffold, best known for their 1968 hit single &quot;Lily the Pink&quot;, and its successor the band Grimms – the &#x27;G&#x27; in Gorman providing the &#x27;G&#x27; in Grimms. He also made a comedy musical album for DJM Records, &quot;Go Man Gorman&quot;.

During the 1970s he made brief film appearances in Frankie Howerd&#x27;s medieval set farce &quot;Up the Chastity Belt&quot; (1971), &quot;Melody&quot; (1971), Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; (1977), where he is credited as &#x27;second peasant&#x27;, and &quot;The Music Machine&quot; (1979) as a newsagent.

==Television==
He also made appearances on the British children&#x27;s television show &quot;Tiswas&quot; between 1977 and 1981 (becoming a regular member in 1978) and was one of the Four Bucketeers, a novelty band whose highest-charting single was &quot;Bucket of Water Song&quot;, which reached No. 26 in the UK Singles Chart in 1980. After &quot;Tiswas&quot;, he worked with Chris Tarrant on its adult-oriented successor &quot;O.T.T.&quot;. He then moved to Tyne Tees, first on the children&#x27;s game show &quot;How Dare You!&quot; and later on another children&#x27;s show, &quot;Razzmatazz&quot;.

After a period living in France, he returned as artistic director for the &quot;Theatre on the Steps&quot; in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England. He appeared on the Tiswas Reunited show on ITV1 on 16 June 2007. Also in 2007 he announced plans to establish a Wirral Academy of the Arts at Birkenhead Park.

On 16 April 2022, Gorman reunited once again with Bob Carolgees, Sally James and Chris Tarrant for a &quot;Tiswas&quot; reunion show at St George&#x27;s in Bristol as part of the city&#x27;s annual Slapstick Festival.

<doc id="631216" wikidata="Q1977453" url="?curid=631216" title="Second-wave feminism">
<text>Second-wave feminism was a period of feminist activity that began in the early 1960s and lasted roughly two decades, ending with the feminist sex wars in the early 1980s and being replaced by third-wave feminism in the early 1990s. It occurred throughout the Western world and aimed to increase women&#x27;s equality by building on the feminist gains of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Second-wave feminism built on first-wave feminism and broadened the scope of debate to include a wider range of issues: sexuality, family, domesticity, the workplace, reproductive rights, &quot;de facto&quot; inequalities, and official legal inequalities. First-wave feminism typically advocated for formal equality and second-wave feminism advocated for substantive equality. It was a movement focused on critiquing patriarchal or male-dominated institutions and cultural practices throughout society. Second-wave feminism also brought attention to issues of domestic violence and marital rape, created rape crisis centers and women&#x27;s shelters, and brought about changes in custody law and divorce law. Feminist-owned bookstores, credit unions, and restaurants were among the key meeting spaces and economic engines of the movement.

Because white feminists&#x27; voices have dominated the narrative from the early days of the movement, typical narratives of second-wave feminism focus on the sexism encountered by white middle- and upper-class women, with the absence of black and other women of color and the experience of working-class women, although women of color wrote and founded feminist political activist groups throughout the movement, especially in the 1970s. At the same time, some narratives present a perspective that focuses on events in the United States to the exclusion of the experiences of other countries. Writers like Audre Lorde argued that this homogenized vision of &quot;sisterhood&quot; could not lead to real change because it ignored factors of one&#x27;s identity such as race, sexuality, age, and class. The term &quot;intersectionality&quot; was coined in 1989 by Kimberlé Crenshaw at the end of the second wave. Many scholars believe that the beginning of third wave feminism was due to the problems of the second wave, rather than just another movement.

==Overview in the United States==
The second wave of feminism in the United States came as a delayed reaction against the renewed domesticity of women after World War II: the late 1940s post-war boom, which was an era characterized by an unprecedented economic growth, a baby boom, a move to family-oriented suburbs and the ideal of companionate marriages. During this time, women did not tend to seek employment due to their engagement with domestic and household duties, which was seen as their primary duty but often left them isolated within the home and estranged from politics, economics, and law making. This life was clearly illustrated by the media of the time; for example television shows such as &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; and &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; idealized domesticity.

Some important events laid the groundwork for the second wave, specifically the work of French writer Simone de Beauvoir in the 1940s where she examined the notion of women being perceived as &quot;other&quot; in the patriarchal society. Simone de Beauvoir was an existentialist, meaning she believed in the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of the will. She went on to conclude in her 1949 treatise &quot;The Second Sex&quot; that male-centered ideology was being accepted as a norm and enforced by the ongoing development of myths, and that the fact that women are capable of getting pregnant, lactating, and menstruating is in no way a valid cause or explanation to place them as the &quot;second sex&quot;. This book was translated from French to English (with some of its text excised) and published in America in 1953.

In 1960, the Food and Drug Administration approved the combined oral contraceptive pill, which was made available in 1961. This made it easier for women to have careers without having to leave due to unexpectedly becoming pregnant. It also meant young couples would not be routinely forced into unwanted marriages due to accidental pregnancies.

Though it is widely accepted that the movement lasted from the 1960s into the early 1980s, the exact years of the movement are more difficult to pinpoint and are often disputed. The movement is usually believed to have begun in 1963, when Betty Friedan published &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, and President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Presidential Commission on the Status of Women released its report on gender inequality.
The administration of President Kennedy made women&#x27;s rights a key issue of the New Frontier, and named women (such as Esther Peterson) to many high-ranking posts in his administration. Kennedy also established a Presidential Commission on the Status of Women, chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt and comprising cabinet officials (including Peterson and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy), senators, representatives, businesspeople, psychologists, sociologists, professors, activists, and public servants. The report recommended changing this inequality by providing paid maternity leave, greater access to education, and help with child care to women.

There were other actions by women in wider society, presaging their wider engagement in politics which would come with the second wave. In 1961, 50,000 women in 60 cities, mobilized by Women Strike for Peace, protested above ground testing of nuclear bombs and tainted milk.

In 1963, Betty Friedan, influenced by Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s ground-breaking, feminist &quot;The Second Sex&quot;, wrote the bestselling book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;. Discussing primarily white women, she explicitly objected to how women were depicted in the mainstream media, and how placing them at home (as &#x27;housewives&#x27;) limited their possibilities and wasted potential. She had helped conduct a very important survey using her old classmates from Smith College. This survey revealed that the women who work in the workforce while also playing a role in the home were more satisfied with their life compared with the women who stayed home. The women who stayed home showed feelings of agitation and sadness. She concluded that many of these unhappy women had immersed themselves in the idea that they should not have any ambitions outside their home. Friedan described this as &quot;The Problem That Has No Name&quot;. The perfect nuclear family image depicted and strongly marketed at the time, she wrote, did not reflect happiness and was rather degrading for women. This book is widely credited with having begun second-wave feminism in the United States. The problems of the nuclear family in America are also heteronormative and is utilized often as a marketing strategy to sell goods within a capitalist driven society.

The report from the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women, along with Friedan&#x27;s book, spoke to the discontent of many women (especially housewives) and led to the formation of local, state, and federal government women&#x27;s groups along with many independent feminist organizations. Friedan was referencing a &quot;movement&quot; as early as 1964.

The movement grew with legal victories such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; Supreme Court ruling of 1965. In 1966 Friedan joined other women and men to found the National Organization for Women (NOW); Friedan would be named as the organization&#x27;s first president.

Despite the early successes NOW achieved under Friedan&#x27;s leadership, her decision to pressure the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to use Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to enforce more job opportunities among American women met with fierce opposition within the organization. Siding with arguments among several of the group&#x27;s African-American members, many of NOW&#x27;s leaders were convinced that the vast number of male African-Americans who lived below the poverty line were in need of more job opportunities than women within the middle and upper class. Friedan stepped down as president in 1969.

In 1963, freelance journalist Gloria Steinem gained widespread popularity among feminists after a diary she authored while working undercover as a Playboy Bunny waitress at the Playboy Club was published as a two-part feature in the May and June issues of &quot;Show&quot;. In her diary, Steinem alleged the club was mistreating its waitresses in order to gain male customers and exploited the Playboy Bunnies as symbols of male chauvinism, noting that the club&#x27;s manual instructed the Bunnies that &quot;there are many pleasing ways they can employ to stimulate the club&#x27;s liquor volume&quot;. By 1968, Steinem had become arguably the most influential figure in the movement and support for legalized abortion and federally funded day-cares had become the two leading objectives for feminists.

Among the most significant legal victories of the movement after the formation of NOW were a 1967 Executive Order extending full affirmative action rights to women, a 1968 EEOC decision ruling illegal sex-segregated help wanted ads, Title IX and the Women&#x27;s Educational Equity Act (1972 and 1974, respectively, educational equality), Title X (1970, health and family planning), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (1974), the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, the outlawing of marital rape (although not outlawed in all states until 1993), and the legalization of no-fault divorce (although not legalized in all states until 2010), a 1975 law requiring the U.S. Military Academies to admit women, and many Supreme Court cases such as &quot;Reed v. Reed&quot; of 1971 and &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; of 1973. However, the changing of social attitudes towards women is usually considered the greatest success of the women&#x27;s movement. In January 2013, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced that the longtime ban on women serving in US military combat roles had been lifted.

In 2013, the US Department of Defense (DoD) announced their plan to integrate women into all combat positions by 2016.

Second-wave feminism also affected other movements, such as the civil rights movement and the student&#x27;s rights movement, as women sought equality within them. In 1965 in &quot;Sex and Caste&quot;, a reworking of a memo they had written as staffers in civil-rights organizations SNCC, Casey Hayden and Mary King proposed that &quot;assumptions of male superiority are as widespread and deep rooted and every much as crippling to the woman as the assumptions of white supremacy are to the Negro&quot;, and that in the movement, as in society, women can find themselves &quot;caught up in a common-law caste system&quot;.

In June 1967, Jo Freeman attended a &quot;free school&quot; course on women at the University of Chicago led by Heather Booth and Naomi Weisstein. She invited them to organize a woman&#x27;s workshop at the then-forthcoming National Conference of New Politics (NCNP), to be held over Labor Day weekend 1967 in Chicago. At that conference, a woman&#x27;s caucus was formed (led by Freeman and Shulamith Firestone), who tried to present their own demands to the plenary session. However, the women were told their resolution was not important enough for a floor discussion, and when through threatening to tie up the convention with procedural motions they succeeded in having their statement tacked to the end of the agenda, it was never discussed. When the National Conference for New Politics (NCNP) Director William F. Pepper refused to recognize any of the women waiting to speak and instead called on someone to speak about American Indians, five women, including Firestone, rushed the podium demanding to know why. But Willam F. Pepper allegedly patted Firestone on the head and said, &quot;Move on little girl; we have more important issues to talk about here than women&#x27;s liberation&quot;, or possibly, &quot;Cool down, little girl. We have more important things to talk about than women&#x27;s problems.&quot; Freeman and Firestone called a meeting of the women who had been at the &quot;free school&quot; course and the women&#x27;s workshop at the conference; this became the first Chicago women&#x27;s liberation group. It was known as the Westside group because it met weekly in Freeman&#x27;s apartment on Chicago&#x27;s west side. After a few months, Freeman started a newsletter which she called &quot;Voice of the women&#x27;s liberation movement.&quot; It circulated all over the country (and in a few foreign countries), giving the new movement of women&#x27;s liberation its name. Many of the women in the Westside group went on to start other feminist organizations, including the Chicago Women&#x27;s Liberation Union.

In 1968, an SDS organizer at the University of Washington told a meeting about white college men working with poor white men, and &quot;[h]e noted that sometimes after analyzing societal ills, the men shared leisure time by &#x27;balling a chick together.&#x27; He pointed out that such activities did much to enhance the political consciousness of poor white youth. A woman in the audience asked, &#x27;And what did it do for the consciousness of the chick? (Hole, Judith, and Ellen Levine, &quot;Rebirth of Feminism&quot;, 1971, pg. 120). After the meeting, a handful of women formed Seattle&#x27;s first women&#x27;s liberation group.

The term &quot;second-wave feminism&quot; itself was brought into common parlance by American journalist Martha Lear in a March 1968 &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article titled &quot;The Second Feminist Wave: What Do These Women Want?&quot;. She wrote, &quot;Proponents call it the Second Feminist Wave, the first having ebbed after the glorious victory of suffrage and disappeared, finally, into the great sandbar of Togetherness.&quot; The term &quot;wave&quot; helped link the generation of suffragettes who fought for legal rights to the feminists of the 1960s and &#x27;70s. It is now used to not only distinguish the different priorities in feminism throughout the years but to establish an overarching fight for equity and equality as a way of understanding its history. This metaphor however is critiqued by feminists as it generalizes the contradictions within the movement and the different beliefs that feminists hold.

Some black feminists who were active in the early second-wave feminism include civil rights lawyer and author Florynce Kennedy, who co-authored one of the first books on abortion, 1971&#x27;s &quot;Abortion Rap&quot;; Cellestine Ware, of New York&#x27;s Stanton-Anthony Brigade; and Patricia Robinson. These women &quot;tried to show the connections between racism and male dominance&quot; in society.

The Indochinese Women&#x27;s Conferences (IWC) in Vancouver and Toronto in 1971, demonstrated the interest of a multitude of women&#x27;s groups in the Vietnam Antiwar movement. Lesbian groups, women of color, and Vietnamese groups saw their interests mirrored in the anti-imperialist spirit of the conference. Although the IWC used a Canadian venue, membership was primarily composed of American groups.

The ideals of liberal feminism worked towards the idea of women&#x27;s equality with that of men because liberal feminists felt that women and men have the same intrinsic capabilities and that society has socialized certain skills out. This elimination of difference works to erase sexism by working within a pre-existing system of oppression rather than challenging the system itself. Working towards equality preserves a system by giving everyone the same opportunities regardless of their privilege whereas the framework of equity would address problems in society and find solutions to target the problem at hand.

The second wave of the feminist movement also marks the emergence of women&#x27;s studies as a legitimate field of study. In 1970, San Diego State University was the first university in the United States to offer a selection of women&#x27;s studies courses.

The 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston, Texas, presented an opportunity for women&#x27;s liberation groups to address a multitude of women&#x27;s issues. At the conference, delegates from around the country gathered to create a National Plan of Action, which offered 26 planks on matters such as women&#x27;s health, women&#x27;s employment, and child care. By the early 1980s, it was largely perceived that women had met their goals and succeeded in changing social attitudes towards gender roles, repealing oppressive laws that were based on sex, integrating the &quot;boys&#x27; clubs&quot; such as military academies, the United States Armed Forces, NASA, single-sex colleges, men&#x27;s clubs, and the Supreme Court, and making gender discrimination illegal. However, in 1982, adding the Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution failed, having been ratified by only 35 states, leaving it three states short of ratification.

Second-wave feminism was largely successful, with the failure of the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment and Nixon&#x27;s veto of the Comprehensive Child Development Bill of 1972 (which would have provided a multibillion-dollar national day care system) the only major legislative defeats. Efforts to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment have continued. Ten states have adopted constitutions or constitutional amendments providing that equal rights under the law shall not be denied because of sex, and most of these provisions mirror the broad language of the Equal Rights Amendment. Furthermore, many women&#x27;s groups are still active and are major political forces. , more women earn bachelor&#x27;s degrees than men, half of the Ivy League presidents are women, the numbers of women in government and traditionally male-dominated fields have dramatically increased, and in 2009 the percentage of women in the American workforce temporarily surpassed that of men. The salary of the average American woman has also increased over time, although as of 2008 it is only 77% of the average man&#x27;s salary, a phenomenon often referred to as the gender pay gap. Whether this is due to discrimination is very hotly disputed, however economists and sociologists have provided evidence to that effect.

The movement was also fought alongside the civil rights, Black power, Chicano and gay liberation movements, where many feminists were active participants throughout these fights for a voice in the United States.

Many historians view the second-wave feminist era in America as ending in the early 1980s with intra-feminism disputes of the feminist sex wars over issues such as sexuality and pornography, which ushered in the era of third-wave feminism in the early 1990s.

== &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; ==
In 1963, Betty Friedan published her book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; addressing the issues that many white-middle class housewives were facing at the time. Friedan&#x27;s work catalyzed the second wave, and in particular the liberal feminist sector of the movement. Her work gave these women the language to be able to articulate the dissatisfaction they felt in their role of being a mother and a wife. Friedan coined the term &quot;Feminine Mystique&quot; to recognize the romanticization of being a &quot;happy housewife&quot; perpetuated by media such as TV and magazines and that women should feel satisfied with housework, marriage, child-rearing, and passivity around the home unit. Women were always seen as relational to the other people in their life and were not encouraged to have their own identity as a person with their own life and interests beyond the home. They are either seen as someone&#x27;s wife or someone&#x27;s mother. Women who read her work were able to realize that they were not alone in their feelings. Friedan&#x27;s work only brought to life a problem experienced by a certain group of women however which left out women of color and who belonged to other marginalized groups since many of these people had to work outside the home for a source of income.

== Overview outside the United States ==
In 1967, at the International Alliance of Women Congress held in London, delegates were made aware of an initiative by the UN Commission on the Status of Women to study and evaluate the situation of women in their countries. Many organizations and NGOs like the Association of Business and Professional Women, Soroptimists Clubs, as well as teaching and nursing associations developed committees in response to the initiative to prepare evaluations on the conditions of women and urge their governments to establish National Commissions on the Status of Women.

In Turkey and Israel, second-wave feminism began in the 1980s.

=== Australia ===
The Regatta Hotel protest in 1965 that challenged the ban on women being served drinks in public bars in Queensland marked the beginning of second wave feminist action in Brisbane and gained significant media coverage. Kay Saunders notes, &quot;when you use the term ‘‘second wave’’ it actually started in Brisbane.&quot; In 1970 the law was changed to allow women to be served drinks in public bars in Queensland.

=== Finland ===
In the 1960s, feminism again became a part of debate in Finland after the publication of Anna-Liisa Sysiharjun&#x27;s &quot;Home, Equality and Work&quot; (1960) and Elina Haavio-Mannilan&#x27;s (1968), and the student feminist group Yhystis 9 (1966–1970) addressed issues such as the need for free abortions.

In 1970, there was a brief but strong women&#x27;s movement belonging to second wave feminism. Rape in marriage was not considered a crime at the time, and victims of domestic violence had few places to go. Feminists also fought for a day-care system that would be open to the public, and for the right for not only paid maternity leave but also paternity leave. Today there is a 263-day parental leave in Finland. It is illegal to discriminate against women in the workforce. Two feminist groups were created to help the movement: The Marxist-Feminists () and The Red Women (, ). The feminists in Finland were inspired by other European countries such as Sweden and Switzerland. Other important groups for the Finnish women in the 1970s include Unioni and The Feminists ().

=== Germany ===


During the 1960s, several German feminist groups were founded, which were characterized as the second wave.

===Ireland===
The Irish Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement was an alliance of a group of Irish women who were concerned about the sexism within Ireland both socially and legally. They first began after a meeting in Dublin&#x27;s Bewley&#x27;s Cafe on Grafton Street in 1970. They later had their meetings in Margaret Gaj&#x27;s restaurant on Baggot Street every Monday. The group was short-lived, but influential. It was initially started with twelve women, most of whom were journalists. One of the co-founders was June Levine.

In 1971, a group of Irish feminists (including June Levine, Mary Kenny, Nell McCafferty, Máirín Johnston, and other members of the Irish Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement) travelled to Belfast, Northern Ireland, on the so-called &quot;Contraceptive Train&quot; and returned with condoms, which were then illegal in Ireland.

In 1973, a group of feminists, chaired by Hilda Tweedy of the Irish Housewives Association, set up the Council for the Status of Women, with the goal of gaining equality for women. It was an umbrella body for women&#x27;s groups. During the 1990s the council&#x27;s activities included supporting projects funded by the European Social Fund, and running Women and Leadership Programmes and forums. In 1995, following a strategic review, it changed its name to the National Women&#x27;s Council of Ireland.

=== Spain ===
The 1960s in Spain saw a generational shift in Spanish feminist in response to other changes in Spanish society. This included increased emigration and tourism (resulting in the spread of ideas from the rest of the world), greater opportunities in education and employment for women and major economic reforms. Feminism in the late Franco period and early transition period was not unified. It had many different political dimensions, however, they all shared a belief in the need for greater equality for women in Spain and a desire to defend the rights of women. Feminism moved from being about the individual to being about the collective. It was during this period that second-wave feminism arrived in Spain.

Second-wave Spanish feminism was about the struggle for the rights of women in the context of the dictatorship. PCE would start in 1965 to promote this movement with MDM, creating a feminist political orientation around building solidarity for women and assisting imprisoned political figures. MDM launched its movement in Madrid by establishing associations among the housewives of the Tetuán and Getafe in 1969. In 1972, Asociación Castellana de Amas de Casa y Consumidora was created to widen the group&#x27;s ability to attract members.

Second-wave feminism entered the Spanish comic community by the early 1970s. It was manifested in Spanish comics in two ways. The first was that it increased the number of women involved in comics production as writers and artists. The second was it transformed how female characters were portrayed, making women less passive and less likely to be purely sexual beings.

=== Sweden ===
:&quot;See also Feminism in Sweden&quot;
In Sweden, second-wave feminism is mostly associated with Group 8, a feminist organization which was founded by eight women in Stockholm in 1968.

The organization took up various feminist issues such as demands for expansions of kindergartens, 6-hour working day, equal pay for equal work and opposition to pornography. Initially based in Stockholm, local groups were founded throughout the country. The influence of Group 8 on feminism in Sweden is still prevalent.

=== The Netherlands ===
In 1967, &quot;The Discontent of Women&quot;, by Joke Kool-Smits, was published; the publication of this essay is often regarded as the start of second-wave feminism in the Netherlands. In this essay, Smit describes the frustration of married women, saying they are fed up being solely mothers and housewives.

== Beginning and consciousness raising ==
The beginnings of second-wave feminism can be studied by looking at the two branches that the movement formed in: the liberal feminists and the radical feminists. The liberal feminists, led by figures such as Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem advocated for federal legislation to be passed that would promote and enhance the personal and professional lives of women. On the other hand, radical feminists, such as Casey Hayden and Mary King, adopted the skills and lessons that they had learned from their work with student organizations such as the Students for a Democratic Society and Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and created a platform to speak on the violent and sexist issues women faced while working with the larger Civil Rights Movement.

=== The liberal feminist movement ===

After being removed from the workforce, by either personal or social pressures, many women in the post-war America returned to the home or were placed into female only jobs in the service sector. After the publication of Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; in 1963, many women connected to the feeling of isolation and dissatisfaction that the book detailed. The book itself, however, was not a call to action, but rather a plea for self-realization and consciousness raising among middle-class women throughout America. Many of these women organized to form the National Organization for Women in 1966, whose &quot;Statement of Purpose&quot; declared that the right women had to equality was one small part of the nationwide civil rights revolution that was happening during the 1960s.

=== The radical feminist movement ===

Women who favoured radical feminism collectively spoke of being forced to remain silent and obedient to male leaders in New Left organizations. They spoke out about how they were not only told to do clerical work such as stuffing envelopes and typing speeches, but there was also an expectation for them to sleep with the male activists that they worked with. While these acts of sexual harassment took place, the young women were neglected their right to have their own needs and desires recognized by their male cohorts. Many radical feminists had learned from these organizations how to think radically about their self-worth and importance, and applied these lessons in the relationships they had with each other.

== Businesses ==
Feminist activists have established a range of feminist businesses, including women&#x27;s bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, feminist restaurants, and feminist record labels. These businesses flourished as part of the second and third waves of feminism in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.

In West Berlin sixteen projects emerged within three years (1974–76) all without state funding (except the women&#x27;s shelter). Many of those new concepts the social economy picked up later, some are still run autonomously today.

== Music and popular culture ==
Second-wave feminists viewed popular culture as sexist, and created pop culture of their own to counteract this. &quot;One project of second wave feminism was to create &#x27;positive&#x27; images of women, to act as a counterweight to the dominant images circulating in popular culture and to raise women&#x27;s consciousness of their oppressions.&quot;

=== &quot;I Am Woman&quot; ===
Australian artist Helen Reddy&#x27;s 1972 song &quot;I Am Woman&quot; played a large role in popular culture and became a feminist anthem; Reddy came to be known as a &quot;feminist poster girl&quot; or a &quot;feminist icon&quot;. Reddy told interviewers that the song was a &quot;song of pride about being a woman&quot;. A few weeks after &quot;I Am Woman&quot; entered the charts, radio stations refused to play it. Some music critics and radio stations believed the song represented &quot;all that is silly in the Women&#x27;s Lib Movement&quot;. Helen Reddy then began performing the song on numerous television variety shows. As the song gained popularity, women began calling radio stations and requesting to hear &quot;I Am Woman&quot; played. The song re-entered the charts and reached number one in December 1972. &quot;I Am Woman&quot; also became a protest song that women sang at feminist rallies and protests.

=== Olivia Records ===

In 1973, a group of five feminists created the first women&#x27;s owned-and-operated record label, called Olivia Records. They created the record label because they were frustrated that major labels were slow to add female artists to their rosters. One of Olivia&#x27;s founders, Judy Dlugacz, said that, &quot;It was a chance to create opportunities for women artists within an industry which at that time had few.&quot; Initially, they had a budget of $4,000, and relied on donations to keep Olivia Records alive. With these donations, Olivia Records created their first LP, an album of feminist songs entitled &quot;I Know You Know.&quot; The record label originally relied on volunteers and feminist bookstores to distribute their records, but after a few years their records began to be sold in mainstream record stores.

Olivia Records was so successful that the company relocated from Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles in 1975. Olivia Records released several records and albums, and their popularity grew. As their popularity grew, an alternative, specialized music industry grew around it. This type of music was initially referred to as &quot;lesbian music&quot; but came to be known as &quot;women&#x27;s music&quot;. However, although Olivia Records was initially meant for women, in the 1980s it tried to move away from that stereotype and encouraged men to listen to their music as well.

=== Women&#x27;s music ===

Women&#x27;s music consisted of female musicians combined music with politics to express feminist ideals. Cities throughout the United States began to hold Women&#x27;s Music Festivals, all consisting of female artists singing their own songs about personal experiences. The first Women&#x27;s Music Festival was held in 1974 at the University of Illinois. In 1979, the Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival attracted 10,000 women from across America. These festivals encouraged already-famous female singers, such as Laura Nyro and Ellen McIllwaine, to begin writing and producing their own songs instead of going through a major record label. Many women began performing hard rock music, a traditionally male-dominated genre. One of the most successful examples included the sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson, who formed the famous hard rock band Heart.

=== Film ===

==== German-speaking Europe ====
The Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin gave women a chance in film in Germany: from 1968 on one third of the students were female. Some of them - pioneers of the women&#x27;s movement - produced feminist feature films: Helke Sander in 1971 produced &quot;Eine Prämie für Irene&quot; [A Reward for Irene], and Cristina Perincioli (although she was Swiss not German) in 1971 produced &quot;Für Frauen – 1.Kap&quot; [For Women – 1st Chapter].

In West Germany Helma Sanders-Brahms and Claudia von Alemann produced feminist documentaries from 1970 on.

In 1973, Claudia von Alemann and Helke Sander organized the 1. Internationale Frauen-Filmseminar in Berlin.

In 1974, Helke Sander founded the journal &quot;Frauen und Film&quot; – a first feminist film journal, which she edited until 1981.

In the 1970s in West Germany, women directors produced a whole series of Frauenfilm - films focusing on women&#x27;s personal emancipation. In the 1980s the Goethe Institute brought a collection of German women&#x27;s films to every corner of the world.
&quot;...here the term &#x27;feminist filmmaking&#x27; does function to point to a filmmaking practice defining itself outside the masculine mirror. German feminism is one of the most active women&#x27;s movements in Europe. It has gained access to television; engendered a spectrum of journals, a publishing house and a summer women&#x27;s university in Berlin; inspired a whole group of filmmakers; ...&quot; writes Marc Silberman in &quot;Jump Cut&quot;. But most of the women filmmakers did not see themselves as feminists, except Helke Sander and Cristina Perincioli. Perincioli stated in an interview: &quot;Fight first ... before making beautiful art&quot;. There, she explains how she develops and shoots the film together with the women concerned: saleswomen, battered wives - and why she prefers to work with an all female team. Camera women were still so rare in the 1970 that she had to find them in Denmark and France. Working with an all women film crew Perincioli encouraged women to learn these then male dominated professions.

===== Association of women filmworkers of Germany =====
In 1979, German women filmworkers formed the Association of women filmworkers which was active for a few years. In 2014, a new attempt with Proquote Film (then as Proquote Regie) turned out to be successful and effective.
A study by the University of Rostock shows that 42% of the graduates of film schools are female, but only 22% of the German feature films are staged by a woman director and are usually financially worse equipped. Similarly, women are disadvantaged in the other male-dominated film trades, where men even without education are preferred to the female graduates.
The initiative points out that the introduction of a quota system in Sweden has brought the proportion of women in key positions in film production around the same as the population share. As a result, the Swedish initiative calls also for a parity of film funding bodies and the implementation of a gradual women&#x27;s quota for the allocation of film and television directing jobs in order to achieve a gender-equitable distribution. This should reflect the plurality of a modern society, because diversity can not be guaranteed if more than 80% of all films are produced by men.
ProQuote Film is the third initiative with which women with a high share in their industry are fighting for more female executives and financial resources (see Pro Quote Medien (2012) and Quote Medizin).

==== United States ====
In the US, both the creation and subjects of motion pictures began to reflect second-wave feminist ideals, leading to the development of feminist film theory. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, female filmmakers that were involved in part of the new wave of feminist film included Joan Micklin Silver (&quot;Between the Lines&quot;), Claudia Weill (&quot;Girlfriends&quot;), Stephanie Rothman, and Susan Seidelman (&quot;Smithereens&quot;, &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;). Other notable films that explored feminist subject matters that were made at this time include the 1968 film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; and the 1971 film adaptation of Lois Gould&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;Such Good Friends&quot;.

The 2014 documentary &quot;She&#x27;s Beautiful When She&#x27;s Angry&quot; was the first documentary film to cover feminism&#x27;s second wave.

=== Art ===
Art during second wave feminism also flourished. Known as the Feminist art movement, the works and artists during the movement fought to give themselves representation in a field dominated by white men. Their works came in all different mediums and aimed to end oppression, challenge gender norms, and highlight the fraught art industry rooted in white patriarchy. Linda Nochlin&#x27;s essay &quot;Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?&quot; (1971) has become one of the most influential works that came from the movement and questions gender stereotypes for women in the art field as well as the definition of art as a whole.

== Social changes ==
===Use of birth control===
Finding a need to talk about the advantage of the Food and Drug Administration passing their approval for the use of birth control in 1960, liberal feminists took action in creating panels and workshops with the goal to promote conscious raising among sexually active women. These workshops also brought attention to issues such as venereal diseases and safe abortion. Radical feminists also joined this push to raise awareness among sexually active women. While supporting the &quot;Free Love Movement&quot; of the late 1960s and early 1970s, young women on college campuses distributed pamphlets on birth control, sexual diseases, abortion, and cohabitation.

While white women were concerned with obtaining birth control for all, women of color were at risk of sterilization because of these same medical and social advances: &quot;Native American, African American, and Latina groups documented and publicized sterilization abuses in their communities in the 1960s and 70s, showing that women had been sterilized without their knowledge or consent... In the 1970s, a group of women... founded the Committee to End Sterilization Abuse (CESA) to stop this racist population control policy begun by the federal government in the 1940s – a policy that had resulted in the sterilization of over one-third of all women of child-bearing age in Puerto Rico.&quot; The use of forced sterilization disproportionately affected women of color and women from lower socioeconomic statuses. Sterilization was often done under the ideology of eugenics. Thirty states within the United States authorized legal sterilizations under eugenic sciences.

===Domestic violence and sexual harassment===
The second-wave feminist movement also took a strong stance against physical violence and sexual assault in both the home and the workplace. In 1968, NOW successfully lobbied the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to pass an amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prevented discrimination based on sex in the workplace. This attention to women&#x27;s rights in the workplace also prompted the EEOC to add sexual harassment to its &quot;Guidelines on Discrimination&quot;, therefore giving women the right to report their bosses and coworkers for acts of sexual assault.

Domestic violence, such as battery and rape, were rampant in post-war America. Married women were often abused by their husbands, and as late as 1975 domestic battery and rape were both socially acceptable and legal as women were seen to be the possessions of their husbands. Because of activists in the second-wave feminist movement, and the local law enforcement agencies that they worked with, by 1982 three hundred shelters and forty-eight state coalitions had been established to provide protection and services for women who had been abused by male figures in their lives.

== Sex and sexuality ==
During the time of the second wave, with fighting against the stereotype that women are supposed to be passive and submissive, this topic extended to women&#x27;s pleasure regarding sex, emotion, and intimacy. In anatomy textbooks and works by authors including neurologist Sigmund Freud before the 1950s, women&#x27;s bodies in regards to sexuality and sexual intercourse were left out of the public eye and were instead centered around male pleasure. Through works like Anne Koedt&#x27;s &quot;The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm&quot; written in 1970, people could begin to break down the societal norm for male pleasure with a focus on the vaginal orgasm in heterosexual relationships.

In 1978, author Audre Lorde also discussed this in her essay &quot;Uses of the Erotic: The Erotic as Power&quot;. Lorde believed that the erotic is something that has been suppressed in women in order to keep them from feeling to their full potential in hopes of keeping them subservient. It is labeled as irrational and trivial so that women do not understand its full potential for power. Pornography to Lorde suppresses genuine emotion as it is only about the simulation of the senses.

The magazine &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; also decided to rebrand their company as a women&#x27;s magazine in 1965 coinciding with the second wave feminist movement. The editor in chief, Helen Gurley Brown, dedicated the magazine to focus on the modern, working, and independent woman so that they can find independence in themselves and embrace their sexuality. The articles are however criticized by many for its unrealistic portrayal of women and how ultimately, the woman curated by the magazine end up playing into men&#x27;s fantasies about what a woman should be. It is another form of control and rules for women to abide by. This kind of criticism was especially touched on by Naomi Wolf&#x27;s &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot; in 1990.

With emotion and the ability to be able to feel to the fullest extent for women, that comes with the idea of separate space. The need to find women-only space so that feminists can organize and work towards liberation. In advocating for these spaces, many accused them of being &quot;radical - separatists&quot; and/or &quot;lesbians&quot;. Homophobia was also, and still is, very prevalent and while the intersectional experiences were not completely researched until years later, homophobia and sexism were always interconnected. With the gay liberation movement and the second wave, people were afraid of the questions that both movements addressed that would change the foundation of a heterosexual, oppressive patriarchy. Lorde speaks of this fear in her work &quot;Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference&quot; (1980) where she writes about how lesbians challenge the patriarchy and heteronormative society by creating a fear of a society that is no longer dependent on men.

==Education==

===Title IX===
===Coeducation===
One debate which developed in the United States during this time period revolved around the question of coeducation. Most men&#x27;s colleges in the United States adopted coeducation, often by merging with women&#x27;s colleges. In addition, some women&#x27;s colleges adopted coeducation, while others maintained a single-sex student body.

====Seven Sisters Colleges====
Two of the Seven Sister colleges made transitions during and after the 1960s. The first, Radcliffe College, merged with Harvard University. Beginning in 1963, students at Radcliffe received Harvard diplomas signed by the presidents of Radcliffe and Harvard and joint commencement exercises began in 1970. The same year, several Harvard and Radcliffe dormitories began swapping students experimentally and in 1972 full co-residence was instituted. The departments of athletics of both schools merged shortly thereafter. In 1977, Harvard and Radcliffe signed an agreement which put undergraduate women entirely in Harvard College. In 1999, Radcliffe College was dissolved and Harvard University assumed full responsibility over the affairs of female undergraduates. Radcliffe is now the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Women&#x27;s Studies at Harvard University.

The second, Vassar College, declined an offer to merge with Yale University and instead became coeducational in 1969.

The remaining Seven Sisters decided against coeducation. Mount Holyoke College engaged in a lengthy debate under the presidency of David Truman over the issue of coeducation. On November 6, 1971, &quot;after reviewing an exhaustive study on coeducation, the board of trustees decided unanimously that Mount Holyoke should remain a women&#x27;s college, and a group of faculty was charged with recommending curricular changes that would support the decision.&quot; Smith College also made a similar decision in 1971.

In 1969, Bryn Mawr College and Haverford College (then all male) developed a system of sharing residential colleges. When Haverford became coeducational in 1980, Bryn Mawr discussed the possibly of coeducation as well, but decided against it. In 1983, Columbia University began admitting women after a decade of failed negotiations with Barnard College for a merger along the lines of Harvard and Radcliffe (Barnard has been affiliated with Columbia since 1900, but it continues to be independently governed). Wellesley College also decided against coeducation during this time.

====Mississippi University for Women====
In 1982, in a 5–4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan&quot; that the Mississippi University for Women would be in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause if it denied admission to its nursing program on the basis of gender. Mississippi University for Women, the first public or government institution for women in the United States, changed its admissions policies and became coeducational after the ruling.

In what was her first opinion written for the Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor stated, &quot;In limited circumstances, a gender-based classification favoring one sex can be justified if it intentionally and directly assists members of the sex that is disproportionately burdened.&quot; She went on to point out that there are a disproportionate number of women who are nurses, and that denying admission to men &quot;lends credibility to the old view that women, not men, should become nurses, and makes the assumption that nursing is a field for women a self-fulfilling prophecy&quot;.

In the dissenting opinions, Justices Harry A. Blackmun, Warren E. Burger, Lewis F. Powell, Jr., and William H. Rehnquist suggested that the result of this ruling would be the elimination of publicly supported single-sex educational opportunities. This suggestion has proven to be accurate as there are no public women&#x27;s colleges in the United States today and, as a result of &quot;United States v. Virginia&quot;, the last all-male public university in the United States, Virginia Military Institute, was required to admit women. The ruling did not require the university to change its name to reflect its coeducational status and it continues a tradition of academic and leadership development for women by providing liberal arts and professional education to women and men.

==== Mills College ====
On May 3, 1990, the Trustees of Mills College announced that they had voted to admit male students. This decision led to a two-week student and staff strike, accompanied by numerous displays of nonviolent protests by the students. At one point, nearly 300 students blockaded the administrative offices and boycotted classes. On May 18, the Trustees met again to reconsider the decision, leading finally to a reversal of the vote.

==== Other colleges ====
Sarah Lawrence College declined an offer to merge with Princeton University, becoming coeducational in 1969. Connecticut College also adopted coeducation during the late 1960s.
Wells College, previously with a student body of women only, became co-educational in 2005. Douglass College, part of Rutgers University, was the last publicly funded women&#x27;s only college until 2007 when it became coed.

== Criticism ==
Some black and/or working class and poor women felt alienated by the main planks of the second-wave feminist movement, which largely advocated women&#x27;s right to work outside the home and expansion of reproductive rights. Women of color and poor white women in the U.S. had been working outside of the home in blue-collar and service jobs for generations. Additionally, Angela Davis wrote that while Afro-American women and white women were subjected to multiple unwilled pregnancies and had to clandestinely abort, Afro-American women were also suffering from compulsory sterilization programs that were not widely included in dialogue about reproductive justice.

Beginning in the late 20th century, numerous feminist scholars such as Audre Lorde and Winona LaDuke critiqued the second wave in the United States as reducing feminist activity into a homogenized and whitewashed chronology of feminist history that ignores the voices and contributions of many women of color, working-class women, and LGBT women.

The second-wave feminist movement in the United States has been criticized for failing to acknowledge the struggles of women of color, and their voices were often silenced or ignored by white feminists. It has been suggested that the dominant historical narratives of the feminist movement focuses on white, East Coast, and predominantly middle-class women and women&#x27;s consciousness-raising groups, excluding the experiences and contributions of lesbians, women of color, and working-class and lower-class women. Chela Sandoval called the dominant narratives of the women&#x27;s liberation movement &quot;hegemonic feminism&quot; because it essentializes the feminist historiography to an exclusive population of women, which assumes that all women experience the same oppressions as the white, East Coast, and predominantly middle-class women. Multiracial feminist theory also confronts the second-wave feminist movement&#x27;s focus on white middle-class women by arguing that it neglected the interplay between racism and misogyny. This restricting view purportedly ignored the oppressions women face determined by their race, class, and sexuality, and gave rise to women-of-color feminisms that separated from the women&#x27;s liberation movement, such as Black feminism, Africana womanism, and the Hijas de Cuauhtémoc that emerged at California State University, Long Beach, which was founded by Anna Nieto-Gómez, due to the Chicano Movement&#x27;s sexism. Kimberlé Crenshaw coined the term &quot;intersectionality&quot; in 1989 in response to the white, middle-class views that dominated second-wave feminism. Intersectionality describes the way systems of oppression (i.e. sexism, racism) have multiplicative, not additive, effects, on those who are multiply marginalized. It has become a core tenet of third-wave feminism.

Many feminist scholars see the generational division of the second wave as problematic. Second wavers are typically essentialized as the Baby Boomer generation, when in actuality many feminist leaders of the second wave were born before World War II ended. This generational essentialism homogenizes the group that belongs to the wave and asserts that every person part of a certain demographic generation shared the same ideologies, because ideological differences were considered to be generational differences.

Feminist scholars, particularly those from the late 20th and early 21st centuries to the present day, have revisited diverse writings, oral histories, artwork, and artifacts of women of color, working-class women, and lesbians during the early 1960s to the early 1980s to decenter what they view as the dominant historical narratives of the second wave of the women&#x27;s liberation movement, allowing the scope of the historical understanding of feminist consciousness to expand and transform. By recovering histories that they believe have been erased and overlooked, these scholars purport to establish what Maylei Blackwell termed &quot;retrofitted memory&quot;. Blackwell describes this as a form of &quot;countermemory&quot; that creates a transformative and fluid &quot;alternative archive&quot; and space for women&#x27;s feminist consciousness within &quot;hegemonic narratives&quot;. For Blackwell, looking within the gaps and crevices of the second wave allows fragments of historical knowledge and memory to be discovered, and new historical feminist subjects as well as new perspectives about the past to emerge, forcing existing dominant histories that claim to represent a universal experience to be decentered and refocused.

<text>Sir Thomas de Littleton or de Lyttleton [[Thomas de Littleton|KB]] [[Serjeant-at-law|SL]](c. 1407–23 August 1481) was an English judge, undersheriff, Lord of Tixall Manor, and legal writer from the Lyttelton family. He was also made a Knight of the Bath by King Edward IV.

==Early life==
Thomas de Littleton was the eldest son of Elizabeth Littleton, sole daughter and heiress of Thomas de Littleton, Lord of Frankley, Worcestershire, and Thomas Westcote or Heuster, esquire, chief prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas. The date of Littleton&#x27;s birth is uncertain; a MS. pedigree gives 1422, but it was probably earlier than this. If, as is generally accepted, he was born at Frankley Manor, it could not have been before 1407, in which year Littleton&#x27;s grandfather recovered the manor from a distant branch of the family. 

Elizabeth Littleton and Thomas Westcote had four sons. Thomas, the eldest son and heir, took his mother&#x27;s surname, likely as a condition of her marriage settlement, as heir to the manor of Frankley. Two of his brothers, Nicholas and Guy, retained the surname Westcote. Nicholas Westcote married Agnes Vernon, the daughter and heiress of Edmund Vernon, and was an ancestor of the Westcotes of Staffordshire, while Guy Westcote married the daughter of one Greenevill of Gloucestershire and was an ancestor of the Westcotes of Devon and Somerset. 

==Career==
He attended the grammar school attached to the monastery in Worcester. Thus, he is cherished as an alumnus by both descendant educational institutions, today&#x27;s Royal Grammar School Worcester and The King&#x27;s School Worcester. He is said by Sir Edward Coke to have &quot;attended one of the universities,&quot; but there is no corroboration of this statement. 

He was probably a member of the Inner Temple and lectured there on the statute of Westminster, i.e., Donis Conditionalibus. His name appears in the Paston Letters (ed. J. Gairdner, p. 60) about 1445 as that of a well-known counsel, and in 1481/2 he received a grant of the manor of Sheriff Hales, Shropshire, from Sir William Trussell as a reward for his services as counsel. . 

Sometime before 1468, he purchased Tixall Manor from John Merston, who married an heiress of the De Wasteney family who had previously owned the manor. After Littleton&#x27;s death, his granddaughter Joan inherited the manor. She married Sir John Aston of Haywood, and the manor would remain in the hands of the Aston family for many generations.

He appears to have been Recorder of Coventry in 1450; he was made Escheator of Worcestershire, and in 1447/8 he was under-sheriff of the same county; he became sergeant-at-law in 1453 and was afterwards a Justice of Assize on the northern circuit. In 1466, he was made a judge of the common pleas and, in 1475, a knight of the Bath. 

He died, according to the inscription on his tomb in Worcester Cathedral, on August 23, 1481. 

==Marriage and issue==
Littleton married, before Easter term 1447, Joan Burley (died 22 March 1505), widow of Sir Philip Chetwynd (died 10 May 1444) of Ingestre, Staffordshire, and daughter and coheiress of William Burley, esquire, Speaker of the House of Commons, of Broncroft in Corvedale, Shropshire, by his first wife, Ellen Grendon, daughter and co-heiress of John de Grendon of Gayton, by whom he had three sons and two daughters: 

* Sir William Littleton (1450–1507), knighted after the Battle of Stoke, was a lawyer at the Inner Temple. He married first Ellen Walsh, daughter of William Walsh of Wanlip, and then Mary Byron, daughter and coheir of Richard Byron of Clayton, by whom he had a daughter, Joan Littleton, who married Sir John Aston of Haywood. He married secondly Mary Whittington, the daughter of William Whittington of Pauntley, Gloucestershire, by whom he had his son and heir, John Littleton (c. 1499–17 May 1532), and a daughter, Anne Littleton, who married Thomas Rouse of Ragley in Warwickshire. By an unknown mistress, he had an illegitimate son, William Littleton &quot;alias&quot; Lodge, who was the father of Sir Thomas Lodge, Lord Mayor of London. 
* Richard Littleton (died 1517) was a lawyer at the Inner Temple. He married Alice Winnesbury. 
* Thomas Littleton (died 1524) was a lawyer at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He married Anne Botreaux. 
* Ellen Littleton died unmarried. 
* Alice Littleton died unmarried. 

Through his three sons, he became an ancestor of the families holding the peerages of Cobham (formerly Lyttelton) and Hatherton. His eldest son and heir, Sir William Littleton, became an ancestor of the Lyttelton Baronets, who later acquired the title Baron Lyttelton of Frankley. His second son, Richard Littleton, became the founder of another wealthy dynasty, later to become the Littleton Baronets and later Barons Hatherton, through marriage into the Wynnesbury family of Pillaton Hall, near Penkridge, Staffordshire. His youngest son Thomas&#x27;s descendants became another line of Littleton baronets, named for Stoke Milburgh, Shropshire.

==&quot;Treatise on Tenures&quot;==

===Background===
His &quot;Treatise on Tenures&quot; was probably written after he had been appointed to the bench. According to tradition it is addressed to his second son, Richard, who went to the bar, and whose name occurs in the year books of the reign of Henry VII; it has however been argued that the words &quot;mon filz&quot; (my son) were simply a conventional way of addressing law students. The book, both historically and from its intrinsic merit, may be characterised as the first text-book upon the English law of property. The law of property in Littleton&#x27;s time was mainly concerned with rights over land, and it was the law relating to this class of rights that Littleton set himself to digest and classify. The time was ripe for the task: ever since the Norman conquest, regular courts of justice had been at work administering a law that had grown out of an of Teutonic custom and of Norman feudalism.

Under Henry II, the courts had been organised, and the practice of keeping regular records of the proceedings had been carefully observed. The centralising influence of the royal courts and of the justices of assize, working steadily through three centuries, had made the rules governing the law of property uniform throughout the land; local customs were confined within certain prescribed limits, and were only recognised as giving rise to certain well defined classes of rights, such, for instance, as the security of tenure acquired by villains by virtue of the custom of the manor, and the rights of freeholders, in some towns, to dispose of their land by will. Thus, by the time of Littleton (Henry VI and Edward IV), an immense mass of material had been acquired and preserved in the rolls of the various courts. Reports of important cases were published in the &quot;year books&quot;. A glance at Statham&#x27;s Abridgment, the earliest digest of decided cases, published nearly at the same time as Littleton&#x27;s Tenures, is sufficient to show the enormous bulk that reported cases had already attained as materials for the knowledge of English law.

===Language===
Littleton&#x27;s treatise was written in that peculiar dialect compounded of Norman French and English phrases called &quot;law French&quot;. Although it had been provided by a statute of Edward III that &quot;viva voce&quot; proceedings in court should no longer be conducted in the French tongue, &quot;which was much unknown in the realm,&quot; the practice of reporting proceedings in that language and of using it in legal treatises lingered till a much later period and was, at length, prohibited by a statute passed in the time of the Commonwealth in 1650. 

===Sources===
Unlike the preceding writers on English law, Glanville, Bracton, and the authors of the treatises known by the names of Britton and Fleta, Littleton borrows nothing from the sources of Roman law or the commentators. He deals exclusively with English law.

The first two books are stated, in a note to the table at the conclusion of the work, to have been made for the better understanding of certain chapters of the &quot;Ancient Book of Tenures.&quot; This refers to a tract called The Old Tenures, said to have been written in the reign of Edward III. By way of distinguishing it from this work, Littleton&#x27;s book is called in all the early editions &quot;Tenores Novelli.&quot; 

===Method===
The book is written on a definite system and is the first attempt at a scientific classification of rights over land. Littleton&#x27;s method is to begin with a definition, usually clearly and briefly expressed, of the class of rights with which he is dealing. He then proceeds to illustrate the various characteristics and incidents of the class by stating particular instances, some of which refer to decisions that had actually occurred, but more of which are hypothetical cases put by way of illustration of his principles. He occasionally refers to reported cases. His book is thus much more than a mere digest of judicial decisions; to some extent, he pursues the method that gave Roman law its breadth and consistency of principle. In Roman law, this result was attained through the practice of putting hypothetical cases to jurisconsults hypothetical cases to be solved by them. Littleton, in like manner, is constantly stating and solving, by reference to principles of law, cases that may or may not have occurred in actual practice.

===Contents===
In dealing with freehold estates, Littleton adopts a classification that has been followed by all writers who have attempted to systematize the English law of land, especially Sir Matthew Hale and Sir William Blackstone. It is indeed the only possible approach to a scientific arrangement of the intricate &quot;estates in land&quot; that were known to English law. He classifies estates in land by reference to their duration, or, in other words, by reference to the differences between the persons who are entitled to succeed upon the death of the person in possession, or &quot;tenant.&quot; 

First of all, he describes the characteristics of tenancy in simple terms. In Littleton&#x27;s time and until the present day, it was the largest interest in land known to the law. Next in order comes tenancy in fee tail, the various classes of which are sketched by Littleton with brevity and accuracy, but he is silent as to the important practice, which first received judicial recognition shortly before his death, of &quot;suffering a recovery,&quot; whereby, through a series of judicial fictions, a tenant in fee tail was enabled to convert his estate tail into a fee simple, thus acquiring full power of alienation. 

After discussing, in their logical order, other freehold interests in land, he passes to interests in land that were called by later writers interests less than freehold, namely, tenancies for terms of years and tenancies at will. With the exception of tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us but which was a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book is a complete statement of the principles of the common law, as they, for the most part, existed until 1925, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks the exact point at which the tenant—by copy-of-court-roll, the successor of the villein, who, in his turn, represented the freeman reduced to villeinage by the growth of the manorial system—acquired security of tenure. 

The second book relates to the reciprocal rights and duties of lord and tenant and is mainly of historical interest to the modern lawyer. It contains a complete statement of the law as it stood in Littleton&#x27;s time relating to homage, fealty, and escuage, the money compensation to be paid to the lord in lieu of military service to be rendered to the king, a peculiar characteristic of English as distinguished from Continental feudalism. 

Littleton then proceeds to notice the important features of tenure by knight&#x27;s service, with its distinguishing incidents of the right of wardship of the lands and person of the infant heir or heiress, and the right of disposing of the ward in marriage. The non-military freehold tenures are next dealt with: we have an account of &quot;socage tenure,&quot; into which all military tenures were subsequently commuted by a now unrecognized act of the Long Parliament in 1650, afterwards reënacted by the well-known statute of Charles II (1660), and of &quot;frankalmoign&quot;, or the spiritual tenure by which churchmen held. 

In the description of burgage tenure and tenure in villeinage, the life of which consists in the validity of ancient customs recognized by law, we recognize survivals of a time before the iron rule of feudalism had molded the law of land in the interests of the king and the great lords. Finally, he deals with the law of rents, discussing the various kinds of rents that may be reserved to the grantor upon a grant of lands and the remedies for recovery of rent, especially the remedy of distress. 

The third and concluding book of Littleton&#x27;s treatise deals mainly with the various ways in which rights over land can be acquired and terminated in the case of a single possessor or several possessors. This leads him to discuss the various modes in which several persons may simultaneously have rights over the same land, such as parceners (daughters who are co-heiresses, or sons in gavelkind), joint tenants, and tenants in common. 

Next follows an elaborate discussion of what are called estates upon condition—a class of interests that occupied a large space in the early common law, giving rise, on one side, to estates tail and, on the other, to mortgages. In Littleton&#x27;s time, a mortgage, which he carefully describes, was merely a conveyance of land by the tenant to the mortgagee, with a condition that, if the tenant paid the mortgagee a certain sum on a certain day, he might return and have the land again. If the condition was not fulfilled, the interest of the mortgagee became absolute, and Littleton gives no indication of any modification of this strict rule, such as was introduced by courts of equity, permitting the debtor to redeem his land by payment of all that was due to the mortgagee, although the day of payment had passed and his interest had become, at law, indefeasible. The remainder of the work is occupied with an exposition of a miscellaneous class of modes of acquiring rights to property, the analysis of which would occupy too much space. 

The work is thus a complete summary of the common law as it stood at the time. It is nearly silent as to the remarkable class of rights that had already assumed vast practical importance—equitable interests in lands. These are only noticed incidentally in the chapter on &quot;Releases.&quot; But it was already clear in Littleton&#x27;s time that this class of rights would become the most important of all. 

Littleton&#x27;s own will, which has been preserved, may be adduced as proof of this assertion. Although nothing was more opposed to the spirit of Norman feudalism than that a tenant of lands should dispose of them by will, we find Littleton directing, by his own will, the &quot;feoffees&quot; (trustees) of certain manors to make estates to the persons named in his will. In other words, in order to acquire over lands powers unknown to the common law, the lands had been conveyed to feoffees who had full right over them according to the common law, but who were under a conscientious obligation to exercise those rights at the direction and for the exclusive benefit of the person to whose &quot;use&quot; the lands were held. This conscientious obligation was recognized and enforced by the Lord Chancellor, and thus arose the class of equitable interests in lands. Littleton was the first writer on English law after these rights had risen into a prominent position, and it is curious to find to what extent they are ignored by him.

===Editions===
The first edition of &quot;The Tenures&quot; appeared in 1481 or 1482, being one of the earliest books printed in London and the earliest treatise on English law printed anywhere. The second edition was printed about 1483 in London, and the third about 1490 in Rouen. These editions and many others were in the original French. In 1766 (second edition 1779) David Hoüard, a Norman advocate, published the Tenures under the title of &quot;Anciennes Loix des François conservées dans les coutumes angloises&quot;, arguing that they were derived from, and thus the best evidence for, early French customary law. There have also been many editions in English. In 1628, Edward Coke published &quot;The First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England. Or, a Commentary upon Littleton, Not the Name of a Lawyer Onely, but of the Law Itselfe&quot;, commonly called &quot;Coke Up on Littleton.&quot; There have been about 25 editions of Coke upon Littleton and about 90 editions of &quot;The Tenures&quot; without the commentary. With or without commentary, &quot;The Tenures&quot; formed an important part of legal education for almost three centuries and a half and is still cited in the courts of England and the United States as an authority on the feudal law of real estate. Eugene Wambaugh wrote a learned introduction to the 1903 edition of &quot;The Tenures&quot; (Washington).

<text>Sir Thomas Littleton, 3rd Baronet, often Thomas de Littleton, (3 April 1647 – 31 December 1709), of North Ockendon, Essex and Stoke St. Milborough, Shropshire, was an English lawyer and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1689 and 1709. He served as Speaker of the House of Commons of England from 1698 to 1700, and as Treasurer of the Navy until his death.
==Biography==
Littleton was the son of Sir Thomas Littleton, 2nd Baronet (died 1681), and his wife and cousin Anne Littleton. He was related to Thomas de Littleton, a 15th-century jurist and legal theorist of the Littleton/Lyttelton family. He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford in 1665 and was admitted at Inner Temple in 1666. In 1671, he was called to the bar. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy on 12 April 1681. On 6 September 1682, he married Anne Baun (died 1714), daughter of Benjamin Baun alias Baron, of Westcote, Gloucestershire.

Littleton was returned as Member of Parliament for Woodstock at the 1689 English general election. He was Speaker of the House of Commons of England from 1698 to 1700. He was appointed Treasurer of the Navy in 1699 and held the post for the rest of his life. At the 1702 English general election he was returned as MP for Castle Rising. At the 1705 English general election he was returned as MP for Chichester. He was returned as MP for Portsmouth at the 1708 British general election.

Upon his death, without issue in 1709 aged 62, the baronetcy expired, but his estate passed to his first cousin Mrs Elizabeth Meynell, the daughter of his uncle Edward Littleton.
Macaulay thus sums up the character of Speaker Littleton and his relations with the Whigs: &quot;He was one of their ablest, most zealous and most steadfast friends; and had been, both in the House of Commons and at the board of treasury, an invaluable second to Montague&quot; (the Earl of Halifax).

<text>HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; is the lead ship of the of aircraft carriers. Capable of carrying 60 aircraft including fixed wing, rotary wing and autonomous vehicles, she is named in honour of the first , a World War I era super-dreadnought, which in turn was named after Queen Elizabeth I. The carrier &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; carries her namesake ship&#x27;s honours, as well as her Tudor rose-adorned crest and motto.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; commenced her sea trials in June 2017, was commissioned on 7 December 2017 and entered service in 2020. Her first seagoing commanding officer was Commodore Jerry Kyd who was appointed in 2014 but did not take command until May 2016, having previously commanded the carriers and .

The ship is designed to operate V/STOL aircraft. The air wing will typically consist of F-35B Lightning II multirole fighters and Merlin helicopters for airborne early warning and anti-submarine warfare. The design emphasises flexibility, with accommodation for 250 Royal Marines and the ability to support them with attack helicopters and large troop transports such as Chinooks. She is based at HMNB Portsmouth.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; will deploy as the central part of a UK Carrier Strike Group with escorts and support ships in order to deliver carrier-enabled power projection.

==Design and construction==
On 25 July 2007 Defence Secretary Des Browne announced the order for two new carriers. At the time of approval the first carrier was expected to enter service in July 2015 and the budget was £4.085 billion for two ships. The financial crisis led to a political decision in December 2008 to slow production, delaying &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; until May 2016. This added £1.56 billion to the cost. By March 2010 the budget was estimated at £5.9 billion and in November 2013 the contract was renegotiated with a budget of £6.2 billion. The in-service date was further extended to 2020 in the Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010.

Construction of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; began in 2009. The assembly took place in the Firth of Forth at Rosyth Dockyard from nine blocks built in six UK shipyards: BAE Systems Surface Ships in Glasgow, Babcock at Appledore, Babcock at Rosyth, A&amp;P Tyne in Hebburn, BAE at Portsmouth and Cammell Laird (flight decks) at Birkenhead. Two of the lower main blocks, together weighing more than 6,000 tonnes and forming part of the base of the ship, were assembled and joined into one piece on 30 June 2011.

On 16 August 2011, the 8,000-tonne Lower Block 03 of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; left BAE Systems Surface Ships&#x27; Govan shipyard in Glasgow on a large ocean-going barge. Travelling around the northern coast of Scotland, the block arrived at Rosyth on the evening of 20 August 2011.

On 28 October 2012, an 11,000-tonne section of the carrier began a lengthy journey around the south coast of England, avoiding bad weather, from the shipbuilding hall at Govan to the Rosyth dockyard; it arrived on 21 November. The forward island was constructed at BAE Portsmouth and attached on 14 March 2013; the aft island was attached in June 2013. The ski jump was added in November 2013, leaving just the lifts and radar to be lifted into place. By September 2013 &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was 80% complete internally.

The carrier is three times the size of the &quot;Invincible&quot;-class, and has the ability to carry approximately three times as many aircraft. Despite this, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; has marginally fewer crew than the &quot;Invincible&quot;-class. The ship has two superstructures, or islands, one for navigation and ship&#x27;s operations and the other for flight control and aerial operations. The islands can take on each other&#x27;s function if one is incapacitated.

===Naming ceremony===
&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was christened at Rosyth on 4 July 2014, by Queen Elizabeth II, who said that the warship &quot;marks a new phase in our naval history&quot;. Instead of smashing the traditional bottle of champagne on the hull, she used a bottle of whisky from the Bowmore distillery on Islay.

The ceremony was attended by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (the Lord High Admiral), Admiral George Zambellas (First Sea Lord), senior naval officers from the United States and France, and by politicians including David Cameron and Gordon Brown (the Prime Minister and his immediate predecessor) and Alex Salmond (the First Minister of Scotland). The official piece of music &quot;HMS Queen Elizabeth March&quot;, composed by WO2 Bandmaster John Morrish, was performed at the naming ceremony by the Band of HM Royal Marines Scotland. This piece of music is a competition-winning march chosen by the Carrier Alliance Group, performed and recorded by the Royal Marines Massed Bands.

The ceremony also featured a fly-past by the Red Arrows and a second comprising Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and British Army helicopters. was berthed adjacent to &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; during the ceremony.

The ship was floated out of dry dock on the morning of 17 July 2014. Fitting out was completed at the end of 2015 and the crew moved aboard in May 2016.

===Sea trials===

Sea trials were planned beginning in March 2017 with delivery expected in May 2017, but technical issues delayed her trials. Prior to her departure from Rosyth, an extensive survey was carried out of the Firth of Forth by and 42 Regiment, Royal Engineers to gather information on the tides, the depth of the river bed, and the height of the three river crossings (Forth Bridge, Forth Road Bridge, and Queensferry Crossing). This was necessary as the most recent data available were 60 years old.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; sailed on 26 June 2017 to undergo sea trials. The first stage of the operation was to move the ship from inside the fitting out basin, via one of the access gates, into the Firth of Forth itself, before taking her under the three Forth bridge crossings. Once this was accomplished, the ship took to the open sea off the east coast of Scotland to undertake the first set of trials, including handling and speed tests. During this period, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was accompanied by a pair of Type 23 frigates, and , acting as escorts. The first aircraft to land on the ship was a Merlin HM.2 helicopter of 820 Naval Air Squadron on 3 July. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; arrived at her first stopover at Invergordon, where the ship was fuelled and provisioned. At this point inspections of the hull were carried out. This opportunity allowed defect rectification to be carried out prior to the ship returning to sea.
On 8 August 2017, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; diverted from her sea trials to rendezvous with the ships engaged in Exercise &#x27;Saxon Warrior&#x27;; this allowed for a photo exercise in company with the American and her Carrier Strike Group (CSG), comprising , , , and HNoMS &quot;Helge Ingstad&quot;.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was scheduled to return to Rosyth at the end of July for rectification work based on the results of the ship&#x27;s first sea trials, before putting to sea for a second time to undergo a series of mission system tests, prior to being handed over to the Royal Navy. This plan was abandoned and she instead steered for her home port, Portsmouth.
&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; arrived at HMNB Portsmouth for the first time on 16 August 2017 and berthed at the newly renamed Princess Royal Jetty (formerly Middle Slip Jetty).

On 30 October 2017, the ship departed Portsmouth for the first time for the second phase of her sea trials off the south and south-west coasts of England. For part of this second period of sea trials, she was accompanied by the Type 45 destroyer . &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; returned to Portsmouth on 21 November 2017 to prepare for her official commissioning ceremony, which was held on 7 December 2017. Following the ship&#x27;s commissioning, she underwent a period of defect correction in Portsmouth; one instance was a leak through a seal in one of the propeller shafts, which the Royal Navy stated was not serious enough to keep &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; from her planned programme.

==Operational history==
On 2 February 2018, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; sailed from Portsmouth for a second time, for a six-week deployment to undergo the first phases of operational training; initially, the ship was scheduled to head into the Western Approaches to undertake her initial Operational Sea Training (OST) programme. Once complete, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was then taken into the North Atlantic for both heavy weather testing and operations to begin helicopter certification, including with Merlin Mk2 and Mk3 and Chinook helicopters. During this deployment, the ship made her first overseas port visit, stopping over in Gibraltar from 9 to 12 February. During this, the ship also began initial amphibious assault trials, with Royal Marines from 42 Commando embarked to simulate an air assault scenario. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was also scheduled to undergo a first replenishment at sea from ; although the actual replenishment had to be abandoned due to bad weather, the rendezvous allowed both ships the opportunity to simulate the scenario in detail. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; returned to Portsmouth on 27 February 2018, berthing at Princess Royal Jetty. On 2 March 2018 in Portsmouth Harbour, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; successfully tested her port side Marine Evacuation System (MES), a series of bright orange inflatable escape chutes and rafts.

&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; departed Portsmouth for a third time on 10 June 2018, heading to the coasts of Cornwall for a second phase of helicopter flight trials. After the trials were completed, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; headed for home and performed her first replenishment at sea (RAS) refuelling operation with &quot;Tidespring&quot; on 21 June 2018 in the English Channel, then returned to Portsmouth on 23 June 2018.
On return from the initial OST and helicopter certification work, further work was undertaken to prepare the ship for the operation of fixed-wing aircraft, in conjunction with regular maintenance and installation of her final weapons fit.
===Westlant 18===
&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;″s first significant deployment took place during autumn 2018, when the ship travelled across the Atlantic to begin flying trials with her fixed-wing aircraft. Although the programme covered a range of areas, including the continued workup of the Commander UK Carrier Strike Group and his staff, embarked for a deployment for the first time, and small-scale exercises to test the ship&#x27;s ability to land troops in the secondary amphibious role, the primary purpose was the first phase of fixed-wing flying trials involving the F-35B over two separate periods of approximately 3–4 weeks each starting in mid-September, utilising a pair of the instrumented development aircraft from VX-23, the US Navy&#x27;s air testing unit at NAS Patuxent River. The testing programme saw the first launch of an F-35 from a ski-jump at sea (the F-35B has operated from the US Navy&#x27;s assault ships, but these are not fitted with ski-jumps), and the first demonstration of the shipborne rolling vertical landing technique.

In addition to the F-35 trials, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; also began qualifications for types of aircraft operated by the US armed forces, including the V-22 Osprey. As part of the deployment, the ship made her first overseas port visit to New York City in October, in between layovers at Naval Station Norfolk, some operations in the Caribbean possible, to test the ship&#x27;s hot weather performance, as well as being on hand if needed for any disaster relief operations during the hurricane season. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was scheduled to return to the UK in December.
On 18 August 2018, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; sailed from Portsmouth on what was termed as &quot;Westlant 18&quot;, carrying three Merlin Mk2 helicopters of 820 NAS. Later, on 20 August 2018, three additional Merlin Mk4 helicopters from 845 NAS were embarked to the ship. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was then met by to form a carrier group. On 3 September 2018, &quot;Monmouth&quot;″s Wildcat HMA2 helicopter became the first of its type to land aboard &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. On 5 September 2018, the two ships arrived at Naval Station Mayport in north-east Florida, for a period of replenishment. The ships remained in Florida for eight days before departing for the planned trip northwards to US Naval Station Norfolk.

During the transit north, she was to undertake an amphibious assault exercise off the coast of South Carolina using its Merlin Mk4 helicopters and Royal Marines of 42 Commando. However, due to the effects of Hurricane Florence, this exercise was cancelled and the group instead sailed south; &quot;Monmouth&quot; headed to waters off The Bahamas, which acted as a windbreak, while &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; skirted around the south of the hurricane zone. The group eventually arrived at Norfolk on 17 September. During the period alongside at Norfolk, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; embarked a further 200 personnel of the F-35B Integrated Test Force, to undertake the testing and analysis of the two F-35B aircraft to be used during the initial set of flying trials.

On 25 September 2018, two US-owned F-35B test aircraft, based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, flew out to meet &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; off the New Jersey coast. After refuelling, Commander Gray then achieved the first F-35B take off from &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; using the ski-jump ramp. During the initial F-35B trials, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; also began trials for the UK Carrier Group staff when the ship, along with &quot;Monmouth&quot;, formed a task group with the US Navy destroyer and , a fast combat support ship, which performed RAS with &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and &quot;Monmouth&quot; on 1 October 2018. During October, the first instances of cross-decking took place when a US Navy MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter, and a US Marine Corps tiltrotor MV-22B Osprey landed on board. The first shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) by an F-35 was undertaken on 14 October – this was also the first operational demonstration of the technique on a ship at sea, and is planned as the primary method of recovering fixed-wing aircraft aboard the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class.

On 19 October 2018, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; arrived in New York City for a planned seven day visit. Kyd remarked &quot;we are the biggest carrier to go in there for about 50 years&quot;, as the U.S. Navy&#x27;s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are forbidden from making a port of call in New York City. She dropped anchor near Ellis and Liberty Islands in Upper New York Bay. During the ship&#x27;s stopover, she played host to a forum hosted by Gavin Williamson, the UK Secretary of State for Defence, on the future of cyber security, as well as an international trade day hosted by Liam Fox, the Secretary of State for International Trade. On 19 November 2018, another milestone was met with a F-35B test pilot landing on the ship facing the stern instead of the bow.

===Post-Westlant 18===
Following the ship&#x27;s return from Westlant 18, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; began a maintenance period in early 2019 that saw the installation of the remainder of the ship&#x27;s self-defence armament, with two Phalanx CIWS mounts fitted. This was followed by the ship&#x27;s return to Rosyth to allow it to be dry-docked for its first scheduled hull inspection. The remaining Phalanx CIWS and four DS30M mounts will be fitted during 2020.

After further fixed-wing aircraft trials in 2019, using British F-35 aircraft over UK waters, followed then by operational testing. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; was expected to reach initial operational capability by 2020, now with Commodore Stephen Moorhouse in command. Gavin Williamson announced that the ship&#x27;s first deployment will be to the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Pacific region, the last to counter China&#x27;s territorial claims in the South China Sea.

On 10 January 2019, &quot;Jane&#x27;s Defence Weekly&quot; reported that F-35 aircraft of the United Kingdom would join the F-35Bs of the US Marine Corps in embarking &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; for the ship&#x27;s first operational cruise in 2021.

===Westlant 19===
&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; departed for her second WESTLANT cruise on 30 August 2019. This deployment was to undertake the second stage of fixed-wing flight testing, and would see the F-35B employed as a full part of the ship&#x27;s air group, with 617 Squadron due to embark for the first time to operate alongside 17 Squadron, the type&#x27;s evaluation unit. The deployment will also see the first full up operation of the UK Carrier Strike Group, with &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; to be accompanied by and HMS &quot;Dragon&quot; supported by . On 13 October 2019, F-35Bs from 17 Squadron landed on HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time.

HMS Queen Elizabeth arrived home in Portsmouth on 4 December 2019. On 16 December 2019, the first-ever F-35B launch in British territorial waters took place, when an aircraft of that model took off from the flight deck of HMS Queen Elizabeth in Portsmouth Harbour. The aircraft, registration ZM148 (BK14) safely returned to its base at RAF Marham on the same day. ZM148 (BK14) had developed a fault during Westlant19 and was retained aboard Queen Elizabeth for repair.

===Post-Westlant 19===
HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; departed Portsmouth in January 2020 for flight trials in UK waters for the first time and was joined by British-owned F-35B Lightning aircraft from RAF No. 207 Squadron. In June 2020, F-35Bs from 617 Squadron landed on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; for Operational Sea Training to prepare for Initial Operating Capability (Maritime) by the end of 2020.

The summer 2020 period was spent in harbour undergoing preparation work for September, when the ship took part in a major carrier group exercise that was run as part of Exercise Joint Warrior, with the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; accompanied not just by ships of the Royal Navy, but also an escort from both the US and Dutch navies, as well as two squadrons of F-35Bs- one each from both the RAF and USMC. Following the conclusion of &quot;Joint Warrior&quot;, the ship returned to port to have the remainder of its equipment fitted, while the joint UK/US air group undertook a further exercise from RAF Marham.

Initial Operating Capability was announced on 4 January 2021, and on 27 January, the ship assumed the role of Fleet Flagship of the Royal Navy, taking over from amphibious transport dock .

===Carrier Strike Group 21===

Between 7 and 21 May, the Carrier Strike Group took part in Exercise Strike Warrior, as part of Exercise Joint Warrior 21-1 Once the carrier strike group finished Exercise Strike Warrior, it made its way back to HMNB Portsmouth for final preparations, before finally departing on 23 or 24 May. On 21 May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson toured the ship. Queen Elizabeth II visited the ship on 22 May. Initially the group took part in joint exercises with NATO partners in the Eastern Atlantic, before entering the Mediterranean Sea, where it more conducted exercises with Mediterranean NATO allies, including with the French carrier &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot;, in the dual-carrier exercise named Exercise Gallic Strike before entering port at Souda Bay for a logistic stop. A Type 45 destroyer, HMS &quot;Defender&quot; and HNLMS &quot;Evertsen&quot; detached from the group to enter the Black Sea – a visit that was already planned prior to the heightened Russian activity in the region. On 7 July 2021, the group transited the Suez Canal to enter the Indian Ocean where they conducted joint exercises with the Indian Navy before proceeding past Singapore, without stopping, to enter the disputed South China Sea region to conduct freedom of navigation exercises in the area with the US Navy. Subsequently, the group will pay a visit to South Korea and then conduct exercises with the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and United States Navy around the islands of Japan.

On 18 June 2021, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; began combat operations against ISIS, supporting Operation Inherent Resolve. F-35B aircraft from 617 Squadron, RAF and US Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 (VMFA-211) launched strikes from &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; to attack ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria.

An outbreak of COVID-19 was reported on &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and her escort ships on 14 July 2021. The British Defence Secretary stated that the outbreak was being managed and that all personnel in the Carrier Strike Group had been vaccinated against COVID-19. Mitigation measures were also in place aboard the warships including the use of masks, social distancing and a &quot;Track and Trace system&quot; to monitor personnel movement. The deployment proceeded as planned to Japan.

On 26 July 2021, &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and her escort ships conducted a passage exercise with three ships from the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) in the South China Sea. This is the first time that a Royal Navy Carrier Strike Group has conducted military exercises with the RSN. On 16 November 2021, one of the carrier&#x27;s F-35B fighters, ZM152 from 617 Squadron, crashed during operations in the Mediterranean. The pilot was able to eject safely.

===Carrier Strike Deployment 23===
In September 2023, the carrier embarked 8 F-35B fighters from 617 Squadron, 5 Merlin helicopters from 820 Squadron and 3 Wildcat helicopters from 847 Squadron for its &quot;Operation FIREDRAKE&quot; deployment in northern European waters. Of five Merlins deployed, two were in the AEW configuration. The carrier was escorted by , and RFA Tideforce.
On 4 September 2024, a member of Royal Navy personnel died after a Merlin Mk. 4 helicopter ditched in the English Channel near Dorset while conducting night flying exercises with HMS Queen Elizabeth. The two other crew onboard were taken to hospital.

==Aircraft==
The two ships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class are each expected to be capable of carrying over forty aircraft, with a normal maximum load of thirty-six F-35s and four helicopters, but with a theoretical surge capacity of up to 72 aircraft. The 2010 SDSR anticipated the routine peacetime deployment of twelve F-35Bs, but a typical warload will be 24 F-35Bs and some helicopters. These could be a &quot;Maritime Force Protection&quot; package of nine anti-submarine Merlin HM2 and five Merlin Crowsnest for airborne early warning; alternatively a littoral manoeuvre package could include a mix of Royal Navy Commando Helicopter Force Merlin HC4, Wildcat AH1, RAF Chinooks, and Army Air Corps Apaches. In 2022, it was reported that initially five Merlins will be equipped with Crowsnest, and three of these will normally be assigned to the &quot;high readiness&quot; aircraft carrier.

The hangars are designed for CH-47 Chinook operations without blade folding and for the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, whilst the aircraft lifts can accommodate two Chinooks with unfolded blades.

==Passenger transfer boats==

The two ships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class can each carry up to three passenger transfer boats (PTBs) made by Blyth-based company Alnmaritec. Each PTB carries 36 passengers and two crew to operate the vessel. The boat is 13.1 m long and davit-launched. To enable the craft to fit into the docking area the navigation and radar masts are fitted with Linak actuators so that they can be lowered automatically from the command console. The enclosed cabin is heated and there is a set of heads forward.

* The first boat is named &quot;Swordfish&quot;, after the World War II-era Fairey Swordfish torpedo bomber.
* The second PTB is named &quot;Buccaneer&quot; after the Blackburn Buccaneer maritime strike aircraft.
* The third is named &quot;Sea Vixen,&quot; after the de Havilland Sea Vixen naval fighter.
* The fourth is named &quot;Sea Harrier&quot;, after the V/STOL British Aerospace Sea Harrier.

==Weapons systems==
Defensive weapons include the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System for anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence, and 30mm Automated Small Calibre Guns (fitted for but not with, and not carried as of 2021.) and initially Miniguns for use against fast attack craft. In 2023, the Minigun was retired from Royal Navy service and replaced by Browning .50 caliber heavy machine guns. Air defence is provided by the Type 45 destroyers, while frigates provide anti-submarine and other general escort capabilities.

===Munitions handling===
Incorporated into the first two blocks is a sophisticated handling and deployment system for air weapons known as the Highly Mechanised Weapon Handling System (HMWHS), with the aim of achieving a sortie generation rate which is about six times faster than any previous Royal Navy aircraft carrier. The system requires only 50 people and could be operated with as few as 12 in an emergency; it is estimated that 160 would be needed to produce the same efficiency with conventional equipment. The system moves munitions on pallets by means of remotely controlled electric vehicles and lifts.

<text>In Greek mythology, Ilus (; ) is the name of several mythological characters associated directly or indirectly with Troy:
* Ilus, the son of Dardanus, and the legendary founder of Dardania.
*Ilus, the son of Tros, and the legendary founder of Troy.
* Ilus, son of Mermerus, and grandson of Jason and Medea. This Ilus lived at Ephyra, between Elis and Olympia. In a tale recounted in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, he played host to Odysseus, but when Odysseus requested from Ilus poison for his arrows, he declined, from fear of divine vengeance.
* Ilus, an ally of Turnus, the man who opposed Aeneas in Italy.

<doc id="631241" wikidata="Q1565207" url="?curid=631241" title="HMS Prince of Wales (R09)">
<text>HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; (R09) is the second and the Fleet Flagship of the Royal Navy. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; is not fitted with catapults and arrestor wires, and is instead designed to operate STOVL aircraft; the ship is currently planned to carry up to 48 F-35B Lightning II stealth multirole fighters and Merlin helicopters for airborne early warning and anti-submarine warfare, although in surge conditions the class is capable of supporting 70+ F-35B. The design emphasises flexibility, with accommodation for 250 Royal Marines and the ability to support them with attack helicopters and troop transports up to and larger than Chinook size.

The completed &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; began sea trials in September 2019 and first arrived at her new home base of HMNB Portsmouth in November 2019. The ship was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy at a ceremony in Portsmouth on 10 December 2019. The ship&#x27;s commissioning date marked the 78th anniversary of the sinking of her predecessor, a World War II era battleship which was lost in action along with in 1941. She is the eighth Royal Navy ship to have the name . Construction of the ship began in 2011 at Rosyth Dockyard and ended with launch on 21 December 2017. She was handed over to the Royal Navy in 2019. 

When on operations, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; will form a central part of a UK Carrier Strike Group, comprising escorts and support ships, with the aim to facilitate carrier-enabled power projection.

==Design and construction==

Much like her sister ship &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, the original 2008 design of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; envisaged flying F-35B Lightning II Short Take-Off and Vertical Landing (STOVL) jets from a ski-jump ramp. However, in May 2010, the government published its long-awaited Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), which stated that &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; would be converted to a Catapult Assisted Take-Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) configuration, operating the F-35C. An 18-month study commenced into the conversion but ultimately found that it would cause severe cost implications and delays. In May 2012, the government announced it would be reversing its decision to convert &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and that the ship would be built to its original STOVL design.

The SDSR also stipulated that the UK only required one aircraft carrier, however penalty clauses in the contract meant that cancelling &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; would be more expensive than building her. Instead, the government planned to construct &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and then either place her into extended readiness or have her sold to an ally. Contrary to this, in 2012, the Royal Navy published its annual yearbook, titled &quot;A Global Force 2012/13&quot;, which stated that both carriers are &quot;likely to be commissioned and may even be capable of operating together&quot;.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was assembled at Rosyth from 52 blocks built by six shipyards around the UK. Construction began on 26 May 2011 with the first steel being cut at Govan shipyard by Defence Secretary Liam Fox. In September 2014, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; reached a final assembly phase when hull blocks LB02 and LB03 were floated into 1 Dock of Rosyth dockyard, Scotland.

During the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; would be brought into active service, rather than sold off or mothballed. This was later confirmed in the government&#x27;s 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review.
In April 2016, the ship was said to be around 80% structurally complete. On 1 September 2017 HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ most senior officer, Captain Ian Groom, confirmed that the carrier was now essential to fulfilling the Royal Navy&#x27;s &#x27;full carrier strike capability.&#x27;

===Sea trials===
&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was formally named on 8 September 2017 at Rosyth dockyard by Queen Camilla (then the Duchess of Rothesay). On 21 December 2017, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was floated out of Rosyth drydock #1 for the first time and manoeuvred to a nearby jetty for fitting-out and further systems integration. A Merlin Mk2 helicopter landed and took off six times on her flight deck on 23 September 2019.

The &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was due to commence sea trials in 2019 with a view to being commissioned in late 2019. As such, the ship left the fitting out basin at Rosyth for the first time on 20 September 2019; initially she remained anchored in the Firth of Forth, undertaking initial engine and system tests, and waiting for the tide to allow her to pass under the bridges crossing the firth. HMS Prince of Wales sailed under the Firth of Forth bridges on 22 September 2019 and began sea trials.

On 16 November 2019, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; arrived at her home base of Portsmouth for the first time, berthing at Princess Royal Jetty. The ship was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy at a ceremony in Portsmouth on 10 December 2019. She is expected to be fully ready for front-line duties around the globe from 2023.

On 28 February 2020, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; arrived in her affiliated city of Liverpool for the first time on a week-long visit.

In May 2020, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; experienced flooding which the Royal Navy described as &quot;minor&quot;. This was followed by more significant flooding from the fire control system in October 2020 which caused damage to her electrical cabling. She was confined to docks where she remained for almost eight months whilst repairs were made. Her long-planned deployment to the United States to undertake her first F-35B trials was cancelled. During 2020 &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was at sea just 30 days, compared to 115 days for &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. Following repair &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; departed Portsmouth Naval Base to resume sea trials on 30 April 2021. In October 2021, the Royal Navy declared the ship as fully operational.

=== Aircraft ===

The two ships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class are each expected to be capable of carrying forty aircraft, a maximum of 36 Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II stealth multirole fighters and four AgustaWestland Merlin helicopters. The 2010 SDSR anticipated the routine deployment of twelve F-35Bs, but a typical warload will be 24 F-35Bs and some helicopters. These could be a Maritime Force Protection package of nine anti-submarine Merlin HM2 and five Merlin Crowsnest for airborne early warning; alternatively a &quot;littoral manoeuvre&quot; package could potentially include a mix of Royal Navy Commando Helicopter Force Merlin HC4, AgustaWestland Wildcat AH1, RAF Boeing Chinook transports, and Army Air Corps AgustaWestland Apache AH.1 attack helicopters. In 2022, it was reported that initially five Merlins will be equipped with Crowsnest, and that three of these will normally be assigned to the &quot;high readiness&quot; aircraft carrier. six landing spots are planned, but the deck could be marked out for the operation of ten medium helicopters at once, allowing the lift of a company of 250 troops. The hangars are designed for CH-47 Chinook operations without blade folding and for the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor, whilst the aircraft lifts can accommodate two Chinooks with unfolded blades.

===Passenger/crew transfer boats===

The two ships of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; class were to each carry four PTBs made by Blyth-based company Alnmaritec. Each long PTB carries 36 passengers and two crew to operate the vessel and is davit-launched. To enable the craft to fit into the docking area the navigation and radar masts are fitted with Linak actuators so that they can be lowered automatically from the command console. The enclosed cabin is heated and there is a set of heads forward. 

Subsequently, it was reported that &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; would carry three of the new &quot;Sea&quot;-class work boats being procured for various tasks in the Royal Navy. 

===Weapons systems===
Defensive weapons include the Phalanx Close-In Weapons System for anti-aircraft and anti-missile defence and initially Miniguns for use against fast attack craft. In 2023, the Minigun was retired from Royal Navy service and replaced by Browning .50 caliber heavy machine guns. The 30mm Automated Small Calibre Guns are fitted for but not with, and not carried as of 2021.

===Replica bell from predecessor===

In spring 2019, Merseyside shipbuilder Cammell Laird, who built the ship&#x27;s predecessor, the &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleship , and also built sections for both the current ship and , was commissioned to make a replica of the predecessor&#x27;s bell for the current ship. The original, raised in 2002 and currently residing at the National Museum of the Royal Navy location at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, was surveyed as part of the process.

Cammell Laird were able to contact Utley Offshore in St Helens, the foundry that made the original bell still had the original pattern based on the 1908 Admiralty design. Compared to the bronze or bell metal that is used in most modern ship bells, specially sourced nickel silver was used for authenticity. The engraving was done by Shawcross in Birkenhead, while Cammell Laird shipwrights constructed the hardwood base. Cammell Laird COO Tony Graham presented the finished replica to commanding officer Captain Darren Houston during the ship&#x27;s week-long visit to Liverpool in March 2020.

==Name==

The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class carrier is the eighth , named after the title traditionally granted to the heir apparent of the British monarch. The name was announced at the same time as that of her sister ship .

The decommissioning of under the SDSR in 2010 led to an unsuccessful campaign for one of the new aircraft carriers to receive that name.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was formally named on 8 September 2017 at Rosyth Dockyard on the Firth of Forth at Rosyth, Fife, Scotland by the then-Duchess of Rothesay, now Queen Camilla.
== Operational history ==

In May 2020, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; experienced flooding which the Royal Navy described as &quot;minor&quot;. This was followed by more significant flooding in October 2020 which caused damage to her electrical cabling. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; departed Portsmouth Naval Base on sea trials on 30 April 2021. In October 2021, the Royal Navy declared the ship as fully operational.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; participated in an international exercise off the coast of Scotland in October 2021. This involved joint operations with her sister ship HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth.&quot;

=== NATO command ship ===
On 1 January 2022, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; took over the role of command ship for NATO&#x27;s maritime high readiness force from the French Navy. The ship was intended to spend the next twelve months supporting NATO exercises in the Arctic, Baltic and Mediterranean. Her first exercise in this role was Cold Response 22, a Norwegian-led exercise which was designed to test her crew in this role.

=== 2022 starboard propeller shaft external coupling malfunction ===

On 27 August 2022 &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; departed HMNB Portsmouth to undertake training exercises with the US Navy, the Royal Canadian Navy, and United States Marine Corps, and to host the Atlantic Future Forum trade and economic conference in New York. On 29 August after suffering mechanical problems in the UK&#x27;s South Coast Exercise area, the ship proceeded to anchor in the Solent off the Isle of Wight. It was reported that an external coupling that connects the outer propeller shaft to the drive shaft from the propulsion motors had failed. Rear Admiral Steve Moorhouse, Director of Force Generation, confirmed &quot;significant damage to the shaft and the propeller and some superficial damage to the rudder. There is no damage to the rest of the ship&quot;. She arrived in Rosyth for repairs on 12 October 2022, and was originally expected to return to Portsmouth in spring 2023 following completion of repair work. The ship returned to sea for trials after completing repairs on 21 July 2023.

=== 2023 aircraft and UAV trials ===

In September 2023, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; began a series of trials with different UAV systems intended for resupply. Once in the Channel the ship’s company will conduct trials with UK-firm W Autonomous Systems to assess the feasibility of drones delivering supplies to Royal Navy vessels at sea – initially flying in up to 100kg of stores. W Autonomous WAS platform is a twin-engine light alloy twin boom aircraft capable of carrying a payload of 100kg up to 1000km. Later in the year, the carrier was expected to operate in US waters for broader trials with platforms including the MV-22B Osprey and Mojave UAV.

On 15 November a General Atomics Mojave unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) took off from and then landed back on board &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, with the aircraft carrier situated off the east coast of the United States. This marked a point in time where the Mojave Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) drone is the largest uncrewed vehicle to have flown from a non-US Navy carrier. Noted for its short take-off and landing (STOL) capability, the UAV&#x27;s take-off was conducted at an angle across the flight deck and did not utilise the main ramp. It is expected that the results of these trials will interest many international partners.

=== Exercise Steadfast Defender 2024 ===
On 12 February 2024, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; sailed for Norway to participate in Exercise Steadfast Defender replacing &quot;HMS Queen Elizabeth&quot; which was suffering from an issue with a propeller shaft coupling preventing her from deploying. She embarked F-35Bs from 617 Squadron and AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat helicopters from 847 Naval Air Squadron. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; returned to HMNB Portsmouth on 26 March.

<text>GRIMMS were an English pop rock, comedy, and poetry group, originally formed as a merger of The Scaffold with two members of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and the Liverpool Scene for two concerts in 1971 at the suggestion of John Gorman.

The band&#x27;s name is an acronym, formed from the initial letters of each original member&#x27;s surname:
*Gorman, John (The Scaffold) – vocals
*Roberts, Andy (Liverpool Scene and The Scaffold) – vocals, guitar
*Innes, Neil (Bonzo Dog Band) – vocals, keyboards, guitar
*McGear, Mike (The Scaffold) – vocals, percussion
*McGough, Roger (The Scaffold) – vocals, spoken poetry
*Stanshall, Vivian (Bonzo Dog Band) – vocals, percussion, brass instruments.

==History==

During the late 1960s, The Scaffold and The Bonzo Dog Band had each already achieved a respectable measure of success independently of each other in the UK, through their regular appearances on television and radio and their respective chart successes in 1968 with &#x27;Lily The Pink&#x27; and &#x27;The Urban Spaceman&#x27;.

By 1970, while The Scaffold still remained active, The Bonzo Dog Band were technically no longer a going concern. Some members of the Bonzos would however briefly reform in 1971 to record &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Up and Be Friendly&quot; to fulfill their recording contract, and as a result Neil Innes and Vivian Stanshall assembled a band to tour the UK during 1971 and 72. This group, billed variously as &#x27;Freaks&#x27; or &#x27;Bonzo Dog Freaks&#x27; occasionally featured Andy Roberts, who was also a close long-time associate of The Scaffold. During this period, Innes and Stanshall also guested on The Scaffold&#x27;s &#x27;Do The Albert&#x27; single and some of their more obscure musical ventures such as the theme song to the 1972 movie &#x27;Burke And Hare&#x27;. A more formal grouping of the talents involved seemingly became inevitable.

Neil Innes said about the eventual formation of GRIMMS: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what attracted the Scaffold to the Bonzos; we were incredibly anarchic, which was probably something shared by the Scaffold as well. Hence GRIMMS, this leap in the dark.&quot;

For GRIMMS&#x27; initial performances, the six founder members were augmented by various friends and guest musicians - at the second appearance, for example, Keith Moon played drums (Moon had also played with &#x27;Freaks&#x27;, most notably on their BBC Radio One session in March 1971). However, once GRIMMS was more formally organised by 1972, regular personnel were quickly added, including:
* Adrian Henri (Liverpool Scene) – spoken vocals/poetry
* Brian Patten – spoken vocals/poetry
* Michael Giles (King Crimson) – drums
* Dave Richards (Plainsong) – bass, vocals
* John Megginson – bass, keyboards.

These eleven musicians, poets and performers formed the &quot;real&quot; initial version of GRIMMS, despite the acronym which only included the names of six of them. Others who appeared live and on record with the band throughout its existence included (amongst many others):
* George Bruno &#x27;Zoot&#x27; Money – (Zoot Money&#x27;s Big Roll Band and Dantalian&#x27;s Chariot) – keyboards, vocals, acoustic guitar
* Peter &quot;Ollie&quot; Halsall (Timebox and Patto) – guitars, vocals
* Gerry Conway (Cat Stevens band and Steeleye Span) – drums
* Jon Hiseman (Colosseum) – drums
* John Halsey (Timebox and Patto) – drums
* Timmy Donald (incorrectly credited as Timmy Donnell on recordings) – drums
* Mike Kellie – drums
* Gasper Lawal – drums, percussion, chorus vocals
* Shamsi Sarumi – drums, percussion, chorus vocals
* Kate Robbins – backing vocals

All the band members were paid the same wage on the road, and members who weren&#x27;t performing in a show would sit with the audience.

Roberts, Richards and Stanshall do not appear on the band&#x27;s first Island Records LP, &quot;Grimms&quot;, which was a live recording compiled from a run of UK shows in 1972. Roberts and Richards were committed to touring with the band Plainsong in 1972 and so missed the performances during which the first album was recorded. The notoriously mercurial Stanshall, meanwhile, had essentially already left the group before the LP was recorded, but although he consequently never appeared on any of the band&#x27;s albums, the line-up remained flexible enough to allow him to occasionally return for guest spots at concerts afterwards. Henri, Giles and Money all left after the live album was released in early 1973, to be replaced by Halsall and Conway.

During this busy period McGough, McGear, Gorman and Roberts also remained a going concern on their own terms as The Scaffold, releasing the album &quot;Fresh Liver&quot;, also on Island Records. Ostensibly a Scaffold album, the lines between the two bands became increasingly blurred as Innes, Halsall, Megginson, Money and Conway all made significant musical contributions to the LP. Innes himself recorded and released his own solo debut &quot;How Sweet To Be An Idiot&quot; in the same year backed by Roberts, Halsall, Richards and Conway. McGough and Patten, meanwhile, also continued their ongoing parallel careers as published poets. As for GRIMMS itself, although the band&#x27;s line-up was in a constant state of flux, it nevertheless retained a core membership of about 10 players right through to the end of 1973.

GRIMMS&#x27; own second LP of 1973, the studio album &quot;Rockin&#x27; Duck&quot;, received generally favourable press, but shortly after its release tensions among the band&#x27;s leaders reached breaking point, preventing the group from capitalising on the good reviews. During the tour behind the album in late 1973, a violent outburst from Patten towards McGear on the band&#x27;s tour bus in Manchester led to McGear leaving the group. During this tour Neil Innes was absent for certain dates and John Hiseman also sat in on drums to cover for the outgoing Conway, and the absence of Innes and presence of Hiseman can be heard on a BBC Radio 1 &quot;In Concert&quot; broadcast from this period. By the end of the year Halsall had also left GRIMMS (and would soon go on to join Hiseman&#x27;s new group Tempest).

During 1974, GRIMMS suspended operations entirely when The Scaffold, at McGear&#x27;s instigation, reunited for a major tour in support of surprise hit single &quot;Liverpool Lou&quot;, and most of the remaining GRIMMS – with the notable exception of Patten – accompanied them. The Scaffold then elected to record another, final album, &quot;Sold Out&quot;, and those commitments stymied any GRIMMS activity until the following year.

GRIMMS eventually reconvened early in 1975 to tour and to film a television special entitled &quot;GRIMMS on Women&quot; shown as part of the BBC series &quot;The Camera and the Song&quot;. Gorman, Innes, McGough, Roberts, Richards and Megginson were rejoined in this endeavour by Patten and a returning Zoot Money, and new arrival &#x27;Admiral&#x27; John Halsey (formerly of Patto and currently of Innes&#x27; backing band Fatso, and later to reunite with Innes and Ollie Halsall in The Rutles) entered the scene. Halsey had a highly developed sense of comedic timing honed during his days in Patto which brought much to GRIMMS&#x27; live performances of the period. It was also around this time that GRIMMS released a book of poetry, lyrics, prose and art based loosely around their exploits on tour entitled &#x27;Clowns on the Road&#x27;.

By the time it came to record their third and what turned out to be final album &quot;Sleepers&quot; in 1976, Halsey was unavailable and Patten and Money had both left again (although Money later contributed vocals to one track). Drummer Timmy Donald (whose name was misspelled as Donnell in the original LP credits) had joined them for the album sessions, which left the final version of GRIMMS with &#x27;only&#x27; seven members (Gorman, Roberts, Innes, McGough, Megginson, Richards and Donald). The band set out to make the album a more overtly musical affair than before and felt they had succeeded by the end of recording, but once the album was released, GRIMMS finally fizzled out as the members went their separate ways and somehow never regrouped again. Although &quot;Sleepers&quot; proved to be the band&#x27;s swansong, in the liner notes of the expanded CD reissue of the album the key members are reported as considering it their best and most cohesive recorded statement.

<doc id="631251" wikidata="Q3476538" url="?curid=631251" title="Scum (film)">
<text>Scum is a 1979 British prison drama film directed by Alan Clarke and starring Ray Winstone, Mick Ford, Julian Firth and John Blundell. The film portrays the brutality of life inside a British borstal. The script was originally filmed as a television play for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; series in 1977. However, owing to the violence depicted, it was withdrawn from broadcast. Two years later, director Alan Clarke and scriptwriter Roy Minton remade it as a film, first shown on Channel 4 in 1983. By this time the borstal system had been reformed. The original TV version was eventually allowed to be aired eight years later in 1991.

The film tells the story of a young offender named Carlin as he arrives at the institution and his rise through violence and self-protection to the top of the inmates&#x27; pecking order, purely as a tool to survive. Beyond Carlin&#x27;s individual storyline, the film also serves as an indictment of the borstal system&#x27;s flaws, with no attempt at rehabilitation. The warders and convicts alike are brutalised by the system. The film&#x27;s controversy arose over its graphic depiction of racism, extreme violence, rape, suicide, many fights and very strong language.

== Plot ==
Three young men arrive at a borstal by prison van: Carlin, who has taken the blame for his brother&#x27;s theft of scrap metal; Angel for stealing a car; and Davis for escaping from an open institution. Each is allocated a room; Angel and Davis get private rooms while Carlin is sent to a dormitory.

Carlin, having been transferred for assaulting a warden, wants to keep a low profile. He meets and befriends Archer, an eccentric and intellectual inmate serving two years for workplace fraud who is intent upon peacefully inconveniencing the staff as much as possible. Archer tells Carlin how his reputation is already known: Banks, the current &quot;Daddy&quot; (the inmate who controls the wing), is seeking Carlin for a fight to maintain his dominance over the wing. Banks&#x27; status appears to have been achieved by petty bullying and intimidation with the aid of his henchmen Richards and Eckersley and the passive assent of the staff.

Carlin struggles to settle into the dormitory and, after witnessing the timid and vulnerable Davis hazed and attacked by Banks, is himself viciously beaten and headbutted by Banks in an unprovoked attack. Angel is brutally beaten up by Banks and Richards in his room. Davis is framed for theft of a radio by Eckersley and placed on report. Soon sentenced to arrest, the three newcomers find themselves in solitary confinement. Realising there is no hope of being allowed to serve his term as a borstal &quot;trainee&quot; in peace, Carlin exacts revenge and establishes dominance. Walking through the association (rec) room he picks up two snooker balls and puts them in a sock. Using this improvised cosh on Richards, Carlin orders Eckersley to desist from informing, then goes to find Banks. Surprising him in a washroom he gives Banks a severe beating and then tells him who the &quot;Daddy&quot; of the wing now is: one who will &#x27;kill him&#x27; if Banks ever interferes with his or his friends&#x27; wellbeing. This ambush required cooperation and information from other inmates, showing how Carlin has soon won both respect and amity.

Several days later, Carlin is challenged by an adjacent wing&#x27;s Daddy whom he viciously beats but allows to continue to manage his wing under Carlin&#x27;s overall control. Things improve for the inmates under Carlin, with victimisation of younger, weaker prisoners prevented, along with racially-motivated violence. He keeps to the same seat at table in the dining hall, to where information and requests are directed, and with his associates such as Archer and Meakin – a contrast to Banks and his bullies. Carlin&#x27;s status is recognised by the warders: he requests and gets a single cell in return for agreeing to be a responsible &quot;natural leader&quot; to the housemaster Mr. Goodyear.

Meanwhile, Meakin&#x27;s friend Toyne, learns through a letter from his in-laws that his wife has died. He becomes severely depressed, his despair being noticed by the warders who scold him for &quot;moping&quot;. Toyne slashes the arteries in his arms. He is transferred to an adult prison where, Meakin later learns, he died after a second suicide attempt. Carlin advises him to be careful to avoid Eckersley and his cronies but while working alone in a greenhouse, Davis is gang-raped by three youths who had requested a smoking break after seeing him there. Their supervising warder Sands sees what happens but reacts with a grin and then ignores the dishevelled state of the semi-undressed trio as they return. That night a distraught Davis kills himself with a razor blade. While bleeding to death, he presses the button in his cell for help, but is ignored by warder Greaves.

Davis&#x27;s suicide is the last straw for the Borstal inmates. In the dining hall, having collected their food, the inmates sit silently, refusing to eat. Carlin initiates a full-scale riot in the dinner hall. Carlin, Archer and Meakin are later shown being dragged, bleeding and unconscious, into solitary confinement after having been beaten by the wardens. The Borstal&#x27;s Governor later informs them the damage to the dinner hall will be repaid through lost earnings. The Governor then declares a minute&#x27;s silent prayer for Davis and Toyne.

== Deviations from original BBC production ==
The film differs from the original BBC production in many respects. The film contains strong language and is much more violent and graphic than the milder BBC version. Ray Winstone, John Blundell, Phil Daniels, John Judd, Ray Burdis and Patrick Murray all reprise their respective roles as Carlin, Banks, Richards, Sands, Eckersley and Dougan from the BBC version, while all other roles are recast. David Threlfall had been intended to reprise his role as Archer from the BBC version, but he was working with the Royal Shakespeare Company at the time and was subsequently replaced by Mick Ford. The story was also changed. The BBC version features a homosexual relationship between Carlin and another inmate, which was dropped from the film. Minton later said that this was a pity as it would have expanded Carlin&#x27;s character and made him vulnerable in an area where he could not afford to be vulnerable.

The television play version of the film also features less graphic rape and suicide scenes. An additional scene shows Davis trying to talk to Carlin about the incident. Carlin dismisses him when he is reluctant to talk in front of Carlin&#x27;s &#x27;missus&#x27; (partner). In the remake, the relationship between Carlin and his &#x27;missus&#x27; does not feature. Instead, during the mess, Davis looks up at Carlin from the dining table as if about to confide in him, but Carlin unwittingly chooses that moment to get up and leave.

Also in the television play, it is made clear at the end of the film that Banks is in hospital – resulting from the beating administered by Carlin when ousting him as the &quot;daddy&quot;; in the theatrical version he is present at the end moment of silence.

==Release==
The film had its UK premiere at the Prince Charles Cinema in London. It opened on 20 September 1979 at the Prince Charles Cinema and finished fifth at the London box office with a gross of £18,074 in its first week.

=== 2017 re-release ===
In 2017, Kino Lorber re-released the film in selected theatres for a limited time. In the United States, the film grossed $5,405.

== Critical reception ==
In a High Court case against Channel 4 for showing the film, British morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse initially won her private prosecution, but the decision was later reversed on appeal. The Independent Broadcasting Authority had approved on its transmission. However, the film was well received by critics, and today enjoys a reputation of a classic cult movie.

Philip Thomas of &quot;Empire&quot; said of the film, &quot;&quot;Scum&quot;&#x27;s brutality makes it a genuinely harrowing film. The bleak, snow-dusted locations, the featureless interiors of the institution, the perfect casting and magnificent acting of the indifferent and brutal staff make borstal appear to be what can only be described as a living hell.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on reviews from 9 critics. Metacritic gives the film a score of 78 out of 100, based on reviews by 11 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In 2010, a Canadian film heavily based on &quot;Scum&quot;, titled &quot;Dog Pound&quot;, was released.

==Home media==
The film was first released on VHS video in the UK in 1983, where it was immediately caught up in the UK video nasty controversy of the early 1980s.

It was later released on DVD in the UK by Odyssey and Prism Leisure. It was the digitally remastered uncut version but in fullscreen, with only a trailer and an interview as bonus features. In the US an Alan Clarke boxset was issued that included several films, among them both the BBC original and cinema version of the film plus audio commentaries. Prism Leisure released a limited edition 2 disc set in the UK on 13 June 2005. Disc One featured the BBC version with an audio commentary and two interviews. Disc Two instead featured the theatrical remake with an audio commentary, several interviews and featurettes and two trailers. It was digitally remastered from a widescreen print. This special edition DVD was sold in amaray slipcase packaging and also in a limited edition tin case. A Region 0 DVD boxset featuring both the theatrical version and the 1977 BBC-banned television version on separate discs followed in the US, released by Blue Underground. In 2015, Australian company Shock Entertainment released &quot;Scum&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray as part of their Cinema Cult line.

<text>Theodor Johan Christian Ambders Brorsen (29 July 1819 – 31 March 1895) was a Danish astronomer. He is best known for his discovery of five comets, including the lost periodic comet, 5D/Brorsen, and the periodic comet 23P/Brorsen-Metcalf.

== Life ==

Theodor Johan Christian Ambders Brorsen was born in Nordborg on the island Als, (South Jutland), as son of the captain Christian August Brorsen (1793-1840) and Annette Margrethe Gerhardine Schumacher (1788-1855). He got his three middle names after the maternal grandfather of his mother, the Nordborg counsel Johan Christian Ambders (1710-1795). After the amicable divorce of his parents in 1822, Brorsen grew up at his mother&#x27;s. Her good financial circumstances allowed him to attend the school of the Moravians in Christiansfeld (1826-1829) and then, from 1830 to 1839, the Latin school in Flensburg. By request of his mother, Brorsen studied law in Kiel (1839), Berlin (1840), Heidelberg (1841), and again in Kiel (1842), until he decided to follow his inclinations and studied astronomy in Kiel in 1844.

Brorsen worked at the astronomical observatory of Kiel in 1846, and at the Altona Observatory in 1847. He rejected a job offer from the astronomical observatory &quot;Rundetaarn&quot; (Round tower) in Copenhagen. Instead, he accepted a job at the private observatory of baron John Parish (1774-1858, an Englishman, also known as Freiherr von Senftenberg) in Žamberk (at the time called Senftenberg) in the present-day Czech Republic. When the post of the director of the astronomical observatory of Altona became vacant in 1854, Brorsen applied for it, but was not chosen. After the death of baron Parish in 1858, his heirs had the observatory of Senftenberg dismantled and the astronomical instruments were sold, although Brorsen offered to continue his work for free. Nevertheless. Brorsen remained in Senftenberg for another 12 years, and continued his observations with his own instruments.

In 1870, he returned to his home town of Nordborg in South Jutland, which had become Prussian since the Second War of Schleswig in 1864, and subsequently was German from 1871 up to the plebiscite of 1920. In 1874, Brorsen moved into the house Løjtertoft 11, where he lived until his death. His unmarried half sister, Amalie Petrine Brorsen (1832-1911), kept the house for him. In his years in Nordborg, however, Brorsen hardly occupied himself with astronomy any more. His main interests were meteorology (also observations of the Northern Lights), as well as botany, especially orchid breeding.
Personally, Brorsen was an introverted character with relationship anxieties. He twice broke off an engagement in the last moment (first one to Louise Lassen from Sønderborg, then another one to Miss Bernkopf from Žamberk) and hence remained unmarried. Besides, there are testimonies that Brorsen developed self-willed habits in the last 25 years of his life spent in Nordborg. He did not take much care for his clothing, he let his hair grow long, and when his boots pressed his feet, he cut holes into his boots in the tight places. He used to take a daily bath in the Oldenor, a lake in Nordborg; in winter, he hoed a hole into the ice for that purpose. Brorsen died at 75 years of age, and was buried on 5 April 1895 in the cemetery of Nordborg where his grave is still preserved today.

== Discoveries ==

* Brorsen discovered five comets: 1846 III, 1846 VII, 1847 V, 1851 III and 1851 IV. Two of them were named after Brorsen as they are periodic comets. The comet 1846 III is called Brorsen and the comet 1847 V is named Brorsen-Metcalf (because Joel Hastings Metcalf was its rediscoverer in 1919).

:The comet 5D/Brorsen (with a period of 5.46 years) was last seen in 1879. In all, five of its rotations around the Sun were observed. It belonged to the Jupiter comet family, whose comets can be short-lived- it may not exist today.

:The comet 23P/Brorsen-Metcalf (with a period of 69.06 years) was observed in 1847, 1919 and 1989. It belongs to the Halley comet family and is to be expected for 2059 again.

* In 1850, Brorsen (re-)discovered an emission nebula in the constellation Orion: NGC 2024, also known as Flame Nebula. It had already been observed, however, by William Herschel in 1786, as we know today.
* Brorsen might have discovered a sixth comet on 16 March 1854; this discovery could not be confirmed by other astronomers, though.
* In 1854, Brorsen published the first thorough investigations of the so-called gegenschein (counter shine) of the Zodiacal light. He was also able to explain that phenomenon correctly. Besides, Brorsen was the first to discover that the Zodiacal light can embrace the complete sky, because, under favorable conditions, a feeble light bridge connecting the Zodiacal light and the counter glow can be observed.
* In 1856, Brorsen discovered a globular cluster in the constellation Serpens, which was later catalogued as NGC 6539.
* Further, Brorsen investigated the occultations and proper motions of stars. In the field of theoretical astronomy, Brorsen calculated the perihelia of comet and planet orbits.

== Honors ==

* For each of his first three comet discoveries, Brorsen was awarded a golden comet medal by the Danish king Christian VIII. The medal that he got in 1846 can be seen today in the museum at Sønderborg castle, see here.
* Brorsen was appointed a corresponding member of the nature historic society in Žamberk in 1850.
* Today, in Nordborg, a street, &quot;Th. Brorsens vej&quot;, is named after Brorsen.
* The asteroid 3979, which was discovered by A. Mrkos in Klet on 8 November 1983 was named &quot;Brorsen&quot; on proposal of J. Tichá (MPC 27734 – 1996 August 28).

<text>Costanzo Festa (c. 1485/1490 – 10 April 1545) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance. While he is best known for his madrigals, he also wrote sacred vocal music. He was the first native Italian polyphonist of international renown, and with Philippe Verdelot, one of the first to write madrigals, in the infancy of that most popular of all sixteenth-century Italian musical forms.

==Life==
Not much is known about his early life. He was probably born in the Piedmont near Turin, but the evidence is not certain, being based mainly on later documents referring to him as a &quot;clericis secularibus&quot;, i.e. not a monk, from that region. His birth date has been given as early as 1480 and as late as 1495, but recent scholarship has tended to narrow the range to the late 1480s. In addition he may have been related to his slightly younger contemporary Sebastiano Festa, another early madrigal composer, also from the same region. Sebastiano&#x27;s father, Jacobinus, was a resident in Turin around 1520.

In early 1514, Festa wrote a motet, &quot;Quis dabit oculis&quot;, on the occasion of the death of the Queen of France (Anne of Brittany) (9 January 1514). Anne&#x27;s funeral was an extensive affair, lasting 40 days; Johannes Prioris also composed music for it. This motet is the earliest datable composition of Festa&#x27;s, and the first record of his activity.

In 1514, Festa visited Ferrara, bringing some motets with him; he seems to have been an established composer by this time, as indicated by the reception he received. This motet appears in a manuscript copied between 1516 and 1519, which also contains music by Sebastiano Festa, his possible relative; since the manuscript is thought to have been copied in northeast Italy, one or more of the motets it contains, may have been those he brought to Ferrara. Most likely after his visit to Ferrara, but certainly between 1510 and 1517, he lived on Ischia, an island in the bay of Naples, where he served as a music teacher to the aristocratic d&#x27;Avalos family. In 1517, he moved to Rome and began employment with Pope Leo X as a singer, and his association with the Sistine Chapel choir was to continue uninterrupted for almost 30 years. In September 1536, he wrote to Filippo Strozzi, his patron, to help him find a Venetian printer willing to print a book of his liturgical music similar to the ones being printed in Rome by Andrea Antico; he wanted the sum of 200 &quot;scudi&quot; for the job, but was unsuccessful. During this era, printers more often demanded money from composers for the privilege of publication than the other way around.

Festa was active as a composer throughout the period, and some of the earliest madrigals identifiable as such, by any composer, may come from his pen and date from the mid 1520s; only some compositions by Bernardo Pisano, Sebastiano Festa, and possibly Philippe Verdelot may predate them by a few years. While he was unsuccessful in his attempted sale to the Venetian printer in 1536, a Roman firm produced a book of madrigals in 1538, as a result of the privilege granted, but most of it has been lost. In 1537, a Venetian firm printed a collection of his madrigals for three voices.

An unusual number of Festa&#x27;s works can be dated precisely, since some of the compositions are topical, referring to weddings, visits, deaths, and other events (some composers of the Renaissance, such as Josquin des Prez, wrote an immense amount of music, almost none of which can be dated precisely). Among the dateable compositions is the motet for Anne of Brittany; compositions copied in a manuscript between 1515 and 1519; a motet protesting the 1527 sack of Rome; some madrigals Festa sent to Strozzi in 1528 (they were named &quot;canti&quot;); a lost 1533 madrigal to a poem by Michelangelo; music for a 1539 Medici wedding; and other compositions in hand-written manuscripts which have been dated.

A communication from 1543 indicates that Festa was too sick to travel with the Pope to Bologna, and he died in Rome in 1545.

==Music and influence==
Festa was one of the few Italians in the Papal Choir, which at that time was dominated by musicians from northern Europe. He was a master of the Netherlands contrapuntal technique, however, and his importance to music history is as the one who first brought the two musical styles, the Italian and the Netherlandish, together. In addition, he was an obvious influence on Palestrina, who modeled many of his early works after his.

Most of Festa&#x27;s madrigals are for three voices, in contrast to the other early madrigalists: for example Verdelot preferred five or six voices, while Sebastiano Festa only wrote for four. He liked quick, rhythmically active passages in his madrigals; this may reflect an influence from the contemporary vocal form of the &quot;villanesca.&quot; In addition, he wrote extended homophonic sections, showing somewhat less influence from the contemporary motet, in contrast to the motet-like imitative passages found in Verdelot.

In addition to his madrigals, published mostly between 1543 and 1549, several collections of his sacred works were published during his lifetime, among them four masses, over forty motets, a set of Lamentations, and numerous Magnificats and Marian Litanies (for two choruses, each with four voices). The style of his sacred music matches that of his secular: he was less fond of imitation and complex counterpoint for its own sake, and often wrote purely homophonic passages. Since Rome was musically conservative compared to the rest of Italy (and Europe) at the time, and there was a strong reaction against elaborate counterpoint within two decades after his death (expressly stated by the Council of Trent), his stylistic bent may represent a foreshadowing of that event; perhaps he was responding to the taste and needs of his papal employer.

===&quot;La Spagna&quot;===
Festa also wrote instrumental music. His most famous instrumental output is the monumental scholastic counterpoint study on &quot;La Spagna&quot; on which he wrote 125 variations using it as &quot;cantus firmus.&quot; &quot;La Spagna&quot; comes from a presumably Spanish &quot;Basse danse&quot; (&quot;bassadanza&quot;) well known by several famous composers of his time: Josquin himself wrote a variation on &quot;La Spagna.&quot; This work is also called &quot;I bassi&quot; and is a compendium of ways to combine the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; with added counterpoint or &#x27;basses&#x27;, suitable for any instruments. For a long time, musicologists believed that these variations were by Nanino, who one or even two generations after Festa, published his 28 motets on &quot;La spagna&quot; together with the 125 variations of Festa without mentioning the name Festa. Later commentators were led to assume that all of these 157 pieces were written by Nanino and this confused the whole research after the legendary study. Recent research leaves no doubt that the first 125 counterpoints are by Festa himself. What Festa does with the &quot;cantus firmus,&quot; a simple melody containing 37 notes, is not only extravagant and amazingly creative. He shows practically all possibilities of counterpoint technique of his time, using canons (even triple canon), imitations, free or strict counterpoint, all styles of instrumental and vocal composition technique like using &quot;soggetti cavati,&quot; plainchant paraphrases, retrograde counterpoint, ostinatos, quodlibets, using 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and at the end 11 voices. He experimented with different rhythmical patterns (mensural problems) such as using two different tempo signatures (proportions), keys or rhythmically extremely complex bars with 7:5:3 proportions or other admirable ideas such as using the &quot;cantus firmus&quot; in a canon or putting the cantus firmus in every possible location in the texture. The studies on &quot;La Spagna&quot; showed that he also used &quot;musica ficta&quot; and a lot of Christian and ancient symbolics (numerology) as well as hidden or obvious symmetrical structures in his counterpoints.

The 125 counterpoints on &quot;La Spagna&quot; certainly belong to the most interesting works of Festa and probably even of his time and could be seen as a lifetime work. Even when it was considered as a pure &#x27;scholastic work&#x27; with somehow too much use of strict technique and &quot;construction&quot;, sometimes rather archaic and with pure mathematical logic, it remains remarkable that he wrote it as a compendium for learning how to sing and compose and to learn about all the secrets of counterpoint mastery. It must be seen as one of Festa&#x27;s best and outstanding works. A monumental study by a Renaissance genius, its first successor two centuries later was Fux&#x27;s &quot;Gradus ad parnassum&quot; and in complexity it rather should be compared even with J.S. Bach&#x27;s speculative late work.

An indication of Festa&#x27;s fame is his appearance in the introduction to Book Four of &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot; by François Rabelais. In the song Festa and others sing, Priapus boasts to the gods on Mount Olympus of his method of deflowering a new bride with a wooden mallet. Festa is the only Italian among the large group of singers listed by Rabelais, which appear to be a collection of the most famous musicians of the age.

<doc id="631260" wikidata="Q747516" url="?curid=631260" title="House of Aviz">
<text>The House of Aviz (Portuguese: &quot;Casa de Avis&quot; ), also known as the Joanine Dynasty (&quot;Dinastia Joanina&quot;), was a dynasty of Portuguese origin which flourished during the Renaissance and the period of the Portuguese discoveries, when Portugal expanded its power globally.

The house was founded by King John I of Portugal, Grand-Master of the Order of Aviz and illegitimate son of King Pedro I (of the Portuguese House of Burgundy), who ascended to the throne after successfully pressing his claim during the 1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum. Aviz monarchs would rule Portugal through the Age of Discovery, establishing Portugal as a global power following the creation of the Portuguese Empire. In 1494, Pope Alexander VI divided the world under the dominion of Portugal and Spain with the Treaty of Tordesillas.

The House of Aviz has produced numerous prominent figures in both European and global history, including Prince Henry the Navigator, King Manuel I of Portugal, and Holy Roman Empress Isabella of Portugal. Numerous Aviz dynasts have also claimed thrones or titles across Europe, including King Peter V of Aragon and John, Prince of Antioch. The Aviz ruled Portugal from 1385 until 1580, when the Philippine Dynasty succeeded to the throne following the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580.

== History ==
===Origins===
The founder of the House of Aviz, King John I of Portugal, was born in 1357 as the illegitimate child of King Pedro I of Portugal, a member of the Portuguese House of Burgundy, and Teresa Lourenço, daughter of a Lisbon merchant. In 1364, at 7 years old, John was made Grand Master of the Order of Aviz, henceforth becoming known as John of Aviz.

===Rise to the throne===

The House of Aviz was established as a result of the dynastic crisis following the 1383 death of Ferdinand I. Ferdinand&#x27;s widow Leonor Telles was disliked by both the nobility and the commoners for having left her first husband and for having had their marriage annulled in order to marry King Ferdinand. Ferdinand&#x27;s designated heir was their only surviving child Beatrice, married to John I of Castile who claimed the throne in the name of his wife, but under the Treaty of Salvaterra that had been the basis for John&#x27;s marriage to Beatrice, the unpopular Leonor was left as Regent until such time as the son of Beatrice and John would be 14 years old.

In April 1385, amidst popular revolt and civil war, the Cortes of Coimbra declared John, Master of Aviz, as king John I of Portugal. He was half-brother of Ferdinand and natural son of Ferdinand&#x27;s father and predecessor Pedro I. He had the particular backing of the rising bourgeoisie of Lisbon; the nobility were split, with the majority favoring the legitimist Beatrice. Troops under General Nuno Álvares Pereira defeated a small Castilian army at Atoleiros, while John of Castile had to lift a siege to Lisboa, mainly due to a plague that hit his army and killed his wife Beatrice. This was followed, however, by a larger invasion of Castilian and Portuguese troops loyal to John of Castile.

John of Aviz&#x27;s rule became established fact with the Portuguese victory in the Battle of Aljubarrota on 14 August 1385, where he defeated John I of Castile. A formal peace between Portugal and Castile would not be signed until 1411.

To mark his victory, John founded the Monastery of Santa Maria da Vitória, known as the &quot;Batalha Monastery&quot; (&quot;Battle Monastery&quot;), whose chapel became the burial place of the princes of the new dynasty of Aviz. The descendants of King John I were still also Masters of Aviz, though at times that title passed to one descendant of John and the Crown of Portugal to another. The title of Grand Master of the Order of Aviz was permanently incorporated into the Portuguese Crown toward the end of rule by the House of Aviz, in 1551.

===Age of Discoveries===
The House of Aviz would rule Portugal until its fall in the 1580 to the Philippine Dynasty. after he had ordered the Duke of Alba to take Portugal by force.

This period of Portuguese history saw the ascent of Portugal to the status of a European and world power. The conquest of Ceuta in 1415 was its first venture in colonial expansion, followed by a great outpouring of national energy and capital investment in the exploration of Africa, Asia and Brazil with the founding of colonies to exploit their resources commercially. The period also includes the zenith of the Portuguese Empire during the reign of Manuel I and the beginning of its decline during John III&#x27;s reign.

===Fall of the Aviz===

John III was succeeded in 1557 by his grandson Sebastian I of Portugal, who died, aged 24 and childless, in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir. Sebastian was succeeded by his great-uncle Henry, aged 66, who, as a Catholic Cardinal, also had no children. The Cardinal-King Henry died two years later, and a succession crisis occurred when pretenders to the throne including Catherine, Duchess of Braganza, Philip II of Spain, and António, Prior of Crato claimed the right to inherit it.

António, Prior of Crato, was acclaimed king in several cities around the country in 1580, twenty days before Philip II of Spain invaded Portugal and defeated the supporters of António in the Battle of Alcântara. Although António had been proclaimed king, and was still regarded as rightful king in some of the Azores Islands until 1583, his legitimacy as a monarch is still disputed by historians. Only a small minority of historians (even in Portugal) accept the period of twenty days between Anthony&#x27;s acclamation and the Battle of Alcântara as his reign. In Portugal he generally considered not as a national king, but as a patriot who led armed resistance to the Philippine domination.

Joaquim Veríssimo Serrão, writing in 1956 and counting António as a king, dates the end of the dynasty&#x27;s rule of Portugal as occurring in 1581–1582. The Cortes of Tomar had acclaimed Philip II of Spain as Philip I of Portugal in 1581, subsequently António&#x27;s forces were utterly defeated at sea by Álvaro de Bazán at the Battle of Ponta Delgada off São Miguel Island in the Azores, on 26 July 1582. António then retreated to Terceira, where he supervised the raising of levies for defense, but in November he left Angra do Heroísmo en route to France to persuade the French to furnish more troops, 800 of which arrived in June 1583. Philip had despatched Santa Cruz with an overwhelming force which left Lisbon on 23 June, and reaching sight of São Miguel some time after 7 July, finally reduced the Azores to subjection.

The &quot;Cortes&quot; in Tomar acknowledged Philip II of Spain as King Philip I of Portugal on 16 April 1581 after this Spanish military intervention. From 1581, the House of Aviz had ceased to rule any portion of continental Portugal; António, Prior of Crato held out in the Azores into 1582 as &quot;António I of Portugal&quot;; the last of his allies in the islands finally surrendered in 1583.

The House of Aviz was succeeded in Portugal by Philip&#x27;s personal union of the Crowns of Portugal and Spain. In Portuguese history this is variously referred to as the Philippine Dynasty, the House of Habsburg, or the House of Austria. Portugal and Spain would share a common monarch until 1640, upon the proclamation of the Duke of Braganza as John IV of Portugal.

===Cross of Aviz===
Following his success in succeeding to the throne following the 1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum, King John I of Portugal took the Cross of the Order of Aviz as his heraldic badge, adding it to the coat of arms of Portugal and the according royal flags. King John I enforced the imagery of his position as Grand-Master of the Order of Aviz, lending its name to his newly founded royal house and its cross as his personal charge on the royal arms. This was effected in various ways: by insertion within the bordure, alternating with the castles; more commonly inserted within the shield, and occasionally shown outside the shield with the latter laying over it. The Cross of Aviz is a &quot;cross flory vert&quot; (a green cross with a fleur-de-lys at the end of each arm)

===Armillary sphere===

The armillary sphere has been an important element of Portuguese heraldry since the reign of King Manuel I of Portugal. The armillary sphere became a royal badge for the Portuguese monarchy, apart from being part of the personal standard of King Manuel I. It acts as a supporter to the Coat of arms of Portugal, also present on the current Flag of Portugal.

Owing to the association with King Manuel I and other Aviz monarchs with the Portuguese discoveries, the armillary sphere was commonly used as a symbol representing Portuguese sovereignty across the Portuguese Empire. The symbol was a consistent motif in both Manueline and Neo-Manueline architecture. It also became particularly associated with Colonial Brazil and the subsequent United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves.

An important element of Portuguese heraldry since the 15th century, the armillary sphere was many times used in Portuguese naval and colonial flags, mainly in Brazil. It was a navigation instrument used to calculate distances and represents the importance of Portugal during the Age of Discovery, as well as the vastness of its colonial empire when the First Republic was implemented.

<text>Schwedt (or Schwedt/Oder; ) is a town in Brandenburg, in northeastern Germany. With the official status of a &quot;Große kreisangehörige Stadt&quot; (major district town), it is the largest town of the Uckermark district, located near the river Oder, which forms the border with Poland.

==Overview==
The formerly agrarian town today has one of the largest oil refineries (&quot;PCK Raffinerie GmbH&quot;) in Germany, established in 1958 and connected to the Russian Druzhba pipeline network. The refinery uses 20 million cubic meters of water per year for the process.

A large paper factory (&quot;UPM&quot;) is located near Schwedt. Most industries were located in the remote area during communist rule in the 1960s and 1970s.

Large residential areas were built for the workers moving to Schwedt. About 9% of the town&#x27;s flats are in prefab concrete buildings (&quot;Plattenbau&quot;) dating from the era. As many jobs were lost after German reunification and the return to market economy, Schwedt has lost a quarter of its population since 1990. In recent decades, Schwedt became a model town for the demolition of &quot;Plattenbau&quot; housing to combat urban decay.

==Geography==
Schwedt is situated in the east of the historic Uckermark region stretching from the Oder to the Havel River. It is situated on a sandur at the western edge of the Oder floodplain running along the German-Polish border, which in 1995 was declared as the Lower Oder Valley National Park nature reserve. Across the river and the border, about to the southeast, is the Polish town of Chojna. The nearest German towns are Angermünde (about to the west) and Gartz ( down the Oder).

===Local districts===
In a 1974 municipal reform, the neighbouring village of Heinersdorf was incorporated into Schwedt, followed by Blumenhagen, Gatow and Kunow in 1993, by Kummerow in 1998, by Criewen and Zützen in 2001, Stendell in 2002, the former town Vierraden in 2003, Schöneberg in January 2021 and Berkholz-Meyenburg, Mark Landin and Passow in April 2022. With Schwedt is among the 10 largest German municipalities by area (9th as of Nov. 2023).

==History==
After the Migration Period, the area had been settled by Polabian Slavs. From 937 onwards the lands of the Slavic Ukrani tribes in the west were subdued by the Saxon forces of Margrave Gero and incorporated into his vast &quot;Marca Geronis&quot;, while the lands east of the Oder were held by Pomeranian tribes under sovereignty of the newly formed Duchy of Poland ruled by Duke Mieszko I. The Saxon Northern March was lost in the Great Slav Rising of 983, and not before 1147 the Saxon count Albert the Bear again invaded the lands on the Oder river, which remained disputed between the newly established Margraviate of Brandenburg and the Pomeranian dukes.

The settlement of Schwedt was first mentioned in a 1265 deed. In the course of the Brandenburg–Pomeranian conflict, the Brandenburg margrave Louis II the Roman ceded it to Duke Barnim III of Pomerania in 1354. It was again besieged by the first Hohenzollern margrave Frederick I in 1434, but to no avail. In 1481 the Thuringian counts of Hohnstein acquired the estates; they granted town privileges to Schwedt as well as to neighbouring Vierraden and introduced the Protestant Reformation.

The rise of Schwedt came to an end with the extinction of the Hohnstein counts in 1609 and the disastrous Thirty Years&#x27; War, when the town on the road from Stettin to Berlin was plundered several times. In 1631 King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, after landing in Pomerania, camped here on his way to the Battle of Breitenfeld. Six years later the Swedish field marshal Johan Banér set the town on fire, after its citizens refused to capitulate.

During the Great Northern War, the Treaty of Schwedt was signed in the town.

From 1815 to 1945, Schwedt was part of the Prussian Province of Brandenburg.

Near the end of World War II, over two months of heavy fighting destroyed an estimated 85 percent of the town, including the Schwedt Castle. The Soviet Army occupied Schwedt on April 26, 1945, two weeks before the final defeat of Nazi Germany. From 1945 to 1952, Schwedt was part of the state of Brandenburg and from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Frankfurt of East Germany. During the 1960s, the government of the DDR expanded housing and encouraged people to move to Schwedt, a trend that ended with German reunification. Since 1990, Schwedt is again part of the State of Brandenburg.

<doc id="631264" wikidata="Q484082" url="?curid=631264" title="Fin.K.L">
<text>Fin.K.L () is a South Korean girl group formed by DSP Media in 1998 consisting of members Lee Hyori, Ock Joo-hyun, Lee Jin, and Sung Yu-ri. Fin.K.L was one of the most popular K-pop groups of the late 1990s and early 2000s, alongside rival girl group S.E.S. The group cemented their popularity in South Korea with the release the songs &quot;To My Boyfriend&quot; in 1998, &quot;Eternal Love&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Now&quot; in 2000.

The group released four full-length albums: &quot;Blue Rain&quot; (1998), &quot;White&quot; (1999), &quot;Now&quot; (2000), and &quot;Forever&quot; (2002). They won several major awards including New Artist of the Year at the 1998 Golden Disc Awards, the Grand Prize at the 1999 Seoul Music Awards, and Best Female Group at the 2000 Mnet Music Video Festival.

Fin.K.L became inactive after releasing the single, &quot;FinKL&quot;, in 2005. However, Fin.K.L reunited on a variety show in July 2019 and released &quot;Fin.K.L Best Album&quot;, including a new song titled &quot;Just Like the Song That Remains&quot; on September 22.

== Name ==
Their name stands for Fin Killing Liberty, and was intended to mean that the group stood against &quot;the oppression of all freedom&quot; (&quot;&quot; means &quot;end&quot; in Spanish and French). The group&#x27;s name was selected by a poll of young people by the record company before the group&#x27;s inception. This is the reason for the lack of clear meaning in Fin.K.L&#x27;s English name, for the Korean name was selected first.

==History==

=== 1998: Formation and debut ===
The first member to be discovered for Fin.K.L was its lead singer, Ock Joo-hyun. She was discovered through a radio singing contest, which she won by singing Mariah Carey&#x27;s 1993 hit &quot;Hero&quot;. Ock told her friend Lee Jin about this group and encouraged her to join; Lee was selected after singing Eco&#x27;s &quot;Blessed Me&quot; () for her audition. The next member to be selected was Sung Yu-ri, who was discovered while on a school field trip. As for the fourth member, Annie Lee (who formed Tashannie with Yoon Mi-rae) was accepted, but decided to depart after a few months. Lee Hyori, who was found while in a mall taking sticker pictures with friends, was brought into the group.

Fin.K.L debuted in 1998 with its first album &quot;Blue Rain&quot;. The trend of late 1990s K-pop was to have groups sing cute, catchy music, as evidenced by the success of SM Entertainment groups S.E.S. and H.O.T. In contrast, Fin.K.L&#x27;s initial strength was in R&amp;B ballads led by Ock&#x27;s vocals; this was shown by their first single &quot;Blue Rain&quot;. Fin.K.L&#x27;s next hit &quot;To My Boyfriend&quot; () was a more typical pop song and followed popular conventions at the time. (Yuki Hsu, a Taiwanese singer, sang a remake version of &quot;To My Boyfriend&quot; not long after the song&#x27;s success in South Korea.) They capped off their first album activities with a third single, &quot;Ruby&quot; (), which was a ballad about a lost love, and giving that love up for the good of everyone involved. The group also created a music video for a fourth single (which was eventually just left as a video and not promoted).

=== 1999: &quot;White&quot; and &quot;S.P.E.C.I.A.L&quot; ===
Fin.K.L released a follow-up album on May 13, 1999, with &quot;White&quot;. Two hit songs from this album were &quot;Eternal Love&quot; () and &quot;Pride (). Their second album had less of a focus on ballads, although the slow R&amp;B song &quot;Waiting for You&quot; was performed occasionally. Also, Fin.K.L began limiting their music videos to one or two per album; a video was never made for &quot;Waiting for You&quot;. Like their first, this album was very successful, selling almost 700,000 copies.

The group released a &quot;decimalized&quot; or &quot;half&quot; album (which usually signifies either a limited or special release, such as a cover album or a themed record). Their first &quot;half&quot; album was released on November 24, 1999, and their two most famous songs from this album were &quot;To My Prince&quot; (), a ballad, and &quot;White&quot; (), a seasonal pop song. &quot;S.P.E.C.I.A.L&quot; also contained a remake version of &quot;Like an Indian Doll&quot; (), a popular song sung by Na-mi (나미) in 1989. No music videos were made in support of the album&#x27;s release. The album sold in excess of 340,000 copies.

Because of its release date, Fin.K.L created a &quot;winter&quot; theme for their performances and dressed in wintry outfits to promote &quot;White&quot;. To complete the theme, they often had fake snow falling during their &quot;White&quot; performances; however, this created a problem in that the snow was quite slippery, causing members and back-up dancers to slip and even occasionally fall. Due to the limited release of the album, Fin.K.L has a shorter promotion schedule. However, both of these 1999 albums helped Fin.K.L win a &quot;daesang&quot; (Korean for &#x27;grand prize&#x27;) at the end of the year.

=== 2000–2001: &quot;Now&quot; and &quot;Melodies &amp; Memories&quot; ===
Fin.K.L&#x27;s third album &quot;Now&quot;, released on October 6, 2000, emphasized the physical maturity of Fin.K.L members. Unlike the previous catchy tunes and cute outfits, Fin.K.L members were dressed in semi-formal attire for performances for the hit single &quot;Now&quot; (the album&#x27;s title song). &quot;Feel Your Love&quot;, their follow-up single, had their members in school uniforms that signified transformation to womanhood. Only &quot;Now&quot; was promoted with a music video and a busy performance schedule; the second single was relatively ignored. The album sold over 400,000 copies.

The group released their second &quot;half&quot; album on April 13, 2001, 6 months after their last album. &quot;Melodies &amp; Memories&quot; was a special album consisting of remakes of Korean hits from the 80s and 90s. Instead of targeting their main fanbase of teenage listeners, this album appealed to adults in their 20s and 30s by arousing nostalgia. Singles from this album include Lee Ye-rin&#x27;s &quot;Always Like This Moment&quot; (), and Hye Eun-yi&#x27;s 1981 single &quot;You Wouldn&#x27;t Know&quot; (). Like their third album, &quot;Memories &amp; Melodies&quot; only had one music video promoting the album (the one for &quot;You Wouldn&#x27;t Know&quot;). However, much effort went into this video, as it recreated scenes from four popular movies for each of the members, including scenes from &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. Sales at the end of 2001 totaled 259,259 copies.

In 2000, they also recorded &quot;True Love&quot; for a South Korean drama, &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

=== 2002: &quot;Forever&quot; ===
Their last studio album so far was released in the spring of 2002. The first single, &quot;Forever&quot; (), is a pop ballad about waiting forever for a lost love. This was accompanied by a video depicting four tragic stories mainly about the loss of innocence: Sung portrays a masseuse, Ock a sick florist, Lee Jin a frustrated artist who eventually kills herself, and Lee Hyori as a boxer who loses a finger. This song became very popular, although it was not as heavily promoted as their other lead singles. Their second single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away&quot;, was chosen by the fans via the group&#x27;s website, because it was felt that Fin.K.L had not had an upbeat single for a while. However, this single was promoted for a short time before being abruptly dropped. By the end of 2002, the album sold 261,518 copies.

=== 2003–2006: Solo activities, &quot;FinKL&quot; and disbandment ===
Fin.K.L decided to go their separate ways, although not officially breaking up. Lee Hyori and Ock have since released solo albums, while Lee Jin and Sung have acted in dramas and hosted various shows. At the end of 2005, the group made a comeback and released &quot;FinKL&quot;, a digital single that had 4 songs (including the title track) and a music video. However, due to lack of promotion (as the group did not perform on the various music shows), the single failed to chart. Instead of ignoring the single, though, they have since released a special &quot;Fin.K.L Forever&quot; set that had two DVDs (one with their music videos and the other with various performances) and a photobook that also had the &quot;FinKL&quot; single in CD form.

They have continued to work in the entertainment industry and stay in the public eye. Sung has continued acting, starting with the drama &quot;Bad Girls&quot; () and receiving positive attention in 2003 for &quot;Thousand Years of Love&quot; (). Sung also played the lead roles in the dramas &quot;My Platoon Leader&quot; () and &quot;First Love of a Royal Prince&quot; (). She was also in the drama series, &quot;One Fine Day&quot; () and &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; (), she received high praise and won awards for both performances in 2006. Sung also starred as Heo Yi-nok in the drama &quot;Hong Gil-dong&quot; () co-starring Kang Ji-hwan and won a Best Couple award. Lee Jin has also worked in television, hosting various shows and even joining a popular comedy show for a season. Both Sung and Lee Jin won &quot;Best Actress&quot; in their respective categories (drama and comedy) at the end-of-year awards in 2002. Lee Jin has also debuted in the South Korean film industry and has tried to distance herself from her Fin.K.L image.

After her solo album &quot;Nan...&quot; in 2003, due to significant weight loss, Ock became very popular in 2004. She debuted as a musical actress in 2005 in &quot;Aida&quot;, and after initial struggles has since went on to become one of the highest profile musical actresses in Korea with ticketing power rivaling her male counterparts, having starred in the Korean-language adaptations of &quot;Rebecca&quot;, &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, &quot;Wicked&quot;, &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;, &quot;Chicago&quot;, original musical &quot;Mata Hari&quot;, and many more. Her third and last studio album, &quot;Remind&quot;, came out in 2007, she has since released OSTs and independent ballads. Lee Hyori, though, has been the standout solo member, releasing her first solo album in 2003 which catapulted her to the top of the charts and won her many advertising contracts. However, she encountered controversy on her second album&#x27;s lead song &quot;Get Ya!&quot;, because it had elements that were very similar to Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;Do Somethin&#x27;&quot;. Although she moved on to her second single &quot;Shall We Dance?&quot;, promotional activities were quickly stopped. Her 2007 single &quot;Toc Toc Toc&quot;, released in March 2007, reached #1 on the Music Industry Association of South Korea&#x27;s monthly charts.

By the fall of 2006, all the members of Fin.K.L had left DSP Entertainment and signed on with different companies. Although there was continued speculation on the status of the group, Fin.K.L never officially disbanded.

=== 2008–2019: Reunions and &quot;Camping Club&quot; ===
Fin.K.L reunited and performed together on December 19, 2008, during a concert by Lee Hyori. In September 2010, Ock became the host of the KBS Cool FM music program &quot;Gayo Plaza&quot; (가요광장). Her program began airing on September 20, 2010, and her first guests were Lee Hyori, Lee Jin, and Sung as members of Fin.K.L.

In May 2019, a Fin.K.L reunion variety show was announced to air on JTBC. The television series, &quot;Camping Club&quot;, featured the Fin.K.L members reuniting and traveling around the country; the show premiered on July 14. On September 22, 2019, the group released a single, &quot;Just Like the Song That Remains&quot; (남아있는 노래처럼), marking their first release since 2005.

<doc id="631267" wikidata="Q1837675" url="?curid=631267" title="Soda (comics)">
<text>Soda is a Franco-Belgian comics series by Tome (writing) and Bruno Gazzotti (art). The first two albums and the first eleven pages of the third were drawn by Luc Warnant, and the last (thirteenth) album by Dan (Dan Verlinden). It first appeared in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Spirou&quot; on 29 April 1986.

Soda is the nickname of the main character of the series, NYPD Lieutenant David Elliot Hanneth Solomon, who masquerades as a priest for the benefit of his mother&#x27;s health. In the Finnish version his real name was changed to Patrick Timothy O&#x27;Ralley. Soda only has three fingers on his left hand.

==Synopsis==

The son of the sheriff of the town of Providence, Arizona, David Solomon moved to New York City. Unable to find work he reluctantly joined the police force, but in his letters home he led his parents to believe that he had become a parish priest. This was in order to keep their minds at ease, since they did not want him to get into such a dangerous profession like his father. When his widowed mother Mary moved into his New York flat, David was forced to maintain the deception in fear that the truth would cause her a heart attack.

Thus, when he leaves for work, &quot;Father David Solomon&quot; is dressed as a priest on his way to his chapel, but in the elevator he switches to casual clothes which he wears as Lieutenant David Solomon aka &quot;Soda&quot; of the NYPD. He switches back to his priest&#x27;s uniform when returning to the flat.

This can cause more than a few problems, and there are many times when David resolves to tell his mother the truth. However a timely reminder of her health by a third party means that he has to drop this resolution.

More often than not there is no time to switch clothing, so Soda is forced to go into action with a revolver in his priest clothes. He pays little heed to the Ten Commandments, let alone the &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot; rule!

Mary herself fears New York City so much that she sticks to staying in the flat, rarely daring to go outside. As far as she is concerned, her beloved son&#x27;s only vice is his smoking, which she keeps trying to discourage.

This premise helps to juxtapose the quiet and comfort of home life against the brutality and action of a policeman constantly chasing the dangerous elements of New York society. Sometimes the thugs that he deals with in his work find out where Soda lives, and he needs to work twice as hard to keep the criminals away from his mother and to keep her blissfully unaware of the dangers that encroach upon her (and him).

Soda&#x27;s left hand has two fingers missing and is permanently gloved. So far it has never been explained how he lost these fingers.

==Secondary characters==
Soda&#x27;s colleagues include:

Police Captain Pronzini who often takes his pets to the office only for them to fall prey to his officers&#x27; humour, which can sometime be fatal (and not for the officers).

Sergeant Babs, whose constant eating means that he is most often deskbound, but his computer skills can be very useful in obtaining information. Babs is married to Martha, a rather ferocious housewife and mother-of-five, and to whom Babs is often unfaithful.

Officer Linda Tchaikowsky is Soda&#x27;s partner in the fight against crime. Every morning she picks him up from his flat in the patrol car and drops him off in the evening — provided the case they have been handling does not result in her ending up in hospital. A divorcee, she is a tough African-American woman with rather expedient methods of getting the job done.

These characters help Soda maintain the pretense. If they have to call him and the phone is answered by Mary, they claim to be from the Salvation Army or a local convent.

==Stories==
Soda&#x27;s adventures have not been published in English, and only the first adventure was ever released in Finnish as part of Kirjakerho&#x27;s Parhaat Sarjat series (issue #30, 1989). Below is a list of the French titles, their year of publication, an English translation of the titles and a brief description.

<text>Wimpole Estate is a large estate containing Wimpole Hall, a country house located within the civil parish of Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, England, about southwest of Cambridge. The house, begun in 1640, and its of parkland and farmland are owned by the National Trust. The estate is generally open to the public and received over 335,000 visitors in 2019. 

==History==

Sited close to the great Roman road, Ermine Street, Wimpole was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086. At that time there was a moated manor house set in a small deer-park. Situated to the north and south of this were three medieval villages: Bennall End, Thresham End and Green End.

The estate was held by the Chicheley family for over 250 years, beginning in 1428 with Henry Chichele who was Archbishop of Canterbury. The last of this family to hold the house was the politician Thomas Chicheley, who was responsible for the &quot;new&quot; house that was completed in 1650. Chicheley established the &quot;formal gardens and architectural landscape&quot;. He enjoyed the house for 36 years until, weighed down by financial problems, he was forced to sell to Sir John Cutler. In 1689, Sir John gave it as a marriage settlement to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband Charles Robartes, 2nd Earl of Radnor. Lord Radnor extended the formal gardens and dug out fishponds. On the death of Elizabeth in 1697, without an heir, the estate passed to Edmund Boulter, nephew of Sir John Cutler. In 1710 it was in the possession of John Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who left it to his daughter Lady Henrietta Cavendish Holles upon his death the following year. Upon Henrietta&#x27;s marriage, in 1713, it became the possession of her husband Edward Harley, 2nd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer. In 1740, Edward sold Wimpole to Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, in order to pay off his debts. The Earls of Hardwicke held it until it passed into the hands of Thomas Agar-Robartes, 6th Viscount Clifden, and then his son, Francis Agar-Robartes, 7th Viscount Clifden who, in 1930, departed to Lanhydrock upon the death of his father.

On 27 October 1843, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert visited the hall. They listened to speeches by local politicians including Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke, and dinner was served for 26 people. A ball was held in the evening. On 28 October 1843, Her Majesty visited the farm in the morning before departing for London.

In 1938, Capt. George Bambridge and his wife, Elsie, daughter of Rudyard Kipling, purchased it after having been tenants since 1932. They used the inheritance left to them by her father, and the royalties from his books, for the long-needed refurbishment of the house and grounds. During the War, for instance, the house had no running water nor electricity. During her time at Wimpole Hall, Elsie was known to become irritated by members of the public gathering too close to the house for picnics, so much so, she once returned to an offending couple&#x27;s property and had her own picnic on their lawn. Elsie Bambridge bequeathed the house to the National Trust when she died in 1976.

Over the centuries many notable architects have worked on it, including James Gibbs (between 1713 and 1730), Henry Flitcroft (around 1749), John Soane (1790s), and H. E. Kendall (1840s). There are decorative schemes by the painter James Thornhill (1721).

Carved marble busts of the Roman emperors Trajan and Galba were returned to Wimpole in 2014 and placed on the original wooden plinths which had been carved for them by Rattee and Kett in around 1860.

==The grounds==
Wimpole Hall&#x27;s grounds, enclosed in 1302, were laid out and modified by landscape designers such as George London and Henry Wise (1693–1705), Charles Bridgeman (1720s), Robert Greening (1740s), &quot;Capability&quot; Brown (1767), and Humphry Repton (1801–1809).

Bridgeman&#x27;s formal grand avenue sweeps away from the south front of the house for two and a half miles, in contrast with the remainder of the park which was &quot;naturalised&quot; by Capability Brown. The elms were killed by Dutch elm disease, but the avenue has been replanted.

The North Park is particularly attractive with its belts of woodland, gentle rolling hills with individual trees and clumps of trees. The central feature of the North Park is the neo-Gothic Tower, Wimpole&#x27;s Folly (1768), and the restored lakes in the valley below. In the grounds are a chain of lakes (1695–1767), St Andrew&#x27;s church (1749), a home farm (1792), a walled garden (18th century), and a stable block (1851). The &quot;Dutch Garden&quot; beneath the hall was established in 1980 with the rest of the garden completed based upon the mid-19th century parterre.

==Listed buildings==
The Wimpole Park Estate contains a number of listed buildings and structures. Wimpole Hall, a neo-classical building, is Grade I listed, and the estate itself is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. The entrance gates and piers at the west entrance to the hall are listed Grade II, and the stable block is listed Grade II*.

In the gardens, a group of five vases and a copy of the sculpture &quot;Samson Slaying a Philistine&quot; are listed Grade II, as are the steps to the west of the hall and the wall and railings to the south. On the edge of the ornamental gardens the ha-ha to the north west and to the north are both listed Grade II. The Wimpole&#x27;s Folly castle on the estate is listed Grade II*.

The walled garden and the gardener&#x27;s cottage on the north side of the walled garden are both listed Grade II, as is the game larder to the north east of the hall.

==Community use==
Like many other estates managed by the National Trust, a range of organised events and less formal access arrangements now use Wimpole Park. In 2013, a national partnership between the Trust and parkrun led to the establishment of a free, weekly timed run around the park, with over 200 participants every Saturday morning.

In December 2019, the National Trust farm hosted the trial of a robot, known as Tom, that maps weeds with absolute precision. After the trial, Wimpole Estate expressed their intention to use the battery-powered prototype during the growing season.

In November 2020 there was a break-in at Wimpole Hall and twelve items, including vases and busts, were stolen.

<text>Sugama Sangeetha, a variety of Bhavageethe, is an Indian musical genre in which poetry in the Kannada language is set to music. It gained recognition with the work of P. Kalinga Rao in the mid -20th century. Mysore Ananthaswamy and C. Aswath developed the form further in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Origin and development==
It is unclear when exactly Bhavageethe started but in 1920s and 30s there were many attempts to set tunes to poetry. By the 1950s it started taking a more defined shape and a highly talented musicianP. Kalinga Rao was instrumental in spreading this art form. He set tunes to the poems of many famous Navodaya poets, and gave performances on All India Radio as well as public gatherings. The art form started gaining popularity through his rendering of &quot;Udayavaagali Namma Cheluvu Kannada Naadu&quot;, &quot;Yaaru Hitavaru Ninage&quot;, &quot;Anathadim Digantadim&quot;, &quot;Baarayya Beladingale&quot;, &quot;Brahma Ninge Jodistheeni&quot; etc., He laid the foundation of Sugama Sangeetha and hence is considered to be the father of this form.

The 60s and 70s saw many emerging musicians contributing to this field. H.R.Leelavathi, Padmacharan, H. K. Narayana in South Karnataka and Balappa Hukkeri in North Karnataka played a significant role in popularising the art across Karnataka. They also contributed to the field through their own compositions.

The next major personality in the field was Mysore Ananthaswamy. Till then, though there were a lot of compositions, they remained as more or less a subset of classical music from the musical perspective. It was Ananthaswamy who could think out of the box. He not only crossed the barrier of classical music, but was instrumental in adding its own subtleties to Bhaavageethe. With instrumentation also taking different shape by that time, he introduced a number of changes to orchestration. By that time, Bhavageethe was quite popular and businessmen began to publish it in cassette form. With that, &#x27;Nithyotsava&#x27; became the first Bhavageethe album to be released. There were a lot of popular albums to his credit. &#x27;Nithyotsava&#x27;, &#x27;Bhava Sangama&#x27;, &#x27;Minchu&#x27;, &#x27;Rathnana Padagalu&#x27; to mention a few.

Another young and dynamic talent emerged in the 70s: C. Aswath. Highly talented and a great visionary, his way of blending the lyrical and musical dynamics was hard to match. His way of rendering a song, with emphasis on lyrical dynamics and word power was distinctive. He also brought about a number of changes to the art. Dramatic elements, virtual picturization and other innovations could be observed in abundance in his compositions. He was instrumental in making Shishunala Sharif&#x27;s poems popular across Karnataka. His popular albums are &#x27;Mysooru Mallige&#x27;, &#x27;Shishunala Sharif Sahebara Geethegalu&#x27;, &#x27;Chaitra&#x27;, &#x27;Kannadave Satya&#x27; etc.,

P.Kalinga Rao, Mysore Ananthaswamy and C.Aswath are considered to be the trinity of Sugama Sangeetha. The mid 70s to mid 90s were probably the golden age since, in this period, the major exponents Ananthaswamy and Aswath were at the peak of their careers. The art form had matured enough to be considered an independent genre, and it started adding its own theories through experiments, while commercialisation due to increasing popularity and subsequent dilution of the art had not yet started.

==Notable contributors==
Many musicians have been successful in popularising Sugama Sangeetha through their compositions or singing, including:

===Composers===
P.Kalinga Rao, Mysore Ananthaswamy, C.Aswath, H. K. Narayana, Padmacharan, H.R.Leelavathi, Baalappa Hukkeri, Madikeri Nagendra, Raju Ananthaswamy, N.S.Prasad, B.K.Chandrashekar, B.V.Srinivas, Sunitha Ananthaswamy, Jayashree Arvind, Praveen D Rao, Pravin Godkhindi, M.D.Pallavi, Archana Udupa, Chidambara Kalamanji, Mahesh Mahadev, Upasana Mohan, Vasantha Kanakapur, Gartikere Raganna, Manjula Gururaj, Shamala Jagirdhar.

===Singers===
P. Kalinga Rao, Mysore Ananthaswamy, C.Aswath, Baalappa Hukkerimy, Bhimsen Joshi, Sulochana, Madikeri Nagendra, Rathnamala Prakash, Manjula Gururaj, M.K.Jayashree, H. K. Narayana, Shimoga Subbanna, Smt. Shamala Jagirdar, B. K. Sumitra, Kasturi Shankar, Raju Ananthaswamy, B.R.

===Instrumentalists===
N.S.Prasad (Mandolin), Praveen Duth Stephen (Keyboard), Saadhu Kokila (Keyboard), Shabbir Ahmed (Keyboard), Krishna Udupa (Keyboard), Bali (Rhythmic Instruments), Venugopal Raju (Tabla), Praveen D Rao (Tabla and Harmonium), Srinivas Achar (Classical and 12 string Guitar), Arun Kumar (Rhythmic Instruments), Pramath Kiran (Rhythmic Instruments), N.S.Murali (Flute), Pravin Godkhindi (Flute), B.K.Chandrashekar (Violin)

==Current situation and future of Sugama Sangeetha==
Post Ananthaswamy and Aswath era (2000s), there are very few notable and dedicated contributors to the field. Though there were some exceptions like &#x27;Kannadave Satya&#x27; event, Sugama Sangeetha could not get a wide base of audience. Another reason could be, the dip in standard of Kannada poetry at the same time. Even today, a full-fledged Sugama Sangeetha concert without the compositions of Kalinga Rao, Mysore Ananthaswamy and C.Aswath is hard to imagine.

Karnataka Sugama Sangeetha Pariashath&#x27;s 11th annual Sugama Sangeeth conference &quot;Geethotsava – 2014&quot; took place on 7–9 February on National College ground, Basavanagudi, Bangalore.

<text>Kathu is a town in South Africa, and the iron ore capital of the Northern Cape province. Its name means &quot;town under the trees&quot;, after the Camel Thorn forest it is situated in. The phrase &quot;the town under the trees&quot; was coined by an engineer working in the town in the early-1990s as part of a tourist marketing drive, together with the accompanying graphic. It was intended to be a marketing slogan. The meaning of the word &quot;Kathu&quot; has anecdotically been attributed to a porridge brewed by the local population from the powder found in the pods of the Camel Thorn trees.

Kathu was founded in the late-1960s or early-1970s.

Kathu is situated between Upington and Vryburg with about a 2-hour drive to each. Kimberley is a 3-hour drive away, while Kuruman is only 20 minutes away.

==Camel thorn tree forest==
The Camel Thorn tree Acacia erioloba forest is one of only two in the world with the other being between Mariental and Rehoboth in Namibia. Its unique nature was recognized in the early-1920s when it was declared a State Forest. In 1995 it was registered as a Natural Heritage Site. The Kathu Forest is approximately 4000 hectares in size and these Camel thorns trees provide support for large Sociable Weaver’s nests and are used by many other bird and animal species. In fact surveys has shown a moderate to high diversity in animal and plant species, including several Red Data, endemic and protected species in and around the forest. Bigger trees in the forest are reckoned to be older than 300 years.

==Mining==
The town and the accompanying industrial area of Sishen came into being because of iron ore mining activity in the Kalahari — it has one of the five largest open-cast iron ore mining operations in the world. The primary drilling and &#x27;load and haul&#x27; mining equipment used by the mine include giant ore trucks that bear about 260 ton of ore with each load. Mining shovels used to load these trucks can weigh in excess of 800 tons and drilling equipment include drills that can drill up to 400 mm holes for blasting purposes. Some of the world&#x27;s longest ore trains travel through harsh territory on the Sishen-Saldanha railway to offload their cargo at Saldanha Bay. Kumba Iron Ore is the principal mine operator in Kathu.

==Recreation==
Kathu has a golf course and a small, well-stocked game reserve also adjoins the town.

The town has a well established sporting complex including tennis courts, swimming pool and a golf course. One of the tennis courts is named after veteran tennis player Herta Hegewisch.

==Kathu Archaeological Site Complex==
Significant Stone Age sites occur in and around Kathu and on adjacent farms. These are subject to on-going archaeological research.

The importance of the Kathu Pan site was highlighted in the November 16, 2012 issue of the journal &quot;Science&quot; in which Jayne Wilkins and colleagues reveal evidence of 500 000 year-old stone points (excavated by Peter Beaumont in 1979-1982), argued to be the earliest stone-tipped spears yet found. This conclusion, based partly on study of use wear, is taken to indicate that human ancestors used stone-tipped weapons for hunting 200 000 years earlier than previously thought. Wilkins is quoted as saying that the find does more than simply extend the prehistory of stone-tipped spears – it puts those first spears firmly in the hands of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;. &quot;Modern foragers use such tools to take down large game as part of cooperative, strategic hunts. Perhaps our ancestor did so too.&quot;

Kathu Townlands, one of the richest early prehistoric archaeological sites at Kathu, has produced tens of thousands of Earlier Stone Age artifacts, including hand axes and other tools and estimated to be between 700,000 and one million years old. It is situated between the Kuruman Hills to the east and the Langberge mountains to the west. These discovery was made in 2013 by archaeologists from the University of Cape Town and the University of Toronto, in collaboration with the McGregor Museum.

<text>Animal euthanasia (euthanasia from ; &quot;good death&quot;) is the act of killing an animal humanely, most commonly with injectable drugs. Reasons for euthanasia include incurable (and especially painful) conditions or diseases, lack of resources to continue supporting the animal, or laboratory test procedures. Euthanasia methods are designed to cause minimal pain and distress. Euthanasia is distinct from animal slaughter and pest control.

In domesticated animals, the discussion of animal euthanasia may be substituted with euphemisms, such as &quot;put down&quot; or &quot;put to sleep&quot; to make the wording less harsh.

== Methods ==
The methods of euthanasia can be divided into pharmacological and physical methods. Acceptable pharmacological methods include injected drugs and gases that first depress the central nervous system and then cardiovascular activity. Acceptable physical methods must first cause rapid loss of consciousness by disrupting the central nervous system. The most common methods are discussed here, but there are other acceptable methods used in different situations.

=== Intravenous anesthetic ===

Upon administration of intravenous anesthetic, unconsciousness, respiratory then cardiac arrest follow rapidly, usually within 30 seconds.

The two-stage process that some veterinarians use includes a first shot that is a sedative to make the animal more comfortable and then a second shot that euthanizes the animal. This allows the owner the chance to say goodbye to a live pet without their emotions stressing the animal. It also greatly mitigates any tendency toward spasm and other involuntary movement which tends to increase the emotional upset that the pet&#x27;s owner experiences.

For large animals, the volumes of barbiturates required are considered by some to be impractical, although this is standard practice in the United States. For horses and cattle, other drugs may be available. Some specially formulated combination products are available, such as Somulose (secobarbital/cinchocaine) and Tributame (embutramide/chloroquine/lidocaine), which cause deep unconsciousness and cardiac arrest independently with a lower volume of injection, thus making the process faster, safer, and more effective.

Occasionally, a horse injected with these mixtures may display apparent seizure activity before death. This may be due to premature cardiac arrest. However, if normal precautions (e.g., sedation with detomidine) are taken, this is rarely a problem. Anecdotal reports that long-term use of phenylbutazone increases the risk of this reaction are unverified.

After the animal has died, it is not uncommon for the body to have posthumous body jerks or a sudden bladder or bowel outburst. This is caused by the muscles of the deceased animal&#x27;s body relaxing.

=== Inhalants ===

Gas anesthetics such as isoflurane and sevoflurane can be used for euthanasia of very small animals. The animals are placed in sealed chambers where high levels of anesthetic gas are introduced. Death may also be caused using carbon dioxide once unconsciousness has been achieved by inhaled anesthetic. Carbon dioxide is often used on its own for euthanasia of wild animals. There are mixed opinions on whether it causes distress when used on its own, with human experiments lending support to the evidence that it can cause distress and equivocal results in non-humans. In 2013, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) issued new guidelines for carbon dioxide induction, stating that a flow rate of 10% to 30% volume/min is optimal for the humane euthanasia of small rodents.

Carbon monoxide is often used, but some states in the US have banned its use in animal shelters: although carbon monoxide poisoning is not particularly painful, the conditions in the gas chamber are often not humane. Nitrogen has been shown to be effective, although some young animals are more resistant to the effects, and it currently is not widely used.

The use of gas chambers is not the most humane form of euthanasia as it can take up to 20 minutes to fully euthanize the animal. If the chambers are not calibrated correctly or the animal is ill, the process is only delayed further which can cause more harm to the animal.

=== Cervical dislocation ===
Cervical dislocation, or displacement (breaking or fracturing) of the neck, is an older and less common method of killing small animals such as mice. Performed properly it is intended to cause as painless a death as possible and has no cost or equipment involved. The handler must know the proper method of executing the movement which will cause the cervical displacement and without proper training and method education there is a risk of not causing death and can cause severe pain and suffering. It is unknown how long an animal remains conscious, or the level of suffering it goes through after a correct snapping of the neck, which is why it has become less common and often substituted with inhalants.

=== Intracardiac or intraperitoneal injection ===
When intravenous injection is not possible, euthanasia drugs such as pentobarbital can be injected directly into a heart chamber or body cavity. With regard to state and federal laws, one of the most humane forms of euthanizing animals is through the injection Sodium Pentobarbital. This is typically the second shot that is followed after a sedative when euthanizing animals.

While intraperitoneal injection is fully acceptable (although it may take up to 15 minutes to take effect in dogs and cats), an intracardiac (IC) injection may only be performed on an unconscious or deeply sedated animal. Performing IC injections on a fully conscious animal in places with humane laws for animal handling is often a criminal offense.

=== Shooting ===

This can be a means of euthanasia for large animals—such as horses, cattle, and deer—if performed properly.
This may be performed by means of:

; Firearms: Traditionally used in the field for euthanizing horses, deer or other large game animals. The animal is shot in the forehead with the bullet directed down the spine through the medulla oblongata, resulting in instant death. The risks are minimal if carried out by skilled personnel in a suitable location.

; Captive bolt gun: Commonly used by the meat packing industry to slaughter cattle and other livestock. The bolt is fired through the forehead causing massive disruption of the cerebral cortex. In cattle, this stuns the animal, though if left for a prolonged period it will die from cerebral oedema. Death should therefore be rapidly brought about by pithing or exsanguination. Horses are killed outright by the captive bolt, making pithing and exsanguination unnecessary.

== Reasons ==
The reasons for euthanasia of pets and other animals include:

* Terminal illness, e.g. cancer or rabies
* Illness or accident that is not terminal but would cause suffering for the animal to live with, or when the owner cannot afford the treatment or has a moral objection to the treatment
* Old age and deterioration leading to loss of major bodily functions, resulting in severe impairment of the quality of life.
* Dementia in pets leading to loss of cognitive function and normal daily behaviour and interactions with owner. Dementia resulting in unsocial and repetitive behaviour causing prolonged stress for both pets and their owners.
* A hunter&#x27;s coup de grâce
* Behavioural problems (usually ones that cannot be corrected) e.g. aggression – Canines that have usually caused grievous bodily harm (severe injuries or death) to either humans or other animals through mauling are usually seized and euthanised (&#x27;destroyed&#x27; in British legal terms)
* Lack of home or caretaker or resources for feeding
* &quot;Convenience euthanasia&quot;, if the owner no longer wants to care for the pet
* Research and testing – In the course of scientific research or testing, animals may be euthanized in order to be dissected, to prevent suffering after testing, to prevent the spread of disease, or other reasons

Small animal euthanasia is typically performed in a veterinary clinic or hospital, at animal shelter, or at the pet owner&#x27;s home and is usually carried out by a veterinarian or a veterinary technician working under the veterinarian&#x27;s supervision. Often animal shelter workers are trained to perform euthanasia as well. Knowing when it&#x27;s time to put a pet down can be difficult. A licensed veterinarian can help an owner determine when in the course of an illness or behavioral problem euthanasia is appropriate.

In the case of large animals which have sustained injuries, this will also occur at the site of the accident, for example, on a racecourse.

Some animal rights organizations support animal euthanasia in certain circumstances and practice euthanasia at shelters that they operate.

== Legal status ==

In the U.S., for companion animals euthanized in animal shelters, most states prescribe intravenous injection as the required method. These laws date to 1990, when Georgia&#x27;s Humane Euthanasia Act became the first state law to mandate this method. Before that, gas chambers and other means were commonly employed. The Georgia law was resisted by the Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture, Tommy Irvin, who was charged with enforcing the act. In March 2007, he was sued by former State Representative Chesley V. Morton, who wrote the law, and subsequently ordered by the court to enforce all provisions of the Act.

Some states allow the use of carbon monoxide chambers for euthanasia.

In the Philippines, the treatment and handling of stray dogs are governed by specific laws that emphasize animal welfare. The primary law is Republic Act No. 8485, also known as the &quot;Animal Welfare Act of 1998,&quot; as amended by Republic Act No. 10631 in 2013. This law outlines the responsibilities of local government units (LGUs) and veterinarians in dealing with stray animals.

== Remains ==
Many pet owners choose to have their pets cremated or buried after the pet is euthanized, and there are pet funeral homes that specialize in animal burial or cremation. Otherwise, the animal facility will often freeze the body and subsequently send it to the local landfill.

In some instances, animals euthanized at shelters or animal control agencies have been sent to meat rendering facilities to be processed for use in cosmetics, fertilizer, gelatin, poultry feed, pharmaceuticals and pet food. It was proposed that the presence of pentobarbital in dog food may have caused dogs to become less responsive to the drug when being euthanized. However, a 2002 FDA study found no dog or cat DNA in the foods they tested, so it was theorized that the drug found in dog food came from euthanized cattle and horses. Furthermore, the level of the drug found in pet food was safe.

<doc id="631310" wikidata="Q1089123" url="?curid=631310" title="Mark (unit)">
<text>The Mark (from Middle High German: Marc, march, brand) is originally a medieval weight or mass unit, which supplanted the pound weight as a precious metals and coinage weight in parts of Europe in the 11th century. The Mark is traditionally divided into 8 ounces or 16 lots. The Cologne mark corresponded to about 234 grams.

Like the German systems, the French poids de marc weight system considered one &quot;Marc&quot; equal to 8 troy ounces.

Just as the pound of 12 troy ounces (373 g) lent its name to the pound unit of currency, the mark lent its name to the mark unit of currency.

== Origin of the term ==
The Etymological Dictionary of the German Language by Friedrich Kluge derives the word from the Proto-Germanic term &quot;marka&quot;, &quot;weight and value unit&quot; (originally &quot;division, shared&quot;).

The etymological dictionary by Wolfgang Pfeifer sees the Old High German &quot;marc&quot;, &quot;delimitation, sign&quot;, as the stem and assumes that &quot;marc&quot; originally meant &quot;minting&quot; (marking of a certain weight), later denoting the ingot itself and its weight, and finally a coin of a certain weight and value.

According to an 1848 trade lexicon, the term &quot;Gewichtsmark&quot; comes from the fact that &quot;the piece of metal used for weighing was stamped with a sign or symbol&quot;. Meyer&#x27;s 1905 Konversationslexikon similarly derives the origin of the word to the emergence of the mark from the Roman pound of to 11 ounces. Charlemagne, as King of the Franks, carried out a monetary and measures reform towards the end of the 8th century. In particular, he had introduced the &quot;Karlspfund&quot; (&quot;Charles pound&quot;) as the basic unit of coinage and trade which, however, weighed only 8 ounces. In order to prevent a further reduction in the weight of a pound, a sign, the &quot;mark&quot;, was now stamped on the new weights. The actual weight of these weights, known as &quot;marca&quot;, is said to have fluctuated between 196 g and 280 g.

<text>Eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by the enzymatic or non-enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid or other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that are, similar to arachidonic acid, around 20 carbon units in length. Eicosanoids are a sub-category of oxylipins, i.e. oxidized fatty acids of diverse carbon units in length, and are distinguished from other oxylipins by their overwhelming importance as cell signaling molecules. Eicosanoids function in diverse physiological systems and pathological processes such as: mounting or inhibiting inflammation, allergy, fever and other immune responses; regulating the abortion of pregnancy and normal childbirth; contributing to the perception of pain; regulating cell growth; controlling blood pressure; and modulating the regional flow of blood to tissues. In performing these roles, eicosanoids most often act as autocrine signaling agents to impact their cells of origin or as paracrine signaling agents to impact cells in the proximity of their cells of origin. Some eicosanoids, such as prostaglandins, may also have endocrine roles as hormones to influence the function of distant cells.

There are multiple subfamilies of eicosanoids, including most prominently the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, lipoxins, resolvins, and eoxins. For each subfamily, there is the potential to have at least 4 separate series of metabolites, two series derived from the ω−6 PUFAs arachidonic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acids, one series derived from the ω−3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid, and one series derived from the ω−9 PUFA mead acid. This subfamily distinction is important. Mammals, including humans, are unable to convert ω−6 into ω−3 PUFA. In consequence, tissue levels of the ω−6 and ω−3 PUFAs and their corresponding eicosanoid metabolites link directly to the amount of dietary ω−6 versus ω−3 PUFAs consumed. Since certain of the ω−6 and ω−3 PUFA series of metabolites have almost diametrically opposing physiological and pathological activities, it has often been suggested that the deleterious consequences associated with the consumption of ω−6 PUFA-rich diets reflects excessive production and activities of ω−6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids, while the beneficial effects associated with the consumption of ω−3 PUFA-rich diets reflect the excessive production and activities of ω−3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids. In this view, the opposing effects of ω−6 PUFA-derived and ω−3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids on key target cells underlie the detrimental and beneficial effects of ω−6 and ω−3 PUFA-rich diets on inflammation and allergy reactions, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cancer growth, and a host of other processes.

==Nomenclature==
===Fatty acid sources===
&quot;Eicosanoid&quot; () is the collective term for straight-chain PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids) of 20 carbon units in length that have been metabolized or otherwise converted to oxygen-containing products. The PUFA precursors to the eicosanoids include:
* Arachidonic acid (AA), i.e. 5&quot;Z&quot;,8&quot;Z&quot;,11&quot;Z&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatetraenoic acid is an ω−6 fatty acid with four double bonds in the &quot;cis&quot; configuration (denoted &quot;Z&quot; in E–Z notation), each located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15 (see carbon numbering).
* Adrenic acid (AdA), i.e. 7&quot;Z&quot;,10&quot;Z&quot;,13&quot;Z&quot;,16&quot;Z&quot;-docosatetraenoic acid, is an ω−6 fatty acid with four &quot;cis&quot; double bonds, each located between carbons 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, and 16-17.
* Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), i.e. 5&quot;Z&quot;,8&quot;Z&quot;,11&quot;Z&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;,17&quot;Z&quot;-eicosapentaenoic acid is an ω−3 fatty acid with five &quot;cis&quot; double bonds, each located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, 14-15, and 17-18.
* Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), i.e. 8&quot;Z&quot;,11&quot;Z&quot;,14&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatrienoic acid is an ω−6 fatty acid with three &quot;cis&quot; double bonds, each located between carbons 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15.
* Mead acid, i.e. 5&quot;Z&quot;,8&quot;Z&quot;,11&quot;Z&quot;-eicosatrienoic acid, is an ω−9 fatty acid containing three &quot;cis&quot; double bonds, each located between carbons 5-6, 8-9, and 11-12.

===Abbreviation===
A particular eicosanoid is denoted by a four-character abbreviation, composed of:
*its two-letter abbreviation (LT, EX or PG, as described below),
*one A-B-C sequence-letter,
*A subscript or plain script number following the designated eicosanoid&#x27;s trivial name indicates the number of its double bonds. Examples are:
** The EPA-derived prostanoids have three double bonds (e.g. PGG3 or PGG3) while leukotrienes derived from EPA have five double bonds (e.g. LTB5 or LTB5).
**The AA-derived prostanoids have two double bonds (e.g. PGG2 or PGG2) while their AA-derived leukotrienes have four double bonds (e.g. LTB4 or LTB4). 
* Hydroperoxy-, hydroxyl-, and oxo-eicosanoids possess a hydroperoxy (-OOH), hydroxy (-OH), or oxygen atom (=O) substituents link to a PUFA carbon by a single (-) or double (=) bond. Their trivial names indicate the substituent as: Hp or HP for a hydroperoxy residue (e.g. 5-hydroperooxy-eicosatraenoic acid or 5-HpETE or 5-HPETE); H for a hydroxy residue (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid or 5-HETE); and oxo- for an oxo residue (e.g. 5-oxo-eicosatetraenioic acid or 5-oxo-ETE or 5-oxoETE). The number of their double bonds is indicated by their full and trivial names: AA-derived hydroxy metabolites have four (i.e. &#x27;tetra&#x27; or &#x27;T&#x27;) double bonds (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid or 5-HETE; EPA-derived hydroxy metabolites have five (&#x27;penta&#x27; or &#x27;P&#x27;) double bonds (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid or 5-HEPE); and DGLA-derived hydroxy metabolites have three (&#x27;tri&#x27; or &#x27;Tr&#x27;) double bonds (e.g. 5-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid or 5-HETrE).

The stereochemistry of the eicosanoid products formed may differ among the pathways. For prostaglandins, this is often indicated by Greek letters (e.g. PGF2α versus PGF2β). For hydroperoxy and hydroxy eicosanoids an &quot;S&quot; or &quot;R&quot; designates the chirality of their substituents (e.g. 5&quot;S&quot;-hydroxy-eicosateteraenoic acid [also termed 5(&quot;S&quot;)-, 5S-hydroxy-, and 5(S)-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid] is given the trivial names of 5&quot;S&quot;-HETE, 5(&quot;S&quot;)-HETE, 5S-HETE, or 5(S)-HETE). Since eicosanoid-forming enzymes commonly make &quot;S&quot; isomer products either with marked preference or essentially exclusively, the use of &quot;S&quot;/&quot;R&quot; designations has often been dropped (e.g. 5&quot;S&quot;-HETE is 5-HETE). Nonetheless, certain eicosanoid-forming pathways do form R isomers and their &quot;S&quot; versus &quot;R&quot; isomeric products can exhibit dramatically different biological activities. Failing to specify &quot;S&quot;/&quot;R&quot; isomers can be misleading. Here, all hydroperoxy and hydroxy substituents have the &quot;S&quot; configuration unless noted otherwise.

===Classic eicosanoids===
Current usage limits the term eicosanoid to:
*ω−6 series eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid:
**Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE) include the following metabolites of arachidonic acid:
***5-HETE, 12-HETE, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 15-HETE), 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 20-HETE), and 19-HETE.
**Leukotrienes (LT) include the following metabolites of arachidonic acid:
***LTA4, LTB44, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4.
**Eoxins (EX) include the following metabolites of arachidnoic acid:
***EXA4, EXC4, EXD4, and EXE4.
**Prostanoids consisting of several different types: 
***Prostaglandins (PG) include the following metabolites of arachidonic acid:
****PGG2, PGH2, PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, PGA2, PGB2 (see ).
***Prostacyclins include:

*ω−6 series eicosanoids derived from dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid. These metabolites are analogs of arachidonic acid-derived eicosanoids but lack a double bond between carbons 5 and 6 and therefore have 1 less double bond than their arachidonic acid-derived analogs. They are the following:
**PGA1, PGE1, and TXA1.
*ω−3 series eicosanoids:
**Resolvins of the E series (RvE) (D series resolvins [RvD] are metabolites of the 22-carbon ω−3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid; see ). RvE include the following metabolites of eicosapentaenoic acid:
***RvE1, 18S-RvE1, RvE2, and RvE3.
**Other ω−3 series eicosapentaenoic acid-derived eicosanoids are analogs of ω−6 fatty acid-derived metabolites but contain a double bond between carbon 17 and 18 and therefore have one more double bond than their arachidonic acid-derived analogs. They include (HEPE is hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid):
***5-HEPE, 12-HEPE, 15-HEPE, and 20-HETE; LTA5, LTB5, LTC5, LTD5, and LTE5 (see ); PGE3, PGD3, PGF3α, and Δ(17)-6-keto PGF1α; PGI3 (see ); and TXA3 and TXB3.
*ω−9 series eicosanoids
**Hydroxy are derived form mead acid, is metabolized to the 3 double bond-containing analog of 5-HETE viz., 5-HETrE (see ).
Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, leukotrienes, eoxins and prostanoids are sometimes termed &quot;classic eicosanoids&quot;.

===Nonclassic eicosanoids===
In contrast to the classic eicosanoids, several other classes of PUFA metabolites have been termed &#x27;novel&#x27;, &#x27;eicosanoid-like&#x27; or &#x27;nonclassic eicosanoids&#x27;. These included the following classes:
*Oxoeicosanoids (oxo-ETE) include the following metabolites:
**5-Oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), 12-oxo-ETE (see ), and 15-oxo-ETE, which are metabolites of arachidonic acid (see 15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 5-oxo-ETrE which is a metabolite of mead acid (see ).
*Hepoxilins (Hx) include the following arachidonic acid metabolites:
** HxA3 and HxB3.
*Lipoxins (Lx) include the following metabolites of arachidonic acid:
** LxA4 and LxB4 (see Specialized pro-resolving mediators). 
*Epi-lipoxins (epi-Lx) include the following metabolites of arachidonic acid:
** 15-epi-LxA4 (also termed AT-LxA4) and 15-epi-LxB4 (also termed AT-LxB4).
*Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) include the following metabolites of arachidonic acid:
**5,6-EET, 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET.
*Epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQ) include the following metabolites of eicosapentaenoic acid:
**5,6-EEQ, 8,9-EEQ, 11,12-EEQ, 14,15-EEQ, and 15,16-EEQ.
*Isoprostanes (isoP) are non-enzymatically formed derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids studied as markers of oxidative stress; they include the following arachidonic acid-derived isoPs which are named based on their structural similarities to PGs:
**D2-isoPs, E2-isoPs, A2-isoPs, and J2-isoPs; and two epoxide-containing isoPs, 5,6-epoxyisoprostane E2 and 5,6-epoxyisoprostane A2. Some of these isoPs have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory activity (see ). 
*Isofurans are non-enzymatically formed derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids that possess a furan ring structure; they are studied as markers of oxidative stress. There are 256 potentially different furan ring-containing isomers that can be derived from arachidonic acid.
*Endocannabinoids are certain glycerolipids or dopamine that are esterified to polyunsaturated fatty acids that activate cannabinoid receptors. They include the following arachidonic acid-esterified agents:
**Arachidonoylethanolamine, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-arachidonyl glyceryl ether, &quot;O&quot;-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine, and &quot;N&quot;-arachidonoyl dopamine.

Metabolism of eicosapentaenoic acid to HEPEs, leukotrienes, prostanoids, and epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids as well as the metabolism of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid to prostanoids and mead acid to 5(S)-hydroxy-6E,8Z,11Z-eicosatrienoic acid (5-HETrE), 5-oxo-6,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-ETrE), LTA3, and LTC3 involve the same enzymatic pathways that make their arachidonic acid-derived analogs.

==Biosynthesis==
Eicosanoids typically are not stored within cells but rather synthesized as required. They derive from the fatty acids that make up the cell membrane and nuclear membrane. These fatty acids must be released from their membrane sites and then metabolized initially to products which most often are further metabolized through various pathways to make the large array of products we recognize as bioactive eicosanoids.

===Fatty acid mobilization===
Eicosanoid biosynthesis begins when a cell is activated by mechanical trauma, ischemia, other physical perturbations, attack by pathogens, or stimuli made by nearby cells, tissues, or pathogens such as chemotactic factors, cytokines, growth factors, and even certain eicosanoids. The activated cells then mobilize enzymes, termed phospholipases A2 (PLA2), capable of releasing ω−6 and ω−3 fatty acids from membrane storage. These fatty acids are bound in ester linkage to the SN2 position of membrane phospholipids; PLA2 act as esterases to release the fatty acid. There are several classes of PLA2 with type IV cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) appearing to be responsible for releasing the fatty acids under many conditions of cell activation. The cPLA2 act specifically on phospholipids that contain AA, EPA or GPLA at their SN2 position. cPLA2 may also release the lysophospholipid that becomes platelet-activating factor.

===Peroxidation and reactive oxygen species===
Next, the free fatty acid is oxygenated along any of several pathways; see the &quot;Pathways&quot; table. The eicosanoid pathways (&quot;via&quot; lipoxygenase or COX) add molecular oxygen (O2). Although the fatty acid is symmetric, the resulting eicosanoids are chiral; the oxidations proceed with high stereoselectivity (enzymatic oxidations are considered practically stereospecific).

Four families of enzymes initiate or contribute to the initiation of the catalysis of fatty acids to eicosanoids:
*Cyclooxygenases (COXs): COX-1 and COX-2 initiate the metabolism of arachidonic acid to prostanoids that contain two double bonds, i.e. the prostaglandins (e.g. PGE2), prostacyclins (i.e. PGI2), and thromboxanes (e.g. TXA2). The two COX enzymes likewise initiate the metabolism of: a) Eicosapentaenoic acid, which has 5 double bonds compared to the 4 double bonds of arachidonic acid, to prostanoid, prostacyclin, and thromboxane products that have three double bonds, e.g. PGE3, PGI3, and TXA3 and b) Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, which has three double bonds, to prostanoid, prostacyclin, and thromboxane products that have only one double bond, e.g. PGE1, PGI1, and TXA1. 
*Lipoxygenases (LOXs): 5-Lipoxygenase (5-LOX or ALOX5) initiates the metabolism of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HpETE) which then may be rapidly reduced to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) or further metabolized to the leukotrienes (e.g. LTB4 and LTC4); 5-HETE may be oxidized to 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE). In similar fashions, 15-lipoxygenase (15-lipoxygenase 1, 15-LOX, 15-LOX1, or ALOX15) initiates the metabolism of arachidonic acid to 15-HpETE, 15-HETE, eoxins, 8,15-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 8,15-DiHETE), and 15-oxo-ETE and 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX or ALOX12) initiates the metabolism of arachidonic acid to 12-HpETE, 12-HETE, hepoxilins, and 12-oxo-ETE. These enzymes also initiate the metabolism of; a) Eicosapentaenoic acid to analogs of the arachidonic acid metabolites that contain 5 rather than four double bonds, e.g. 5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (5-HEPE), LTB5, LTC5, 5-oxo-EPE, 15-HEPE, and 12-HEPE; b) The three double bond-containing dihomo-γ-linolenic acid to products that contain 3 double bonds, e.g. 8-hydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (8-HETrE), 12-HETrE, and 15-HETrE (this fatty acid cannot be converted to leukotrienes); and the three double bond-containing mead acid (by ALOX5) to 5-hydroperoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5-HpETrE), 5-HETrE, and 5-oxo-HETrE. In the most studied of these pathways, ALOX5 metabolizes eicosapentaenoic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid (5-HpEPE), 5-HEPE, and LTB5, and 5-oxo-EPE, all of which are less active than there arachidonic acid analogs. Since eicosapentaenoic acid competes with arachidonic acid for ALOX5, production of the eicosapentaenoate metabolites leads to a reduction in the eicosatetraenoate metabolites and therefore reduction in the latter metabolites&#x27; signaling. The initial mono-hydroperoxy and mono-hydroxy products made by the aforementioned lipoxygenases have their hydroperosy and hydroxyl residues positioned in the &quot;S&quot; chiral configuration and are more properly termed 5&quot;S&quot;-HpETE, 5&quot;S&quot;-HETE, 12&quot;S&quot;-HpETE, 12&quot;S&quot;-HETE, 15&quot;S&quot;-HpETE and, 15&quot;S&quot;-HETE. ALOX12B (i.e. arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type) forms &quot;R&quot; chirality products, i.e. 12&quot;R&quot;-HpETE and 12&quot;R&quot;-HETE. Similarly, ALOXE3 (i.e. epidermis-type lipoxygenase 3 or eLOX3) metabolizes arachidonic acid to 12&quot;R&quot;-HpETE and 12&quot;R&quot;-HETE; however these are minor products that this enzyme forms only under a limited set of conditions. ALOXE3 preferentially metabolizes arachidonic acid to hepoxilins. 
*Epoxygenases: these are cytochrome P450 enzymes which generate nonclassic eicosanoid epoxides derived from: a) Arachidonic acid viz., 5,6-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5,6-EET), 8,9-EET, 11,12-EET, and 14,15-EET (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid); b) Eicosapentaenoic acid viz., 5,6,-epoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,6-EEQ), 8,9-EEQ, 11,12-EEQ, 14,15-EEQ, and 17,18-EEQ (see Epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid); c) Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid viz., 8,9-epoxy-eicosadienoic acid (8,9-EpEDE), 11,12-EpEDE, and 14,15-EpEDE; and d) Adrenic acid viz., 7,8-epox-eicosatrienoic acid (7,8-EpETrR), 10,11-EpTrE, 13,14-EpTrE, and 16,17-EpETrE. All of these epoxides are converted, sometimes rapidly, to their dihydroxy metabolites, by various cells and tissues. For example, 5,6-EET is converted to 5,6-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (5,6-DiHETrE), 8,9-EEQ to 8,9-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (8,9-DiHETE, 11,12-EpEDE to 11,12-dihydroxy-eicosadienoic acid (11,12DiHEDE), and 16,17-EpETrE to 16,17-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (16,17-DiETrE.
*Cytochrome P450 microsome ω hydroxylases: CYP4A11, CYP4A22, CYP4F2, and CYP4F3 metabolize arachidonic acid primarily to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) but also to 16-HETE, 17-HETE, 18-HETE, and 19-HETE; they also metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid primarily to 20-hydroxy-eicosapentaenoic acid (20-HEPE) but also to 19-HEPE.

Two different enzymes may act in series on a PUFA to form more complex metabolites. For example, ALOX5 acts with ALOX12 or aspirin-treated COX-2 to metabolize arachidonic acid to lipoxins and with cytochrome P450 monooxygenase(s), bacterial cytochrome P450 (in infected tissues), or aspirin-treated COX2 to metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid to the E series resolvins (RvEs) (see Specialized pro-resolving mediators). When this occurs with enzymes located in different cell types and involves the transfer of one enzyme&#x27;s product to a cell which uses the second enzyme to make the final product it is referred to as transcellular metabolism or transcellular biosynthesis.

The oxidation of lipids is hazardous to cells, particularly when close to the nucleus.
There are elaborate mechanisms to prevent unwanted oxidation. COX, the lipoxygenases, and the phospholipases are tightly controlled—there are at least eight proteins activated to coordinate generation of leukotrienes. Several of these exist in multiple isoforms.

Oxidation by either COX or lipoxygenase releases reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the initial products in eicosanoid generation are themselves highly reactive peroxides. LTA4 can form adducts with tissue DNA. Other reactions of lipoxygenases generate cellular damage; murine models implicate 15-lipoxygenase in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
The oxidation in eicosanoid generation is compartmentalized; this limits the peroxides&#x27; damage.
The enzymes that are biosynthetic for eicosanoids (e.g., glutathione-S-transferases, epoxide hydrolases, and carrier proteins) belong to families whose functions are involved largely with cellular detoxification.
This suggests that eicosanoid signaling might have evolved from the detoxification of ROS.

The cell must realize some benefit from generating lipid hydroperoxides close-by its nucleus.
PGs and LTs may signal or regulate DNA transcription there;
LTB4 is ligand for PPARα.

=== Prostanoid pathways ===

Both COX1 and COX2 (also termed prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-1 (PTGS1) and PTGS2, respectively) metabolize arachidonic acid by adding molecular O2 between carbons 9 and 11 to form an endoperoxide bridge between these two carbons, adding molecular O2 to carbon 15 to yield a 15-hydroperoxy product, creating a carbon-carbon bond between carbons 8 and 12 to create a cyclopentane ring in the middle of the fatty acid, and in the process making PGG2, a product that has two fewer double bonds than arachidonic acid. The 15-hydroperoxy residue of PGG2 is then reduced to a 15-hydroxyl residue thereby forming PGH2. PGH2 is the parent prostanoid to all other prostanoids. It is metabolized by (see diagram in Prostanoid): a) The prostaglandin E synthase pathway in which any one of three isozymes, PTGES, PTGES2, or PTGES3, convert PGH2 to PGE2 (subsequent products of this pathway include PGA2 and PGB2 (see ); b) PGF synthase which converts PGH2 to PGF2α; c) Prostaglandin D2 synthase which converts PGH2 to PGD2 (subsequent products in this pathway include 15-dPGJ2 (see Cyclopentenone prostaglandin); d) Thromboxane synthase which converts PGH2 to TXA2 (subsequent products in this pathway include TXB2); and e) Prostacyclin synthase which converts PGH2 to PGI2 (subsequent products in this pathway include 6-keto-PGFα. These pathways have been shown or in some cases presumed to metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid to eicosanoid analogs of the sited products that have three rather than two double bonds and therefore contain the number 3 in place of 2 attached to their names (e.g. PGE3 instead of PGE2).

The PGE2, PGE1, and PGD2 products formed in the pathways just cited can undergo a spontaneous dehydration reaction to form PGA2, PGA1, and PGJ2, respectively; PGJ2 may then undergo a spontaneous isomerization followed by a dehydration reaction to form in series Δ12-PGJ2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2.

PGH2 has a 5-carbon ring bridged by molecular oxygen. Its derived PGS have lost this oxygen bridge and contain a single, unsaturated 5-carbon ring with the exception of thromboxane A2 which possesses a 6-member ring consisting of one oxygen and 5 carbon atoms. The 5-carbon ring of prostacyclin is conjoined to a second ring consisting of 4 carbon and one oxygen atom. And, the 5 member ring of the cyclopentenone prostaglandins possesses an unsaturated bond in a conjugated system with a carbonyl group that causes these PGs to form bonds with a diverse range of bioactive proteins (for more see the diagrams at Prostanoid).

=== Hydroxyeicosatetraenoate (HETE) and leukotriene (LT) pathways ===
The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO or ALOX5) converts arachidonic acid into 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which may be released and rapidly reduced to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) by ubiquitous cellular glutathione-dependent peroxidases. Alternately, ALOX5 uses its LTA synthase activity to act convert 5-HPETE to leukotriene A4 (LTA4). LTA4 is then metabolized either to LTB4 by leukotriene A4 hydrolase or leukotriene C4 (LTC4) by either LTC4 synthase or microsomal glutathione S-transferase 2 (MGST2). Either of the latter two enzymes act to attach the sulfur of cysteine&#x27;s thio- (i.e. SH) group in the tripeptide glutamate-cysteine-glycine to carbon 6 of LTA4 thereby forming LTC4. After release from its parent cell, the glutamate and glycine residues of LTC4 are removed step-wise by gamma-glutamyltransferase and a dipeptidase to form sequentially LTD4 and LTE4. The decision to form LTB4 versus LTC4 depends on the relative content of LTA4 hydrolase versus LTC4 synthase (or glutathione S-transferase in cells; eosinophils, mast cells, and alveolar macrophages possess relatively high levels of LTC4 synthase and accordingly form LTC4 rather than or to a far greater extent than LTB4. 5-LOX may also work in series with cytochrome P450 oxygenases or aspirin-treated COX2 to form Resolvins RvE1, RvE2, and 18S-RvE1 (see ).

The enzyme arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase (12-LO or ALOX12) metabolizes arachidonic acid to the &quot;S&quot; stereoisomer of 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) which is rapidly reduced by cellular peroxidases to the &quot;S&quot; stereoisomer of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) or further metabolized to hepoxilins (Hx) such as HxA3 and HxB.

The enzymes 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LO-1 or ALOX15) and 15-lipoxygenase-2 (15-LO-2, ALOX15B) metabolize arachidonic acid to the &quot;S&quot; stereoisomer of 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HPETE) which is rapidly reduced by cellular peroxidases to the &quot;S&quot; stereoisomer of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE). The 15-lipoxygenases (particularly ALOX15) may also act in series with 5-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, or aspirin-treated COX2 to form the lipoxins and epi-lipoxins or with P450 oxygenases or aspirin-treated COX2 
to form Resolvin E3 (see ).

A subset of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) microsome-bound ω hydroxylases metabolize arachidonic acid to 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) and 19-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid by an omega oxidation reaction.

===Epoxyeicosanoid pathway===
The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenases, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, CYP2J2, and CYP2S1 metabolize arachidonic acid to the non-classic epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by converting one of the fatty acid&#x27;s double bonds to its epoxide to form one or more of the following EETs, 14,15-ETE, 11,12-EET, 8,9-ETE, and 4,5-ETE. 14,15-EET and 11,12-EET are the major EETs produced by mammalian, including human, tissues. The same CYPs but also CYP4A1, CYP4F8, and CYP4F12 metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid to five epoxide epoxyeicosatetraenoic acids (EEQs) viz., 17,18-EEQ, 14,15-EEQ, 11,12-EEQ. 8,9-EEQ, and 5,6-EEQ.

==Function, pharmacology, and clinical significance==
The following table lists a sampling of the major eicosanoids that possess clinically relevant biological activity, the cellular receptors (see Cell surface receptor) that they stimulate or, where noted, antagonize to attain this activity, some of the major functions which they regulate (either promote or inhibit) in humans and mouse models, and some of their relevancies to human diseases.

===Prostanoids===

Many of the prostanoids are known to mediate local symptoms of inflammation: vasoconstriction or vasodilation, coagulation, pain, and fever. Inhibition of COX-1 and/or the inducible COX-2 isoforms is the hallmark of NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin. Prostanoids also activate the PPARγ members of the steroid/thyroid family of nuclear hormone receptors, and directly influence gene transcription.
Prostanoids have numerous other relevancies to clinical medicine as evidence by their use, the use of their more stable pharmacological analogs, of the use of their receptor antagonists as indicated in the following chart.

===Cyclopentenone prostaglandins===

PGA1, PGA2, PGJ2, Δ12-PGJ2, and 15-deox-Δ12,14-PGJ2 exhibit a wide range of anti-inflammatory and inflammation-resolving actions in diverse animal models. They therefore appear to function in a manner similar to specialized pro-resolving mediators although one of their mechanisms of action, forming covalent bonds with key signaling proteins, differs from those of the specialized pro-resolving mediators.

===HETEs and oxo-ETEs===

As indicated in their individual Wikipedia pages, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (which, like 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, acts through the OXER1 receptor), 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid show numerous activities in animal and human cells as well as in animal models that are related to, for example, inflammation, allergic reactions, cancer cell growth, blood flow to tissues, and/or blood pressure. However, their function and relevancy to human physiology and pathology have not as yet been shown.

===Leukotrienes===

The three cysteinyl leukotrienes, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4, are potent bronchoconstrictors, increasers of vascular permeability in postcapillary venules, and stimulators of mucus secretion that are released from the lung tissue of asthmatic subjects exposed to specific allergens. They play a pathophysiological role in diverse types of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Drugs that block their activation of the CYSLTR1 receptor viz., montelukast, zafirlukast, and pranlukast, are used clinically as maintenance treatment for allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced asthma and rhinitis (see aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease); exercise- and cold-air induced asthma (see Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction); and childhood sleep apnea due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy (see ). When combined with antihistamine drug therapy, they also appear useful for treating urticarial diseases such as hives.

===Lipoxins and epi-lipoxins===

LxA4, LxB4, 15-epi-LxA4, and 15-epi-LXB4, like other members of the specialized pro-resolving mediators class of eicosanoids, possess anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving activity. In a randomized controlled trial, AT-LXA4 and a comparatively stable analog of LXB4, 15&quot;R/S&quot;-methyl-LXB4, reduced the severity of eczema in a study of 60 infants and, in another study, inhaled LXA4 decreased LTC4-initiated bronchoprovocation in patients with asthma.

===Eoxins===

The eoxins (EXC4, EXD4, EXE5) are newly described. They stimulate vascular permeability in an ex vivo human vascular endothelial model system, and in a small study of 32 volunteers EXC4 production by eosinophils isolated from severe and aspirin-intolerant asthmatics was greater than that from healthy volunteers and mild asthmatic patients; these findings have been suggested to indicate that the eoxins have pro-inflammatory actions and therefore potentially involved in various allergic reactions. Production of eoxins by Reed–Sternberg cells cells has also led to suggestion that they are involved in Hodgkins disease. However, the clinical significance of eoxins has not yet been demonstrated.

===Resolvin metabolites of eicosapentaenoic acid===

RvE1, 18S-RvE1, RvE2, and RvE3, like other members of the specialized pro-resolving mediators) class of eicosanoids, possess anti-inflammatory and inflammation resolving activity. A synthetic analog of RvE1 is in clinical phase III testing (see Phases of clinical research) for the treatment of the inflammation-based dry eye syndrome; along with this study, other clinical trials (NCT01639846, NCT01675570, NCT00799552 and NCT02329743) using an RvE1 analogue to treat various ocular conditions are underway. RvE1 is also in clinical development studies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and hearing loss.

===Other metabolites of eicosapentaenoic acid===
The metabolites of eicosapentaenoic acid that are analogs of their arachidonic acid-derived prostanoid, HETE, and LT counterparts include: the 3-series prostanoids (e.g. PGE3, PGD3, PGF3α, PGI3, and TXA3), the hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (e.g. 5-HEPE, 12-HEPE, 15-HEPE, and 20-HEPE), and the 5-series LTs (e.g. LTB5, LTC5, LTD5, and LTE5). Many of the 3-series prostanoids, the hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids, and the 5-series LT have been shown or thought to be weaker stimulators of their target cells and tissues than their arachidonic acid-derived analogs. They are proposed to reduce the actions of their arachidonate-derived analogs by replacing their production with weaker analogs. Eicosapentaenoic acid-derived counterparts of the eoxins have not been described.

===Epoxyeicosanoids===

The epoxy eicosatrienoic acids (or EETs)—and, presumably, the epoxy eicosatetraenoic acids—have vasodilating actions on heart, kidney, and other blood vessels as well as on the kidney&#x27;s reabsorption of sodium and water, and act to reduce blood pressure and ischemic and other injuries to the heart, brain, and other tissues; they may also act to reduce inflammation, promote the growth and metastasis of certain tumors, promote the growth of new blood vessels, in the central nervous system, regulate the release of neuropeptide hormones, and in the peripheral nervous system inhibit or reduce pain perception.

== The ω−3 and ω−6 series ==
Arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4 ω−6) sits at the head of the &quot;arachidonic acid cascade&quot; – more than twenty eicosanoid-mediated signaling paths controlling a wide array of cellular functions, especially those regulating inflammation, immunity, and the central nervous system.

In the inflammatory response, two other groups of dietary fatty acids form cascades that parallel and compete with the arachidonic acid cascade. EPA (20:5 ω−3) provides the most important competing cascade. DGLA (20:3 ω−6) provides a third, less prominent cascade. These two parallel cascades soften the inflammatory effects of AA and its products. Low dietary intake of these less-inflammatory fatty acids, especially the ω−3s, has been linked to several inflammation-related diseases, and perhaps some mental illnesses.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health and the National Library of Medicine state that there is &#x27;A&#x27; level evidence that increased dietary ω−3 improves outcomes in hypertriglyceridemia, secondary cardiovascular disease prevention, and hypertension.
There is &#x27;B&#x27; level evidence (&#x27;good scientific evidence&#x27;) for increased dietary ω−3 in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and protection from ciclosporin toxicity in organ transplant patients.
They also note more preliminary evidence showing that dietary ω−3 can ease symptoms in several psychiatric disorders.

Besides the influence on eicosanoids, dietary polyunsaturated fats modulate immune response through three other molecular mechanisms. They
(a) alter membrane composition and function, including the composition of lipid rafts;
(b) change cytokine biosynthesis; and (c) directly activate gene transcription. Of these, the action on eicosanoids is the best explored

Recent data in 2024 has emerged that neuronal integrity breakdown was reduced by ω−3 treatment in &quot;APOE*E4&quot; carriers, suggesting that this treatment may be beneficial for this specific group suggested fish oil supplements might help older adults fight Alzheimer’s disease. 
===Mechanisms of ω−3 action===

In general, the eicosanoids derived from AA promote inflammation, and those from EPA and from GLA (&quot;via&quot; DGLA) are less inflammatory, or inactive, or even anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving.

The figure shows the ω−3 and −6 synthesis chains, along with the major eicosanoids from AA, EPA, and DGLA.

Dietary ω−3 and GLA counter the inflammatory effects of AA&#x27;s eicosanoids in three ways, along the eicosanoid pathways:
*&quot;Displacement&quot;—Dietary ω−3 decreases tissue concentrations of AA, so there is less to form ω−6 eicosanoids.
*&quot;Competitive inhibition&quot;—DGLA and EPA compete with AA for access to the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes. So the presence of DGLA and EPA in tissues lowers the output of AA&#x27;s eicosanoids.
*&quot;Counteraction&quot;—Some DGLA and EPA derived eicosanoids counteract their AA derived counterparts.

===Role in inflammation ===
Since antiquity, the cardinal signs of inflammation have been known as: calor (warmth), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling), and rubor (redness). The eicosanoids are involved with each of these signs.

&quot;Redness&quot;—An insect&#x27;s sting will trigger the classic inflammatory response. Short acting vasoconstrictors — TXA2 — are released quickly after the injury. The site may momentarily turn pale. Then TXA2 mediates the release of the vasodilators PGE2 and LTB4. The blood vessels engorge and the injury reddens.
&quot;Swelling&quot;—LTB4 makes the blood vessels more permeable. Plasma leaks out into the connective tissues, and they swell. The process also loses pro-inflammatory cytokines.
&quot;Pain&quot;—The cytokines increase COX-2 activity. This elevates levels of PGE2, sensitizing pain neurons.
&quot;Heat&quot;—PGE2 is also a potent pyretic agent. Aspirin and NSAIDS—drugs that block the COX pathways and stop prostanoid synthesis—limit fever or the heat of localized inflammation.

==History==
In 1930, gynecologist Raphael Kurzrok and pharmacologist Charles Leib characterized prostaglandin as a component of semen.
Between 1929 and 1932, George and Mildred Burr showed that restricting fat from animals&#x27; diets led to a deficiency disease, and first described the essential fatty acids.
In 1935, von Euler identified prostaglandin.
In 1964, Bergström and Samuelsson linked these observations when they showed that the &quot;classical&quot; eicosanoids were derived from arachidonic acid, which had earlier been considered to be one of the essential fatty acids.
In 1971, Vane showed that aspirin and similar drugs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. Von Euler received the Nobel Prize in medicine in 1970, which
Samuelsson, Vane, and Bergström also received in 1982.
E. J. Corey received it in chemistry in 1990 largely for his synthesis of prostaglandins.

<text>VDARE is an American far-right website promoting opposition to immigration to the United States. It is associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and the alt-right. &quot;Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia&quot; describes VDARE as &quot;one of the most prolific anti-immigration media outlets in the United States&quot; and states that it is &quot;broadly concerned with race issues in the United States&quot;. Established in 1999, the website&#x27;s editor is Peter Brimelow, who once stated that &quot;whites built American culture&quot; and that &quot;it is at risk from non-whites who would seek to change it&quot;.

The Southern Poverty Law Center describes VDARE as &quot;an anti-immigration hate website&quot; that &quot;regularly publishes articles by prominent white nationalists, race scientists, and anti-Semites&quot;, including Steve Sailer, Jared Taylor, J. Philippe Rushton, Samuel T. Francis, John Derbyshire and Pat Buchanan. Brimelow acknowledges that VDARE published writings by white nationalists but has said that VDARE is not a &quot;white nationalist Web site&quot;.

In July 2024, it was announced that VDARE would be suspending operations after 25 years of operation. Peter Brimelow also stepped down as president of the VDARE Foundation.

==History==

Peter Brimelow, who edits VDARE, is a former editor at the &quot;National Review&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot;. The English-born Brimelow founded the website in 1999 under the auspices of the Center for American Unity, a Virginia-based organization that he also founded in 1999. VDARE was founded as an outgrowth of Brimelow&#x27;s anti-immigration activism and the publication of his book &quot;Alien Nation: Common Sense About America&#x27;s Immigration Disaster&quot;. The website says it is concerned with the &quot;racial and culture identity of America&quot; and &quot;honest consideration of race and ethnicity, the foundations of human grouping, that human differences can be explained and their social consequences understood, whether those differences are philosophical, cultural or biological.&quot;

Brimelow was president of the center, which funded VDARE.com until 2007, when the center announced an intent to focus on litigation. The VDARE Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization, was formed by Brimelow to take the place of the center as the website&#x27;s sponsor. Brimelow&#x27;s wife, Lydia Brimelow, is VDARE&#x27;s advancement officer.

The name &quot;VDARE&quot; and the site&#x27;s logo, the head of a white doe, refer to Virginia Dare, the first child born to English settlers in the New World in the late 16th century. Dare disappeared along with every other member of the Roanoke Colony. &quot;Anti-Immigration in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia&quot; explains that &quot;For Brimelow, Anglo-Saxon Americans and their culture are in danger of disappearing like Virginia Dare; he writes that he considered adding a fictional vignette at the end of his book &quot;Alien Nation&quot; (1995), in which the last white family flees Los Angeles, which had been overrun by the crime and pollution caused by its non-white residents.&quot;

Brimelow has written on the site that United States immigration policy constitutes &quot;Adolf Hitler&#x27;s posthumous revenge on America&quot;. In a radio interview with Alan Colmes, he said he wished to return to the US immigration policies before 1965, when restrictions to non-whites were lifted, as &quot;the US is a white nation.&quot;

=== New York Attorney General investigation ===

In February 2020, the VDARE Foundation purchased the Samuel Taylor Suit Cottage (also known as the Berkeley Castle or Berkeley Springs Castle), a Medieval-style castle located on a hill above Berkeley Springs, in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, for $1.4 million. New York Attorney General (NYAG) Letitia James alleged that VDARE had violated New York law by misusing non-profit resources while residing on the castle grounds since March 2020.

In March 2024, a New York state judge found the VDARE Foundation in civil contempt for failing to turn over evidence related to the investigation. The organization is required to pay a $250-per-day fine until it complies with a subpoena issued by the NYAG in 2022. In July, it was announced that VDARE would be suspending operations, with Brimelow resigning as president of the VDARE Foundation. A spokesperson for the attorney general&#x27;s office said that the website&#x27;s closure would not affect their investigation.

==Hate speech and white nationalism==
===Designation as a hate website===
The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which tracks extremist groups in the United States, wrote that VDARE was &quot;once a relatively mainstream anti-immigration page&quot; but had become &quot;a meeting place for many on the radical right&quot; by 2003. The SPLC describes VDARE as &quot;an anti-immigration hate website&quot; which &quot;regularly publishes articles by prominent white nationalists, race scientists and anti-Semites&quot;. The SPLC cited examples such as a column concerning immigration from Mexico that warned of a &quot;Mexican invasion&quot; where &quot;high teenage birthrates, poverty, ignorance and disease will be what remains&quot;, and an essay complaining how the U.S. government encourages &quot;the garbage of Africa&quot; to come to the United States.

The SPLC has described VDARE&#x27;s contributor list as &quot;a Rolodex of the most prominent pseudo-intellectual racists and anti-Semites. They include people such as Jared Taylor and Kevin MacDonald. Taylor (who Brimelow acknowledges is a &quot;white nationalist&quot;) once wrote that black people are incapable of sustaining any kind of civilization, while MacDonald is a retired professor who wrote a trilogy claiming that Jews are genetically driven to undermine the Christian societies they live in. Another former contributor, Sam Francis, was the editor of a newspaper published by the Council of Conservative Citizens, a white supremacist group. Francis died in 2005.

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) similarly concludes that &quot;VDARE posts, promotes, and archives the work of racists, anti-immigrant figures, and anti-Semites&quot;.

===Attempted domain name delisting===
In June 2020, the domain registrar Network Solutions announced plans to terminate the account for VDARE. An attorney for Network Solutions cited a policy prohibiting customers using its domains from &quot;display[ing] bigotry, racism, discrimination, or hatred in any manner whatsoever&quot;, and stated that VDARE had until June 26 to transfer its domain name to a different registrar before it would be deleted. An update to its WHOIS data was made on June 26, 2020. , the domain exists under a different registrar.

=== Social media presence and bans ===
In August 2019, VDARE&#x27;s YouTube channel was banned. The ban was later reversed. The channel was permanently banned in August 2020 for violating YouTube&#x27;s policies against hate speech.

In November 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; identified VDARE as one of several white nationalist websites which had remained active on Facebook, contrary to Facebook&#x27;s stated intention to ban such material. In May 2020, VDARE and the similar website &quot;The Unz Review&quot; were banned by Facebook. According to Facebook, the sites formed a network of &quot;coordinated inauthentic behavior&quot; intended to influence the 2020 election via fake accounts.

As of October 2023, VDARE operates a verified Twitter account.

===White nationalist writings===
VDARE is regarded as a white nationalist website. David Weigel wrote in 2010 that the site &quot;is best known for publishing work by white nationalists while maintaining that it is not a white nationalist site&quot;.

Brimelow &quot;denies that the organization itself is white nationalist, but he admits that VDARE.com provides a forum for a variety of viewpoints, including white nationalism&quot;. Of individuals like Taylor, Brimelow has written they &quot;aim to defend the interests of American whites. They are not white supremacists. They do not advocate violence. They are rational and civil.&quot; As immigration from the developing world increases, he believes &quot;this type of interest-group &#x27;white nationalism&#x27; will inexorably increase.&quot; Brimelow has participated on panels multiple times with Taylor and Richard Spencer on the aims of the alt-right.

<doc id="631336" wikidata="Q4817105" url="?curid=631336" title="Atmospheric diffraction">
<text>Atmospheric diffraction is manifested in the following principal ways:

* Optical atmospheric diffraction
* Radio wave diffraction is the scattering of radio frequency or lower frequencies from the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere, resulting in the ability to achieve greater distance radio broadcasting.
* Sound wave diffraction is the bending of sound waves, as the sound travels around edges of geometric objects. This produces the effect of being able to hear even when the source is blocked by a solid object. The sound waves bend appreciably around the solid object.

However, if the object has a diameter greater than the acoustic wavelength, a &#x27;sound shadow&#x27; is cast behind the object where the sound is inaudible. (Note: some sound may be propagated through the object depending on material).

==Optical atmospheric diffraction==

When light travels through thin clouds made up of nearly uniform sized water or aerosol droplets or ice crystals, diffraction or bending of light occurs as the light is diffracted by the edges of the particles. This degree of bending of light depends on the wavelength (color) of light and the size of the particles. The result is a pattern of rings, which seem to emanate from the Sun, the Moon, a planet, or another astronomical object. The most distinct part of this pattern is a central, nearly white disk. This resembles an atmospheric Airy disc but is not actually an Airy disk. It is different from rainbows and halos, which are mainly caused by refraction.

The left photo shows a diffraction ring around the rising Sun caused by a veil of aerosol. This effect dramatically disappeared when the Sun rose high enough until the pattern was no longer visible on the Earth&#x27;s surface. This phenomenon is sometimes called the corona effect, not to be confused with the solar corona.

On the right is a 1/10-second exposure showing an overexposed full moon. The Moon is seen through thin vaporous clouds, which glow with a bright disk surrounded by an illuminated red ring. A longer exposure would show more faint colors beyond the outside red ring.

Another form of atmospheric diffraction or bending of light occurs when light moves through fine layers of particulate dust trapped primarily in the middle layers of the troposphere. This effect differs from water based atmospheric diffraction because the dust material is opaque whereas water allows light to pass through it. This has the effect of tinting the light the color of the dust particles. This tinting can vary from red to yellow depending on geographical location. the other primary difference is that dust based diffraction acts as a magnifier instead of creating a distinct halo. This occurs because the opaque matter does not share the lensing properties of water. The effect is to make an object visibly larger while being more indistinct as the dust distorts the image. This effect varies largely based on the amount and type of dust in the atmosphere.

==Radio wave propagation in the ionosphere==


The ionosphere is a layer of partially ionized gases high above the majority of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; these gases are ionized by cosmic rays originating on the sun. When radio waves travel into this zone, which commences about 80 kilometers above the earth, they experience diffraction in a manner similar to the visible light phenomenon described above. In this case some of the electromagnetic energy is bent in a large arc, such that it can return to the Earth&#x27;s surface at a very distant point (on the order of hundreds of kilometers from the broadcast source. More remarkably some of this radio wave energy bounces off the Earth&#x27;s surface and reaches the ionosphere for a second time, at a distance even farther away than the first time. Consequently, a high powered transmitter can effectively broadcast over 1000 kilometers by using multiple &quot;skips&quot; off of the ionosphere. And, at times of favorable atmospheric conditions good &quot;skip&quot; occurs, then even a low power transmitter can be heard halfway around the world. This often occurs for &quot;novice&quot; radio amateurs &quot;hams&quot; who are limited by law to transmitters with no more than 65 watts. The Kon-Tiki expedition communicated regularly with a 6 watt transmitter from the middle of the Pacific. For more details see the &quot;communications&quot; part of the &quot;Kon-Tiki expedition&quot; entry in Wikipedia.

An exotic variant of this radio wave propagation has been examined to show that, theoretically, the ionospheric bounce could be greatly exaggerated if a high powered spherical acoustical wave were created in the ionosphere from a source on earth.

==Acoustical diffraction near the Earth&#x27;s surface==

In the case of sound waves travelling near the Earth&#x27;s surface, the waves are diffracted or bent as they traverse by a geometric edge, such as a wall or building. This phenomenon leads to a very important practical effect: that we can hear &quot;around corners&quot;. Because of the frequencies involved considerable amount of the sound energy (on the order of ten percent) actually travels into this would be sound &quot;shadow zone&quot;. Visible light exhibits a similar effect, but, due to its much shorter wavelength, only a minute amount of light energy travels around a corner.

A useful branch of acoustics dealing with the design of noise barriers examines this acoustical diffraction phenomenon in quantitative detail to calculate the optimum height and placement of a soundwall or berm adjacent to a highway.

This phenomenon is also inherent in calculating the sound levels from aircraft noise, so that an accurate determination of topographic features may be understood. In that way one can produce sound level isopleths, or contour maps, which faithfully depict outcomes over variable terrain.

<doc id="631338" wikidata="Q1472463" url="?curid=631338" title="Sick man of Europe">
<text>&quot;Sick man of Europe&quot; is a label given to a state located in Europe that is experiencing economic difficulties, social unrest or impoverishment. It is most famously used to refer to the Ottoman Empire whilst they were in a state of decline. 

Emperor Nicholas I of the Russian Empire is considered to be the first to use the term &quot;Sick Man&quot; to describe the Ottoman Empire in the mid-19th century. The characterization existed during the &quot;Eastern question&quot; in diplomatic history, which also referred to the decline of the Ottoman Empire in terms of the balance of power in Europe. After the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, the term has been applied to other states. In modern usage, the term has faced criticism due to its origins and arguable over-usage. 

Throughout the 1960s to the 1980s, the term was also most notably used for the United Kingdom when it lost its superpower status as the Empire crumbled and its home islands experienced significant deindustrialization, coupled with high inflation and industrial unrest – such as the Winter of Discontent – including having to seek loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since the mid-2010s and into the 2020s, the term being used for Britain began to see a resurgence after Brexit, a cost-of-living crisis and industrial disputes and strikes becoming more commonplace.

As of 2024, Germany is most commonly referred to as the &#x27;Sick Man of Europe&#x27; due to its consistently stagnant economy and in particular, its industrial base, since the COVID-19 pandemic and the loss of access to inexpensive energy resulting from the Nord Stream pipelines sabotage. This has been demonstrated by Germany having the lowest GDP growth amongst the large G7 industrialised economies compared to the pre-pandemic level. 

==Origin==
=== Early usage ===
Russian Tsar Nicholas I (), seeking to expand into parts of the Ottoman Empire during the Eastern Question, had described Turkey as &quot;sick&quot; or &quot;sick man&quot; during his meeting with Austrian chancellor Metternich () in Münchengrätz, two months after the Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi in September 1833. In his own writing, Metternich said he had argued against this characterization. Conventionally, foreign minister Metternich was opposed to the characterization of the Ottoman Empire as &quot;sick man of the Bosphorus&quot; because this could lead to his country, the Austrian Empire, becoming the &quot;sick man of the Danube&quot;. Other historians, evaluating the conservative &quot;Holy Alliance&quot; of the time, have seen Metternich&#x27;s foreign policy as aligned with Nicholas, including the policy towards the Ottoman Empire.

=== Crimean War ===
British statesman John Russell in 1853, in the run-up to the Crimean War, reported that Nicholas I of Russia described the Ottoman Empire as &quot;a sick man—a very sick man&quot;, a &quot;man who has fallen into a state of decrepitude&quot;, and a &quot;sick man ... gravely ill&quot;.

There has been some degree of debate about the source of the quotation, which often relies on historical documents held or communicated personally. Historian Harold Temperley (1879–1939) gave the date for the first conversation as 9 January 1853, like Goldfrank. According to Temperley, Seymour in a private conversation had to push the Tsar to be more specific about the Ottoman Empire. Eventually, the Tsar stated, 
Turkey seems to be falling to pieces, the fall will be a great misfortune. It is very important that England and Russia should come to a perfectly good understanding ... and that neither should take any decisive step of which the other is not apprized [&quot;sic&quot;]. 
And then, closer to the attributed phrase: We have a sick man on our hands, a man gravely ill, it will be a great misfortune if one of these days he slips through our hands, especially before the necessary arrangements are made.

Different interpretations existed between the two countries on the &quot;Eastern Question&quot; by the time of the Crimean War. The British Ambassador G. H. Seymour agreed with Tsar Nicholas&#x27;s diagnosis, but he very deferentially disagreed with the Tsar&#x27;s recommended treatment of the patient; he responded, Your Majesty is so gracious that you will allow me to make one further observation. Your Majesty says the man is sick; it is very true; but your Majesty will deign to excuse me if I remark, that it is the part of the generous and strong man to treat with gentleness the sick and feeble man.Temperley then asserts, The &#x27;sickliness&#x27; of Turkey obsessed Nicholas during his reign. What he really said was omitted in the Blue Book from a mistaken sense of decorum. He said not the &#x27;sick man&#x27; but the &quot;bear dies … the bear is dying … you may give him musk but even musk will not long keep him alive.&quot;

Christopher de Bellaigue argued that neither Nicholas nor Seymour completed the epithet with the prepositional phrase &quot;of Europe&quot;. 

The first appearance of the phrase &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; appears in &quot;The New York Times&quot; (12 May 1860): The condition of Austria at the present moment is not less threatening in itself, though less alarming for the peace of the world, than was the condition of Turkey when the Tsar Nicholas invited England to draw up with him the last will and testament of the &#x27;sick man of Europe.&#x27; It is, indeed, hardly within the range of probability that another twelvemonth should pass over the House of Habsburg without bringing upon the Austrian Empire a catastrophe unmatched in modern history since the downfall of Poland. The author of this article can be seen to be using the term to point to a second &quot;sick man&quot; of Europe, the Habsburg monarchy.

=== World War One ===
Later, this view led the Allies in World War I to underestimate the Ottoman Empire, leading in part to the disastrous Gallipoli Campaign. However, the &quot;sick man&quot; eventually collapsed after defeat in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I.

==Post-World War I usage==
After the demise of the Ottoman Empire, writers have described many countries as the &quot;sick men&quot; of Europe or the Old World.

=== France ===
During the 1950s, France was characterized as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;, due to a combination of economic issues and a fading optimism since the country was reestablished after World War II. In 1953, Paul Reynaud described France as such to the National Assembly.

A 2007 report by Morgan Stanley referred to France as the &quot;new sick man of Europe&quot;. This label was reaffirmed in January 2014 by European newspapers such as &quot;The Guardian&quot; and . They justified this with France&#x27;s high unemployment, weak economic growth and poor industrial output.

=== Germany ===
In the late 1990s, Germany was often labeled with this term because of its economic problems, especially due to the costs of German reunification after 1990, which were estimated to amount to over €1.5 trillion (statement of Freie Universität Berlin). It continued to be used in the early 2000s, and as Germany slipped into recession in 2003. In contrast, a 2016 article by &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the German economy under Angela Merkel as a &quot;revival&quot; from the country&#x27;s previous &quot;sick man&quot; status. However, when Germany was experiencing economic issues again in the 2020s, concerns about the &quot;sick man&quot; characterisation reemerged, with Kiel Institute President Moritz Schularick saying: &quot;If Germany does not want to become the &#x27;sick man of Europe&#x27; once again, it must now courageously turn its attention to the growth sectors of tomorrow instead of fearfully spending billions to preserve yesterday&#x27;s energy-intensive industries.&quot;

=== Italy ===
In 1972, PSDI politician Luigi Preti wrote a book titled &quot;Sick Italy&quot; (). In it, he says that Italy was at risk of becoming &quot;the sick man of Europe who has proved unable to keep in step as soon as he reached the first milestone on the road to well‐being&quot;.

In May 2005, this title was again attributed to Italy, with &quot;The Economist&quot; describing it as &quot;the real sick man of Europe&quot;. This refers to Italy&#x27;s structural and political difficulties thought to inhibit economic reforms to relaunch economic growth. In 2018, Italy was again referred to as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; following post-election deadlock. In 2008, in an opinion piece criticizing the country&#x27;s approach to economic reform, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; also used the term to describe Italy, as did a CNBC op-ed in 2020.

=== Russia ===
The Russian Empire in 1917 was described as the &quot;Sick Man of Europe&quot; in an edition of &quot;The New York Times&quot; from that year. In the 1917 article by Charles Richard Crane, the illness metaphor is used more directly, with the empire described as &quot;Suffering From Overdose of Exaggerated Modernism in Socialist Reform Ideas&quot;, and &quot;the danger for the patient lay in the fact that too many quacks and ignorant specialists were contending for the right to be admitted to the bedside and administer nostrums.&quot;

Post-Soviet Russia has also been referred to as such in the 2007 book &quot;Kremlin Rising: Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Russia and the End of Revolution&quot; by Peter Baker and Susan Glasser, and by Mark Steyn in his 2006 book &quot;America Alone: The End of the World as We Know It&quot;.

In the aftermath of the Wagner Group rebellion during the Russian invasion of Ukraine (and Vladimir Putin&#x27;s perceived weakness in confronting it), political scientist Aleksandar Đokić said in 2023 that the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; moniker &quot;seem[ed] fitting for Putin’s Russia&quot;. While acknowledging the term itself to be simplistic, Đokić stated that:

===United Kingdom===
Throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, the United Kingdom was sometimes characterized as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot;, first by commentators, and later at home by critics of the third Wilson/Callaghan ministry due to industrial strife and poor economic performance compared with other European countries. Some observers consider this era to have started with the devaluation of the pound in 1967, culminating with the so-called Winter of Discontent of 1978–79. At different points throughout the decade, numerous countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, and Greece were cited by the American business press as being &quot;on the verge of sickness&quot; as well. 

In the summer of 2017, the United Kingdom was again referred to as the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; due to the immediate impact of the EU referendum results. The term was used frequently by the early 2020s with regards to the economic effects of Brexit, ongoing industrial action in the public sector, leadership turmoil within the Conservative party, and the cost of living crisis. As of June 2023, the label is still frequently applied to the United Kingdom as inflation and price increases continue to generate economic uncertainty within the country.

The term was also more literally applied during the COVID-19 pandemic after a new strain of coronavirus, the Alpha variant, led to a number of countries closing their borders to UK air travel.

=== Other uses ===
Swedish Diplomat and former Prime Minister Carl Bildt once referred to Serbia under the rule of Slobodan Milošević as a candidate for the new &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; in 1997. This is due to political instability in Yugoslavia and its former territories caused by Yugoslav Wars that rocked the Balkan region from 1991 until 2001.

In 2007, &quot;The Economist&quot; described Portugal as &quot;a new sick man of Europe&quot;.

In July 2009, the pejorative was given by EurActiv to Greece in view of the 2008 Greek riots, rising unemployment, and political corruption.

In spring 2011, Eurozine suggested that the European Union was the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; by entitling an event focusing on the Eurozone crisis, &quot;The EU: the real sick man of Europe?&quot;

In 2015 and 2016, Finland was called the &quot;sick man of Europe&quot; due to its recession and lacklustre growth, in a time when virtually all other European countries had recovered from the Great Recession.

<doc id="631340" wikidata="Q468737" url="?curid=631340" title="Pang De">
<text>Pang De () (died 219), courtesy name Lingming, was a Chinese military general who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty. He started his career under the warlord Ma Teng, who was based in Liang Province. In 211, Ma Teng&#x27;s son Ma Chao, along with a coalition of warlords from Liang Province, started a rebellion against the Han central government, which was controlled by the warlord Cao Cao. After Cao Cao defeated Ma Chao and the coalition at the Battle of Tong Pass, Ma Chao fled to Hanzhong Commandery and took shelter under the warlord Zhang Lu. Pang De accompanied him to Hanzhong. When Ma Chao defected from Zhang Lu&#x27;s side in order to join the warlord Liu Bei, Pang De remained in Hanzhong and eventually came to serve Cao Cao after Cao Cao defeated Zhang Lu at the Battle of Yangping and took over Hanzhong. In 219, Pang De fought at the Battle of Fancheng under Cao Ren&#x27;s command against Liu Bei&#x27;s forces led by Guan Yu. Pang De was captured in battle and eventually executed by Guan Yu when he refused to surrender.

== Biography ==
Pang De was from Huandao County (), Nan&#x27;an Commandery (), Liang Province, which is located east of present-day Longxi County, Gansu. In his youth, he served as an Assistant Officer () in the local commandery office.

=== Early military career ===
During the Chuping era (190–193) in the reign of Emperor Xian, the Liang Province Rebellion broke out. Pang De joined the warlord Ma Teng in suppressing the revolts by the Qiang and Di tribes, and was promoted to Colonel () for his contributions in battle.

In 202, the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government, led his forces to attack rival warlords Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at the Battle of Liyang. When Yuan Tan ordered his subordinates Guo Yuan and Gao Gan to lead a separate force to attack Hedong Commandery, Cao Cao ordered Zhong Yao to recruit forces from Liang Province to deal with Guo Yuan and Gao Gan. Ma Teng responded to Zhong Yao&#x27;s call and sent his son Ma Chao and Pang De to assist Zhong Yao in attacking Guo Yuan and Gao Gan at Pingyang County (平陽縣; west of present-day Linfen, Shanxi). Pang De led the vanguard, slew Guo Yuan in the midst of battle and took his head, without knowing that the man he killed was Guo Yuan. After the battle, when Zhong Yao&#x27;s men searched the battlefield, they found Guo Yuan&#x27;s headless body. Shortly after, Pang De went to meet Zhong Yao and he threw Guo Yuan&#x27;s head in front of him. Zhong Yao cried when he recognised Guo Yuan&#x27;s head because Guo was actually his maternal nephew. Pang De immediately apologised to Zhong Yao, who replied, &quot;Even though Guo Yuan was my nephew, he was an enemy of the state. Why do you apologise?&quot; For his contributions, Pang De was appointed as a General of the Household () and made a Marquis of a Chief Village ().

Later, Pang De followed Ma Teng to suppress a rebellion by Zhang Baiqi () at Yao County (殽縣; present-day Luoning County, Henan). He was famous for his bravery in Ma Teng&#x27;s army as Pang De recorded always personally charged inside the enemy formation during battles. When Ma Teng was recalled to the imperial capital, Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), to serve as Minister of the Guards (), Pang De remained behind in Liang Province with Ma Chao.

=== Battle of Tong Pass &amp; submitting to Cao Cao ===

Around 211, Ma Chao started a rebellion against the Han central government and led a coalition of warlords from Liang Province to attack Cao Cao, leading to the Battle of Tong Pass. Cao Cao defeated Ma Chao and his allies at the battle and caused the coalition to break up. Despite his defeat, Ma Chao, with assistance from the Qiang tribes and the warlord Zhang Lu in Hanzhong Commandery, continued to ravage the lands in Liang Province and even seized control of the provincial governorship at one point. However, he was eventually driven out of Liang Province and forced to take shelter under Zhang Lu in Hanzhong. Pang De accompanied Ma Chao to Hanzhong and became one of Zhang Lu&#x27;s subordinates.

In 215, Ma Chao defected to the warlord Liu Bei and aided him in seizing control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its provincial governor, Liu Zhang. Pang De remained in Hanzhong with Zhang Lu. Later that year, Cao Cao led his forces to attack Hanzhong and defeated Zhang Lu at the Battle of Yangping. Pang De joined Zhang Lu in surrendering to Cao Cao. As Cao Cao had heard of Pang De&#x27;s valour, he immediately recruited Pang De as his subordinate and appointed him as General Who Establishes Righteousness (). Pang De was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Guanmen Village () and given 300 taxable households to form his marquisate.

=== Battle of Fancheng &amp; death ===
In 219, when Hou Yin () and Wei Kai () started a rebellion in Wan (宛; present-day Wancheng District, Nanyang, Henan), Cao Cao sent Pang De and Cao Ren to quell the uprising. After accomplishing their mission, they garrisoned at Fan (樊; also called Fancheng, in present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei) to defend Cao Cao&#x27;s territories in northern Jing Province from advances by Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu, who guarded Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in southern Jing Province. As Ma Chao (Pang De&#x27;s previous lord) and Pang Rou (龐柔; Pang De&#x27;s cousin) both served under Liu Bei, many of Cao Cao&#x27;s other subordinates were suspicious of Pang De&#x27;s allegiance towards their lord. Pang De often said, &quot;I&#x27;ve received grace from the State and I&#x27;m willing to serve the State with my life in the name of righteousness. I&#x27;ll personally slay Guan Yu. If I don&#x27;t kill Guan Yu within this year, he&#x27;ll kill me.&quot;

As Pang De arrived in Fan, he battled the rebel forces and managed to slay the rebel leaders under Hou Yin (侯音) and Wei Kai (衛開) who conspired with Guan Yu. As Pang De often rode gray horse during the battle, so Guan Yu&#x27;s men nicknamed him as &quot;white-horse general&quot; (baima jiangjun 白馬將軍), which he famous for, and feared him. Pang De later engaged Guan Yu in battle and fired an arrow which hit Guan&#x27;s forehead at one time, nearly killing the Shu general.

Cao Ren ordered Pang De to set up a separate camp ten &quot;li&quot; north of Fan. At the time, there were heavy rains for more than ten days and the Han River next to Fan burst its banks, with the water level reaching up to five-six &quot;zhang&quot;. Pang De and his subordinates retreated to the top of a dam. Guan Yu then led his marines to attack Fan and fired arrows from their warships at the dam. Pang De donned his armour, armed himself with a bow and arrows, and returned fire at the enemy, with not a single arrow missing its target. When Dong Heng () and Dong Chao (), two of Pang De&#x27;s colleagues, wanted to surrender to Guan Yu, Pang De executed them on the spot. The battle dragged on from morning until afternoon, with Guan Yu&#x27;s attacks increasing in intensity as time passed. By afternoon, Pang De and his men had expended all their arrows but they continued to engage the enemy in close quarters combat with short weapons. Pang De told his subordinate Cheng He (), &quot;I heard a good general doesn&#x27;t fear death, nor does he hope to be spared. A martyr won&#x27;t violate his principles for the sake of preserving his life. Today is the day I die.&quot; The battle raged on as the water level rose higher. By then, many of Pang De&#x27;s men had surrendered, leaving Pang with only three men. They boarded a small boat and attempted to escape and return to Cao Ren&#x27;s main camp. However, the boat capsized and Pang De fell into the water. While grabbing on to the boat to stay afloat, he was surrounded and captured by Guan Yu&#x27;s soldiers.

When brought before Guan Yu, he refused to kneel down and surrender. Guan Yu told Pang De, &quot;Your cousin is serving in Hanzhong, and I want to recruit you as a subordinate. Why don&#x27;t you surrender now?&quot; Pang De retorted angrily, &quot;Mean fellow, what is surrender? The King of Wei has thousands of troops and his might trembles the Empire. Liu Bei is an inferior man. How can he hope to resist (the King of Wei)? I&#x27;d rather be a ghost of the State than be a servant of my enemy.&quot; An angered Guan Yu then had Pang De executed.

Cao Cao was deeply grieved when he learnt of Pang De&#x27;s death and he shed tears. In 220, after Cao Pi – Cao Cao&#x27;s son and successor – forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne to him and established the state of Cao Wei, he granted Pang De the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Zhuang&quot;, which literally means &quot;robust marquis&quot;. He ordered an emissary to read out the imperial edict at Pang De&#x27;s tomb. According to the &quot;Shu Ji&quot; (蜀記; &quot;Records of Shu&quot;) by Wang Yin (), when the state of Shu Han (founded by Liu Bei) was conquered by the state of Cao Wei in 263, the Wei general Zhong Hui had Pang De&#x27;s body transported from Shu to Ye (鄴; in present-day Handan, Hebei) in Wei territory. Pang De seemed alive inside the tomb. However, Pei Songzhi, who annotated Pang De&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, dismissed this account as nonsense. He wrote: &quot;Pang De died in Fancheng. After Cao Pi ascended the throne, he sent an emissary to read out an imperial edict at Pang De&#x27;s tomb, so Pang&#x27;s body should not be in Shu. What Wang Yin wrote was nonsense.&quot;

== Appraisal ==
Chen Shou, the author of Records of the Three Kingdoms, has likened Pang De defiance towards Guan Yu with Zhou Kao, a minister of Liu Bang, who stands and defying Xiang Yu even when he facing death.

According to Fu Xuan, Jin dynasty historian and politician, there is record that before the battle of Tong Pass, or more known as battle of Weinan, against Cao Cao, Ma Chao and Pang De broke into a stable which contained hundred horses. Pang De were said taking the low quality horse while Ma Chao taken the finest horse, which caused Pang De being laughed at. However, it is said that Pang De horse were the fastest running during the battle of Tong Pass.

According to Longxi County Chronicle and Shanxi tong zhi (chronicle of Shanxi), there are &quot;White Horse General Temple&quot; on the top of Chishan Mountain which commemorate the bravery of two Chinese warrior, the first were Li Guang and the second are Pang De, whose bravery were praised well during the battle of Fancheng against Guan Yu.

==Descendants==
After Pang De&#x27;s death, two of his sons were granted marquis titles in recognition of their father&#x27;s contributions. When Cao Pi ascended the throne, he granted the title of a Secondary Marquis () to each of Pang De&#x27;s four sons and gave them each 100 taxable households as their marquisates. The names of Pang De&#x27;s sons were not recorded in history, except for one – Pang Hui ().

Pang Hui resembled his father in personality and served as a general in the Cao Wei state. The highest position he reached was Commandant-General of the Capital (). He was also enfeoffed as a marquis. The &quot;Shu Ji&quot; () recorded that he participated in the conquest of Wei&#x27;s rival state, Shu Han, in 263. After the fall of Shu, he exterminated Guan Yu&#x27;s family and descendants to avenge his father.

==In popular culture==
===In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;===
Pang De appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period.

==== Serving under Ma Chao ====
Pang De made his first appearance in chapter 58 as a trusted general under Ma Teng. At that time, Ma Teng had left Liang Province and travelled to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) while Ma Chao remained in the province. One night, Ma Chao had a dream about being attacked by a pack of tigers in a snowy land so he consulted his subordinates about it. Pang De told him that it was not a good omen. Later, Ma Chao received news that his father Ma Teng was lured into a trap in Xu and had been killed by Cao Cao&#x27;s men. This led to the Battle of Tong Pass, but in the novel, the order of events related to the battle had been reversed and some fictional stories were included.

Later, According to Zhang Chaoju, Pang De participated in Cao Cao campaign against Shu, where faced against Shu general named Wei Yan. Pang De managed to overpower Wei Yan in this battle and forced the latter to retreat.

====Battle of Fancheng====
Pang De&#x27;s role in the Battle of Fancheng (mentioned in chapter 70) was largely exaggerated for dramatic effect. Prior to the battle, Pang De volunteered to lead the vanguard of a reinforcement army to relieve Cao Ren&#x27;s forces, who were besieged in Fan by Guan Yu&#x27;s army. Cao Cao was delighted and he granted Pang De the post. However, when others advised Cao Cao against granting Pang De command of the vanguard due to Pang&#x27;s past associations with Ma Chao (who had become one of the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei), Pang knelt down in front of Cao and kowtowed until his face was covered in blood. Cao Cao was moved by Pang De&#x27;s sincerity and he no longer doubted Pang&#x27;s allegiance towards him, so he appointed Pang as the vanguard. Pang De later ordered a wooden coffin to be built and he told his men to place Guan Yu&#x27;s body inside if he succeeded in killing Guan, or place his body inside if he died in battle.

Before Pang De left to fight at the Battle of Fancheng, he told his wife to take care of their son, Pang Hui, and said that if he died, his son would avenge him in the future.

Pang De later engaged Guan Ping in a duel and neither of them managed to defeat his opponent after fighting for 30 rounds. The following day, he fought with Guan Yu but neither of them won after duelling for more than 100 rounds. Pang De later duelled with Guan Yu again and he feigned defeat and retreated after about 50 rounds. When Guan Yu pursued him, he suddenly turned around and fired an arrow, which hit Guan in the left arm. Pang De wanted to use the opportunity to attack but Yu Jin (who was his superior) stopped him.

The descriptions of Pang De&#x27;s final moments at the Battle of Fancheng were generally similar to those mentioned in his historical biography. He attempted to flee towards Cao Ren&#x27;s main camp on a small boat, but his boat was knocked over by a large raft steered by Guan Yu&#x27;s subordinate Zhou Cang. Pang De&#x27;s boat capsized and he fell into the water and was captured by Zhou Cang, who was a good swimmer. Before his death, Pang De refused to kneel before Guan Yu and he firmly rejected surrender, and was thus executed on Guan&#x27;s order. Guan Yu later pitied Pang De and had the latter properly buried.

=== Modern era depiction ===
Pang De is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series.

Pang De appears in Total War: Three Kingdoms, serving under Ma Teng&#x27;s faction.

<text>&quot;Alternate spellings include Wolfe, Wolff, Wulf and Wolf.&quot;

Woolf is a name that is used as a surname, given name, and a name among Germanic-speaking peoples: see Wolf, Wulf.
This name is particularly popular in England especially in the south due to strong Saxon influence: see Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. Historians on Anglo Saxon Britain such as Barbara Yorke, have commented that the Woolf name originated from Oswelf the &#x27;Wolf&#x27;, who was a famous Saxon lord who in legend fought King Horsa. He supposedly changed his name to &#x27;Woolf&#x27; from the more Germanic spelling of Wolf. This is the first recording of the Woolf name, although according to Yorke it is most likely that other Saxon families changed their name to this translation.

<text>Thad Eugene Starner is a founder and director of the Contextual Computing Group at Georgia Tech&#x27;s College of Computing, where he is a full professor. He is a pioneer of wearable computing as well as human-computer interaction, augmented environments, and pattern recognition. Starner is a strong advocate of continuous-access, everyday-use systems, and has worn his own customized wearable computer continuously since 1993. His work has touched on handwriting and sign-language analysis, intelligent agents and augmented realities. He also helped found Charmed Technology.

==Biography==
===Education===
Starner graduated from Dallastown Area High School in York PA in 1987 with honors. He won a talent show in technological science for one of the first AI puzzle-solving PC computer simulations in 1986 before high school graduation gaining him early recognition. Starner graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Brain and Cognitive Science (1991), a B.S. in Computer Science (1991), a M.S. in Media Arts and Science, and finally a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences (1999) from the MIT Media Laboratory. His doctoral work was entitled &quot;Wearable Computing and Contextual Awareness,&quot; dealing with pattern recognition and how wearable computing can be utilized for purposes such as recognizing hand motions used in American Sign Language.

===Wearable computing===
Starner is probably most well known for being a strong advocate for wearable computing. During his time at the MIT Media Lab, Starner, already responsible for helping create one of the earliest high-accuracy online cursive handwriting recognition systems in 1993 as an associate scientist with BBN&#x27;s Speech Systems Group, became one of the world&#x27;s leading experts on the subject. Starner is also a co-founder of the IEEE International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC) and co-founder and first member of the MIT Wearable Computing Project, where he was one of the first 6 cyborgs involved. Since 1993, Starner has been wearing his own customized wearable computer system full-time, arguably one of the longest, if not the longest, such instances. He designed the hardware for his system, dubbed &quot;The Lizzy&quot;, based on designs of the wearable &quot;hip PC&quot; designed by Doug Platt, who built Starner&#x27;s original wearable. The original system consisted of custom parts from a kit made by Park Enterprises, a Private Eye display, and a Twiddler chorded keyboard. As of January 29, 2008, Starner&#x27;s setup has evolved to include a heads-up display showing 640x480 screen resolution, a Twiddler, and an OQO Model 1 Ultra-Mobile PC (though the specifications listed suggest an OQO Model 01+) with a GHz processor, 512 MB of RAM, 30GB hard disk, USB2, Firewire, and Wi-Fi built in, as well as a mobile phone with cellular Internet access as well.

Some of the benefits he receives from wearing a computer include being able to type and access the Internet while walking around or talking to others, allowing him to take notes on a conversation in real-time, opening up notes on a certain subject and e-mailing them at any time or even having two conversations at once, one online and one face to face, and if he comes across something he doesn&#x27;t know or recognize, he can instantly find out. In addition to augmenting the outside world, having a computer on at all times improves Starner&#x27;s nerves while giving talks; Starner has a speech impediment but is able to speak more clearly when prompted by a computer.

Starner is a Technical Lead/Manager on Google&#x27;s Project Glass wearable computing project.

===Other research===
One of his prominent research focuses is the involvement of wearable computing with American Sign Language (ASL). His work intends to create a bridge between the deaf and hearing communities that will facilitate communication between the two using an ASL-to-English one-way translator. Starner is also researching dual-purpose speech, where a wearable computer will be able to interpret certain speech patterns and bring up appropriate programs, such as a calendar for scheduling appointments. In addition, Starner has been involved in the Aware Home project, which uses technology to create an interactive and personalizable environment within the home that would benefit individuals who wouldn&#x27;t normally be able to live independently.

Starner&#x27;s work has featured on CBS&#x27;s 60 Minutes, CNN, BBC, and The Wall Street Journal and has been demonstrated to a number of Fortune 500 companies including Merrill Lynch, IBM, and Motorola.

==Recognition==
Starner was listed among Technology Review&#x27;s TR100 top 100 remarkable innovators (now renamed TR35 and limited to thirty-five winners) in 1999. He was named as an ACM Fellow, in the 2024 class of fellows, &quot;for contributions to and leadership in the wearable computing research community&quot;.

<doc id="631350" wikidata="Q4115404" url="?curid=631350" title="Special Republican Guard (Iraq)">
<text>The Iraqi Special Republican Guard (SRG) (), also known as the Special Forces Brigade of the Presidential Palace, Republican Guard Special Protection Forces, or the Golden Division, was an elite praetorian guard unit founded in either early 1992 or March 1995 in Ba&#x27;athist-era Iraq. The Special Republican Guard was controlled by the Special Security Organization and tasked with protecting President Saddam Hussein, presidential sites, Baghdad, and responding to any rebellion, coup, or other threats to his power.

==History==
In order to prevent a coup d&#x27;état, Saddam Hussein forbade the Special Republican Guard (SRG) from coordinating with other forces, even the regular Republican Guard or any other units were ever allowed near the SRG.

The Special Republican Guard received better pay and benefits than members of the normal Republican Guard and the regular Iraqi Army. By 2002, there were reportedly 12,000 members of the SRG, drawn primarily from clans loyal to Saddam Hussein and his regime. As many as five brigades containing 14 battalions of 1,300–1,500 men each, and also included air defense, armored, and artillery were reported to be in existence at that time. In May 2003, the SRG was officially dissolved per Order 2 of the Coalition Provisional Authority under Administrator L. Paul Bremer, in the wake of the invasion of Iraq by a U.S.-led international coalition.

Former members of the Special Republican Guard were later suspected of carrying out insurgent attacks on Coalition forces in Iraq after the invasion, while others went on to join Sons of Iraq home guard militias, funded, trained, equipped and operated by American forces.

==Structure==
The SRG had 13 or 14 battalions and ranged in troop strength from 15,000 to 26,000. This may have fallen to only 12,000 by 2002.

<text>Robert Culliford (c. 1666 – unknown; last name occasionally reported as Collover) was a pirate from Cornwall who is best remembered for repeatedly &quot;checking the designs&quot; of Captain William Kidd.

==Early career and capture==
Culliford and Kidd first met as shipmates aboard the French privateer &quot;Sainte Rose&quot; in 1689; there were only six other Britons aboard. After the War of the Grand Alliance broke out, Kidd, Culliford, and their British comrades mutinied against a French prize crew, taking the ship from French Captain Jean Fantin and renaming it the &quot;Blessed William&quot;, with Kidd put in command. In February 1690, Culliford led his own mutiny and deprived Kidd of his command. The pirates elected William Mason as captain.

Culliford sailed with the pirates through the Caribbean, sacking ships and attacking a town. They went to New York to sell their booty. Mason was granted a letter of marque by Jacob Leisler, then acting governor of New York, and Culliford accompanied the pirates as they ransacked and laid waste two French Canadian towns. The pirates also captured a French frigate named &quot;L&#x27;Esperance&quot;. Mason granted this ship to Culliford, who renamed it the &quot;Horne Frigate&quot;, Culliford&#x27;s first pirate command. However, the pirates lost most of their booty when the two ketches they sent to bring their wealth to New York fell into the hands of French privateers. The disappointed Culliford returned to New York with Mason, where they returned aboard a single ship, the &quot;Jacob&quot;, another captured French vessel, and set sail in December 1690. Culliford served as captain&#x27;s quartermaster, one of two quartermasters aboard the &quot;Jacob&quot;.

Culliford and his fellow pirates eventually made their way to India, landing at Mangrol in 1692, where they robbed and abused the local population. The Gujaratis eventually captured Culliford and seventeen of his comrades, and Culliford spent the next four years in a Gujarati prison.

==Escape and new adventures==
In the spring of 1696, Culliford and some of his comrades escaped and made their way to Bombay, where they signed aboard the East India Company ketch &quot;Josiah&quot;. In Madras they commandeered the ship, returned to piracy, and sailed for the Bay of Bengal.

Near the Nicobar Islands, the crew retook the ship and marooned Culliford. He was rescued by Ralph Stout, captain of the &quot;Mocha&quot;. When Stout was killed in 1697, Culliford became captain, briefly sailing alongside the &quot;Charming Mary&quot; (formerly captained by Richard Glover, then Richard Bobbington, and later John Ireland). Cullingford then pursued the British ship &quot;Dorill&quot;, but the &quot;Dorill&quot; opened fire and severed the &quot;Mocha&quot; mainmast. Culliford retreated to St. Mary&#x27;s Island (Île Sainte-Marie) off eastern Madagascar, plundering ships along the way. At Saint Mary&#x27;s, Culliford plundered a French ship with £2,000 worth of cargo.

Meanwhile, William Kidd, hunting pirates, found Culliford at St. Mary&#x27;s Island. While plotting to capture Culliford&#x27;s ship most of Kidd&#x27;s crew (who had grown angry with their captain) abandoned Kidd and signed on with Culliford. Culliford and his new crew then set off in late June 1698, leaving Kidd and his ransacked ship to fend for themselves on St. Mary&#x27;s Island.

Shortly after departing Saint Mary&#x27;s Island, Culliford met up with Dirk Chivers. They joined forces with Joseph Wheeler and captured the &quot;Great Mohammed&quot; in the Red Sea in September 1698. The &quot;Great Mohammed&quot; carried £130,000 in cash. While returning to Saint Mary&#x27;s Island they plundered another ship in February 1699.

In June 1699 Culliford was living at Edward Welch settlement on Ile Ste. Marie near Madagascar with fellow Captain John Swann; while there, Swann was referred to as “a great consort of Culliford’s, who lives with him.” Because of this, Culliford is occasionally cited as a bisexual or homosexual pirate. But lack of evidence leaves the exact nature of their relationship unclear.

At St. Mary&#x27;s a number of his sailors elected to return to America, paying Giles Shelley to take them on as passengers aboard the &quot;Nassau&quot;. While at Saint Mary&#x27;s Island, four British warships under Commodore Thomas Warren arrived. The pirates were offered a royal pardon under the 1698 Act of Grace, which Culliford accepted despite its expiration. He was arrested despite the pardon, and taken to the Marshalsea prison on 1 August 1700. He was tried for piracy of the &quot;Great Mohammed&quot; and his pardon was ruled invalid. He was saved from hanging, because he was needed in Samuel Burgess&#x27; trial. Following the trial, Culliford disappeared from record, and rumour has it that he next served on a naval ship, after which he disappears from the records like another famous pirate - Henry Every.

<doc id="631354" wikidata="Q257940" url="?curid=631354" title="List of North Carolina state parks">
<text>The State of North Carolina has a group of protected areas known as the North Carolina State Park System, which is managed by the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation (NCDPR), an agency of the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (NCDNCR). Units of the system can only be established by an act of the General Assembly of North Carolina. The park system began in 1916 when the summit of Mount Mitchell became first state park in the Southeastern United States. According to the Division of Parks &amp; Recreation, &quot;the State Parks Act of 1987 lists six types of units included in the NC State Parks System.&quot; These are &quot;State Parks&quot;, &quot;State Recreation Areas&quot;, &quot;State Natural Areas&quot;, &quot;State Lakes&quot;, &quot;State Trails&quot;, and &quot;State Rivers&quot;. All units of the system are owned and/or managed by the division, and the division leases some of the units to other agencies for operation. Most units of the park system are also components of State Nature and Historic Preserve.

==State Parks==
&quot;State Parks&quot; are the principle unit of the state park system. The NC Division of Parks &amp; Recreation describes its parks as follows:

Generally, State Parks are expected to possess both significant natural resource values and significant recreational values. State Parks are expected to accommodate the development of facilities, but may vary in the extent of development depending upon what can be provided without damage to the scenic or natural features. Facilities are planned and constructed to keep disturbance of natural resources to a minimum and to leave a &quot;liberal portion&quot; of each park undisturbed and free from improvements and structures, except for trails.

Several of the State Parks are new and are still being planned and developed. A few of the older state parks were greatly expanded in size in the 2000s adding trails and bike paths open to the public.

==State Recreation Areas==
&quot;State Recreation Areas&quot; are more intensely developed units than State Parks, and they largely encompass lands less sensitive to human activities than State Parks. According to the NC Division of Parks &amp; Recreation:

State Recreation Areas are sites where the primary purpose is outdoor recreation, rather than preservation. More intensive development of facilities is provided than in State Parks. Protection and enjoyment of the natural resources are still important, and the sites are expected to contain scenic and attractive natural features. Development is planned and constructed to keep a &quot;reasonable amount&quot; of each area undisturbed and free from improvements and structures.

==State Natural Areas==
&quot;State Natural Areas&quot; protect areas more sensitive to human activities than State Parks. Most of the State Natural Areas are undeveloped and have limited to no facilities, and some of them are closed to the general public to protect rare, fragile ecosystems. A few have developed facilities for low intensity, passive recreation, as well as facilities for public interpretation and education of the natural area. The NC Division of Parks &amp; Recreation states:

The purpose of State Natural Areas is focused on preserving and protecting areas of scientific, aesthetic, or ecological value. Facilities are limited to those needed for interpretation, protection, and minimum maintenance. Generally, recreational and public use facilities such as camping, swimming, picnicking, and the like are not provided in State Natural Areas.

==State Lakes==
&quot;State Lakes&quot; are all large, naturally formed bodies of water in the state&#x27;s Coastal Plain. Most of the lakes are Carolina Bays. The NC Division of Parks &amp; Recreation describes its State Lakes as follows:

Chapter 165 of the Laws of 1929 specified that &quot;all lakes now belonging to the State having an area of 50 acres or more&quot; should be &quot;administered as provided for other recreational areas now owned by the State.&quot; This allowed the then-Department of Conservation and Development to assume management authority for seven Coastal Plain lakes that became units of the State Parks System known as State Lakes. Most of these are administratively included as part of an adjoining State Park, but one of the lakes (White Lake) has no public ownership on its shoreline.

==State Trails==
&quot;State Trails&quot; are one of the principal components of the State Trail System. State Trails may be either long-distance, hiking trails or paddle trails. State Trails may have land components for providing a trail corridor or for protecting significant features or resources along the trail. Most of these lands are leased to other land management agencies. All of the State Trails are joint projects with other government agencies and nonprofit organizations. The following is the NC Division of Parks &amp; Recreation description of State Trails:

The North Carolina Trails System Act was passed in 1973 to help provide for the state&#x27;s outdoor recreation needs and to promote public access to natural and scenic areas. The act prescribed methods for establishing a statewide system of scenic trails, recreation trails, and connecting or side trails. The Trails System includes &quot;park trails&quot;, which are designated and managed as units of the State Parks System known as State Trails, and &quot;designated trails&quot;, which are managed by other governmental agencies or corporations.


==State Rivers==
&quot;State Rivers&quot; are components of the state&#x27;s Natural and Scenic Rivers System, which is the state&#x27;s equivalent to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Most of the state&#x27;s National Wild and Scenic Rivers, are also State Rivers and vice versa. The NC Division of Parks &amp; Recreation states that:

The Natural and Scenic Rivers System was created by the 1971 General Assembly to preserve and protect certain free flowing rivers, their water quality and their adjacent lands for the benefit of present and future generations. The Natural and Scenic Rivers Act established criteria and methods for inclusion of components to the system. Components of the Natural and Scenic Rivers System are State Rivers, and are also units of the State Parks System.

==Former units==
Some units have been formally removed from the NC State Park System and transferred to other agencies for management.

When the State Historic Site system was established in 1955, the system&#x27;s first six components were historic properties transferred from the State Park System.

One unit, Rendezvous Mountain, was transferred back to the park system, after 66 years in the state forest system.

<doc id="631360" wikidata="Q3364033" url="?curid=631360" title="Cliffs of the Neuse State Park">
<text>Cliffs of the Neuse State Park is a North Carolina state park near Seven Springs, North Carolina, in Wayne County covering along the southern banks of the Neuse River. It has a swimming area, camp sites, hiking trails, fishing areas, and picnic areas. The park&#x27;s museum features exhibits about the geology and natural history of the cliffs and the park. Extending for , the series of cliffs rise above the water. Layers of sand, clay, seashells, shale and gravel form the multicolored cliff face, a rainbow of white, tan, yellow and brown.

==History==

The cliffs were formed when a fault in the Earth&#x27;s crust shifted millions of years ago. The Neuse River followed this fault line and, over time, cut its course through layers of sediment deposited by shallow seas that had earlier covered the coastal plain. A portion of the river took a bend against its bank and the water&#x27;s erosive action slowly carved Cliffs of the Neuse.

Much of the human history of the area centers around the river. The Tuscarora and Saponi Indian tribes once occupied much of the land between the Neuse and Pamlico rivers. What is now the park used to be a ceremonial ground and a gathering place for hunting expeditions. The river was also used for travel into the surrounding wilderness.

In 1944, local landowner Lionel Weil, a founder of Goldsboro&#x27;s historic Oheb Shalom synagogue and uncle of Gertrude Weil, proposed that the cliffs area along the Neuse River be preserved as a state park. The park was established in 1945 when land on the south side of the river was donated by Lionel Weil and other individuals through the Wayne Foundation. An additional contribution of approximately extended the boundary east of the river. Additional purchases and donations increased the park to its present size of .

== Wildlife ==

A range of habitats contributes to the variety of plants in the park. River margins, flood plains, rolling uplands and ravines are home to a large mixture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. More than 420 species of plants have been recorded in the park.

Opossums, raccoons, foxes, and squirrels are common in the campground and along hiking trails, while river otter and muskrat can be seen swimming along the waterways. Reptiles and amphibians are equally at home in the wetland and aquatic habitats. Most of the snakes are nonvenomous, although copperheads are present. Small nocturnal rodents and white-tailed deer live in the area but are discreet and seldom seen. Sightings of black bears and a coyote have taken place at the park.

Birds are abundant in the park during any season. The northern parula nests in clumps of Spanish moss while the prothonotary warbler lives along the river. Fall and winter bring a host of migratory waterfowl to the area to join the native wood duck.

<text>Crowders Mountain State Park is a North Carolina state park in Gaston County, North Carolina in the United States. It is near Kings Mountain, North Carolina and on the outskirts of Gastonia, North Carolina, it includes the peaks of Crowder&#x27;s Mountain and The Pinnacle. Crowders Mountain is named for Crowders Creek which originates near its base. The cliffs are a popular destination for rock climbers.

==Features==
The mountain itself is a monadnock, an isolated erosional remnant that rises abruptly from the surrounding plain. Geologically, Crowders Mountain and The Pinnacle are Class 6 mountains, defined as rising at least above the lowest point within a radius. Crowders Mountain sharply rises some above the surrounding countryside, and presents sheer rock cliffs that are 100 - in height. The mountain rises to above sea level, which is barely more than the above the surrounding terrain needed to qualify it as a true mountain, given that the lowest point within a radius is slightly less than above sea level and located along Crowders Creek between Dickey Mill Road and Superior Stainless Road. The peak is believed to be the remnant of a much higher mountain which formed some 400 - 500 million years ago and was gradually worn down by the elements. The park sets at the northeast end of the Kings Mountain Range, a long range of low peaks which include the site of the Battle of Kings Mountain of the American Revolution. The Pinnacle qualifies somewhat more solidly as a true mountain than Crowders Mountain does despite the lowest point within being more than (but still well under ) above sea level, owing to its higher overall elevation producing a more than elevation difference with the lowest nearby point along South Crowders Creek. 

The park contains two named peaks:
* Crowders Mountain, 1,625 feet (495 m), is in the northeastern section of the park. 
* The Pinnacle, 1,705 feet (520 m), is in the western section of the park. 

The park features a Visitors Center.

==History==
Buffalo herds grazed much of the land, which was prairie, before European settlers arrived. The Cherokee Indians had a trading route that crossed Crowders Mountain, and the peaks marked boundaries between the hunting lands of the Catawba and Cherokee Indians.

In the early 1970s, a mining company conducted exploratory sampling on the mountain as preparation to purchase the mineral rights. Thanks to grassroots efforts by local citizens, educational institutions, and organizations, the state government was convinced that the area should be set aside and protected due to significant natural communities, plants and animals, intrinsic beauty, and unique recreational opportunities. In 1973, the State of North Carolina officially designated the area as Crowders Mountain State Park, and it opened to the public in 1974. The Pinnacle was added to the park in 1987. Another was added in the year 2000 and officially connected the park with Kings Mountain State Park and Kings Mountain National Military Park, both in South Carolina.

==Trails==

Three hiking trails and one vehicle access trail lead to the summit of Crowders Mountain, and from the summit it is possible on a clear day to see the skyscrapers of Charlotte, North Carolina to the east.

* Crowders Trail - Strenuous, . This trail winds along the base of Crowders Mountain from the Visitor Center in the southwest and ultimately leads to the Backside Trail and the top of the mountain in the northeast of the park.
* Backside Trail - Strenuous, . From the Linwood Road Access Area this trail leads around the north side of the mountain where it first connects to the Crowders Trail and eventually to the top where it connects to the Rocktop Trail.
* Rocktop Trail - Strenuous, . Admittedly the most difficult and technical trail in the park. It travels along the ridge of Crowders Mountain from the southwest where it splits from the Crowders Trail at Sparrow Springs Road. Each side has steep drop offs and unseen cliffs.
* Tower Trail - Strenuous, . This trail begins at the Linwood Road Access Area and ends at the radio towers on Crowders Mountain. The trail is an old roadbed that begins with a gentle climb that becomes quite steep towards the end. Only official park vehicles can drive on this trail.

Two hiking trails lead to The Pinnacle.

* Pinnacle Trail - Strenuous, . This trail begins at the Visitor Center and moves southwest to end at the summit of The Pinnacle, the highest point in Gaston County at 1,705 feet.
* Ridgeline Trail - Strenuous, . Hikers must register before hiking this trail. The longest trail in the park, it starts below The Pinnacle off of Pinnacle Trail, following the ridgeline south all the way to the South Carolina State line. The Ridgeline trail then continues for 2.5 miles into South Carolina through Kings Mountain State Park, and terminates at the 16 mile Kings Mountain National Recreation Trail that goes through Kings Mountain State Park and Kings Mountain National Military Park.

Other park hiking trails.

* Family Camping Trail - Easy, . This trail is accessed from the Pinnacle Trail and gives campers access to the family backpack camping area.
* Group Camping Trail - Easy, . This trail is accessed from the Pinnacle Trail and gives campers access to the group backpack camping area.
* Fern Trail - Easy, . This loop trail begins at picnic shelter number 1, connects with a portion of the Turnback Trail and follows a creek for some portions of the trail.
* Lake Trail - Easy, . This loop trail circles the park lake and connects to Fern Trail.

<text>Eno River State Park is a North Carolina state park in Durham and Orange Counties, North Carolina. Together with the adjoining West Point on the Eno city park, the two parks preserve over 14 miles (22.5 km) of the Eno River and surrounding lands.

There are five public access areas with features including twenty-four miles of hiking trails, canoe launches, picnic areas, and historic structures.

==Trails==
===Buckquarter Creek===
Beginning at the parking lot for the Piper-Cox Museum, the Buckquarter Creek Trail goes up the river at Few&#x27;s Ford. A staircase takes visitors to a view of the Eno River rapids down below. This loop is marked by red blazes. Holden Mill loop and the Ridge Trail branch off from the Buckquarter Creek Trail.

===Cabelands===
The Cabelands Trail is long and is marked by red blazes. The trail passes through the few remains of the Cabe Mill. The stretch of the river is very rocky and is usually known as Cabe&#x27;s Gorge.
===Cox Mountain===
The Cox Mountain Trail is marked by blue blazes. The trail passes a picnic area and crosses the suspension foot bridge. The trail goes up in elevation and at one point follows Hillsborough Coach Road. When getting closer to Cox Mountain, the trail can get fairly steep. The trail connects to Fanny&#x27;s Ford trail.

===Eno Quarry===
Eno Quarry Trail is marked by blue blazes and is a loop. In the 1960s, stone was removed from the Eno Quarry Trail to aid in construction of Interstate 85. The quarry is now the site of a pond. The trail has several spots that are good for fishing.

===Eno Trace===
Eno Trace is a nature trail with several information kiosks pointing out wildlife. There is a short set of steps and at one point the trail follows alongside the river.

===Fanny&#x27;s Ford===
Fanny&#x27;s Ford Trail is a loop and is mostly made up of flat ground and gentle hills. The trail is around the Cox Mountain trail and Hillsborough Coach Road, and at one point passes through the Few Mill&#x27;s race. The trail is marked by purple blazes.

===Holden Mill===
The Holden Mill trail is a combination of two loops and is long. The larger eastern loop follows the river bank for almost a mile, before climbing a rise in elevation. The smaller loop is a hike around the remains of Holden&#x27;s Mill, but also follows the river at parts. It is marked by yellow blazes.

===Shakori===
The Shakori Trail is a scenic hike marked by yellow U-shaped blazes. Hikers can view the remains of a 19th-century house and an old saw mill site. There is a elevation change. 

===Laurel Bluffs===
This trail starts at an intersection with the Pump Station Trail and goes east to Guess Road. It is long and generally stays close to the river except for short sections where cliffs and bluffs force it up and around on ridges. The trail passes the chimney and foundation of an old hunting lodge, the mostly-intact Guess Mill Dam, enters the millrace and comes out at the chimney at the Guess Mill site. Future plans are for Laurel Bluffs Trail to extend west to Cabelands Trail and to connect with West Point on the Eno city park trails. This connection will be a component of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail.

===Pump Station===
The Pump Station Trail is known as the best spring wildflower trail in the park. It begins at the Nancy Rhodes Creek bridge on Rivermont Road and makes a loop. It is generally an easy hike with only a few gentle hills. The foundations of Durham’s first water pumping station are near the river at the northeast section of the loop.

==History==
Native Americans of the Eno, Shakori and Occoneechee tribes lived along the river prior to European settlement. Some of the tribes merged in the late 17th century and established a village near present-day Durham.

Settlers moved to the area later to set up farms and gristmills. More than thirty mills were located on the Eno River. By the 1940s the last of the mills ceased operations.

Efforts to protect the Eno River started in 1965 when the city of Durham proposed building a reservoir in the river valley. Margaret Nygard, a British resident of the area, rallied concerned citizens to campaign and save the Eno. They formed the Association for the Preservation of the Eno River Valley, typically known as the Eno River Association. The association proposed the establishment of a state park and after battling with developers and planners for nearly a decade, the state of North Carolina approved the idea in 1973. In 1975, the state—with help from the Eno River Association and the Nature Conservancy—acquired more than 1,000 acres (4 km²) of land for the park.

==The Eno River Association==
The Eno River Association was established in 1966 and played an important role in creating the park. Since its inception it has purchased more than 4900 acres (20 km²) for the park. As a part of its conservation role the group engages in public outreach, notably producing the annual Festival for the Eno.

The Festival for the Eno brings an average 30,000 visitors during three days in July. The festival includes music, crafts, food, and promotes environmental awareness. The proceeds are a major source of funding for the Eno River Association.

<doc id="631363" wikidata="Q5432484" url="?curid=631363" title="Falls Lake State Recreation Area">
<text>Falls Lake State Recreation Area is a North Carolina state park in Durham and Wake counties, North Carolina in the United States. Near Wake Forest, North Carolina, it covers along the shores of Falls Lake.

==History==
Prior to 1978, flooding of the Neuse River caused extensive damage to public and private properties including roadways, railroads, industrial sites and farmlands. The Falls Lake Project was developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers to control damaging floods. Construction of the dam began in 1978 and was completed in 1981. In addition to recreation opportunities, Falls Lake now provides flood and water-quality control, water supply, and fish and wildlife conservation.

In 1992, the NC Division of Parks and Recreation took control of the James Mangum House as part of Beaverdam Recreation Area.

Rock Cliff Farm is owned by the federal government, and part of a large acreage managed by the state of North Carolina as the Falls Lake State Recreation Area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

== Hiking ==

Falls Lake hiking trails on the south side are part of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail which stretches from Kuwohi in the Great Smoky Mountains to Jockey&#x27;s Ridge State Park on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

Camping along the Falls Lake portion of the trail is only available at Shinleaf Recreation Area in Wake County and Rolling View Recreation Area in Durham County. Trails are easy to moderate on some steep ridges.

== Mountain biking ==
The Beaver Dam bike trails at Falls Lake are easy to intermediate and have trails for everyone. Trail heads are accessible from the park entrance at Beaverdam Recreation Area only.

== Kayak and canoeing ==

Falls Lake is accessible by kayaks and canoes from two boat launches at Highway 50 and Beaver Dam Lake.

==In literature==

Falls Lake is one of the settings in the spy thriller novel &quot;Crisis Four&quot; by Andy McNab.

<doc id="631364" wikidata="Q1209648" url="?curid=631364" title="Dick Ebersol">
<text>Duncan Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Ebersol (; born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports &amp; Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large-scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts.

==Early life==
Ebersol was born in Torrington, Connecticut, the son of Mary (née Duncan) and Charles Roberts Ebersol, a former chairman of the American Cancer Society. He and Josiah Bunting III are half-brothers. In 1967, aged 20, Ebersol began his long history with the Olympics when he temporarily dropped out of Yale University to join Roone Arledge and ABC Sports as television&#x27;s first-ever Olympic researcher.

==Career==
===Move to NBC===
In 1974, he joined NBC as Director of Weekend Late Night Programming. In 1975, at the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller, Ebersol and NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached Lorne Michaels for help in creating a show to fill the Saturday night time slot. Michaels&#x27;s idea for a variety show featuring high-concept comedy sketches, political satire, and music performances eventually became &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Named as Vice President of Late Night Programming at age 28, Ebersol became NBC&#x27;s first vice president under the age of 30. After a brief departure, he returned to &quot;SNL&quot; in 1981 as executive producer and remained until 1985, spanning the Eddie Murphy and Billy Crystal eras. In 1983, Ebersol formed No Sleep Productions, an independent production company that created Emmy Award-winning NBC shows &quot;Friday Night Videos&quot; and &quot;Later with Bob Costas&quot;. Together with Vince McMahon, Ebersol produced &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot;. When Ebersol left &quot;SNL&quot; in 1985, he devoted his time to his production company until rejoining NBC in 1989. He served as senior vice president of NBC News.

===NBC Sports===
Ebersol became president of NBC Sports in 1989, and was promoted to chairman, NBC Sports &amp; Olympics in June 1998. He served as executive producer for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, his first Olympics since Munich in 1972 for ABC.

His early tenure at NBC Sports was highlighted by a string of sports-property acquisitions and renewals, including the NFL, NBA, Notre Dame football and MLB, through the formation of the joint-venture Baseball Network. During the 1995–96 television season, for the only time in history, the World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals and Summer Olympics were telecast by the same network. It was following this run in 1996 that &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Ebersol the &quot;Most Powerful Person in Sports.&quot; By January 1998, NBC had become the home of four Super Bowls in six years.

In 1993, he secured the rights to the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics.

In August 1995, he acquired the rights for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. It marked the first time that rights for consecutive Olympics were awarded at the same time. Later that same year, he spearheaded NBC Sports&#x27; acquisition of the exclusive media rights for the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics, and the 2006 Winter Olympics. The agreements marked the first time that the same network had been awarded the rights to five consecutive Olympics.

In 2003, Ebersol led NBC to acquire the exclusive U.S. media rights to the 2010 Winter Games and the 2012 Summer Olympics. In December 2003, Ebersol agreed to a nine-year contract to continue running NBC Sports &amp; Olympics through 2012. He assumed the title as Chairman of NBC Universal Sports &amp; Olympics in May 2004 when NBC and Universal merged.

Ebersol produced:
* the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 (the most-watched event in U.S. television history with a record 215 million viewers)
* the Vancouver Olympic Winter Games in 2010 (second-most watched Winter Olympics in history with 190 million viewers)
* Super Bowl XLIII in February 2009 produced, at the time, the largest-single audience in U.S. television history with a record 152 million viewers.

It is currently the second-most viewed program of all time. The Super Bowl milestone was made possible in 2005 when Ebersol spearheaded the effort to return the NFL to NBC by negotiating a six-year agreement that included moving the NFL primetime broadcast package from Monday night to Sunday night, flexible scheduling for the first time ever, and Super Bowls in 2009 and 2012.

On May 19, 2011, Ebersol resigned from NBC Sports. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that he intended to stay at NBC through the end of June 2011. It was later reported that Ebersol would return to NBC Sports in time for the beginning of the 2011 NFL season to serve in a senior adviser role.

===Alliance of American Football===
Ebersol served on the board of directors of the Alliance of American Football (AAF), a professional American football league co-founded by his son Charlie and Bill Polian. Ebersol and his son were both ousted from the board of directors when Thomas Dundon purchased the league.

===Awards and honors===
Ebersol has often been in the top 10 honorees on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ annual list of the 100 most powerful sports figures, including in 1996 when he was named the Most Powerful Person in Sports. In 1992, Ebersol was awarded the Olympic Order, an honor periodically bestowed by the International Olympic Committee to recognize remarkable contributions to the Olympic Movement.

In 2005, Ebersol was inducted into both the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame and the Broadcasting &amp; Cable Hall of Fame.

<text>Fort Fisher State Recreation Area is a North Carolina state park in New Hanover County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Kure Beach, North Carolina, it includes Fort Fisher, site of a major naval engagement during the American Civil War. The recreation area also served as a home for the Fort Fisher Hermit, Robert Harrill. Harrill lived in a bunker and shared his beliefs about &quot;common sense&quot; with thousands of visitors every year while surviving on what he could gather from the surrounding salt marsh and oyster beds.

Today, the recreation area consists of the remains of the earthen Fort Fisher and a museum at Fort Fisher State Historic Site, an oceanfront beach pavilion, a large lagoon popular with windsurfers, and a long stretch of beach that is accessible only by four-wheel drive vehicles. The beach is an important nesting ground for sea turtles, and state park rangers regularly patrol the beach to identify recently built turtle nests. Once they are identified, they are clearly marked and surrounded with a mesh fence to prevent vehicles from driving over the eggs. The openings in the mesh are large enough to allow newly hatched turtles to pass through and return to the sea.

==History==

The city of Wilmington on the Cape Fear River was an important port of entry for the Confederacy during the Civil War. And, by late 1864, it was the last southern port open to trade. Fort Fisher, built in 1861, served to protect this valuable port from Union ships. In 1864, the first of two Union attacks on Fort Fisher took place. The fort held strong during the first battle and Union forces withdrew, but the Confederacy was not so fortunate the next time. The First Battle of Fort Fisher, during the American Civil War, was the largest naval bombardment and land-sea battle fought in any war up to that time.

In early 1865, a fleet of 56 ships bombarded the fort prior to a land assault by a force of more than 3,300 infantry. Fort Fisher was captured and the Confederate supply line was broken. Approximately three months after the fall of Fort Fisher, the Civil War came to an end.

In the late 19th century, a long rock jetty called &quot;The Rocks&quot; was built west of Fort Fisher to aid navigation by stopping shoaling in the Cape Fear River. Completed in 1881, The Rocks closed the former New Inlet, once used by Confederate blockade-runners to avoid the U.S. Navy, and created a lagoon, now called &quot;The Basin&quot;. Today, The Rocks and The Basin are part of the Zeke&#x27;s Island component of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, an area of outstanding estuarine and ocean resources with extensive marshes and tidal flats.

During World War II a series of concrete fortifications was built along the coast of North Carolina. A grass landing strip was built through the earthworks of the fort, and it was used to resupply aircraft that patrolled the coast. The Fort Fisher visitor center was built in the middle of the landing strip, and the north end of the landing strip was paved for the visitor center parking lot. The outline of the original landing strip is still clearly visible, especially when viewed from aerial photos.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, beach erosion continued to wear away at the coastline near the fort. Much of the civil war era fort was lost to the sea. In 1999, construction began on a large seawall to prevent the fort from further erosion. The seawall was controversial because they tend to shift erosion to other parts of the beach, however it was completed in 2000 and it effectively stopped erosion in the area of the fort.

<doc id="631366" wikidata="Q3364042" url="?curid=631366" title="Fort Macon State Park">
<text>Fort Macon State Park is a North Carolina state park in Carteret County, North Carolina, in the United States. Located on Bogue Banks near Atlantic Beach, the park opened in 1936. Fort Macon State Park is the second most visited state park in North Carolina, with an annual visitation of 1.3 million, despite being one of the smallest state parks in North Carolina with . Fort Macon was built as part of the Third System of US fortifications, and was preceded by Fort Hampton of the Second System.

The Battle of Fort Macon was fought there during March and April 1862.

In addition to the fully restored fort, the park offers visitors both soundside and surf fishing, nature trails, ranger guided tours, a protected swim area, a refreshment stand, and a bathhouse. The park is open year-round, but during the non-summer months the protected swimming area, refreshment stand, and bathhouse are not available.

Fort Macon State Park also surrounds United States Coast Guard Station Fort Macon. The main gate is located directly across from the park office and barracks.

==History==

Five-sided Fort Macon is constructed of brick and stone. Twenty-six vaulted rooms (also called casemates) are enclosed by outer walls that are thick.
In modern times, the danger of naval attack along the North Carolina coast seems remote, but during the 18th and 19th centuries the region around Beaufort was highly vulnerable to attack.

Blackbeard and other infamous pirates were known to have passed through Beaufort Inlet at will, while successive wars with Spain, France and Great Britain during the Colonial Period provided a constant threat of coastal raids by enemy warships. Blackbeard&#x27;s ship, the Queen Anne&#x27;s Revenge &quot;QAR&quot; is thought to have been discovered in shallow water right off the park in the Atlantic Ocean and is being recovered. Beaufort was captured and plundered by the Spanish in 1747 and again by the British in 1782.

===Fortifications===
North Carolina leaders recognized the need for coastal defenses to prevent such attacks and began efforts to construct forts. The eastern point of Bogue Banks was determined to be the best location for a fort to guard the entrance to Topsail inlet now identified as the Beaufort Inlet. In 1756 construction of Fort Dobbs began. Fort Dobbs was commissioned as a small fascine fort but was never fully completed leaving the Topsail inlet undefended during the American Revolution. During the same time frame and with an escalating Indian War on the western frontier of North Carolina; another fortification was being constructed in the piedmont region of the state near Statesville, North Carolina. Fort Dobbs was constructed to specifically provide defense on the edge of the western frontier during the French and Indian War.
====Second System====

The Embargo Act of 1807 was a general embargo enacted by the United States Congress against Great Britain and France for actions during the Napoleonic Wars under Great Britain&#x27;s Orders in Council (1807), and the second attempt at building a fort to protect the town and port at Beaufort, North Carolina began as a part of the United States Government&#x27;s program to build a national defense chain of coastal fortifications. This program was later called the Second System of US fortifications. Thus construction began on Fort Hampton, a small masonry fort with a horseshoe-shaped parapet facing the channel. The parapet was seven feet high and made using oyster shell cement called tabby, or tapia. The parapet wall was fourteen feet thick at its base, tapering down to eight feet as the wall rose to its top. Located behind the parapet was a gun platform 23 feet wide where there were to be five 18-pounder cannons mounted. Each cannon could fire an 18-pound iron shot with an estimated effective range of just under one mile.

At the rear of this fort at the two prongs of the horseshoe were located, the walls were eighteen inches thick at the top and were loopholed for riflemen to fire their rifles through. Connecting the two prongs and enclosing the fortification&#x27;s rear was a two-story barracks roughly 82 feet long and 30 feet wide. Each story contained five 13×16-foot rooms, three laid out for enlisted men and two for the fort&#x27;s officers. The barracks could accommodate a single company consisting of fifty men. Beside the barracks on the right-hand prong was a small 15×16-foot brick building for a gunpowder magazine. From rear wall to front the fort was 90 feet long, 123 feet wide and had a perimeter of about 440 feet.

In July, the United States engaged in the War of 1812 and Fort Hampton&#x27;s soldiers withdrew the fort&#x27;s garrison to other service for the war. However, North Carolina Governor William Hawkins ordered four local militia companies to occupy the fort and the surrounding harbor area in anticipation of an English attack. When no attack ensued, the militia was withdrawn until November 1812 when the 10th US Infantry was garrisoned there and remained for 9 months until reassigned in June 1813. In July 1813 the British assaulted Ocracoke Inlet at which time North Carolina Militia was re-instated to protect Beaufort and the interests of the state. The fort&#x27;s armament was increased with the addition of two 6-pounders and a 4-pounder cannon to supplement the main battery of 18-pounders cannon already in place at the fort. In 1814 after much internal struggle the State of North Carolina convinced the United States Department of War to secure the fort with Federal Troops. The War Department garrisoned elements of the 43rd US Infantry where they remained until the end of the war.

====Third System====
By 1820 and 1821 engineers surveying the fort noted that the high tide mark had advanced to the point of lapping the base of the fort&#x27;s rounded front. Still, there was limited interest in Fort Hampton because by now the federal government had begun the construction of a chain of permanent forts for a new system of Seacoast defense in the United States known as the Third System. Fort Hampton for reasons of an eroding facade and beach at Bogue Point. During a survey in February, 1826, the high tide mark lay over 200 feet to the rear of the spot where Fort Hampton stood. By 1834, Fort Hampton lay in now Beaufort inlet along the line of a 12-foot deep ship channel.

Initially the new fort at Bogue Point was designated by the engineers to be 130 feet SW of Fort Hampton, by 1826 with Fort Hampton in the channel, the US Army Corps of Engineers elected to move 300 yards west of Fort Hampton where Fort Macon now stands.

The War of 1812 demonstrated the weakness of existing coastal defenses of the United States coastline and prompted the United States government to develop an improved coastal defenses through a chain of coastal fortifications. The present fort, Fort Macon, was a part of this chain. Fort Macon&#x27;s purpose was to guard Beaufort Inlet and Beaufort Harbor, North Carolina&#x27;s only major deepwater ocean port.

Named after a U.S. Senator from the State of North Carolina, Nathaniel Macon, who procured the funds to build the facility, Fort Macon was designed by Brig. Gen. Simon Bernard and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers. Construction began in 1826 and lasted eight years, under the Third System of US fortifications. The fort was completed in December, 1834, and it was improved with further modification during 1841–46. The total cost of the fort was $463,790. In the 1840s, a system of erosion control was initially engineered by Robert E. Lee, who later became general of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. At the beginning of the Civil War, North Carolina seized the fort from Union forces. The fort was later attacked in 1862, and it fell back into Union hands. For the duration of the war, the fort was a coaling station for navy ships. Often an ordnance sergeant acting as a caretaker was the only person stationed at the fort.

===Civil War===
The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, and only two days elapsed before local North Carolina militia forces from Beaufort arrived to seize the fort for the state of North Carolina and the Confederacy. North Carolina Confederate forces occupied the fort for a year, preparing it for battle and arming it with 54 heavy cannons.

Early in 1862, Union forces commanded by Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside swept through eastern North Carolina, and part of Burnside&#x27;s command under Brig. Gen. John G. Parke was sent to capture Fort Macon. Parke&#x27;s men captured Morehead City and Beaufort without resistance, then landed on Bogue Banks during March and April to fight to gain Fort Macon. Col. Moses J. White and 400 North Carolina Confederates in the fort refused to surrender even though the fort was hopelessly surrounded. On April 25, 1862, Parke&#x27;s Union forces bombarded the fort with heavy siege guns for 11 hours, aided by the fire of four Union gunboats in the ocean offshore and floating batteries in the sound to the east.
While the fort easily repulsed the Union gunboat attack, the Union land batteries, utilizing new rifled cannons, hit the fort 560 times. There was such extensive damage that Col. White was forced to surrender the following morning, April 26, with the fort&#x27;s Confederate garrison being paroled as prisoners of war. This battle was the second time in history new rifled cannons were used against a fort, demonstrating the obsolescence of such fortifications as a way of defense. The Union held Fort Macon for the remainder of the war, while Beaufort Harbor served as an important coaling and repair station for its navy.

===Post-Civil War===

During the Reconstruction Era, the US Army actively occupied Fort Macon until 1877. During this time, because there were no state or federal penitentiaries in the military district of North Carolina and South Carolina, Fort Macon was used for about 11 years as a civil and military prison. The fort was deactivated after 1877 only to be garrisoned by state troops once again during the summer of 1898 for the Spanish–American War. Finally, in 1903, the US Army completely abandoned the fort.

In 1923, Fort Macon was offered for sale as surplus military property. However, at the bidding of North Carolina leaders, a Congressional Act on June 4, 1924, sold the fort and surrounding reservation for the sum of $1 to the state of North Carolina to be used as a public park. This was the second area acquired by the state for the purpose of establishing a state parks system.

During 1934–35, the Civilian Conservation Corps restored the fort and established public recreational facilities, which enabled Fort Macon State Park to officially open May 1, 1936, as North Carolina&#x27;s first functioning state park.

At the outbreak of World War II, the US Army leased the park from the state and actively manned the old fort with Coast Artillery troops to protect a number of important nearby facilities. The fort was occupied from December 1941 to November 1944. During the occupation some unsuspecting soldiers rolled cannonballs into the fireplaces as andirons, mistaking them for solid iron shot. The powder-filled balls exploded, killing two men and injuring others- thus firing the &quot;last shot of the Civil War&quot;. On October 1, 1946, the Army returned the fort and the park to the state. A conclusive history of Fort Macon and Fort Macon State Park can be found in Paul R. Branch Jr&#x27;s book, &quot;Fort Macon: A History&quot;. (). Paul R. Branch is Fort Macon&#x27;s on-site historian and has been part of the Park Ranger staff for over 20 years.

Management of Fort Macon was changed in 1950 from a caretaker to its first superintendent, Walter Douglas Starr, who served from 1950-1952.

<text>Goose Creek State Park is a North Carolina state park near Washington, Beaufort County, North Carolina in the United States. It covers just off of Pamlico Sound, in North Carolina&#x27;s Coastal Plain. Goose Creek State Park is home to a wide variety of wildlife that make their homes in the extensive salt water marshes, inlets and creeks on the northern side of the sound. Goose Creek State Park is open for year-round recreation, east of Washington, two miles (3 km) south of U.S. Route 264 on Camp Leach Road.

==History==
The land in and surrounding Goose Creek State Park has long provided an abundance of natural resources for the people of the area. The first recorded inhabitants of the area were members of the Secota and the Pamlico, two Eastern Woodlands tribes. They were victims of widespread disease brought to colonial North Carolina by settlers from Europe during the 17th century. Most of the Indians that did not succumb to disease were killed or driven off during the Tuscarora War (1711–1715). Goose Creek and Pamlico Sound also provided shelter for pirates such as Blackbeard and Stede Bonnet.

Since the end of the pirate era, the area in and surrounding Goose Creek State Park has been centered on timber production, commercial fishing and small scale, subsistence farming. Lumber companies, such as the Eureka Lumber Company and later Weyerhauser Corporation, acquired extensive tracts of land along the creeks and harvested vasts stands of old growth bald cypress and longleaf pine. Much of the land that is now part of Goose Creek State Park was clear cut. Evidence of the timber industry remains at the park today. Visitors to the park can see the remains of piers and loading docks up and down Goose Creek and an old railroad bed crosses the park.

After the lumber companies had cleared the forests and left the land, citizens of Beaufort County sought to have the land along Goose Creek protected under North Carolina state law. At this time the state was looking for land along the Pamlico River on which to build a park. It was soon determined that Goose Creek would be an ideal setting for a state park. Local citizens showed their support for the effort by sending a resolution to North Carolina governor, James Holshouser. The state purchased 1,208 (4.88 km2) acres of land, at a cost of $1,115,000 from Weyerhauser, for the park and Goose Creek State Park was opened to the public in September 1974.

In 1980, Goose Creek State Park Natural Area was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

==Recreation==
Goose Creek State Park is open for year-round recreation offering camping, boating, fishing, hiking, swimming, picnicking, and environmental education.

===Boating and fishing===
A boat ramp is on the west shore of Goose Creek at Dinah&#x27;s Landing. Motorboating, sailing and windsurfing are all permitted at the park. All boaters must follow the rules and regulations of the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission. Visitors that are interested in exploring the creeks of the park in canoes must bring their own. Access to the creeks is provided at Dinah&#x27;s Landing and near the campground. The streams of the park offer opportunities for canoeists to view a wide variety of wading birds that make the park their home.

Fishing is permitted in the waters of Goose Creek State Park. The most popular species of game fish are white and yellow perch, largemouth bass and bluegill.

===Camping and hiking===
The campground at Goose Creek State Park is located on a stretch of land between Goose Creek and Flatty Creek. It is a primitive campground with twelve tent sites. The campground is in a grove of longleaf pines that are covered with Spanish moss.

Goose Creek State Park is home to six hiking trails.

Flatty Creek Trail is a one-mile (1.6 km) loop trail that begins and ends at the parking area near the campground. Much of the trail is on boardwalks over the fresh water and brackish water wetlands of the park.

Goose Creek Trail is a 1.9-mile (3.06-km) trail that passes through a cypress swamp.

Ivey Gut Trail runs from the main park road to the campground through two miles (3.22 km) of forest.

Live Oak Trail is a 0.4-mile (0.64-km) trail that passes an old cemetery.

Palmetto Boardwalk Trail is a 0.7-mile (1.13-km) boardwalk trail that connects the Environmental Education Center with the Ivey Gut Parking area, passing through a hardwood swamp.

Mallard Creek Trail is a 1.26 (2.03 km) trail that follows Mallard Creek and an overlook that offers a view of the Pamlico River.

===Picnicking and swimming===
There are two pavilions at Goose Creek State Park and several picnic tables in a pine and oak forest near the swimming area. The swimming area is on a sandy beach along the Pamlico River on the southern side of the park.

==Ecology==
Goose Creek State Park is home to a wide variety of plant and animal species that thrive in the various habitats in place at the park. Sedges, sawgrass and black needle rush can be found in the brackish marshes near the Pamlico River. These tall grasses provide cover and nesting sites for the many wading birds of the park, including, marsh wren, rails, herons and egrets.

The marshes of the park recede in swamps. These swamps are home to bald cypress, loblolly pine and red cedar trees. Many of the trees are covered in Spanish moss. The swamps are home to a wide variety of wildlife including barred owls, frogs, turtles, snakes, minks, turkeys, muskrats and raccoons. Larger animals include white-tailed deer, bobcats, black bear and gray foxes.

The waters of Goose Creek and the Pamlico River are visited by a wide variety of migratory birds. Tundra swans and Canada geese winter at the park as do bufflehead, mallard and wood ducks.
