<doc id="616564" wikidata="Q233819" url="?curid=616564" title="Johan Neeskens">
<text>Johannes Jacobus Neeskens (; 15 September 1951 – 6 October 2024) was a Dutch football manager and player. A midfielder, he was an important member of the Netherlands national team that finished as runners-up in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups and is considered one of the greatest midfielders of all time. In 2004, he was named one of the 125 Greatest Living Footballers at a FIFA Awards Ceremony, while in 2017 he was included in the &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; list of the 100 all-time greatest players, at the 64th position.

After his retirement in 1991, Neeskens was assistant manager to Guus Hiddink with the Dutch and Australian national teams, and to Frank Rijkaard for the Netherlands, Barcelona and Galatasaray. He was also head coach of NEC Nijmegen, the Netherlands B national team, and Mamelodi Sundowns.

==Early life==
Neeskens was born in Heemstede in North Holland on 15 September 1951. In his childhood, marked by his parents&#x27; divorce, he slept in a corridor due to lack of space.

Neeskens was gifted at sports as a child, including gymnastics and baseball. He represented the Netherlands at a youth European Championship in the latter sport.

==Club career==
Neeskens started his career at Racing Club Heemstede in 1968, before being spotted by Rinus Michels and signed for Ajax in 1970. The youngster impressed at right-back, playing in that position for Ajax in the 1971 European Cup Final win against Panathinaikos. During the 1971–72 season, Neeskens took up more of a central midfield role, in support of Johan Cruyff. He adapted well to his new central midfield role because he was a tireless runner, had great technical skills and scored his fair share of goals. Ajax completed a hat-trick of European Cup wins between 1971 and 1973, and Neeskens moved on to FC Barcelona in 1974 to join Cruyff and Michels. There he was nicknamed &quot;Johan Segon&quot; (&quot;Johan the Second&quot;).

While his time at Barcelona was relatively unsuccessful for the club (one cup title in 1978, and the 1979 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup), he was hugely popular amongst the fans. In 1979 he accepted an offer from the New York Cosmos, spending five years at the club. He earned the equivalent of 600,000 Dutch guilders (roughly $300,000) per year at the club. Having been absent without reason for the third time, he was given a nine-month suspension by manager Hennes Weisweiler in late 1980. The Cosmos released him in October 1984. He also played for FC Groningen during the 1984–85 season. In June 1985, he signed with the South Florida Sun of the United Soccer League. The USL collapsed six games into the 1985 season. On 15 August 1985, he signed with the Kansas City Comets of the Major Indoor Soccer League.

Neeskens then played for FC Baar (1988–90) and FC Zug in Switzerland, finally retiring in 1991.

==International career==

Neeskens was capped 49 times for the Netherlands national team, scoring 17 goals. He made his debut against East Germany in 1970, and played a crucial role in the 1974 and 1978 FIFA World Cups, playing in central midfield.

In 1974 World Cup qualification, Neeskens scored a hat-trick in a 9–0 win over Norway and also neutralised the attacking threat of Paul Van Himst against Belgium; the latter performance was criticised as a &quot;disgrace&quot; in Dutch newspaper &quot;de Volkskrant&quot; for having committed 13 fouls. At the tournament in West Germany, he scored two penalties against Bulgaria, and a goal in a 2–0 win over reigning champions Brazil to put the Netherlands into the final. Neeskens scored the opening goal of the 1974 World Cup final against West Germany with a penalty kick after only two minutes of play.

Four years later, Neeskens was a crucial player for the Netherlands (despite a rib injury suffered in the Scotland defeat), in the absence of Cruyff who had retired from international football in 1977. The Netherlands again reached the final, only to lose again to the host nation, this time Argentina, going down 3–1 after extra time (the score at the end of regulation was 1–1).

Neeskens&#x27;s international appearances were fewer in number after he moved to the New York Cosmos. He declined the key UEFA Euro 1980 qualifier against East Germany in November 1979, citing physical and emotional exhaustion. After his nine-month ban for club absences was lifted, he was reintroduced to the national squad by manager Kees Rijvers in late 1981 for two qualifiers to the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He was cheered in a 3–0 home win over Belgium, but the team lost 2–0 away to France in his final game and missed out on the final tournament.

==Coaching career==
Guus Hiddink appointed Neeskens as assistant coach for the Netherlands in 1995. They led the team at the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He remained in the role under successor Frank Rijkaard, who led the national team in its co-hosting of Euro 2000. In 2000 he was appointed coach of Dutch side NEC Nijmegen, leading them to their first European appearance in twenty years in 2003, but was fired in December 2004 with the team in 14th place.

In December 2005, Neeskens was appointed assistant coach of the Australia national team, once again at the request of Guus Hiddink, the &quot;Socceroos&quot;&#x27;s manager. He worked alongside Hiddink and Graham Arnold as part of their World Cup 2006 campaign, and was desired by Football Australia to replace Russia-bound Hiddink after the tournament.

After the 2006 World Cup, Neeskens returned to FC Barcelona to replace Henk ten Cate in the club&#x27;s technical staff, reuniting with Rijkaard. In May 2008, Rijkaard was dismissed with one year remaining of his contract after finishing third in La Liga, with his assistants Neeskens and Eusebio Sacristán leaving with him.

Neeskens joined Frank Rijkaard at Galatasaray as his assistant manager in 2009, and left the club alongside Rijkaard in October 2010. He became the coach of South African club Mamelodi Sundowns in 2011. He was sacked in December 2012 with the team second from bottom after 12 games and having lost the League Cup final to Bloemfontein Celtic.

==Style of play==
Speaking of Neeskens, the UEFA website stated that the &quot;steel-hard midfielder was a tireless runner yet also had nice technique and scored goals, helping to set the stage for Cruyff to shine. A box-to-box midfielder with incredible stamina, great mentality, and a powerful shot, Neeskens excelled at pressuring opponents to regain possession. &quot;He was worth two men in midfield,&quot; said teammate Sjaak Swart.&quot;

Neeskens had begun his career as a right-back for Heemstede, but was moved into midfield by Ajax manager Ștefan Kovács. He played in the Total Football team designed by Kovács&#x27;s predecessor Rinus Michels, in which players were expected to change position fluidly.

==Personal life and death==
Neeskens was married twice: to Marianne Schiphof in 1974 with whom he had a son, and to Swiss-born Marlis von Reding in 1985, with whom he had two daughters and a son. John Neeskens, a Dutchman who also played in Spain, was incorrectly assumed to be his son.

He was Jewish.

Neeskens died while in Algeria on 6 October 2024, at the age of 73. He was in the country as part of a KNVB coaching project, and had suffered a heart attack.

<text>David Callahan (born 1964/1965) is an American writer and editor. He is the founder and editor of &quot;Inside Philanthropy&quot;, a digital media site, and Blue Tent Daily, which offers in-depth reporting on progressive organizations and the Democratic Party. Previously, he was a senior fellow at Demos, a public policy group based in New York City that he co-founded in 1999. He is also an author and lecturer. He is best known as the author of the books &quot;The Givers&quot; and &quot;The Cheating Culture&quot;.

==Early life and education==
David Callahan is the son of bio-ethicist Daniel Callahan and psychologist Sidney Callahan. He grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

He received his B.A. at Hampshire College, and in 1997 received a PhD in Politics from Princeton University.

==Career==
Callahan was a fellow at The Century Foundation from 1994 to 1999; his work area was US foreign policy and international affairs. 

In 1999, Callahan co-founded the liberal think tank Demos. He left Demos in 2013 to start &quot;Inside Philanthropy&quot;.

=== &quot;Inside Philanthropy&quot; ===
Callahan launched the news website &quot;Inside Philanthropy&quot; in early 2014. The site&#x27;s tag line is &quot;Who&#x27;s Funding What, and Why.&quot; It covers news about recent gifts by foundations and major donors, as well as the world of fundraising and trends in philanthropy. The site also includes profiles of funders to help nonprofits find money and publishes a daily newsletter. In addition, it issues its own set of annual awards, the &quot;IPPYs,&quot; that include categories such as the &quot;Philanthropist of the Year&quot; and &quot;Foundation President of the Year.&quot; &quot;Inside Philanthropy&quot; is mainly funded by subscriptions, which currently cost $397 a year or $47 a month. The site says that it &quot;has never taken money from the funders we cover and never will.&quot;

==Writing==
In addition to his articles in &quot;Inside Philanthropy&quot;, Callahan has written articles for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, &quot;The American Prospect&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot;.

In 1997 he wrote a political-thriller novel, &quot;State of the Union&quot;, in which Islamic terrorists plot to hijack planes and crash them into the Capitol building during the State of the Union address.

In 2002, Callahan wrote the book &quot;Kindred Spirits: Harvard Business School&#x27;s Extraordinary Class of 1949 and How They Transformed American Business&quot;, a history of the Harvard Business School Class of 1949. In an interview about the book with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Callahan contrasted this earlier group of business leaders, many of whom frowned on conspicuous consumption, with later generations of business leaders more motivated by greed.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; review of his 2004 book, &quot;The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead&quot;, Chris Hedges called Callahan &quot;a new liberal with old values&quot;. The book links the rise in unethical behavior in American society to economic and regulatory trends—particularly growing inequality. The libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot; criticized Callahan for placing too much blame for cheating on the rise of laissez-faire economics.

His 2007 book &quot;The Moral Center&quot; examines how a market-based economy, i.e. capitalism, with its elevation of self-interest, undermines values that both liberals and conservatives care about. &quot;The American Prospect&quot; reviewed the book.

His 2017 book &quot; The Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age&quot; looks at top philanthropists such as Michael Bloomberg and Mark Zuckerberg. The book was widely reviewed, including in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. &quot;The Givers&quot; generated wide discussion and controversy in the world of philanthropy, including in industry publications such as &quot;The Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot;, &quot;Stanford Social Innovation Review&quot;, and &quot;Philanthropy&quot; magazine.

<doc id="616567" wikidata="Q311393" url="?curid=616567" title="Rob Rensenbrink">
<text>Pieter Robert Rensenbrink (; 3 July 1947 – 24 January 2020) was a Dutch footballer and member of the Netherlands national team that reached two FIFA World Cup finals, in 1974 and 1978. A creative and prolific left winger or forward, he became a legend in Belgium while playing in the great Anderlecht side of the 1970s. He is the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup&#x27;s all-time top scorer, with 25 goals. A talented dribbler as well as a cool finisher and adequate passer, he only ever missed two penalties in his entire career. He was also the first winner of the Onze d&#x27;Or in 1976.

== Club career ==

Born 3 July 1947, in Amsterdam, Rensenbrink started his career at DWS, an Amsterdam amateur club, before moving to Belgian side Club Brugge in 1969. Between 1971 and 1980 he played for Anderlecht where he enjoyed his greatest club successes. In total when in Belgium he twice won the Belgian Championships, the Belgian Cup five times and at European club level the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup twice (in 1976 and 1978, as well as being runner-up in 1977). Rensenbrink delivered a notable performance in the 1976 final as Anderlecht ran out 4–2 winners against West Ham United. He scored two goals, one from the penalty spot and set up François Van der Elst for the fourth goal. Among his team mates was Dutch internationalist compatriot, Arie Haan. In 1980, he left Anderlecht and wound down his career with a spell at Portland Timbers in the NASL, followed by a brief stay with Toulouse in France in 1981.

== International career ==

Rensenbrink made his international debut for the Netherlands national football team against Scotland in 1968, but picked up relatively few caps due to competition for the forward positions with Johan Cruijff and Piet Keizer. However, Rinus Michels included him for the 1974 FIFA World Cup squad that made the short trip to West Germany.

The Dutch side that took part in the 1974 FIFA World Cup were the pinnacle of Total Football. Most of the 1974 team were made up of players from AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, so Rensenbrink was an outsider and was unfamiliar with playing the system. His preferred position was up front on the left, but that position was already Johan Cruijff&#x27;s domain, so he played on the left-wing position in midfield, taking over from Ajax player Piet Keizer. He missed one game in the tournament (when Keizer played instead) and was only half-fit for the final after picking up an injury during the semi-final against Brazil. Rinus Michels gambled on Rensenbrink&#x27;s fitness and played him from start – however he only lasted until half-time and was replaced by René van de Kerkhof. The Netherlands took an early lead through a Johan Neeskens penalty, but goals from Paul Breitner and Gerd Müller gave West Germany a 2–1 victory. Rensenbrink&#x27;s performances saw him named to the team of the tournament and he was sought by Ajax as a replacement for Keizer. However, contract negotiations fell through and he remained at Anderlecht.

Rensenbrink stayed in the Netherlands national team during the qualifiers and finals of the 1976 European Football Championship. However, the Netherlands fell at the semi-final stage to Czechoslovakia.

In the 1978 FIFA World Cup tournament in Argentina, the Netherlands again reached the final, but this time without Cruijff (who decided to retire from international football) and under the guidance of Ernst Happel rather than Michels. Out of the shadow of Cruijff, Rensenbrink found more room to showcase his own considerable talent, playing on the left-hand side of a front three alongside Johnny Rep and René van de Kerkhof. He scored a hat-trick in the opening game against Iran, another goal against Scotland which was goal number 1,000 in FIFA World Cup history and a penalty in the 5–1 win over Austria. In the final against Argentina, the Netherlands yet again met the hosts. The Netherlands fell behind to a first-half Mario Kempes strike. After Dick Nanninga&#x27;s equalizer nine minutes from time, a long pass from the Dutch captain Ruud Krol in the last 30 seconds of normal time gave Rensenbrink a half-chance, but his shot from a very narrow angle hit the post and was cleared by a defender. Had he scored, it is almost certain that the Netherlands would have won the World Cup with Rensenbrink being top goal scorer. Argentina scored twice in extra-time for a 3–1 victory and the Netherlands again had to settle for the runners-up spot.

Rensenbrink played some of the qualifiers for Euro 80, but after earning his 46th cap in 1979 (a 2–0 defeat by Poland in a qualifier for Euro 80), he retired from international football at the age of 32, having scored 14 times for his country. He along with Eusébio are the only players to score the most goals from a penalty spot in a tournament (4 in 1978).

He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He was also named Anderlecht&#x27;s greatest ever foreign player in 2008.

== Personal life ==
Rensenbrink was married and lived in Oostzaan. In the summer of 2015, he revealed that he had been diagnosed with progressive muscular atrophy three years earlier. He died on 24 January 2020, aged 72. Belgian news sources reported that he had been diagnosed with a muscular disease in 2012 which led to his death.

<text>Molenhoek () is a village located in south-eastern Netherlands partially in the municipality of Mook en Middelaar in the province of Limburg and partially in the municipality of Heumen in the province of Gelderland. It is also the northernmost town of Limburg and thus its nickname is &quot;De Poort van Limburg&quot; (The Gate of Limburg).

Molenhoek lies on the Maas river (which originates in France as the Meuse (river)); the Maas-Waal Canal connects the Maas at Molenhoek to the Waal near Nijmegen.

In the Gelderland part of the village the former Bergzigt (later De Raaf) brewery is located.

<text>Sténio Joseph Vincent (; February 22, 1874 – September 3, 1959) was President of Haiti from November 18, 1930 to May 15, 1941.

==Biography==
Sténio Vincent was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. His parents were Benjamin Vincent and Iramène Brea, who belonged to the mulatto elite.

==Presidency==
In October 1930, while still under occupation by the United States, Haitians elected representatives to the national assembly for the first time since 1918. It elected Vincent as President of Haiti. He had graduated from law school at age 18 before ascending to head of Haiti&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies by 1915. He ran a nationalist campaign for the presidency based on his fierce opposition to the United States occupation of Haiti.

From 1915 to 1934 Haiti was occupied by U.S. Marines; the United States had intervened after the murder of President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam. In August 1934 U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt withdrew the Marines; however, the United States maintained direct fiscal control until 1941 and indirect control over Haiti until 1947.

In 1935, Vincent conducted a plebiscite about extending his term in office, receiving a favorable vote to extend it to 1941. The plebiscite also approved an amendment to the constitution so that future presidents would be elected by popular vote.

In 1936, the Haitian Communist Party was disbanded by Vincent.

In October 1937 troops and police from the Dominican Republic massacred thousands of Haitian labourers living near the border in the Parsley Massacre. Vincent had enjoyed a cooperative relationship with and financial support from the government of Dominican President Rafael Trujillo. After two years of relative quiet in Port-au-Prince, Vincent&#x27;s failure to press for justice for the slain workers prompted protests in the capital. United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt took the case to the Dominican government, which agreed in 1938 to compensate the slain workers’ relatives the following year.

In 1941, Vincent declared his intention to step down. The presidency was peacefully transitioned to his successor, Élie Lescot.

<doc id="616574" wikidata="Q31603" url="?curid=616574" title="Draft (sports)">
<text>A draft is a process used in some countries (especially in North America) and sports (especially in closed leagues) to allocate certain players to teams. In a draft, teams take turns selecting from a pool of eligible players. When a team selects a player, the team receives exclusive rights to sign that player to a contract, and no other team in the league may sign the player. The process is similar to round-robin item allocation.

The best-known type of draft is the entry draft, which is used to allocate players who have recently become eligible to play in a league. Depending on the sport, the players may come from college, high school or junior teams, or teams in other countries. An entry draft is intended to prevent expensive bidding wars for young talent and to ensure that no team can sign contracts with all of the best young players and make the league uncompetitive. To encourage parity, teams that do poorly in the previous season usually get to choose first in the postseason draft, sometimes with a &quot;lottery&quot; factor in an attempt to discourage teams from tanking.

Other types of drafts include the expansion draft, in which a new team selects players from other teams in the league, and the dispersal draft, in which a league&#x27;s surviving teams select players from the roster of a newly defunct franchise. Major professional sports leagues also have special contingency plans for rebuilding a team via a disaster draft, should an accident or other disaster kill or disable many players.

Drafts are usually permitted under antitrust or restraint of trade laws because they are included in collective bargaining agreements between leagues and labor unions representing players. These agreements generally stipulate that after a certain number of seasons, a player whose contract has expired becomes a free agent and can sign with any team. They also require minimum and sometimes maximum salaries for newly drafted players. Leagues may also allow teams to trade draft picks among each other in exchange for other draft picks or in exchange for players.

In 1935, National Football League president Joseph Carr instituted the NFL draft as a way to restrain teams&#x27; payrolls and reduce the dominance of the league&#x27;s perennial contenders. It was adopted by the precursor of the National Basketball Association in 1947; by the National Hockey League in 1963; and by Major League Baseball in 1965, although draft systems had been used in baseball since the 19th century.

Major Indoor Lacrosse League (National Lacrosse League) adopted a collegiate draft in 1988, Major League Soccer in 2000, Major League Lacrosse in 2001, and Major League Rugby in 2020.

Sports drafts are uncommon outside the U.S. and Canada. Most professional football clubs and those in other sports obtain young players through transfers from smaller clubs or by developing youth players through their own academies. The youth system is operated directly by the teams themselves, who develop their players from childhood. Parity in these leagues is instead maintained through promotion and relegation, which automatically expels the weakest teams from a league in exchange for the strongest teams in the next lower league.

== Australia ==
===AFL draft===
In Australian rules football&#x27;s premier competition, the Australian Football League (AFL), a draft was introduced in 1986 when the competition was then known as the Victorian Football League (VFL). This was in response to the increasing transfer fees and player salaries at the time, which in combination with declining attendances, threatened to derail the league. It was also a result of the failure of country zoning, introduced in the late 1960s, which had led to a systematic inequality whereby the clubs with the best zones, like Carlton and Hawthorn, could dominate over clubs with poorer zones like Melbourne.

In the AFL Draft, clubs receive picks based on the position in which they finish on the ladder. Therefore, the teams that finish at the bottom of the AFL ladder will get the first draft picks. Also, any team that finishes in a low ladder position for consecutive seasons will receive priority picks.

The AFL&#x27;s National Draft is held in November, with a pre-season draft and a rookie draft held in December.

===NSWRL draft===
The 1991 NSWRL season featured the introduction of rugby league football&#x27;s first draft system. The draft allowed teams to recruit players on a roster system based on where the club finished the previous year. It ran in reverse order with the wooden spooners getting first choice and the premiers last. The draft lasted just the one season before being defeated in the courts by players and coaches opposed to its limitations.

==Africa==
===SA20 Auction===

Like the IPL the SA20 also has an auction where teams bid on players and subject a salary cap and restrictions on roster size. After the main auction takes place there is then a rookie draft where each team has two minutes to pick one rookie player that is 18–22 years of age. The team that finished last place in the last season is the first to pick and the team that finished first in the last season is the last to pick.

==Europe==
===KHL draft===

When the Russian Superleague became the Kontinental Hockey League, the collective bargaining agreement between the KHL and its players introduced a draft, starting from the very first season of the league. It also allowed teams to use a first-round draft pick to select protected players from a team&#x27;s farm system. The KHL Junior Draft was discontinued in 2016.

===The Hundred===

A draft system is used for The Hundred, a professional franchise 100-ball cricket tournament in England and Wales run by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), which started in 2021. The inaugural Hundred draft took place in October 2019.

==North America==
===CFL Draft===
The Canadian Football League (CFL) holds its annual player drafts before the start of the season, either in the last days of April or the start of May. The league&#x27;s drafts consists of two that occur on the same day: a larger main draft for Canadian players preceded by a smaller draft for &quot;global&quot; players.

The main draft was formerly held as part of the annual league meetings in Hamilton, but is now typically held by conference call with the first two rounds being broadcast live on TSN. Since 2016, the main draft has consisted of eight rounds, with teams drafting in inverse order of their records in the previous season, with the Grey Cup runner-up selecting second-to-last and the Grey Cup champion selecting last. As with the NFL Draft, trading of picks is very common, meaning that a team will not necessarily have eight picks in a given draft. The draft main is restricted to Canadian citizens, plus non-citizens who were raised in Canada since childhood (see the relevant section of the main CFL article). Eligible players can be drafted both from U Sports football programs in Canada and U.S. college football programs.

Since 2019, players who are neither American nor Canadian, designated as &quot;global players&quot;, are eligible for and subject to a smaller separate draft that occurs earlier in the morning before the main draft for Canadian players. This draft is structured like the main draft, but is not broadcast on television.

American players, which can compose up to half of a CFL team&#x27;s roster, are not subject to a draft and enter the league by way of the negotiation list, a process that allows a CFL team to unilaterally stake claim to any international player on a first-come, first-served basis without the player&#x27;s consent and bar them from negotiating with any other CFL team; this includes almost all of the league&#x27;s quarterbacks.

===Global T20 Canada===
In the inaugural 2018 Global T20 Canada a player draft was held for franchises to choose the players from the available pool.

===NFL draft===
Draft order in the NFL is determined in a reverse-record order (the previous season&#x27;s worst team picking first, the Super Bowl winner picking last). There are 7 rounds of the draft (a maximum of 224 picks), so each team can have 7 selections, plus whatever compensatory selections a team receives as a result of free agency (up to 32 compensatory selections are given each year), and any picks awarded for developing minority candidates for NFL head coaching or general manager positions (starting with the 2021 draft in accordance with NFL Resolution JC-2A). Teams are allowed to trade draft picks (including compensation picks since 2017) among each other in exchange for other draft picks or in exchange for players.

Because the NFL requires that players be three years removed from high school, and of the lack of an effective junior development system outside the college and university programs, players are chosen almost exclusively from National Collegiate Athletic Association college football programs.

The NFL draft has become one of the key events on the American football calendar, airing live on television each April. In recent years it had been held at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall, but in 2015 and 2016 it was held at Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Theatre,&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago/Los Angeles&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2017 it was held on the Rocky Steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The 2018 draft was the first ever to be held at an NFL stadium, namely the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; AT&amp;T Stadium.

===NBA draft===

The NBA Draft, held historically in an NBA city, but in recent drafts in either a theater in the New York area or at the Barclays Center each summer, is only two rounds long (60 picks). Instead of automatically granting the top pick to the worst team from the year before, the NBA holds a draft lottery to determine who chooses first. The top four picks are allocated by chance among the 14 teams that did not make the playoffs the year before. This discourages a team from losing on purpose to get a better draft pick, but also causes other controversies such as allegations and conspiracy theories suggesting that the draft lottery is rigged.

NBA teams choose players from the NCAA and from teams overseas. It was formerly common for players to be chosen directly from high school, but in 2006, the NBA required that players wait a year after high school before playing in the NBA. Almost all top U.S. players thus play at least one year in college.

===NHL Entry Draft===
The NHL operates a seven-round off-season draft (224 picks). Like the NBA, the NHL uses a lottery system to determine which team gets the top pick. All 16 teams, up from 15 between 2017 and 2021, that failed to qualify for the playoffs take part in the weighted lottery with the winner moving up to select first overall. Any North American player aged 18–20, and any overseas player aged 18–21 is eligible to be selected. Players are generally chosen from junior hockey teams, high schools, the NCAA and overseas clubs.

The NHL rotates the draft&#x27;s location among cities with teams in the league. Like baseball, players drafted in the entry draft usually have to wait a few years in development, either in junior hockey or the minor leagues, before cracking an NHL roster; usually, only one or two draft picks, generally, those that are widely predicted to be blue-chip superstars, jump directly from the draft to the NHL (e.g. Sidney Crosby or Jaromír Jágr).

The league has incrementally expanded the draft lottery process over the course of the early 2010s to discourage &quot;tanking&quot;—the act of deliberately losing to get a better draft pick. Historically, the league only subjected the first overall pick to the draft lottery among the five worst teams in the league, meaning that if a draft had more than one marquee prospect (a generally rare occurrence), it would still be a viable strategy to tank, as a second overall pick was still guaranteed. This was made evident in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft, where marquee prospects Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel were both seen as NHL-ready and likely to be stars; much speculation surrounded the struggling Buffalo Sabres, who allegedly tanked to secure the rights to at least the second overall pick (a charge that, although the Sabres&#x27; fans openly encouraged it, the team officially denied). From the 2016 to 2020 drafts, the top &quot;three&quot; overall picks were subject to lottery among all fourteen teams that did not make the playoffs, meaning the last-place team will only be assured of the fourth overall pick, at which point virtually any marquee prospect will have already been selected. Since the 2021 draft, only two draws are held for the first two selections. Starting with the 2022 lottery, the team winning one of the two lotteries is only allowed to move up a maximum of ten spots in the draft order and teams will only be allowed to win the lottery twice in a five-year period.

The three major junior leagues that make up the Canadian Hockey League also hold drafts of teenage players in their territories.

===MLB draft===
Major League Baseball holds two drafts each year. In June, the first-year player draft, MLB&#x27;s entry draft, takes place. Only players from Canada, the U.S. or a U.S. territory may be drafted; players from elsewhere are free agents and can be signed by any team. Draftees are high-school graduates who have opted not to go to college; college baseball players at four-year institutions who have played three years or turned 21; or junior college baseball players. As of 2021, the draft lasts 20 rounds (down from 40 in 2019 with the exception of a 5-round 2020 draft), but earlier drafts have lasted up to 100 rounds. The MLB Draft generally receives less attention than the drafts in other American sports, since drafted players usually spend several years in the minor leagues before they crack the Major League team&#x27;s roster. Also, unlike the MLS, NFL, NBA and the NHL Drafts, the MLB draft takes place during the season instead of in the offseason.

In December, MLB holds the much shorter Rule 5 draft. If an organization keeps a player in the minor leagues for a certain number of years, other teams can draft him in the Rule 5 draft. The drafting team must keep the player on its major league roster; it cannot put the player in its own minor leagues system.

===MLC draft===
===MLL draft===

MLL implemented its first collegiate draft in 2001. The draft was held every year until MLL merged with the Premier Lacrosse League in December 2020, with the merged league operating under the PLL banner.

===MLS Draft===
Major League Soccer has two types of draft that occur each year, plus a third that is held intermittently when the league adds one or more teams. The two annual drafts are the three-round long MLS SuperDraft (a maximum of 81 picks since 2021, down from four rounds and 104 picks in 2020), which was held for the first time in 2001, and MLS Supplemental Draft, with the MLS Expansion Draft held in the offseason immediately before the league expands.

The MLS SuperDraft happens every January. During the draft the teams from the league will pick up to three players each from colleges across the United States. Only players from the American college sports system (e.g., the NCAA and the NAIA) are eligible to be drafted. Canadian U Sports men&#x27;s soccer players are not included.

The draft is divided into three rounds in which each club has one selection.

In addition to drafted players, MLS teams also acquire new players from their youth academies. These players are called homegrown players. Homegrown players are academy players who are given a first-team contract. They are required to have spent at least one year in a club&#x27;s academy, and to have lived in the club&#x27;s territory (for example, in the case of Orlando City, northern Florida).

The draft gives to the teams opportunity to acquire players from other regions of the country, from outside their territory.

The teams can also acquire new players by signing players from other leagues (usually foreigner leagues). MLS has two transfer windows—the primary pre-season transfer window lasts three months from mid February until mid May, and the secondary mid season transfer window runs one month from early July to early August.

===MLR draft===
Major League Rugby implemented its first collegiate draft in 2020. Players are eligible for draft after 3 years in college at 21 years old. Free agents can try to join teams at 18 years old.

===MLW draft===
Major League Wrestling held its first draft in 2021.

===NLL draft===
NLL held its first collegiate draft in 1988 as Major Indoor Lacrosse League.

===NWSL drafts===

The National Women&#x27;s Soccer League used drafts from its inaugural 2013 season until the 2024 season. The first was a draft of college players, followed by a supplemental draft. The final draft of 2013 was a preseason waiver draft in which teams could select players who had been waived by their first squads, but only one player was selected at that time.

The league held a college draft, referred to after 2021 simply as the NWSL Draft after the inclusion of non-collegiate selections, prior to each league season. The waiver draft, now called the &quot;re-entry wire&quot;, has also become a permanent part of the league. The league also created other draft mechanisms to address other types of eligibility, such as the unsubsidized individual distribution ranking order introduced for college draft-ineligible NWSL federation players in 2016, and the under-18 entry list for domestic minors introduced in 2023. With league expansion and contraction since its establishment, the league has also irregularly held both expansion drafts to help stock the rosters of new teams, and a dispersal draft in which teams could select players from a defunct team.

On August 22, 2024, the NWSL announced the elimination of its draft and discovery systems as part of its renegotiated collective bargaining agreement with the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League Players Association. NWSL teams could pursue and sign any prospective collegiate and international players as free agents, transfers between NWSL teams would require player consent, and all contracts would become guaranteed, bringing the league closer in line with global standards within the sport.

===PLL draft===
The Premier Lacrosse League held its first collegiate draft in 2019, shortly before the start of its inaugural season.

===UFL draft===
The United Football League held its first rookie draft in 2024, and its two predecessor leagues (the USFL and XFL) held rookie drafts in 2023. Players eligible for the UFL draft are those who were eligible for that year&#x27;s NFL draft but went selected.

===WNBA draft===

The WNBA draft is held every spring. It has had several locations during its history; the most recent draft in 2022 took place in New York City, following two drafts held virtually due to COVID-19 concerns. The draft is currently three rounds long with each of the 12 teams in the league (trades aside) making three picks each. Draft order for teams that made the playoffs the previous year are based on team records. The team with the highest previous record will pick last. Since eight teams qualify for playoffs, the bottom eight picks are determined by this method. For the remaining top four picks, a selection process similar to the NBA Draft Lottery is conducted for the four teams that did not qualify for the playoffs.

===WWE Draft===

The WWE Draft is used to refresh WWE&#x27;s Raw and SmackDown rosters, as well as shuffle talent between the two.

==South Asia==
===IPL auction===
Cricket&#x27;s Indian Premier League instead holds a yearly auction before the start of each season in which teams bid on players, subject to a salary cap and restrictions on roster size.

===ISL draft===
Indian Super League is responsible for holding drafts prior to the commencement of each season. Teams can buy foreign players with international experience while they still can purchase Indian players with little or no experience.

===PSL draft===
The Pakistan Super League uses a draft system for player recruitment before the start of every season to fairly distribute the league&#x27;s new players. Teams are allotted slots in every round of the draft and slots can be exchanged with other teams.

==Southeast Asia==
===PBA draft===

The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) draft is an annual event in the PBA calendar in which teams can acquire new players outside the league which are not free agents. Only natural-born Filipinos and foreign nationals with Filipino ancestry, whether or not they acquired Philippine citizenship, are eligible to be drafted. The draft began in 1985; prior to that teams directly hired rookies.

Until 2014, there was a draft lottery between the two worst team of the preceding season. This was scrapped after the events of the 2014 draft lottery.

The PBA Developmental League also has their own draft.

==Other terminology==
===Draft bust===
A &quot;draft bust&quot; is a highly touted or highly selected draftee who does not meet expectations. This can be for a variety of reasons such as being unable to adjust to the professional level or if their career was derailed by injuries. A player is also regarded as a bust if more successful players are drafted after them.

====NFL====
One of the most frequently cited examples of a draft bust in the NFL is Ryan Leaf, who was selected second overall in the 1998 NFL draft by the San Diego Chargers, after the Indianapolis Colts had selected future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning. The Chargers had chosen Leaf over future Hall of Famers Charles Woodson, Randy Moss, and Alan Faneca, as well as six future Pro Bowlers.

Despite being described as being equal in talent to Manning prior to the draft, Leaf only managed to play two seasons with the Chargers and start 18 games (winning only four) for them before being released in 2000. Leaf played only three further games for the Dallas Cowboys, and was out of the league by 2002.

Tony Mandarich and JaMarcus Russell, two other frequently cited draft busts, are examples of players whose status as busts are amplified by their placements in the draft:

* Mandarich is the only top-five pick from the 1989 NFL draft who is not in the Hall of Fame, having been selected second overall by the Green Bay Packers after the Dallas Cowboys selected Troy Aikman, with the subsequent three picks being Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas, and Deion Sanders. The Packers also passed on Hall of Famer Steve Atwater as well as six future Pro Bowlers to select Mandarich. 
* Russell was selected first overall in the 2007 NFL draft by the Oakland Raiders, with the next two picks being Hall of Famers Calvin Johnson and Joe Thomas. The Raiders also passed on Hall of Famers Darrelle Revis and Patrick Willis as well as Pro Bowlers Adrian Peterson, Marshawn Lynch, Eric Weddle, Ryan Kalil, Greg Olsen, Joe Staley, and Marshal Yanda to select Russell.

Like Leaf, Russell was released by the Raiders after three seasons and was out of the league by 2010. Mandarich later managed to become a serviceable offensive lineman for the Indianapolis Colts after being released by the Packers in 1992, but ultimately never lived up to his draft position.

Other frequently cited examples include:
* Art Schlichter (QB) - Schlichter was selected 4th overall by the Baltimore Colts in the 1982 NFL draft, selecting him over Hall of Famers Marcus Allen, Mike Munchak, Andre Tippett, and Morten Andersen as well as Pro Bowlers Jim McMahon, Gerald Riggs, and Mike Quick. Schlichter&#x27;s gambling addiction ultimately derailed his career and was out in the NFL after just 3 seasons.
* Todd Blackledge (QB) - Blackledge was selected 7th overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 1983 NFL draft, selecting him over Hall of Famers, Bruce Matthews, Jim Kelly, Dan Marino, and Darrell Green, as well as Pro Bowlers Joey Browner, and Roger Craig. Blackledge spent most of his career as a backup QB and was out of the NFL by 1990.
* Ki-Jana Carter (RB) - The Cincinnati Bengals traded two draft picks to the newly expanded Carolina Panthers to get their first overall pick to draft Carter in the 1995 NFL draft the Bengals selected him over Hall of Famers drafted in the first round, Tony Boselli, Warren Sapp, Ty Law, Derrick Brooks, the Bengals also missed out on Hall of Famers drafted outside the first round, Curtis Martin, and Terrell Davis, also All-Pros, Steve McNair, Ruben Brown, Hugh Douglas, and Todd Sauerbrun. Carter only spent 5 seasons with the Bengals before he was released, and would eventually leave the NFL by 2004. His career was mostly plagued by injuries and ultimately never lived to his high draft position.
* Andre Wadsworth (DE) - Wadsworth was selected third overall by the Arizona Cardinals in the 1998 NFL draft, the Cardinals selected him over Hall of Famers Charles Woodson, Randy Moss, and Alan Faneca, as well as All-Pros Keith Brooking, Flozell Adams, Patrick Surtain, and Olin Kreutz. Wadsworth only played three seasons with the Cardinals before the team released him after going through career ending surgery although in 2007 Wadsworth tried to return to the NFL to no avail.
* Akili Smith (QB) – The New Orleans Saints had offered the Cincinnati Bengals nine future draft picks in exchange for their No. 3 first-round pick in the 1999 NFL draft. The Bengals declined the offer and selected Smith.
* Lawrence Phillips (RB) – The St. Louis Rams traded Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis to the Pittsburgh Steelers believing that Phillips could better fill the position. While Phillips was regarded as a highly-talented player, his off-field issues derailed his career.
* Todd Marinovich (QB) – Remembered for both his unorthodox upbringing and being selected ahead of Hall of Famer Brett Favre.
* Tim Couch (QB) – Selected first overall by the expansion Cleveland Browns in the 1999 NFL draft over future six-time Pro Bowler Donovan McNabb, who was selected second overall by the Philadelphia Eagles, also Hall of Famers Edgerrin James, Champ Bailey, as well as All-Pros Torry Holt, Chris McAlister, Daunte Culpepper, Jevon Kearse, Al Wilson, and Joey Porter. Couch only played 4 seasons with the Browns before being released Couch would leave the NFL by 2007.
* Courtney Brown (DE) - The Cleveland Browns with the first overall pick for the second consecutive year the Browns picked Courtney Brown at the 2000 NFL draft who turned out to be a bust like Tim Couch the Browns selected him over Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher, also All-Pros Chris Samuels, John Abraham, Julian Peterson, Shaun Alexander, as well as Pro Bowlers LaVar Arrington, Jamal Lewis, Thomas Jones, Bubba Franks, and Keith Bulluck. Courtney Brown only spent 5 seasons with the Browns before the Browns released him he would leave the NFL after 6 seasons.
* Charles Rogers (WR) – The Detroit Lions selected Charles Rogers at second overall in the 2003 NFL draft over Hall of Famers Andre Johnson and Troy Polamalu, as well as All-Pros Kevin Williams, Terrell Suggs, Nnamdi Asomugha, Lance Briggs, Jason Witten, and Pro Bowlers Anquan Boldin, Jordan Gross. Rogers would only play 15 games and was out of the league after three seasons.
* Robert Gallery (OT) - The Oakland Raiders selected Robert Gallery at second overall at the 2004 NFL draft the Raiders selected him over All-Pros Larry Fitzgerald, Philip Rivers, Ben Roethlisberger, Vince Wilfork, Steven Jackson, Chris Snee, also Pro Bowlers, DeAngelo Hall, Jonathan Vilma, Tommie Harris, Bob Sanders, and Darnell Dockett. Gallery was considered pre-draft to be one of the best Offensive Tackle prospects but Gallery struggled at Tackle before moving to Guard after three seasons at Tackle where he became a serviceable Guard, Gallery would eventually leave the NFL by 2012 Gallery never lived up to expectations of being a highly touted Offensive Tackle at his high draft pick position.
* Trent Richardson (RB) – The Cleveland Browns traded four draft picks to the Minnesota Vikings for their third overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft, picking Richardson over Luke Kuechly, Stephon Gilmore, Fletcher Cox, Chandler Jones, David DeCastro, Harrison Smith, and Bobby Wagner. Richardson spent less than two seasons with the Browns before being traded to the Indianapolis Colts. He never lived up to his draft position and left the NFL after five seasons. 
* Justin Gilbert (CB) – The Cleveland Browns traded up to the 8th overall pick in 2014 NFL draft to select Gilbert, passing on Anthony Barr, Odell Beckham Jr., Aaron Donald, Zack Martin, C. J. Mosley, Derek Carr, DeMarcus Lawrence, Davante Adams, and Jarvis Landry. Gilbert would only play 23 games with 3 starts over two seasons, recording 39 tackles and one interception, before being traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He was released a year later and left the league after being suspended for violating the NFL&#x27;s drug policy.
* Josh Rosen (QB) - The Arizona Cardinals traded three draft picks to the Oakland Raiders for the 10th overall pick in the 2018 NFL draft to draft Rosen the Cardinals selected him over Minkah Fitzpatrick, Derwin James, Jaire Alexander, Frank Ragnow, Lamar Jackson, Nick Chubb, and Shaquille Leonard. Rosen would only play one season with the Cardinals before being traded to the Miami Dolphins after the Cardinals got the first overall pick in the 2019 NFL draft to draft Kyler Murray, Rosen would only play one season with the Dolphins he was waived after the Dolphins drafted Tua Tagovailoa in the 2020 NFL draft Rosen would leave the NFL after 5 seasons.
* Trey Lance (QB) – The San Francisco 49ers traded three first round picks and a second round pick to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for their third overall pick in the 2021 NFL draft so they could draft Lance. Lance would only play in eight games over two seasons for the 49ers before being traded to the Dallas Cowboys after the emergence of Brock Purdy, the Mr. Irrelevant of the 2022 NFL draft, as the team&#x27;s starter.

====NBA====
In the NBA, one of the most well-known example of a draft bust is LaRue Martin, who was selected first overall in the 1972 NBA draft by the Portland Trail Blazers: the Trail Blazers passed on Hall of Famers Bob McAdoo, Paul Westphal, and Julius Erving to select Martin. Despite being seen as an excellent prospect, Martin had a career average of only 5.3 points per game, and was out of the NBA by 1977.

Another well-known example is Sam Bowie: while proving to be a serviceable though injury-prone player, Bowie was haunted by being drafted second overall by the Trail Blazers in the famously talent-rich 1984 NBA draft. Hall of Famer Hakeem Olajuwon was the first pick, while the Trail Blazers passed on Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton to select Bowie.

Other notable examples include:
* Michael Olowokandi, in 1998, who was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers first overall, ahead of Hall of Famers Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki, and Paul Pierce. Olowokandi is well-known for his unorthodox path to being drafted in the NBA. 
* Frédéric Weis, in 1999, who was selected by the New York Knicks in the first round, ahead of Ron Artest and Manu Ginóbili, but never played in the NBA.
* Kwame Brown, in 2001, who was selected by the Washington Wizards first overall, ahead of Pau Gasol and Tony Parker. 
* Darko Miličić, in 2003, who was selected by the Detroit Pistons second overall, ahead of Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, and Dwyane Wade.
* Greg Oden, in 2007, who was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers first overall, ahead of Kevin Durant, Al Horford, and Marc Gasol.
* Hasheem Thabeet, in 2009, who was selected by the Memphis Grizzlies second overall, ahead of James Harden, Stephen Curry, and DeMar DeRozan.
* Evan Turner, in 2010, who was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers second overall, ahead of DeMarcus Cousins and Paul George.
* Derrick Williams, in 2011, who was selected by the Minnesota Timberwolves second overall, ahead of Klay Thompson, Kawhi Leonard, and Jimmy Butler.
* Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, in 2012, who was selected by the Charlotte Bobcats second overall, ahead of Bradley Beal, Damian Lillard, and Draymond Green.
* Anthony Bennett, in 2013, who was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers first overall, ahead of Giannis Antetokounmpo and Rudy Gobert.
* Nik Stauskas, in 2014, who was selected by the Sacramento Kings eighth overall, ahead of Zach LaVine and Nikola Jokić.
* Dragan Bender, in 2016, who was selected by the Phoenix Suns fourth overall, ahead of Domantas Sabonis, Pascal Siakam, Jamal Murray, and Malcolm Brogdon.
* Markelle Fultz, in 2017, whom the Philadelphia 76ers traded up to the first pick overall to select. The Boston Celtics, with whom the 76ers had swapped picks, then chose All-Star Jayson Tatum with the pick the 76ers had previously held. Fultz was also selected ahead of Donovan Mitchell and Bam Adebayo.
* Marvin Bagley III, in 2018, who was selected by the Sacramento Kings second overall, ahead of Luka Dončić, Trae Young, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and Jalen Brunson.

====MLB====

Notable draft busts include Steve Chilcott (1966), Brien Taylor (1991), and Brady Aiken (2014), all of whom were 1st overall draft picks who never reached the majors.

A well-known example is pitcher David Clyde, the first overall pick in the 1973 draft by the Texas Rangers. Despite being only 18 years old at the time of his selection, the Rangers called-up Clyde directly to the majors instead of developing him the minors. After 2 mediocre seasons with the Rangers, Clyde was sent down to the minors and would not return to the majors until 1978 after he was traded to the Cleveland Indians. After 2 seasons with the Indians, Clyde retired at only 26 years old due to shoulder injuries. Clyde&#x27;s career made him the &quot;poster-boy&quot; for bringing up young players prematurely. The Rangers passed on future Hall of Famers Robin Yount, Dave Winfield, and Eddie Murray to take Clyde.

Matt Bush (2004), another 1st overall pick, dealt with legal troubles culminating in incarceration and waited nearly 12 years to make the major leagues, eventually doing so as a middle relief pitcher in 2016.

Pitcher Mark Appel, the first overall pick in 2013, stepped away from baseball after 2018 due to repeated struggles on the mound. He returned to the game in 2021, but did not make his major league debut until the 2022 season for the Philadelphia Phillies, appearing in only six games and has not pitched in the majors since.

A player like outfielder Josh Hamilton (1999) can also be considered a draft bust before unexpectedly turning his career around, winning the 2010 AL MVP Award.

====NHL====
A notable draft bust was Alexandre Daigle (1993 Draft), who is notable for saying &quot;I&#x27;m glad I went number one, cause no one remembers number two&quot; upon being drafted by the Ottawa Senators. The number two selection that year happened to be eventual Hockey Hall of Fame inductee Chris Pronger.

Other players cited as major draft busts include: 
* Greg Joly, who was selected 1st overall in 1974 by the Washington Capitals, spent the majority of his career in the minor leagues.
* Gord Kluzak, who was selected 1st overall in 1982 by the Boston Bruins, had an injury-plagued career playing only one full season throughout his nine years in the NHL.
* Alek Stojanov, who was selected 7th overall in 1991 by the Vancouver Canucks, was an enforcer with scoring ability who lost scoring touch due to injury before his first NHL game. He also became known for the weaker piece involved in one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history, when the Canucks traded him to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for eventual All-Star forward Markus Näslund.
* Patrik Štefan, who was selected 1st overall in 1999 by the Atlanta Thrashers, had an injury-plagued, seven season career. The Vancouver Canucks, with whom the Thrashers had swapped a pick with to choose Štefan, then chose all-star and eventual Hall of Famers Daniel Sedin and his twin brother Henrik at second and third overall respectively.
* Pavel Brendl, who was selected 4th overall in 1999 by the New York Rangers, signed in Europe after playing with three different NHL teams in parts of four seasons.
* Rick DiPietro, who was selected 1st overall in 2000 by the New York Islanders, had eventual career ending injuries which started in his second season of a groundbreaking 15-year contract, and played only 50 games thereafter.
* Petr Taticek, who was selected 9th overall in 2002 by the Florida Panthers, spent the majority of his underperforming North American career in the minors, and only played three NHL games with the Panthers. Afterwards, he spent the remainder of his career between the Kontinental Hockey League and various European leagues.
* Hugh Jessiman, who was selected 12th overall in 2003 by the New York Rangers, played all but two games of his North American career in the minors. Many players selected after Jessiman would go on to have substantial NHL careers, such as Dustin Brown, Brent Seabrook, Zach Parise, Ryan Getzlaf, Brent Burns, Ryan Kesler, Mike Richards, Corey Perry, and Patrice Bergeron.
* Nikita Filatov, who was selected 6th overall in 2008 by the Columbus Blue Jackets, spent the majority of his North American career in the minors, playing only 53 NHL games. Filatov was selected ahead of all-stars Josh Bailey, Erik Karlsson, Jordan Eberle, John Carlson, Jacob Markström, and Roman Josi.
* Scott Glennie, who was selected 8th overall in 2009 by the Dallas Stars, only played a single game in the NHL and spent the majority of his career in the minors. Glennie was selected ahead of all-stars Chris Kreider, Kyle Palmieri, and Ryan O’Reilly.
* Nail Yakupov, who was selected 1st overall in 2012 by the Edmonton Oilers, returned to the Kontinental Hockey League after playing with three different NHL teams over six seasons.
* Griffin Reinhart, who was selected 4th overall in 2012 by the New York Islanders, played all but 37 games of his North American career in the minors. Reinhart, along with Yakupov, was selected ahead of all-stars Morgan Rielly, Hampus Lindholm, Filip Forsberg, and Andrei Vasilevskiy.
* Olli Juolevi, who was selected 5th overall in 2016 by the Vancouver Canucks, spent the majority of his injury-plagued North American career in the minors, playing only 41 NHL games before returning to his native Finland to play in the SM-liiga. Juolevi was selected ahead of all-stars Matthew Tkachuk, Clayton Keller, and Charlie McAvoy.

====Australian Football League====
Examples of draft busts include Scott Gumbleton and Mitch Thorp. Gumbleton and Thorp were selected with the second and sixth picks respectively in the 2006 AFL draft; their clubs, Essendon and Hawthorn, passed on future All-Australian players Travis Boak, Joel Selwood, Ben Reid, James Frawley, Jack Riewoldt, Shane Edwards, Todd Goldstein, Bachar Houli and Robbie Gray to draft them.

Thorp managed only two games in three years with Hawthorn before being delisted, while Gumbleton managed only 35 games in six years with Essendon before being traded to Fremantle, after which he retired without playing another game.

===Draft steal===
Conversely, a player who was drafted at a low spot or in later rounds and is expected to have little success yet goes on to have a stellar and productive career is known as a &quot;draft steal&quot;.

====MLB====
Mike Piazza, who went on to become one of the best catchers of the 1990s, a 12-time MLB All-Star selection and a Hall of Famer, was chosen in the 62nd round (1390th overall) of the 1988 MLB draft and was selected only as a favor to Tommy Lasorda (whose team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, drafted Piazza): to further put the pick in historic perspective, the MLB draft is now much shorter, having most recently been reduced from 40 rounds to 20 in 2021.

José Bautista was selected in the 20th round, 599th overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2000. Although his major league career started off slowly in 2004, Bautista, after being traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in 2008, experienced a breakthrough season in 2010. He led the majors in home runs in 2010 and 2011 and would make the American League All-Star Team six consecutive seasons from 2010-2015.

====NFL====
One of the most notable examples is Tom Brady, who was drafted late in the sixth round (at 199th overall pick) of the 2000 NFL draft by the then-mediocre New England Patriots only as a fourth-string backup quarterback, but went on to have a two-decade career winning seven Super Bowls (six with the Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers), five Super Bowl MVPs, and three NFL MVPs, setting the all-time records for wins, passing yards, completions, and touchdowns in the process. Similarly, two-time Super Bowl champion Roger Staubach was a tenth-round pick in both the AFL and NFL drafts, largely due to having a four-year commitment to serve in the U.S. Navy.

Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterbacks that were draft steals include Johnny Unitas, who was drafted in the ninth round of the 1955 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers, who cut him at the end of the team&#x27;s training camp, while Bart Starr, a two-time Super Bowl MVP and five-time championship winner, was the 200th overall pick in 1956 due to concerns about back injury problems. Brett Favre was a second-round selection, while Joe Montana and Dan Fouts were third-round selections, with Montana slipping due to an average combine performance.

The 2017 NFL draft has seen two draft steals emerge. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who was selected in the third round (69th overall) by the Los Angeles Rams, has the most receptions, touchdown catches, and receiving yards of any wide receiver or player drafted in 2017 (as of the conclusion of the 2022 NFL season), including the six wide receivers that were drafted ahead of him. Furthermore, in 2021, Kupp won the receiving triple crown, AP Offensive Player of the Year Award, and Super Bowl LVI MVP in what is regarded as one of the greatest seasons by a wide receiver in NFL history. Tight end George Kittle was selected in the fifth round (146th overall) by the San Francisco 49ers. As of the end of the 2024 NFL season, Kittle has been selected to six Pro Bowl teams and five All-Pro teams and was a key piece in the 49ers reaching Super Bowls LIV and LVIII.

Wide receiver Tyreek Hill, was selected in the fifth round (165th overall) of the 2016 NFL draft by the Kansas City Chiefs, has been named to eight Pro Bowls, six with Chiefs two with the Dolphins, was included in the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, was a 4 time All-Pro receiver from 2018 to 2023 and also an All-Pro first-team punt returner in his rookie year in 2016, led the Chiefs to their first Super Bowl win in 50 years Super Bowl LIV and was the key member to the Chief&#x27;s dynasty until he was traded in 2022 to the Miami Dolphins.

Antonio Brown was drafted 195th overall by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2010 but was an All-Pro receiver from 2013 to 2018, before being traded to the Oakland Raiders in 2019 (later getting released by them and the New England Patriots over accusations of sexual assault). Brown would eventually help the Tampa Bay Buccaneers win Super Bowl LV.

Center Jason Kelce was drafted in the sixth round, 191st overall by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2011 NFL draft. Kelce went on to play thirteen seasons with the Eagles, being selected to seven Pro Bowl teams and six All-Pro teams, and is widely considered one of the greatest centers in NFL history. Kelce also helped the Eagles reach two Super Bowls and won Super Bowl LII. Similarly, Jason&#x27;s brother Travis was a third-round selection by the Kansas City Chiefs, but went on to become a seven-time All-Pro while setting multiple receiving records for the tight end position and helping the Chiefs win Super Bowls LIV, LVII, and LVIII.

Wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown was drafted in the fourth round at 112th overall of the 2021 NFL draft by the Detroit Lions. St. Brown played a key part in the rebuilding of the Lions organization, led by head coach Dan Campbell, that turned them from a struggling team into a Super Bowl contender.

Quarterback Brock Purdy was selected last overall in the 2022 NFL draft by the San Francisco 49ers. Initially a third-string backup, he eventually was moved to starter after injuries to Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. Purdy has since led the 49ers to an NFC Championship Game in and an appearance in Super Bowl LVIII in , leading the NFL in passer rating, garnering a Pro Bowl spot, and being an MVP finalist in the latter season.

====NBA====
Manu Ginóbili, a key contributor to four San Antonio Spurs championships in the 21st century, was the next-to-last pick (57th) in the 1999 NBA draft. He was also the centerpiece of Argentina&#x27;s national team in the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he led his country to a gold medal.

Another notable draft steal is Isaiah Thomas, who was selected as the 60th and last pick in the 2011 NBA draft, but emerged as an All-Star in 2017 and led the Boston Celtics to the first seed in the Eastern Conference that same year. He also finished 5th in MVP voting in 2017 with an average of 28.9 points and 5.9 assists.

Draymond Green, who was selected as the 35th pick in the 2012 NBA draft, was a key contributor to the Golden State Warriors winning four championships. Green has been named to multiple All-Star selections and also won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2017.

Nikola Jokić, a Serbian who was selected by the Denver Nuggets as the 41st pick in the 2014 NBA draft, remained in Europe for the 2014–15 season to develop his skills before arriving in the NBA in 2015. In his second season, he quickly became a solid post playmaker, averaging about 16.7 ppg, 4.9 apg, and 9.8 rpg. He was also named to the All-NBA Team in both 2019 (first team) and 2020 (second team), and won league MVP in 2021, 2022 and 2024 while leading the Nuggets to their first championship in 2023. He was the first 2nd round pick to win MVP since Willis Reed in 1970; the latter was the 8th pick in the 1964 NBA draft. Jokić was also a crucial member of Serbia&#x27;s national team in the 2016 and 2024 Summer Olympics, where he won silver and bronze medals respectively.

DeAndre Jordan, who was selected as the 35th pick in the 2008 NBA draft, became an All-Star in 2017 and led the league in rebounding two years in a row (2014, 2015). He became a significant contributor of the &quot;Lob city Clippers&quot; era for the Los Angeles Clippers, along with Blake Griffin and Chris Paul. Jordan would win alongside Jokić and the Denver Nuggets in the 2023 NBA Finals.

Kyle Korver, who was selected as the 51st pick in the 2003 NBA draft, went to have a successful 17-year career in the NBA. He was an All-Star in 2015 and is one of the most prolific 3-point shooters in league history, ranking eighth all-time in 3-point field goals made with 2,450.

Jordan Clarkson, who was selected as the 46th pick in the 2014 NBA draft, won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award with the Utah Jazz in 2021.

Malcolm Brogdon, who was the 36th pick in the 2016 NBA draft, won the Rookie of the Year award in 2017 and became a member of the exclusive 50–40–90 club in 2019. He also won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award in 2023.

Jalen Brunson, who was selected as the 33rd pick in the 2018 NBA draft, went on to have a breakout year in 2024, making his first All-Star and All-NBA team and led the Knicks to 2nd place in the Eastern Conference.

Marc Gasol is also another example as he was selected as the 48th pick by the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2007 NBA draft, but was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in a package that sent his older brother Pau to the Lakers. Like his brother Pau, he became an elite rim protector who could pass, shoot, and score efficiently in the post, and later in his career became an example of a &quot;stretch five&quot;, a center capable of effective scoring from three-point range. He was also the 2013 NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and he helped the Toronto Raptors win their first championship in 2019.

====NHL====
The 1984 Entry Draft is noted for the unusually high number of future Hall of Famers picked, particularly in lower rounds: Patrick Roy, the only player with three Conn Smythe trophies, was drafted 51st in the third round; Brett Hull, the fifth highest goal scorer of all time, was drafted 117th in the sixth round; and Luc Robitaille, who retired as the highest-scoring left winger in the NHL, was drafted 171st in the ninth round.

Hall of Famer Doug Gilmour was drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the seventh round, 134th overall at the 1982 NHL Entry Draft; during his career he scored over 1,400 points, won a Stanley Cup and Frank J. Selke Trophy.

Pavel Datsyuk, drafted 171st in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, won two Stanley Cups and is considered one of the most talented NHL players of all-time.

The Detroit Red Wings have drafted Nicklas Lidström (53rd in 1989), Sergei Fedorov (74th in 1989), Vladimir Konstantinov (221st in 1989), Tomas Holmström (257th in 1994) and Henrik Zetterberg (210th in 1999) in later rounds, all of whom contributed to one or more of the four Stanley Cup wins, between 1997 and 2008, by the Red Wings.

A similar Stanley Cup legacy was achieved by the Tampa Bay Lightning, drafting Alex Killorn (77th in 2007), Nikita Kucherov (58th in 2011), Ondřej Palát (208th in 2011), Cédric Paquette (101st in 2012), Brayden Point (79th in 2014), Anthony Cirelli (72nd in 2015), Mathieu Joseph (120th in 2015) and Ross Colton (118th in 2016), all of whom contributed to back-to-back Stanley Cups wins by the Lightning in 2020 and 2021.

Vezina Trophy winners Dominik Hašek (drafted 199th in 1983), Tim Thomas (drafted 217th in 1994), Miikka Kiprusoff (drafted 116th in 1995), Ryan Miller (drafted 138th in 1999), Henrik Lundqvist (drafted 205th in 2000), Pekka Rinne (drafted 258th in 2004), Connor Hellebuyck (drafted 130th in 2012), Linus Ullmark (drafted 163rd in 2012), and Igor Shesterkin (drafted 118th in 2014) were considered some of the best goalie draft steals, with Thomas winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs while being the lowest-drafted player to win the award and setting a league record for the most saves by a goaltender in a single postseason.

Pavel Bure was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the 6th round, 113th overall, at the 1989 NHL Entry Draft. Due to international transfer disputes which prompted the Canucks to draft Bure later, he had his rookie season two seasons later in 1991, where he would win the Calder Memorial Trophy for being the most outstanding rookie of that season. Later in his career, Bure won the Maurice &quot;Rocket&quot; Richard Trophy for being the leading goal scorer in 2000 and 2001.

Theoren Fleury was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the 8th round, 166th overall, at the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, then scored over 1,000 points, while playing 1,000 games in the NHL between 1989 and 2003.

Joe Pavelski was drafted by the San Jose Sharks in the 7th round, 205th overall, at the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, has become one of the best American-born players of his generation.

Patric Hörnqvist was drafted last by the Nashville Predators at the 2005 NHL Entry Draft (230th in the 7th round), then won two Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Jamie Benn was drafted by the Dallas Stars in the 5th round, 129th overall in 2007, became the franchise&#x27;s sixth captain in 2013, and won the Art Ross Trophy in 2015.

Mark Stone was drafted in the 6th round, 178th overall by the Ottawa Senators, and has been nominated for the Frank J. Selke Trophy (awarded to the league&#x27;s best defensive forward) as a member and now captain of the Vegas Golden Knights.

Kirill Kaprizov was drafted in the 5th round, 135th overall by the Minnesota Wild. Kaprizov remained in his native Russia to play in the Kontinental Hockey League for four seasons to develop his skills before making his NHL debut in 2021 where he won the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year. Since then, Kaprizov has been selected as an all-star game player three times in his career.

Late Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Johnny Gaudreau, who was selected in the 4th round, 104th overall by the Flames in 2011, opted to play college ice hockey in the National Collegiate Athletic Association for three years where he won many accolades in the process, including one Hobey Baker Award for being the most outstanding player in college hockey and had his first full NHL season in 2014 where his college accolades and experience immediately translated to prosperity as a rookie. In that season, Gaudreau was named to the All-Star Game and was a finalist of the Calder Memorial Trophy. Later in his career, Gaudreau would be named to six more all-star games, win the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for being the most sportsmanlike player of the 2016-17 season, and was named to the First All-Star Team in the 2021-22 season where he was second in
league scoring with 115 points (40 goals and 75 assists).

====Australian Football League====
An example of a draft steal is Hawthorn midfielder Sam Mitchell who was drafted with pick 36 in the 2001 AFL draft. Mitchell went on to become a four-time premiership player, a premiership captain with Hawthorn in 2008, a 2012 Brownlow Medalist, a three-time All-Australian, a five-time Peter Crimmins Medallist and the 2003 AFL Rising Star.

Another example of a draft steal in the AFL is former Essendon midfielder James Hird, who was drafted with pick 79 in the 1990 AFL draft. Hird went on to become a two time premiership player, a premiership captain in 2000, the 1996 Brownlow Medalist, the 2000 Norm Smith Medallist, a five-time All-Australian, a five-time W. S. Crichton Medalist, and a member of the Essendon Team of the Century and the Australian Football Hall of Fame.

Another notable AFL draft steal is Collingwood midfielder Dane Swan, who was drafted with pick 58 in the 2001 AFL draft. Swan became a premiership player with Collingwood, a three-time Copeland Trophy winner, the 2011 Brownlow Medalist and a five-time All-Australian.

Another notable AFL draft steal was West Coast Eagles midfielder Matt Priddis. Priddis was drafted with the 31st Pick in the 2005 Rookie Draft after being overlooked in the previous three national drafts. Priddis would go on to be the winner of the 2014 Brownlow Medal, the first player to do this who was originally drafted in the Rookie draft. In his final season (2017), Priddis became the all-time league leader in tackles and became the first person to reach 1,500 tackles. Priddis also became just the second player to win both the Brownlow Medal and Sandover Medal.

===Other===
Mr. Irrelevant is a title given to the last player selected in each year&#x27;s NFL Draft. The phrase pokes fun at the typically poor chances such a player has of ultimately making an impact in the league, although several went on to productive or notable NFL careers, such as Ryan Succop and Brock Purdy.

Some unusual draft picks in professional sports history have included Taro Tsujimoto, a fictional Japanese ice hockey forward who was drafted in the 1974 NHL amateur draft by the Buffalo Sabres (a move made in protest of the league&#x27;s decision to hold the draft by phone, in an attempt to discourage the rival WHA); actor John Wayne, who at age 64 was legally drafted by the Atlanta Falcons in the 1972 NFL draft; and Derrell Robertson, a man who was mistakenly drafted by the Ottawa Rough Riders in the 1995 CFL Dispersal Draft for the Las Vegas Posse after his death in the previous year.

<text>Franklin Edmundo &quot;Frank&quot; Rijkaard (; born 30 September 1962) is a Dutch former footballer and former manager who played as a defensive midfielder. Regarded as one of the best midfielders in footballing history, Rijkaard was described by British broadsheet &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as having been &quot;a stylish player of faultless pedigree&quot;.

Rijkaard played for Ajax, Real Zaragoza and AC Milan. With Ajax, he won five Eredivisie titles and the 1994–1995 Champions League. With AC Milan, he won Serie A titles, as well as the 1988–89 and 1989–90 European Cup (Champions League) titles.

He earned 73 caps for the Netherlands national team. He was part of the team that won the 1988 European championship and finished third in the 1992 European championship. He also played in the 1990 and 1994 World Cups.

In his managerial career, he is most well known for his five-year tenure at Barcelona where he won the 2004–05 and 2005–06 La Liga titles, as well as the 2005–06 Champions League. He has also managed the Netherlands national team, Sparta Rotterdam, Galatasaray and the Saudi Arabia national team.

==Playing career==

===Ajax===
Rijkaard was born in Amsterdam. His father Herman (1935–2010) was a Surinamese footballer who arrived in the Netherlands along with the father of Ruud Gullit and his mother Neel is Dutch; the two boys grew up playing football together in the city. Rijkaard was just 17 when Ajax coach Leo Beenhakker gave him his senior squad debut on 23 August 1980. He made an immediate impact, scoring the third goal in a 4–2 away victory over Go Ahead Eagles, the first league match in the 1980–81 season. He would play another 23 games for Ajax in his first season, netting four goals. In 1981–82, he won his first league championship with Ajax and went on to successfully defend the title the following season.

Rijkaard stayed at Ajax for seven-and-a-half seasons. During this period, he won the Dutch league championship three times (1981–82, 1982–83, 1984–85) and the Dutch Cup three times (1982–83, 1985–86, 1986–87). In the 1986–87 season, he won the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with Ajax over Lokomotiv Leipzig, winning 1–0. In September 1987, what would have been Rijkaard&#x27;s third season (1987–88) under Dutchman Johan Cruyff as head coach, Rijkaard stormed off the training field and vowed never to play under him again. He was subsequently signed by Sporting CP, but he signed too late to be eligible to play in any competition. He was immediately loaned out to Real Zaragoza, but upon completing his first season at Zaragoza was signed by AC Milan.

===AC Milan===
Rijkaard played for five seasons at Milan. Playing alongside fellow country-men Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit, Rijkaard won the European Cup twice (in 1989 against Steaua București and 1990, against Benfica) and the domestic Serie A championship twice. In the 1990 European Cup Final, he scored the only goal to win the cup for Milan.

===Return to Ajax===
After five seasons in Italy, Rijkaard returned to Ajax in 1993. With Louis van Gaal at the helm, Rijkaard and Danny Blind formed the experienced defensive core of the Ajax team that won the first two of three consecutive Dutch championships. Ajax were the unbeaten champions of the Netherlands in the 1994–95 season, and carried that success into Europe. In his final game, Rijkaard won the Champions League with a 1–0 victory over his former club Milan in the 1995 final at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna.

==International career==

In 1981, Rijkaard debuted for the Netherlands national football team during a friendly match against Switzerland. He was part of the Dutch side that won UEFA Euro 1988 with a 2–0 victory in the final against the Soviet Union, playing at centre-back alongside Ronald Koeman.

At UEFA Euro 1992, Rijkaard set up Dennis Bergkamp&#x27;s only goal of the match in the Netherlands&#x27; opening victory against Scotland, and scored the opening goal in a 3–1 victory over Germany in their final first round match, which allowed them to top their group. At the semi-final stage against eventual champions Denmark, after setting up Bergkamp&#x27;s opening goal, Rijkaard scored a late equalizer for the Netherlands in a 2–2 draw, but the Dutch went out on penalties, despite Rijkaard successfully netting his spot-kick. In the quarter-finals of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he made his final appearance for the Netherlands in the 3–2 defeat against eventual winners Brazil.

===Spitting incident===

Rijkaard was the cause of an incident with Rudi Völler when West Germany played the Netherlands in the second round of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Rijkaard was booked for a tackle on Völler and, as Rijkaard took up position for the free kick, he spat in Völler&#x27;s hair. Völler complained to the referee and was booked as well. From the resulting free kick, Völler then handled the ball and then went to the ground (according to his own account) to avoid a collision with Dutch keeper Hans van Breukelen, while others, notably Rijkaard and van Breukelen, saw Voller&#x27;s handball and his resulting action as a dive in hopes for a penalty. Van Breukelen was angry at this but Rijkaard, already annoyed by Völler&#x27;s previous antics, again confronted the West German by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot. Argentine referee Juan Carlos Loustau sent off both Rijkaard and Völler. As he jogged back to the entrance tunnel, Rijkaard again spat in Völler&#x27;s hair as they left the pitch. Germany won the match 2–1 and eventually went on to win the tournament. The German press nicknamed him &quot;Llama&quot; for his spitting. Rijkaard would later apologise for his behaviour to Völler, who accepted.

==Style of play and reception==
Regarded as one of the greatest players ever in his position, Rijkaard was a quick, strong, complete and tenacious defensive midfielder, who was praised by pundits throughout his career for his physical and athletic attributes, his work rate, positioning, his acute tactical intelligence and decision-making, as well as his outstanding consistency and ability to read the game. Due to his aggression and versatility, he was also capable of playing as a central or box-to-box midfielder, and even in a defensive role, usually in the centre. Although Rijkaard was known as a strong tackler, he was surprisingly elegant for a player of his size, and also possessed good technique, passing ability, link-up play, and vision, which made him adept at starting attacking plays as a deep-lying playmaker once he won back possession. He was also capable of playing in more advanced roles as an attacking midfielder or second striker. Due to his height and physical strength, he excelled in the air; possessed a powerful shot; and was capable of getting forward and contributing to his team&#x27;s attacking plays by making late runs into the penalty area. Rijkaard was described by British broadsheet &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as having been &quot;a stylish player of faultless pedigree&quot;. In 2004, Rijkaard was named in the FIFA 100, Pelé&#x27;s list of the 125 World&#x27;s Greatest Living Footballers.

==Managerial career==

===Netherlands===
Rijkaard worked as assistant to Guus Hiddink with the Netherlands national team during the 1998 World Cup; this was his first experience of coaching, as he had taken a break from football after retiring as a player. At the World Cup, the Netherlands lost the semi-final to Brazil on penalties. When Hiddink resigned as manager, Rijkaard was chosen as his replacement, although he was not first choice.

As the Netherlands were joint hosts of UEFA Euro 2000, they did not take part in the qualifiers, playing only friendlies for two years. In Rijkaard&#x27;s first game, the Netherlands beat Peru 2-0. Between October 1998 and November 1999, they did not win a single game, drawing nine and losing to Morocco and Brazil.

At Euro 2000, the Dutch team topped the group with three wins; 1–0 against the Czech Republic, 3–0 against Denmark and 3–2 against France. In the quarter-final, beat Yugoslavia 6-1, breaking the record for the biggest win at a European Championship. The Netherlands played some of the best football of the tournament, but lost their semi-final match to ten-man Italy on penalties, having also missed two penalties in regular time; Rijkaard resigned immediately afterwards. It was rumoured that he would move to Italy to coach his former club Milan, but this did not happen.

=== Sparta Rotterdam ===
During the 2001–02 season, he became manager of Sparta Rotterdam in the Eredivisie, the oldest professional team in the country. Rijkaard said that he enjoyed the down-to-earth atmosphere, although the club was not financially strong. Under his leadership, Sparta played in the relegation playoff and finished bottom, relegating the club to the second division for the first time in its history.

Rijkaard resigned after their relegation, having received a death threat.

===Barcelona===

====First years====
Rijkaard was not out of a coaching role for long, and less than a year after leaving Sparta, he was appointed manager of Barcelona for the 2003–04 season, with Albert Roca as the assistant coach. The season would prove to be a watershed for the club, but not without initial instability. Rijkaard arrived at the club as it entered a new phase, having elected a new president in Joan Laporta and a new managerial board, but with fans unhappy that Laporta had let English midfielder David Beckham snub the chance to join the club. For Rijkaard, the team he inherited, with the exception of new superstar signing Ronaldinho (who was the club&#x27;s second choice after Beckham), also consisted of many underachieving players from the old guard and era that failed to meet the club and its fans&#x27; demands to match archrival Real Madrid&#x27;s success in the early 2000s, having not won a trophy since 1999.

Rijkaard had a disappointing start at Barcelona that saw some sections of the club&#x27;s fans call for his resignation, and he drew flak from the media when the team lost to Real Madrid in December 2003. Rijkaard&#x27;s resilience won through and from 2004 onwards, he achieved a massive turnaround, as the team went from strength to strength. Barcelona finished runners-up in La Liga in 2003–04, having been close to the relegation zone at one point in the earlier stages of the season. Rijkaard then took Barcelona to the next level as he phased out the old guard and rebuilt a new-look side around Ronaldinho, with new players like Deco, Samuel Eto&#x27;o, Rafael Márquez and Ludovic Giuly, along with the latest promotion of some young players from the previous era trained in the club&#x27;s youth teams, including Víctor Valdés, Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta. He eventually succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club, with the strong support of Laporta, and within the next couple of years finally managed to win La Liga both in 2004–05 and in 2005–06.

====Champions League title and after====

Rijkaard became the first Barcelona coach to have won twice at Real Madrid&#x27;s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, an achievement which even successful managers like Johan Cruyff, Louis van Gaal and Luis Aragonés were unable to accomplish. His no-nonsense policy on and off the field, and the sparkling football played by his team, won him many plaudits and Rijkaard was among the five nominated coaches for UEFA&#x27;s Team of the Year 2005. On 8 March 2006, he was also honoured by UEFA for his contributions to the European Cup competition throughout his career as player and manager.

Rijkaard also achieved success on the European stage, winning the 2005–06 Champions League with a 2–1 win against Arsenal in the final. Barcelona had been losing 1–0 for most of the match before his late tactical substitutions proved the decisive factor, as the introduction of Henrik Larsson and Juliano Belletti contributed directly to Barcelona&#x27;s two goals. The win made him the fifth individual to have won the European Cup both as a player and as a manager, alongside Miguel Muñoz, Giovanni Trapattoni, Johan Cruyff and Carlo Ancelotti, a feat later achieved also by his eventual successor, Pep Guardiola and then Zinedine Zidane.

After losing to Manchester United in the semi-final of the 2007–08 Champions League, Rijkaard was asked whether he would quit at the end of the season, since he had not won anything for two successive seasons. He replied, &quot;I have no intention of leaving. It would be different if the players were saying it is time for me to go but that is not the case.&quot; On 1 May 2008, it was reported that Rijkaard allegedly confided to a colleague that he would be stepping down as Barcelona manager at the end of the season, but 24 hours later, he stated in a press conference that he had no intention of leaving the club.

On 8 May 2008, the day after Barcelona&#x27;s dismal 4–1 defeat to archrivals Real Madrid, Barcelona president Joan Laporta announced that at the end of the 2007–08 season, Rijkaard would no longer be head coach of the first team. Laporta made the announcement after a board meeting, and Rijkaard was succeeded by Pep Guardiola. Laporta made it clear that Rijkaard&#x27;s achievements &quot;made history&quot; and praised him for his time at the club.

===Galatasaray===

On 5 June 2009, Rijkaard signed a two-year contract to manage the Turkish Süper Lig team Galatasaray, following the resignation of Bülent Korkmaz two days earlier. He was sacked on 19 October 2010 and was replaced with Gheorghe Hagi.

===Saudi Arabia===
On 28 June 2011, it was announced that Rijkaard would be head coach of the Saudi Arabia national team after a deal was reached with the Saudi Arabia Football Federation. Saudi Arabia were eliminated in the third round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification after a 4–2 away defeat to Australia in their last match on 29 February, finishing third in their group.

The 21st Arabian Gulf Cup was the second competition for Rijkaard with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis left the competition at the group stage after losing 2–0 against Iraq, a 2–0 win against Yemen and 1–0 defeat against Kuwait. On 16 January 2013, Rijkaard was dismissed under a confidential contractual termination penalty clause following Saudi Arabia&#x27;s exit at the tournament.

===Later career===
In 2013, Florida prep school Montverde Academy hired Rijkaard as their advisor of player development.

In December 2016, Rijkaard announced he would no longer pursue a position as manager.

==Coaching philosophy and style==
As a coach, Rijkaard&#x27;s essential philosophy is to guide his team towards playing attack-minded football as a cohesive unit. In doing this, he believes a team can achieve the dual objectives of winning games and ensuring the audience&#x27;s enjoyment of the spectacle. This follows in the best coaching traditions of Rijkaard&#x27;s countrymen and forebears Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff. In this light, it is notable that Michels coached both Cruyff and Rijkaard during their respective participations with the Dutch national team, and that Cruyff himself went on to coach Rijkaard. Nonetheless, Rijkaard believes in working within a contemporary football context and is not out to imitate the styles and tactics of past masters. In his own words: 

Rijkaard has evidently learned to curb the quick temper of his playing days and is often a portrait of calm and stability in training and along the touchline. He rarely courts controversy in the media and is more apt now to promote a positive environment and let his team&#x27;s play speak for itself when faced with intense rivalry or criticism. The tactics used during his tenure as manager of Barcelona best exemplify Rijkaard&#x27;s commitment to playing stylish attacking football. During the team&#x27;s 2004–05 and 2005–06 campaigns, the coach frequently fielded a 4–3–3 formation, a system which encouraged the flair and creativity of the players in the front third of the field and created optimal interplay between the midfielders and forwards during attacks, with Ronaldinho being the focal point of the team&#x27;s offence. Within this system, the four defenders also tended to play in a relatively high position on the pitch to support the midfield, which frequently advanced to participate in the attack. The team generally focuses on maintaining possession in the opponents&#x27; half of the field, applying pressure in order to force the opposition to make errors in defense and offensive counter-attacking.

==Personal life==
Rijkaard comes from a football-playing family. He is the son of Herman Rijkaard, a former footballer who played for Robinhood in the Surinamese Hoofdklasse, before immigrating to the Netherlands, where he played in the Dutch Eredivisie for Blauw-Wit. His older brother, Herman Rijkaard Jr., is a FIFA certified players&#x27; agent who represents various players internationally. Twice divorced, he is currently married to Stephanie and has four children.

==Media==
Rijkaard features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was featured in the &quot;FIFA 14&quot;, &quot;FIFA 15&quot;, &quot;FIFA 16&quot; and &quot;FIFA 17&quot; Ultimate Team Legends. For &quot;FIFA 18&quot;, &quot;FIFA 19&quot;, &quot;FIFA 20&quot;, &quot;FIFA 21&quot;, &quot;FIFA 22&quot; and &quot;FIFA 23&quot; he appeared as an ICON player in FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT).

<text>Veríssimo Correia Seabra (February 16, 1947 – October 6, 2004) was a Bissau-Guinean general, known for leading a coup that deposed Kumba Ialá on September 14, 2003.

==Early life==
Correia Seabra was born in the capital city, Bissau, on February 16, 1947. He belonged to the Papel minority.

In 1963, at the age of 16, Correia Seabra joined the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) as a guerilla fighting against Portuguese colonial rule. Three years later, he was sent to study electronic engineering in Bulgaria. In 1971, he attended an artillery school in the Soviet Union. On his return to the bush war in Guinea-Bissau, he was out in charge of an artillery unit near the southern border with Guinea. In 1976, he was sent to Portugal for officer training.

==Career==
In the years following independence, Correia Seabra played a key role in the internal politics of the PAIGC. He participated in the 1980 military coup that overthrew President Luís Cabral. Promoted steadily through the ranks, he became deputy head of the Guinea-Bissau military contingent of the United Nations mission in Angola from 1991 to 1992. He was then appointed head of operations in military high command two years later.

===Conflict===
Correia Seabra joined General Ansumane Mané in the 1998 uprising against President João Bernardo Vieira. The nation descended into a brief, but bloody civil war. He was again involved in a May 1999 military coup that forced President Vieira from power. Soon thereafter, he became chief of staff of the armed forces and was appointed Minister of Defense in the government named on February 19, 2000, under President Kumba Ialá. In November 2000, Mané attempted to replace Correia Seabra as chief of staff and placed him under house arrest, but Correia Seabra escaped and fighting erupted; Mané was killed in a clash with government forces a week later. Correia Seabra remained in his position.

==Soldier payment controversy==
As Ialá’s behavior became more erratic and the government failed to pay several months of wages owed to soldiers, he warned the President that the military would be forced to intervene again unless salaries were paid. Correia Seabra led the bloodless coup that ousted Kumba Ialá from power on September 14, 2003. It was welcomed by most Guineans while provoking condemnation from the international community. His first act as head of the 32-member Military Committee for the Restoration of Constitutional and Democratic Order was to convene a meeting of political, religious, and civil society leaders to choose a new civilian-led government that would be charged with organizing elections.

Henrique Rosa was nominated to head the caretaker government and became president on September 28, 2003. Seabra continued to serve as chairman of the National Transition Council. Free and fair parliamentary elections were held on March 28, 2004.

===Death===
On October 6, 2004, a mutiny by soldiers over unpaid salaries turned violent. Veríssimo Correia Seabra along with an aide, Lieutenant Colonel Domingos Barros, were detained and beaten to death by revolting soldiers.

The Portuguese president, Jorge Sampaio, also called for the restoration of legality in Guinea-Bissau, after learning of the death of Veríssimo Seabra.

<text>Feuguerolles-Bully () is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France.

==Population==

In 2010, the climate of the commune was classified as an altered oceanic climate, according to a CNRS study based on data covering the period from 1971 to 2000. In 2020, Météo-France published a climate typology for metropolitan France in which the commune is subject to an oceanic climate and is located in the climatic region of Normandy (Cotentin, Orne), characterized by relatively high rainfall (850 mm/year), a cool summer (15.5°C), and windy conditions. At the same time, the Normandy IPCC, a regional group of climate experts, differentiated in a 2020 study three major types of climates for the Normandy region, further nuanced by local geographical factors. According to this zoning, the commune is exposed to a &quot;sheltered plateau climate,&quot; corresponding to the agricultural plain from Caen to Falaise, sheltered by the Normandy hills and close to the sea, characterized by moderate rainfall and thermal constraints.

From 1971–2000, the average annual temperature was 10.6°C, with an annual thermal amplitude of 12°C. The average annual precipitation was 750 mm, with 12.3 days of rain in January and 7.7 days in July. For the period 1991–2020, the average annual temperature recorded at the nearest weather station, located in Carpiquet 8 km away, was 11.5°C, and the average annual precipitation was 740.3 mm. Future climate parameters for the commune, estimated for 2050 based on different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, are available on a dedicated website published by Météo-France in November 2022.

== Urban Planning ==
=== Typology ===
As of January 1, 2024, Feuguerolles-Bully is categorized as an urban belt, according to the new 7-level density grid defined by INSEE in 2022. It is located outside of an urban unit.

<doc id="616584" wikidata="Q484909" url="?curid=616584" title="Clarence Seedorf">
<text>Clarence Clyde Seedorf (; born 1 April 1976) is a former professional football manager and player. He is regarded by many as one of the greatest midfielders of all time.

Seedorf is considered one of the most successful players in UEFA Champions League history, as he is the only player to have won the Champions League with three clubs — once with Ajax in 1995, once with Real Madrid in 1998, and twice with AC Milan in 2003 and 2007.

At international level, he represented the Netherlands on 87 occasions, and took part in three UEFA European Football Championships (1996, 2000, 2004) and the 1998 FIFA World Cup, reaching the semi-finals of the latter three tournaments.

In 2004, he was chosen by Pelé as part of the FIFA 100. Seedorf is one of the most decorated Dutch players ever, and has won domestic and continental titles while playing.

==Early career==
Born in Paramaribo, Suriname, Seedorf was raised in Almere, Flevoland, where he moved when he was two years old. He grew up in a footballing family, with both his younger brothers Jürgen and Chedric Seedorf, and his father, former player and talent agent Johann Seedorf.

Seedorf began his career at the age of six in the youth ranks of his local amateur sides VV AS &#x27;80 and Real Almere, before being discovered and recruited to the ranks of nearby Dutch giants Ajax by Urgent Scoutingteam, the talent agency set up by Johan Cruyff, and which was responsible for recruiting the likes of Frank and Ronald de Boer, Edgar Davids, Rob Witschge and Patrick Kluivert to the club as well.

Following in their brother&#x27;s footsteps, under the guidance of their father and talent agent, Seedorf&#x27;s siblings, as well as cousin Stefano, would later also join the ranks of Ajax.

==Club career==
===Ajax===
A product of the famed Ajax Youth Academy, Seedorf started his career as a right midfielder for Ajax during the early 1990s. He made his professional debut on 29 November 1992 against Groningen at the age of 16 years and 242 days, making him the youngest-ever debutant for Ajax, at the time. He quickly established himself as the first choice on his position under manager Louis van Gaal, and in the 1993–94 season, his second with the club, he helped the Amsterdam-based side win the treble, securing the Eredivisie title, the KNVB Cup and the Dutch Super Cup in the same year. Among his teammates was Frank Rijkaard, the player he used to idolise in his younger days.

The following season, Seedorf helped his team secure consecutive Super Cup and Eredivisie titles, as well as their fourth European Cup trophy, winning the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League after defeating AC Milan in the final. He played a key role in the final before being replaced in the 53rd minute by striker Nwankwo Kanu. Patrick Kluivert scored a late goal to lift Ajax to a 1–0 victory over the Italian giants, whom Seedorf would later go on to represent for a decade. While at Ajax, he was part of a trio known as &quot;De kabel&quot;, composed of Edgar Davids, Patrick Kluivert and himself. Later, Winston Bogarde and Michael Reiziger would be added to the group to make it a quintet; what had started as a friendship was then taken over during the UEFA Euro 1996 to describe the group.

===Sampdoria===
Opting not to extend his contract with Ajax following their European success and the Bosman ruling, Seedorf signed a one-year contract with Italian Serie A side Sampdoria instead. While not able to obtain any silverware in his first season at his new club, Seedorf appeared in 32 matches, scoring three goals helping his side to an eighth-place finish in the league table, all the while maintaining the form he had demonstrated at Ajax in the past. Seedorf was then able to secure a transfer to Real Madrid, moving to Spain&#x27;s La Liga by the end of the season.

===Real Madrid===
Seedorf moved to Real Madrid in 1996, where he was virtually ever present for &quot;Los Blancos&quot; in his first three seasons. In his first season, he helped the team regain the La Liga title, while in his second season, 1997–98, he played a major role in the team&#x27;s Champions League success, as Madrid secured a 1–0 victory over Juventus in the final, earning his second Champions League title of his career.

While playing for Real Madrid, Seedorf scored a notable long-range goal against Atlético Madrid in 1997.
At the end of the 1998–99 season, Madrid and Juventus wanted to swap Seedorf for Zinedine Zidane, but the deal did not go through and the French playmaker waited two more years before joining Real Madrid.

Starting from the summer of 1999, Seedorf&#x27;s role at Real Madrid became less prominent during the tenure of Dutch manager Guus Hiddink at the club. He was eventually transferred back to Italy during the 1999–2000 season, this time to Inter Milan, for a fee about 44 billion Italian lira (approximately €23 million).

===Inter Milan===
On 24 December 1999, Seedorf moved to Inter in a $24.35 million deal after cementing his place in the Real Madrid midfield for over three years. Despite helping the team to the Coppa Italia final later that season – a 2–1 aggregate loss to Lazio where Seedorf scored Inter&#x27;s only goal – Seedorf could not help bring any major silverware to the club. Nonetheless, he is remembered by many Inter fans for his two goals against Juventus in a 2–2 draw on 9 March 2002, both of which were superb long-range efforts.

===AC Milan===

After two years with Inter, Seedorf moved to their city rivals AC Milan in 2002, in an exchange with Francesco Coco. Seedorf won the Coppa Italia with Milan in 2003, the first time they had won the competition in 26 years. In the same season, Seedorf gained his third Champions League medal, becoming the first player to win the Champions League with three clubs. The all-Italian final saw Milan beat Juventus on penalties after a 0–0 draw, despite Seedorf failing to convert his own penalty. During the game, he also had to switch roles three times; having started the first half on the left in midfield, in the second he was moved into the center, and eventually onto the right side. The following season, 2003–04, Seedorf played a role in the Milan side that won the Serie A title. It was Seedorf&#x27;s fourth national league title of his career, following his two Dutch title wins with Ajax and his one Spanish win with Real Madrid.

Seedorf played a major role as Milan reached the Champions League final again in 2005, scoring the only goal of the game in their opening group match against Shakhtar Donetsk on 14 September 2004 and appearing in all 13 competition matches. He started the match against Liverpool in Istanbul in which Milan lost a 3–0 lead, eventually losing on penalties after a 3–3 draw; Seedorf did not take a penalty-kick. Milan also finished runners-up in the Serie A, seven points behind champions Juventus, although Juventus were stripped of the title and Milan docked points for match-fixing.

A match-fixing scandal tarnished Serie A and Milan were weakened by the scandal but were allowed to continue in Europe the following season, which led to their top players remaining with the club. In that season, 2005–06, he scored a goal after just 25 seconds in a 2–2 draw against Schalke.

Seedorf&#x27;s role as foil to midfielder Kaká became increasingly impressive as the pair combined in style to score and supply the goals which drove Milan past Bayern Munich and Manchester United to another Champions League final, again against Liverpool. This time, however, they defeated them 2–1 in Athens, with Seedorf collecting his fourth Champions League medal. In that same year, Seedorf was a part of the Milan squad that won the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup, becoming the first European player to win the trophy with three clubs (Ajax in 1995 and Real Madrid in 1998). He ended up winning the Silver Ball for the competition for his performances, notably scoring the winner against Urawa Red Diamonds in the semi-final to send his club to the final.
At the end of the 2006–07 season, Seedorf was voted best midfielder of the Champions League. He played his 100th game in the Champions League on 4 December against Celtic.

With Milan, Seedorf formed a formidable midfield partnership with Gennaro Gattuso and Andrea Pirlo, which began since the 2002–03 season. This midfield trio was still used in the starting line-up until the 2011–12 season (Pirlo left the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; in the summer of 2011), although their form had been declining. Under the guidance of coach Carlo Ancelotti, their role was to support an attacking midfielder, whether it be Rivaldo, Rui Costa, Kaká or Ronaldinho.

Seedorf became the foreigner with the most appearances for Milan following a game against his former club, Sampdoria, which he scored in. At 395 appearances, he passed Nils Liedholm for this historic milestone. During the Sampdoria game, he also became the ninth-highest scoring foreigner for Milan, with 58 goals.
On 29 March 2010, Seedorf was the target of racist chants from Lazio fans in a 1–1 draw, which led to the Rome-based club being given a €15,000 fine by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC). This led the Italy&#x27;s players&#x27; union want racism stamped out in Serie A.

Seedorf won his second &quot;Scudetto&quot; with Milan in the 2010–11 Serie A season, where he once again played a vital role. He scored four goals and made 36 appearances in the 2010–11 season.
Seedorf added yet another medal to his trophy cabinet in the first official game of the 2011–12 season, where he played the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 comeback win over rivals Inter Milan in the Supercoppa Italiana. He scored the winning goal of Milan&#x27;s first win of the 2011–12 Serie A campaign, a 1–0 defeat of Cesena on 24 September.

Seedorf was ranked seventh of the 20 best players of the Champions League, a list which was compiled in 2012 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the competition. The ranking was done by &quot;Champions&quot;, the official magazine of UEFA. On 14 May, he said that he was playing his last match with Milan against Novara that day. He also confirmed that he would continue to play football for another club. On 21 June, Seedorf held a press conference announcing his departure from Milan, stating, &quot;I am leaving after 10 wonderful years... I leave a family&quot; after playing for the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; for a decade and winning two Champions League, two &quot;Scudettos&quot; and a Coppa Italia. Club CEO Adriano Galliani spoke of Seedorf following the player&#x27;s departure in the highest regard, stating, &quot;When Milan played well, which happened often, each and every time it occurred Seedorf played an amazing match. He is a world class player.&quot;

===Botafogo===
On 30 June 2012, Seedorf signed a two-year contract with Brazilian club Botafogo. The veteran midfielder made his debut with the club on 22 July against Grêmio. On 5 August, Seedorf scored his first goal for Botafogo, curling in a free kick against Atlético Goianiense. On 5 September, Seedorf scored two goals and made an assist against Cruzeiro, helping Botafogo to a 3–1 victory. On 3 February 2013, for the first time on his career, Seedorf scored a hat-trick against Macaé, his first game as a starter that year. Before that game, Seedorf played the second half against Fluminense and made an assist to Bolívar, who scored the match&#x27;s equalizer.

On 10 March 2013, Seedorf won his first title with Botafogo: the 2013 Taça Guanabara, the first round of 2013 Campeonato Carioca. On 5 May, he won the second round of 2013 Campeonato Carioca – 2013 Taça Rio – against Fluminense. That is also the day of his first official title for Botafogo, the 2013 Campeonato Carioca, as the team won both rounds and no final match was needed. On 6 June, Seedorf scored his 100th goal in domestic league play: 11 with Ajax, 3 with Sampdoria, 15 with Real Madrid, 8 with Inter, 47 with Milan and 16 with Botafogo. On 14 January 2014, Seedorf announced his retirement from professional football. He announced that he is ending his playing career to take up the manager position at Milan following the sacking of Massimiliano Allegri.

==International career==
Due to Surinamese rules against dual citizenship, players who take Dutch citizenship are no longer eligible to represent the Netherlands&#x27; former colony. He received his first callup on 14 December 1994 at the age of 18 against Luxembourg. Seedorf scored on his debut, helping his team to a 5–0 victory in a UEFA Euro 1996 qualifying match.

Seedorf was in the Dutch squad for the UEFA European Championships in 1996, where his penalty miss proved decisive in the quarter-final shootout defeat to France. He also appeared for the Netherlands at Euro 2000 and 2004, as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup, reaching the semi-finals in all three of these tournaments.

On 12 November 2006, Seedorf was recalled for the first time since June 2004 as a replacement for the injured Wesley Sneijder. He started and played the full 90 minutes in a 1–1 friendly draw against England. Seedorf won the last of his 87 caps for the Netherlands in 2007. In the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Romania (0–0 at home) and Slovenia (1–0 away win), Seedorf played four and six minutes respectively. There were doubts on his position within the national team, as Marco van Basten favoured younger players such as Rafael van der Vaart, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie. On 13 May 2008, Seedorf announced that he would not take part in UEFA Euro 2008 due to his ongoing personal conflict with van Basten.

==Style of play==

Nicknamed “Il Professore” and “Willy Wonka”, Seedorf was a well-rounded, hardworking and versatile player, who was gifted with strength, pace, stamina and notable physical attributes, which allowed him to play anywhere in midfield and contribute both offensively and defensively, due to his significant tactical intelligence; although he primarily served as a playmaker in the centre, throughout his career he was also deployed as an attacking midfielder, on the wing, as a &quot;mezzala&quot;, or in a holding or box-to-box role.

A world class midfielder, in addition to his fitness and athletic characteristics, as well as his ability to break down opposing plays and win back possession, he was an elegant, creative player and an excellent dribbler, possessing outstanding technique, ball skills and vision, which enabled him to retain possession when under pressure and subsequently lay the ball off to an on-rushing teammate; he was also an accurate passer and crosser of the ball. Seedorf was also capable of scoring goals due to his powerful, accurate striking ability from distance with either foot; furthermore, he was an effective free kick taker. Despite his physical, energetic, and tenacious style of play, Seedorf was regarded as a player with good behavior, and was sent off only two times in his entire career. In addition to his success and footballing skills, Seedorf has also been praised for his longevity as a footballer.

==Managerial career==
Seedorf was appointed the new head coach of Milan on 16 January 2014, terminating his contract with Botafogo early in order to take on the managerial role, with Milan languishing in 11th in the Serie A table. On 19 January, he won his first managerial match, played against Hellas Verona, with Mario Balotelli scoring the lone goal of the game.

Despite overseeing the club&#x27;s first five-match winning run since 2011, and first Serie A victory in the Milan derby against Inter since 2011, Seedorf was dismissed by Milan on 9 June 2014 after just four months on the job, with Filippo Inzaghi being named as his successor. During the Dutchman&#x27;s time at the helm of the club, Milan gained a total of 35 out of a possible 57 points - the fourth-most out of all Serie A sides (one less than Napoli&#x27;s corresponding total and six less than Roma&#x27;s).

Seedorf was appointed manager of China League One team Shenzhen F.C. in July 2016, but was replaced five months later by Sven-Göran Eriksson. A year later Seedorf joined Brazilian club Atlético Paranaense as both a coach and a sporting director. Within a month the deal was cancelled after both parties failed to reach an agreement. In February 2018, Seedorf was appointed as manager of Spanish club Deportivo de La Coruña for the remainder of the 2017–18 season. Seedorf led the team to just two wins in sixteen matches, Deportivo were relegated from La Liga, and at the end of the season he left the club.

After a deal with Sven-Göran Eriksson could not be agreed, the Fédération Camerounaise de Football appointed Seedorf as the manager of the Cameroon national team in August 2018. He was joined by former teammate Patrick Kluivert as his assistant manager. However, after a disappointing 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, where Cameroon as defending champions were eliminated by Nigeria in the round of 16 after an unimpressive group stage, he was sacked in July 2019.

==Personal life and other work==
Seedorf speaks six languages fluently: Dutch, English, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Sranan Tongo. He was often seen as a spiritual, intelligent and articulate figure in football, and in a 2011 interview, Seedorf stated that he was studying to obtain a master&#x27;s degree in business at the prestigious Bocconi University in Milan; because of this, he earned the nickname &quot;il professore&quot; (&quot;the professor&quot;) during his time playing at Milan. Seedorf married a Brazilian woman, Luviana Seedorf, with whom he owns a restaurant called &quot;Finger&#x27;s&quot; in Milan. They have four children. After separating from his wife, he began a relationship with Canadian-Iranian Sophia Makramati, and converted to her faith of Islam in a March 2022 ceremony in Dubai.

Seedorf has dabbled in media-related work during recent years. In 2009, he worked with &quot;The New York Times&quot; to run a column entitled &quot;Seedorf responds&quot;, where once a month he would answer peoples&#x27; questions regarding football. He joined the BBC&#x27;s team covering the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, working as a television pundit. He also presented a number of features for the BBC coverage, including one about Robben Island. He joined the BBC for their &quot;Match of the Day&quot; Live coverage of UEFA Euro 2012. He has also made appearances on &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; during the English football league season.

Because of his strong connection with the country Suriname, where he was born, he is involved in many social development projects there. He built his own &quot;Clarence Seedorf Stadium&quot; in the district of Para in Suriname. In this stadium, the Para Juniors League of Suriname is being held and the teams of the Suri Profs &amp; SV The Brothers play there regularly. With his Champions for Children Foundation, he supports projects for good causes in Suriname. For this, Suriname has honoured him to Commander of the High-Order of the Yellow Star, and in 2011 he was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau (OON).

In 2012 and 2014, Seedorf took part in &quot;Soccer Aid&quot;, a charity match at Old Trafford with former professional players and celebrities. He played for &quot;The Rest of the World&quot; team against England. In 2014, he scored a hat-trick, where The Rest of the World won 4–2; they raised over £4 million in total.

Clarence&#x27;s nephew, Collin Seedorf, is also a professional footballer, and currently plays for Dutch club, FC Eindhoven.

<text>Kevin Roosevelt Moore (born October 3, 1951), known as Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;, is an American blues musician. He is a singer, guitarist and songwriter, living in Nashville, Tennessee. He has been described as &quot;a living link to the seminal Delta blues that travelled up the Mississippi River and across the expanse of America.&quot; His post-modern blues style is influenced by many eras and genres, including folk, rock, jazz, pop and country. The moniker &quot;Keb Mo&quot; was coined by his original drummer, Quentin Dennard, and picked up by his record label as a &quot;street talk&quot; abbreviation of his given name.

==Biography==
===Early life===
From early on, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;s parents, who were from Louisiana and Texas, instilled in him a great appreciation for the blues and gospel music. By adolescence, he was an accomplished guitarist.

===Career===
Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; started his musical career playing the steel drums in a calypso band. He moved on to play in a variety of blues and backup bands throughout the 1970s and 1980s. He first started recording in the early 1970s with Jefferson Airplane violinist Papa John Creach through an R&amp;B group. Creach hired him when Moore was 21 years old and Moore appeared on four of Creach&#x27;s albums: &quot;Filthy!&quot;, &quot;Playing My Fiddle for You&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m the Fiddle Man&quot; and &quot;Rock Father&quot;. Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;s first gold record was received for a song, &quot;Git Fiddler&quot;, which he co-wrote with Creach on Jefferson Starship&#x27;s &quot;Red Octopus&quot;. &quot;Red Octopus&quot; hit number one on the Billboard 200 in 1975.

Moore was also a staff writer for A&amp;M Records and arranged demos for Almo – Irving music. Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;s debut, &quot;Rainmaker&quot;, was released on Chocolate City Records, a subsidiary of Casablanca Records, in 1980. He was further immersed in the blues with his long stint in the Whodunit Band, headed by Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland producer Monk Higgins. Moore jammed with Albert Collins and Big Joe Turner and emerged as an inheritor of a guarded tradition and as a genuine original.

Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; has appeared on stage (1990–1993) in several versions of the musical Spunk, by George C. Wolfe, an adaptation of three short stories by Zora Neale Hurston. His character, Guitar Man, learned while he was an understudy to &quot;Chick Streetman&quot;, played all the actual music in the play while performing. The character of Guitar Man is the foundation for his stage persona.

In 1994, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; released his self-titled album, &quot;Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;&quot;, which featured two Robert Johnson classics, &quot;Come On In My Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Kind Hearted Woman Blues&quot;. In the Martin Scorsese miniseries &quot;The Blues&quot;, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; states that he was greatly influenced by Johnson. Keb&#x27; was the runner-up for Best New Blues Artist at The Long Beach Blues Festival, where he was spotted by Steve LaVere, who owns the publishing for the entire Robert Johnson song catalogue (1992–93).

Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;s self-titled album was released on Okeh Records, a vintage revival division of Sony Music.

In 1996, he released &quot;Just Like You&quot;, his second album, which featured 12 songs full of Delta rhythms. He won his first Grammy Award for this album, which featured guest appearances from Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt.

On June 10, 1997, Moore performed on the television program &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot;. He joined musicians Laval Belle on drums, Reggie McBride playing bass and Joellen Friedkin on keyboards to perform 14 songs, some from each of his albums. Blues pianist Dr. John also made a guest appearance. This session (known as &quot;Sessions at West 54th: Recorded Live in New York&quot;) was shown on television but was not released as a DVD until late 2000.

In 1998, Moore was involved in the multi-artist project &quot;Begegnungen (Encounters)&quot; by German rock musician Peter Maffay. They performed together a new version of Mo&#x27;s &quot;Am I Wrong&quot; on the album and some more songs in the 30 concerts at the arena tour later the same year, documented on the live album &quot;Begenungen Live&quot;, released in early 1999. A further guest of Maffay at the &quot;Begegnungen&quot; album and tour was Sonny Landreth and many more artists from around the world.

&quot;Slow Down&quot;, his next album, was released in 1998 and featured twelve songs. It earned him a second Grammy Award. The album begins with the song &quot;Muddy Water&quot;, a tribute to Muddy Waters. It also features a song entitled &quot;Rainmaker&quot;, which had been released previously on his first album, eighteen years prior.

His fourth album, &quot;The Door&quot;, was released in 2000. The same year, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; released &quot;Big Wide Grin&quot;, a children&#x27;s album featuring many songs from Moore&#x27;s own childhood, along with some newer children&#x27;s songs and some by Moore himself. In 2001, he appeared on Sesame Street with Kermit the Frog, Grover, Elmo, and other muppets performing the song &quot;Everybody Be Yo&#x27;self&quot;. The album includes an original arrangement of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;, which he performed years later on the 2006 series finale of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, in which he appears as himself to perform the song at the inauguration of President Matt Santos.

In 2003, Martin Scorsese collaborated with many blues musicians including Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; to put together a series of films entitled &quot;The Blues&quot;. Following its release, several albums were released in accordance, some were compilations, some new collaborations and Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; released an album in the series featuring a handful of existing recordings from Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; to The Door.

Also in 2003, Moore and Lyle Lovett released a cover of the Bob Seger song &quot;&#x27;Til it Shines&quot;.

On February 10, 2004, he released &quot;Keep It Simple&quot; which earned him a third Grammy Award, again in the contemporary blues genre. Later that year, he released his sixth studio album, &quot;Peace... Back by Popular Demand&quot;.

Moore released &quot;Suitcase&quot;, on June 13, 2006. His touring band following the release included Reggie McBride on bass, Les Falconer III on drums, Jeff Paris on keyboards, and Clayton Gibb on guitar.

On October 20, 2009, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; released the live album, &quot;Live and Mo&#x27;&quot;.

At the 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festival, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; performed an acoustic set with Stefan Grossman and an electric set with Vince Gill, Albert Lee, James Burton, Earl Klugh and Sheryl Crow. He joined the finale with most of the day&#x27;s performers.

On the first night of the 2013 Crossroads Guitar Festival, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; performed a set with Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Blake Mills and Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy. Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; later performed two songs with emcee Dan Aykroyd. On the second night of the festival, Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; performed with Taj Mahal.

In early 2014, he was nominated for three Grammy Awards for Best Americana Album (&quot;BLUESAmericana&quot;), Best American Roots Performance (&quot;The Old Me Better&quot;) and Best Engineered Album Non-Classical (&quot;BLUESAmericana&quot;). In May, he appeared alongside Metallica at MusicCare&#x27; 10th Annual MAP Fund Benefit Concert at Nokia honoring Ozzy Osbourne and Jeff Greenberg. In October 2014 he honored The Everly Brothers, at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 19th annual Music Masters Series, and in November he honored Mavis Staples alongside Bonnie Raitt, Gregg Allman, Taj Mahal and Grace Potter, at Chicago&#x27;s Auditorium Theatre for celebration of Staples&#x27; life and career in honor of her 75th birthday. Also in late 2014 he was featured on a Jackson Browne tribute album, &quot;Looking into You: A Tribute to Jackson Browne&quot;.

In 2015, his album &quot;BLUESAmericana&quot; won the &#x27;Contemporary Blues Album&#x27; category at the Blues Music Awards.

Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; is part of the No Nukes group which was against the expansion of nuclear power. In 2007, the group recorded a music video of a new version of the Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot;.

==Equipment==
Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; uses several types of guitars, including electric guitars, acoustic guitars and resonator guitars. He has a preference for red guitars, as he says on his website: &quot;I have a history with red guitars. My first electric was a red guitar.&quot; He mostly plays on a red custom Fender Stratocaster that features two single-coil pickups, and one humbucker and is much modified from a regular Stratocaster model. On stage, he prefers a red Hamer guitar with Gibson P-100 pickups. Two of his electric guitars were lost in the 2010 Nashville flood: an Epiphone Sheraton and a Danelectro Selectomatic.

He owns a variety of acoustic and resonator guitars, including a Gibson artist model, a guitar made for him by James Goodall, a National Style N, a National Resorocket, and a Gibson ES-335-shaped resonator guitar with a P-90 pickup that he purchased in a Nashville club and had repaired.

<text>Luis Enrique Martínez García (; born 8 May 1970), known as Luis Enrique, is a Spanish football manager and former player. He is the manager of Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain.

A versatile player with good technique, he was capable of playing in several positions, but usually played as a midfielder or forward, and was also noted for his temperament and stamina. Starting in 1991 and ending in 2004, he represented both Real Madrid and Barcelona with both individual and team success, appearing in more than 500 official games and scoring more than 100 goals. He appeared with the Spain national team in three World Cups and one European Championship.

Luis Enrique started working as a manager in 2008 with Barcelona B, before moving to Roma three years later. In the 2013–14 season he managed Celta, before returning to Barcelona and winning the treble in his first year and the double in the second. In 2018, he was appointed Spain head coach for the first time before resigning for family reasons in 2019; he reassumed the position the same year and subsequently led the team to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and the second place in the 2020–21 Nations League, resigning at the end of the 2022 World Cup. In July 2023, he joined French club Paris Saint-Germain, claiming three domestic trophies in his first season.

==Playing career==
===Club===
Luis Enrique was born in Gijón, Asturias, and began his career with local Sporting de Gijón, where he gained the nickname &quot;Lucho&quot; after Luis Flores, a Mexican forward in the team. He then spent most of his playing days with the two biggest Spanish clubs: first Real Madrid for five seasons and, in 1996, after seeing out his contract and notably scoring in a 5–0 home win against Barcelona in January 1995, stating later he &quot;rarely felt appreciated by the Real Madrid supporters and didn&#x27;t have good memories there&quot;, he moved to their fierce rivals at the Camp Nou on a free transfer. The Catalans&#x27; supporters were at first hesitant about their new acquisition, but he soon won the hearts of the &quot;culers&quot;, staying eight years, eventually becoming team captain and scoring several times in &quot;El Clásico&quot; against his former employers; he passionately celebrated at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, where he grabbed his jersey after a 25-yard strike that beat the opposing goalkeeper.

Luis Enrique netted 46 La Liga goals in his first three seasons with Barcelona, with the side finishing runner-up in 1996–97 and subsequently winning back-to-back domestic championship accolades. Furthermore, he was named Spanish Player of the Year by &quot;El País&quot; in the following campaign. He also scored the opening goal in the 1997 UEFA Super Cup, a 3–1 aggregate triumph against Borussia Dortmund.

During his final years in Barcelona, Luis Enrique was often injured, and did not want to renew his contract. He had been offered a deal by his first club Sporting, which he, however, declined, stating that &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t be able to reach the level he demanded of himself&quot; and that &quot;he wouldn&#x27;t be doing Sporting much of a favour by going there.&quot; His concerns about his level and fitness made him retire on 10 August 2004 at the age of 34, and he finished his professional career with league totals of 400 games and 102 goals, being named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March.

===International===
Luis Enrique played for Spain in three FIFA World Cups: 1994, 1998 and 2002 (as well as UEFA Euro 1996), and scored 12 goals while gaining 62 caps. He was also a member of the gold-winning squad at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, and made his debut for the main side on 17 April 1991, featuring for 22 minutes in a 0–2 friendly loss to Romania in Cáceres.

In the 1994 World Cup, held in the United States, Enrique scored his first international goal, in the round-of-16 3–0 win over Switzerland in Washington, D.C. In the 2–1 quarter-final defeat against Italy at Foxboro Stadium, Mauro Tassotti&#x27;s elbow made contact with his face to bloody effect, but during the match the incident went unpunished – Tassotti was banned for eight games afterwards; when Spain met Italy at Euro 2008 on 22 June, to battle for a place in the semi-finals, Luis Enrique reportedly called for the team to &quot;take revenge&quot; for the 1994 World Cup incident by beating Italy. Tassotti, an assistant coach with AC Milan at the time, told the newspaper &quot;Marca&quot; that he was tired of always being reminded of this incident, and that he had never intended to hurt the Spaniard.

At the 1998 World Cup, Luis Enrique played a major role in a 6–1 rout of Bulgaria in the last game of the group, scoring and assisting once and also winning a penalty, but the Spaniards were eliminated nonetheless. On 5 June of the following year he netted a hat-trick, in a 9–0 win in Villarreal over San Marino in the Euro 2000 qualifiers.

On 23 June 2002, Enrique retired from international football, in order to give the younger players more playing time and focus only on his club.

==Player profile==

Having occupied several positions, Luis Enrique was most noted for his exceptional versatility and consistency. He was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or along the front line, and was fielded in all positions on the pitch throughout his career, except those of central defender and goalkeeper. A strong, courageous, energetic and hard-working team player, with good technical skills, flair and notable stamina, his usual position was as an attacking midfielder in the centre of the pitch, due to his ability to link-up the forwards and the midfield, or as a right winger, but he was capable of playing anywhere along the right flank, and was often deployed as an attacking full-back or wing-back, or even as a left winger on occasion.

Due to his keen eye for goal and ability to make attacking runs into the box, Enrique frequently played as a forward, either in a withdrawn role as a second striker behind the team&#x27;s main goalscorer, or even as an out-and-out striker or centre-forward – he was also used in deeper midfield roles. In addition to his playing abilities, he also stood out for his commitment, temperament, determination and leadership.

==Coaching career==
===Barcelona B===
On 26 May 2008, Luis Enrique returned to Barcelona, taking over the reins of the B team, renamed Barcelona Atlètic for that season. As he succeeded long-time Barcelona teammate Pep Guardiola, he stated: &quot;I have come home&quot;, and &quot;I finished playing here and now I will start coaching here.&quot;; in his second season he found success, helping the club return to Segunda División after an absence of 11 years.

In mid-March 2011, Luis Enrique announced he would leave at the end of the campaign, despite still having two years left on his contract. He led the side to the playoffs, but they were ineligible for promotion.

===Roma===
On 8 June 2011, Luis Enrique reached an agreement with Italian Serie A club Roma to become the &quot;Giallorossi&quot;&#x27;s new head coach. He signed a two-year contract, being joined by a staff of four members, including Iván de la Peña who played two years for crosstown rivals Lazio, as technical collaborator.

Roma was eliminated from the UEFA Europa League by Slovan Bratislava, amid great discussion of the substitution of legendary Francesco Totti for Stefano Okaka. The capital-based side also lost their first game in the domestic league against Cagliari, making it just the third time that they lost the opener in 18 years.

Even though he still had two years remaining on his contract, Luis Enrique decided to leave Roma at the end of the season after failure to qualify for any European competition.

===Celta===
On 8 June 2013, Luis Enrique became Celta&#x27;s new manager, replacing former national teammate Abel Resino. He led the Galicians to the ninth position in his only season, highlights including a 2–0 home win against Real Madrid that ended the opposition&#x27;s possibilities of winning the league title.

On 16 May 2014, Luis Enrique announced that he would be leaving Celta.

===Barcelona===
On 19 May 2014, Luis Enrique returned to Barcelona as a manager on a two-year deal. He was recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta, his former national teammate. His first competitive match was a 3–0 home league win over Elche, where he handed debuts to new signings Claudio Bravo, Jérémy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitić, and gave youth products Munir El Haddadi, Rafinha and Sandro their maiden league appearances for the club, while summer signing Luis Suárez was unavailable for selection due to suspension.

Luis Enrique suffered his first defeat in the competition on 25 October 2014, away against Real Madrid, and although Barcelona had a successful run in the year, his management came under scrutiny because of his tactics involving several lineup changes in consecutive games. Moreover, a quarrel with Lionel Messi and other players further accentuated the team&#x27;s poor form.

Amid reports of dressing room unrest and on back of a defeat to Real Sociedad, Zubizarreta was sacked in early January, weakening Luis Enrique&#x27;s standing at the club. A significant upturn in form followed, as a result of the coach deciding on a settled lineup with a tweak in the formation: Messi and Neymar now played as inverted wingers, while Suárez was the lone striker. He soon equaled Guardiola&#x27;s record of 11 consecutive victories, while the side went on to beat Atlético Madrid and Villarreal convincingly in the Copa del Rey to advance to the final. In the domestic league, after eight wins in nine matches, they returned to the top of the table after 15 weeks.

On 21 April 2015, Luis Enrique recorded his 42nd win after 50 games in charge of Barcelona with a 2–0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain, the best record of any manager. He went on to lead the club to the final of the UEFA Champions League and, on 17 May, led it to its 23rd national championship with one match to spare following a 1–0 win at the Vicente Calderón against Atlético Madrid. On 6 June, having earlier won the domestic cup against Athletic Bilbao by the same score, the team sealed a treble with a 3–1 defeat of Juventus in the Champions League final in Berlin, and three days later he signed a new contract until 2017.
On 11 August 2015, Barcelona won the 2015 UEFA Super Cup 5–4 against Sevilla. On 2 December, against Villanovense in the Copa del Rey round of 32, Enrique decided against bringing on a new player following Mathieu&#x27;s injury with 12 minutes to go even though two replacements could still be made, as the score was 6–1 at that time and the manager said he did not want to risk introducing players to the game without adequate warm-up.

In his first two seasons, Luis Enrique rotated his goalkeepers, with Bravo playing league games and Marc-André ter Stegen playing cup and European matches. Both players, however, expressed opposition to this policy. A second double was achieved on 22 May 2016, following a 2–0 Copa del Rey victory over Sevilla after extra time in which the team played more than 50 minutes with one player less, following the dismissal of Javier Mascherano.

On 1 March 2017, Luis Enrique announced that he would not continue as team manager after 30 June on expiration of his contract.

===Spain===
Luis Enrique was named coach of the Spain national team on 9 July 2018, replacing former club and country teammate Fernando Hierro. His first match in charge occurred on 8 September, and he led the side to a 2–1 win against England in the UEFA Nations League at Wembley Stadium.

In November 2019, Luis Enrique rejoined the national team after having quit his post for personal reasons four months prior. Speaking to the press after his return, a visibly angry Enrique alleged his friend and colleague of six years Robert Moreno — who managed the national team after his resignation — was &quot;disloyal&quot; and wanted to hold on to his interim position.

When Luis Enrique selected a 24-man Euro 2020 squad (despite being allowed 26) that contained no Real Madrid players, he was accused of having an anti-Madrid bias. Several high-profile omissions from his squad were seen as a way for him to assert control over the dressing room and the team. However, he led Spain to the tournament&#x27;s semi-finals, in which they lost against Italy on penalties, after a 1–1 draw.

At the 2022 World Cup, Luis Enrique&#x27;s team was ousted in the round of 16 following another shootout, 3–0 against Morocco. In the wake of this performance, he stepped down from his position.

===Paris Saint-Germain===
On 5 July 2023, Luis Enrique officially became the manager of Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain, succeeding Christophe Galtier; he signed a two-year contract. He won a domestic treble in his first season, also reaching the Champions League semi-finals.

==Manager profile==
===Tactics===
One of the most renowned and successful managers of his generation, Luis Enrique&#x27;s incisive and direct football featuring quick transitions from defense to attack, though reliant on the front three of Messi, Suárez and Neymar, was in sharp contrast to the possession-heavy approach of Barcelona managers immediately prior to him. Statistically, Luis Enrique&#x27;s Barcelona, in his first two years at the club, were better than Guardiola&#x27;s: Comparatively his team had scored more goals and conceded fewer, had a higher win percentage and won competitions at a similar rate. Guardiola hailed them as the best counter-attacking team in the world.

In his first two seasons at the Camp Nou, Luis Enrique fielded a 4–3–3 formation. Results improved after he stopped tinkering with his starting eleven. The team&#x27;s creative outlet was the wings with Neymar and Messi as inside forwards flanking Suárez, a departure from their usual playing style. Ivan Rakitić played a pivotal role in transitioning defense to attack, and Andrés Iniesta&#x27;s influence withered, while Xavi, the club&#x27;s captain, reduced to a part-time, substitute role. With overlapping full-backs offering width, Neymar and Messi often drifted in-field, encouraging midfielders, Rakitic and Iniesta, to move into channels and attack in and around the box. In his third and final year, struggling for form and results, the manager switched to a 3–4–3 offense morphing into a 4–4–2 defensive shape, reminiscent of Antonio Conte&#x27;s Premier League winners Chelsea more than Johan Cryuff&#x27;s Dream Team, with Messi at the top of a midfield diamond, acting as chief play-maker, and Sergio Busquets, the sole holding defensive midfielder, responsible for breaking the first-line of opposition press. The system favoured Neymar in particular, who played as a left forward, often cutting inside to link with lone striker Suárez, or to create an overload in the final-third sharing creative responsibilities with Messi. This change in formation was instrumental as they overcame 0–4, the biggest first-leg deficit in Champions League history, by defeating PSG 6–1 in the second-leg; however, the physical and tactical discipline required to sustain a 3–4–3 proved controversial.

Luis Enrique continued to favour 4–3–3 for Spain, and at times the riskier 3–4–3 when the situation demands, with the sole defensive midfielder in the pivot being the only commonality. Lacking the front three he had at Barcelona, his football retains positional and vertical aspects, though with box-to-box central midfielders, like Koke or Pedri, offering attacking thrust while the center forward drops deep to bring wide forwards into play, accompanied by overlapping full-backs who offer width. Whilst pressing oppositions high-up, the center forward, usually Álvaro Morata, screens the opposition defensive midfielder as wide forwards engage opposition center backs. Spain&#x27;s defensive midfielder, often Busquets, tracks the run of opposition attackers when they drop deep, some times pressing higher than the team&#x27;s other central midfielders. In possession, Spain usually start playing out from the back, to draw the opposition in, with Thiago Alcântara or any other central midfielder, dropping alongside Busquets to help progress the ball forward. Should the opposition press aggressively, the full-backs link up to offer additional passing options as the center backs go deep and narrow. Wide forwards make diagonal runs into the midfield to link play with those in front of them. Once the ball has been progressed out of the defense, they adjust their attacking rhythm to match opposition&#x27;s defensive structure, either opting for a speedy transition against a higher block or relying on a more positional approach play against a lower block. To mix it up, Spain initially build up short in the defensive-third to then play long to the center forward who then attempts to bring outfield runners in to play. Wing play is used to stretch opposition and create spaces infield or create crossing opportunities, especially against compact defenses.

Known for his brave and fearless management style, Luis Enrique is quick to curb out source of any influence that undermines his authority. Reports of his altercation with Messi at Barcelona and with Totti at Roma, both of whom wield considerable power at their respective clubs, being prime examples of that. His flexibility in adopting different playing styles, while at odds with the possession-based style synonymous with Barcelona, furthered this narrative, as he continued to remain unfazed in the face of criticism and pressure. Royal Spanish Football Federation president Luis Rubiales, on the back of three consecutive unsuccessful tournaments, appointed him to curb ill-discipline and complacency in the squad, stating: &quot;We are looking for an incontestable leader, who sets out the path, and nobody then strays from that path.&quot;

===Reception===
Messi described Luis Enrique as one of the two best managers he has played for, the other being Guardiola. While Guardiola maintains that though he has played against many great footballing sides as a manager, Luis Enrique&#x27;s Barcelona and Jürgen Klopp&#x27;s Liverpool were the best he has ever faced.

In comparing the managers he has played for, Spain international Alcântara said, &quot;[Luis Enrique] has the analytical positioning of Pep [and] the aggressiveness of Klopp&quot; while also praising Enrique&#x27;s communication skills in conveying his footballing ideas.

==Endorsements==
Luis Enrique was sponsored by sportswear company Nike, and appeared in commercials for the brand. In a global advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, he starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside footballers such as Luís Figo, Thierry Henry, Hidetoshi Nakata, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Totti, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

==Personal life==
After retiring from football, Luis Enrique lived for a while in Australia to practice surfing. He took part in the 2005 edition of the New York City Marathon, finished the Amsterdam Marathon in 2006, the Firenze Marathon in 2007 and the &quot;Marathon des Sables&quot; in 2008, while also entering and finishing Frankfurt Ironman in 2007. He was due to take part in the Klagenfurt Ironman competition in July 2008, but eventually declined due to his engagement as manager of Barcelona B.

Luis Enrique married his longtime partner Elena Cullell on 27 December 1997. Their daughter, Xana, died of bone cancer at age 9 on 29 August 2019.

<doc id="616597" wikidata="Q3327188" url="?curid=616597" title="Mister X (Marvel Comics)">
<text>Mister X is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was introduced in &quot;Wolverine&quot; vol. 2 #159 (Feb. 2001). His henchmen include T &amp; A (nicknamed &quot;Betty and Veronica&quot; by Wolverine), and Blok.

==Fictional character biography==
Mister X is an extremely wealthy businessman who has demonstrated a psychological addiction to killing that, by his own account, started in his adolescence. His latent telepathic power was awakened by seeing a woman who had been hit by a car, which fascinated him; he felt her die. He soon became obsessed with death.

As a youth, X committed several murders to recreate the high of telepathically connecting with another person at the moment of their death. He murdered his pet dog by locking it in an oven, followed soon after by his entire family, including his mother and father. Over the years X would commit hundreds of murders and had his identity erased. Using his family&#x27;s considerable fortune, X traveled throughout the world and studied under some of the finest martial artists in the world. After X learned all he could from each of his teachers, he would kill them. The thrill of killing an opponent in hand-to-hand combat provided him with a rush that he had never dreamed of. X kept a public image of a handsome, single, wealthy socialite, while he secretly coveted the honor of being the greatest hand to hand combat fighter on earth, which, of course, meant killing all of the other greatest fighters.
For every murder, X would cut a scar somewhere on his body. By the time he met Wolverine, his torso was covered in hundreds of them arranged in an ornate pattern. X defeated Wolverine in their first battle, but was amazed at his opponent&#x27;s skills, bravery, and tenacity. X told Wolverine the story of his life up to that point, and then offered to spare Wolverine&#x27;s life if he would agree to sign over the rights to the title of &#x27;The Best There Is&#x27; and join his new murder avant-garde, much as T and A and Blok had done. Wolverine refused and engaged X in battle once again. This time, hearing of X&#x27;s crimes and the lives he had destroyed over the years, pushed Wolverine over the edge, and he slipped into a berserker rage. While in this state, Wolverine&#x27;s conscious mind essentially shut down and the primal, savage instincts brought on by his mutation took over. Even though X stabbed and slashed him with swords and knives, impaled him with a spear, shot him with a machine gun, and set him on fire with a flamethrower, Wolverine continued to fight. In the end, Wolverine&#x27;s determination and healing powers proved too much for X to overcome. X himself received several severe injuries, including deep lacerations down the length of his chest and stomach. He would have been killed had his bodyguard, Blok, not interfered.

Their third and final battle, at the Bloodsport tournament, went similarly. X had just defeated Taskmaster in a steel cage match, with Taskmaster surviving only due to a referee declaring the bout over upon X leaving the cage and preventing X from re-entering to finish his opponent off (X murders the referee for robbing him of his kill). At first, the battle appeared to be going in a similar direction as their first. No matter what Wolverine did, X was immediately prepared with a counter to Wolverine&#x27;s offense. Wolverine noted to himself that X&#x27;s movements, his technique, and form were absolutely flawless.

During this time, the Taskmaster (frustrated by the humiliating defeat he had suffered) attempted to kill X by firing an incendiary arrow at him from underneath the ring in which he and Wolverine were fighting. Wolverine&#x27;s enhanced senses alerted him to Taskmaster&#x27;s presence and allowed him to anticipate the attack, which would have harmed him as well, and allowed him to get out of the way before it hit. To Wolverine&#x27;s surprise, X also moved out of harm&#x27;s way, as though he had also sensed the danger. As the fire from the arrow spread across the ring, temporarily separating the two combatants, Wolverine recalled X telling him that he had been able to feel a girl die when he was younger. Reminded of how Jean Grey had learned of her powers (by reading the mind of her childhood friend Annie when Annie was killed in a car accident in front of her), Wolverine surmised that X must have telepathic abilities enabling him to predict his opponent&#x27;s moves. The natural solution to such a talent is not to think while fighting; to slip into a berserker fury as he had done during their second fight. He allowed himself to slip into a berserker rage and the tide immediately changed. Despite his skill, X was unable to predict Wolverine&#x27;s moves. Wolverine, who is a highly skilled martial artist himself, soon had the advantage. The ring eventually collapsed but not before Wolverine had knocked X into one of the corners containing the championship belt. X picked up the belt and declared that he had won the match, which was technically true according to the rules of the tournament. Despite this, Wolverine was poised to deliver the death blow but Blok, once again, saved X&#x27;s life.

Frustrated at his first real loss- aware that he only won his last fight against Wolverine via a technicality, Mister X spent several months training against other martial artists to re-learn how to fight without relying on his opponents&#x27; conscious thoughts to guide him, culminating in him killing a kindergarten teacher and challenging Wolverine to face him in the Museum of Natural History or he would kill the teacher&#x27;s students. However, during the fight, Wolverine determined that Mister X&#x27;s desire for the thrill of the fight could be used against him; he stopped fighting and took everything Mister X threw at him since his healing factor easily repaired the damage. After his opponent tired out, Wolverine simply led the students to safety, knowing that Mister X would be forced to live with the humiliation of his greatest foe defeating him on his own terms.

===Thunderbolts===
The Thunderbolts are sent after Mister X by Norman Osborn. The Black Widow briefs them about Mister X, who informs them that he will be attending Madripoor&#x27;s opera house with Tyger Tiger, and that the Black Widow and Paladin will pretend to be ballet dancers. Stun guns are teleported into the disguised Thunderbolts, and Mister X moves in to intercept them. As the witnesses flee, the Thunderbolts reveal that their assassination attempt was a sham, and that Mister X had arranged to meet them there. A body double is teleported in, and incinerated to cover Mister X&#x27;s disappearance, and he is welcomed as the newest member of the Thunderbolts. He reveals that he does not need Osborn&#x27;s money, and is looking for a challenge, but the downtime between missions becomes frustrating for him, prompting him to hijack a teleporter and jump into a South American warzone to kill the guerilla fighters in the area. With great pleasure, Mr. X later participated in the &quot;Siege&quot; crossover, fighting and even killing Asgardians. After Osborn was proven defeated, Mr. X briefly possessed the Spear of Odin, but was savagely beaten and disarmed by Quicksilver, who openly mocked Mister X&#x27;s inability to hurt him despite Quicksilver&#x27;s limited hand-to-hand combat experience. Mr. X disappeared before being arrested.

==Powers and abilities==
Mister X possesses low-level psychic abilities; his nervous system automatically maps onto the neural motor-function precursors of anyone in close proximity, allowing him to reflexively predict their moves and counter them effortlessly. The combination of his skills and these psychic powers was sufficient for X to defeat the Taskmaster, who is one of the finest combatants on Earth, and made it look easy.

However his psychic ability has its limits as he was unable to match the speed of Quicksilver&#x27;s attacks. His lack of superhuman physical powers contributes greatly to his unwillingness to confront genuine superhuman opponents such as Spider-Man, Luke Cage, or the Hulk, as their vastly superior physical abilities would render his ability to predict their actions useless; Quicksilver mocked him for this by referring to him as &quot;the least dangerous man on the planet.&quot; Wolverine has also managed to defeat X in combat by provoking himself into a berserker rage while they fight, thus preventing X from predicting what Wolverine will do next as Wolverine himself is unaware what he shall attempt in that state; Iron Fist has also managed to defeat him in a confrontation by relying on the unpredictable Drunken Fist style of kung-fu.

X possesses the physical capabilities of a man that is in the peak of physical condition. His physical abilities of strength, speed, stamina, agility, dexterity, reflexes and reactions, coordination, balance, and endurance are on par with those of Captain America. Mr. X claims to be a master of every earthly form of martial arts and some alien fighting styles including Kree and Shi&#x27;ar. Mr. X is also highly proficient with a variety of weaponry including swords, knives, staffs, and firearms. He also has an uncanny tolerance for physical pain and may be a masochist.

==In other media==
Mister X is listed as an opponent who will be facing Ken Masters in a martial arts tournament depicted in Ryu&#x27;s ending for &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot;.

<doc id="616598" wikidata="Q223158" url="?curid=616598" title="Josef Masopust">
<text>Josef Masopust (9 February 1931 – 29 June 2015) was a Czech football player and coach. He played as midfielder and was a key player for Czechoslovakia, helping them reach the 1962 FIFA World Cup Final. He was capped 63 times, scoring ten goals for his national team.

He was named European Footballer of the Year in 1962. In November 2003, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, Masopust was selected as his country&#x27;s Golden Player by the Football Association of the Czech Republic as their most outstanding player of the past 50 years. He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. He is regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time.

==Club career==
Masopust&#x27;s first club was lowly &quot;ZSJ Uhlomost Most&quot;, but &quot;ZSJ Technomat Teplice&quot; (renamed to &quot;ZSJ Vodotechna Teplice&quot; in 1951) signed him as a 19-year-old left-half and gave him his top-flight debut. Then, in 1952, he joined a Czechoslovak Armed Forces football club under name of &quot;ATK Praha&quot; (renamed to &quot;ÚDA Praha&quot; in 1953 and to Dukla Prague in winter 1956). Masopust won eight league championships and three national cups with Dukla. They also reached the semi-finals of the 1966–67 European Cup, losing to the eventual winners of the competition (Celtic).

When he eventually went abroad in 1968, he helped Crossing Molenbeek win promotion to the Belgian first division as player-coach. His coaching career continued at Dukla, however his only Czechoslovak league title as a coach came with Zbrojovka Brno in the 1977–78 season. Later, between 1984 and 1987, he led the Czechoslovakia national team, overseeing a total of 27 matches. He subsequently had a spell in Indonesia where he coached their national Olympic football team with Milan Bokša between 1988 and 1991.

==International career==
Masopust made his international debut in October 1954, in a friendly match against Hungary. He helped Czechoslovakia qualify for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, but the team were knocked out after a play-off match against Northern Ireland. He then went on to finish the 1955-60 Central European International Cup as winner in 1960. Czechoslovakia then finished in third place in the new tournament 1960 UEFA European Football Championship, losing to the Soviet Union in the semi-final and defeating France in the third place match.

In 1962, Masopust led the Czechoslovakia team that reached the 1962 FIFA World Cup Final, losing to Brazil. He scored the opening goal in the Final, but Brazil came back to win 3–1. Because of his performance at the World Cup Finals, he was named European Footballer of the Year in 1962.

Having represented the Rest of the World team against England in 1963, Masopust was invited to play for a European International XI in the farewell match for Stanley Matthews, when the 50-year-old Matthews retired from football in 1965. Czechoslovakia failed to qualify for the 1966 World Cup; Masopust had only played in one qualification match, a 1–0 defeat against Romania in May 1965. His last international appearance was in May 1966, in a friendly match against the Soviet Union. Overall, he was capped 63 times for his national team, scoring ten goals.

==Style of play==
Early in his career, Masopust played as a left half. By the time of the 1962 World Cup, he had moved to the centre half position.

Masopust was in a similar mould to that of the Hungarian József Bozsik; a workhorse of his team, who also created attacking opportunities. He had excellent ball control, which he utilised for both recovering the ball in defence and dribbling past opponents. Like Bozsik, Masopust was also an excellent passer of the ball. He was not great at tackling opponents, but he compensated for this by anticipating his opponents&#x27; actions and intercepting their passes.

Shackled by Czechoslovakia&#x27;s &quot;no-risk&quot; style philosophy, Masopust&#x27;s natural inclination for attack was limited, yet he still managed ten goals in 63 caps for his national team. At club level, he scored 79 times in 386 appearances for Dukla Prague. Many of his Dukla teammates also played for the national team, which gave them a greater understanding than some of their opponents.

==Legacy==
A statue of Masopust was built outside Dukla&#x27;s Stadion Juliska and was unveiled in June 2011.

==Death==
Masopust died on 29 June 2015 at his home in Prague at the age of 84. Although no cause of death was given, Czech Television stated that he had been fighting an unspecified long, serious illness.

<text>The argenteus ( argentei, &#x27;of silver&#x27;) was a silver coin produced by the Roman Empire from the time of Diocletian&#x27;s coinage reform in AD 294 to ca. AD 310. It was of similar weight and fineness to the denarius of the time of Nero. The coin was produced at a theoretical weight of 1/96th of a Roman pound (about 3 grams), as indicated by the Roman numeral XCVI on the coin&#x27;s reverse.

One aureus equaled 25 argentei and one argenteus equaled 8 folles.

The term &quot;argenteus&quot;, meaning &quot;of silver&quot; in Latin, was first used in Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; in the phrase &quot;argenteus nummus&quot; (silver coin). The 4th-century historian Ammianus uses the same phrase, though there is no indication that this is the official name for a denomination. The &quot;Historia Augusta&quot; uses the phrase to refer to several fictitious coins.

<doc id="616605" wikidata="Q171295" url="?curid=616605" title="Pavel Nedvěd">
<text>Pavel Nedvěd (; born 30 August 1972) is a Czech former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest Czech players of all time and he won numerous trophies with Italian clubs Lazio and Juventus. He won the last ever Cup Winners&#x27; Cup with Lazio and led Juventus to the 2003 UEFA Champions League final.

Nedvěd was a vital player in the Czech team that reached the final of Euro 1996 and afterwards he attracted the attention of big European clubs. He also captained the team at UEFA Euro 2004, where they were defeated in the semi-final by eventual champions Greece, and Nedvěd was named in the Team of the Tournament. Furthermore, Nedvěd helped his team qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup for the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia. Due to his quick and energetic runs during matches, Nedvěd was nicknamed &quot;&quot; (&quot;Czech Fury&quot;) by Italian football fans. His nickname in Czech is &quot;Méďa&quot; (&quot;Little Bear&quot;), stemming from the similarity between his surname and the Czech word for bear, &quot;Medvěd&quot;.

Winning the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2003, Nedvěd was the second Czech player to win the award and the first since the breakup of Czechoslovakia. During his career, Nedvěd received many other individual awards, including the second Golden Foot award in 2004, Czech Footballer of the Year (four times), and the Golden Ball (six times). He was also named by Pelé as one of the FIFA 100 and was named in the UEFA Team of the Year in 2003, 2004, and 2005. Nedvěd retired from professional football after the 2008–09 season. Nedvěd played 501 league matches at club level (scoring 110 goals) and was capped 91 times for the Czech Republic (scoring 18 goals).

== Club career ==

=== Skoda Plzen and Dukla Prague loan spell ===
Born on 30 August 1972 in Cheb and raised in nearby Skalná, Nedvěd began his football career in his native Czechoslovakia. A football fan from an early age, he began playing for his hometown club Tatran Skalná in 1977 at the age of five. Nedvěd moved on to Rudá Hvězda Cheb in 1985, playing one season before spending five years with Škoda Plzeň. In 1990, Nedvěd was loaned to Dukla Prague, a club run by the Army, as part of his military service. During his first year at Dukla Prague, he played for , a lower division club also operated by the Army. On 28 October 1991, Nedvěd played his first match for Dukla Prague. He played one season for Dukla in 1991 before finishing his military service, thus ending his loan from Plzeň. He then transferred to Sparta Prague in 1992. Plzeň was to receive 30% of the transfer fee should Nedvěd transfer to a foreign club.

===Sparta Prague===
Early in his career at Sparta, Nedvěd was sent off three times in just six matches. With Sparta, Nedvěd won one Czechoslovak First League title, two Gambrinus liga titles and a Czech Cup. In 1994, he received his first call up to the Czech Republic national team. His performance at UEFA Euro 1996, including a goal in the group stage against Italy, attracted attention; despite a verbal agreement with PSV, Nedvěd moved from Sparta Prague to Italian Serie A club Lazio. Sparta first sold Nedvěd to Slovak club 1. FC Košice (which had the same owner as Sparta) for a 1.5 million CZK transfer fee, and immediately, Košice sold Nedvěd to Lazio. Thus Sparta paid only a small fraction of the transfer fee to Plzeň. After Plzeň&#x27;s protest, the Czech football association ordered Sparta to pay Plzeň 35 million CZK in compensation.

Nedvěd signed a four-year contract for a fee of ₤1.2 million.

=== Lazio ===
Nedvěd made his league debut for Lazio on 7 September 1996 in a 1–0 away defeat against Bologna. He scored his first league goal for the club against Cagliari on 20 October 1996, finishing the 1996–97 season with seven goals. He became an integral part of the side, scoring four goals in three matches early in the 1997–98 season. The club had a 24-match unbeaten streak from November 1997 to April 1998, ending with a league match against Juventus in which Nedvěd was sent off. That season, Lazio won the 1997–98 Coppa Italia and reached the final of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. Nedvěd and Lazio began the 1998–99 season with a victory in the Supercoppa Italiana, Nedvěd scoring as the club defeated Juventus 2–1. He played a role in Lazio&#x27;s road to the last-ever Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, scoring against Lausanne in the first round and in both legs of Lazio&#x27;s 7–0 aggregate quarter-final victory over Panionios. In the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final, Nedvěd scored the decisive goal against Mallorca for Lazio&#x27;s 2–1 victory. This proved to be the last goal of the tournament, which was later discontinued.

Nedvěd was one of the ten highest-paid footballers in the Italian league in 1999. He played in the 1999 UEFA Super Cup against Manchester United at the beginning of the season, where Lazio won the match by a single goal. The club went on to win the Serie A title and Coppa Italia, completing a domestic double in 2000 with Nedvěd&#x27;s help. In 2000, he won the Supercoppa Italiana with Lazio for a second time. With Siniša Mihajlović, Nedvěd was one of two Lazio players sent off in the quarter-final of the 2000 Coppa Italia held in December, where the defending champions lost 5–3 on aggregate to Udinese.

Nedvěd played UEFA Champions League football with Lazio, scoring against Real Madrid in a 2–2 draw in the second group stage before the Italian side was eliminated. In Lazio&#x27;s final Champions League match of the season, Nedvěd was criticised by Leeds United manager David O&#x27;Leary for a challenge on Alan Maybury (although the referee did not call a foul), and he received a three-match suspension from European competitions from UEFA.

Despite Nedvěd&#x27;s signing a new four-year contract with Lazio in April 2001, the club tried to sell him and teammate Juan Sebastián Verón that summer, triggering fan protests against club chairman Sergio Cragnotti. The players were ultimately sold to Juventus and Manchester United respectively.

=== Juventus ===

After five seasons with Lazio, Nedvěd was speculatively linked to several clubs (including Manchester United and Chelsea) before moving to Juventus in July 2001 for 75 billion lire (€38.7 million by fixed exchange rate). At Juventus, he replaced Zinedine Zidane, who had transferred to Real Madrid that summer. Nedvěd was a regular on Juventus&#x27; 2001–02 and 2002–03 &quot;Scudetto&quot;-winning teams. Although he was a substantial part of the club&#x27;s championship season in 2003, he was also the subject of controversy. Nedvěd quit the Italian Footballers&#x27; Association in protest of the union&#x27;s limit on non-European Union (EU) players; his native Czech Republic did not become an EU member until 2004. Although he was instrumental in leading Juventus to the 2003 UEFA Champions League final against Milan, he had to sit out the final due to an accumulation of yellow cards after his semi-final booking for a foul on Real Madrid midfielder Steve McManaman.

In December 2003, Nedvěd was named World Footballer of the Year by &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine. Later that month, he won the European Footballer of the Year award over Thierry Henry and Paolo Maldini, the second Czech to win the award after Josef Masopust in 1962. Nedvěd received further recognition in his home country when he won the 2004 Golden Ball, awarded by Czech sportswriters, for the fifth time in seven years.

The 2004–05 season was frustrating for the midfielder, who was sidelined for two months by knee and head injuries and first considered retirement in April 2005. Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006, the titles were revoked after the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; match fixing scandal. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Juventus&#x27; relegation from Serie A despite its first-place finish, many stars (such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram) left the club and the remaining players&#x27; future was uncertain. After the 2006 World Cup, Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A, citing his family and his commitment to the club as reasons for his decision. He received a five-match ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006, and repeated his threat to retire. However, he remained with the club until the end of the season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006–07 Serie B.
For the 2007–08 season, Juventus again played in Serie A. Nedvěd played frequently for the &quot;Bianconeri&quot;, contributing as the team&#x27;s first-choice left winger and scoring two goals that season. He was again controversial: in November 2007, his tackle of Inter Milan midfielder Luís Figo broke Figo&#x27;s fibula. In April 2008, Nedvěd was hospitalised overnight for a concussion sustained in a collision with Roberto Guana during a match against Palermo.

Nedvěd scored Juventus&#x27; first league goal of the 2008–09 season in a 1–1 away draw with Fiorentina, and scored twice against Bologna in a 2–1 away win in October. On 26 February 2009, Nedvěd announced he would retire at the end of 2008–09 season to spend more time with his family. On 10 March 2009, he was substituted due to injury after 12 minutes of the Champions League round of 16 second leg match against Chelsea. Due to his impending retirement and his club&#x27;s 3–2 loss on aggregate, it was his last European match for Juventus. Nedvěd retired at the end of the season, captaining the final match against former team Lazio and setting up Vincenzo Iaquinta&#x27;s goal for a 2–0 victory. As of April 2024, Nedvěd has made the most appearances for the Turin side as a non–Italian player (327).

=== FK Skalná ===
On 23 September 2017, Nedvěd transferred to FK Skalná, based in his native village of Skalná. The club plays in the 1. B class of in the Karlovy Vary Region (7th level of Czech football hierarchy). Chairman of the club had said: &quot;It was Pavel&#x27;s dream to play with his son and now it will come true&quot;. He further added that it seems likely that his planned fielding on 2 June 2018 in a home fixture against TJ Baník Královské Poříči B is a one-off event, due to Nědved&#x27;s residency in Italy and employment as vice-president of Juventus. Nedvěd was in the starting line-up, but Skalná lost the home fixture 1–4, and neither Nedvěd nor his son scored a goal.

==International career==
Nedvěd began playing for Czechoslovakia national youth teams in 1988, representing his country in the under-15 age group before progressing to 16, 17 and 18. In 1992, he debuted for the under-21 team, playing seven times between 1992 and 1993.

Nedvěd debuted for the reformed Czech Republic national team in June 1994 in a 3–1 victory over the Republic of Ireland. His first major tournament was Euro 1996, where he scored his first senior international goal and helped his team reach the final.

===Euro 1996===
The Czech Republic were not expected to make an impact against the favoured Germany side in their opening match; Nedvěd missed two scoring chances and was one of ten players to receive a yellow card as Germany won 2–0. However, he contributed defensively, clearing a goal-bound shot from Christian Ziege off the line.

Nedvěd scored his first senior international goal in his nation&#x27;s Group C match against Italy, putting the Czech Republic in the lead 1–0 after four minutes. Although Italy scored an equaliser during the first half, they were reduced to ten men and the Czech Republic scored again before half-time for a 2–1 victory. Nedvěd played in the third group match, against Russia, receiving his second yellow card of the tournament as the Czechs tied 3–3 to advance to the knockout stage.

Due to a suspension, Nedvěd missed the Czech Republic&#x27;s quarter-final match against Portugal. The Czechs won in his absence and progressed. In the semi-final against France, Nedvěd was named man of the match as the Czech Republic advanced to the final after a penalty shoot–out, where he scored his nation&#x27;s second penalty shot. He and the Czech Republic team lost 2–1 in the final to Germany, who scored a golden goal.

=== Euro 2000 ===
Before Euro 2000, Nedvěd could not train normally due to an ankle injury. The Czechs&#x27; first match (against the Netherlands) saw him and international teammate Jan Koller hit the woodwork without scoring, before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1–0. In the second match, against France, he was fouled, where the resultant Czech penalty was converted by Karel Poborský to even the score at 1–1. Despite two shots on goal, Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2–1. Already eliminated after two matches, he played in the third group match, against Denmark; the Czechs achieved a 2–0 victory. After Euro 2000, Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří Němec.

===Euro 2004===
Nedvěd was instrumental in the Euro 2004 group stage match against the Netherlands. With two goals down after 19 minutes, he gave a man of the match performance as the Czechs rebounded to win 3–2. Nine players, including Nedvěd, were rested for the group match against Germany, with the Czechs already qualified for the knockout stage. He received a yellow card, upheld on appeal, in the quarter-final match against Denmark. This meant Nedvěd would miss the final if he received another yellow card in the semi-final against Greece. However, Greece defeated the Czechs and Nedvěd was substituted after a knee injury. After their exit from the tournament, Nedvěd announced his retirement from the national team; he was named to the Team of the Tournament alongside countrymen Petr Čech and Milan Baroš.

===2006 World Cup===
Nedvěd was persuaded by coach Karel Brückner and his teammates to come out of international retirement in time for the 2006 World Cup qualification playoffs against Norway, in which the Czech Republic qualified for the final tournament for the first time since the breakup of Czechoslovakia. Although Nedvěd&#x27;s World Cup participation was jeopardised by a June knee injury, he was able to play.

The Czechs won the first match of the 2006 World Cup 3–0 against the United States, but key players were injured. They later lost their next two group matches against Ghana and eventual winners Italy, finishing third in their group. Nedvěd&#x27;s apparent goal at the beginning of the second half in the match against Ghana was ruled offside. His shots on goal against Italy were saved by Juventus teammate Gianluigi Buffon. Nedvěd again announced his retirement from the international scene before the August 2006 friendly match against Serbia, in which he made his 91st and final appearance. He refused to reverse his decision before Euro 2008 despite requests from teammates and Brückner. In total, Nedvěd made 91 appearances and scored 18 goals.

== Style of play ==
Nedvěd is widely regarded as one of the greatest Czech players of all time. He mainly played as a wide midfielder or as a left-winger due to his crossing ability with his left foot and his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot. He also occasionally played as a playmaker due to his passing range and vision. He is also known for his powerful and accurate strikes as well as his explosive pace, the latter of which allowed him to make deep runs from midfield. He was also an accurate free-kick and penalty kick taker.

Nedvěd was known for his trademark long blonde hair, which made him a highly recognisable player on the pitch, and was known for his tackling and work-rate, which allowed him to win possession of the ball and provide stability to the defenders. His former Lazio boss Sven-Göran Eriksson described him as &quot;an atypical midfielder, totally complete&quot;. Despite his ability, Nedvěd&#x27;s tenacious playing style and disciplinary record has been criticised by the football media, who accused him of being overly aggressive in his tackles; he has also been accused of diving.

== Post-playing career ==

Nedvěd ran the Prague Half Marathon in 2010 (his first marathon) and finished the course in a time of 1:49:44. He ran the 2012 Prague Marathon in a time of 3:50:02.

Nedvěd was named International Personality at the 2012 FAI International Football Awards in February. In January 2013, he was banned from attending Serie A matches for three weeks after he insulted referee Paolo Valeri during Juventus&#x27; match against Sampdoria.

===Directorship===
On 12 October 2010, Exor (the Agnelli family&#x27;s investment company) nominated Nedvěd to be part of Juventus&#x27; board of directors. On 23 October 2015, Nedvěd was appointed vice chairman of the board of directors.

On 28 November 2022, the entire Juventus board of directors resigned due to the &quot;Plusvalenza&quot; scandal, in which Juventus had committed capital gain violations. On 20 January 2023, Nedvěd was suspended from holding office in Italian football for eight months due to his involvement in the scandal.

On 8 January 2025, Nedvěd became sporting director of Saudi club Al Shabab.

== Personal life ==
Nedvěd has lived with his wife Ivana since 1992. The couple have two children who are named Ivana and Pavel after their parents. The couple split in 2019 and Nedvěd started dating an equestrian. Nedvěd&#x27;s 2010 autobiography was published in Italian as &#x27;. It was translated into Czech as &#x27; and released in the Czech Republic in 2011.

<text>Rinat Fayzrakhmanovich Dasayev (, ; born 13 June 1957) is a Russian football coach and a former goalkeeper.

Throughout his club career, he played for Volgar Astrakhan, Spartak Moscow and Sevilla. At international level, he played at three World Cups with the Soviet national team, also winning a bronze medal at the 1980 Summer Olympics and a runners-up medal at UEFA Euro 1988.

Regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the world during the 1980s, he is considered the second-best Soviet goalkeeper ever behind Lev Yashin. He was awarded the title of the World’s Best Goalkeeper of the Year award in 1988 by the IFFHS. In a 1999 poll by the same organisation, he was elected the sixteenth greatest European goalkeeper of the twentieth century, alongside Gianpiero Combi, and the seventeenth greatest goalkeeper of the century. In 2004, he was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers.

Following his retirement, he worked as a coach, and currently serves as a goalkeeping consultant with FC Spartak-2 Moscow and Spartak&#x27;s youth teams.

==Club career==
Dasayev played as a goalkeeper for the Russian football club Spartak Moscow during most of the 1980s. He won the Soviet championship in 1979 and 1987 and was named Best Soviet Goalkeeper by &quot;Ogonyok&quot; (&quot;Огонëк&quot;) magazine in 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1988. In 1982, he was named Soviet Footballer of the Year. After his contract ran out with the Spanish club Sevilla FC in the early 1990s, Dasayev retired from the sport.

==International career==
Dasayev played for the Soviet national team at the 1980 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. He appeared in the 1982, 1986 and 1990 FIFA World Cups, as well as the Euro 88, where the Soviet Union reached the final, only to lose out to the Netherlands. In total, he was capped 91 times from 1979 to 1990, being the second-most capped player ever for the Soviet Union.

==Style of play==
Nicknamed &quot;The Iron Curtain&quot; and &quot;The Cat&quot;, Dasayev is considered to be one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and one of the best players in the world in his position during the 1980s; he is also regarded as the second-best Russian goalkeeper ever after Yashin. In addition to his shot-stopping abilities as a goalkeeper, Dasayev was also known for his trademark sudden long throws, which he would make immediately after stopping a shot, in order to start quick counter-attacks from the back; he was also known for his particular diving technique, which often saw him attempt saves with only one arm, in a similar manner to his Italian contemporary Franco Tancredi. A tall and well-rounded goalkeeper with a slender physique, he possessed an excellent positional sense, and often positioned himself in very deep positions, rarely straying from his goal-line, and preferring to remain between the posts throughout the course of a match. He was also known for his efficient, rather than spectacular, playing style, as well as his ability to organise his defence. Considered to be the goalkeeping heir of Lev Yashin in Soviet football, he often drew wide praise for his ability in the press. However, critical opinion of Dasayev was occasionally divided; Italian sports journalist Gianni Brera, for example, believed that he was overrated in the media.

==After retirement==
Dasayev retired from professional football in the early 1990s, following his time with Sevilla. In 2001, he traveled to Vietnam to play some friendly matches between legend players of Spartak Moscow and Hanoi XI, which ended 3–3. He was appointed as the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final Ambassador. Dasayev was a member of Russia&#x27;s committee that won the bid to hold the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Unlike most of other legends and football pundits in Russia following Russia&#x27;s quarter-finals feat in 2018 World Cup, Dasayev criticized the Russian team and believed quarter-finals can&#x27;t be considered as an achievement.

He had to retire from active coaching in late 2018 due to knee injuries and currently works as goalkeeping consultant with FC Spartak-2 Moscow and Spartak&#x27;s youth teams.

==Personal life==
Dasayev is a Muslim.

<text>Patricia de Lille (née Lindt; born 17 February 1951) is a South African politician who is the current Minister of Tourism and leader of the political party Good. She served as Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure from 2019 to 2023.

She was previously Mayor of Cape Town from 2011 to 2018 and before that, Western Cape Provincial Minister of Social Development from 2010 to 2011. She founded and led the Independent Democrats (ID), a political party which she formed in 2003 during a floor-crossing window, after she broke away from the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). In August 2010, the ID merged with the Democratic Alliance, South Africa&#x27;s official opposition, and the party was officially dissolved in 2014. From 2015 to 2017, she was Provincial Leader of the Democratic Alliance in the Western Cape.

De Lille was selected as the DA&#x27;s mayoral candidate in Cape Town, defeating incumbent Dan Plato, ahead of the 2011 local government elections, where she was elected mayor. She was re-elected to a second term as mayor in the 2016 local government elections. 
De Lille was voted 22nd in the Top 100 Great South Africans, and is noted for her role in investigations into the country&#x27;s controversial Arms Deal.

On 8 May 2018, the DA&#x27;s Federal Executive ceased De Lille&#x27;s party membership, thereby removing her as mayor of the DA governed city. The Western Cape High Court temporarily suspended her removal. On 5 August 2018, De Lille announced her intention to resign as Mayor of Cape Town. She resigned as mayor and terminated her DA party membership on 31 October 2018.

Consequently, she formed Good in December 2018, and was announced as the party&#x27;s Western Cape Premier candidate in February 2019. She was elected to Parliament in May 2019 and took office as a Member on 22 May 2019. On 29 May 2019, De Lille was appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa as Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure. In March 2023, she became the Minister of Tourism and was reappointed on 30 June 2024.

==Background==

De Lille was born in 1951 in Beaufort West, and attended Bastiaanse Hoërskool. In 1974 she became a laboratory technician at a factory. She remained involved with the same company until 1990. During this time, she became involved in the South African Chemical Workers Union, starting off as a shop steward and then becoming regional secretary, before being elected as a National Executive Member in 1983. In 1988, she was elected as National Vice-President of The National Council of Trade Unions (NACTU), the highest position for a woman in the trade union movement at that time.

==Political career==

In 1989, De Lille was elected onto the National Executive Committee of the Pan Africanist Movement (PAM). She led a delegation in the constitutional negotiations that preceded South Africa&#x27;s first democratic election in 1994, and following her election as a Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) MP, she was appointed as Chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Transport from 1994 to 1999. She also served on various portfolio Committees including Health, Minerals and Energy, Trade and Industry, Communications, the Rules Committee and the Code of Ethics.

Later, she made use of parliamentary privilege to be a whistle-blower on the South African Arms Deal.

In 2003, De Lille made use of a floor crossing window to break with the PAC, and form her own party, the Independent Democrats.

==Issues==

=== Arms Deal===

De Lille led the call for an investigation into alleged corruption in South Africa&#x27;s purchase of weapons costing £4bn from British and other European manufacturers (that cost has soared on the basis of foreign currency collapses to more than its original cost although the Rand £ and Rand $ exchange rates have now reduced the costs to almost the same level as the original cost.). The government rejected De Lille&#x27;s calls for an independent inquiry to be led by Judge Willem Heath. De Lille said she was accused of being unpatriotic and embarrassing the country as a consequence of her efforts to investigate the Arms Deal.&quot;

On 5 April 2009, the Independent Democrats confirmed De Lille&#x27;s attendance at the announcement of the National Prosecuting Authority the following day regarding its decision either to drop or to maintain its case against ANC President Jacob Zuma, who had been implicated in the Arms Deal. In an op-ed for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, De Lille predicted that the charges would be dropped:

Am I angry? Of course I am angry. I am angry because the majority of our people are not seeing the warning signs that are coming from the ANC, a liberation party that has no respect for the Constitution and the rule of law and is prepared to erode both just so that one man can become the leader of our country.

By letting these ANC crooks off the hook we are sending entirely the wrong message to our people. Government is saying that there is a way out for those who break the law.

On the morning of the NPA&#x27;s much-awaited announcement, De Lille was turned away from proceedings, being told that, as a member of the public, she would have to find a television set. Leader of the Democratic Alliance Helen Zille was met with the same fate.

==Awards and recognition==

De Lille was awarded the Freedom of the City of Birmingham, Alabama, and in 2004 was awarded the honour of being one of the Top 5 Women in Government and Government Agencies. She was also awarded the 2004 Old Mutual South African Leadership Award in the Category of Woman Leadership.

De Lille was voted 22nd in the Top 100 Great South Africans, and is noted for her role in investigations into the country&#x27;s controversial Arms Deal.

In July 2006 she was the first woman to be recognised as Honorary Colonel of 84 Signal Unit in the South African National Defence Force. In August 2006 she received the City Press and Rapport Newspaper award as one of top 10 women in South Africa.

A Markinor survey conducted in 2004 found that De Lille was South Africa&#x27;s favourite politician after Thabo Mbeki.

==Joining the DA==

On 13 August 2010, after meetings with both the DA and ID executive, it was decided that the ID would indeed merge with the DA. On 15 August 2010, De Lille and DA Leader Helen Zille announced to the public that the ID would join the DA.

==Controversies==

During the 2004 general election, disgruntled former members of the Independent Democrats accused her of running the party in a &quot;undemocratic&quot; manner – in direct contrast with the image of transparency and accountability that she grounded her party on. De Lille told reporters that the dissenters had been fired from the party for fraud and corruption.

As Mayor of Cape Town, De Lille has been perceived to have had a conflict of interest regarding the private sector developments by friends of hers in Clifton. As mayor, De Lille was accused by businessman Anthony Faul of demanding a R5 million bribe so as to secure a procurement contract to supply fire extinguishers in 2013.

==Party infighting and resignation as Mayor of Cape Town==

In September 2017, De Lille controversially ordered that the City of Cape Town&#x27;s special investigations unit be closed against the wishes of the city&#x27;s committee member for safety, security and social services Jean-Pierre Smith. The closure of the investigative unit led to allegations that de Lille improperly benefited from security upgrades at public expense to her home. The security upgrades allegations were investigated by the auditor-general and dismissed.

Following the closure of the unit and a breakdown in the working relationship between De Lille and Smith, the Democratic Alliance charged De Lille with misconduct amid allegations against her of intimidation, criminality and misconduct.

On 15 February 2018, she survived a vote of no confidence by one vote (110 no votes, 109 yes votes and 3 abstentions). Following the no confidence vote, an internal vote within the DA caucus governing the City of Cape Town occurred on 25 April 2018. A majority of the DA councillors voted for the removal of De Lille as mayor.

On 8 May 2018, the DA&#x27;s Federal Executive terminated De Lille&#x27;s membership. Federal executive chairperson James Selfe said De Lille&#x27;s membership was terminated after an interview De Lille did with Radio 702 radio host Eusebius McKaiser, where she said that she would resign once she had cleared her name. Her expulsion from the Democratic Alliance meant that she could no longer remain as mayor of Cape Town. The Western Cape High Court temporarily suspended her removal, and heard arguments about her removal on 4–5 June 2018. The Cape Town City Council voted on 31 May 2018 to strip De Lille of her executive powers.
On 27 June 2018, the Western Cape High Court voted unanimously to reinstate De Lille&#x27;s party membership, finding that the DA had failed to follow its own constitution when it invoked its cessation clause against De Lille.
In July 2018, a vote of no confidence was scheduled, but was later withdrawn.

On 5 August 2018, the Democratic Alliance National Leader, Mmusi Maimane, announced at a joint news conference that the party had reached a &quot;mutual agreement&quot; with De Lille. The agreement being that De Lille would resign as Mayor of Cape Town and that the party would withdraw all internal charges against her. She would also remain a member of the Democratic Alliance. The announcement of her resignation came a day before the party&#x27;s disciplinary proceedings would have started.

In September 2018, the Democratic Alliance announced that Dan Plato would succeed De Lille. She left office on 31 October 2018. She also resigned as a member of the Democratic Alliance.

==Leader of Good and national government==

When De Lille resigned as Mayor of Cape Town, she mentioned that she would take two weeks off of public life, while she writes her book and evaluates her choices. It was suspected de Lille would either revive her old political party, the Independent Democrats, or either join the African National Congress or the Economic Freedom Fighters.

On 18 November 2018, De Lille launched the &quot;For Good&quot; political movement and website. She said at the event that she would form a new political party.

On 2 December 2018, De Lille announced the formation of a new political party named Good. Other disgruntled former Democratic Alliance members, such as Brett Herron and Shaun August, were present at the event. She also said that the political party is registered with the IEC and would contest the 2019 general election.

De Lille was announced as the Good Party&#x27;s Western Cape Premier candidate on 10 February 2019. On 16 February 2019, she officially launched the &quot;Aunty Pat for Premier Campaign&quot; in Wesbank near Delft outside Cape Town.

Following the May 2019 general elections, De Lille was sworn in as a Member of the National Assembly of South Africa, and was appointed Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure by President Cyril Ramaphosa.

During a cabinet reshuffle in March 2023, she was appointed as Minister of Tourism by President Cyril Ramaphosa.

In 2024 general election Good won one seat in Parliament (National Assembly) and Patricia de Lille was the sole Good elected MP.

In June 2024, Good agreed to join the ANC-led government of national unity (GNU). Leader of the Good, Patricia De Lille, continued as tourism minister in the coalition.

==Personal life==
De Lille&#x27;s husband, Edwin, died after a long illness on 7 February 2021. They were married for 49 years and had one son, Allistair.

<text>Emre Belözoğlu (, born 7 September 1980), simply known as Emre, is a Turkish football manager and former professional player who is currently serving as the head coach of Antalyaspor.

A midfielder, usually in a playmaker role, Belözoğlu came through the youth ranks at Galatasaray before making his senior debut at the age of 16 in 1996. After five years, four Süper Lig titles, one UEFA Cup and more than 100 appearances for Galatasaray, he moved to Inter Milan for £5 million and would subsequently play for Newcastle United, Fenerbahçe (where he won two Süper Lig titles), Atlético Madrid and İstanbul Başakşehir.

Belözoğlu was a part of the Turkey national team from 2000 to 2019, earning over 100 caps and helping the team to the semi-finals at the 2002 World Cup and at Euro 2008. He was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers as a part of FIFA&#x27;s centenary celebrations announced by Pelé.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Belözoğlu&#x27;s inspiration came from his father, Mehmet, who introduced him to football at the Zeytinburnuspor training ground. Belözoğlu&#x27;s mother, Fatma, had seen the problems that her husband had faced through his football career, and thus did not want their son to become a professional football player. His father, however, urged and inspired Belözoğlu to embark on a career.
The fans of Zeytinburnuspor quickly took an interest in him, stating his wonderful control of a left foot. Coach Salih Bulgurlu noticed his talent and started giving him special training. Bulgurlu looked after Belözoğlu for four years, teaching him all the basic techniques, improving and harnessing his fitness and stamina dramatically. Belözoğlu was quickly discovered by former Galatasaray legend Bülent Ünder, a close friend of Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim. Bülent Ünder pleaded to Bulgurlu that Emre join Galatasaray: &quot;Wait and see. In two years, this teenager will be playing proudly within the battlegrounds of Europe.&quot;

=== Galatasaray ===
Belözoğlu officially became a Galatasaray player. His first appearance for the club&#x27;s senior squad was as a sixteen-year-old in the 1996–97 season. The following year, he became a regular in the squad. Once he became a regular he won four Süper Lig titles, two Turkish Cups, one UEFA Cup, and one UEFA Super Cup all by the age of 21. Belözoğlu also played in the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid in April 2001.

===Inter Milan===
In 2001, he moved to Inter Milan for £5 million. In the 2002–03 season, Belözoğlu became the 17th winner of the &quot;Pirata d&#x27;Oro (Golden Pirate)&quot;, an annual award given for the Inter Milan best player of the year. Inter made it through to the semi-finals of the Champions League that year, and that was as far as Belözoğlu would reach with the club. He gradually became out of favour at Inter due to persistent injuries, and after making just nineteen appearances during the 2004–05 season, he became available for transfer.

===Newcastle United===

On 19 July 2005, Belözoğlu moved to Newcastle United on a five-year deal for a £3.8 million transfer fee. He made his debut on 3 August in a 2–1 home defeat to Deportivo La Coruña in the UEFA Intertoto Cup, and 11 days later started in Newcastle&#x27;s first game of the Premier League season, a defeat to Arsenal. In his fourth game on 23 October, he set up the opening goal with a corner to Shola Ameobi, and later scored the winner with a free kick, in a 3–2 victory over Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby. Of 25 games in all competitions in his first season, 20 in the league, he scored just one more goal: a long range shot on 5 November to defeat Birmingham City 1–0.

Injuries limited Belözoğlu to only 35 Premier League appearances in his subsequent two seasons at Newcastle, in which he scored three goals. On 17 January 2008, in an FA Cup replay against Stoke City, he was sent off after 29 minutes for retaliating after being fouled by John Eustace.

===Fenerbahçe===
In July 2008, Belözoğlu, was unveiled at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium, the traditional homeground of Fenerbahçe, in a signing ceremony. Fanatical Galatasaray supporters were enraged and started many &quot;anti-Belözoğlu&quot; campaigns for transferring to their rival. However, Belözoğlu stated that he had always been a Fenerbahçe fan, which has been confirmed by some of his past team-mates, including Galatasaray legends Hakan Şükür and Hasan Şaş. After a disappointing first season, consistent performances in the next saw Emre rewarded with the Süper Lig player of the year for the 2009–10 season. He was effective at both ends of the pitch, his experience and combative style proving a valuable asset in taking his team so close in both league and cup. On 3 November 2010, Belözoğlu declared that he hung posters of former Fenerbahçe players Aykut Kocaman, Rıdvan Dilmen and Džoni Novak on his walls at home.

===Atlético Madrid===
Belözoğlu moved to Atlético Madrid, the reigning champions of the Europa League on 29 May 2012. He signed a two-year contract and was warmly received by compatriot and midfield partner Arda Turan. On 7 July Belözoğlu trained with his new teammates before being unveiled by Atlético in a signing ceremony held in the Vicente Calderon stadium. He made his Atlético debut on 1 September 2012 in the UEFA Super Cup against Chelsea, coming on for the last three minutes in place of Radamel Falcao whose hat-trick contributed to Atletico&#x27;s 4–1 victory.

===Fenerbahçe (Second spell)===
Belözoğlu returned to Fenerbahçe on 31 January 2013 on a two-and-a-half-year contract worth €2 million per season. His first match was against Sivasspor.

===İstanbul Başakşehir===

Belözoğlu has signed an agreement with İstanbul Başakşehir for two years before the beginning of the 2015–2016 season. Ahead of the 2018–19 campaign, he announced that he would be retiring from football at the end of the season. However he decided not to retire without playing again at Fenerbahçe, his boyhood club.

===Fenerbahçe (Third spell)===
On 2 July 2019, he signed a one-year contract with Fenerbahçe. On 19 August 2019, he played his first match for Fenerbahçe after four seasons, wearing the captain’s armband against Gaziantep FK, and scored a goal from a penalty in the 24th minute of the match. On 7 July 2020, in the 31st week of the league, he scored a goal in the 81st minute against Gençlerbirliği, securing a 1–1 draw and earning Fenerbahçe 1 point. On 25 July 2020, he played the final match of his career in a 3–1 victory against Çaykur Rizespor. In the 39th minute of the match, he scored a goal from a penalty, bidding farewell to his career with a goal at Kadıköy. and he retired from football after this season.

==International career==
After making his international debut against Norway in 2000, Belözoğlu was a regular in the Turkey national team. Injury forced him out of the Euro 2000 but he was part of the Turkish squad that finished in third place at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Belözoğlu played the opening match of UEFA Euro 2008, but an injury sidelined him for the rest of the tournament as Turkey progressed to the semi-finals. On 7 September 2019, Belözoğlu played his 100th match against Andorra.

==Managerial career==
After his retirement, on 28 October 2020, Fenerbahçe announced that Belözoğlu was appointed director of football to Fenerbahçe&#x27;s first team. He led the summer transfer window of the 2020–21 season from August to October.

===Fenerbahçe (interim)===
On 25 March 2021, Fenerbahçe manager Erol Bulut left the team by mutual consent. Fenerbahçe board of directors and Belözoğlu agreed on an interim coaching position for 10 matchdays until the end of the season.

His first match as the club&#x27;s new manager took place eleven days later, when Fenerbahçe beat Denizlispor 1–0 in a Süper Lig match, which was his very first match in his managerial career. At the end of the season, Fenerbahçe finished in third place, by 2 points behind Beşiktaş. Belözoğlu finished with a record of 7 wins, 2 draws and 1 loss in 10 matches.

On 1 June 2021, Fenerbahçe president Ali Koç announced that Belözoğlu would no longer manage Fenerbahçe after the end of the interim period. On 2 June, Fenerbahçe officially confirmed his leaving by making a farewell announcement.

===İstanbul Başakşehir===
On 4 October 2021, Belözoğlu signed a two-year contract to manage İstanbul Başakşehir, returning to the team he had captained for four years. His first match as manager was a 3–2 home win over Beşiktaş on 15 October. He left the club on 6 September 2023.

===Ankaragücü===

On October 5, 2023, he signed a contract with Ankaragücü, one of the oldest clubs in Turkey and also the team of the capital of Turkey. He left the club at the end of the season.

==Style of play==
A versatile midfielder, Belözoğlu was capable of playing in the middle of the pitch as a central midfielder, as an advanced playmaker, or even on the left. He was mainly known for his technical ability, tactical sense and passing ability.

==Personal life==
Belözoğlu is a practising pious Muslim and has stated; &quot;like everyone else (who is Muslim), I&#x27;m trying to be as moderate as possible in this holy month. But the job I do is physically very hard, so on the day of a match and for one or two days previous I don&#x27;t fast&quot;.

He is fluent in Turkish, English, Italian and Spanish.

==Controversies==

=== Post-match brawl (2005) ===
After a post-match brawl in a 2006 World Cup qualification playoff match with Switzerland, Belözoğlu was banned for Turkey&#x27;s next six matches and fined CHF 15,000 (£6,622) plus costs of CHF 1,000 (£440) for his alleged part in the brawl. The FIFA Appeal Committee later reduced the ban to four matches.

=== Transfer to Newcastle United (2005) ===
Belözoğlu&#x27;s transfer from Inter Milan to Newcastle United in July 2005 is one of those about which the Stevens inquiry report in June 2007 expressed concerns.

=== Racial abuse accusations in England (2006) ===
Belözoğlu was accused of using racist insults towards Everton&#x27;s Joseph Yobo, Tim Howard and Joleon Lescott during a match on 30 December 2006. He denied these claims, and he was charged by The Football Association in January 2007 and found not guilty by an independent commission in March.

In February 2007, the FA announced another investigation into alleged racist remarks from Belözoğlu, this time aimed against Bolton Wanderers striker El-Hadji Diouf in a 2–1 win at St James&#x27; Park on 15 October 2006. Emre&#x27;s agent denied the accusation. Diouf subsequently decided not to press charges.

In March 2007, Belözoğlu faced a third racism allegation, from Watford defender Alhassan Bangura. He was cleared of any wrongdoing.

=== Racial abuse incident in Turkey (2012) ===
On 15 April 2012, Belözoğlu was accused of making a racist comment on the pitch towards Trabzonspor&#x27;s Didier Zokora. He has denied these claims. On 17 June 2014, Belözoğlu was sentenced to a two-and-a-half-month suspended prison sentence as a result of the claim, with the crime constituted as an insult crime. He is the first Turkish footballer to be sentenced for racism.

On 3 February 2020, Emre was accused of racism by John Obi Mikel, whom stated &quot;Emre swore at me and my family, I cannot accept this&quot;.

=== FETÖ investigation (2020) ===
According to Sait Aksoy, who is known as the &#x27;football imam&#x27; of FETÖ, Belözoğlu, who allegedly attended chats organised by the Gülen movement during his football career, was told by coach Fatih Terim: &quot;Stop your relationship with Fethullahists. They will end your career and darken your future. I will never and absolutely not allow such an organisation in my team.&quot; Later, Emre distanced himself from the Gülenists, thinking that the movement only &quot;served for money purposes&quot;.

In 2020, Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office started an investigation upon a report that Belözoğlu was a FETÖ member. However, later on, a decision of non-prosecution was issued on the grounds that attending a chat and giving money was not sufficient evidence for membership of the organisation.

<doc id="616618" wikidata="Q461486" url="?curid=616618" title="Heterochromia iridum">
<text>Heterochromia is a variation in coloration most often used to describe color differences of the iris, but can also be applied to color variation of hair or skin. Heterochromia is determined by the production, delivery, and concentration of melanin (a pigment). It may be inherited, or caused by genetic mosaicism, chimerism, disease, or injury. It occurs in humans and certain breeds of domesticated animals.

Heterochromia of the eye is called heterochromia iridum or heterochromia iridis. It can be complete, sectoral, or central. In complete heterochromia, one iris is a different color from the other. In sectoral heterochromia, part of one iris is a different color from its remainder. In central heterochromia, there is a ring around the pupil or possibly spikes of different colors radiating from the pupil.

Though multiple causes have been posited, the scientific consensus is that a lack of genetic diversity is the primary reason behind heterochromia, at least in domestic animals. This is due to a mutation of the genes that determine melanin distribution at the 8-HTP pathway, which usually only become corrupted due to chromosomal homogeneity. Though common in some breeds of cats, dogs, cattle and horses due to inbreeding, heterochromia is uncommon in humans, affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States, and is not associated with lack of genetic diversity.

The affected eye may be hyperpigmented (hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (hypochromic). In humans, an increase of melanin production in the eyes indicates hyperplasia of the iris tissues, whereas a lack of melanin indicates hypoplasia.

The term is derived from Ancient Greek: , &quot;different&quot; and , &quot;color&quot;.
==Background==

Eye color, specifically the color of the irises, is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin. Although the processes determining eye color are not fully understood, it is known that inherited eye color is determined by multiple genes. Environmental or acquired factors can alter these inherited traits.

The color of the mammalian, including human, iris is very variable. However, there are only two pigments present, eumelanin and pheomelanin. The overall concentration of these pigments, the ratio between them, variation in the distribution of pigment in the layers of the stroma of the iris and the effects of light scattering all play a part in determining eye color. In the United States, July 12 is observed by some as National Different Colored Eyes Day.

==Classification==
Heterochromia is classified primarily by onset: as either genetic or acquired. Although a distinction is frequently made between heterochromia that affects an eye completely or only partially (sectoral heterochromia), it is often classified as either genetic (due to mosaicism or congenital) or acquired, with mention as to whether the affected iris or portion of the iris is darker or lighter. Most cases of heterochromia are hereditary, or caused by genetic factors such as chimerism, and are entirely benign and unconnected to any pathology, but some are associated with certain diseases and syndromes. Sometimes one eye may change color following disease or injury.

===Genetic===
====Abnormal iris darker====
*Lisch nodules – iris hamartomas seen in neurofibromatosis.
*Ocular melanosis – a condition characterized by increased pigmentation of the uveal tract, episclera, and anterior chamber angle.
*Oculodermal melanocytosis (nevus of Ota)
*Pigment dispersion syndrome – a condition characterized by loss of pigmentation from the posterior iris surface which is disseminated intraocularly and deposited on various intraocular structures, including the anterior surface of the iris.
*Sturge–Weber syndrome – a syndrome characterized by a port-wine stain nevus in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve, ipsilateral leptomeningeal angiomas with intracranial calcification and neurologic signs, and angioma of the choroid, often with secondary glaucoma.

====Abnormal iris lighter====
*Simple heterochromia – a rare condition characterized by the absence of other ocular or systemic problems. The lighter eye is typically regarded as the affected eye as it usually shows iris hypoplasia. It may affect an iris completely or only partially.
*Congenital Horner&#x27;s syndrome – sometimes inherited, although usually acquired.
*Waardenburg syndrome – a syndrome in which heterochromia is expressed as a bilateral iris hypochromia in some cases. A Japanese review of 11 children with albinism found that the condition was present. All had sectoral/partial heterochromia.
*Piebaldism – similar to Waardenburg&#x27;s syndrome, a rare disorder of melanocyte development characterized by a white forelock and multiple symmetrical hypopigmented or depigmented macules.
*Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease – a bowel disorder associated with heterochromia in the form of a sector hypochromia. The affected sectors have been shown to have reduced numbers of melanocytes and decreased stromal pigmentation.
*Incontinentia pigmenti
*Parry–Romberg syndrome

===Acquired===
Acquired heterochromia is usually due to injury, inflammation, the use of certain eyedrops that damage the iris, or tumors, both benign and malignant.

====Abnormal iris darker====
*Deposition of material
**Siderosis – iron deposition within ocular tissues due to a penetrating injury and a retained iron-containing, intraocular foreign body.
**Hemosiderosis – long standing hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber) following blunt trauma to the eye may lead to iron deposition from blood products.
*Certain eyedrops – prostaglandin analogues (latanoprost, isopropyl unoprostone, travoprost, and bimatoprost) are used topically to lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients. A concentric heterochromia has developed in some patients applying these drugs. A stimulation of melanin synthesis within iris melanocytes has been postulated.
*Neoplasm – Nevi and melanomatous tumors.
*Iridocorneal endothelium syndrome
*Iris ectropion syndrome

====Abnormal iris lighter====
*Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis – a condition characterized by a low grade, asymptomatic uveitis in which the iris in the affected eye becomes hypochromic and has a washed-out, somewhat moth eaten appearance. The heterochromia can be very subtle, especially in patients with lighter colored irides. It is often most easily seen in daylight. The prevalence of heterochromia associated with Fuchs has been estimated in various studies with results suggesting that there is more difficulty recognizing iris color changes in dark-eyed individuals.
*Acquired Horner&#x27;s syndrome – usually acquired, as in neuroblastoma, although sometimes inherited.
*Neoplasm – Melanomas can also be very lightly pigmented, and a lighter colored iris may be a rare manifestation of metastatic disease to the eye.
*Parry–Romberg syndrome – due to tissue loss.
Heterochromia has also been observed in those with Duane syndrome.
*Chronic iritis
*Juvenile xanthogranuloma
*Leukemia and lymphoma

===Partial heterochromia – different colors in the same iris===
Partial heterochromia is most often a benign trait of genetic origins, but, like complete heterochromia, can be acquired or be related to clinical syndromes.
====Sectoral====
In sectoral heterochromia, areas of the same iris contain two different colors, the contrasting colors being demarcated in a radial, or sectoral, manner. Sectoral heterochromia may affect one or both eyes.
It is unknown how rare sectoral heterochromia is in humans, but it is considered to be less common than complete heterochromia.

====Central====

Central heterochromia is also an eye condition where there are two colors in the same iris; but the arrangement is concentric, rather than sectoral. The central (pupillary) zone of the iris is a different color than the mid-peripheral (ciliary) zone. Central heterochromia is more noticeable in irises containing low amounts of melanin.

==In history and culture==
Heterochromia of the eye was first described as a human condition by Aristotle, who termed it &quot;heteroglaucos&quot;.

Notable historical figures thought to have heterochromia include the Byzantine emperor Anastasius the First, dubbed &quot;dikoros&quot; (Greek for &#x27;having two pupils&#x27;). &quot;His right eye was light blue, while the left was black, nevertheless his eyes were most attractive&quot;, is the description of the historian John Malalas. A more recent example is the German poet, playwright, novelist, scientist, statesman, theatre director, and critic, Johann Wolfgang Goethe.

The &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;, an early literary treatment of the life of Alexander the Great, attributes heterochromia to him. In it he is described as having one eye light and one eye dark. However, no ancient historical source mentions this. It is used to emphasise the otherworldly and heroic qualities of Alexander.

In the Ars Amatoria, the Roman poet Ovid describes the witch Dipsas as having &#x27;double pupils&#x27;. Kirby Flower Smith suggested that this could be understood as heterochromia, though other scholars have disagreed. The Roman jurist and writer Cicero also mentions the same feature of &#x27;double pupils&#x27; as being found in some Italic women. Pliny the Elder related this feature to the concept of &#x27;the evil eye&#x27;.

The twelfth-century scholar Eustathius, in his commentary on the Iliad, reports a tradition in which the Thracian Thamyris (son of the nymph Argiope), who was famed for his musical abilities, had one eye that was grey, whilst the other was black. W. B. McDaniel suggests that this should be interpreted as heterochromia.

==In other animals==
Although infrequently seen in humans, complete heterochromia is more frequently observed in species of domesticated mammals. The blue eye occurs within a white spot, where melanin is absent from the skin and hair (see Leucism). These species include the cat, particularly breeds such as Turkish Van, Khao Manee and (rarely) Japanese Bobtail. These so-called odd-eyed cats are white, or mostly white, with one normal eye (copper, orange, yellow, green), and one blue eye. Among dogs, complete heterochromia is seen often in the Siberian Husky and few other breeds, usually Australian Shepherd and Catahoula Leopard Dog and rarely in Shih Tzu. Horses with complete heterochromia have one brown and one white, gray, or blue eye—complete heterochromia is more common in horses with pinto coloring. Complete heterochromia occurs also in cattle and even water buffalo. It can also be seen in ferrets with Waardenburg syndrome, although it can be very hard to tell at times as the eye color is often a midnight blue.

Sectoral heterochromia, usually sectoral hypochromia, is often seen in dogs, specifically in breeds with merle coats. These breeds include the Australian Shepherd, Border Collie, Collie, Shetland Sheepdog, Welsh Corgi, Pyrenean Shepherd, Mudi, Beauceron, Catahoula Cur, Dunker, Great Dane, Dachshund and Chihuahua. It also occurs in certain breeds that do not carry the merle trait, such as the Siberian Husky, Dalmatian, and rarely, Shih Tzu. There are examples of cat breeds that have the condition such as Van cat.

<text>Fingal ( ; ) is a county in Ireland. It is in the province of Leinster and is part of the Eastern and Midland Region. It is one of three successor counties to County Dublin, which was disestablished for administrative purposes in 1994. Its name is derived from the medieval territory of Scandinavian foreigners () that settled in the area. Fingal County Council is the local authority for the county. In 2022 the population of the county was 330,506, making it the second most populated council in Dublin and the third most populous county in the state.

==Geography and subdivisions==
Fingal is one of three counties into which County Dublin was divided in 1994. Swords is the county town. The other large urban centre is Blanchardstown. Smaller towns include Balbriggan and Malahide. Suburban villages with extensive housing include Baldoyle, Castleknock, Howth (and Sutton), Lusk, Donabate,Portmarnock, Skerries. Small rural settlements exist in the northern and western parts of the county. The motto of the arms of Fingal reads meaning &quot;Abundance of Land and Sea&quot;. The motto reflects the strong farming and fishing ties historically associated with the area. It also features a Viking longboat, which represents the arrival of the Norse in Fingal, where they became integrated with the existing Irish.
Fingal is bordered by County Meath to the north, by Kildare to the west and by Dublin city to the south. At the Strawberry Beds, the River Liffey separates the county from South Dublin.

=== Towns and villages ===
Fingal varies enormously in character, from densely populated suburban areas of the contiguous Dublin metropolitan region to remote rural villages and small, unpopulated agricultural townlands.

The northernmost parts of Ballymun, Santry and Finglas are also part of Fingal. Clonee, part of County Meath, has housing estates in its hinterland that merge into the estates of Ongar in western Fingal.

===Baronies and civil parishes===

The former county of Dublin was divided into nine baronies. The part of Fingal within County Dublin was in later centuries subdivided into the following administrative baronies: Balrothery West, Balrothery East, Nethercross, Castleknock and Coolock. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. The last boundary change of a barony in Dublin was in 1842, when the barony of Balrothery was divided into Balrothery East and Balrothery West. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under &quot;Administrative units&quot;. The boundaries of Fingal do not respect the boundaries of the baronies. As a result, only three baronies are entirely contained in the county: Balrothery East, Balrothery West, and Nethercross. Parts of three baronies are also contained in the county: Castleknock, Coolock, and Newcastle.

In the case of Castleknock, most civil parishes of the barony are under the jurisdiction of Fingal County Council. Some of the eastern parishes are under the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council. The core of the civil parish of Finglas lies within Dublin City. There are two substantial exclaves of the parish proper that are located in Fingal.

In the case of Coolock, most civil parishes of the barony are in Dublin City. The parishes listed in the table below are located in Fingal.

In the case of Newcastle, most of the barony is situated south of the River Liffey and so is under the jurisdiction of South Dublin County Council. Six townlands are located north of the Liffey in the civil parish of Leixlip. Listed in the table below, they are part of Fingal.

== History ==

=== Terminology and etymology ===
The name &quot;Fingal&quot; derives from the medieval territory of &quot;Fine Gall&quot; (tribe or territory of foreigners), the Viking settlement north of Dublin. The Vikings referred to the hinterland of Dublin as .

In Ireland, the usage of the word &quot;county&quot; nearly always comes before rather than after the county name; thus &quot;&quot;County&quot; Clare&quot; in Ireland as opposed to &quot;Clare &quot;County&quot;&quot; in Michigan, US. In the case of those counties created after 1994, they often drop the word &quot;county&quot; entirely, or use it after the name; internet search engines show many more uses (on Irish sites) of &quot;Fingal&quot; than of either &quot;County Fingal&quot; or &quot;Fingal County&quot;. The local authority uses all three forms.

Fingallian is an extinct language, a hybrid of Old and Middle English and Old Norse, with Leinster Irish influences. It was spoken by the people of Fingal until the mid-19th century.

Fingal is within the part of the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly, established in 2015, one of three such regional assemblies in the state. Within that, it is part of the Dublin strategic planning area.

=== Early Gaelic history ===
In the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy identified Eblana (Dublin) as the capital of a people called the Eblani. In later centuries the territory north of the river Liffey was known as Mide or Midhe, i.e. &quot;the Kingdom of Meath&quot; (that to the south was known as &quot;Coigh Cuolan&quot; or &quot;Cualan&quot;). The west of this area was known as Teffia, and the east as Bregia (Latinised from Gaelic Magh Breagh, &quot;the great plain of Meath&quot;). Bregia comprised five Gaelic triocha-cheds (equivalent to cantreds) or the later baronies, and was ruled by the king at Tara. These princes, and various Gaelic chieftains, held sway over the area until the coming of the Vikings in the 8th century.

=== Vikings and Hiberno-Norse ===
By 841 AD a Scandinavian settlement had been established at Dublin; this was abandoned in 902, re-established in 917, and developed thereafter. It was so established by the 11th century that it was regarded even amongst the surrounding native Gaelic population as a minor kingdom ruled by Hiberno-Norse kings. The Norse Kingdom of Dublin stretched, at its greatest, from Drogheda to Arklow, and while mostly a thin strip of coastal land, from the Irish Sea westwards as far as Leixlip in the central part.

After the Battle of Clontarf, when High King Brian Boru curtailed the power of the Vikings in Ireland, the Norse-Irish Kingdom of Dublin continued, with its own bishop, part of the Westminster hierarchy rather than the Irish, though it gradually came under the influence of the Kings of Leinster. Diarmait Mac Murchada established himself there before his expulsion by the High King in 1166, a series of events that led to the area being invaded in the late 12th century, by the Cambro-Normans. This was to form part of the heartland of the area known as The Pale during the successive periods of rule by Anglo-Norman and the later kings of England.

=== After the Anglo-Norman invasion ===
==== Early Anglo-Norman grants ====
With the arrival of the Anglo/Cambro-Normans in 1169, the territory of the old Gaelic Kingdom of Meath was promised in around 1172 to Hugh de Lacy by King Henry II of England. At that time, Meath extended to most of the current county of Fingal (including as far as Clontarf, Santry and the barony of Castleknock), County Westmeath and part of County Kildare. Fingal was therefore implicitly included in the grant of &quot;Meath&quot; either as part of Meath proper or under the additional element of that grant &quot;and for increase to the gift, all fees which he has or shall acquire about Dublin&quot;. This element of the grant related to his role as Bailiff and was copied into the Gormanston Register.

Strongbow was probably also assigned some fees within the royal demesne of Dublin, as in the case of Hugh de Lacy&#x27;s custodianship of Dublin, in payment of his services. This appears evidenced by several grants which he made in his own name within the city to St. Mary&#x27;s Abbey, and his foundation of a hospital of St. John of Jerusalem at Kilmainham. Therefore, both Strongbow and Hugh de Lacy exercised lordships within the royal demesne of Dublin.

In addition to Dublin city, the royal demesne itself also consisted of the royal manors of Crumlin, Esker, Newcastle, and Saggart, in the south-west of the county, and the royal demesnes of O Thee (O&#x27;Teig), O Brun (O&#x27;Broin), and O Kelly (O&#x27;Ceallaigh) in the south-east of the county, which were rented from the Crown by Irish-speaking tenants. Over half of the land in the county of Dublin was granted to religious houses and priories, as well as archbishops and monasteries, and minor lay lords. In such a way too, an estate was given to the Irish chieftain MacGillamocholmog, who held sway over the territory of Cualann (Wicklow) when the Anglo-Normans arrived.

De Lacy parcelled out most of this land to his vassals, who were to hold these lands from him, as he had held the Lordship of Meath from King Henry, by military tenure. D&#x27;Alton also provides a reference to the enumeration of these grants given in Hibernica, by Harris (pp. 42–43). Hugh de Lacy was appointed Viceroy in 1178, and again in 1181 after a brief period of royal disfavour.

By virtue of his grant of Meath, Hugh de Lacy was appointed a Palatine Count in that territory and divided it amongst his various vassals who were commonly called &quot;De Lacy&#x27;s Barons&quot;. These were: Hugh Tyrell, Baron of Castleknock; Jocelyn de Angulo, Baron of Navan and Ardbraccan; De Misset, Baron of Lune; Adam de Feypo, Baron Skryne; Fitz-Thomas, Baron of Kells; Hussey, Baron of Galtrim; Richard de Fleming, Baron Slane; Adam Dullard or Dollard, of Dullenvarty; Gilbert de Nugent, Baron Delvin and later Earl of Westmeath;Risteárd de Tiúit, Baron of Moyashell; Robert de Lacy&#x27;s descendants, Barons of Rathwire; De Constantine, Baron of Kilbixey Petit, Baron of Mullingar; Meyler FitzHenry of Maghernan, Rathkenin, and Ardnocker. As Burke points out, to some of these there descended the De Genevilles, Lords of Meath; Mortimer, Earl of March (and later Lord of Trim, from De Geneville); the Plunkets, of Danish descent, Baron of Dunsany and of Killeen, and later Earl of Louth and Earl of Fingall (by letters patent); the Prestons, Viscounts Gormanston and Viscount Tara, the Barnewalls, Baron Trimlestown and Viscount Barnewall; the Nettervilles, Barons of Dowth; the Bellews, Barons of Duleek; the Darcys of Platten, Barons of Navan; the Cusacks, Barons of Culmullin; the FitzEustaces, Baron Portlester. Some of these again were succeeded by the De Baths of Athcarn, the Dowdalls of Athlumny, the Cruises, the Drakes of Drake Rath, and others.

==== John of England ====
In 1184, Prince John, the Lord of Ireland and Earl of Mortain gave half the tithes of Fingal to the episcopal see of Dublin, which grant was confirmed in 1337 by King Edward, and in 1395 by King Richard II when in Dublin.

John featured prominently in the tales of Robin Hood during the reign of Richard I of England, absent on the Third Crusade. In 1189, on the breaking up of Robin Hood&#x27;s company, Robin Hood&#x27;s companion Little John, is said to have exhibited his feats of archery on Oxmanstown Green in Dublin, until having been detected in a robbery, he was hanged on Arbour Hill nearby. Another Robin Hood–type, known as McIerlagh Gedy, is recorded as a notorious felon responsible for many thefts and incendiary acts in Meath, Leinster, and Fingal, and was taken prisoner, brought to Trim Castle and hanged.

Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath, son of Hugh, gained seisin of the Lordship of Meath by charter in 1194 during Richard I&#x27;s exercise of the Lordship of Ireland, having previously been a minor when his father Hugh de Lacy died in 1186. Walter succeeded to all Hugh&#x27;s lordships, including of Fingal, which by a grant of King John in 1208 was subsequently confirmed in perpetuity under the same terms as the palatine Lordship of Meath, and no longer limited by the original conditions linked to service as bailiff of Dublin.

=== Feudal administration ===

==== Prescriptive Barony, 1208 ====
In 1208 the Lordship of Fingal was granted to Walter de Lacy by King John of England.

The first known administrative provision related to the original name was a palatine grant of the Paramount &quot;Lordship of Fingal&quot;, confirmed by letters patent from King John. This feudal barony or Prescriptive barony was granted to Walter de Lacy and his heirs in perpetuity in 1208. The grant was based on Hugh de Lacy, Walter&#x27;s father, having held the same on a basis of grand serjeanty for his services as bailiff to the King. The grant describes the scope of administrative responsibility, and the limits of powers delegated. The gist of the grant is recounted as follows:

==== County Dublin ====
In the 1208 grant, the bulk of Fingal, considered to be &quot;in the vale of Dublin&quot;, was part of the County Dublin, when the latter was established as one of the first twelve counties created by King John during his visit to Ireland in 1210. Its history forms part of that of County Dublin for the following eight centuries.

==== Other derivative or related grants and titles ====
As mentioned above, by the time John granted Fingal as part of his inheritance to Walter, Walter&#x27;s father Hugh had already sub-infeudated parts thereof to his vassals (e.g. the Castleknock barony, granted by Hugh de Lacy to Hugh Tyrell, etc.). Therefore, Fingal was already a superior lordship (or paramount barony) when originally granted, consisting of lesser baronies (and their several manors), even though some of these may have been granted by Hugh in his capacities as Bailiff or as Viceroy, and later confirmed as held of the Crown &quot;in capite&quot;, and in perpetuity. The Lordship of Fingal was, therefore, a paramount superiority over several sub-infeudated smaller baronies (such as Castleknock, Santry, Balrothery), and thus eventually accrued vicecomital attributes.

In addition, several other baronies existed as feudal holdings or were created within the geographical territory of Fingal (such as Finglas; Swerdes Swords; Santry, Feltrim), and in other parts of Dublin: Howth and Senkylle (Shankill in southern Dublin).

A later, related, development was the granting of the first viscountcy in Ireland in 1478 to a Preston, Lord Gormanston, the Premier Viscount of Ireland, who at the time was a major landowner in the Fingal area, and a direct descendant of Walter de Lacy. That viscountcy was called after Gormanston as the latter was the principal seat and Manor of the Prestons at the time, having been acquired upon their relinquishment of occupancy of the Manor of Fyngallestoun. The Viscounts Gormanston continued to retain the Lordship of the latter under reversion., and the prescriptive barony of Fingal was also retained by the Viscount Gormanston as an incorporeal hereditament &quot;in gross&quot;, until passed to the late Patrick Denis O&#x27;Donnell, and thence to his son, gazetted in England as Lord O&#x27;Donnell of Fingal.

==== Medieval taxation, and the Pale ====
Geographically, Fingal became a core area of the Pale, and that part of Ireland was most intensively settled by the Normans and in due course the English. Records during the period 1285–92, of rolls of receipts for taxes to the King, indicate Fingal as a distinct area, listed along with the baronies or lordships of Duleek, Kells, and Loxuedy, as well as Valley (Liffey), and sometimes under, sometimes separate from Dublin. Later records of rolls of receipts e.g. &quot;granted to the King in Ireland of the term of Trinity a.r.21 (1293)&quot; for the period 1293–1301 also include references to Fingal listed as a lordship, again along with the baronies of Duleek and Kells, and Dublin City, and Valley, all listed under Dublin County. Several other references also exist in the chancery records of the 14th century.

==== Abolition of feudal system ====
The feudal system was finally completely abolished by the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009. The Act abolished feudal tenure, but preserved estates in land, including customary rights and incorporeal hereditaments.

==== Earldom of Fingall ====
A title in the peerage of Ireland of Earl of Fingall was created in 1628 by Charles I, and granted to Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall, Baron Killeen, whose first wife, Elizabeth Plunkett &quot;née&quot; FitzGerald, thus became Lady Killeen The Plunketts also intermarried with the Prestons, Viscounts Gormanston. The Fingall Estate Papers, acquired by the Fingal County Archives, do not however relate to any properties in Fingal, but rather to lands in Meath. That Fingall title became extinct upon the death of the 12th and last Earl in 1984, along with a peerage barony of the same name, not to be confused with the titular prescriptive barony of Fingal previously mentioned.

===Modern county===
In 1985, County Dublin was divided into three electoral counties: Dublin–Belgard to the southwest, Dublin–Fingal to the north, and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown to the southeast. At the 1991 local election, the area of Dublin–Fingal was renamed as Fingal.

On 1 January 1994, under the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993, the old County Dublin ceased to exist and was succeeded by three counties:
* Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown
* Fingal
* South Dublin

Under the Local Government Act 2001, Fingal is determined and listed as a county. The Placenames Committee maintains the Placenames Database of Ireland, which records all placenames, past and present. The former county of Dublin is listed in the database along with the subdivisions of that county; Fingal, with its subdivisions, is also listed.

==Governance and politics==
Fingal County Council is the local authority for the county, established on 1 January 1994 by the same law that created the county. It succeeded the functions of Dublin County Council in the former electoral county of Fingal, which was abolished by the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993. It is one of four councils in the traditional County Dublin. The County Hall is in Swords, with another major office in Blanchardstown. The county administration is headed by a Chief Executive, leading a team of functional heads and directors of services. The county council is governed by the Local Government Act 2001. The council has 40 elected members who are elected by single transferable vote in elections held every 5 years.

Fingal County Council sends three representatives to the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly.

For elections to Dáil Éireann, the following Dáil constituencies are wholly contained within the county: Dublin Fingal (5 seats); Dublin West (4 seats). Parts of the following constituencies are also contained in the county: Malahide and Howth in Dublin Bay North (5 seats); and small parts of Mulhuddart in Dublin North-West (3 seats).

== Economy ==

Fingal is Ireland&#x27;s primary horticultural region, producing 50% of the national vegetable output and 75% of all glasshouse crops grown in the country. However, the areas of production are coming under severe pressure from other development and the rural towns are increasingly becoming dormitories for the city. Howth Harbour is the biggest fishing harbour on the east coast and the fifth largest in the country.

Dublin Airport is located within the county, along with the headquarters of Aer Lingus and Ryanair. The Dublin Airport Authority has its head office on the grounds of the airport. In addition Swords has the headquarters of ASL Airlines, CityJet, and Ingersoll Rand.

In 2006 Fingal County Council was lauded by prominent Irish construction industry figures, politicians and EU Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs for becoming the first local authority in Ireland to introduce mandatory sustainable building requirements. The policy, which relates to all construction in 8 parts of the county—including roughly 13,000 new homes—stipulates that the amount of energy and emissions associated with the heating and hot water of all buildings must be reduced by at least 60% compared to Irish Building Regulations, with at least 30% of the energy used for heating and hot water coming from renewable sources such as solar, geothermal or biomass.

==Demographics==

== Education ==
The Technological University Dublin formerly known as the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown is the largest third-level education facility in Fingal.

== Sport ==
Fingal is home to Morton Stadium, Ireland&#x27;s national athletics stadium and 2003 Special Olympics venue.

Between 2007 and 2011 Morton Stadium hosted the home matches of the former soccer team Sporting Fingal F.C.

The county has many GAA teams which are still organised under the County Dublin GAA since the political county changes have not affected the GAA Counties (see Gaelic Athletic Association county). However, a team representing Fingal as county has competed against GAA counties as a sub-region of the GAA county of Dublin in the Kehoe Cup, Division 2B (as of 2014) of the Allianz National Hurling League and (in the past) the Nicky Rackard Cup.

<text>Andriy Mykolayovych Shevchenko (, ; born 29 September 1976) is a Ukrainian former professional football player and manager. Shevchenko played as a striker for Dynamo Kyiv, AC Milan, Chelsea and the Ukraine national team. He was most recently head coach of Serie A club Genoa. Shevchenko is considered one of the greatest strikers of all time and Ukraine&#x27;s greatest ever player. He is the all-time top scorer for the Ukraine national team with 48 goals.

Shevchenko began his career at Dynamo Kyiv and won five league titles in a row before signing for Milan. In Milan, he established himself as one of the top strikers in Europe and won the UEFA Champions League in 2003. He also won various league and cup titles in Ukraine, Italy and England. He was also a Champions League runner-up in 2005 and 2008. He was named in the FIFA World XI for 2005. In 2004, he was named as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration, and in the same year he also received the Ballon d&#x27;Or. In his international career, he led Ukraine as captain to the quarter-finals in their first ever FIFA World Cup appearance in 2006, and also took part at UEFA Euro 2012 on home soil.

Shevchenko is ranked as the seventh top goalscorer in all UEFA club competitions with 67 goals. With a tally of 175 goals scored for Milan, he is the second most prolific player in the history of the club, and is also the all-time top scorer of the &quot;Derby della Madonnina&quot; (the derby between Milan and their local rivals Inter Milan) with 14 goals.

Quitting football for politics in 2012, he stood for election to the Ukrainian Parliament in the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election, but his party failed to win parliamentary representation. He returned to football in 2016, as assistant coach of the Ukraine national team February to July, at the time led by Mykhaylo Fomenko. In July 2016, Shevchenko was appointed Ukraine&#x27;s head coach, and led the nation to the quarter-finals at UEFA Euro 2020. Shevchenko became the Vice President of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine on 17 November 2022. He left the National Olympic Committee in January 2023 due to disagreement with the results of the election of its new President Vadym Gutzeit. In January 2024, Shevchenko was elected President of the Ukrainian Football Association.

==Early life==
Shevchenko was born in Dvirkivshchyna, Ukrainian SSR, in 1976, into the family of &quot;Praporshchik&quot; Mykola Hryhorovych Shevchenko. In 1979, his family moved to the newly built neighbourhood in Kyiv – Obolon (Minsk District was created in 1975). In Kyiv, Shevchenko went to the 216th City School and in 1986 (aged 9) enrolled into the football section coached by Oleksandr Shpakov. Because of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, together with his sport group he was evacuated temporarily from the city. At an early age, he also was a competitive boxer in the LLWI Ukrainian junior league, but eventually he elected to move on to football.

==Club career==
===Dynamo Kyiv===
In 1986, Shevchenko failed a dribbling test for entrance to a specialist sports school in Kyiv, but happened to catch the eye of a Dynamo Kyiv scout while playing in a youth tournament, and was thus brought to the club. Four years later, Shevchenko was in the Dynamo under-14 team for the Ian Rush Cup (now the Welsh Super Cup); he finished as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer and was awarded a pair of Rush&#x27;s boots as a prize by the then-Liverpool player.

Shevchenko started out his professional career at age 16 when he came on for only 12 minutes as a substitute in a 0–2 home loss to the Odesa second team Chornomorets-2 Odesa on 5 May 1993. He was a substitute for the last six home games of the 1992–93 Ukrainian First League and did not score any goals. The next 1993–94 season in the second tier, Shevchenko was the top goalscorer for Dynamo-2 with 12 goals, and he made his first appearance in the starting XI. Shevchenko scored his first goal against Krystal Chortkiv in a 1–1 home draw on 7 October 1993. During the same season, he recorded his first hat-trick in a home game against Artania Ochakiv on 21 November 1993 which Dynamo-2 won 4–1. Shevchenko stayed with Dynamo-2 until the end of 1994 and was once again called up for one game in late 1996.

He made his Vyshcha Liha debut for Dynamo Kiev on 8 November 1994 in an away game against Shakhtar Donetsk when he was 18. It was actually his second game for the senior squad overall after he had played a home game of the National Cup on 5 November 1994 against Skala Stryi. That year Shevchenko became a national champion and a cup holder with Dynamo. He won his second league title the next season, scoring 6 goals in 20 matches. He scored a hat-trick in the first half of a 1997–98 UEFA Champions League away match against Barcelona, which Dynamo won 4–0; no other visitor to the Camp Nou scored a Champions League treble until 2021. His 19 goals in 23 league matches and six goals in ten Champions League matches (including a hat-trick over two legs against Real Madrid) were followed by a total of 28 goals in all competitions in the 1998–99 season. He won the domestic league title with Dynamo in each of his five seasons with the club.

===AC Milan===
In 1999, Shevchenko joined Italian club Milan for a then-record transfer fee of $25 million. He made his league debut on 28 August 1999 in a 2–2 draw with Lecce. Alongside five other players – Michel Platini, John Charles, Gunnar Nordahl, István Nyers, and Ferenc Hirzer – he managed, as a foreign player, to win the Serie A best goalscorer award in his debut season, finishing with 24 goals in 32 matches. Shevchenko maintained his excellent form into the 2000–01 season, scoring 24 goals in 34 matches, including nine goals in 14 Champions League games. During the same season, he also reunited with Kakha Kaladze as teammates when Milan signed the Georgian defender from Dynamo Kyiv in January 2001.

Despite netting only five times in 24 matches, mainly due to injuries, Shevchenko became the first Ukrainian-born player to win the Champions League after Milan lifted their sixth trophy in 2002–03. He scored the crucial away goal against rivals Inter Milan in the semi-final, and then scored the winning penalty in the shoot out against Juventus in the final, which had ended goalless after extra time. Following Milan winning the Champions League, Shevchenko flew to Kyiv to put his medal by the grave of Valeriy Lobanovskyi (who he was managed by when he was at Dynamo), who died in 2002. He also scored the winning goal in the 2003 UEFA Super Cup victory over Porto. Shevchenko finished top goalscorer in Serie A in 2003–04 for the second time in his career, scoring 24 goals in 32 matches as Milan won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; for the first time in five years, leading to Milan&#x27;s second trophy of the season. In August 2004, he scored three goals against Lazio as Milan won the Supercoppa Italiana. Shevchenko capped off the year by being awarded the 2004 Ballon d&#x27;Or, becoming the third Ukrainian player ever to win the award after Oleg Blokhin and Igor Belanov. In the same year, Shevchenko was also inducted into the FIFA 100.

He scored 17 goals in the 2004–05 season after missing several games with a fractured cheekbone. Shevchenko made Champions League history the following season; on 23 November 2005, he scored all four goals in Milan&#x27;s 4–0 group stage drubbing of Fenerbahçe, becoming only the fifth player to accomplish this feat; his company includes Marco van Basten, Simone Inzaghi, Dado Pršo and Ruud van Nistelrooy (while Lionel Messi joined that group in the 2009–10 season and Robert Lewandowski in 2012–13 and 2019–20), and Shevchenko was the only player to have done it in an away game until Olivier Giroud did so for Chelsea, away to Sevilla, in the 2020–21 season. Milan eventually lost the tournament when Shevchenko missed the deciding penalty in the final shoot-out against Liverpool. In the 2005–06 Champions League, he scored his last Milan goal in the second leg of the quarter-final as they eliminated Lyon after a last-minute comeback in a 3–1 victory. In the semi-final, Milan lost to eventual winners Barcelona 1–0, a match where Shevchenko controversially had a last minute equaliser denied by the referee. Despite this, he still ended up being the top scorer of the whole competition with 9 goals in 12 games.

On 8 February 2006, Shevchenko became Milan&#x27;s second highest all-time goalscorer, behind Gunnar Nordahl, after netting against Treviso. He finished the season as joint fourth-top scorer with 19 goals in 28 games. Shevchenko ended his seven-year stint with Milan with 175 goals in 296 games.

===Chelsea===
During the summer of 2005, there were persistent reports that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich offered a record sum €73 million and striker Hernán Crespo to Milan in exchange for Shevchenko. Milan refused the monetary offer but took Crespo on loan. Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon was quoted as saying, &quot;I think Shevchenko is the type of player we would like. At the end of the day to improve what we have got, it has to be a great player and Shevchenko certainly comes into that class.&quot; Shevchenko cited that the persistence of Abramovich was a key factor in his move. Milan, desperate to keep the striker, offered Shevchenko a six-year contract extension.

On 28 May 2006, Shevchenko left Milan for Chelsea for £30.8 million (€43.875 million), topping Michael Essien&#x27;s transfer fee from the previous year and also breaking the record for a player signed by an English club. He received the number seven shirt, as Chelsea manager José Mourinho said that Shevchenko could continue wearing it.

Shevchenko made his debut for Chelsea on 13 August 2006 in the FA Community Shield, scoring his side&#x27;s goal in a 2–1 loss to Liverpool. On 23 August, he scored his first Premier League goal – and his 300th in top-flight and international football – in a 2–1 loss to Middlesbrough. He scored goals sporadically throughout the season, including equalisers against Porto and Valencia in the 2006–07 Champions League and another against London rival club Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup to help take his side into the semi-final. He finished with a total of 14 from 51 games. During the campaign, he netted his 57th career goal in European competitions, leaving him second behind Gerd Müller on the all-time European goalscorers list, before Filippo Inzaghi made the record his own in the 2007–08 Champions League. Shevchenko&#x27;s 2006–07 season was cut short due to injury and a hernia operation. He missed the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool and the FA Cup final against Manchester United at the new Wembley Stadium on 19 May 2007. He did, however, start for Chelsea in the 2007 League Cup final victory over Arsenal in which he hit the bar which would have given Chelsea a 3–1 lead.{}

Shevchenko was handed his first start of the 2007–08 season against Blackburn Rovers at home to cover for the injured Didier Drogba, but the game finished goalless. His first goal of the season came three days later, equalising for Chelsea in a match against Rosenborg, which turned out to be José Mourinho&#x27;s last game as manager of Chelsea. Throughout the season, Shevchenko was in and out of the starting line-up because of injuries and the appointment of Avram Grant following the departure of Mourinho. During the Christmas period, however, Shevchenko enjoyed a good run of form. He scored the first goal in Chelsea&#x27;s 2–0 win over Sunderland, and he was named man of the match in Chelsea&#x27;s 4–4 draw against Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge, scoring twice (including a stunning 25-yard shot into the top left hand corner) and assisting Alex to make the score 3–2 in Chelsea&#x27;s favour. Shevchenko scored his last goal in the 2007–08 season in a 1–1 draw with Bolton Wanderers. He finished the season with five league goals in 17 games. Shevchenko also played a part in a pre-season match which was against his former team, Milan.

====Loan to AC Milan====
Shevchenko was not used very often in the starting line-up at Chelsea, and with the appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari, he was deemed surplus to requirements. Due to this, Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani offered to take Shevchenko back to the San Siro and Shevchenko was loaned back to his old club for the 2008–09 season.

Shevchenko failed to score any league goals and only scored 2 goals in 26 appearances, starting only nine of those games. He returned to Chelsea for the final year of his four-year contract, where he was joined by his former Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti.

==== Departure ====
Shevchenko was not even on the bench for Chelsea&#x27;s penalty shoot-out victory over Manchester United at Wembley at the weekend in the season-opening Community Shield. After making a late appearance for Chelsea in their second game of the 2009–10 season, Ancelotti announced that Shevchenko would be likely to leave Chelsea before the summer transfer window closed. Despite this, Ancelotti said it had nothing to do with his decision to leave Shevchenko out of Chelsea&#x27;s 2009–10 Champions League squad, but just to continue playing first-team football.

===Return to Dynamo Kyiv===
On 28 August 2009, Shevchenko signed a two-year deal at his former club Dynamo Kyiv and scored a penalty-goal in his first game upon returning to his former club against Metalurh Donetsk in Dynamo&#x27;s 3–1 victory on 31 August. He was mostly used as a left winger and central mid-fielder, and was named left winger in the 2009 team of the season. On 16 September, Shevchenko played his first Champions League match after returning to Dynamo, against Rubin Kazan, in Dynamo&#x27;s first game of the 2009–10 season. In October, he was named the best player of the Ukrainian Premier League. On 4 November, he scored a goal in the game against Inter, cross-city rivals of his former club Milan, in the fourth game of the Champions League season. It was the 15th goal he had scored against Inter in his career.

On 28 July 2012, Shevchenko announced that he was quitting football for politics.

==International career==

Shevchenko earned 111 appearances and scored 48 goals for the Ukraine national team, representing the country at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. He debuted in 1995 in a friendly match against Croatia
 and scored his first international goal in May 1996 in another friendly match against Turkey.

Shevchenko scored six goals in qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, to take his country to its first ever major tournament. He captained the team at the finals and scored in Ukraine&#x27;s first ever World Cup win, a 4–0 defeat of Saudi Arabia. He then scored the winning goal from a penalty kick as Ukraine beat Tunisia 1–0 to qualify for the second round where, despite Shevchenko failing with their first kick, Ukraine knocked out Switzerland on penalties. Ukraine were then beaten 3–0 by eventual champions Italy at the quarter-final stage.
In a 21 December 2009 interview with UEFA, Shevchenko declared that he was keen to play in his home country at Euro 2012. &quot;After a disappointing 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign, that is my new challenge, or even dream. I will do everything to achieve that.&quot; In May 2012, Shevchenko was named in the Ukrainian squad for Euro 2012. In Ukraine&#x27;s opening game, Shevchenko scored two headers to beat Sweden 2–1 in Group D. After his country was eliminated from the group, Shevchenko announced he would retire from international football, having been Ukraine&#x27;s youngest and oldest goalscorer and record marksman with 48 goals in 111 appearances.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
A fast, hardworking, energetic, and well-rounded striker, Shevchenko was a prolific and highly opportunistic goalscorer, who was usually deployed as an out-and-out striker in a centre-forward role, although he was capable of operating anywhere along the front line, and often played in a free role, in which he could attack from the left wing, and get past opposing defenders with his runs into the penalty area, courtesy of his pace and movement off the ball. He also occupied a wider position as an outright winger on the left flank at times, in particular at the beginning of his career, and also during his second stint with Dynamo Kyiv during his later years; he was also capable of playing on the right. Shevchenko was also effective from set-pieces, and was an accurate penalty taker. A strong and physical striker with a clinical eye for goal, he was primarily known for his excellent positional sense, movement off the ball, and finishing ability inside the box, as well as his composure in front of goal; moreover, he possessed a powerful and accurate shot with either foot, from both inside and outside the area. Although he was not known to take part in aerial duels frequently, he was also good in the air, due to his heading ability. Often compared by pundits to fellow former Milan striker Marco van Basten, although he was not as elegant as the Dutch forward, he also possessed good technical skills himself, which along with his pace and physicality, made him effective when dribbling or carrying the ball at speed on the run. Furthermore, despite mainly being a goalscorer, he was capable of playing off of his teammates and providing assists, in addition to scoring goals himself, due to his link-up play.

===Reception===
Shevchenko is considered by several pundits to be one of the greatest strikers of all time, as well as one of the best footballers of his generation, and Ukraine’s greatest player ever. In 2004, he was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration.

==Coaching and managerial career==
===Ukraine national team===

In November 2012, Shevchenko initially refused to accept Football Federation of Ukraine&#x27;s proposal to become head coach of the Ukraine national team.

From 16 February to 15 July 2016, Shevchenko served as the assistant manager of the Ukraine national team. On 15 July 2016, Shevchenko was appointed as manager of the Ukraine national team. The 39-year-old replaced Mykhaylo Fomenko, whose four-year spell ended with elimination at the group stage of Euro 2016. He signed a two-year contract with the possibility of another two-year extension. Former Italy and Milan defender Mauro Tassotti, who was assistant coach when Shevchenko was at Milan, joined his coaching staff, as did former Dynamo coach Raúl Riancho, and former Milan Youth System coach Andrea Maldera. On 14 October 2019, Shevchenko led Ukraine to qualify for Euro 2020 with a 2–1 home win over reigning European champions Portugal.

At UEFA Euro 2020, Shevchenko led Ukraine to reach the quarter-finals of the European Championship for the first time in their history. His side finished as one of the four best third-placed teams in the group stage, then beating Sweden in extra time in the round of 16 and suffering an exit to England in the next round. Despite Ukraine’s successful tournament, on 1 August 2021, he announced his departure from the post.

===Genoa===
On 7 November 2021, Shevchenko was announced as the new head coach of Serie A side Genoa, following the club&#x27;s takeover by US investment firm 777 Partners, replacing Davide Ballardini. He signed a contract until 2024 for the 18th-placed team who had won once in 12 games. Two weeks later, he lost 2–0 on his debut at home to Roma, managed by his former Chelsea boss José Mourinho. On 15 January 2022, Shevchenko was sacked after two months having won just one match and lost seven during the time.

==Political career==
In the late 1990s, Shevchenko and other teammates of Dynamo Kyiv publicly backed the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united), whose members were the club&#x27;s then-owner and president Hryhoriy Surkis and then-vice president Viktor Medvedchuk.

After his retirement in June 2012, Shevchenko immediately joined Ukraine – Forward! (formerly known as Ukrainian Social Democratic Party) and took second place on the party list for the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election. This was in spite of him stating a month earlier that he wanted to coach after his playing career: &quot;This is the world I understand, the world I want to stay in.&quot; In the election his party won 1.58% of the national votes and no constituencies and thus failed to win parliamentary representation.

==National Olympic Committee of Ukraine==
Shevchenko became the Vice President of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine on 17 November 2022. He left the National Olympic Committee in January 2023 due to disagreement with the results of the election of its new President Vadym Gutzeit.

==Personal life==
Shevchenko&#x27;s first name ( in Ukrainian) has multiple ways of being transliterated from its original spelling in the Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet into the Latin alphabet; &quot;Andriy&quot; is the spelling used throughout the player&#x27;s official web site. It has also been adopted by UEFA and FIFA and is the preferred spelling in most English publications.

Shevchenko is married to American model Kristen Pazik, daughter of baseball player Mike Pazik. The couple met at a Giorgio Armani afterparty in 2002 and married on 14 July 2004 in a private ceremony on a golf course in Washington, D.C. As of 2006, the couple communicated in Italian as he did not speak English and she did not speak Russian. After his return to Dynamo Kyiv in August 2009, the couple declared that they want their children to learn Ukrainian.

The couple have four sons born between 2004 and 2014. Shevchenko commemorated his first son&#x27;s birth by scoring the only goal against Sampdoria; Milan owner and former Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi was the boy&#x27;s godfather. The day after his second son&#x27;s birth in 2006, Shevchenko scored in a 4–0 Chelsea victory over Watford and he and several of his teammates gathered and performed the popular &quot;rock-the-baby&quot; goal celebration as a tribute.

Shevchenko is a close friend of fashion designer Giorgio Armani, and has modelled for Armani and opened two boutiques with him in Kyiv. With his wife, he has started an e-commerce Web site called Ikkon.com, dedicated to men&#x27;s fashion and lifestyle. 

In June 2005, he became an ambassador for the SOS Children&#x27;s Villages charity. Shevchenko also has a foundation to support orphaned children.

In 2022, Shevchenko became an ambassador for United24, a government-supported aid organization in Ukraine.

Shevchenko, an avid golfer, participated in his first professional golf tournament, the Kharkov Superior Cup, in September 2013.

Shevchenko represented the Rest of the World team against England for Soccer Aid on 8 June 2014.

Besides his native Russian, Shevchenko also speaks English, Italian and to some extent Ukrainian. He has said that he is working to improve his Ukrainian.

Shevchenko has appealed for an end to the War in Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

==Media==
Shevchenko features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover of &quot;FIFA 2005&quot;, and was introduced as one of the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot; and was an Ultimate Team Legend until FIFA 18, when he became an Icon, as Legends were rebranded to Icons.

<text>Abedi Ayew ( ; born 5 November 1964), known professionally as Abedi Pele, is a Ghanaian former professional footballer who played as an attacking midfielder and served as captain of the Ghana national team. He is regarded as one of the greatest African footballers of all time. He played for several European clubs and found his fame in the French Ligue 1 with Lille and Marseille. At the latter, he won the UEFA Champions League in 1993, among other titles. He was also the first to win the CAF award in 1992.

== Early life ==
Abedi Ayew was born into a family in the town of Kibi and grew up in the town of Dome at the northern outskirts of the city Accra.

He attended Ghana Senior High School in Tamale. He was given the nickname &quot;Pelé&quot; due to his ability in football, which evoked comparisons to the late Brazilian athlete Pelé.

== Club career ==
Abedi Pele was one of the first African players to make an impact on European club football. His nomadic career began with Real Tamale United in Ghana in 1978. He left Ghana after the 1982 African Cup of Nations to join Al Sadd in Qatar for a $1,000 transfer fee. After a short spell with FC Zürich, he returned to Ghana but, after both Kotoko and Hearts of Oak failed to sign him, joined AS Dragons FC de l&#x27;Ouémé in Benin. He would later return to Ghana and play for Real Tamale United for one season. He began his career in Europe with French side Chamois Niort, subsequently joining Marseille before transferring to Lille on loan.

At club level, he was a key figure in Marseille&#x27;s dominance of the French league, resulting in four league championships and two European Cup finals appearances. At Marseille, he was a member of the team&#x27;s &quot;Magical Trio&quot; along with Jean-Pierre Papin and Chris Waddle, spearheading perhaps Europe&#x27;s strongest league side of the early 1990s, including a European Cup final defeat in 1991. Abedi Pele was the only remaining member of the trio still with the side when Marseille defeated Milan in the 1993 Champions League final in Munich.

He later joined Lyon after his loan spell at Lille. He also played for Torino of Italy and rounded out his European career with 1860 Munich.

Abedi Pele signed a two-year contract with Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates and was nominated one of the best foreign players to play in the UAE league.

== International career ==
Abedi Pele played for Ghana 73 times. He was a fixture in the African Championships of the 1980s and &#x27;90s with his national team, and a member of Ghana&#x27;s victorious team in the 1982 African Cup of Nations, but he never had an opportunity to play in the FIFA World Cup, as the &quot;Black Stars&quot; failed to qualify for the competition during his career. However, he was arguably the most dominant figure on the African football scene for nearly a decade. His performance in the 1992 African Cup of Nations, for which he was voted the player of the tournament, was particularly notable, as he scored in three successive rounds to help Ghana reach the final, but picked up a yellow card in the semi-final against Nigeria that meant he was suspended for the final; Ghana went on to lose on penalties to the Ivory Coast. The performance earned him the added nickname of &quot;The African Maradona&quot;.

Abedi Pele was one of the first African football players to earn a top placing in FIFA World Player of the Year voting, doing so in 1991 and 1992. He won the &quot;France Football&quot; African Player of the Year Award three consecutive years, was the inaugural winner of the BBC African Sports Star of the Year in 1992, and the corresponding Confederation of African Football award twice.

Abedi Pele holds the record for most appearances at the African Cup of Nations. He made his first appearance at the in Libya in 1982 and continued to compete at the tournament for the next 16 years, his last appearance coming in the 1998 edition in Burkina Faso. Aside from his exploits at the 1992 competition, he also earned much acclaim for his three goals at the 1996 competition, where he led Ghana to the semi-finals of the competition despite critics expecting him to be in the twilight of his career.

== After retirement ==
Abedi Pele has participated in more FIFA organized charity matches than any other African player. He is a member of FIFA&#x27;s Football Committee, and of the player status committees of both FIFA and CAF. The South African FA made him a apokesperson for their 2006 World Cup bid.

In appreciation of Abedi Pele&#x27;s service to the country, the Ghanaian government gave him the country&#x27;s highest honour, the Order of the Volta (civil division). He was the first Ghanaian sportsman to be so honoured.

On 29 January 1997, the first UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup All-Star Match between Europe and Africa was played in Benfica&#x27;s Estádio da Luz in Lisbon and was televised in 100 countries worldwide, including 30 in Africa, for an audience of 60 million viewers. Abedi Pele scored a goal early in the first half and, after Vincent Guérin had equalised for Europe just before half-time, it was the 1998 African Player of the Year, Mustapha Hadji, who struck Africa&#x27;s 78th-minute winner in the 2–1 win.

In 2001, the UEFA–CAF Meridian Cup All-Star Match format was changed slightly for the second All-Star Match to bring together players aged between 35 and 45 who now revel in their &#x27;veteran&#x27; status and play the game purely for pleasure. The squad sparked off memories of great footballing moments at club and international level.

=== Football ambassador ===
In June 2001 he was nominated by the present government of Ghana to serve as the next chairman of the FA, an opportunity he later gave up for a more experienced former coach of Ghana for which in his own words said that this was to be an opportunity to learn from his superiors.

At present he owns a first division club, called Nania, with the future hopes of nurturing the young talent to augment the fledgling league of the country. He has also been involved with charity work across the African continent.

=== Controversy ===
Abedi Pele was embroiled in a serious alleged Second Division Promotion Play-off bribery scandal for which the Ghana Football Association found him and others guilty. The guilty verdict attracted fines and suspensions of Abedi Pele and others, but these were quashed by the Appeals Committee of the Football Association after determining that there were irregularities in the initial judgement of the Ghana Football Association. The allegations stem from an astonishing 31–0 victory recorded by his club, Nania FC over a much respected Okwawu United side. A similarly farcical 28–0 result was recorded in another second division match played between Great Mariners and Tudu Mighty Jets on the same weekend. The clubs involved in that Second Division Promotion Play-off Zone III match were also investigated and subject to the prospect of stiff penalties and demotions. Despite his vehement denials, Abedi Pele had been chastised by some members of the Ghanaian media, who were demanding that strong punitive actions be taken against him, by Ghana&#x27;s football governing body as well as the legal system. His wife Maha Ayew was banned from football against this manipulations scandal on 3 November 2008.

== Style of play ==
As a playmaker, Abedi Pele was known for his speed, close control, and dribbling skills, as well as his passing and goalscoring ability. He usually played as an attacking midfielder or as a forward. He was also given the nicknames the &quot;Maestro&quot; and &quot;The African Maradona.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Abedi Pele is the brother of Kwame and Sola Ayew (ex-Hearts of Oak and Black Meteors). He is also the father of André, Jordan, Rahim, Imani, and is married to Maha. His sons, Ibrahim, André and Jordan, have also become internationals for Ghana. André and Rahim – represented Ghana in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa while Jordan and André represented Ghana in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil and the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.

<doc id="616629" wikidata="Q173139" url="?curid=616629" title="George Weah">
<text>George Manneh Oppong Weah (born 1 October 1966) is a Liberian politician and former professional footballer who served as the 25th president of Liberia from 2018 to 2024. Before his election for the presidency, Weah served as senator from Montserrado County. He played as a striker in his prolific 18-year professional football career which ended in 2003. Weah is the first African former professional footballer to become a head of state, and the only African Ballon d&#x27;Or and FIFA World Player of the Year winner in history, winning both awards in 1995. He won the African Footballer of the Year 3 times and is considered one of the greatest strikers ever.

After beginning his career in his native Liberia, Weah spent 14 years playing for clubs in France, Italy, and England. Arsène Wenger brought him to Europe, signing him for Monaco in 1988. Weah moved to Paris Saint-Germain in 1992 where they won Division 1 in 1994 and became the top scorer of the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League. He signed for AC Milan in 1995 where he spent four successful seasons, winning the Serie A twice. Later in his career, he joined the Premier League having spells at Chelsea and Manchester City, winning the FA Cup with Chelsea, before returning to France to play for Marseille in 2001. He ended his career with Al Jazira in 2003. &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; named Weah one of the best players never to win the UEFA Champions League.

Weah represented Liberia at the international level, winning 75 caps, scoring 18 goals for his country, and playing at the African Cup of Nations on two occasions. He also played in a friendly in 2018, where his number 14 jersey was retired. Regarded as one of the best players never to have played at the FIFA World Cup, Scott Murray in &quot;The Guardian&quot; refers to Weah as &quot;hamstrung by hailing from a global minnow&quot;.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest African players of all time, Weah was named FIFA World Player of the Year and won the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1995, becoming the first and only player to win these awards while representing an African country internationally. In 1989 and 1995, he was also named the African Footballer of the Year winning the official award twice, and in 1996, he was named African Player of the Century. Known for his acceleration, speed, and dribbling ability, in addition to his goal-scoring, Weah was described by FIFA as &quot;the precursor of the multi-functional strikers of today&quot;. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

Weah became involved in politics in Liberia following his retirement from football. He formed the Congress for Democratic Change and ran unsuccessfully for president in the 2005 election, losing to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in the second round of voting. In the 2011 election, he ran unsuccessfully for vice president alongside Winston Tubman. Weah was subsequently elected to the Senate of Liberia for Montserrado County in the 2014 election. Weah was elected President of Liberia in the 2017 election, defeating the incumbent vice president Joseph Boakai, and was sworn in on 22 January 2018. Weah was defeated in a rematch with Boakai in the 2023 election.

== Early life and education ==
George Manneh Oppong Weah was born on 1 October 1966 in Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia, and was raised in Clara Town, a slum in the city. He is a member of the Kru ethnic group, which hails from south-eastern part of Liberia, one of the poorest areas of the country. His father, William T. Weah Sr., was a mechanic while his mother, Anna Quaye Weah (d. 2013), was a merchant. He has three brothers, William, Moses, and Wolo. He was one of thirteen children largely raised by his devoutly Christian paternal grandmother, Emma Klonjlaleh Brown after his parents separated when Weah was still a baby. He attended middle school at Muslim Congress and high school at Wells Hairston High School and reportedly dropped out in his final year of studies.

== Football career ==
=== Club career ===
==== Early career in Liberia, Cameroon, Monaco and France ====
Weah began to play football for Young Survivors, a club based in Clara Town, in 1981 at the age of 15. Jason Burke, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, described how Weah scored &quot;two spectacular goals&quot; on his debut, &quot;one hit from such a tight angle that it went in-off having struck both posts&quot;. In his three years with Young Survivors, the club earned two promotions, from the fourth level of football in Liberia to the second. He signed for Liberian Premier League club Bong Range United in 1984, where he played for one season, before joining Mighty Barrolle, one of the biggest clubs in Liberia. Weah was not a regular starter for Mighty Barrolle despite scoring regularly, which prompted a move to their rivals, Invincible Eleven, in 1986. He helped the club win the 1987 Liberian Premier League title, was the league&#x27;s top scorer, and was named as the league&#x27;s player of the season. Before his football career allowed him to move abroad, Weah worked for the Liberia Telecommunications Corporation as a switchboard operator. He signed for Cameroonian Premier League club Tonnerre Yaoundé in 1987 after impressing during a match against them, and scored twice on his debut against Canon Yaoundé.

Weah&#x27;s abilities were noticed by the Cameroon national team manager, Claude Le Roy, who recommended him to Arsène Wenger, the manager of French Division 1 club Monaco. Weah signed for Monaco 1988 for a transfer fee of £12,000, after Wenger had flown to Africa prior to the signing to see him play. Weah has credited Wenger as an important influence on his career. During his time with Monaco, Weah was named the African Footballer of the Year for the first time in 1989. This was his first major award and he took it back home for the entire country to celebrate. Weah won the 1990–91 Coupe de France, playing in the final on 8 June in which Monaco beat Marseille 1–0 at the Parc des Princes. He helped Monaco reach the final of the 1991–92 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, scoring four goals in nine cup appearances.

Weah subsequently played for Paris Saint-Germain (1992–1995), with whom he won the Coupe de France in 1993 and 1995, Division 1 in 1994, and the Coupe de la Ligue in 1995 during a highly prolific and successful period; he also became the top scorer of the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League, with seven goals, after reaching the semi-finals with the club, one of which was a skillful individual &quot;wonder-goal&quot; against Bayern Munich in the group stage, on 23 November 1994. During his time at the club, he also managed to reach the semi-finals of the 1992–93 UEFA Cup, and the semi-finals of the 1993–94 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup; in total, he scored 16 goals in 25 European games. In 1994, he won the African Footballer of the Year Award for the second time in his career.

==== AC Milan and individual success ====
Weah joined AC Milan in 1995, winning the Italian league in 1996 under Fabio Capello. He played alongside Roberto Baggio and Dejan Savićević in Milan&#x27;s attack, as well as Marco Simone on occasion, and finished the season as Milan&#x27;s top goalscorer. He won the Serie A title once again in 1999. During his time with the club, he also reached the 1998 Coppa Italia final, and finished as runner-up in the Supercoppa Italiana on two occasions, in 1996 and 1999. Despite their European dominance in the early 1990s, Milan was less successful in Europe during this time, however, with their best result being a quarter-final finish in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup. 

Exhibiting skill, athleticism and goalscoring prowess, Weah became famous at Milan for scoring several notable goals, in particular a solo goal against Hellas Verona at the San Siro which saw him deftly control the ball from Verona&#x27;s corner kick just outside his penalty area, before he set off. With all his teammates back defending the corner Weah made a beeline for goal, leaving his teammates in his wake. His teammate Zvonimir Boban stated, &quot;It was an incredible run. We were thinking, &#x27;When&#x27;s he going to stop? When&#x27;s he going to stop? He&#x27;s not going to stop! He&#x27;s never going to stop!&#x27;&quot;. Weah finished by rifling the ball into the bottom left corner before an exuberant goal celebration.

Due to his performances with both Paris Saint-Germain and Milan, in 1995 Weah was the recipient of several individual awards: he won the Ballon d&#x27;Or, the Onze d&#x27;Or, and was named FIFA World Player of the Year, becoming the first and, currently, only African player (by FIFA nationality) to win these awards, and second African-born player to do so after Eusébio. Weah dedicated his FIFA World Player of the Year victory to his former manager, Arsène Wenger, stating that it was thanks to him that he was able to develop into a world-class player. That year, Weah also won the African Player of the Year Award for the third time in his career, and was named to the &quot;Onze de Onze&quot; by the French football magazine &quot;Onze Mondial&quot;. In 1996, Weah finished second in the FIFA World Player of the Year ranking; he was also the recipient of the FIFA Fair Play Award, and was voted the African Player of the Century by sport journalists from around the world.

On 20 November 1996, after Milan&#x27;s Champions League draw at Porto, Weah broke the nose of Portuguese defender Jorge Costa in the players&#x27; tunnel, resulting in a six-match European ban. Weah said he exploded in frustration after putting up with racist tauntings from Costa during both of the team&#x27;s Champions League matches that autumn. UEFA did not charge Costa because no witnesses, including his Milan teammates, could verify Weah&#x27;s allegations. Costa strenuously denied the accusations of racism and was not charged by UEFA as no witnesses could verify Weah&#x27;s allegations, not even his Milan teammates. Weah later attempted to apologise to Costa but this was rebuffed by the Portuguese, who considered the charges of racist insults levelled against him to be defamatory and took Weah to court. The incident led to Costa undergoing facial surgery and he was subsequently sidelined for three weeks. Despite the incident, Weah still received the FIFA Fair Play Award in 1996.

==== Later career ====
Weah signed for English Premier League club Chelsea on loan from Milan on 11 January 2000, in a deal which would keep him with the West London club until the end of the 1999–2000 season. Although past his prime, Weah&#x27;s time in England was deemed a success, especially at Chelsea where he instantly endeared himself to their fans by scoring the winner against rivals Tottenham Hotspur on his debut, and scored further league goals against Wimbledon and Liverpool. He also scored twice in Chelsea&#x27;s victorious 1999–2000 FA Cup netting crucial goals against Leicester City and Gillingham. This led to him starting in the final, which Chelsea won 1–0.

Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli did not make Weah&#x27;s move permanent, and, on 1 August 2000, he officially left Milan, and signed for newly promoted Premier League side Manchester City on a free transfer on a two-year contract worth £30,000 a week, declining the offer of a £1 million pay-off from Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi. He played 11 games in all competitions for City, scoring four times, before leaving on 16 October 2000 after becoming dissatisfied with manager Joe Royle for selecting him as a substitute too frequently; he had only played the full 90 minutes in three of his 11 games for the Maine Road club. At City, he scored once in the league against Liverpool (as he did at Chelsea), and three times against Gillingham (again as he had at Chelsea), this time in the League Cup; once in the first leg and twice in the second.

Following his time in England, Weah returned to France and had a spell at Marseille, where he remained until May 2001. He later played with Al Jazira in the UAE Football League, where he remained until his retirement as a player in 2003, at age 37. He had planned on joining the New York/New Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer but elected to join Al Jazira temporarily.

=== International career ===
Since making his debut for the Liberia national team against Burkina Faso on 23 February 1986, Weah played 75 games, scoring 18 goals. Representing one of the smaller nations in world football and perennial underdogs, Weah did much to support the national squad: aside from being the team&#x27;s star player, he also later coached the squad and even funded his national side to a large extent. Despite his efforts, he was unsuccessful in helping Liberia qualify for a single FIFA World Cup, falling just a point short in qualifying for the 2002 tournament. However, he did help Liberia to qualify for the African Cup of Nations on two occasions: Weah represented his country in the 1996 and 2002 editions of the tournament, although Liberia failed to make it out of their group both times, suffering first-round eliminations.

Weah has been named by several media outlets as one of the best players to never play at the World Cup.

Weah returned to the national team for a specially arranged friendly against Nigeria on 11 September 2018, his final international appearance, playing at the age of 51 while in office as the country&#x27;s president. His number 14 shirt, worn at his playing peak, was retired after the friendly, with Weah receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted.

=== Style of play ===
==== Player profile ====
During his prime in the 1990s, Weah was regarded as one of the best strikers in the world. He was lauded for his speed, work rate, stamina, and attacking instincts, as well as his physical and athletic attributes, which he combined with his finishing, technical ability, and creativity. A fast, powerful, physically strong player, with an eye for goal, many observers agree that he successfully filled the void left in the Milan attack by club great Marco van Basten. In addition to his pace, acceleration, dribbling skills, and goalscoring ability, as a multi-functional forward Weah was also a team player who was capable of creating chances and assisting goals for teammates.
Along with Ronaldo and Romário, Weah was viewed as a modern, new style of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area and run with the ball towards goal, at a time when strikers primarily operated inside the penalty area where they would receive the ball from teammates. Among the next generation of strikers who were inspired, Thierry Henry states, &quot;George Weah, Romário, and Ronaldo changed the game for me. It was the first time as a striker I saw players that could score on their own. Pick the ball up anywhere and score. Before as a number nine, people would say &#x27; Stay within the line of the box, don&#x27;t move too much, don&#x27;t go to the wings, don&#x27;t drop, stay.&#x27; Then I saw George Weah. And then I saw Ronaldo. And I saw Romário differently before those two. And it was like &#x27;hang on a minute, someone has lied to me&#x27;.&quot;

One such goal that exemplified this ability was against Verona in 1995 where he received the ball in the edge of his penalty box and ran the length of the field. Scoring such a goal in Serie A – the best defensive league in the world – saw media outlets such as &quot;Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; running pages of analysis for days afterward, and calling it the greatest strike of all in Italian football. On his impact on the sport, Weah states, &quot;When I look at my idols – Pelé, Maradona, Beckenbauer, Cruyff – they did a lot of great things. I came into the game and made history too.&quot;

==== Reception ====
Named African Footballer of the Year three times and the first African to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or and be named FIFA World Player of the Year, Weah&#x27;s prominence in the 1990s led him to be nicknamed &quot;King George&quot;. &quot;90min&quot; included him in their list of the 50 greatest players of all time. Weah is often hailed as one of the greatest African footballers of all time, being named African Player of the Century in 1996, and often ranked among the three greatest African strikers ever, alongside Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto&#x27;o. In 2013, Milan great Franco Baresi named Weah in the greatest XI he has ever played with. &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine named Weah one of the best players never to win the UEFA Champions League. A number of publications, including Scott Murray of &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Kevin Baxter of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in addition to FIFA, consider him to be one of the greatest players never to feature at the World Cup.

The status of Weah in the sport saw him feature in EA Sports&#x27; &quot; FIFA&quot; video game series where he was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;. During his playing career Weah was sponsored by sportswear company Diadora, and he became famous for his red Diadora boots while playing for AC Milan.

== Humanitarianism ==
Weah is a devoted humanitarian for his war-torn country. During his playing career he became a UN Goodwill Ambassador. At the 2004 ESPY Awards at the Kodak Theatre, Los Angeles, Weah won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award for his efforts. He has also been named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, a role which he has suspended in his political career. Off the football pitch, he stood out throughout his career for his initiatives to fight against racism in the game.

=== Football and children ===
Weah has tried to use football as a way to bring happiness and promote education for children in Liberia. In 1998, Weah launched a CD called &quot;Lively Up Africa&quot; featuring the singer Frisbie Omo Isibor and eight other African football stars. The proceeds from this CD went to children&#x27;s programs in the countries of origin of the athletes involved.

Weah was President of Junior Professional, a former football club he founded in Monrovia in 1994. As a way to encourage young people to remain in school, the club&#x27;s only requirement for membership was school attendance. Many of the young people, recruited from all over Liberia, went on to play for the Liberian national team. Weah was also actively involved with youth programs in a Liberian enclave on Staten Island, New York, when he resided there for a time.

=== Football academies ===
The Diya Group chairman and Indian entrepreneur Nirav Tripathi announced a multimillion-dollar partnership with Weah in 2016, whereby global football academies would be established to help assist youth in both impoverished and emerging nations.

The motivation for the academies is cited as a shared experience between both Tripathi and Weah in how sport can transform lives in their nations of India and Liberia, which both still suffer from severe poverty.

== Political career ==
=== 2005 presidential bid ===
Following the end of the Second Liberian Civil War, Weah announced his intention to run for President of Liberia in the 2005 election, forming the Congress for Democratic Change to back his candidacy. While Weah was a popular figure in Liberia, opponents cited his lack of formal education as a handicap to his ability to lead the country, in contrast with his Harvard-educated opponent, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Analysts also noted Weah&#x27;s lack of experience, calling him a &quot;babe-in-the-woods&quot;, while Sirleaf had served as minister of finance in the William Tolbert administration in the 1970s and had held positions at Citibank, the World Bank and the United Nations. Weah&#x27;s eligibility to run for presidency was also called into question as it was reported that he had become a French citizen in his footballing career at Paris Saint-Germain, but these complaints were rebuffed by the electoral commission in court and Weah was allowed to proceed.

Weah obtained a plurality of votes in the first round of voting on 11 October, garnering 28.3% of the vote. This qualified him to compete in a run-off election against Sirleaf, the second placed candidate. However, he lost the run-off to Sirleaf on 8 November, garnering only 40.6% to 59.4% for Sirleaf. Weah alleged that the election had been rigged through voter intimidation and ballot tampering, and many of his supporters protested the results in the streets of Monrovia. However, after assurances that the vote was fair, several prominent African leaders called on Weah&#x27;s supporters to accept the result with grace and dignity, and Sirleaf became president. The African Union had characterised the election as &quot;peaceful, transparent, and fair&quot;.

Weah&#x27;s lack of education became a campaign issue. He has been highly critical of those who say he is not fit to govern: &quot;With all their education and experience, they have governed this nation for hundreds of years. They have never done anything for the nation.&quot; He initially claimed to have a BA degree in sport management from Parkwood University in London; however, this is an unaccredited diploma mill, which awards certificates without requiring study. Weah then pursued a degree in business administration at DeVry University in Miami.
=== 2009–2016 ===
Weah also remained active in Liberian politics, returning from the United States in 2009 to successfully campaign for the Congress for Democratic Change candidate in the Montserrado County senatorial by-election. Some analysts saw these moves as preparation for a repeat run for the presidency in 2011, and Weah did indeed later announce his intention to challenge Sirleaf in the 2011 election. After a series of failed alliances with other opposition parties, the Congress for Democratic Change chose Weah as its 2011 vice presidential candidate, running with presidential candidate Winston Tubman. The Tubman/ Weah ticket managed to capture 32.7% of the vote in the first round with Sirleaf getting 43.9% of the vote. As neither had a majority the election, following the two-round system, proceeded to the next round. However, in the second round Sirleaf was re-elected, with the Tubman / Weah ticket receiving only 9.3% of the vote.

In 2014, he ran for election to the Senate of Liberia as a Congress for Democratic Change candidate in Montserrado County. He was elected to the Liberian Senate on 20 December 2014. Weah defeated Robert Sirleaf, the son of President Sirleaf, becoming the first Liberian international athlete elected to represent a county in the legislature. He won a landslide victory, receiving 99,226 votes, which represented 78.0% of the total votes from the 141 polling centers, while Sirleaf, his closest rival received 13,692 votes, which is nearly 11% in the election marred only by a low turnout. Following his election, Weah only occasionally attended sessions of the Senate and did not introduce or sponsor any legislation.

=== 2016 presidential bid ===
In April 2016, Weah announced his intention to run for President of Liberia in the 2017 election, standing for the Coalition for Democratic Change. After winning the first round of the 2017 election with 38.4% of the vote, he and Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party went into the second round of the election. In the second round, Weah was elected President of Liberia, winning a run-off against vice president Joseph Boakai with more than 60% of the vote.

== Presidency (2018–2024) ==
Weah was sworn in as president on 22 January 2018, making him the fourth youngest-serving president in Africa, marking Liberia&#x27;s first democratic transition in 74 years. He cited fighting corruption, reforming the economy, combating illiteracy and improving life conditions as the main targets of his presidency. Two other world class African strikers, Didier Drogba and Samuel Eto&#x27;o, attended the inauguration.

=== Economic policy ===
After winning 2017 election, Weah promised a Pro-Poor Agenda for Development and Prosperity, saying that this will benefit not just the poor, but all Liberians.

In 2019 inflation went as high as 28%. It made many Liberians to worry which led protests called &quot;Save the State&quot; in Monrovia and in Washington, D.C.

In September 2019, Weah attended the National Economic Dialogue (NED), seeking solutions amidst Liberia&#x27;s economic crisis. A host of organizations rallied to develop a comprehensive program aimed at bolstering Liberia&#x27;s economy. Weah urged Liberians to use the Dialogue as a national platform to craft strategies and offer workable solutions for the crisis. The forum yielded several recommendations, some of which are listed below:

* Review of recommendations of the TRC including the establishment of economic and war crimes court
* Printing of new currency
* Broad-based review of the national custom code
* Recapitalization of the Central Bank of Liberia
* Review of domestic and external debts
* Practical agriculture programs, peace and national reconciliation

During his second year in office, Weah and his administration witnessed a deterioration in the economy, with inflation reaching 30%. This economic downturn, coupled with payment delays, triggered protests against which the police employed tear gas and water cannons.

During his fourth State of the Nation address, President Weah presented a series of proposed economic policies and legislative reforms, aiming to address the worsening economic conditions.

After Weah came to power, Liberia&#x27;s unemployment rate increased from 3% in 2017 to 4.1%. The Liberian economy grew 1–5% in the first five years of his administration (2018–2022).

=== Domestic policy ===
On 29 January 2018, in his first annual message to the national legislature, he reduced his salary and other benefits by 25% with immediate effect, stating, &quot;With the assessment that I gave you earlier of the poor condition of our economy, I believe that it is appropriate that we should all make sacrifices in the interest of our country. According to Article 60 of the Constitution of Liberia, the salaries of the president and the vice president are established by the Legislature of Liberia and cannot be increased or reduced during the period for which they are elected. However, in view of the very rapidly deteriorating situation of the economy, I am informing you today, with immediate effect, that I will reduce my salary and benefits by 25% and give the proceeds back to the Consolidated Fund for allocation and appropriation as they see fit.&quot;

On 29 January 2018, Weah announced he would seek constitutional changes to allow people of different ethnic descent to be citizens and allow foreigners to own land. He called the present situation &quot;racist and inappropriate&quot;.

On 12 September 2020, he declared a national emergency over sexual violence in the country, pledging to create a special prosecutor for rape, a national sex offender registry, and a national task force to tackle the issue. He further announced a 2 million dollar emergency fund, part of which was used to purchase DNA-testing equipment for forensic identification of perpetrators. However, as of March 2022, the DNA-testing equipment had yet to be made functional. As well, the special prosecutor had yet to be appointed, the sex offender registry had yet to be implemented, and specialized gender-based violence courts had only been implemented in three of the sixteen Liberian counties.

Weah signed a drug bill into law which passed by the legislature after months. The law aimed to regulate, restrict, control, limit, or eradicate the illegal export and importation as well as the flagrant use, abuse, and proliferation of narcotics within the nation.

Months before the 2023 election, he accepted the endorsement of the Bassa people for re-election. They did this because &quot;he has the competence and passion to develop Liberia.&quot;

Under his presidency Liberia has made improvements to education by constructing and renovating schools to make sure children have better education and environment.

=== Healthcare ===
Healthcare in Liberia improved since he became president in 2018. His administration invested into health infrastructure and medical equipment He also deployed doctors to many underserved areas of the country. Weah instituted health insurance programs. Liberia&#x27;s first dialysis center was built under his administration.

=== Foreign policy ===
Upon his election to office, Weah first made an official visit in Senegal to meet with President Macky Sall, to &quot;strengthen the bond between the two countries&quot;. On 21 February 2018, Weah made his first official visit outside Africa, to France, meeting French president Emmanuel Macron. The meeting focused on improving the relationship between France and Liberia and also sought French help for a sports development project in Africa. The meeting was also attended by Didier Drogba, Kylian Mbappé and FIFA president Gianni Infantino.
On 25 May 2018, following a meeting with President Weah, the Liberian Football Association president Musa Bility announced that Liberia would vote for the Canada–Mexico–United States World Cup bid, breaking ranks with the rest of Africa, who were voting for the Moroccan bid.

He made a visit to China to congratulate Xi Jinping on his re-election. President Weah said he looked forward to further cementing the strong ties that exist between both countries since establishment between both nations.

In July 2023, he met with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss topics of cementing ties, trade, cooperation on international affairs, peace, and security.

=== Criticism ===
As President, Weah has come under criticism for inciting violence on opposition candidates including Telia Urey in 2019. On 15 August 2022, three senior members of Weah&#x27;s cabinet were sanctioned by the United States for alleged corruption.

=== Song ===
On 25 March 2020, the Liberian president recorded his song with the local group The Rabbis, the text of which was written by himself. In this song &quot;He invites the Liberian and African population to stand up by all means against this virus [SARS-CoV-2] which is causing damage around the world.&quot;&quot;It could be your mother, it could be your dad, your brothers or your sisters. Let&#x27;s all stand together to fight this dirty virus&quot;-an extract from President Weah&#x27;s song on a reggae rhythm. The majority of people in Liberia do not have internet or Facebook access, but radio is a popular and very accessible form of entertainment in the African country.. The song would be played on various stations across the country to properly broadcast the message, according to the president&#x27;s spokesperson. Weah had already recorded a song against Ebola.

== Personal life ==
Weah has four children; three children with his Jamaican-born wife Clar Weah: George, Tita, and Timothy and a child from another relationship. In 2016, he was sued by the mother of his daughter for child support expenses. Both of his sons became footballers and signed for Paris Saint-Germain, although only Timothy played for the first team. Both played as youth internationals for the United States, and Timothy was capped for the senior team where he appeared and scored a goal at the 2022 World Cup against Wales. George Weah also has a less notable cousin called Stephen Weah, who also played as a footballer for Preston Lions FC of Melbourne, Australia.

Weah practiced Islam for ten years before converting to Christianity. In October 2017, he was spotted in the prominent Nigerian church of Pastor T. B. Joshua alongside Liberian senator Prince Johnson. Joshua was allegedly a key influence in Johnson&#x27;s decision to endorse Weah&#x27;s candidacy in the 2017 election.

Weah holds French citizenship and speaks French fluently.

<text>Fleury-sur-Orne (, literally &quot;Fleury on Orne&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. It is part of the Communauté urbaine Caen la Mer and of the agglomeration of Caen.

==History==
Until 1916 Fleury-sur-Orne was known as &quot;Allemagne (Calvados)&quot; after the Alamanni tribe which once guarded the ford across the Orne. During the First World War this name, meaning in French &quot;Germany&quot;, became inconvenient and embarrassing for the inhabitants (unlike those of Allemagne-en-Provence in Southern France). The town council therefore decided on 23 August 1916, to change the name and to call it Fleury-sur-Orne in memory of the commune of Fleury-devant-Douaumont, a commune of the Meuse (in 1914: 422 inhabitants, school, church, town hall, 13 tradesmen, 10 landholding farmers), which was destroyed in 1916.

===Massacre of the Athis fort===
In 1047, Duke William of Normandy (later William the Conqueror), helped by Henry I, king of France, put an end to a revolt of Norman barons at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes, close to the villages of Chicheboville, Secqueville and Bourguébus. Little is known about this battle, but it seems to have been a purely cavalry contest, with neither infantry nor archers playing a significant role.

After a series of disorderly cavalry skirmishes, the rebellious barons fled. They were slaughtered as they tried to cross the Orne, at the Athis fort close to Fleury-sur-Orne. Carried downstream &quot;en masse&quot;, the bodies of the massacred knights blocked the mill of Barbillon on the level of current Ile Enchantée.

The victory allowed William to remain Duke of Normandy, thus setting the stage for his later brilliant battles and statecraft.

<text>William Mason (12 February 1724 – 7 April 1797) was an English poet, divine, amateur draughtsman, author, editor and gardener.

==Life==
He was born in Hull and educated at Hull Grammar School and St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was ordained in 1754 and held a number of posts in the church.

In 1747, his poem &quot;Musaeus, a Monody on the Death of Mr. Pope&quot; was published to acclaim and quickly went through several editions. Summarizing this poem, a threnody, William Lyon Phelps writes:

Among his other works are the historical tragedies &quot;Elfrida&quot; (1752) and &quot;Caractacus&quot; (1759) (both used in translation as libretti for 18th century operas: &quot;Elfrida&quot; - Paisiello and LeMoyne, &quot;Caractacus&quot; - Sacchini (as &quot;Arvire et Évélina&quot;) and a long poem on gardening, &quot;The English Garden&quot; (three volumes, 1772–82). His garden designs included one for the Viscount Harcourt.

He entered the Church in 1754, and in 1762 became the precentor and canon of York Minster.

He was the friend, executor, and biographer of Thomas Gray, who was a great influence on his own work. In 1775 &quot;The Poems of Mr. Gray. To which are prefixed Memoirs of his Life and Writings by W[illiam]. Mason. York&quot;, was published. James Boswell said that in his &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; (1791) he &quot;resolved to adopt and enlarge upon the excellent plan of Mr Mason, in his Memoirs of Gray.&quot; Mason was also a friend of Horace Walpole and Joshua Reynolds.

Mason&#x27;s artwork was considered worthy of showing at the Royal Academy between 1782 and 1786. In 1785, he was William Pitt the Younger&#x27;s choice to succeed William Whitehead as Poet Laureate but refused the honour.

Two of his works of scenes at the York racecourse, &quot;A Country Racecourse with horses preparing to start&quot; and &quot;A Country Racecourse with horses running&quot;. were reproduced as mezzotint illustrations in 1786 by Francis Jukes in collaboration with Robert Pollard.

Memorial inscriptions for Mason may be found in the church at Aston near Rotherham where he was rector and at Poet&#x27;s Corner in Westminster Abbey. A cenotaph was also erected by Countess Harcourt in the gardens at Nuneham Courtenay.

He was the guardian of Francis Ferrand Foljambe during his minority.

<text>Loch Linnhe ( ) is a sea loch in the Highland Council area, in the west of Scotland. The part upstream of Corran is known in Gaelic as (the black pool, originally known as Loch Abar), and downstream as (the salty pool). The name &quot;Linnhe&quot; is derived from the Gaelic word , meaning &quot;pool&quot;.

Loch Linnhe follows the line of the Great Glen Fault, and is the only sea loch along the fault. About long, it opens onto the Firth of Lorne at its southwestern end. The part of the loch upstream of Corran is long and an average of about wide. The southern part of the loch is wider, and its branch southeast of the island of Lismore is known as the Lynn of Lorne.

Loch Eil feeds into Loch Linnhe at the latter&#x27;s northernmost point, while from the east Loch Leven feeds in the loch just downstream of Corran and Loch Creran feeds into the Lynn of Lorne. The town of Fort William lies at the northeast end of the loch, at the mouth of the River Lochy.

According to the Bard Fr. Allan MacDonald, an important figure in Scottish Gaelic literature, Loch Linnhe was said in local Scottish folklore to be the home of an each-uisge, or &quot;water horse&quot;, whose back could accommodate all the children who wished to ride him. But when they did, the water-horse would gallop off into the nearest lake to drown and eat the children on his back. Fr. Allan MacDonald later recalled that during his childhood in nearby Fort William, &quot;Many&#x27;s the horse I wouldn&#x27;t get on as a child for fear it would be the &quot;each-uisge&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="616658" wikidata="Q313940" url="?curid=616658" title="Hong Myung-bo">
<text>Hong Myung-bo (also spelled Hong Myeong-bo, , Hanja: 洪明甫; ; born 12 February 1969) is a South Korean football manager and former footballer who played as a sweeper. Hong is often considered one of the greatest Asian footballers of all time. He is the current manager of South Korea national team.

Hong was a member of the South Korean national team in four FIFA World Cups, and was the first Asian player to play in four consecutive FIFA World Cup tournaments. He is also the first Asian player ever to receive the Bronze Ball at the FIFA World Cup. He gained attention after showing his outstanding ability in the FIFA World Cup and AFC Asian Cup competitions. He received some votes in elections for the FIFA World Player of the Year, finishing 21st in 1996 and 17th in 2002. Furthermore, he was also selected for the FIFA 100, Pelé&#x27;s selection about the 125 greatest living footballers in the world.

==International career==
=== 1990 World Cup ===
Hong was named in South Korea&#x27;s squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup just four months after his international debut. The youngest South Korean player to participate in the tournament, Hong played all of the three matches in the group stage and received the most praise in South Korea despite losing all group matches.

=== 1994 World Cup ===
Hong was selected as a member of South Korean Universiade team in 1991. He stabilized South Korea&#x27;s defense, helping them advance to the final. He scored South Korea&#x27;s first penalty in the shoot-out after South Korea drew the final with the Netherlands without a goal during 120 minutes. Hong and South Korea won a gold medal by defeating the Netherlands on penalties.

Hong&#x27;s talent began to receive attention in earnest since the 1994 FIFA World Cup. When South Korea had only five minutes to catch up Spain, which was leading the match with the score of 2–0, he scored South Korea&#x27;s first goal outside the penalty area, and assisted his teammate Seo Jung-won to score the equaliser shortly after his goal. While South Korea was losing to defending champions Germany by conceding three goals in the first half, Hong scored one of South Korea&#x27;s two goals in the second half with a long-range shot.

=== 1998 World Cup ===
Hong participated in the 1994 Asian Games after the World Cup, but he injured his knee during the quarter-final match against Japan. South Korea lost to Uzbekistan in the semi-finals after he quit the tournament.

While Park Jong-hwan managed South Korean national team, Hong was in conflict with Park who had a coercive disposition, and was criticized for forming his faction in the team. He was also doubted whether he played the game lazily after South Korea lost 6–2 to Iran in the quarter-finals of the 1996 AFC Asian Cup.

Under the next manager Cha Bum-kun, South Korea recorded one draw and two defeats including a 5–0 loss to the Netherlands in the group stage of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Hong also failed to prevent South Korea&#x27;s elimination in the group stage.

=== 2002 World Cup ===
Hong was going to be selected as an over-aged player of South Korean under-23 team for the 2000 Summer Olympics, but he was injured just before the tournament.

In the 2000 AFC Asian Cup, Hong was selected for the All-Star Team, although South Korea failed to win the title by losing the semi-final match against Saudi Arabia.

Hong captained South Korea to a historic fourth-place finish in the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He scored the winning penalty to secure a 5–3 shoot-out victory after a goalless draw in the quarter-final match against Spain. The Technical Study Group voted Hong as the third best player of the tournament, giving the Bronze Ball to him. He became the first-ever Asian player to be named one of the top three players in a World Cup.

In that year, Hong ended his international career after a friendly match against World Cup champions Brazil as the all-time leader in appearances for South Korean national team.

==Style of play==
Hong didn&#x27;t have rapid pace, untiring stamina or outstanding ability in man-to-man defense, but he possessed a wide field of vision as well as great leadership skills with which he marshalled his defensive partners. An offensive sweeper, he was noted for his accurate long-range passing skills which greatly contributed to South Korea&#x27;s attack. He was nicknamed the &quot;Eternal Libero&quot; by the South Korean media, and became a preeminent icon of South Korean football during his era.

==Managerial career==

=== South Korea ===
On 26 September 2005, after his retirement as a player, Hong returned to the national team as assistant coach. Helping the manager Dick Advocaat, Hong took part in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and worked with the next manager Pim Verbeek in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup. After the resignation of Verbeek, he was one of the candidates to become the next manager.

The Korean FA announced that it had appointed Hong as the manager of the South Korea under-20 team, on 19 February 2009. Under his guidance the team reached the quarter-finals of the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup, but were eliminated due to a 3–2 defeat to Ghana, the eventual champions.

Hong also served an assistant coach for South Korea under-23 team under Park Sung-hwa. In October 2009, he took over the coaching duties at under-23 team. He led his team into third place in the 2010 Asian Games. On 10 August 2012, Hong Myung-bo coached the men&#x27;s Olympic team to a 2–0 win over Japan to secure the bronze medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics, which set up a record by obtaining the first medal ever for South Korea in Olympic football as well as being the first Asian team in 44 years to win a medal at that event.

Choi Kang-hee, the previous manager of South Korea, resigned from his position at the end of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. After working as assistant coach to Guus Hiddink at Russian Premier League club Anzhi Makhachkala for half a year, Hong was appointed as the new manager of the team on 24 June 2013 to prepare the team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. After a winless FIFA World Cup campaign, Hong resigned from his post on 10 July 2014.

=== Hangzhou Greentown ===
On 17 December 2015, Hong was appointed as the manager of Chinese Super League club Hangzhou Greentown. In his first match on 6 March 2016, he guided the team to a 2–1 win over Changchun Yatai. However, his team was relegated to the second division after the 2016 season. The next year, he resigned from the club and criticised the club&#x27;s owner for interfering in tactics and selection of players.

=== Ulsan Hyundai ===
On 24 December 2020, Hong was appointed as the manager of K League 1 club Ulsan Hyundai. He led the club to win two consecutive national league titles in 2022 and 2023.

=== Return to South Korea ===
On 8 July 2024, Hong was reappointed as the manager of the South Korea national team for the second time.

<doc id="616665" wikidata="Q1151801" url="?curid=616665" title="Waardenburg syndrome">
<text>Waardenburg syndrome is a group of rare genetic conditions characterised by at least some degree of congenital hearing loss and pigmentation deficiencies, which can include bright blue eyes (or one blue eye and one brown eye), a white forelock or patches of light skin. These basic features constitute type 2 of the condition; in type 1, there is also a wider gap between the inner corners of the eyes called telecanthus, or dystopia canthorum. In type 3, which is rare, the arms and hands are also malformed, with permanent finger contractures or fused fingers, while in type 4, the person also has Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease. There also exist at least two types (2E and PCWH) that can result in central nervous system (CNS) symptoms such as developmental delay and muscle tone abnormalities.
The syndrome is caused by mutations in any of several genes that affect the division and migration of neural crest cells during embryonic development (though some of the genes involved also affect the neural tube). Neural crest cells are stem cells left over after the closing of the neural tube that go on to form diverse non-CNS cells in different parts of the body, including melanocytes, various bones and cartilage of the face and inner ear and the peripheral nerves of the intestines. Type 1 is caused by a mutation in the &quot;PAX3&quot; gene, while the gene that most often causes type 2 when mutated is &quot;MITF&quot;. Type 3 is a more severe presentation of type 1 and is caused by a mutation in the same gene, while type 4 is most often caused by a mutation in &quot;SOX10&quot;. Mutations in other genes can also cause the different types, and some of these have been given their own lettered subtypes. Most types are autosomal dominant.
The estimated prevalence of Waardenburg syndrome is 1 in 42,000. Types 1 and 2 are the most common, comprising approximately half and a third of cases, respectively, while type 4 comprises a fifth and type 3 less than 2% of cases. An estimated 2–5% of congenitally deaf people have Waardenburg syndrome. Descriptions of the syndrome date back to at least the first half of the 20th century, however it is named after Dutch ophthalmologist and geneticist Petrus Johannes Waardenburg, who described it in 1951. Its subtypes were progressively discovered in the following decades and had genes attributed to them mostly in the 1990s and 2000s.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Waardenburg syndrome has multiple different types with some variations in symptoms, and symptoms can vary among those with the same type. The two features consistent across all types of Waardenburg syndrome are some degree of congenital sensorineural hearing loss and some degree of pigmentation deficiencies, most consistently in the eyes.

=== Type 1 ===
Type 1 is characterised by congenital sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary deficiencies of the hair such as a white lock of hair (poliosis) in the front-centre of the head or premature greying, pigmentary deficiencies of the eyes such as different-coloured eyes (complete heterochromia iridum), multiple colours in an eye (sectoral heterochromia iridum) or brilliant blue eyes, patches of skin depigmentation, and a wider gap between the inner corners of the eyes called telecanthus or dystopia canthorum. Other facial features associated with type 1 can include a high nasal bridge, a flat nose tip, a unibrow (synophrys), smaller edges of the nostrils (alae) or a smooth philtrum.

=== Type 2 ===

The difference that defines type 2 from type 1 is that patients do not have the wider gap between the inner corners of the eyes (telecanthus/dystopia canthorum). Sensorineural hearing loss tends to be more common and more severe in this type. By far the most common gene to cause this type when mutated is &quot;MITF&quot; (classified as type 2A). If two individuals with a mutation in this gene (heterozygous) have a child carrying both mutations (homozygous), for which there is a 25% chance, additional symptoms are present in the child, such as a hole in the iris (coloboma), small eyes (microphthalmia), hardened bones (osteopetrosis), macrocephaly, albinism and deafness.

There have been two known patients identified with mutations in both copies of &quot;SNAI2&quot; (classified as type 2D); these individuals presented with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 but did not have hair pigmentation deficiencies.

When Waardenburg syndrome type 2 is caused by a mutation in &quot;SOX10&quot; (classified as type 2E), it can on some occasions present with multiple neurological symptoms. These can include developmental delay, early childhood nystagmus, increased muscle tone, white matter anomalies or hypomyelination in the brain, autistic-like behaviour and the underdevelopment or complete absence of many inner-ear structures such as the vestibular system or cochlea. Lack of a sense of smell (anosmia) due to a missing olfactory bulb in the brain may also be present.

=== Type 3 ===
Also known as Klein–Waardenburg syndrome, or Waardenburg–Klein syndrome, type 3 has the same symptoms as type 1 (and is caused by mutations in the same gene) but has additional symptoms that affect the arms and hands. These can include joint contractures of the fingers (camptodactyly), due to underdeveloped muscles, as well as fused digits (syndactyly) or winged scapulae. Microcephaly and developmental delay are also possible.

=== Type 4 ===
Also known as Shah–Waardenburg syndrome, or Waardenburg–Shah syndrome, type 4 has most of the same features as type 2 (i.e. no telecanthus, or apparent wider eye gap), but with the addition of Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease, which is a congenital lack of nerves in the intestines leading to bowel dysfunction. Additionally, hearing loss is not as common as in type 2. Rarely, cleft lip has been reported in this form of Waardenburg syndrome.

Type 4 can also be caused by a mutation in &quot;SOX10&quot; (the same gene as in type 2E), in which it is known as type 4C; hearing loss is very common and severe in this type.

=== PCWH ===
A mutation in &quot;SOX10&quot;, the gene involved in type 2E and type 4C, can sometimes result in the symptoms of both types (neurological symptoms, as sometimes seen in type 2E, and Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease, as seen in type 4). When this happens, it is called peripheral demyelinating neuropathy–central dysmyelinating leukodystrophy–Waardenburg syndrome–Hirschsprung disease (PCWH).

== Cause ==


Waardenburg syndrome is caused by mutations in any of several genes that affect the operation of neural crest cells in embryonic development. Most types of Waardenburg syndrome are caused by autosomal dominant mutations. The few that are autosomal recessive are rare. In most cases, an affected person has inherited it from one parent with one of the dominant forms of the condition. A small percentage of cases result from spontaneous new mutations in the gene, where no family history of the condition exists.

The neural crest is a group of temporary migratory cells that are left over after the neural tube has closed (neurulation), around the fourth week of embryonic development. They are responsible for differentiating into a diverse group of cells that reach different areas of the body. The neural tube and neural crest are derived from the ectoderm; the neural tube goes on to form the brain and spinal cord, while the neural crest cells eventually go on to form various bones and cartilage of the skull and face by migrating through the pharyngeal arches. They also differentiate into the stria vascularis of the cochlea, the nerves and glia of the intestines (myenteric plexus), Schwann cells, which myelinate the peripheral nervous system to allow sufficient conductivity, odontoblasts, which produce dentin deep in the teeth, some neuroendocrine cells, connective tissue around the salivary, lacrimal, pituitary, thymus and thyroid glands, connective tissue of the eye, such as the stroma of the iris and cornea and the trabecular meshwork, and melanocytes, including those in the stroma of the iris that give rise to brown eye colour through melanin. Neural crest cells also have a role in muscle formation, including the wall muscle of certain cardiac arteries.

=== Causes of subtypes ===
* Type 1 is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the gene &quot;PAX3&quot;. PAX3, or paired box 3, is a transcription factor that has a role in maintaining an open window of time for certain neural crest cells (such as those of the head and eyes) to divide and migrate before their terminal differentiation (i.e. to maintain them in the stem-cell state). Mutations in this gene therefore prematurely arrest their division and migration, resulting in a minor lack of development of certain face cartilage and bones, as well as underdeveloped inner-ear structures and a lack of melanocytes in the iris stroma. Some evidence shows that PAX3 also regulates cells from before the neural crest forms, i.e. the neural tube, since mice with loss-of-function mutations in one of the copies of &quot;PAX3&quot; have neural tube defects such as spina bifida or exencephaly.
* Type 2 is caused by a mutation in any of a range of genes, the most common being &quot;MITF&quot;, when it is classed as type 2A.
** Type 2A is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the gene &quot;MITF&quot;. MITF, or microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, has a more specialised role in the neural crest and is more strictly involved after the neural crest forms (PAX3 and SOX10 have been found to activate &quot;MITF&quot;). It is known to allow melanocytes, osteoclasts, mast cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells to divide and migrate. The involvement in osteoclasts explains why mutations in both copies of &quot;MITF&quot; can lead to bone hardening (osteopetrosis), as the osteoclasts are responsible for breaking down bone. &quot;MITF&quot; also activates transcription of tyrosinase, the enzyme that performs the first step in the creation of melanin (oxidising tyrosine). A mutation in a copy of &quot;MITF&quot; can also lead to Tietz syndrome, which is distinguished from Waardenburg syndrome by uniform albinism instead of patchy depigmentation.
** Type 2B is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in an unknown gene on chromosome 1 in the locus range of 1p21–1p13.3. The gene has been provisionally termed &quot;WS2B&quot;.
** Type 2C is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in an unknown gene on chromosome 8 in the locus of 8p23. The gene has been provisionally termed &quot;WS2C&quot;.
** Type 2D is caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in both copies of the gene &quot;SNAI2&quot;. The study that discovered this association found that &quot;SNAI2&quot; is activated by &quot;MITF&quot; as part of neural crest development, and this explained why mutations in &quot;MITF&quot; cause Waardenburg syndrome, as it results in a lack of activation of &quot;SNAI2&quot;. Mutations in a single copy of &quot;SNAI2&quot; have also been found to cause patches of hair depigmentation (piebaldism) without any other symptoms.
** Type 2E is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the gene &quot;SOX10&quot;.
** Rarely, a mutation in a gene other than those currently known may be responsible for a Waardenburg syndrome with features of type 2. This is usually initially classified as simply type 2 but may be given its own subtype once a gene or locus is identified and established.
* Type 3 is caused by a mutation in the gene &quot;PAX3&quot;, the same gene as in type 1. It can be inherited in an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive manner; it is possible for two parents with Waardenburg syndrome type 1 to have a child carrying both mutated copies of the &quot;PAX3&quot; gene (25% chance) and present with Waardenburg syndrome type 3. A missense mutation has been documented to have this effect. However, it is also possible for Waardenburg syndrome type 3 to present spontaneously with just one mutated copy of &quot;PAX3&quot;. A deletion of the paired domain region of the gene has been documented to have this effect. However, no major correlation has been found between type of mutation and disease severity. Severity tends to be dictated by mutations in other genes (epistasis), as evidenced by distinct familial patterns in severity not tied to Waardenburg mutation type. Mutations in both copies of &quot;PAX3&quot; have sometimes led to death before or shortly after birth, and mice with loss-of-function mutations in both copies of the gene do not survive.
* Type 4 is caused by a mutation in any of a range of genes, the most common being &quot;SOX10&quot;, when it is classed as type 4C.
** Type 4A is caused by an autosomal dominant or autosomal-recessive mutation in the gene &quot;EDNRB&quot;.
** Type 4B is caused by an autosomal dominant or autosomal-recessive mutation in the gene &quot;EDN3&quot;.
** Type 4C is caused by an autosomal dominant or autosomal-recessive mutation in the gene &quot;SOX10&quot;, the same gene as in type 2E.

A study was done on a rare case of a double heterozygous child with each parent having only single mutations in &quot;MITF&quot; or &quot;PAX3&quot;. The effect of double heterozygous mutations in the genes &quot;MITF&quot; and &quot;PAX3&quot; in WS1 and WS2 can increase the pigment-affected symptoms. It leads to the conclusion that the double mutation of &quot;MITF&quot; is associated with the extremity of Waardenburg syndrome and may affect the phenotypes or symptoms of the syndrome.

=== Classification table ===
== Treatment ==
There is currently no treatment or cure for Waardenburg syndrome. The symptom most likely to be of practical importance is deafness, and this is treated as any other irreversible deafness would be. In marked cases, there may be cosmetic issues. Other abnormalities (neurological, structural, Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease) associated with the syndrome are treated symptomatically.

== Epidemiology ==
The prevalence of all types of Waardenburg syndrome is estimated at 1 in 42,000. Types 1 and 2 are by far the most common, with type 1 appearing to be slightly more common. In a 2015 review looking at 417 patients, type 1 was found to be the most common type, encompassing around half of all cases (47%), while type 2 was the second-most common type, encompassing around a third (33%). The vast majority (around 85%) of type 2 cases are type 2A. The prevalence of type 2B is unknown, as it was only reported in one 1996 study. Type 2C has so far only been found in one Italian family, and type 2D had only been found in 2 unrelated patients . The number of known cases of type 2E that involved neurological abnormalities was reported to be 23 , while the number of the rest is unknown. Type 3 is rarer than types 1, 2 and 4, comprising less than 2% of cases. Type 4 appears to encompass around a fifth of cases (19%). Of its subtypes, type 4C is by far the most common (about 71% of type 4), followed by type 4A (19%) and type 4B (10%).

It is estimated that Waardenburg syndrome is present in 2–5% of congenitally deaf people. Congenital deafness comprises around half of deafness as a whole. About 1 in 30 students in schools for the deaf have Waardenburg syndrome. The variable presentation of the syndrome makes it difficult to arrive at precise figures for its prevalence.

== History ==

=== Early descriptions ===
In 1916, Dutch ophthalmologist Jan van der Hoeve (1878–1952) described a pair of twin girls with deafness and a particular type of blepharophimosis, believed to be the dystopia canthorum found in Waardenburg syndrome types 1 and 3. Blepharophimosis describes eyelids which are underdeveloped such that they permanently cover part of the eyes.

In 1926, German physician Irmgard Mende described a family of four generations in which five children had symptoms of depigmentation of hair, skin and eyes, deafness and a &quot;mongoloid&quot; appearance. (Waardenburg later attributed this description to the dystopia canthorum.) This later led to the synonym Mende syndrome being recorded in some databases.

In 1929, Dutch physician K. T. A. Halbertsma described a familial pattern to dystopia canthorum, and in 1930, Italian physician Vincenzo Gualdi (1891–1976) also confirmed a hereditary pattern to dystopia canthorum. This later led to the synonym Van der Hoeve–Halbertsma–Waardenburg–Gualdi syndrome being recorded in some databases.

In 1947, Swiss ophthalmologist David Klein (1908–1993) first reported a patient with bilateral deafness, pigmentation deficiencies, characteristic facial features and malformation of the arms. Although this was the first full description of a patient with Waardenburg syndrome type 3, contemporary clinicians did not consider the syndrome he described to be the same as that described by Waardenburg four years later, in part due to how severe the arm malformations were in his patient.

The syndrome was first fully formalised and described by Dutch ophthalmologist and geneticist Petrus Johannes Waardenburg (1886–1979) in 1951. The condition he described is now categorised as Waardenburg syndrome type 1.

=== Descriptions of subtypes ===
Type 2 was first established in 1971 when a study noticed that some Waardenburg syndrome patients did not have dystopia canthorum. A 1977 study confirmed a familial pattern to this other presentation. Two 1994 studies first confirmed a link between this type of Waardenburg syndrome and mutations in the &quot;MITF&quot; gene (now classed as type 2A), located on chromosome 3 at locus 3p14.1–p12.3.

Type 2B was first established in 1994 when the same study which found mutations in &quot;MITF&quot; in patients with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 also found that some patients did not have any mutations in this region. A second 1994 study found a link to chromosome 1 in the locus 1p21–p13.3. This became known as type 2B of the condition (with the gene designated &quot;WS2B&quot;), however it has not been documented since, and the gene responsible remains unknown.

Type 2C was established in 2001 when a study of an Italian family with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 features found that they were due to an unknown gene on chromosome 8 at locus 8q23 that had been broken by a chromosomal translocation. The study established a provisional name for the gene, &quot;WS2C&quot;. However, mutations in this region in Waardenburg syndrome patients have not been found since.

Type 2D was established in 2002 when a study looking to find mutations in the human version of the &quot;SNAI2&quot; gene, known to cause depigmentation in mice, found deletions of both copies of this gene in two unrelated individuals with Waardenburg syndrome type 2. Mutations in both copies of this gene have not been found in those with Waardenburg syndrome type 2 since.

Type 2E was first established in 1996 when a study identified a girl with symptoms of Waardenburg syndrome type 2 but with additional underdevelopment of the front of the eye, leading to blindness. In 1999, it was found that she had a mutation in her &quot;SOX10&quot; gene, and later studies confirmed the association between mutations in this gene and this phenotype, as well as neurological symptoms such as developmental delay.

Type 3 was first given its name by Goodman &quot;et al.&quot; in 1981, in collaboration with Klein, in which they established the association with arm abnormalities first reported by Klein in 1947. Mutations in &quot;PAX3&quot; were first linked to this phenotype in 1992.

The comorbidity with Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease, which would later constitute type 4, was first noticed in various studies in the 1970s. Indian paediatrician Krishnakumar Shah and his associates first outlined the syndrome as a possible variant of Waardenburg syndrome in 1981. The variant was first attributed to a mutation in &quot;EDNRB&quot; in 1994 (now classed as type 4A). Type 4B was established in 1996 when mutations in &quot;EDN3&quot; were found to lead to this type of Waardenburg syndrome, and type 4C was first established in 1998 when mutations in &quot;SOX10&quot; were also found to lead to this type.

==Society and culture==
=== Popular culture ===
* The 2001 novel &quot;Shock&quot; by Robin Cook mentions a character with the disorder.
* Enzo MacLeod, protagonist of Peter May&#x27;s 2006–2017 book series &quot;The Enzo Files&quot;, has Waardenburg syndrome. His eyes are different colors, and he has a white streak in his hair.
* In the 2011 season 6 episode of &quot;Bones&quot; &quot;The Signs in the Silence&quot;, the team must solve a case in which the suspected killer has Waardenburg syndrome.
* The 2013 book &quot;Reconstructing Amelia&quot; by Kimberly McCreight features several characters with Waardenburg symptoms.
* The 2014 book &quot;Closer Than You Think&quot; by Karen Rose features three characters, siblings, with Waardenburg syndrome.

== Other animals ==
Waardenburg syndrome type 2A (with a mutation in &quot;MITF&quot;) has been found in dogs, Fleckvieh cattle, minks, mice and a golden hamster. Degeneration of the cochlea and saccule, as seen in Waardenburg syndrome, has also been found in deaf white cats, Dalmatians and other dog breeds, white minks and mice.

Domesticated cats with blue eyes and white coats are often completely deaf. Deafness is far more common in white cats than in those with other coat colors. According to the ASPCA &quot;Complete Guide to Cats&quot;, &quot;17 to 20 percent of white cats with non-blue eyes are deaf; 40 percent of &quot;odd-eyed&quot; white cats with one blue eye are deaf; and 65 to 85 percent of blue-eyed white cats are deaf.&quot; Although few studies have been done to link this to genes known to be involved in human Waardenburg syndrome, a genetic disruption to neural crest development would lead to this presentation in cats as well. One of the genes that leads to deafness and a white coat in cats when mutated, &quot;KIT&quot;, has been found to increase &quot;MITF&quot; expression.

Lethal white syndrome is a syndrome in horses caused by mutations in both copies of &quot;EDNRB&quot;. It leads to death from intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease. A mutation in a single copy of &quot;EDNRB&quot;, however, as in Waardenburg syndrome type 4A, produces the patchy white overo coat with deafness.

Ferrets with Waardenburg syndrome have a small white stripe along the top or back of the head and sometimes down the back of the neck (known as a &quot;blaze&quot; coat pattern), or a solid-white head from nose to shoulders (known as a &quot;panda&quot; coat pattern). Affected ferrets often have a very slightly flatter skull and wider-set eyes than healthy ferrets. As healthy ferrets have poor hearing, deafness may only be detected by lack of reaction to loud noises. As this is an inherited disorder, affected animals should not be used for breeding. A study of the correlation between coat variations and deafness in European ferrets found, &quot;All (n=27) panda, American panda, and blaze ferrets were deaf.&quot;

<text>Biochemical engineering, also known as bioprocess engineering, is a field of study with roots stemming from chemical engineering and biological engineering. It mainly deals with the design, construction, and advancement of unit processes that involve biological organisms (such as fermentation) or organic molecules (often enzymes) and has various applications in areas of interest such as biofuels, food, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and water treatment processes. The role of a biochemical engineer is to take findings developed by biologists and chemists in a laboratory and translate that to a large-scale manufacturing process.

== History ==

For hundreds of years, humans have made use of the chemical reactions of biological organisms in order to create goods. In the mid-1800s, Louis Pasteur was one of the first people to look into the role of these organisms when he researched fermentation. His work also contributed to the use of pasteurization, which is still used to this day. By the early 1900s, the use of microorganisms had expanded, and was used to make industrial products. Up to this point, biochemical engineering hadn&#x27;t developed as a field yet. It wasn&#x27;t until 1928 when Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin that the field of biochemical engineering was established. After this discovery, samples were gathered from around the world in order to continue research into the characteristics of microbes from places such as soils, gardens, forests, rivers, and streams. Today, biochemical engineers can be found working in a variety of industries, from food to pharmaceuticals. This is due to the increasing need for efficiency and production which requires knowledge of how biological systems and chemical reactions interact with each other and how they can be used to meet these needs.

== Applications ==
=== Biotechnology ===
Biotechnology and biochemical engineering are closely related to each other as biochemical engineering can be considered a sub-branch of biotechnology. One of the primary focuses of biotechnology is in the medical field, where biochemical engineers work to design pharmaceuticals, artificial organs, biomedical devices, chemical sensors, and drug delivery systems. Biochemical engineers use their knowledge of chemical processes in biological systems in order to create tangible products that improve people&#x27;s health. Specific areas of studies include metabolic, enzyme, and tissue engineering. The study of cell cultures is widely used in biochemical engineering and biotechnology due to its many applications in developing natural fuels, improving the efficiency in producing drugs and pharmaceutical processes, and also creating cures for disease. Other medical applications of biochemical engineering within biotechnology are genetics testing and pharmacogenomics.

=== Food Industry ===
Biochemical engineers primarily focus on designing systems that will improve the production, processing, packaging, storage, and distribution of food. Some commonly processed foods include wheat, fruits, and milk which undergo processes such as milling, dehydration, and pasteurization in order to become products that can be sold. There are three levels of food processing: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary food processing involves turning agricultural products into other products that can be turned into food, secondary food processing is the making of food from readily available ingredients, and tertiary food processing is commercial production of ready-to eat or heat-and-serve foods. Drying, pickling, salting, and fermenting foods were some of the oldest food processing techniques used to preserve food by preventing yeasts, molds, and bacteria to cause spoiling. Methods for preserving food have evolved to meet current standards of food safety but still use the same processes as the past. Biochemical engineers also work to improve the nutritional value of food products, such as in golden rice, which was developed to prevent vitamin A deficiency in certain areas where this was an issue. Efforts to advance preserving technologies can also ensure lasting retention of nutrients as foods are stored. Packaging plays a key role in preserving as well as ensuring the safety of the food by protecting the product from contamination, physical damage, and tampering. Packaging can also make it easier to transport and serve food. A common job for biochemical engineers working in the food industry is to design ways to perform all these processes on a large scale in order to meet the demands of the population. Responsibilities for this career path include designing and performing experiments, optimizing processes, consulting with groups to develop new technologies, and preparing project plans for equipment and facilities.

=== Pharmaceuticals ===

In the pharmaceutical industry, bioprocess engineering plays a crucial role in the large-scale production of biopharmaceuticals, such as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, and therapeutic proteins. The development and optimization of bioreactors and fermentation systems are essential for the mass production of these products, ensuring consistent quality and high yields. For example, recombinant proteins like insulin and erythropoietin are produced through cell culture systems using genetically modified cells. The bioprocess engineer’s role is to optimize variables like temperature, pH, nutrient availability, and oxygen levels to maximize the efficiency of these systems. The growing field of gene therapy also relies on bioprocessing techniques to produce viral vectors, which are used to deliver therapeutic genes to patients. This involves scaling up processes from laboratory to industrial scale while maintaining safety and regulatory compliance. As the demand for biopharmaceutical products increases, advancements in bioprocess engineering continue to enable more sustainable and cost-effective manufacturing methods.

<text>Louis Eugène Roy (; 1861 – 27 October 1939) was a prominent mulatto Haitian banker selected by U.S. General John H. Russell, Jr., the American High Commissioner to Haïti, to serve as that country&#x27;s interim president following the resignation of Louis Borno. Roy served from 15 May to 18 November 1930, during which time his major duty was to oversee elections to the new National Assembly during the United States occupation of Haiti. When the Assembly selected Sténio Vincent as president, Roy stepped down.

<text>The Great Glen ( ), also known as Glen Albyn (from the Gaelic &quot;Glen of Scotland&quot; ) or Glen More (from the Gaelic &quot;Big/Great Glen&quot;), is a glen in Scotland running for from Inverness on the edge of the Moray Firth, in an approximately straight line to Fort William at the head of Loch Linnhe. It follows a geological fault known as the Great Glen Fault, and bisects the Scottish Highlands into the Grampian Mountains to the southeast and the Northwest Highlands to the northwest.
The glen is a natural travelling route in the Highlands of Scotland, which is used by both the Caledonian Canal and the A82 road, which link the city of Inverness on the northeast coast with Fort William on the west coast. The Invergarry and Fort Augustus Railway was built in 1896 from the southern end of the glen to the southern end of Loch Ness, but was never extended to Inverness. The railway closed in 1947. In 2002, the Great Glen Way was opened. A long-distance route for cyclists, canoeists, and walkers, it consists of a series of footpaths, forestry tracks, canal paths and occasional stretches of road linking Fort William to Inverness.

The glen&#x27;s strategic importance in controlling the Highland Scottish clans, particularly around the time of the Jacobite risings of the 18th century, is recognised by the presence of the towns of Fort William in the south, Fort Augustus in the middle of the glen, and Fort George, just to the northeast of Inverness.

Much of the glen is taken up with a series of lochs, with rivers connecting them. The Caledonian Canal also uses the lochs as part of the route, but the rivers are not navigable. From northeast to southwest, the natural water features along the Great Glen are:
* River Ness ()
* Loch Dochfour ()
* Loch Ness ()
* River Oich ()
* Loch Oich ()
* Loch Lochy ()
* River Lochy ()
* Loch Linnhe ()

The watershed lies between Loch Oich and Loch Lochy. Loch Linnhe to the south of Fort William is a sea loch into which both the River Lochy and Caledonian Canal emerge. At the north end, the River Ness empties into the Beauly Firth at the point where it meets the Moray Firth.

==Seismic activity==
Although earthquakes in the vicinity of the Great Glen Fault tend to be minor, seismic activity is a consideration in the design of infrastructure. For example, the Kessock Bridge includes seismic buffers.

<doc id="616681" wikidata="Q1154605" url="?curid=616681" title="Rush Hour (puzzle)">
<text>Rush Hour is a sliding block puzzle invented by Nob Yoshigahara in the 1970s. It was first sold in the United States in 1996. It is now being manufactured by ThinkFun (formerly Binary Arts).

ThinkFun now sells &quot;Rush Hour&quot; spin-offs &quot;Rush Hour Jr.&quot;, &quot;Safari Rush Hour&quot;, &quot;Railroad Rush Hour&quot;, &quot;Rush Hour Brain Fitness&quot; and &quot;Rush Hour Shift&quot;, with puzzles by Scott Kim. The game sold more than 1 million units.

==Game==
The board is a 6×6 grid with grooves in the tiles to allow cars to slide, card tray to hold the cards, current active card holder and an exit hole. The game comes with 16 vehicles (12 cars, 4 trucks), each colored differently, and 40 puzzle cards. Cars and trucks are both one square wide, but cars are two squares long and trucks are three squares long. Vehicles can only be moved along a straight line on the grid; rotation is forbidden. Puzzle cards, each with a level number that indicates the difficulty of the challenge, show the starting positions of cars and trucks. Not all cars and trucks are used in all challenges.

===Objective===
The goal of the game is to get only the red car out through the exit of the board by moving the other vehicles out of its way. However, the cars and trucks (set up before play, according to a puzzle card) obstruct the path of both the red car and each other, which makes the puzzle even more difficult.

===Editions===
The Regular Edition comes with forty puzzles split into four different difficulties, ranging from Beginner to Expert. The Deluxe Edition has a black playing board, card box in place of the Regular Edition&#x27;s card tray, and sixty new puzzles with an extra difficulty: the Grand Master. The Ultimate Collector&#x27;s Edition has a playing board that can hold vehicles not in play and can display the active card in a billboard-like display. The Ultimate Collectors Edition also includes 155 new puzzles (with some of them being from card set three) and a white limo. In 2011, the board was changed to black, like the Deluxe Edition.

An iOS version of the game was released in 2010.

===Expansions===
Three official expansions, called &quot;add-on packs&quot;, were released: Card Set 2, which comes with a red sports car that takes up 2 squares; Card Set 3, which comes with a white limo that takes up 3 squares; and Card Set 4, which comes with a taxi that takes up 2 squares. Each set also comes with 40 new exclusive challenges—from Intermediate to Grand Master—that make use of the new vehicles in place of (or in addition to) the red car. All three of the expansion packs will work with all editions of the game. Also, like the Regular Edition of the game in 2011, the cards of all three expansions were changed to have new levels and design to match the new board color of the Regular Edition.

==Computational complexity on larger boards==

When generalized so that it can be played on an arbitrarily large board, the problem of deciding if a &quot;Rush Hour&quot; problem has a solution is PSPACE-complete. This is proved by reducing a graph game called nondeterministic constraint logic, which is known to be PSPACE-complete, to generalized Rush Hour positions. In 2005, Tromp and Cilibrasi showed that &quot;Rush Hour&quot; is still PSPACE-complete when the cars are of size 2 only. They also conjectured that &quot;Rush Hour&quot; is still nontrivial when the cars are of size 1 only.

==Most difficult configurations==
The hardest possible initial configuration has been shown to take 93 steps. A shortest solution can be seen on the right.
If you count the necessary moves instead of the steps, the most difficult start configuration in this sense requires 51 moves.

<text>Bahurim (etymology uncertain) was a village mentioned in the Hebrew Bible east of Jerusalem, on the road to the Jordan valley, close to the Mount of Olives.

==Biblical references==
Bahurim is the place where Palti, son of Laish turned back as he cried after his wife, Michal, when she was brought back to her first husband, King David.

It is also mentioned during David&#x27;s flight from Absalom:

:When King David came to Bahurim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; and as he came he cursed continually. And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. And Shimei said as he cursed, &quot;Begone, begone, you man of blood, you worthless fellow! The Lord has avenged upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and The Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your ruin is on you; for you are a man of blood.&quot; -- ( RSV)

Here also the Cohanim Jonathan and Ahimaaz hid themselves ().

Azmaveth, one of David&#x27;s heroes, is also mentioned as a native of Bahurim (; ).

==Identification==
A Jewish tradition in the Targum identifies Bahurim with &quot;Almon&quot; (), later called &quot;Almît&quot;, about 4 miles N.E. of Jerusalem, and a mile beyond Anathoth (Anâta). It has also been identified with &quot;Râs et-Tumein&quot;, north-east of the Mount of Olives. &quot;Râs et-Tumein&quot; is located at 1744.1333 (Palestine grid coordinates). However, it seems to be more likely that Bahurim was located at a place known as &quot;Barruka&quot;, located at 1750.1318 (Palestine grid coordinates) which disengages Ras et Tmim for the identification with Nob.

French archaeologist and historical geographer, Victor Guérin, identified the site Bahurim with Abu Dis, a village 3 km, south-east of Jerusalem, before the suburbs of Jerusalem began to expand. The village, he argues, underwent a metamorphosis in name change; the name evolving from &quot;Būrīs&quot;, or &quot;Wadīs&quot; by another account, to what it is today. According to Zohar Amar, the name can be traced back, etymologically, to its earlier Greek pronunciation &quot;Baoureis&quot; (&quot;Baoureim&quot;) (with the absence of the voiceless pharyngeal fricative &quot;chet&quot;, which has a slight aspirated sound in Hebrew, but does not exist in Greek pronunciation).

<text>Borage ( or ; Borago officinalis), also known as starflower, is an annual herb in the flowering plant family Boraginaceae native to the Mediterranean region. Although the plant contains small amounts of pyrrolizidine alkaloids, some parts are edible and its seeds provide oil.

==Description==
&quot;B. officinalis&quot; grows to a height of , and is bristly or hairy all over the stems and leaves; the leaves are alternate, simple, and long.

The flowers are complete, perfect with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. Flowers are most often blue, although pink flowers are sometimes observed. White-flowered types are also cultivated. The blue flower is genetically dominant over the white flower.

The flowers arise along scorpioid cymes to form large floral displays with multiple flowers blooming simultaneously, suggesting that borage has a high degree of geitonogamy (intraplant pollination).

It has an indeterminate growth habit. In temperate climates such as in the UK, its flowering season is relatively long, from June to September. In milder climates, borage blooms continuously for most of the year. It can be invasive.

=== Chemistry ===
The seeds consist of 26–38% borage seed oil, of which 17–28% is gamma-linolenic acid (GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid), making borage seed oil the richest known source of GLA. The oil also contains the fatty acids palmitic acid (10–11%), stearic acid (3.5–4.5%), oleic acid (16–20%), linoleic acid (35–38%), eicosenoic acid (3.5–5.5%), erucic acid (1.5–3.5%), and nervonic acid (1.5%). Healthy adults typically produce ample GLA from dietary linoleic acid, but borage seed oil is often marketed as a GLA supplement, under the names &quot;starflower oil&quot; or &quot;borage oil&quot;.

The leaves contain small amounts (2–10 ppm in the dried herb) of the liver-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) intermedine, lycopsamine, amabiline, and supinine and the nontoxic saturated PA thesinine. PAs are also present in borage seed oil, but may be removed by processing.

== Distribution and habitat ==
It is native to the Mediterranean region, and has naturalized in many other locales. It grows satisfactorily in gardens in most of Europe, such as Denmark, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. It is not a perennial, but it remains in the garden from year to year by self-seeding.

== Toxicity ==
In addition to the liver-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids found in the leaves and seed oil, the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment has advised that honey from borage contains PAs, transferred to the honey through pollen collected at borage plants, and advise that commercial honey production could select for raw honey with limited PA content to prevent contamination.

== Uses ==

Traditionally, borage was cultivated for culinary and medicinal uses, although today, commercial cultivation is mainly as an oilseed.
Borage is used as either a fresh vegetable or a dried herb. As a fresh vegetable, borage, with a cucumber-like taste, is often used in salads or as a garnish.

The flower has a sweet, honey-like taste and is often used to decorate desserts and cocktails, sometimes frozen in ice cubes.

Vegetable use of borage is common in Germany, in the Spanish regions of Aragón and Navarre, on the Greek island of Crete, and in the northern Italian region of Liguria.

Although often used in soups, one of the better known German borage recipes is the Frankfurt speciality &quot;grüne Soße&quot; (&quot;green sauce&quot;).

In Liguria, Italy, borage (in Italian, &quot;borragine&quot;) is commonly used as a filling of the traditional pasta ravioli and pansoti.

It is used to flavour pickled gherkins in Poland and Russia.

The flowers produce copious nectar which is used by honeybees to make a light and delicate honey.
===Beverage=== 
Borage is traditionally used as a garnish in the Pimms Cup cocktail, but is nowadays often replaced by a long sliver of cucumber peel or by mint. It is also one of the key botanicals in Gilpin&#x27;s Westmorland Extra Dry Gin. The author of &quot;Cups and their Customs&quot; notes that a sprig or two of borage &quot;communicates a peculiar refreshing flavour&quot; to any cool drink.

In Persian cuisine, borage tea (using the dried purple flowers) is called گل گاوزبان : &quot;gol gâvzabân&quot;, &quot;cow&#x27;s-tongue-flower&quot;.

=== Herbal medicine ===
Traditionally, &quot;Borago officinalis&quot; has been used in hyperactive gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, such as gastrointestinal (colic, cramps, diarrhea), airways (asthma, bronchitis), cardiovascular, (cardiotonic, antihypertensive and blood purifier), urinary (diuretic and kidney/bladder disorders).

One case of status epilepticus has been reported that was associated with borage oil ingestion.

A methanol extract of borage has shown strong amoebicidal activity &quot;in vitro&quot;. The 50% inhibitory concentration () of the extract against &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; was 33 μg/mLl.

=== Companion planting ===
Borage is used in companion planting. It is said to protect or nurse legumes, spinach, brassicas, and strawberries. It is also said to be a good companion plant to tomatoes because it confuses the mother moths of tomato hornworms or manduca looking for a place to lay their eggs. Claims that it improves tomato growth and makes them taste better remain unsubstantiated.

==In culture==
Pliny the Elder and Dioscorides said that borage was the nepenthe (νηπενθές : nēpenthés) mentioned in Homer, which caused forgetfulness when mixed with wine.

King Henry VIII&#x27;s last wife, Catherine Parr, used borage in a concoction to treat melancholy.

Francis Bacon thought that borage had &quot;an excellent spirit to repress the fuliginous vapour of dusky melancholie&quot;.

John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot; mentions an old verse concerning the plant: &quot;&quot;Ego Borago, Gaudia semper ago&quot; (I, Borage, bring always joys)&quot;. He asserts:
