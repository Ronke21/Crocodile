<text>Gorges State Park is a North Carolina state park in Transylvania County, North Carolina in the United States and along with other conservation lands is part of a 100,000+ acre conservation corridor stretching some 80 miles along the NC/SC state line. The land, along Jocassee Gorges, was purchased by the state from Duke Energy Corporation in 1999. It is North Carolina&#x27;s westernmost state park and one of the state&#x27;s newest. The park is adjacent to part of the Pisgah National Forest and the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission&#x27;s Toxaway Game Land. Gorges State Park provides the principal access to the Horsepasture River on these adjoining public lands.

==History==

The land of Gorges State Park is a thriving second growth forest. It has recovered from the interference of man to provide a thriving and unique habitat.

One of the most damaging interferences to the Gorges environment occurred in 1916 when the dam containing Lake Toxaway broke. Record amounts of water gushed southward down the Toxaway River, destroying the communities in its path, scouring the gorges and leaving piles of debris 15 to high.

Following the flood, local citizens eventually sold large land tracts in the Gorges to Singer Sewing Machine Company, which logged most of the land. Then, in the 1940s and 1950s, Singer sold the land to Duke Energy Corporation. The corporation purchased the land for its steep topography and high rainfall, which offered opportunities for development of hydropower projects.

Conservation studies, in Jocassee Gorge, began in the late 1970s. In the late 1990s, Duke Energy decided that it no longer needed large portions of the Gorges for future hydropower and offered the land for sale to natural resources agencies in North and South Carolina. The NC Division of Parks and Recreation stepped up to create, with the support of local citizens and the North Carolina General Assembly, one of the newest state parks in 1999.

==Recreation==
Gorges State Park is open for year-round recreation, including, camping, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing. Primitive camping is available in several different natural environments. The Ray Fisher Place campground was closed in 2020 and a new campground with 16 tent sites, 13 RV sites and 5 Camper Cabins was opened in November 2022. Each RV site has sewer and electrical hookups and all sites have a fire ring, picnic table and lantern hook. It was a hike-in campground with six primitive campsites, each with a picnic table, fire ring and lantern hook, and it was a hike from the Rainbow Falls Trail-head. Another camping area is near the shores of Lake Jocassee, along the Foothills Trail. These campsites are also primitive and hike-in. Dispersed camping is also permitted in the adjoining Pisgah National Forest, and backpackers may register and leave their vehicles in the park. Lake Jocassee is a deep man made lake which forms much of the park&#x27;s southern boundary, and it is open to trout and bass fishing. The streams of Gorges State Park are all designated Wild Trout Waters. Many miles of trails are open to hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding.

The Grassy Ridge Access off North Carolina Highway 281 in Sapphire is the park&#x27;s primary access. This area is most well known for providing the principle access to Rainbow Falls and Turtleback Falls on the Horsepasture River. These falls are in the Pisgah National Forest, but it is not uncommon for visitors to mistakenly think the falls are inside the park because the park provides the only easy, legal access to them. Upper Bearwallow Falls is located in the access area, and it currently is the only waterfall in the park with a maintained trail leading to it.

The Frozen Creek Access off Frozen Creek Road in Rosman is the park&#x27;s secondary access, and the park&#x27;s longest trails are reached from it. Both the Auger Hole and Cane Break trails start at the access, and they end at different points along the Foothills Trail. The Auger Hole Trail is the park&#x27;s only multi-use trail and it is open to hikers, horse-back riders, and mountain bicyclists.

==Temperate Rainforest==

The average yearly rainfall at Gorges State Park is between 90-100 inches creating a temperate rainforest. The rainfall is a result of orographic lift which occurs when an air mass is forced from a low elevation to a higher elevation as it moves over rising terrain. The land at Gorges State Park rises over in just . As the air mass gains altitude it expands and cools adiabatically. This cooler air cannot hold the moisture as well as warm air can, which effectively raises the relative humidity to 100%, creating clouds and frequent precipitation.

==Ecology==
Gorges State Park is home to a wide variety of habitats due to its differing geologic formations, elevation, and climate. It is located between the Tennessee Valley/Gulf of Mexico and the Savannah River/Atlantic Ocean drainage basins. Five streams flowing through Gorges State Park carry water over the Blue Ridge Escarpment, gradually at first, before plummeting over waterfalls into a series of gorges.

Gorges State Park is home to roughly 125 rare plant and animal species and 12 endangered or threatened plant and animal species. Many of these rare plants species would typically be found only in the tropic regions of the world. Scientists are unsure of how these plants, including Pringle&#x27;s aquatic moss and Carolina star-moss, have come to grow in the Appalachian Mountains far from their usual homes. Some scientists believe that spores blew in from the tropics. Others think that the species have remained from a time period when the surrounding area was much warmer.

Gorges State Park is also home to an abundance of plant and wildlife that is more typical to the southern Appalachians. Plant species include, mountain laurel, rhododendron, white pine, red oak, and hickories. Oconee bells are very rare flowering plants are abundant in the gorges of the park. These flowers are endangered and populations of the plant have been found.

The most common animal species of Gorges State Park are white-tailed deer, black bear, wild turkey, coyote, fox, and wild boar. The park is also home to North Carolina&#x27;s largest known population of green salamanders. The rare Swainson&#x27;s warbler and three rare fish, the turquoise darter, rosyface chub and redeye bass are found in Gorges State Park as well.

<text>Hammocks Beach State Park is a North Carolina state park in Onslow County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Swansboro, along the Southern Outer Banks, or Crystal Coast, the state park covers and consists mainly of Bear Island. The park also owns three smaller islands, Dudley, Huggins and Jones, located in the nearby mouth of the White Oak River. After a recently completed deal, acres on the mainland were added to the park.

==Bear Island==
Bear Island is four miles long with a south-facing beach. It is characterized by an extensive dune system, a pocket of maritime forest, and a shrub thicket and marsh on the northern sound side, of the island. It is popular with daytrippers, boaters, kayakers and campers. While it serves a recreational function, with a new bathhouse and primitive camping sites, the vast majority of the island is wild and undisturbed. Most of the animals on Bear Island flew or swam through tidal creeks and marshes to make their home on the island. Fresh water is scarce and only found in a few ponds in the forest between some dunes. Recent hurricanes have had a considerable impact on the oceanfront beach/dune system.

A ferry service runs from the Hammocks Beach State Park headquarters on the mainland to Bear Island via Cow Channel. While the ride, which some 200,000 people a year take, is only 15 minutes long, it is narrow and winding. The channel has increasingly become more difficult to navigate at low tide since 1996 due to sand migration in the estuary and a series of hurricanes. Shoaling in the channel has been constant since ferry operations began in the early 1960s and has worsened in recent years due to hurricane activity, particularly in the half-mile stretch of the channel nearest the island. During low tides, the park has used 11-passenger skiffs to ferry passengers rather than its , 28-passenger boats. The ferry service was temporarily curtailed in 2002 because at low tide, the water was &quot;extremely low&quot; in a section of the channel. It was shut down completely for several months in early 2007 for an emergency dredging project in the channel route to the island. As of 2009 Hammocks Beach State Park now offers a ferry that can hold up to 49 passengers.

In 1980, Bear Island was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

==Huggins Island==

Nearby Huggins Island, which sits just inland from Bear Island between it and the mainland, largely consists of a thick maritime forest with many large live oak trees. The island is mostly flat with no sand dunes and is about a quarter of the size of Bear Island. At the western end of the island, from which the town of Swansboro can be seen, is a large marsh. Huggins Island is only accessible by private boat, and there are no facilities, and camping is not permitted on this island.

An even smaller island near Huggins is known in the area for its collection of sharks teeth, which wash in with the tide on the eastern tip, giving it the name Sharks Tooth Island, but it is not part of Hammocks Beach State Park. Huggins Island became a part of Hammocks Beach State Park in 2000.

==Jones Island==

Jones Island lies seven miles northeast of Bear Island at the mouth of White Oak River. Prominently situated in the middle of the river about a mile off the town of Swansboro, Jones Island is the dominant landmass in the Lower White Oak. It is characterized by low upland rises at the southeast and northwest ends and its marshes and small ponds along its eastern shore. The northwestern third of the island supports coastal fringe evergreen forest, which is considered to be a rare coastal ecosystem type. Loblolly pine and live oak trees are prominent on the property and eastern painted bunting have been seen nesting on the island. Breeding populations of this sparrow-sized member of the finch family are rare in North Carolina. In October 2007, of the island permanently became part of Hammocks Beach State Park. The island, which is considered a regionally significant natural heritage area, was zoned for residential development and will now be protected for years to come.

==Dudley Island==
Dudley Island is located between Bear Island and Huggins Island. The island was offered to the state as a donation that will be completed in phases over a three-year period. The state accepted the first phase of the donation in December 2015.

==History==
Dugout canoes once traveled the vast coastal waterways as woodland Native Americans journeyed between the mainland and surrounding islands. These Native Americans participated in the Tuscarora wars against colonists in 1711 and 1713. Hostilities continued from hideouts around Bear Island until the middle of the 18th century when the Native Americans migrated northward. Dugout canoes soon gave way to pirate ships. The inlets along the coast and the shallow waterways behind the barrier islands were havens for pirates. Here they could prey upon merchant vessels and hide while repairing their ships. Among the pirates who frequented the area was the notorious Blackbeard. Spanish privateers also terrorized the colonists. For protection, the colonists built several forts, including one near Bear Inlet, which was erected in 1749 and has since disappeared.

Due to its location, Bear Island and Huggins Island have often played a role in the protection of the mainland. During the Civil War, Confederate troops on Bear Island defended it against Union forces occupying Bogue Banks. The island again assumed military importance nearly a century later when, during World War II, the Coast Guard used it to secure the coast and monitor German U-boat activity. Huggins Island also featured in the Civil War. Confederate Brigadier General Walter Gwynn, in charge of coastal defenses from New Bern to the South Carolina line, working with North Carolina Adjutant General Richard Gatlin, proposed to erect a six-gun battery on the southern tip of Huggins Island to protect Bogue Inlet. Construction of the fort was completed in December 1861 with labor supplied by local slaves working alongside the troops detailed for that purpose. Captain Daniel Munn&#x27;s company was then stationed at the fort to man the cannons for one year. They were then ordered to join General Lawrence Branch&#x27;s Brigade at New Bern and took the cannons with them as they marched out of Swansboro. Several of the cannons were captured by Union troops during the Battle of New Bern on March 14, 1862. On August 19, a Union force commanded by Colonel Thomas G. Stevenson of the 24th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry made a reconnaissance to Swansboro. During the expedition the fort at Huggins’ Island was burned, the barracks and ammunition magazine collapsing into ashes. Only the earthen embankment remains as evidence of the fort&#x27;s existence. Those earthworks, however, have dodged development and erosion, and are now the only unspoiled example of Confederate earthwork fortifications surviving on the North Carolina coast.

Early in the 20th century, Dr. William Sharpe, a neurosurgeon of New York, came to Bear Island to hunt. His love of the island prompted him to acquire it for his retirement. Sharpe intended to will the property to John Hurst, his longtime hunting guide and friend, but Hurst persuaded him to donate it to the North Carolina Teachers Association, an organization of African American teachers. In 1950, the group assumed the deed to Bear Island and attempted to develop the property. Limited funds and the island&#x27;s remoteness rendered their efforts unsuccessful. In 1961, the association donated the island to the state of North Carolina for a park. Initially planned as a park for minorities, Hammocks Beach State Park opened for all people following the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

<text>Hanging Rock State Park is a North Carolina state park in Stokes County, North Carolina in the United States. The park is north of Winston-Salem and is located approximately from Danbury in Stokes County.

==History==

On April 20, 1936, the &quot;Winston-Salem Foundation&quot; and the &quot;Stokes County Committee for Hanging Rock&quot; donated to North Carolina for establishing a state park. Prior to this, the land had been owned by developers intent on creating a mountain resort on its highest summit. The plans fell through when the developers went bankrupt during the initial construction. After the state acquired the property, the Civilian Conservation Corps built the original facilities between 1935 and 1942, including the construction of a lake and bathhouse that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Additional land acquisitions in the 1970s added to the park the Lower Cascades, a spectacular waterfall, and the Tory&#x27;s Den, a rock outcropping rumored to have served as a hideout for British Loyalists during the American Revolutionary War. Another large land purchase in 2000 added Flat Shoals Mountain, a smaller summit visible from the top of Hanging Rock, to the park.

==Location==

Hanging Rock State Park is located in the Sauratown Mountain Range, one of the most easterly mountain ranges in the state. Often called &quot;the mountains away from the mountains,&quot; the Sauratown range is made up of monadnocks that are separated from the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains. The Sauratown Mountains lie completely within the borders of Stokes and Surry counties. Prominent peaks in the Sauratown range rise from to more than in elevation and stand in bold contrast to the surrounding countryside, which averages only in elevation. The most well known peak in the range is Pilot Mountain in nearby Pilot Mountain State Park. The highest point in the park – and the highest point in the Sauratown Mountain range – is Moore&#x27;s Knob. It rises to 2,579 feet (786 m) above sea level.

Named for the Saura Native Americans who were early inhabitants of the region, the rocky tops of the Sauratown Mountains are the remnants of a once-broad layer of rock that covered the region. Over many years, wind, water and other forces eroded the surrounding blanket of rock. What remains of these ancient mountains is the erosion-resistant quartzite, which now supports scenic ridges and knobs, including Moore&#x27;s Knob, Moore&#x27;s Wall, Cook&#x27;s Wall, Devil&#x27;s Chimney, Wolf Rock and Hanging Rock.

==Ecology==

Due to its unique location, the park is home to a number of species of flora that are more commonly found in the westernmost part of the state. Carolina and Canadian hemlock grow alongside each other, and in the spring visitors can view the colorful displays of rhododendron, mountain laurel, pinxter azalea, and a number of other wildflowers. Much of the park is an oak-hickory forest, with chestnut oak the dominant hardwood.

The park is also home to the rare Wehrle&#x27;s salamander, and peregrine falcons have been known to nest in the crags on the park&#x27;s high peaks. Ravens and vultures may be seen calling and circling overhead. Visitors might see white-tailed deer, wild turkey, and rarely American Black Bears while walking the park trails.

Two venomous snakes, the copperhead and timber rattlesnake, live in the park, but they do not bother unless provoked. All wildlife is protected at Hanging Rock just as in all other North Carolina State Parks.

==Activities==

Hanging Rock State Park offers over of trails where visitors can hike to its numerous peaks and waterfalls. The park has a 73-site tent and trailer campground (minus R/V hookups) and 10 vacation cabins for overnight accommodations. The lake and bathhouse, open from Memorial Day – Labor Day, offers swimming and boat rentals. Rock climbing is permitted at Moore&#x27;s Wall and Cook&#x27;s Wall but is not allowed at the Hanging Rock summit. The visitor center and museum room is open daily. There is no admission fee to the park.

The Mountains-to-Sea Trail pass through the park and joins with the Sauratown Trail.

==Waterfalls==

The park is the home to at least 5 significant waterfalls (listed in order of height):

*Tory&#x27;s Falls
*Upper Cascades
*Lower Cascades
*Window Falls
*Hidden Falls

<text>Jones Lake State Park is a North Carolina state park in Bladen County, North Carolina in the United States near Elizabethtown. It covers , including the Carolina bay lakes of Jones Lake and Salters Lake. Jones Lake State Park is north of Elizabethtown on North Carolina Highway 242 in North Carolina&#x27;s Coastal Plain region. The park offers year-round recreation, including fishing, swimming, boating, hiking, picnicking and environmental and historical education programs.

==Geology==
Jones Lake is one of a series of Carolina Bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Recent work by the U.S. Geological Survey has interpreted the Carolina Bays as relict thermokarst lakes that formed several thousands of years ago when the climate was colder, drier, and windier. Thermokarst lakes develop by thawing of frozen ground (permafrost) and by subsequent modification by wind and water. Thus, this interpretation suggests that permafrost once extended as far south as the Carolina Bays during the last ice age and (or) previous ice ages. Jones Lake is not fed by any stream but relies entirely upon rain. The land beneath and surrounding the lake is mica-rich sandy clay and sand that is from the Upper Cretaceous era with a thin layer of Pleistocene deposits covering it. This land is lower than the surrounding land and drains very poorly, creating Jones Lake.

==Human History==
The area surrounding Jones and Salters Lakes at Jones Lake State Park was settled by migrants for Europe in the late 1720s and early 1730s. Jones Lake was originally known as Woodward Lake a local justice of the peace. It was renamed Jones Lake for Isaac Jones a local land owner who donated the land on which Elizabethtown was built in 1773. Salters Lake is named for an American Revolutionary War heroine, Sallie Salter. Salter spied on Tories that were camped near Elizabethtown on the Cape Fear River.

The government of the state of North Carolina began to take an interest in Jones and Salters Lakes and other Carolina Bays in the 19th century. The North Carolina General Assembly blocked all further private claims on lakes. Soon after, the state assembly pass legislation that granted ownership of all lakes greater than 500 acres (2.02 km2) in Cumberland, Columbus and Bladen Counties to the state. The formation of Jones Lake, Lake Waccamaw and Singletary Lake State Parks can be traced back to this piece of legislation.

The growth of the cotton, turpentine and lumber industries in the area of Jones Lake State Park eventually was greater than what the soil could support. The fertility of the farmland was depleted and most of the standing timber had been clear cut from Bladen County. The land could no longer support the demands of the people living on the land. Farmers were no longer able to produce sustainable crops and many were forced to leave their farms.

The National Park Service began purchasing the land surrounding Jones and Salters Lakes in 1936 for a recreational demonstration project. Out of work young men were employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was established by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 during the Great Depression many of the facilities of Jones Lake State Park. The land was managed by the Resettlement Administration until 1939.

Jones Lake State Park was opened in 1939 during the segregation era as a state park for the use of African Americans. The black communities of southeastern North Carolina used Jones Lake State Park for family reunions, baptisms, and church picnics. A result of racial segregation of the state park systems was that the parks for blacks were left largely underfunded and thereby undeveloped. The area in and surrounded Jones Lake remains largely wild and undeveloped offering visitors a chance to see two Carolina Bays in a nearly natural state.

Jones Lake State Park, like Singletary Lake State Park just to the southeast, was used by soldiers training for World War II at nearby Camp Davis for special anti-craft training. The state park also received national attention in 1980 when astronomers gathered at the park to view a solar eclipse.

==Ecology==

Jones Lake is surrounded by a bay forest. This forest consists primarily of bay trees such as the loblolly, red bay, pond pine and Atlantic white cedar. The understory consists of huckleberry, leucothoe, gallberry and pepperbush. turkey oak, blueberry, holly and longleaf pine can be found at the higher elevations away from the shoreline.

The forests of Jones Lake State Park provide a habitat for a variety of animals that are fairly common to an eastern woodland habitat. Wild turkey, white-tailed deer and rabbits can be spotted on from time to time. Wood ducks live on the lake. Red-cockaded woodpeckers can be seen in the forest as can red-tailed hawks, yellow-throated warbler, white-eyed vireo and pileated woodpeckers. Jones Lake State Park is also home to box turtles, fence lizards, pine barrens tree frog, southern toads, bullfrogs and carpenter frogs.

This park is also the place where the type specimen of &quot;Phyllophaga nebulosa&quot;, a species of June beetle, was found and is currently the only known location for this species.

==Recreation==
Jones Lake State Park is open for year-round recreation, including camping, fishing, boating, hiking and environmental and historical education. Visitors to the park will find 20 campsites that are open for family camping. The sites are equipped with a picnic table and charcoal grill. Hot water showers are available at the park bath house. All campsites are available on a first come first served basis. The campground is closed November through February.

Jones Lake is open to recreational fishing and boating. All boats must be under . Canoes and paddleboats are available to rent at the boathouse Memorial Day through Labor Day. The waters of the lake have a high acidity level due to the amount of vegetation that is decomposing and the buildup peat on the lake bottom. The acid levels have limited the numbers of fish that inhabit Jones Lake and recreation fishing is in turn limited. Yellow perch, chain pickerel, and catfish can be caught from the shore, pier and boats.

Bay Lake Trail is a five-mile (8.05 km) hiking trail around Jones Lake. It passes through the forests that surround the lake. Side trails lead to the lake where visitors can observe pond cypress trees that are covered in Spanish moss. Bay Lake Trail begins at the picnic area and ends at the campground. A one-mile (0.6 km) nature trail, the Cedar Loop Trail, passes through the bay forest and over a sand ridge.

Swimming and picnicking are the two most popular recreational activities at Jones Lake State Park. The large picnic area is near the swimming beach. There are 50 picnic tables, eight grills and a large pavilion. The beach is open Memorial Day through Labor Day.

<text>Jordan Lake State Recreation Area is a North Carolina state park spanning Chatham County, and Wake County, North Carolina. It comprises of woodlands along the shores of Jordan Lake.

==History==
The New Hope River Valley, now home to the corporate world of Research Triangle Park, has been the site of a broad range of cultures for more than 10,000 years. Archaeologists have explored the remains of 450 prehistoric and historic sites in the area and have uncovered many Native American artifacts. The land was settled by Scottish Highlanders in the 1740s, and it saw action in both the Revolutionary and Civil wars.

Following a disastrous hurricane, which struck the Cape Fear River Basin in 1945, Congress directed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake a comprehensive study of water resource needs in the area. The project, then known as New Hope Lake, was authorized in 1963 and construction began in 1967. In 1973, the name of the project was changed to B. Everett Jordan Dam and Lake in honor of the former senator from North Carolina.

Jordan Lake Park&#x27;s are not only a popular source of recreation, they also provide the water supply for surrounding cities, flood and water quality control, and fish and wildlife conservation.

==Recreational use==

The Jordan Lake State Recreation Area is divided into several smaller areas: Farrington Point, Crosswinds, White Oak, Poplar Point, Ebenezer Church, New Hope Overlook and Poes ridge along the eastern shoreline and Robeson Creek, Vista Point, Seaforth, Parkers Creek, and the Jordan Lake Educational State Forest along the western shore. Swimming, boating, hiking, fishing, hunting, birdwatching and picnicking are popular activities making up 3 Boat ramps, 1 canoe launch, 2 swim beaches, 2 play grounds, 3 fishing piers (including an ADA accessible one), a marina, and 5 campgrounds. Facilities are managed by North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation, North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, North Carolina Division of Forest Resources, US Army Corps of Engineers, Wake County Parks and Recreation, and a privately managed marina.

Events held at the park include monthly skywatching sessions offered by park rangers, the Morehead Planetarium and Science Center in nearby Chapel Hill, and volunteer amateur astronomers from the Chapel Hill Astronomical and Observing Society at the Ebenezer Church Recreation Area in the park.

<text>Lake Waccamaw State Park is a North Carolina state park in Columbus County, North Carolina, in the United States. Located near the town of Lake Waccamaw, North Carolina, it covers , along the shores of Lake Waccamaw, a Carolina bay. Recent work by the U.S. Geological Survey has interpreted the Carolina Bays as relict thermokarst lakes that formed several thousands of years ago when the climate was colder, drier, and windier. Thermokarst lakes develop by thawing of frozen ground (permafrost) and by subsequent modification by wind and water. Thus, this interpretation suggests that permafrost once extended as far south as the Carolina Bays during the last ice age and (or) previous ice ages.

Lake Waccamaw State Park is located in North Carolina&#x27;s Coastal Plain.

<text>Lumber River State Park is a North Carolina state park along the Lumber River in Scotland, Hoke, Robeson and Columbus counties. It covers along a 115-mile (185-km) stretch of the Lumber River. Lumber River State Park is located in North Carolina&#x27;s Coastal Plain. It was established in 1989 as both a state park and designated as a &quot;Natural and Scenic River&quot; by the North Carolina General Assembly. In addition, it is the only blackwater river in North Carolina to be designated as a National Wild and Scenic River by the Department of the Interior.

Lumber River State Park encompasses parts of four counties along the Lumber River. The headwaters of the river are in Scotland County. The Lumber River bisects Robeson County. The recreational facilities are at the Princess Ann Landing in southeastern Robeson County near the towns of Orrum and Fair Bluff. The river ends in South Carolina, where it joins the Little Pee Dee River about south of the state line.

==History==
The Lumber River is the only blackwater river in North Carolina to be designated as a National Wild and Scenic River by the United States (US) Department of the Interior. The river is long from its headwaters at the confluence of Drowning Creek and Buffalo Creek near Wagram in Scotland County. The river flows freely along its entire course, making it one of the longest unobstructed rivers in North Carolina.

The upper section of the river was designated as a State Recreational Water Trail in 1978. The river was established as a National Canoe Trail in 1981. The lower Lumber River was designated as a State Canoe Trail in 1984. The General Assembly established the Lumber River as a Natural and Scenic River and also as a state park in 1989.

The first European settlements were made by Scots-Irish who migrated to the area in the late 18th century. They chartered Princess Ann in 1796. The town was the second to be established in Robeson County, and the first settled by people ascending the river from South Carolina. Princess Ann has since been abandoned. The name survives in local folklore and as the name of the road that leads to the park.

The recreational facilities for Lumber River State Park are in a section of Robeson County known as Princess Ann.

==Recreation==
The Lumber River has 24 boat launches that serve as access points to Lumber River State Park. The entire length of the river is open to fishing. The common game fish are black crappie, largemouth bass, catfish and redbreast sunfish. All anglers must have a valid fishing license and follow the regulations of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission.

Nine primitive camping sites are located at the Princess Ann section of the park. These campsites are meant to be used by no more than six people at a time. Each camp site features a picnic table and grill, lantern holder, trash can, and fire ring. Princess Ann has several hiking trails and picnic areas, and many municipal and county parks are located on the Lumber River as well.

==Plants and wildlife==
Lumber River State Park provides a habitat for a wide variety of plants and animals. Wildflowers that can be seen at the park include wisteria, sarvis holly, Carolina bogmint, mountain laurel, wild azalea, spider lily and swamp mallow. Trees found in the swamps along the river include bald cypress, water elm, river birch and tulip poplar. Animals and birds in the area include the American alligator, white-tailed deer, American black bear, beavers, and northern river otters; and barred owls, great blue heron, wild turkey, sandpipers and prothonotary warblers.

<text>Medoc Mountain State Park is a North Carolina state park in Halifax County, North Carolina in the United States. It is near Hollister, North Carolina in eastern North Carolina and includes the 325 foot (99 m) peak Medoc Mountain.

==History==
Medoc Mountain is not really a mountain at all; its highest point reaches an elevation of only above sea level. It is, rather, the core of what was once a mighty range of mountains — Medoc Mountain is what remains after millions of years of erosion. The eroded peaks were formed by volcanic action during the Paleozoic Age, about 350 million years ago. An elongated structure of biotite granite, Medoc Mountain has effectively routed the streams of the area around itself and has resisted the erosion typical of the surrounding lowlands. The park sits near the fall line, an area where the hard, resistant rocks of the foothills give way to the softer rocks and sediments of the coastal plain. The northern and western faces of Medoc Mountain have very steep slopes, dropping 160 feet over a distance of less than a quarter mile.

The mountain and surrounding land have long been used for agriculture. Once the property of Sidney Weller, a farmer and educator, the area was used for the cultivation of grapes in the 19th century. Weller produced a highly acclaimed wine known as Weller&#x27;s Halifax and is credited with developing the American system of grape culture and winemaking. It was Weller who named the mountain &quot;Medoc,&quot; after a province in the Bordeaux region of France famous for its vineyards. Weller organized and operated an academy for area children and assisted with the development of the first North Carolina state fair in 1853.

Following Weller&#x27;s death in 1854, his land was sold. The vineyards continued to produce into the early 20th century, but the land was later subdivided, sold and used for the production of other crops. The vineyards disappeared, and little trace of them remains. The high ridge and the slopes of Little Fishing and Bear Swamp creeks are the only places in the area that have not been extensively cultivated. A grist mill operated in the area until the late 19th century.

In the 1920s, a Boy Scout camp was built on the summit of the mountain and, a few years later, lumbermen cut the mountain forest for timber. In the early 1930s, a deposit of molybdenum was discovered near the summit. Exploration of the site occurred then and again in the late 1960s, scarring the land though no significant mining operations took place. For many years, local residents used the area for hunting, horseback riding and hiking.

In 1970, citizens proposed the creation of a state park in the area. In 1972, the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation surveyed a five-county area for a suitable site and recommended Medoc Mountain and the surrounding land. The Halifax Development Commission obtained a one-year option to purchase timber on the mountain from Union Camp, allowing the state time to acquire of land to establish the park.

==Events==
Medoc Mountain State Park is host to the Medoc Trail Marathon annually. The trail races consist of a 10-mile race and a full trail marathon. The inaugural event was held October 4, 2008.

<text>Merchants Millpond State Park is a North Carolina state park in Gates County, North Carolina, in the United States. Located near Gatesville, in North Carolina&#x27;s coastal plain, it covers around a 200-year-old, millpond and Lassiter Swamp. Canoeing is one of the park&#x27;s major attractions. Alligators live in its large cypress swamps.

==History==
Settlement in the Gates County area began in 1660. Residents of early rural communities made a living by farming and lumbering. In the early 18th century, Hunters Millpond was built at the head of Bennetts Creek to provide a means of processing and marketing regional produce. Highway construction destroyed this millpond in 1922. But further downstream, Norfleets Millpond, which was built in 1811, thrived. Gristmills, a sawmill, a farm supply store and other enterprises made the area the center of trade in Gates County. Thus, the pond became known as Merchants Millpond.

Shortly before World War II operations around the millpond came to a halt and millers sold the land to developers. In the 1960s, A.B. Coleman from Moyock, North Carolina purchased the property and later donated , including the millpond, to the state. His generous donation led to the establishment of Merchants Millpond State Park in 1973. In the same year, the Nature Conservancy contributed an additional of woodlands to the park that now encompasses more than .

<text>Morrow Mountain State Park is a state park in Stanly County, North Carolina, U.S. Located near Albemarle, the park includes within the Uwharrie Mountains.

== Geography ==
Morrow Mountain is one of the highest peaks in the Uwharrie Mountains of central North Carolina. When first formed, these mountains rose to nearly above sea level, but erosion has gradually worn them down to little more than high hills that average less than in elevation. These pinnacles are the remains of one of the oldest mountain ranges in the eastern United States. The park contains several peaks, of which Morrow Mountain is a high point at .

The mountain rises some above the surrounding lower terrain, and on a clear day offers superb views of the surrounding countryside. In addition to the mountains, the park also contains the Yadkin-Pee Dee River, one of central North Carolina&#x27;s largest river systems. The river can be seen from the overlook atop Morrow Mountain.
==History==
The discovery of artifacts in the area attests to the presence of Native Americans at least 12,000 years before European settlement. Morrow Mountain was the site of one of the largest quarries in the Piedmont of today&#x27;s North and South Carolina. 
Just a little east of the small town of Badin, in northeastern Stanly County, is an archeological dig location known as the Hardaway Site; and it has been a treasure trove for scholars and enthusiasts for decades. Stone tools and weapon points by the thousands have been excavated, and represent one of the most extensive bodies of Native American stone work in existence. The Hardaway Site has been referred to as &quot;The Remington Arms Factory of 10,000 BC&quot;, but the raw material for those weapon points and tools came primarily from one location: the top of Morrow Mountain, about 5 miles away. Tools made from this stone, rhyolite—or more accurately for this specific stone, rhyodacite— were traded among native peoples and have been found from Maine to Florida.

European colonization began along the banks of the Pee Dee River in the 1700s. In 1780, John Kirk, a Scotch-Irish settler, established a public ferry linking the area to a major roadway, the Salisbury-Fayetteville Rd. Local legends recount the passage of noted people, including Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and Jefferson Davis.

Development of the park began in the 1930s through the efforts of a local committee interested in establishing a state park in the area. By 1937, more than of land had been acquired, much of it donated by the citizens of Stanly County. Morrow Mountain is named for one such citizen of Scotch-Irish descent, James McKnight Morrow, who donated more than 1000 acres to the State on June 29, 1920. The park was opened to the public in the summer of 1939.

Early development of park property was a cooperative effort between state and federal governments. Work crews of the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Work Projects Administration constructed many of the facilities from 1937 to 1942. Additional facilities were added with state funds in the 1950s and 1960s.

== Attractions ==
A scenic overlook at the top of Morrow Mountain provides a panoramic view of the area. There is a large parking area along with picnic areas, grills, and a shelter.
Boating and fishing are available on Lake Tillery, and an Olympic size swimming pool is open from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. Due to varying currents and underwater hazards, swimming is not allowed from the shore of the lake.

==Lake Tillery==
Part of the Uwharrie River and Pee Dee River system, Lake Tillery was formed when the Tillery Dam was built in 1928. Morrow Mountain State Park has a boat launch as well as a waterfront picnic area and a fishing pier. A boardwalk connects the parking area to the boat launch area. Canoes may be rented from The Boathouse daily during the summer. Spring and Fall rentals are available on weekends from April through October. The Boathouse sells soft drinks and snacks along with ice and bait.

==Kron House==
A reconstruction of the historic Kron House is on the site at the foot of Fall Mountain. The house was built by a Scottish preacher, William McGregor, who sold it to Dr. Francis Kron on November 2, 1839. Dr. Kron and his family lived here for the remainder of their lives, building their small farm into a sizable tract at one time containing well over . 
Dr. Kron was born in Prussia and immigrated to America in 1823. He was one of the Southern Piedmont&#x27;s most famous doctors. Kron was known for traveling for days at a time, making house calls to those bitterly sick. Dr. Kron practiced medicine until after the age of 80. A noted horticulturist, he was also actively involved in education. A Japanese Chestnut tree (Castanea crenata) planted by Kron still thrives and is listed in North Carolina&#x27;s Champion Big Tree Database. His home, doctor&#x27;s office and infirmary, and greenhouse appear today much as they did in 1870. Morrow Mountain State Park reconstructed his house in the 1960s and now offers tours.
In addition to practicing medicine, Dr. Kron conducted many horticultural experiments and was an active public figure in the county until his death in 1883. Since his wife had died in 1873, ownership of the family holdings passed to his two daughters, Elizabeth and Adele. The sisters began selling their property in 1850 and continued to do so for the remainder of their 
lives. Elizabeth died in 1896 and Adele in 1910, and both were buried in the family graveyard behind the home.

==Camping==
Morrow Mountain has four camping areas.

The Family Camping area has three loops where tents, RVs and trailers can be taken. Sites are available with or without electrical hookups, and the park has 6 electric sites that are handicap accessible.

The 6 Group Campsites are on the east side of the park, up a hill near the Tillery shoreline. Up to 35 campers are allowed on each site.

Remote primitive campsites are accessible through the Backpack Trail and have one latrine with no running water. The hike in is approximately two miles. This is a low impact area. Everything, including trash, must be packed in and packed out. Fire rings were recently installed to allow camp fires in this area.

Six cabins are near the park office. One cabin, cabin #6, is handicap accessible. The cabins have modern conveniences such as stoves, drip coffee makers, microwaves, refrigerators, pots and pans and flatware along with outdoor pedestal grills. All have fireplaces and screened back porches furnished with rocking chairs. Guests need to bring their own bedding, towels and coffee filters. Each Cabin has two bedrooms, each with two twin sized beds. The living room couch is a futon that folds out to make a 5th double sized bed.

==Museum==
A small museum commemorating the history of the Uwharries is on the far end of the Camp Office parking lot. Exhibits include information about Native Americans, area plant and animal communities, early explorers, and rocks and minerals. It is open daily from 10 to 5. It is a self-guided tour.

== Trails ==
With of trail in the park, Morrow Mountain is one of the most hiked state parks in North Carolina. All hiking trails are blazed. Switchbacks or sharp changes in trail direction are denoted by double-blazing.

Backpack Trail: A trail, this white circle blazed trail takes backpackers to Primitive campsites 1, 2 and 3. It splits from the Morrow Mountain/Sugarloaf Mountain Trail and ends in Campsite 3 by the latrine. At the end of the Backpack Trail, one can bushwhack due South to reach the Bridle Trail, which one can then take to the Morrow Mountain Trail.
Difficulty = Easy

Bridle Trail: Morrow Mountain State Park has of horse trails, which may also be used for hiking. In 2005, the Bridle Trail was split into 3 different trails. In 2006, the State Park renamed spurs of the trail, which now includes a quick section known as Duck Blind Cove Spur Trail. The Short Loop (white horse circle blazes) includes a hike or ride to and around Morrow Mountain. The Middle Loop is a trail, marked with blue circle blazes, and it is a longer trail that includes portions of the Short Loop trail. The Long Loop is a trail; it circles the Morrow Mountain vicinity as well as the northern section of the park.

Campground and Pool Trail: This trail is blazed with white triangles. This trail starts across from the Morrow Mountain pool and runs through the woods, connecting the pool, the camp office, and the three family campground loops. The trail is mostly in woods, but runs through some undergrowth. The Morrow Mountain amphitheater is also near the end of the trail. The trail ends at campground Loop B, near the Rocks Trail.

Hattaway Mountain Trail: This loop is classified as strenuous. Starting at the Morrow Mountain pool, this trail goes about two tenths of a mile before hikers may choose one of two directions on this loop trail. Turning left leads to an immediate climb up Hattaway, a half-mile trek straight uphill. After reaching the top of the mountain, the hiker will begin to descend the mountain, sharply at first and then slowly. Upon reaching a ridge, the trail rolls up and down the Uwharrie hills for nearly a mile. Along the trail some of the best autumn views can be seen, as hikers can see deep woods. Hattaway offers glimpses of one of the parks many quartz veins.

Fall Mountain Trail: A trail blazed with orange triangles, encompasses Fall Mountain in the park&#x27;s North Eastern region. It is a moderate climb up and then a steep descent down to Lake Tillery. From there, hikers walk the rest of the way along the shoreline. This trail once led to Fall&#x27;s Dam, but the trail&#x27;s path is constantly shifting due to erosion. 
Laurel Trail: , blazed with red hexagons. This short loop trail goes around the Morrow Mountain camping area in deep forest and tall undergrowth. The trail starts at the far end of the camp office parking lot and loops before returning to the start. Turning right at the start of the loop will take you through a deep thicket of undergrowth before finally emerging in deep woods. The trail crosses over many creeks and is the main way to connect to the Morrow Mountain trail. This short loop is the most popular trail in the park for children.

Morrow Mountain Trail: A (one way) trail that starts at the camp office and ends at the Mountain Loop Trail at the Overlook, the Morrow Mountain Trail is the most hiked trail in the park. Going up Morrow Mountain (or going down) is a decent climb and for the rest of the trail (blue triangle blazes) the trail rolls up and down hills. The trail is the only way to get to the Backpack trail and also joins the Sugarloaf Mountain trail for a mile. The trail takes hikers through deep flora, and one stretch, called &quot;The Jungle&quot;, takes hikers though tall stands of Mountain Laurel.

Mountain Loop Trail: A trail, blazed with red squares, that circles the top of Morrow Mountain, this loop trail provides some of the best views in the park. You can look down from the trail into the depths of the park, seeing for nearly a mile. The Mountain Loop also includes the aforementioned Overlook Picnic Area.

Quarry Trail: A trail, blazed with blue hexagons, takes hikers around the edge of the Morrow Mountain picnic area and into the former quarry. For much of the early 20th century, the area was mined for rocks. Hikers may enjoy the evenly cut paths and the washhouses. &quot;Near the end of the trail, there is a spur trail&quot; to the quarry, where hikers can inspect the quarry handiwork.

Rocks Trail: Some consider the Rocks Trail to be the most scenic trail in the park. A (one way) trail blazed with blue squares, the Rocks trail slopes through the rolling hills of the Uwharrie woods. At the end, the Rocks trail goes into a massive rock outcropping at the lakeshore. The rocks are stable, but a large &quot;Warning&quot; sign reminds hikers to watch their footing. The view of Tillery Lake from the Rocks Trail is one of the Uwharrie region&#x27;s most famous views.

Sugarloaf Mountain Trail: The most strenuous trail in the park, Sugarloaf is a tough haul. Most of the trail is winding hills. This is a loop blazed with orange diamonds, starting at the Bridle Trail parking lot. Upon reaching the top, the trail drops about in a quarter of a mile. After going down, the trail joins the Morrow Mountain Trail before bending off back to the Bridle Trail parking lot. The view from the top of Sugarloaf is often clouded, but on a clear day, Sugarloaf&#x27;s summit is one of the most scenic viewpoints in the park.

Three Rivers Trail: Officially considered the nature trail of the park, this trail, blazed with blue hexagons, has seen better days. Many of the piers that once dotted the Tillery shoreline have fallen in, but the trail is still commonly hiked. The trail, starting in the Tillery/Boathouse parking lot, goes through marshes and woods, connecting all of the park&#x27;s ecosystems along one short trail. After passing through marshland and coastline, the trail ascends a small hill, where hikers can find deep woods and wildflowers. The trail then slowly descends the mountain.

==Expansion==
The park added in 2018 and in 2019 along Mountain Creek in Stony Hill Church Hardwoods, considered a natural heritage area by the N.C. Natural Heritage Program. The area includes mature hardwood forest and endangered mussels such as Carolina creekshell, as well as the timber rattlesnake.

==Weather==
The remnants of Hurricane Hugo in 1989 caused enough damage to close the park for two weeks.

The remnants of Hurricane Fran in September 1996 closed the park as fallen trees and other damage had to be cleaned up. Parts of the park reopened January 25, 1997.

The January 2000 North American blizzard closed the park for three months.

The North Carolina ice storm of 2002 closed parts of the park in December 2002.

A line of severe thunderstorms associated with a derecho struck Morrow Mountain State Park and the surrounding area on June 13, 2013. A microburst did severe damage to the park, which was closed for two months. According to a statement from park superintendent Greg Schneider on June 17, &quot;Morrow Mountain took a really big hit from the storm and I suspect that the facilities will be closed for several weeks. We have had lots of damage to park buildings, privately owned automobiles, and of course there are down and leaning trees everywhere.&quot; The park office had been damaged by a fallen tree, and one campground cabin had been crushed. Hundreds of trees were down in the park, and Local Fire and Rescue Squad officials had to cut their way up the road to the summit, and Campground to account for any stranded visitors. The campground was also hard hit, with reports of damaged or destroyed RV&#x27;s and campers. There were no known injuries or fatalities. Parts of the park reopened August 5.

<text>Mount Jefferson State Natural Area is a North Carolina state park in Ashe County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Jefferson, North Carolina, it includes the peak of Mount Jefferson, named for Thomas Jefferson and his father Peter, who owned land nearby and surveyed the North Carolina-Virginia border in 1749. In 1974, Mount Jefferson State Natural Area was designated as a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service.

==History==
In 1939 the Works Progress Administration created a road enabling widespread access to Mount Jefferson, which at the time had no official name and was primarily referenced to as Panther Mountain, likely due to a local legend of a panther once eating a child there. Local citizens donated land and money in efforts to attain state park status for the local park, which required the park to have a minimum of . By 1956, their efforts yielded a donation and raised enough funds to buy an additional for the park. As a result, Mount Jefferson received its official name and became a state park in October 1956.
==Tourist information==
The park has one main road that leads to the peak of Mount Jefferson. On the way up are three overlooks; the Sunset Overlook, the Sunrise Overlook, and the Jefferson Overlook, as well as five hiking trails and a picnic shelter at the top. From the picnic shelter begins the Summit Trail, a that leads to the Rhodedendron Trail loop. At the end of the loop lies a short trail to the scenic Luther Rock, as well as the entrances to the Lost Province Trail loop. The mountain itself rises to more than above the surrounding landscape and provides a bird&#x27;s-eye view of both Jefferson and West Jefferson. Park hours are limited by inclement weather, but otherwise open every day until sunset during the year with the exception of Christmas Day. The , one-way Mountain Ridge Trail, which ascends to the peak of the mountain and through each overlook, may be accessed at the first park gate across from the park office during inclement weather, though caution is advised.

<text>Mount Mitchell State Park is a North Carolina state park in Yancey County, North Carolina in the United States. Established in 1915 by the state legislature, it became the first state park of North Carolina. By doing so, it also established the North Carolina State Parks System within the same bill.
Located at the end of NC 128 off the Blue Ridge Parkway near Burnsville, North Carolina, it includes the peak of Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi River. From the parking lot, a steep paved path leads visitors to the summit and a raised observation platform with 360 degree views. The grave of Elisha Mitchell, the professor who first noted the mountain&#x27;s height, is located at the base of the observation platform. The old observation tower was torn down in early October 2006. The trail leading to the summit has been paved, and a new observation platform was constructed and opened to the public in January 2009.

An exhibit hall is open seasonally at the summit with information about the mountain&#x27;s natural, cultural and historical heritage. The park operates a restaurant and a small tent camping sites seasonally. The buildings were built in the 1950s and renovation is planned. Most visitors come between May and November because the only access is the Blue Ridge Parkway but Kevin Bischof, who became superintendent late in 2018, hopes to change that. The park is staffed year-round but most people would not be able to reach the park during the worst weather conditions.

The park had 398,000 visitors in 2017.

In addition to Mount Mitchell itself, the park encompasses several other peaks which top out at over in elevation, including Mount Hallback, Mount Craig (just shy of Mount Mitchell in elevation and the second highest peak east of the Mississippi River), Big Tom and Balsam Cone. Trails lead to all these summits save Mount Hallback, and their exploration takes visitors away from the crowds on Mount Mitchell but to places similarly spectacular. About of trails exist within the park in all.

Another popular destination reachable by trail within the park is Camp Alice, at an elevation of 5800 ft (1767.84 m) south of the summit of Mount Mitchell. This historic site is the location of a logging and, later, Civilian Conservation Corps tourist camp at the terminus of the old Mount Mitchell toll road. Lower Creek flows across the main trail at this point and it is one of the highest elevation perennial streams in the Appalachians, flowing through the Spruce-Fir forest. Openings here in the forest surrounded by evergreens resemble such openings near treeline in higher mountain ranges.
The park also serves as the finish line for The Assault on Mount Mitchell and the midpoint for the Mount Mitchell Challenge ultramarathon.

<text>New River State Park is a North Carolina state park in Ashe County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Jefferson, North Carolina, it covers in the protected New River watershed. The New River is one of the oldest rivers in the United States. It is considered by some geologists to be possibly one of the oldest rivers in the world, between 10 million and 360 million years old. New River State Park is open for year-round recreation, including canoeing, hiking, picnicking, fishing, camping and environmental education. The park is just off U.S. Route 221 in northwestern North Carolina.

==History==
The New River is one of the oldest rivers in the United States and possibly in the world, with only the Nile River being older. The exact age of the river is impossible to pinpoint, but some geologists believe that it is between 10 million and 360 million years old. The river flows in a generally south-to-north course, which is against the southwest-to-northeast topology of the Appalachian Mountains and the west-to-east flow of most other nearby major rivers. This peculiarity may mean that the New River&#x27;s formation preceded much of the surrounding landscape.

The river was named in 1651 by Edward Bland a cartographer in England made a map describing the western reaches of colonial Carolina and Virginia. The New River had not been placed on any preceding maps of the area, so Bland named it the &quot;New River&quot;. The river was known as Woods River from 1654 until about 1754 for Colonel Abraham Wood at noted pioneer who traded with the native tribes in the area. It was renamed the New River by Peter Jefferson, father of the third President of the United States Thomas Jefferson when he led a surveying party through the mountains of western North Carolina. Apparently the river had again been left off a map so Jefferson named it the New River. The name Woods and New River were used interchangeably until about 1770, when the consensus name became what it is today, the New River.

Human activity along the New River at New River State Park has been traced back as far as 10,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found arrowheads, stone axes and pottery of the Kanawha, Cherokee, Shawnee and Creek tribes. The valley of the New River in what is now Ashe County was a hunting ground for all the tribes and was a major highway from north to south. The natives used both the river and various trails through the valley. Rock shelters along the river have been found, but there is little evidence pointing to any sort of permanent settlement by indigenous peoples.

Colonel Abraham Wood was the earliest European pioneer to reach what is now New River State Park. He arrived in 1654 and found a valley with virgin forests, open meadows and abundant wildlife including, black bear, bison, beaver, and elk. Permanent settlement did not take place until the 1770s when settlers began clearing the mountainous land for farming.

The area in and surrounding New River State Park was largely free of development until 1965 when the Appalachian Power Company applied for a license to build a dam across the New River for hydro-electric power. Local opposition to the project led to the formation of New River State Park in 1975. The North Carolina General Assembly declared that the New River from the confluence of Dog Creek to the Virginia state line was a State Scenic River. The same section of the river was named a National Wild and Scenic River by the United States Department of the Interior in 1976. The legislation of the North Carolina house and the United States Congress have preserved the river a natural state with prohibitions on the building of dams and reservoirs.

==Ecology==

New River State Park is covered by a thriving second growth forest. The old growth forests were harvested for lumber and other wood products. The forests grow in fertile soil that supports a variety of hardwood trees, pine trees, shrubs and wildflowers. Hardwoods such as oak and hickory grow along the banks of the New River and on the lower slopes of the mountains. Carolina hemlock and various pines grow on the higher slopes. Shrubs found at New River State Park include dogwood, huckleberry, alders and sassafras.

New River State Park is home to fourteen threatened and endangered plants that grow in the valley along the New River. Carolina and Carey&#x27;s saxifrage, rattlesnake root, spreading avens and purple sedge are protected and the picking of their flowers is prohibited.

Many animals that are commonly found in an eastern woodland environment can be found at New River State Park. White-tailed deer are a common sight. Black bear are seen less often. Mink, river otters, beavers, muskrats and raccoons inhabit the land along the banks of the New River.

Birds of many different species live at New River State Park. Osprey and red-tailed hawks are birds of prey that can be seen soaring above the park. Wild turkey live in the forested lowlands and ruffed grouse live on the mountain slopes. A wide variety of songbirds live throughout the forests. Wood ducks, spotted sandpipers and belted kingfishers live along the river banks.

<text>Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area is a North Carolina state park in Orange County, North Carolina in the United States. Located adjacent to the town of Hillsborough, it covers and includes Occoneechee Mountain, the highest point (867 ft) in Orange County and a settlement of the Occaneechi tribe.

==History==
Rising more than from the Eno River, the Occoneechee Mountain summit is the highest point in Orange County.

Researchers believe that the area&#x27;s habitat has remained relatively unchanged since the last ice age due to the presence of the brown elfin, a rare butterfly, and several unique plant species. The brown elfin is typically found in mountainous and northern areas, and the nearest brown elfin population to Occoneechee is more than west. When the Piedmont&#x27;s habitat underwent enormous transformations after the Ice Age, the area became unable to support the brown elfin and other species more accustomed to cooler environments. Brown elfins, believed to have once populated the Piedmont, were restricted to the state&#x27;s mountains. However, the brown elfin butterflies at Occoneechee Mountain remained.

The land the state natural area now sits on was originally settled by the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation, who traveled to the mountain from the west. In the colonial period, European immigrants settled the area. Until 1987, a mill village occupied a section of the natural area. The NC Division of Parks and Recreation first purchased land at Occoneechee Mountain in December 1997. Since then, the natural area has grown to 

==Recreation==
Occoneechee Mountain State Natural Area features over 3 miles of trails, as well as fishing and picnic areas. The park&#x27;s trail network also connects to the paved Hillsborough Riverwalk trail, which extends east along the Eno River towards downtown Hillsborough.

<text>Pettigrew State Park is a North Carolina State Park in Tyrrell and Washington Counties, North Carolina in the United States. It covers around the shore lines of Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The park&#x27;s developed facilities are south of U.S. Route 64 near Roper and Creswell, North Carolina. Pettigrew State Park is open for year-round recreation, including hiking, camping, fishing, boating and picnicking.

Pettigrew State Park is named for Confederate General J. Johnston Pettigrew, who lived in a nearby home. It surrounds Somerset Place, a North Carolina state historic site that includes a restored 1830s plantation house and outbuildings that can be toured, including reconstructed slave quarters.

Pettigrew State Park was established during the Great Depression after the land was leased from the Farm Security Administration, a New Deal program of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Part of Pettigrew State Park surrounds Lake Phelps, one of the oldest lakes in the eastern United States and a former hunting and fishing ground for the Algonquian peoples. Archaeologists have found dugout canoes in the lake that are up to 4,400 years old, preserved by its unusually clean waters. Pettigrew is home to an abundance of wildlife: Lake Phelps is a primary wintering location for several types of waterfowl, including Canada geese and Tundra swans. The park is also home to the woodland creatures, such as raccoons and white-tailed deer, that are commonly found along the east coast of the United States. Lake Phelps contains several species of game fish including largemouth bass and catfish.

The park also manages the Lake Phelps, which is a North Carolina State Lake. All together, the park manages .

==Geology==
Pettigrew State Park surrounds Lake Phelps, North Carolina&#x27;s second largest natural made lake. The lake, on a peninsula between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, is one of a series of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Recent work by the U.S. Geological Survey has interpreted the Carolina Bays as relict thermokarst lakes that formed several thousands of years ago when the climate was colder, drier, and windier. Thermokarst lakes develop by thawing of frozen ground (permafrost) and by subsequent modification by wind and water. Thus, this interpretation suggests that permafrost once extended as far south as the Carolina Bays during the last ice age and (or) previous ice ages. Lake Phelps is not fed by any stream, but relies entirely upon rain and springs to maintain its water level. Since the lake is not fed by a stream that could carry pollutants from nearby farms and factories, the water is very clean. Lake Phelps is five miles (8 km) across, with an average depth of just 4.5 feet (1.5 m). The lake is thought to be more than 38,000 years old.

==Human History==
===Early inhabitants===
Lake Phelps is named for Josiah Phelps, the first white man to enter its waters. Phelps and another colonial explorer, Benjamin, were searching through what was then known as the Great Eastern Dismal or Great Alligator Dismal in 1755. Phelps and Tarkington were part of a group of hunters who entered the swamps in search of game and farmland. The group had become discouraged and were about to leave when Tarkington scaled one of the trees and spotted the lake a short distance away. Phelps went ahead and ran into the water. As the first in the water he was given the honor of naming the lake.

The history of human habitation in and around Pettigrew State Park stretches back as far as 8000 BC. Archaeologists have found thousands of relics at the park, including pottery, arrowheads, and sunken dugout canoes. Estimates place some of the dugouts as being at least 4,400 years old. They were preserved in the bottom of the lake by its unusually clean waters.

The dugouts were created by Algonquian peoples who were seasonal visitors to the area. They built them from the logs of cypress by slowly burning out the center of the log and scraping the burnt wood out, leaving only the outer shell. Historians believe that the Algonquian would sink their canoes to the bottom of the lake for safekeeping until they would return the following fishing and hunting season. Thirty of these ancient canoes have been found in Lake Phelps, with perhaps more yet to be discovered.
===Plantation era===
Josiah Collins was one of the first European-descended settlers to live and farm in the area of Pettigrew State Park, arriving in the 1780s. Collins and his partners used slave labor to drain the swamps surrounding Lake Phelps and establish an extensive plantation known as Somerset Place.

Collins and his partners brought in slaves from Africa to dig a canal from Lake Phelps to the Scuppernong River. The canal served two purposes: first, as a means of transporting goods and people to and from the plantation; and second, it served as a massive drainage ditch as the slaves of Somerset Place worked to drain the surrounding swamps. Later, the canal system was expanded to provide irrigation for the rice and corn fields of the plantation.

Pettigrew State Park is named for J. Johnston Pettigrew, a Confederate General who lies buried in the family cemetery in the park. Pettigrew was one of the commanding officers at the Battle of Gettysburg and led a division during Pickett&#x27;s Charge. He sustained mortal wounds during General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s retreat from Gettysburg. The general, who grew up on a farm that adjoined Somerset Place, is buried with his father and grandfather. Their final resting place is a popular stopping point for visitors to the park.

Somerset Place was a prosperous plantation until the American Civil War, when plantation life was forever altered by Abraham Lincoln and freeing of the plantation&#x27;s slaves. The Collins family was unable to maintain the plantation without slave labor following the war and sold it off.

===State park era===
Somerset Place and the land that is now Pettigrew State Park passed through the hands of several owners until it was acquired by the Farm Security Administration in 1937 during the Great Depression. The state of North Carolina administers the land under the terms of a 99-year lease signed in 1939 with the United States Department of Agriculture. Pettigrew State Park has been expanded at various times since it opened in 1939. Two of the most recent land acquisitions included adding the entire shoreline of Lake Phelps, and the largest expansion, which took place along the Scuppernong River in 2004.

The Scuppernong had remained largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, the town of Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like black tea or coffee. The Scuppernong served as a means of transportation for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it in its most natural state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong if the state would purchase three more tracts that became available that same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.

==Ecology==

===Plant life===

Pettigrew State Park is home to one of the last stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald cypress and poplar are found on the northern shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to ten feet (3 m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of six feet (2 m). There are vines that are as wide as an average man&#x27;s leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130 feet (40 m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes. Several of the trees at Pettigrew State Park are listed on the North Carolina and National Registries of Big Trees.

Wildflowers are found throughout Pettigrew State Park. Atamasco lily, periwinkle, buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit, maypops, and jewelweed are sometimes found on the banks and in the shallows of Lake Phelps. The Scuppernong River provides a habitat for swamp dogwood, evening primrose, blue flag iris and cardinal flowers. The roughleaf dogwood is also found near the river. This particular dogwood is rare in North Carolina and the type along the Scuppernong is rarer still.

===Animal life===

Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River attract a wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow freshwater lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and Canada geese feed in nearby farm fields and the ducks feed in the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, tundra swans, mallards, American black ducks and northern pintail.

Pettigrew State Park is home to several species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in the tops of the tallest trees in the park and feed on the abundant fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.

Wading and woodland birds are year-round residents of Pettigrew State Park. The banks of Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River provide an abundance of cover and food for sandpipers, great blue herons, great egrets, and green herons. The woods are home to bobwhites, pileated woodpeckers, woodcocks, red-cockaded woodpeckers, and mourning doves. Songbirds found at the park include prairie and prothonotary warblers, common yellowthroats and northern parulas.

Pettigrew State Park also provides habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and white-tailed deer inhabit the woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, American mink, muskrat, North American river otter, fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.

The most common species are game fish, found in Lake Phelps, are largemouth bass, chain pickerel, catfish, yellow perch and pumpkinseed. These fish are what brought the Algonquian to the area nearly 10,000 years ago.

==Recreation==
Pettigrew State Park is open for year-round recreation, including hiking, fishing, camping, boating and picnicking. Lake Phelps is open to canoes, kayaks, rowboats and engine-powered boats. Launch ramps are available at Cypress Point and behind the park offices on Lake Shore Drive. There is a canoe trail in the canals that were built by African slave labor during the plantation era. The Scuppernong River is also open to most types of watercraft.

The main campground is in a cypress and sweetgum forest, with 13 campsites that are open to tents or camping trailers. Each site comes equipped with a picnic table and charcoal grill. . A large group camping area is set in the forest. It has tent pads, grills and rustic toilet facilities. A centrally located bathhouse, open to all campers, includes flush toilets and showers.

Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River are both open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has established fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that are meant to enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20 inches (50.8 cm) or between 14 and 16 inches (35.6-40.6 cm). This rule was put in place to increase the number of trophy fish, fish over 20 inches (50.8 cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.

Pettigrew State Park has one large picnic area available on a first come, first served basis. Three hiking trails pass the shore of Lake Phelps and wind through the woods.

<text>Pilot Mountain State Park is a North Carolina state park in Surry and Yadkin Counties, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Pinnacle, North Carolina on highway US 52, it covers and includes the distinctive 2,241 foot (683 m) peak of Pilot Mountain.

==History==
The Saura, a Native American tribe of the North Carolina Piedmont region, knew the mountain as &quot;Jomeokee&quot; meaning the &quot;Great Guide&quot;. It served as a guidepost also for the European settlers of the Carolina who similarly named it &quot;Pilot&quot;.

Due to the effects of European diseases and attacks by northern Indians, particularly the Seneca, the Saura Indians abandoned the area around 1700. The first European settlers in the area arrived in the late 1740s from Pennsylvania. Settlement in the area was slow due to its isolation. There are numerous accounts in the Records of the Moravians in North Carolina which related to groups of highwaymen, or bandits, who used the mountains as a refuge throughout the 1750s and 1760s.

After serving as a commercial tourist attraction, Pilot Mountain became a North Carolina state park in 1968. It was established as a state park in order to protect the mountain and surrounding lands from being overdeveloped. The Pilot Mountain Preservation and Park Committee purchased the land from Mrs. J. W. Beasley by raising funds and acquired a grant from the federal government. Additional lands along the Yadkin River were purchased in 1970. Further purchases have brought Pilot Mountain State Park to a total size of 3,703 acres (14.99 km2).

On November 8, 2012, a prescribed burn of 70 acres got out of control leading to a wildfire on the mountain&#x27;s steep western slope.

In November 27, 2021, a massive wildfire broke out across Pilot Mountain State Park that has since grown to over 300 acres.

==Recreation==
Pilot Mountain State Park is for year-round recreation. Activities at the park include, camping, canoeing, fishing, rock climbing, picnicking, hiking, and environmental education.

The Yadkin River provides opportunities for visitors to the park to fish and canoe. The Yadkin River Canoe Trail is 165 mile (265 km) long and follows the course of the river to its confluence with the Uwharrie River at the Pee Dee River in south central North Carolina. Two miles (3.22 km) of the river pass through Pilot Mountain State Park. The river is broad and shallow at the park with two islands that can be reached by canoe or by wading when the water level is low. All anglers need to have a license from the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission. The common game fish are sunfish, catfish and crappie.

A family camping area is on the lower slopes of Pilot Mountain. It has 49 campsites that are open to tents or trailers that are scattered in a forest of hickory and oak trees. Each campsite comes equipped with a charcoal grill, picnic table and tent pad. Modern restroom facilities with hot water and showers are located nearby. A large and rustic youth group camping area is located on the north side of the park&#x27;s Yadkin River Section. Canoeists are not permitted to camp on the islands of the river. A designated canoe campsite on the bank is available by reservation by contacting the park office.

There are three picnic areas at Pilot Mountain State Park. One picnic area is near the summit parking lot and two are near the Yadkin River. The area has many picnic tables and grills. No drinking water is available in this area. Pit toilets are available.

Rock climbing is permitted in some designated sections of the park. All climbers must register with park staff. Climbing and rappelling are not permitted on the face of Pilot Mountain, Big Pinnacle. A list of rules and regulations can be obtained from the park offices. Many miles of trail at Pilot Mountain State Park are open to hiking and horse back riding. Rules and regulations can be obtained at the park offices.

==Ecology==
The ecology of Pilot Mountain State Park is similar to the ecology of the Blue Ridge Mountains which are west of Surry County. Big Pinnacle is ringed by Catawba rhododendron which has pink blossoms in the spring, making the mountain appear as if it is wearing a &quot;pink crown&quot;. Mountain laurel can be found throughout the park as can wild blueberry, huckleberry and grapes. The forests are mainly chestnut oak, Table Mountain pine and pitch pine trees.

Wildlife consists of animals that are typical to an eastern woodland environment including the American toad, Carolina wren, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons. There are often vultures soaring on the updrafts from Pilot Knob, and may be joined by the occasional common raven which are not common east of the Blue Ridge Mountains

<text>Raven Rock State Park is a North Carolina state park in Harnett County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Lillington, North Carolina, it covers along the banks of the Cape Fear River. Raven Rock State Park is located on the eastern edge of the Piedmont.

==History==
Raven Rock State Park sits along the fall line, an area where the hard, resistant rocks of the foothills give way to the softer rocks and sediments of the coastal plain. The underlying rocks of the area were formed more than 400 million years ago by intense heat and pressure.

Through the ages, flowing waters and swirling winds gradually eroded the land, carving and sculpting Raven Rock. This immense crystalline structure rises to and stretches for more than a mile along the Cape Fear River. The rock was originally called Patterson&#x27;s Rock for an early settler who found refuge there when his canoe capsized nearby. In 1854, its name was changed to Raven Rock, inspired by the sight of ravens that formerly roosted on rock ledges.

The Siouan and Tuscarora Indians hunted the area until European settlers arrived in the mid-18th century. The first settlers were primarily hunters and trappers who were searching for high country similar to their native country, Scotland. Later, stores, mills and quarries were built. Many of the woodlands were farmed, and as the forests returned, much of the land was harvested for timber.

A road that stretched from Raleigh to Fayetteville crossed the Cape Fear River via the Northington Ferry and served as the area&#x27;s major transportation route. Locks and dams were built along the river to facilitate navigation by boat, and Raven Rock became an important landmark for river pilots. After a hurricane destroyed the locks and dams in 1859, the structures were not replaced; railroad transportation eliminated the need for river travel. As new roads were built, the ferry was closed and Raven Rock became a popular recreation spot. The remnants of the Northington lock and dam can still be seen in the park.

In 1965, interest grew in preserving the area as a state park, and local citizens organized support for the project. In 1969, a bill establishing the park was passed in the General Assembly. More than of land were purchased and another were donated by Burlington Industries. Additional tracts have since been purchased, bringing the park to its present size of .

==Information==
The park offers a picnic area, places for fishing and canoeing, and camp grounds. There are also several hiking trails, including the American Beech Trail (0.5 miles), Campbell Creek Loop (5.0 miles), Fish Traps Trail (0.6 miles), Lanier Falls Trail (0.2 miles), Little Creek Loop (1.5 miles), Northington Ferry Trail (0.9 miles), and the Raven Rock Loop (2.6 miles). There are also horseback riding trails on the north side of the Cape Fear River.

The Raven Rock Loop splits off in two directions. One leads to the Raven Rock, a high and one mile (1.6 km) long rock formation along the river. The other leads to the Overlook, a small manmade stone structure high above the Cape Fear River, giving a clear view of both the river and the undeveloped woodlands.

<text>Singletary Lake State Park is a North Carolina state park in Bladen County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Elizabethtown, it covers , including Singletary Lake, one of the largest Carolina bays. Singletary Lake State Park is southeast of Elizabethtown on North Carolina Highway 53 in North Carolina&#x27;s Coastal Plain region. It serves primarily as a group camp but is open on a limited basis for year-round recreation, including hiking, fishing and observing nature.

==Geology==
Singletary Lake is one of a series of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. Recent work by the U.S. Geological Survey has interpreted the Carolina Bays as relict thermokarst lakes that formed several thousands of years ago when the climate was colder, drier, and windier. Thermokarst lakes develop by thawing of frozen ground (permafrost) and by subsequent modification by wind and water. Thus, this interpretation suggests that permafrost once extended as far south as the Carolina Bays during the last ice age and (or) previous ice ages. Singletary Lake is not fed by any stream but relies entirely upon rain. The land beneath and surrounding the lake is mica-rich sandy clay and sand that is from the Upper Cretaceous era with a thin layer of Pleistocene deposits covering it. This land is lower than the surrounding land and drains very poorly, creating Singletary Lake.
==Human history==
The Singletary Lake area was settled by colonists under the leadership of Richard Singletary who received a grant for land in Bladen County from the government of the Province of North Carolina in 1729. The early settlers quickly cleared the land for farming, ships masts, other wood products and naval stores. Singletary Lake, a Carolina Bay was not drained for farming as many of the bays in the surrounding area.

The government of the state of North Carolina began to take an interest in Singletary Lake and other Carolina Bays in the 19th century. The North Carolina General Assembly blocked all further private claims on lakes. Soon after, the state assembly pass legislation that granted ownership of all lakes greater than 500 acres (2.02 km2) in Cumberland, Columbus and Bladen Counties to the state. The formation of Jones Lake, Lake Waccamaw and Singletary Lake state parks can be traced back to this piece of legislation.

The growth of the cotton, turpentine and lumber industries in the area of Singletary Lake State Park eventually became greater than the soil could support. The fertility of the farmland was depleted and most of the standing timber had been clear cut from Bladen County. The land could no longer support the demands of the people living on the land. Farmers were no longer able to produce sustainable crops and many were forced to leave their farms.

The National Park Service began purchasing the land surrounding Singletary Lake in 1936 for a recreational demonstration project. Out of work young men were employed by the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was established by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 during the Great Depression with many of the facilities of Singletary Lake State Park. The land was managed by the Resettlement Administration until 1939. From 1936 until 1939, youths working for the CCC built the Singletary Recreation Center. They constructed an office, maintenance buildings and recreation facilities on the shore of Singletary Lake. The CCC also built a ten cabin camp with a dining hall, workshop and recreation hall.
Singletary Lake State Park was established in 1939 when management of the park was transferred from the federal government to the state government. The cabins built by the CCC became Camp Ipecac which is still in use by large groups like the Boy Scouts of America and 4-H. The park became state property in 1954.

Singletary Lake State Park has provided more than recreation to the citizens of North Carolina. It was used by the American Red Cross during the 1945 floods of the Cape Fear River as a refugee center. Soldiers training for World War II at nearby Camp Davis used Singletary Lake State Park for special anti-aircraft training.

==Ecology==

Singletary Lake is surrounded by a bay forest. This forest consists primarily of bay trees such as the loblolly, red bay, pond pine and Atlantic white cedar. The understory consists of huckleberry, leucothoe, gallberry and pepperbush. turkey oak, blueberry, holly and longleaf pine can be found at the higher elevations away from the shoreline.

The forests of Singletary Lake State Park provide a habitat for a variety of animals that are fairly common to an eastern woodland habitat. Wild turkey, white-tailed deer and rabbits can be spotted from time to time. Wood ducks live on the lake. Red-cockaded woodpeckers can be seen in the forest as can red-tailed hawks and pileated woodpeckers. Singletary Lake State Park is also home to box turtles, fence lizards, southern toads, and carpenter frogs.

The Turkey Oak Natural Area is a 133 acre (0.54 km2) natural area that was set aside by the Society of American Foresters in the early 1960s. The aim of the natural area is to preserve the forest in a natural state for scientific study and educational opportunities. The Turkey Oak Natural Area is in the southeastern portion of Singletary Lake State Park in a bay bog and along a sand ridge.

==Recreation==

Singletary Lake State Park is unique among North Carolina state parks. It is used primarily by private groups that have made arrangements to camp at Camp Ipecac or Camp Loblolly Bay, the two group camping facilities at the park. Visitors to the park are permitted access when the camp facilities are not in use.

Camp Ipecac was built in 1939 by the Resettlement Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. It houses 92 campers in ten cabins. It is named for the Carolina ipecac, a herb that is used in traditional medicine. Camp Loblolly Bay was built in 1984 and houses 48 campers. It is more modern than Camp Ipecac and is open year round. Camp Ipecac opens in April and closes in October. Both camps include a mess hall and restrooms. Recreational facilities at the camps include outdoor basketball courts, a beach volleyball court and horseshoes. Charcoal grills are available in the picnic area with picnic tables.

The camps are open only to verifiable organizations of 20 persons or more. Reservations are required.

Local schools and civic organizations are invited to Singletary Lake State Park to take part in a variety of educational opportunities that are led by the park rangers. Classes for educators and middle school students introduce the learner to the ecology of the Carolina Bays.

The Civilian Conservation Corps-Carolina Bay Loop Trail is a one-mile (0.6 km) hiking trail that was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression. It passes by the shore of Singletary Lake and then winds through the forest of bay trees and shrubs and a second forest of longleaf pine and turkey oak.

Singletary Lake is open to recreational boating and fishing. The waters of the lake have a high acidity level due to the amount of vegetation that is decomposing and the buildup peat on the lake bottom. The acid levels have limited the numbers of fish that inhabit the lake and recreation fishing is in turn limited. Yellow perch is one species that thrives in the lake and the fishing of the perch is permitted by the general public when the group camp is not in use. Campers may bring their own boats to launch on the lake as may the general public. All boats are limited to .

<text>South Mountains State Park is a North Carolina state park in Burke County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Connellys Springs, North Carolina, it covers and includes part of the South Mountains, a branch of the Blue Ridge Mountains. High Shoals Falls is the park&#x27;s most visited feature.

==History==
The South Mountains, carved out of the Blue Ridge by erosion, are a broad belt of peaks and knobs rising abruptly from a deep valley. These steep, rugged mountains encompass 100,000 acres (404 km2) in Burke, Cleveland and Rutherford counties.

The Catawba Valley and the gaps across the mountain ranges to the west were once major travel routes. The South Mountains served as a buffer zone between the Cherokee and the Catawba Indians, and the first European settlers in the area farmed the fertile land along the Catawba River.

In 1828, gold was discovered at Brindle Creek. Legend holds that gold flakes and grains were first discovered in the mud used to seal a log cabin. The ensuing gold rush attracted immigrants, mining companies and slave owners. Gold was mined into the early 20th century, but activity in the gold mines eventually declined. Development of land in what is now South Mountains State Park began in the 1930s when Camp Dryer, a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp, was established at Enola. Those employed at the camp constructed forest service roads, cleaned stream beds and built a forest observation tower. The Lower and Upper CCC roads are still in use at the park today.

The park was established as a result of recommendations made by a National Park Service study conducted in coordination with the state of North Carolina. Though proposals for the park began in the 1940s, it was not until 1974 that funds were appropriated to purchase the land. The first land acquisition totaled 5779 (23.39 km2) acres. Additional land has since been added, bringing the park to its present size of 20,949 acres (84.78 km2).

While most of the high points average approximately 2000 feet (609 m) in elevation, Buzzard&#x27;s Roost towers some 3000 feet (914 m) above the surrounding landscape. Elevations within the park itself range from less than 1200 feet (365 m) at points along Jacob&#x27;s Fork River to 3,000 feet (914 m) on Buzzard&#x27;s Roost along the park&#x27;s western boundary.

Water winding through the park to the Catawba River cuts deep into the terrain, forming rugged and steep slopes. A significant feature in the park is High Shoals Falls on Jacob&#x27;s Fork River. Here, a torrent of water drops 80 feet (24 m) over a cliff face of bare rock.

<text>Stone Mountain State Park is a North Carolina state park in Alleghany County and Wilkes County, North Carolina.

==Stone Mountain==



The centerpiece of the park is Stone Mountain, a dome of exposed granite (specifically a quartz diorite to granodiorite) of Devonian age, which has intruded into the gneiss of the Precambrian Alligator Back Formation. It rises sharply over 600 feet (183 m) above the surrounding terrain. The mountain, which has an elevation of 2,305 feet (706 m) above sea level, is known for its barren sides and distinctive brown-gray color, and can be seen for miles. The mountain offers some of the best rock climbing in North Carolina, and the park&#x27;s creeks and streams feature excellent brook trout fishing.

Because the mountain is the best example of a monadnock in massive granite in North Carolina it was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1974.

==Museums and historic site==
The park visitor center features the Mountain Culture Exhibit including mountain settler life and artifacts, and natural history including trout, butterflies and moths.

The mid-19th century Hutchinson Homestead includes a log cabin, barn, blacksmith shop, corncrib, meat house, and original furnishings. The Homestead is open Thursday through Sunday from March – October. The grounds can be visited year round.

The 1897 Garden Creek Baptist Church continues to hold services seasonally. Visitors can walk the grounds when the church is closed.

== Things to do ==
Within the park there are numerous outdoor activities to partake in. The park has established rock climbing, hiking, and camping sites.

<doc id="631401" wikidata="Q7990374" url="?curid=631401" title="Weymouth Woods-Sandhills Nature Preserve">
<text>Weymouth Woods-Sandhills Nature Preserve is a North Carolina state park in Moore County, North Carolina in the United States. Located near Southern Pines, North Carolina, it covers in the Sandhills region of the state. Weymouth Woods is the location of the oldest known longleaf pine tree on record, a tree that was cross-dated at 458 years old.

==Geology==
The unconsolidated sand of the Carolina Sandhills is mapped as the Quaternary Pinehurst Formation, and is interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago.

==Human History==

In the mid-18th century, when Scottish Highlanders settled in the Sandhills region, the vast forest consisted of original growth longleaf pines that reached heights of 100 to . Merchants cut the forests for timber and cultivated choice stands for use as masts for the Royal Navy ships. Merchants also harvested resin from the longleaf pines for the naval stores industry. Resin from longleaf pine yielded four basic products: tar, pitch, turpentine and rosin.

By 1850, North Carolina&#x27;s pine forests were producing one-third of the world&#x27;s supply of naval stores. Resin collected from elongated, inverted V-shaped cuts in the tree trunks was distilled into turpentine. Turpentine was used as a solvent and illuminant. Tar, pitch and rosin were used for sealing the hulls, decks, masts, ropes and riggings of sailing vessels.

When railroads arrived in the Sandhills in the 1870s, large-scale logging and lumbering began. As a result of logging and naval stores operations, most of the virgin growth of longleaf pines had disappeared from the Sandhills by 1900. Many of the older trees that survive today bear prominent scars of this human exploitation.

Early in the 20th century, the grandfather of James Boyd, a well-known North Carolina author, purchased a substantial tract of land east of Southern Pines to save the longleaf pines from logging. He named the estate Weymouth because the pines reminded him of trees in Weymouth, England. In April 1963, Boyd&#x27;s widow, Katharine, donated of land to the state, establishing the first natural area in the North Carolina state parks system. Additional land has been acquired, including a satellite area of known as the Boyd Round Timber Tract, which was added in 1977.

==Ecology==
James Creek, which bisects the preserve, is home to the rare mud sunfish and the sandhills chub, a fish native only to the Sandhills region. The creek is also home to brown bullhead, bluegill, and is nearly at the northernmost terminus for the dollar sunfish. The creek here, like most creeks in the region is described as a blackwater creek, a special environment characteristic of dark, tannin-stained water as well as high acidity, allowing a range of unique species to flourish.

==Weymouth Woods Sandhills Nature Preserve Museum==
The preserve&#x27;s exhibit hall focuses on the natural history of the longleaf pine forest, including geology, plants, animals and the use of prescribed fires to maintain the forest. One exhibit highlights the use of pine resin in the naval stores industry. The museum is located in the park&#x27;s visitor center and is open daily. Naturalists also offer environmental education programs for the public and school groups.

<text>Colatina is the second largest city in the north of Espírito Santo, Brazil, 127 km north of the capital Vitória and on the trainline from Vitória to Minas Gerais. It lies on the banks of the Doce River, through which as much as 700 cubic meters of water per second may flow. Its population was 123,400 (2020 est.) and its area is 1,398 km2.

==History==
The first attempts to colonize the area where Colatina now lies were in 1857. 46 people established themselves in the area, which was easy at first, as land had already been assigned to each family. This proved unsustainable, though, when the Indians attacked the colony and massacred quite a number of people. In 3 years, all of the colonists had left the area, and it would be another 30 years before major influx would start up again. Until then, small advances were made along small river tributaries, which went on until 1925. Only after 1928, after the completion of the bridge over the Doce river, did more stable and sustained growth come to the region.

<text>William B. Umstead State Park is a North Carolina state park in Wake County, North Carolina in the United States. It covers nestled between the expanding cities of Raleigh, Cary, and Durham, North Carolina. It offers hiking, bridle, and bike trails, boat rentals, camping, picnic areas, and educational programs.

Part of the East Coast Greenway, a 3,000 mile long system of trails connecting Maine to Florida, runs through the park.

==History==
Long before the first settlers, the area now known as William B. Umstead State Park was an untamed land. American Bison, elk, bobcats and wolves roamed forests of oak, hickory and beech. Native Americans later inhabited the land and avenues of trade were developed nearby. Such avenues included the Occoneeche trail to the north and the Pee Dee trail to the south. In 1774, land grants opened the area for settlement.

Forests were cleared as agricultural interests sprouted. While early farming efforts were successful, poor cultivation practices and one-crop production led to depletion and erosion of the soil. During the Depression, farmers made futile attempts to grow cotton in worn-out soil around Crabtree Creek.

In 1934, under the Resettlement Administration, federal and state agencies united to buy of this submarginal land to develop a recreation area. The Civilian Conservation Corps, as well as the Works Progress Administration, helped construct the site while providing much needed jobs. Four camps along with day-use and picnic facilities were built and the park opened to the public in 1937.

The state purchased this area, known as Crabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area, for $1, and more facilities were built as the General Assembly made its first state parks division appropriation in the 1940s. In 1950, more than of the park were established as a separate park for African-Americans. This area was named Reedy Creek State Park. Crabtree Creek Recreational Demonstration Area was renamed a few years later after former Governor William Bradley Umstead because of his conservation efforts. In 1966, the Crabtree Creek and Reedy Creek areas were united under the same name; William B. Umstead State Park was open to everyone.

Prior to the purchase of the land for public use, it had historically been used for timberland, as well as a site for several mills along Crabtree Creek. Remnants of milling operations can still be found preserved within the park.

During segregation, the Highway 70 entrance was for whites and the Reedy Creek entrance for blacks. Currently, the Reedy Creek entrance is the main entrance to the park for North Carolina State University. Forestry courses use this entrance to examine the trees native to the park. Additionally, many Raleigh runners use this more private entrance to run in an area of the park that is less frequented by tourist and hiking groups. The only real remnant of this segregation of entrances is the lack of a public road that connects both entrances - vehicles that access the park by one entrance cannot go through the park to the other side.

==Information==
Umstead is bordered by Raleigh-Durham International Airport on the west, Interstate 40 on the south, US 70 on the north, and by the western outskirts of Raleigh on the east. The main bridle and bike trail is Reedy Creek Road, which is open to traffic in western Raleigh (connecting the North Carolina Museum of Art to the park entrance), closed except to rangers&#x27; vehicles as it crosses the park from east to west (a distance of 3.5 miles), and then heads south into Cary where it becomes open to traffic again. At the edge of the park it connects to Black Creek Greenway and the Lake Crabtree County Park trails. Crabtree Creek also flows across Umstead; its source is Lake Crabtree right at the park&#x27;s edge, and it flows eastward throughout much of the southern part of the park (with trails in varying degrees of maintenance along its length) and then crosses Reedy Creek Road to flow north. The main entrances are the two ends of Reedy Creek Road, two entrances off of Ebenezer Church Road in Raleigh near where Crabtree Creek leaves the park, the official Reedy Creek entrance at the end of Cary&#x27;s Harrison Avenue, and the park&#x27;s main entrance at Highway 70 in the north. The latter are equipped with parking lots, bathrooms, and campgrounds; at the Highway 70 entrance there is also a visitors&#x27; center and a campground. Other important bike and bridle trails include Graylyn Road, connecting the Ebenezer Church entrance to Reedy Creek Road, and Turkey Creek Road, which winds through the northern part of the park; hiking trails include the Company Mill trail in the south and the Sycamore Trail in the north, both of which are loops of moderate difficulty, as well as many others. Bikes and horses are prohibited on hiking trails.

Umstead is part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. The topography is hilly, and it has several artificial lakes (which are very common in Wake County, partially due to a flood control plan implemented over the last half-century).
==Piedmont Beech Natural Area==
Is a National Natural Landmark located inside the park, which protects a mixed mesophytic forest and maturing stands of beech trees. The natural area was designated in 1974. Access to the area is allowed only by special permit.

<doc id="631406" wikidata="Q1017183" url="?curid=631406" title="Erigavo">
<text>Erigavo (, ), also spelled as Erigabo, is the capital and largest city of the Sanaag region of Somaliland.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Ceerigaabo&quot; is made up of two parts: &quot;Ceeri&quot; which describes a place water collects, and &quot;gaabo&quot; (&quot;gaaban&quot;), meaning short or low. &quot;Ceeri&quot; can also be an abbreviation of &quot;ceeriyaan&quot;, the Somali word for mist/fog. The name &quot;Ceerigaabo&quot; may refer to low-hanging mist covering the city.

==History==
The Erigavo settlement is several centuries old. The surrounding area was supposedly built by the Madigan Dir. Modern Erigavo was founded by the Musa Ismail sub-clan of the Habr Yunis as a home well for passing nomads and caravans. The general area is noted for its numerous historical tombs, where various Somali clan patriarchs are buried.

===1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion===

The 1945 Sheikh Bashir Rebellion was a rebellion waged by tribesmen of the Habr Je&#x27;lo clan in the cities of Burao and Erigavo in the former British Somaliland protectorate against British authorities in July 1945 led by Sheikh Bashir, a Somali religious leader.

On July the 2nd, Sheikh Bashir collected 25 of his followers in the town of Wadamago and transported them on a lorry to the vicinity of Burao, where he distributed arms to half of his followers. On the evening of July the 3rd the group entered Burao and opened fire on the police guard of the central prison in the city, which was filled with prisoners arrested for previous demonstrations. The group also attacked the house of the district commissioner of Burao District, Major Chambers, resulting in the death of Major Chamber&#x27;s police guard before escaping to Bur Dhab, a strategic mountain south-east of Burao, where Sheikh Bashir&#x27;s small unit occupied a fort and took up a defensive position in anticipation of a British counterattack.

The British campaign against Sheikh Bashir&#x27;s troops proved abortive after several defeats as his forces kept moving from place to place and avoiding any permanent location. No sooner had the expedition left the area, than the news traveled fast among the Somali nomads across the plain. The war had exposed the British administration to humiliation. The government came to a conclusion that another expedition against him would be useless; that they must build a railway, make roads and effectively occupy the whole of the protectorate, or else abandon the interior completely. The latter course was decided upon, and during the first months of 1945, the advance posts were withdrawn and the British administration confined to the coast town of Berbera.

Sheikh Bashir solved many disputes among the tribes in the vicinity, which kept them from raiding each other. He was generally thought to settle disputes through the use of Islamic Sharia and gathered around him a strong following.

Sheikh Bashir sent a message to religious figures in the town of Erigavo and called on them to revolt and join the rebellion he led. The religious leaders as well as the people of Erigavo heeded his call, and mobilized a substantial number of people in Erigavo armed with rifles and spears and staged a revolt. The British authorities responded rapidly and severely, sending reinforcements to the town and opening fire on the armed mobs in two &quot;local actions&quot; as well as arresting minor religious leaders in the town.

The British administration recruited Indian and South African troops, led by police general James David, to fight against Sheikh Bashir and had intelligence plans to capture him alive. The British authorities mobilized a police force, and eventually on 7 July found Sheikh Bashir and his unit in defensive positions behind their fortifications in the mountains of Bur Dhab. After clashes Sheikh Bashir and his second-in-command, Alin Yusuf Ali, nicknamed Qaybdiid, were killed. A third rebel was wounded and was captured along with two other rebels. The rest fled the fortifications and dispersed. On the British side the police general leading the British troops as well as a number of Indian and South African troops perished in the clashes, and a policeman was injured.

Despite the death of Sheikh Bashir and his followers resistance against British authorities continued in Somaliland, especially in Erigavo where his death stirred further resistance in the town and the town of Badhan and lead to attacks on British colonial troops throughout the district and the seizing of arms from the rural constabulary.

===Recent events===
In May 2024, a rebellion broke out in Erigavo. Unable to put down the incident with local police alone, the 3rd Division of the National Army assisted and over the course of three nights put down it. More than 50 youths were arrested. Sanaag Regional Governor Ahmed Abdi Muse warned that the arrested youths would be brought to justice, but that their parents should not complain.

==Geography==

===Environment===

 to the north of the town are the remains of a juniper forest, running along the edge of the escarpment overlooking the Gulf of Aden. The escarpment is approximately above sea level, where the road from Erigavo drops down to the coast. to the west, it rises to the highest point in Somaliland, Shimbiris. A popular local attraction, the summit sits at an elevation of about above sea level. A road also leads up from Erigavo to Daallo mountain. At the mountain&#x27;s peak, the sea can be observed in addition to the ancient town of Hiis situated nearby.

Erigavo is also home to many animal and plant species. Wildlife native to the area include leopard, spotted hyena, striped hyena, black-backed jackal, gerenuk, hamadryas baboon, desert warthog, honey badger, Somali ostrich and the Warsangli linnet.
===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Erigavo features a mild version of the semi-arid climate. The city generally sees equable temperatures year round, with some of the mildest weather in all of Somaliland. Despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude, temperatures rarely exceed . Nights are frequently cool during the summer season and cold during the winter. This is a trait shared with very few places in the world; notable locations with similar climate are Sana&#x27;a in Yemen or Arequipa in Peru. The city receives on average under of rain annually. Average monthly temperatures range from in the month of December to in the month of July. Absolute minimum temperatures sometimes touch or cross .

==Demographics==
In 1997, Matt Bryden said the majority of the population is Habr Yunis and the Habr Je&#x27;lo clans of the Isaaq.

In 2009, Photographer &amp; Educator Chantal Heijnen said that Erigavo has an estimated population of 180,000. 

In 2013, the &quot;Observatory of Conflict and Violence Prevention&quot; reported that Erigavo has a population of about 30,000, and that there are four main clans living there, Habr Je&#x27;lo, Habar Yoonis, Warsangali, and Dhulbahante, with a small number of other clans.

==Education==
Higher learning in Erigavo is provided by East Africa University (EAU), which has one of its six branches in the city. The Sanaag University also offers tertiary courses and degrees, and Gollis university has a branch and many colleges. Queen of Sheba University offers women in Sanaag free degree courses and a limited number of places worldwide in distance mode.

<text>Charles Pratt (October 2, 1830 – May 4, 1891) was an American businessman. Pratt was a pioneer of the U.S. petroleum industry, and he established his kerosene refinery Astral Oil Works in Brooklyn, New York. He then lived with his growing family in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. He recruited Henry H. Rogers into his business, forming Charles Pratt and Company in 1867. Seven years later, Pratt and Rogers agreed to join John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s Standard Oil.

An advocate of education, Pratt founded and endowed the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, now a renowned art college. He and his children built country estates in Glen Cove, New York, which became known as the Gold Coast in the 1920s on the North Shore of Long Island. In 1916, Standard Oil had a steamship tanker, the first of its class, built at Newport News, Virginia, and it was named in honor of Pratt.

==Early life and education==
Charles Pratt was born in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, US, as one of eleven children. He was the son of Elizabeth Stone and Asa Pratt, a carpenter. He spent three winters as a student at Wesleyan Academy, Wilbraham (now Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy).

==Career==

===Whale oil, petroleum, Astral Oil===
As a young man, Pratt joined a company in nearby Boston, Massachusetts, that specialized in paints and whale oil products. In 1850 or 1851, he moved to New York City, where he worked for a similar company. Pratt realized that whale oil could be replaced by petroleum (&quot;natural oil&quot;) distillates to light lamps. He became a pioneer of the petroleum industry as new wells were established during the 1860s in western Pennsylvania. In the 1860s, he founded his kerosene refinery, Astral Oil Works, in Brooklyn, New York. One advertising slogan was &quot;The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil.&quot;

===Henry H. Rogers, Charles Pratt and Company===
Pratt and his future business partner Henry H. Rogers became acquainted while doing business in the oil fields of Pennsylvania. In the mid-1860s, Pratt met two young men, Charles Ellis and Rogers, in the area of the new oil fields of Venango County in western Pennsylvania. Previously, Pratt had bought whale oil from Ellis in Fairhaven, Massachusetts, his and Rogers&#x27; coastal hometown. They struck a deal and pre-sold the entire output of their small venture, Wamsutta Oil Refinery, to Pratt&#x27;s company at a fixed price. But, Ellis and Rogers soon were heavily in debt to Pratt. Ellis gave up, but in 1866, Rogers went to Pratt in New York City to say he would take personal responsibility for the entire debt. Impressed, Pratt immediately hired Rogers for his own organization. After five years in the oil fields, in 1866 Pratt asked Rogers to come to the Brooklyn side of the business, where Rogers worked for the next eight years. Pratt made Rogers foreman of his Brooklyn refinery, with a promise of a partnership if sales ran over $50,000 annually.

In 1867, with Rogers as a partner, Pratt established the firm of Charles Pratt and Company. According to Elbert Hubbard, a journalist, in the next few years Rogers became Pratt&#x27;s &quot;hands and feet and eyes and ears.&quot; In 1867, Pratt built &quot;America&#x27;s first modern oil refinery (Astral Oil) on the banks of Newtown Creek,&quot; In 1869, Pratt trademarked &quot;Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil&quot;.

===Standard Oil associations===
In the early 1870s, Pratt and Rogers became involved in conflicts with John D. Rockefeller&#x27;s South Improvement Company. Rockefeller had obtained favorable net rates from the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and other railroads through a secret system of rebates. His actions outraged independent oil producers and refineries in western Pennsylvania and other areas. The New York interests formed an association, and about the middle of March 1872, sent a committee of three, with Rogers as head, to Oil City, Pennsylvania to consult with the Oil Producers&#x27; Union. Working with the Pennsylvania independents, Rogers and his associates forged an agreement with the PRR and other railroads; the railroads eventually agreed to open rates to all and promised to end their special dealings with South Improvement. The oil men felt victorious, but Rockefeller had already begun to buy up opposing interests in the formation of Standard Oil.


A short time later, Rockefeller approached Charles Pratt with plans for cooperation and consolidation. Pratt and Rogers decided that the plan would benefit their business plans. Rogers formulated terms which guaranteed financial security and jobs for Pratt and him, which Rockefeller accepted. Charles Pratt and Company (including Astral Oil) became one of the important former independent refiners to join Rockefeller&#x27;s organization, becoming part of Standard Oil Trust in 1874. However, the fact that Astral Oil was a New York branch of Standard Oil in Ohio was not made public until 1892. When the Rockefellers absorbed the Pratt interests in 1874, Pratt and Rockefeller in 1874 began to buy competing refineries in Brooklyn under the Pratt name. They succeeded in driving a number of smaller firms out of business. Around this time, the coopers&#x27; union opposed Pratt&#x27;s efforts to cut back on certain manual operations, as they were the craftsmen who made the barrels that held the oil. Pratt busted the union, and his strategies for breaking up the organization were adopted by other refineries.

===Later ventures===
Astral Oil suffered several fires in the 1870s and 1880s. On January 26, 1873, Pratt&#x27;s Astral Oil-works in Williamsburg caught fire. At the time, about 250 boys and adult men were employed by Pratt. No deaths were reported with the fire. There was also a December 21, 1884 fire at the Brooklyn Astral refinery. According to Pratt, much of the damages were insured.

Although the merger with Rockefeller made Pratt a wealthy man, as a member of the board of directors of Standard Oil, he maintained his independence and frequently criticized Rockefeller. With Pratt&#x27;s death in 1891, Rockefeller&#x27;s position as the most powerful man in the oil industry, already well established, became unassailable. Pratt&#x27;s family were involved with his business ventures and with Standard Oil. His eldest son, Charles Millard Pratt (1855–1935), became Secretary of Standard Oil. In 1923 his son Herbert Lee Pratt rose to become head of Standard Oil of New York.

==Philanthropy==
Charles Pratt is credited with recognizing the growing need for trained industrial workers in a changing economy. In 1886, he founded and endowed the Pratt Institute, which opened in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn in 1887. Originally a technical institute, it has become a renowned art, design and architectural college. In 1910, Pratt also endowed the construction of the Pratt School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was an organizing member of the Emmanuel Baptist Church, a prominent and extant congregation near Pratt Institute worshiping in the 1887 edifice supported by Pratt and today known as perhaps the finest extant 19th Century church interior in New York City.

==Personal life==

Charles Pratt worked first in Boston, then moved to New York in 1850–1851. Soon after getting established in New York, in 1854 he married Lydia Ann Richardson (1835–1861). They had two children: Charles Millard Pratt (1855–1935) and Lydia Richardson Pratt (1857–1904) (who married Frank Lusk Babbott). Lydia died young in 1861. 
The widower Pratt married her younger sister Mary Helen Richardson in September 1863. They had six children together: Frederic B. Pratt (1865–1945), Helen Pratt (1867–1949), George Dupont Pratt (1869–1935), Herbert L. Pratt (1871–1945), John Teele Pratt (1873–1927), and Harold I. Pratt (1877–1939).
Pratt moved to a country home in Glen Cove, New York, about 1890. To provide for his children, he purchased large tracts of land surrounding his estate, totaling 1,100 acres (4.5 km2). He died the next year, aged 60, in New York City. Each of the sons developed an individual estate in Glen Cove. 
Other notable Pratt descendants include:
* Andy Pratt (born 1947 in Boston), a great-grandson who is a singer-songwriter. His father Edwin H Baker Pratt was headmaster of the school Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols.
* Sherman Pratt (1900–1964), grandson of Charles Pratt and son of George Dupont Pratt. Founder of Marineland of Florida
* Richardson J. Pratt &#x27;Jerry&#x27; (1923–2001), great-grandson of Charles Pratt and grandson of Charles Millard Pratt. Was President of Pratt Institute (1972–1990)
* Suzanna Love (1950–), great-granddaughter of Charles Pratt and granddaughter of John Teele Pratt. Former actress.
* John Sherman Register (1939-1996), realist painter.

==Legacy and honors==
===Long Island mansions===

After his death, Charles Pratt&#x27;s six sons and two daughters later built their own family estates in Glen Cove. As of 2004, most of the extant Pratt family Gold Coast Mansions are still in use:

* Welwyn, originally the estate of Harold I. Pratt, is owned by and operated as the Welwyn Preserve, a Nassau County park; the house is now adapted as the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County. 
* The Braes, initially owned by Herbert L. Pratt, is now used as the Webb Institute of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering.
* The Manor, built for John Teele Pratt, is now the Glen Cove Mansion Hotel &amp; Conference Center.
* Poplar Hill, the Frederic B. Pratt residence, is now the Glengariff Healthcare Center, housing both Glengariff (a long-term nursing care facility) and the Pratt Pavilion for Nursing and Rehabilitation (a state-of-the-art, short-term, sub-acute rehabilitation center).
* Killenworth, originally the home of George Dupont Pratt, has been (since the mid-20th century) the country retreat for the Russian delegation to the United Nations.

===Pratt Cemetery===
With so many Pratt family members in Glen Cove, they had a cemetery built for themselves on their property. Known as &quot;Pratt Cemetery&quot;, behind ornate gates and up a winding drive stands a pink granite Romanesque mausoleum designed by William Tubby, as well as a crypt and a tower connected by a &quot;bridge of sighs&quot;. Charles Pratt is interred in a sarcophagus here, as are seven out of his eight children, and many of his grandchildren.

===Pratt, West Virginia===
The town of Pratt, West Virginia (previously known as Clinton) was renamed Pratt in 1905, after the owner of the Charles Pratt Coal Company.

===Steamship tanker S.S. &quot;Charles Pratt&quot;===
In March 1916, Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company launched the S.S. &quot;Charles Pratt&quot;, a tanker of 8,807 tons with a capacity of of oil. It became the first ship of the &quot;Pratt&quot; class, and was joined by the S.S. &quot;H.H. Rogers&quot; in May 1916.

After 1939, both ships were operated by Panama Transport Co., a subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey. At the beginning of World War II, on December 21, 1940, the S.S. &quot;Charles Pratt&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Africa while &quot;en route&quot; from Aruba to Freetown, Sierra Leone. Of the American crew of 42, only two men died.

<text>Molly Shannon (born September 16, 1964) is an American actress and comedian. She was a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1995 to 2001. In 2017, she won the Film Independent Spirit Award for playing Joanne Mulcahey in the Chris Kelly autobiographical film &quot;Other People&quot;.

Shannon appeared in supporting roles in several films, including &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998), &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; (1999), &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000), &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; (2001), &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot; (2001), &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (2003), &quot;Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby&quot; (2006), &quot;More of Me&quot; (2007), &quot;Evan Almighty&quot; (2007), and &quot;Me and Earl and the Dying Girl&quot; (2015).

== Early life ==
Shannon was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on September 16, 1964, to an Irish-American Catholic family. Her maternal grandparents were born in Ireland, with her grandfather being from Cloghmore, Achill, Mayo. When Molly was four years old, she and her older sister survived when their drunk driving father caused a car crash that killed her mother, younger sister, and a cousin; she and her sister were raised by an aunt while their father went through a lengthy recovery from his self-inflicted injuries.

Shannon attended St. Dominic School in Shaker Heights for grade school, and Hawken School in Gates Mills, Ohio. She attended New York University, where she studied drama and graduated from NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in 1987.

== Career ==
Before &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Shannon worked as a hostess at Cravings restaurant on Sunset Boulevard and as a food demo girl at Gelson&#x27;s super market in Marina Del Rey. She auditioned for her first big film role and was cast, playing the supporting part of Meg in the 1989 horror film remake of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, with Robert Englund. In 1991, she had a brief appearance in the second season of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; as &quot;the happy helping hand lady&quot;, and in 1993, she appeared with minor roles in three episodes of &quot;In Living Color&quot;, the first in a fake TV commercial with Shawn Wayans playing Chris Rock, the second in a sketch with Jim Carrey, playing LAPD Sergeant Stacey Koon, and third being a parody of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Shannon&#x27;s major break came in February 1995, when she was hired as a featured player on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to replace Janeane Garofalo after Garofalo left mid-season, reason being that the experience left her &quot;anxious and depressed&quot;, and that she believed a sexist attitude pervaded the show. Shannon was one of the few cast members to be kept (along with David Spade, Norm Macdonald, Mark McKinney and Tim Meadows) when Lorne Michaels overhauled his cast and writers for season 21 (1995–96).

She appeared in a 1997 episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; titled &quot;The Summer of George&quot;, where she played Sam, the co-worker who drove Elaine Benes crazy because she did not swing her arms while walking. She appeared in Sheryl Crow&#x27;s video for the song &quot;A Change (Will Do You Good)&quot; and played the recurring role of loony neighbor Val Bassett, Grace Adler&#x27;s nemesis, on &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, appearing in five episodes over the sitcom&#x27;s eight-season run. In 1998, she played the role of Emily Sanderson in the film &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;, featuring Will Ferrell and Chris Kattan who were also cast members of &quot;SNL&quot; at the time. She appeared in &quot;Sex and the City&quot; in a number of episodes.

In 1999, Shannon starred in &quot;Superstar&quot;, a feature film based on her &quot;SNL&quot; character, Mary Katherine Gallagher, the awkward Catholic school student who aspires to be a musical superstar.

During her run on SNL, Shannon starred in the film &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot; (1999), &quot;How The Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; (2000), &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot; (2001) and &quot;Serendipity&quot; (2001). Shannon left &quot;SNL&quot; in 2001. In 2003, she appeared in the romantic comedy &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and the television remake of &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

In 2004, she starred in a short-lived Fox network television series &quot;Cracking Up&quot;. That same year, she guest starred in an episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot; and starred as Mrs. Baker in the film &quot;Good Boy!&quot; In 2006, Shannon was featured in the Sofia Coppola-directed movie &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; as Aunt Victoire. The next year, Shannon guest-starred on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;Evan Almighty&quot;. Shannon made a move to drama, appearing in Mike White&#x27;s film &quot;Year of the Dog&quot; in 2007. In 2013, Shannon joined White again, playing his love interest Eileen in the HBO show &quot;Enlightened&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Emmy for outstanding guest actress.

Shannon hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on May 12, 2007, making her the second former female cast member to host (after Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and the first one to have been a cast member for Lorne Michaels (Louis-Dreyfus was a cast member under Dick Ebersol).

In 2008, Shannon starred as Kath in the American version of the Australian sitcom &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;.

In early 2010, Shannon was cast in a recurring role on the Fox television series &quot;Glee&quot; as Brenda Castle, an astronomy and badminton teacher who has a rivalry with main character Sue Sylvester.

She returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for a special Mother&#x27;s Day episode on May 8, 2010, and the October 2010 reunion special &quot;Women of SNL&quot;.

Shannon replaced Katie Finneran in the role of Marge McDougall in the Broadway revival of &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; on October 12, 2010, and remained through its closure on January 2, 2011, along with co-stars Sean Hayes and Kristin Chenoweth.

Shannon&#x27;s first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Tilly the Trickster&quot;, was released September 1, 2011.

As of spring 2012, she has replaced Pauley Perrette as the spokesperson for Expedia.

In 2015, Shannon starred in the Sundance premiere of &quot;Me and Earl and the Dying Girl&quot; directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. She was a guest, along with Denis Leary, on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; on June 9, 2015.

In 2016, Shannon co-starred in the HBO comedy &quot;Divorce&quot; opposite Sarah Jessica Parker and Thomas Haden Church.

Shannon won the 2017 Film Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the highly acclaimed drama, &quot;Other People&quot;. She had two films premiere at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival: &quot;The Little Hours&quot; and &quot;Fun Mom Dinner&quot;.

In 2018, Shannon co-hosted the Rose Parade with Will Ferrell on Amazon Prime Video in character as fictional local television personalities, Tish and Cord. In 2018, Shannon and Ferrell co-hosted HBO&#x27;s broadcast of the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle as their characters Tish and Cord.

In 2018, Shannon co-starred in the critically acclaimed Netflix film &quot;Private Life&quot;, playing prickly Cynthia.

In 2022, Shannon released &quot;Hello, Molly!: A Memoir&quot; ().

In 2022, Shannon co-starred in the Showtime comedy television series &quot;I Love That for You&quot; alongside fellow former &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alum Vanessa Bayer.

In 2024, it was announced Shannon would join the upcoming fourth season of the Hulu comedy series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; in a recurring role.

<text>In cryptography, the Generalized DES Scheme (GDES or G-DES) is a variant of the DES symmetric-key block cipher designed with the intention of speeding up the encryption process while improving its security. The scheme was proposed by Ingrid Schaumuller-Bichl in 1981.

In 1990, Eli Biham and Adi Shamir showed that GDES was vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis, and that any GDES variant faster than DES is also less secure than DES.

GDES generalizes the Feistel network structure of DES to larger block sizes. In each round, the DES round function is applied to the rightmost 32-bit subblock, and the result is XORed with all the other parts. Then the block is rotated 32 bits to the right.

<text>Matthew Gordon Bullard (born June 5, 1967) is an American former professional basketball player in the NBA and former color analyst for the Houston Rockets on AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest. Bullard played 12 years professionally and 11 years in the NBA, most notably with the Houston Rockets from 1990 to 1994, and then again from 1996 to 2001. Other teams he played for include the Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, and PAOK in Greece.

==Early life==
Matt Bullard went to Valley High School in West Des Moines, Iowa. He went undrafted after graduating from the University of Iowa in 1990.

==Professional career==
Bullard played nine seasons with the Houston Rockets (1990–94, 1996–2001) and one season each with both the Atlanta Hawks (1995–96) and the Charlotte Hornets (2001–02). He also played in the 1994–95 season for the Greek League power PAOK. He has career averages of 5.3 points and two rebounds per game. He was known affectionately in Houston as &quot;Air Bullard&quot; in part for his ability to get extreme height on his three-point shots (due to his height at 2.08 m, 6 ft 10 in) and partly as good-natured ribbing about his poor vertical jump, but Bullard was also a fan favorite and an essential part to Houston&#x27;s first championship in 1994.

==Post–basketball life==
In 2004, Bullard lost to Dee Brown on the ESPN reality television program &quot;Dream Job&quot; in the finals as they competed for a coveted sports analyst position on the sports network. When asked about losing to Dee Brown, Bullard remarked &quot;at least it wasn&#x27;t Pete Chilcutt&quot;. He and Clyde Drexler shared color commentating duties for local Houston Rockets game telecasts alongside long-time play-by-play man Bill Worrell. On June 2, 2021, Bullard announced that his tenure with AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest was done and he would not be part of its broadcast lineup for the 2021-22 NBA season.

<text>Pērkons () is a Latvian rock band formed in 1981. The band consisted of Juris Kulakovs (keyboard, compositions), Juris Sējāns (bass, vocals), Leons Sējāns (lead guitar), Ieva Akurātere (vocals), Raimonds Bartaševics (vocals), and Ikars Ruņģis (drums).

Pērkons often played both instrumental classical music and rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll or hard rock; but, they were better known for playing the latter. In 1983, the band was banned by the Soviet government. However, they renamed and continued to play as the Ensemble of the Soviet Latvia Collective Farm. In 1985, after a concert in Ogre, a group of teenagers demolished two train compartments, resulting in the group being banned again, despite the band not being involved. The incident was documented by Juris Podnieks in the film &quot;Is It Easy to Be Young?&quot; 

In 1987, they played at the music festival Liepājas dzintars () as the official band of a rural fishermen&#x27;s kolkhoz.

The lyrics of their music were mostly written by Māris Melgalvs, and were seen as rebellious, especially for the time. One of their best-known songs is Balāde par gulbi. The group has also performed &quot;Songs of Fredman&quot; by the Swedish 18th century song-poet Carl Michael Bellman.

Kulakovs died in 2024, which Juris Sējāns confirmed on February 12th.

<text>Hiking in the Natal Drakensberg is a popular activity for experienced locals and visitors to South Africa. The escarpment allows one to hike on a cliff of roughly 1000m high that stretches for 240 km from Sentinel Buttress in the North to Bushman&#x27;s Neck Didima camp in the South. Hiking is however not recommended for inexperienced hikers as conditions can change quickly and harsh weather can occur for extended periods.

KZN (KwaZulu-Natal) Wildlife distributes 6 1:50,000 maps that can be used while hiking in the Drakensberg. The maps use the Cape datum as the geodesic reference. GPS users should be careful to use the correct datum as WGS 84 is not always the default. Some GPS waypoints for the Drakensberg are listed below:

<text>Unto These Hills is an outdoor historical drama during summers at the 2,800-seat Mountainside Theatre in Cherokee, North Carolina. It is the third oldest outdoor historical drama in the United States, after &quot;The Lost Colony&quot; in Manteo in eastern North Carolina and &quot;The Ramona Pageant&quot; in Southern California. The first version of the play was written by Kermit Hunter and opened on July 1, 1950, to wide acclaim.

The play recounts the history of the Cherokee of the Eastern region up to their removal by United States forces in 1838 via the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. The drama includes notable Cherokee historic figures, including Sequoyah, Junaluska, Chief Yonaguska a.k.a. Drowning Bear, and William Holland Thomas.

== History ==
The Western North Carolina Associated Communities (WNCAC) in western North Carolina wanted to develop tourism and promote economic growth in the western part of the state. Inspired by the success of Paul Green&#x27;s historic outdoor drama, or political pageant, &quot;The Lost Colony&quot;, the WNCAC decided to make another political pageant about the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) in Cherokee, North Carolina. When Paul Green was unavailable to write a second play, they commissioned UNC graduate student Kermit Hunter to write the new outdoor drama. With the help of Joe Jennings, director Samuel Selden chose the EBCI&#x27;s homeland of Cherokee, North Carolina, as the backdrop for the drama. The Mountainside Theatre was built for this outdoor drama. The play was first produced on July 1, 1950. It was immediately successful with more than 100,000 audience members in its first year of production.

The play has run for more than 70 years at the Mountainside Theatre, which is owned and operated by the Cherokee Historical Association. It is staged Monday through Saturday evenings.

Famous alumni of &quot;Unto These Hills&quot; include Michael Rosenbaum, best known for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on &quot;Smallville&quot;; Adam Richman, host of Travel Channel&#x27;s &quot;Man v. Food&quot;; Polly Holliday, of the 1970s sitcom &quot;Alice&quot;; and actor and former U.S. Representative Ben L. Jones of Georgia, a regular on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

In 2006, the EBCI Tribal Government hired playwright Hanay Geiogamah (Kiowa) to revise the script, the first complete rewrite since the play was instituted. Geiogamah is a writer/director/producer of Native American dramas, as well as the founder of the American Indian Dance Theatre and Professor in the Department of Theater at the University of California, Los Angeles. Geiogamah was chosen to address a number of issues with the previous script, including historical inaccuracies. He was also encouraged to increase Cherokee tribal participation in the cast. Geiogamah accepted this challenge, wrote a new script, and produced a show. But many tribal members were reportedly not fond of the new play version, saying that it removed the Cherokee style of story telling and their history in this area. Geiogamah had added more interpretive dance to help convey the story. In addition, many tribal members missed having the story of Tsali included in the play. He is believed to have sacrificed his life in battle to gain approval for the remainder of his Cherokee people to stay in their homeland of North Carolina, at a time of conflict with European Americans.

In 2007, the tribe hired Pat Allee and Ben Hurst to write a new script. In 2008, additional changes were made by Linda West. Fewer than 50,000 people saw the performance in summer 2009, about half the number from years ago. John Tissue, director of the Cherokee Historical Association, suggests economic problems as the reason for the reduced crowds. The 2010 production is credited to Linda Squirrel. Eddie Swimmer, a Cherokee, serves as director of the drama. As of 2010, more than six million people have seen the production.

In 2015, it was announced that the original Kermit Hunter script from 1950 would be brought out of retirement. Several changes were made to make the original script more historically accurate. Many attendees have been well pleased to see the original version of the show.

In 2020, the production announced that the 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was the first time the drama did not have a production season. The drama returned to their normal operating schedule in May 2021.

=== Sequel ===
The Cherokee Nation hired Hunter to write a sequel, &quot;The Trail of Tears&quot;, covering the period during and after the removal to Indian Territory in what became the state of Oklahoma. That drama was performed at a large outdoor amphitheater at the Cherokee Heritage Center (then known as Tsa-La-Gi), from 1969 through 2005.

<doc id="631443" wikidata="Q1481983" url="?curid=631443" title="Seismic moment">
<text>Seismic moment is a quantity used by seismologists to measure the size of an earthquake. The scalar seismic moment formula_1 is defined by the equation
formula_2, where
*formula_3 is the shear modulus of the rocks involved in the earthquake (in pascals (Pa), i.e. newtons per square meter)
*formula_4 is the area of the rupture along the geologic fault where the earthquake occurred (in square meters), and
*formula_5 is the average slip (displacement offset between the two sides of the fault) on formula_4 (in meters).

formula_1 thus has dimensions of torque, measured in newton meters. The connection between seismic moment and a torque is natural in the body-force equivalent representation of seismic sources as a double-couple (a pair of force couples with opposite torques): the seismic moment is the torque of each of the two couples. Despite having the same dimensions as energy, seismic moment is not a measure of energy. The relations between seismic moment, potential energy drop and radiated energy are indirect and approximative.

The seismic moment of an earthquake is typically estimated using whatever information is available to constrain its factors. For modern earthquakes, moment is usually estimated from ground motion recordings of earthquakes known as seismograms. For earthquakes that occurred in times before modern instruments were available, moment may be estimated from geologic estimates of the size of the fault rupture and the slip.

Seismic moment is the basis of the moment magnitude scale introduced by Caltech&#x27;s Thomas C. Hanks and Hiroo Kanamori, which is often used to compare the size of different earthquakes and is especially useful for comparing the sizes of large (great) earthquakes.

The seismic moment is not restricted to earthquakes. For a more general seismic source described by a seismic moment tensor formula_8 (a symmetric tensor, but not necessarily a double couple tensor), the seismic moment is

:formula_9

<doc id="631445" wikidata="Q3614053" url="?curid=631445" title="American Conservative Union">
<text>The American Conservative Union (ACU) is an American political organization that advocates for conservative policies, ranks politicians based on their level of conservatism, and organizes the Conservative Political Action Conference. Founded on December 18, 1964, it calls itself the oldest ongoing conservative lobbying organization in the U.S. The ACU is concerned with issues such as personal liberty or freedom, and traditional values, which they define as foundations of conservatism.

== Activities ==
The ACU comprises three entities: The American Conservative Union, a 501(c)(4) organization which conducts lobbying; The American Conservative Union Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization best known for hosting the Conservative Political Action Conference; and The American Conservative Union Political Action Committee, a PAC that formally endorses and funds conservative candidates for federal and state level offices.

=== Congressional ratings ===
Dating back to 1971, ACU has implemented its own scoring system which annually rates politicians on their conservatism. While the scorecard was novel to conservatism, Americans for Democratic Action has utilized a liberal rubric for liberalism since 1947.

Each publication of Congressional and State Ratings contains a statement from Chairman Matt Schlapp about the philosophy guiding the ratings as one of conservatism: &quot;We begin with our philosophy (conservatism is the political philosophy that sovereignty resides in the person) and then apply our understanding of government (its essential role is to defend life, liberty, and property).&quot;

Unlike other congressional ratings that take positions on pending legislation, ACU Foundation rates votes already cast by lawmakers. Each rating provides a conservative interpretation of an official&#x27;s view of governance. As one spokesperson for the ACU once noted, &quot;clear-cut distinctions between liberals and conservatives [occur] if you have Crane, Ashbrook, and Kemp go a certain way and Burton goes the other&quot;.

The ACU annually rates politicians according to how they vote on key issues, providing a numerical indicator of how much the lawmakers agreed with conservative ideals. They use this rating system as a point of accountability for politicians, comparing their political rhetoric to their voting records to assess their conservativeness. Politicians are given a percentile rating, anyone with a rating of over 80% is considered to be an &quot;ACU Conservative&quot;. These scores are often used in political science research, in news stories and in election campaigns.

=== Conservative Political Action Conference ===

ACU&#x27;s most well-known event is the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual event organized by the ACU foundation. CPAC has an annual attendance of thousands. Speakers regularly include sitting and former presidents and other famous conservatives. CPAC 2017 featured President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), Governors Matt Bevin (R-KY), Sam Brownback (R-KS), Doug Ducey (R-AZ), and Scott Walker (R-WI) and executive branch officials (EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos).

=== American Conservative Union Foundation ===
The ACU Foundation&#x27;s purpose is to educate the public on conservative principles and currently has five &quot;policy centers&quot; which focus on different political areas. There is the Center for Arts and Culture, the Center for Human Dignity, the Center for Statesmanship &amp; Diplomacy, the Center for 21st Century Property Rights, and the Center for Criminal Justice Reform (CCJR). These policy centers are mainly blogs which post articles regarding their topic area. The most extensive of these is the CCJR, who advocate for conservative criminal justice reform through advising governmental officials, media advocacy, and testifying as expert witnesses at governmental hearings. The CCJR focuses on two main policy areas: preventing civil asset forfeiture and increasing mental health facilities within the criminal justice system. The CCJR works with the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Prison Fellow Ministries in the Right on Crime campaign, and offers a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference each year.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The American Conservative Union was one of many conservative organizations formed in the 1960s as part of the resurgence of conservatism. As conservative activist M. Stanton Evans predicted, &quot;Historians may well record the decade of the 1960s as the era in which conservatism, as a viable political force, finally came into its own.&quot; During a time of increasing polarization between liberals and conservatives, activists began to build a well-organized conservative movement, forming organizations such as Young Americans for Freedom and the ACU. During this era, conservative groups focused less on direct action and more on long term planning and sought to gain positions in public office.

The ACU was founded in December 1964 in response to the predominance of liberalism in America as evidenced by the defeat of Barry Goldwater&#x27;s presidential campaign. Founders included Frank S. Meyer, William F Buckley Jr, and Robert E. Bauman, who organized the first meeting. In the initial meetings, a 50-member board of directors was appointed, whose members included Lammot Copeland, Peter O&#x27;Donnell, John A. Howard, Donald C. Bruce, and John Dos Passos. Membership grew to 7,000 within 9 months, and 45,000 by the end of 1972.

As part of ACU&#x27;s mission to unite conservatives, William F. Buckley and Robert Bauman led an initiative to declare ACU&#x27;s views of the John Birch Society. ACU&#x27;s founding documents state that, 

Conservatives&#x27; view of the Birchers became a national storyline when Buckley continued to criticize the Birchers in his &quot;National Review&quot; column.

=== Foreign policy influence ===
The ACU spent roughly $1.4 million opposing the ratification of the Panama Canal treaties in 1977. They used a mass mailing campaign, sending out around 2.4 million letters. This brought in roughly $15,000 a day in support of conservative candidates who opposed the treaties. They also produced a thirty-minute-long television ad which aired on 150 television station in eighteen states, and took out newspaper ads in thirty states, encouraging citizens to write to their senators to oppose the treaties. The ACU also helped to fund a &quot;truth squad,&quot; formed by Senator Paul Laxalt, whose purpose was to &quot;focus renewed public interest in the treaties&quot; and pressure senators to vote against the treaties. Gary Jarmin, who was at the time Legislator of the ACU, stated that the Panama Canal Treaties were &quot;a good issue for the conservative movement. It&#x27;s not just the issue itself we&#x27;re fighting for. This is an excellent opportunity to seize control of the Republican Party.&quot; Even so, the two treaties were signed September 7, 1977, ratified by the Panamanian election of October 23, 1977, and approved (68-32) by the U. S. Senate on March 16, 1978 and April 18, 1978.

In 1980, the ACU estimated that it would cost roughly $1.8 million to defeat SALT II; together with other conservative groups, SALT opponents outspent supporters 15:1. Having found the technique of mass mailing to be successful during other campaigns, the ACU used this same technique to oppose SALT II, reaching roughly 500,000 people with this strategy. Additionally, they produced a half-hour-long anti-SALT television program called &quot;Soviet Might/American Myth: The United States in Retreat&quot;, which was aired on 200 television stations around the country.

In 1985, the ACU sent out roughly 100,000 pieces of mail in support of Nicaraguan contra aid in 1985. They also escorted Nicaraguan refugees around Capitol Hill in order to persuade undecided politicians to support Reagan&#x27;s contra aid request.

== Leadership ==
Founding members include: William F. Buckley, Jr. Rep. Donald Bruce (R.-Ind.), Rep. John Ashbrook (R.-Ohio), Rep. Katherine St. George (R.-N.Y.), William A. Rusher, Frank Meyer, Thomas S. Winter, John A. Howard and L. Brent Bozell. Donald Bruce served as the first chairman from 1964 to 1966, succeeded by John Ashbrook from 1966 to 1971. 

M. Stanton Evans then served six years from 1971 to 1977, succeeded by a two-year term served by Philip Crane from 1977 to 1979. Mickey Edwards served as chairman from 1979 to 1983. 

David Keene was chairman from 1984 until 2011, succeeded by Al Cardenas, who served until 2014. 

Cardenas was succeeded by the ninth and current chairman, Matt Schlapp, who has previously served as George W. Bush&#x27;s political director.

== Lobbying in the 21st century ==
According to OpenSecrets, the American Conservative Union spent roughly $20,000 on lobbying in 2001, $400,000 in 2003, and $1,100,000 in 2005. They did not spend any money on lobbying in 2004. In the years since Schlapp was elected chairman of ACU, the organization has spent $120,000 on lobbying.

Recurring lobbyists are Lorenz Hart and Amir Iljazi.

== Controversies ==

=== FedEx ===
In 2009, the ACU offered FedEx requested and solicited payment of fees totaling $3.4 million for e-mail and other services for &quot;an aggressive grass-roots campaign&quot; to stop a legislative provision being considered by the U.S. Senate. The letter said the ACU&#x27;s campaign could include &quot;Producing op-eds and articles written by ACU’s Chairman David Keene and/or other members of the ACU’s Board of Directors.&quot;

Two weeks later, Keene and leaders of five other conservative organizations issued a letter saying that FedEx was mischaracterizing the legislative situation and was unfairly trying to tap into public resentment against federal bailouts to attack its competition. The letter included, at its top, logos from the ACU and the other organizations. Whitfield said that Keene had endorsed the second letter as an individual, even though the letter bore the logo of the ACU. The ACU then issued a press release saying that permission to use the logo had not been given by the ACU, and that the ACU continued to stand with the policy supported by FedEx.

=== Embezzlement ===
Diana Hubbard Carr, the ACU&#x27;s former administrative director and ex-wife of David Keene, pleaded guilty in June 2011 to embezzling between $120,000 and $400,000 from 2006 to 2009, during her time as bookkeeper for the group.

<text>is a Japanese amateur astronomer who discovered a number of comets.

As a young adult, Ikeya lived near Lake Hamana and worked for a piano factory. During his employment there, he made his first discovery in 1963 with an optical telescope he built himself within his low budget. Two years later, he discovered the bright comet C/1965 S1 (Ikeya-Seki). Ikeya discovered the periodic comet 153P/Ikeya-Zhang on February 1, 2002, in Mori, Hokkaidō. The asteroid 4037 Ikeya is also named after Ikeya. On November 13, 2010, Ikeya and Shigeki Murakami co-discovered the comet P/2010 V1, now known as 332P/Ikeya-Murakami, using an optical telescope, rare in an era with access to digital imaging technology.

Ikeya contributed his skill to the perfectly ground optics used in the construction of the Pentax 40 cm Cassegrain reflector telescope installed at the Singapore Science Centre Observatory in March, 1989.

<doc id="631462" wikidata="Q4993635" url="?curid=631462" title="Is It Easy to Be Young?">
<text>Is It Easy to Be Young? (, ) is a Soviet-era Latvian documentary film directed by Juris Podnieks. It was filmed in 1986 with dialogue in both Latvian and Russian, and is considered to be among the most controversial movies of its era. It was one of the five winners of the 1987 International Documentary Association awards.

The movie speaks about young people who perished as a result of growing up in Soviet society—their conflicts with parents and society, the patronizing attitudes of their teachers and the authorities, the fear that there is no meaning to their lives. Among the young people portrayed are high-schoolers looking for their place in life, a young mother worried about the future of her daughter after the Chernobyl catastrophe, a young man follower of the Hare Krishna movement (an &#x27;unusual&#x27; religion that was discouraged even more than &#x27;usual&#x27; ones by the Soviet government), as well young adults returning from compulsory military service in the Soviet–Afghan War and having become ones of &#x27;the lost generation&#x27;. The film&#x27;s opening scene documents a concert by the banned Latvian rock band, Pērkons.

The movie had a major impact in the Soviet Union. It was seen by at least 28 million people during its first year. In all, 85 countries bought the rights to show the movie.

In 1986 the film received Latvian Film Prize for the best documentary. Its international debut was at the 1987 Kraków Film Festival, where it received the FIPRESCI Award. It was also screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.

The film was re-released in 2007 by Jura Podnieka Studija; the new edition includes oral history interviews with Podnieks&#x27;s colleagues.

After Latvia regained independence, Antra Cilinska filmed two sequels (&quot;Is It Easy to Be?&quot; in 1998, and &quot;Is it Easy?&quot; in 2010), featuring interviews with people filmed by Podnieks.

<text>The Northampton Balloon Festival is an annual hot air balloon festival held in Northampton, England.

The original festival was held in The Racecourse and managed by the (now defunct) Borough Council, and took place over a Friday, Saturday and Sunday in mid-August. The main features of the festival were the twice-daily hot air balloon lifts and a balloon glow, but other attractions included trade stalls, live music and arena entertainment.

==History==
The first festival was held in 1990. The start attractions were the Chubb fire extinguisher and the Rupert The Bear balloons.
In its early years The Northampton balloon was a soaring success with families encouraged to come and enjoy the weekend, looking at balloons and visiting various trade stalls across the park.

In 2001 the festival was joined with the Northampton Town Show (previously held during July) to become the &quot;Northampton Festival&quot;, but has since reverted to its original name.

The 2004 festival featured the &quot;Sugababes&quot;, &quot;Big Brovaz&quot;, and Ronan Keating.

The 2005 festival featured Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Rachel Stevens and Lemar.

The 2007 festival was a disaster due to poor attendance caused by bad weather on the last two days and the fact that the council decided to charge adults for admission, which discouraged many adults without young children from attending and spending money at the stalls.

The 2008 festival was scaled down from before, with fewer stalls,
and featured Rick Astley and Signature but neither were able to revive the festival&#x27;s fortunes and the event made a huge loss.

The Borough Council ceased its funding and in mid-2009 the festival was revived by new organisers and moved to Billing Aquadrome. It took place 14–16 August 2009 at the new location with free admission.

The 2010 Northampton Balloon Festival was once again based at Billing Aquadrome, however that year the organisers chose to charge entry. The Balloon Festival sat alongside an existing event, the American Car Show and included a variety of stalls and fairground rides.

In 2012, it was announced that Pure Leisure, the owners of Billing Aquadrome had agreed sponsorship of the event, for a further 3 years.

The Northampton Balloon Festival was held again on Friday 16th to Sunday 18 August 2013, 15-17 August 2014, 14–16 August 2015, 19–21 August 2016, 18-20 August 2017 and between 17 and 19 August 2018.

2019 saw the last ever Northampton Balloon Festival take place, as Billing Aquadrome subsequently pulled out of hosting the event. This was due to the limited number of flights over the previous two years&#x27; festivals, caused by adverse weather which restricted flying on those occasions.

In 2023 the Northampton Balloon Festival was held in &quot;The Racecourse&quot; park.

<doc id="631490" wikidata="Q5133243" url="?curid=631490" title="Clifton Hill House">
<text>Clifton Hill House is a Grade I listed Palladian villa in the Clifton area of Bristol, England. It was the first hall of residence for women in south-west England in 1909 due to the efforts of May Staveley. It is still used as a hall of residence by the University of Bristol.

==History==
The house was built between 1746 and 1750 for the wealthy merchant and philanthropist Paul Fisher, by Isaac Ware, a nationally renowned architect and translator of Palladio&#x27;s works. Thomas Paty, later a notable Bristol architect, worked as a mason during its construction. The house stands on a steep slope, so that while only three stories face the street, the five-bay garden front is four stories tall with low wings (both raised from one story to two during the nineteenth century) and a double flight of steps down to the garden. There is a World War II Air raid shelter accessible beneath the steps which is visible from the South Façade. Before 1850, the far end of the garden was sold and built into the Bellevue terrace.

Original rococo plasterwork, by Joseph Thomas, survives in a number of interior rooms. The Symonds Music Room, which adjoins the Drawing Room, was constructed in the 1850s and extends beyond the left point of the south faćade. The vantage point of the house offered a view of the Avon, of the city of Bristol, and of the Bath hills.

The house was later home to the nineteenth century &#x27;man-of-letters&#x27;, John Addington Symonds, whose father had bought the house in 1851.

In 1907 May Staveley a lecturer in the History Department of the University of Bristol, started lobbying for need to provide a hall for her students. With support from the Fry family, the Symonds family and private subscriptions, the house was bought for £5000 in 1909. Following some alterations and furnishing, the hall accepted its first residents on 30 September. Clifton Hill House was the first hall of residence for women in south-west England.

In 1911, the university took over the running of the house and they bought the adjacent Callandar House, which dates from the late 18th century and is itself Grade II listed. Callandar House was extended in the 1920s thanks to the Wills family (regular benefactors to the university) and, along with Old Clifton, continued to house only female residents. Additional land was acquired and in the early 1960s Fry Wing was constructed on 5 floors (&quot;A&quot; to &quot;E&quot; floors) with South Wing following some 10 years later with its 4 floors (&quot;D&quot; to &quot;G&quot; floors). Clifton Hill House now houses approximately 230 students in total, of all genders. There is a Junior Common Room with a stage and bar.

The Hall has been used by the BBC as a film location for &quot;The House of Eliott&quot; and for episodes of &quot;Casualty&quot;.

<doc id="631494" wikidata="Q201605" url="?curid=631494" title="Moment magnitude scale">
<text>The moment magnitude scale (MMS; denoted explicitly with &#x27; or Mwg, and generally implied with use of a single M for magnitude) is a measure of an earthquake&#x27;s magnitude (&quot;size&quot; or strength) based on its seismic moment. &#x27; was defined in a 1979 paper by Thomas C. Hanks and Hiroo Kanamori. Similar to the local magnitude/Richter scale () defined by Charles Francis Richter in 1935, it uses a logarithmic scale; small earthquakes have approximately the same magnitudes on both scales. Despite the difference, news media often use the term &quot;Richter scale&quot; when referring to the moment magnitude scale.

Moment magnitude () is considered the authoritative magnitude scale for ranking earthquakes by size. It is more directly related to the energy of an earthquake than other scales, and does not saturatethat is, it does not underestimate magnitudes as other scales do in certain conditions. It has become the standard scale used by seismological authorities like the United States Geological Survey for reporting large earthquakes (typically M &gt; 4), replacing the local magnitude () and surface-wave magnitude () scales. Subtypes of the moment magnitude scale (, etc.) reflect different ways of estimating the seismic moment.

== History ==

=== Richter scale: the original measure of earthquake magnitude ===
At the beginning of the twentieth century, very little was known about how earthquakes happen, how seismic waves are generated and propagate through the Earth&#x27;s crust, and what information they carry about the earthquake rupture process; the first magnitude scales were therefore empirical. The initial step in determining earthquake magnitudes empirically came in 1931 when the Japanese seismologist Kiyoo Wadati showed that the maximum amplitude of an earthquake&#x27;s seismic waves diminished with distance at a certain rate. Charles F. Richter then worked out how to adjust for epicentral distance (and some other factors) so that the logarithm of the amplitude of the seismograph trace could be used as a measure of &quot;magnitude&quot; that was internally consistent and corresponded roughly with estimates of an earthquake&#x27;s energy. He established a reference point and the ten-fold (exponential) scaling of each degree of magnitude, and in 1935 published what he called the &quot;magnitude scale&quot;, now called the local magnitude scale, labeled . (This scale is also known as the &quot;Richter scale&quot;, but news media sometimes use that term indiscriminately to refer to other similar scales.)

The local magnitude scale was developed on the basis of shallow (~ deep), moderate-sized earthquakes at a distance of approximately , conditions where the surface waves are predominant. At greater depths, distances, or magnitudes the surface waves are greatly reduced, and the local magnitude scale underestimates the magnitude, a problem called &quot;saturation&quot;. Additional scales were developed – a surface-wave magnitude scale () by Beno Gutenberg in 1945, a body-wave magnitude scale () by Gutenberg and Richter in 1956, and a number of variants – to overcome the deficiencies of the scale, but all are subject to saturation. A particular problem was that the scale (which in the 1970s was the preferred magnitude scale) saturates around and therefore underestimates the energy release of &quot;great&quot; earthquakes such as the 1960 Chilean and 1964 Alaskan earthquakes. These had magnitudes of 8.5 and 8.4 respectively but were notably more powerful than other M 8 earthquakes; their moment magnitudes were closer to 9.6 and 9.3, respectively.

=== Single couple or double couple ===
The study of earthquakes is challenging as the source events cannot be observed directly, and it took many years to develop the mathematics for understanding what the seismic waves from an earthquake can tell about the source event. An early step was to determine how different systems of forces might generate seismic waves equivalent to those observed from earthquakes.

The simplest force system is a single force acting on an object. If it has sufficient strength to overcome any resistance it will cause the object to move (&quot;translate&quot;). A pair of forces, acting on the same &quot;line of action&quot; but in opposite directions, will cancel; if they cancel (balance) exactly there will be no net translation, though the object will experience stress, either tension or compression. If the pair of forces are offset, acting along parallel but separate lines of action, the object experiences a rotational force, or torque. In mechanics (the branch of physics concerned with the interactions of forces) this model is called a &quot;couple&quot;, also &quot;simple couple&quot; or &quot;single couple&quot;. If a second couple of equal and opposite magnitude is applied their torques cancel; this is called a &quot;double couple&quot;. A double couple can be viewed as &quot;equivalent to a pressure and tension acting simultaneously at right angles&quot;.

In 1923 Hiroshi Nakano showed that certain aspects of seismic waves could be explained in terms of a double couple model. This led to a three-decade-long controversy over the best way to model the seismic source: as a single couple, or a double couple. While Japanese seismologists favored the double couple, most seismologists favored the single couple. Although the single couple model had some shortcomings, it seemed more intuitive, and there was a belief – mistaken, as it turned out – that the elastic rebound theory for explaining why earthquakes happen required a single couple model. In principle these models could be distinguished by differences in the radiation patterns of their S waves, but the quality of the observational data was inadequate for that.

 but not from a single couple. This was confirmed as better and more plentiful data coming from the World-Wide Standard Seismograph Network (WWSSN) permitted closer analysis of seismic waves. Notably, in 1966 Keiiti Aki showed that the seismic moment of the 1964 Niigata earthquake as calculated from the seismic waves on the basis of a double couple was in reasonable agreement with the seismic moment calculated from the observed physical dislocation.

=== Dislocation theory ===
A double couple model suffices to explain an earthquake&#x27;s far-field pattern of seismic radiation, but tells us very little about the nature of an earthquake&#x27;s source mechanism or its physical features. While slippage along a fault was theorized as the cause of earthquakes (other theories included movement of magma, or sudden changes of volume due to phase changes), observing this at depth was not possible, and understanding what could be learned about the source mechanism from the seismic waves requires an understanding of the source mechanism.

Modeling the physical process by which an earthquake generates seismic waves required much theoretical development of dislocation theory, first formulated by the Italian Vito Volterra in 1907, with further developments by E. H. Love in 1927. More generally applied to problems of stress in materials, an extension by F. Nabarro in 1951 was recognized by the Russian geophysicist A. V. Vvedenskaya as applicable to earthquake faulting. In a series of papers starting in 1956 she and other colleagues used dislocation theory to determine part of an earthquake&#x27;s focal mechanism, and to show that a dislocation – a rupture accompanied by slipping – was indeed equivalent to a double couple.

In a pair of papers in 1958, J. A. Steketee worked out how to relate dislocation theory to geophysical features. Numerous other researchers worked out other details, culminating in a general solution in 1964 by Burridge and Knopoff, which established the relationship between double couples and the theory of elastic rebound, and provided the basis for relating an earthquake&#x27;s physical features to seismic moment.

=== Seismic moment ===
&quot;Seismic moment&quot; – symbol – is a measure of the fault slip and area involved in the earthquake. Its value is the torque of each of the two force couples that form the earthquake&#x27;s equivalent double-couple. (More precisely, it is the scalar magnitude of the second-order moment tensor that describes the force components of the double-couple.) Seismic moment is measured in units of Newton meters (N·m) or Joules, or (in the older CGS system) dyne-centimeters (dyn-cm).

The first calculation of an earthquake&#x27;s seismic moment from its seismic waves was by Keiiti Aki for the 1964 Niigata earthquake. He did this two ways. First, he used data from distant stations of the WWSSN to analyze long-period (200 second) seismic waves (wavelength of about 1,000 kilometers) to determine the magnitude of the earthquake&#x27;s equivalent double couple. Second, he drew upon the work of Burridge and Knopoff on dislocation to determine the amount of slip, the energy released, and the stress drop (essentially how much of the potential energy was released). In particular, he derived an equation that relates an earthquake&#x27;s seismic moment to its physical parameters:

with being the rigidity (or resistance to moving) of a fault with a surface area of over an average dislocation (distance) of . (Modern formulations replace with the equivalent , known as the &quot;geometric moment&quot; or &quot;potency&quot;.) By this equation the &quot;moment&quot; determined from the double couple of the seismic waves can be related to the moment calculated from knowledge of the surface area of fault slippage and the amount of slip. In the case of the Niigata earthquake the dislocation estimated from the seismic moment reasonably approximated the observed dislocation.

Seismic moment is a measure of the work (more precisely, the torque) that results in inelastic (permanent) displacement or distortion of the Earth&#x27;s crust. It is related to the total energy released by an earthquake. However, the power or potential destructiveness of an earthquake depends (among other factors) on how much of the total energy is converted into seismic waves. This is typically 10% or less of the total energy, the rest being expended in fracturing rock or overcoming friction (generating heat).

Nonetheless, seismic moment is regarded as the fundamental measure of earthquake size, representing more directly than other parameters the physical size of an earthquake. As early as 1975 it was considered &quot;one of the most reliably determined instrumental earthquake source parameters&quot;.

=== Introduction of an energy-motivated magnitude &quot;M&quot;w ===

Most earthquake magnitude scales suffered from the fact that they only provided a comparison of the amplitude of waves produced at a standard distance and frequency band; it was difficult to relate these magnitudes to a physical property of the earthquake. Gutenberg and Richter suggested that radiated energy Es could be estimated as

:formula_1,

(in Joules). Unfortunately, the duration of many very large earthquakes was longer than 20 seconds, the period of the surface waves used in the measurement of . This meant that giant earthquakes such as the 1960 Chilean earthquake (M 9.5) were only assigned an . Caltech seismologist Hiroo Kanamori recognized this deficiency and took the simple but important step of defining a magnitude based on estimates of radiated energy, , where the &quot;w&quot; stood for work (energy):
:formula_2

Kanamori recognized that measurement of radiated energy is technically difficult since it involves the integration of wave energy over the entire frequency band. To simplify this calculation, he noted that the lowest frequency parts of the spectrum can often be used to estimate the rest of the spectrum. The lowest frequency asymptote of a seismic spectrum is characterized by the seismic moment, . Using an approximate relation between radiated energy and seismic moment (which assumes stress drop is complete and ignores fracture energy),

:formula_3

(where E is in Joules and is in Nformula_4m), Kanamori approximated by

:formula_5

=== Moment magnitude scale ===

The formula above made it much easier to estimate the energy-based magnitude , but it changed the fundamental nature of the scale into a moment magnitude scale. USGS seismologist Thomas C. Hanks noted that Kanamori&#x27;s scale was very similar to a relationship between and that was reported by 

:formula_6

 combined their work to define a new magnitude scale based on estimates of seismic moment

:formula_7

where formula_8 is defined in newton meters (N·m).

== Current use ==

Moment magnitude is now the most common measure of earthquake size for medium to large earthquake magnitudes, but in practice, seismic moment (), the seismological parameter it is based on, is not measured routinely for smaller quakes. For example, the United States Geological Survey does not use this scale for earthquakes with a magnitude of less than 3.5, which includes the great majority of quakes.

Popular press reports most often deal with significant earthquakes larger than . For these events, the preferred magnitude is the moment magnitude , not Richter&#x27;s local magnitude .

== Definition ==
The symbol for the moment magnitude scale is , with the subscript &quot;w&quot; meaning mechanical work accomplished. The moment magnitude is a dimensionless value defined by Hiroo Kanamori as

:formula_9

where is the seismic moment in dyne⋅cm (10−7 N⋅m). The constant values in the equation are chosen to achieve consistency with the magnitude values produced by earlier scales, such as the local magnitude and the surface wave magnitude. Thus, a magnitude zero microearthquake has a seismic moment of approximately , while the Great Chilean earthquake of 1960, with an estimated moment magnitude of 9.4–9.6, had a seismic moment between and . 

Seismic moment magnitude (&quot;M&quot; wg or Das Magnitude Scale ) and moment magnitude (&quot;M&quot; w) scales

To understand the magnitude scales based on &quot;M&quot;o detailed background of &quot;M&quot;wg and &quot;M&quot;w scales is given below.

&quot;M&quot;w scale

Hiroo Kanamori defined a magnitude scale (Log &quot;W&quot;0 = 1.5 &quot;M&quot;w + 11.8, where &quot;W&quot;0 is the minimum strain energy) for great earthquakes using Gutenberg Richter Eq. (1).

Log Es = 1.5 Ms + 11.8                                                                                     (A)

Hiroo Kanamori used &quot;W&quot;0 in place of &quot;E&quot;s (dyn.cm) and consider a constant term (&quot;W&quot;0/&quot;M&quot;o = 5 × 10−5) in Eq. (A) and estimated &quot;M&quot;s and denoted as &quot;M&quot;w (dyn.cm). The energy Eq. (A) is derived by substituting &quot;m&quot; = 2.5 + 0.63 M in the energy equation Log &quot;E&quot; = 5.8 + 2.4 m (Richter 1958), where &quot;m&quot; is the Gutenberg unified magnitude and &quot;M&quot; is a least squares approximation to the magnitude determined from surface wave magnitudes. After replacing the ratio of seismic Energy (&quot;E&quot;) and Seismic Moment (&quot;M&quot;o), i.e., &quot;E&quot;/&quot;M&quot;o = 5 × 10−5, into the Gutenberg–Richter energy magnitude Eq. (A), Hanks and Kanamori provided Eq. (B):

Log M0 = 1.5 Ms + 16.1                                                                                   (B)

Note that Eq. (B) was already derived by Hiroo Kanamori and termed it as &quot;M&quot;w. Eq. (B) was based on large earthquakes; hence, in order to validate Eq. (B) for intermediate and smaller earthquakes, Hanks and Kanamori (1979) compared this Eq. (B) with Eq. (1) of Percaru and Berckhemer (1978) for the magnitude 5.0 ≤ &quot;M&quot;s ≤ 7.5 (Hanks and Kanamori 1979). Note that Eq. (1) of Percaru and Berckhemer (1978) for the magnitude range 5.0 ≤ &quot;M&quot;s ≤ 7.5 is not reliable due to the inconsistency of defined magnitude range (moderate to large earthquakes defined as &quot;M&quot;s ≤ 7.0 and &quot;M&quot;s = 7–7.5) and scarce data in lower magnitude range (≤ 7.0) which rarely represents the global seismicity (e.g., see Figs. 1A, B, 4 and Table 2 of Percaru and Berckhemer 1978). Furthermore, Equation (1) of Percaru and Berckhemer 1978) is only valid for (≤ 7.0).

== Relations between seismic moment, potential energy released and radiated energy ==
Seismic moment is not a direct measure of energy changes during an earthquake. The relations between seismic moment and the energies involved in an earthquake depend on parameters that have large uncertainties and that may vary between earthquakes. Potential energy is stored in the crust in the form of elastic energy due to built-up stress and gravitational energy. During an earthquake, a portion formula_10 of this stored energy is transformed into
* energy dissipated formula_11 in frictional weakening and inelastic deformation in rocks by processes such as the creation of cracks
* heat formula_12
* radiated seismic energy formula_13

The potential energy drop caused by an earthquake is related approximately to its seismic moment by

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the average of the &quot;absolute&quot; shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., equation 3 of ) and formula_16 is the average of the shear moduli of the rocks that constitute the fault. Currently, there is no technology to measure absolute stresses at all depths of interest, nor method to estimate it accurately, and formula_15 is thus poorly known. It could vary highly from one earthquake to another. Two earthquakes with identical formula_18 but different formula_15 would have released different formula_10.

The radiated energy caused by an earthquake is approximately related to seismic moment by

:formula_21

where formula_22 is radiated efficiency and formula_23 is the static stress drop, i.e., the difference between shear stresses on the fault before and after the earthquake (e.g., from equation 1 of ). These two quantities are far from being constants. For instance, formula_24 depends on rupture speed; it is close to 1 for regular earthquakes but much smaller for slower earthquakes such as tsunami earthquakes and slow earthquakes. Two earthquakes with identical formula_18 but different formula_24 or formula_23 would have radiated different formula_28.

Because formula_28 and formula_18 are fundamentally independent properties of an earthquake source, and since formula_28 can now be computed more directly and robustly than in the 1970s, introducing a separate magnitude associated to radiated energy was warranted. Choy and Boatwright defined in 1995 the &quot;energy magnitude&quot;

: formula_32

where formula_28 is in J (N·m).

== Comparative energy released by two earthquakes ==

Assuming the values of are the same for all earthquakes, one can consider as a measure of the potential energy change Δ&quot;W&quot; caused by earthquakes. Similarly, if one assumes formula_34 is the same for all earthquakes, one can consider as a measure of the energy &quot;E&quot;s radiated by earthquakes.

Under these assumptions, the following formula, obtained by solving for the equation defining , allows one to assess the ratio formula_35 of energy release (potential or radiated) between two earthquakes of different moment magnitudes, formula_36 and formula_37:
:formula_38.

As with the Richter scale, an increase of one step on the logarithmic scale of moment magnitude corresponds to a 101.5 ≈ 32 times increase in the amount of energy released, and an increase of two steps corresponds to a 103 = 1,000 times increase in energy. Thus, an earthquake of of 7.0 contains 1,000 times as much energy as one of 5.0 and about 32 times that of 6.0.

=== Comparison with TNT equivalents ===

To make the significance of the magnitude value plausible, the seismic energy released during the earthquake is sometimes compared to the effect of the conventional chemical explosive TNT.
The seismic energy formula_39 results from the above-mentioned formula according to Gutenberg and Richter to

: formula_40

or converted into Hiroshima bombs:

:formula_41

For comparison of seismic energy (in joules) with the corresponding explosion energy, a value of 4.2 x 109 joules per ton of TNT applies. The table illustrates the relationship between seismic energy and moment magnitude.

The end of the scale is at the value 10.6, corresponding to the assumption that at this value the Earth&#x27;s crust would have to break apart completely.

== Subtypes of Mw ==
Various ways of determining moment magnitude have been developed, and several subtypes of the scale can be used to indicate the basis used.

* – Based on &quot;moment tensor inversion&quot; of long-period (~10 – 100 s) body-waves.
* – From a &quot;moment tensor inversion&quot; of complete waveforms at regional distances (~1,000 miles). Sometimes called RMT.
* – Derived from a &quot;centroid moment tensor inversion&quot; of intermediate- and long-period body- and surface-waves.
* – Derived from a &quot;centroid moment tensor inversion&quot; of the W-phase.
* () – Developed by Seiji Tsuboi for quick estimation of the tsunami potential of large near-coastal earthquakes from measurements of the P waves, and later extended to teleseismic earthquakes in general.
* – A duration-amplitude procedure which takes into account the duration of the rupture, providing a fuller picture of the energy released by longer lasting (&quot;slow&quot;) ruptures than seen with .
* –Rapidly estimates earthquake magnitude by combining maximum displacements of teleseismic P wave and source durations.

<text>Muzio Attendolo Sforza (28 May 1369 – 4 January 1424) was an Italian condottiero. Founder of the Sforza dynasty, he led a Bolognese-Florentine army at the Battle of Casalecchio.

He was the father of Francesco Sforza, who ruled Milan for 16 years.

==Biography==
Giacomuzzo was born in 1369 in Cotignola (Romagna) to a rich family of rural nobility, son of Giovanni Attendolo (died 1385/1386) and Elisa. Muzio was the short form of the nickname of Giacomuzzo, which was the name of his paternal grandfather.

According to tradition, young Giacomo was ploughing a field when mercenaries led by Boldrino da Panicale passed nearby in search of recruits. He then stole one of his father&#x27;s horses and followed the soldiers to follow the same career.

Later, together with his brothers Bosio, Francesco and Bartolo and two cousins, Muzio joined the company of Alberico da Barbiano, who nicknamed him &quot;Sforza&quot; (&#x27;Strong&#x27;). In 1398 he was at the service of Perugia against the Milanese troops of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, to whom Muzio soon switched his loyalty following the typical behaviour of mercenary chieftains of the time. Later Muzio fought for Florence against Visconti but in 1402, at the Battle of Casalecchio, was defeated by his former master Alberico da Barbiano. By 1409, he was in the employ of Niccolò III d&#x27;Este of Ferrara, who was being menaced by Ottobono Terzi of Parma.

King Ladislaus of Naples named him Gran Connestabile of his kingdom. Sforza&#x27;s military qualities were mostly needed against Florence and the pope. He remained for the rest of his life in the Kingdom of Naples, after the king&#x27;s death (1414), at the service of Queen Joanna II. However, he attracted the jealousy of Joan&#x27;s favourite, Pandolfello Alopo, who had him arrested and imprisoned. However, when Sforza&#x27;s troops intervened, Alopo freed him and Joan gave him the fiefdoms of Benevento and Manfredonia. On this occasion, Sforza married Caterina Alopo, Pandolfello&#x27;s sister. A few months later Sforza was again arrested after a quarrel with James of Bourbon. He was freed only in 1416, after James&#x27; fall from power, and Joan gave him back the title of &quot;Conestabile&quot;.

In 1417 Sforza was sent by Joan to help the pope against Braccio da Montone, together with his son Francesco. Later he returned briefly to Naples, but here he was opposed by Giovanni (Sergianni) Caracciolo, Joan&#x27;s new lover. In the following, confused, events that led to the arrival of Louis III of Anjou in Naples in opposition to Alfonso V of Aragon, Sforza helped Joan and Sergianni to flee to Aversa.

In 1423, the city of L&#x27;Aquila rebelled against Braccio da Montone and he was sent to support it. In an attempt to save one of his pages during the fording of the River Pescara, Sforza drowned and his body was swept away by the waters.

==Family==
Sforza had sixteen known children born from five marriages:

In 1409, Sforza married firstly with Antonia (died 1411), widow of Francesco Casali, Lord of Cortona and daughter of Francesco Salimbeni, Patrician of Siena and Lord of Chiusi, Radicofani, Bagno Vignoni, Carsoli and Sarteano. They had:
*Bosio (1410–1476), Count of Cotignola (1424), Lord of Castell&#x27;Arquato and Sovereign Count of Santa Fiora by virtue of his marriage (1439) with Cecilia Aldobrandeschi, Countess of Santa Fiora and Pitigliano.

On 16 June 1413, Sforza married secondly with Caterina (also named &quot;Catella&quot;; died 1418 in childbirth), a sister of Pandolfello Piscopo &quot;Alopo&quot;, Grand Chamberlain of the Kingdom of Naples and lover of Queen Joanna II. They had:
*Leonardo (1415–1438).
*Pietro (1417–1442), Bishop of Ascoli Piceno since 1438.
*Giovanna (born and died 1418).

In 1421, Sforza married thirdly with Maria (died 1440), daughter of Giacomo da Marzano, 1st Duke of Sessa, and Sovereign Countess of Celano after inheriting from her first husband Nicola de Berardi. They had:
*Bartolomeo (1420–1435), Count of Celano (1430).
*Carlo (15 June 1423 – 12 September 1457), later renamed &quot;Gabriele&quot; in his ordination, Archbishop of Milan since 1445.

With Tamira di Cagli, Sforza had two children:
*Mansueto (), Abbot of San Lorenzo of Cremona (1425).
*Onestina (1402–1422), a Benedictine nun.

With Lucia Terzani de Martini (or &quot;Lucia Demartini&quot; according to other sources; died 1461), They had:
*Francesco (23 July 1401 – 8 March 1466), Duke of Milan in 1450. 
*Elisa (1402–1476), married in 1417 to Leonello of Sanseverino, Count of Cajazzo.
*Alberico (1403–1423).
*Antonia (16 January 1404 – 1471), married firstly in 1417 to Ardizzone da Carrara, Lord of Feltre, and secondly in 1442 to Manfredo da Barbiano.

<text>Thomas Bradley Cotter (born September 29, 1970) is an American country music singer who won the 2004 season of &quot;Nashville Star&quot; a talent competition on the USA Network. Signed to Epic Records that year, he released his debut album &quot;Patient Man&quot;, which produced three singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country charts, including the No. 35 &quot;I Meant To&quot;. An independent EP, &quot;Continuity&quot;, followed in 2007.

==Biography==
Born in Opelika, Alabama, Cotter trained with Jerry Redd, who had performed with Elvis Presley and the gospel music group The Stamps Quartet. His first public performance was at the age of nine in a church in Columbus, Georgia. He recorded five gospel records in the next eight years, and was voted the &quot;top child Gospel soloist in America&quot;. He dropped out of performing in his late teen years, then returned to music in Auburn, where he joined the group Silverado.

Cotter left Silverado in 1993 and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he tried to get work as a solo act and a songwriter, landing cuts by Tommy Shane Steiner and Chad Brock, in addition to recording demos. He later competed on and won &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, then signed to a recording contract with Epic Records. Cotter&#x27;s debut album &quot;Patient Man&quot; was released in mid-2004 via Epic, with production by songwriter Steve Bogard. This album produced three chart singles on the country charts, including the Top 40 &quot;I Meant To&quot;, but Cotter exited the label before Epic closed its Nashville division in 2005. In 2007, Cotter signed with Adobe Road Records in Nashville, releasing an EP called &quot;Continuity&quot;.

In 2009, Cotter and Bogard reunited, and Cotter signed to OMG Records. His second full album, &quot;Right on Time&quot;, was released in June 2009.

<doc id="631508" wikidata="Q1134438" url="?curid=631508" title="Siphonophorae">
<text>Siphonophorae (from Ancient Greek φόρος (siphōn), meaning &quot;tube&quot; and -φόρος (-phóros), meaning &quot;bearing&quot;) is an order within Hydrozoa, a class of marine organisms within the phylum Cnidaria. According to the World Register of Marine Species, the order contains 175 species described thus far.

Siphonophores are highly polymorphic and complex organisms. Although they may appear to be individual organisms, each specimen is in fact a colonial organism composed of medusoid and polypoid zooids that are morphologically and functionally specialized. Zooids are multicellular units that develop from a single fertilized egg and combine to create functional colonies able to reproduce, digest, float, maintain body positioning, and use jet propulsion to move. Most colonies are long, thin, transparent floaters living in the pelagic zone.

Like other hydrozoans, some siphonophores emit light to attract and attack prey. While many sea animals produce blue and green bioluminescence, a siphonophore in the genus &quot;Erenna&quot; was only the second life form found to produce a red light (the first one being the scaleless dragonfish &quot;Chirostomias pliopterus&quot;).

==Anatomy and morphology==
===Colony characteristics===
Siphonophores are colonial hydrozoans that do not exhibit alternation of generations but instead reproduce asexually through a budding process. Zooids are the multicellular units that build the colonies. A single bud called the pro-bud initiates the growth of a colony by undergoing fission. Each zooid is produced to be genetically identical; however, mutations can alter their functions and increase diversity of the zooids within the colony. Siphonophores are unique in that the pro-bud initiates the production of diverse zooids with specific functions. The functions and organizations of the zooids in colonies widely vary among the different species; however, the majority of colonies are bilaterally arranged with dorsal and ventral sides to the stem. The stem is the vertical branch in the center of the colony to which the zooids attach. Zooids typically have special functions, and thus assume specific spatial patterns along the stem.

===General morphology===
Siphonophores typically exhibit one of three standard body plans matching the suborders: Cystonectae, Physonectae, and Calycophorae. Cystonects have a long stem with the attached zooids. Each group of zooids has a gastrozooid. The gastrozooid has a tentacle used for capturing and digesting food. The groups also have gonophores, which are specialized for reproduction. They use a pneumatophore, a gas-filled float, on their anterior end and drift at the surface of the water or stay afloat in the deep sea. Physonects have a pneumatophore and nectosome, which harbors the nectophores used for jet propulsion. The nectophores pump water backwards in order to move forward. Calycophorans differ from cystonects and physonects in that they have two nectophores and no pneumatophore. Instead they often possess oil-filled glands which likely help with buoyancy.

Siphonophores possess multiple types of zooid. Scientists have determined two possible evolutionary hypotheses for this observation: 1. As time has gone on, the amount of zooid types has increased. 2. The last common ancestor had many types of zooids and the diversity seen today is due to loss of zooid types. Research shows no evidence supporting the first hypothesis, and has seen some evidence in support of the second.

==== Zooids ====
:Siphonophores can have zooids that are either polyps or medusae. However, zooids are unique and can develop to have different functions.

==== Nectophores ====
:Nectophores are medusae that assist in the propulsion and movement of some siphonophores in water. They are characteristic in physonectae and calycophores. The nectophores of these organisms are located in the nectosome where they can coordinate the swimming of colonies. The nectophores have also been observed in working in conjunction with reproductive structures in order to provide propulsion during colony detachment.

==== Bracts ====
:Bracts are zooids that are unique to the siphonophorae order. They function in protection and maintaining a neutral buoyancy. However, bracts are not present in all species of siphonophore.

==== Gastrozooids ====
:Gastrozooids are polyps that have evolved a function to assist in the feeding of siphonophores.

==== Palpons ====
:Palpons are modified gastrozooids that function in digestion by regulating the circulation of gastrovascular fluids.

==== Gonophores ====
:Gonophores are zooids that are involved in the reproductive processes of the siphonophores.

==== Pneumatophores ====
:The presence of pneumatophores characterizes the subgroups Cystonectae and Physonectae. They are gas-filled floats that are located at the anterior end of the colonies in these species. They function to help the colonies maintain their orientation in water. In the Cystonectae subgroup, the pneumatophores have an additional function of assisting with flotation of the organisms. The siphonophores exhibiting the feature develop the structure in early larval development via invaginations of the flattened planula structure. Further observations of the siphonophore species &quot;Nanomia bijuga&quot; indicate that the pneumatophore feature potentially also functions to sense pressure changes and regulate chemotaxis in some species.

==Distribution and habitat==
Currently, the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) identifies 175 species of siphonophores. They can differ greatly in terms of size and shape, which largely reflects the environment that they inhabit. Siphonophores are most often pelagic organisms, yet level species are benthic. Smaller, warm-water siphonophores typically live in the epipelagic zone and use their tentacles to capture zooplankton and copepods. Larger siphonophores live in deeper waters, as they are generally longer and more fragile and must avoid strong currents. They mostly feed on larger prey. The majority of siphonophores live in the deep sea and can be found in all of the oceans. Siphonophore species rarely only inhabit one location. Some species, however, can be confined to a specific range of depths and/or an area of the ocean.

==Behavior==
===Movement===
Siphonophores use a method of locomotion similar to jet propulsion. A siphonophore is a complex aggregate colony made up of many nectophores, which are clonal individuals that form by budding and are genetically identical. Depending on where each individual nectophore is positioned within the siphonophore, their function differs. Colonial movement is determined by individual nectophores of all developmental stages. The smaller individuals are concentrated towards the top of the siphonophore, and their function is turning and adjusting the orientation of the colony. Individuals will get larger the older they are. The larger individuals are located at the base of the colony, and their main function is thrust propulsion. These larger individuals are important in attaining the maximum speed of the colony. Every individual is key to the movement of the aggregate colony, and understanding their organization may allow us to make advances in our own multi-jet propulsion vehicles. The colonial organization of siphonophores, particularly in &quot;Nanomia bijuga&quot; confers evolutionary advantages. A large number of concentrated individuals allows for redundancy. This means that even if some individual nectophores become functionally compromised, their role is bypassed so the colony as a whole is not negatively affected. The velum, a thin band of tissue surrounding the opening of the jet, also plays a role in swimming patterns, shown specifically through research done on the previous mentioned species &quot;N. bijuga.&quot; The velum becomes smaller and more circular during times of forward propulsion compared to a large velum that is seen during refill periods. Additionally, the position of the velum changes with swimming behaviors; the velum is curved downward in times of jetting, but during refill, the velum is moved back into the nectophore. The siphonophore &quot;Namonia bijuga&quot; also practices diel vertical migration, as it remains in the deep-sea during the day but rises during the night.

===Predation and feeding===
Siphonophores are predatory carnivores. Their diets consist of a variety of copepods, other small crustaceans, and small fish. Generally, the diets of strong swimming siphonophores consist of smaller prey, and the diets of weak swimming siphonophores consist of larger prey. A majority of siphonophores have gastrozooids that have a characteristic tentacle attached to the base of the zooid. This structural feature functions in assisting the organisms in catching prey. Species with large gastrozooids are capable of consuming a broad range of prey sizes. Similar to many other organisms in the phylum of Cnidaria, many siphonophore species exhibit nematocyst stinging capsules on branches of their tentacles called tentilla. The nematocysts are arranged in dense batteries on the side of the tentilla. When the siphonophore encounters potential prey, their tentillum react to where the tentacles create a net by transforming their shape around the prey. The nematocysts then shoot millions of paralyzing, and sometimes fatal, toxin molecules at the trapped prey which is then transferred to the proper location for digestion. Some species of siphonophores use aggressive mimicry by using bioluminescent light so the prey cannot properly identify the predator.

There are four types of nematocysts in siphonophore tentilla: heteronemes, haplonemes, desmonemes, and rhopalonemes. Heteronemes are the largest nematocysts and are spines on a shaft close to tubules attached to the center of the siphonophore. Haplonemes have open-tipped tubules with spines, but no distinct shaft. This is the most common nematocyst among siphonophores. Desmonemes do not have spines but instead there are adhesive properties on the tubules to hold onto prey. Rhopalonemes are nematocysts with wide tubules for prey.

Due to the scarcity of food in the deep sea environment, a majority of siphonophore species function in a sit-and-wait tactic for food. The gelatinous body plan allows for flexibility when catching prey, but the gelatinous adaptations are based on habitat. They swim around waiting for their long tentacles to encounter prey. In addition, siphonophores in a group denoted &quot;Erenna&quot; have the ability to generate bioluminescence and red fluorescence while its tentilla twitches in a way to mimic motions of small crustaceans and copepods. These actions entice the prey to move closer to the siphonophore, allowing it to trap and digest it.

===Reproduction===
The modes of reproduction for siphonophores vary among the different species, and to this day, several modes remain unknown. Generally, a single zygote begins the formation of a colony of zooids. The fertilized egg matures into a protozooid, which initiates the budding process and creation of a new zooid. This process repeats until a colony of zooids forms around the central stalk. In contrast, several species reproduce using polyps. Polyps can hold eggs and/or sperm and can be released into the water from the posterior end of the siphonophore. The polyps may then be fertilized outside of the organism.

Siphonophores use gonophores to make the reproductive gametes. Gonophores are either male or female; however, the types of gonophores in a colony can vary among species. Species are characterized as monoecious or dioecious based on their gonophores. Monoecious species contain male and female gonophores in a single zooid colony, whereas dioecious species harbor male and female gonophores separately in different colonies of zooids.

===Bioluminescence===
Nearly all siphonophores have bioluminescent capabilities. Since these organisms are extremely fragile, they are rarely observed alive. Bioluminescence in siphonophores has been thought to have evolved as a defense mechanism. Siphonophores of the deep-sea genus &quot;Erenna&quot; (found at depths between ) are thought to use their bioluminescent capability for offense too, as a lure to attract fish. This genus is one of the few to prey on fish rather than crustaceans. The bioluminescent organs, called tentilla, on these non-visual individuals emit red fluorescence along with a rhythmic flicking pattern, which attracts prey as it resembles smaller organisms such as zooplankton and copepods. Thus, it has been concluded that they use luminescence as a lure to attract prey. Some research indicates that deep-sea organisms can not detect long wavelengths, and red light has a long wavelength of 680 nm. If this is the case, then fish are not lured by &quot;Erenna&quot;, and there must be another explanation. However, the deep-sea remains largely unexplored and red light sensitivity in fish such as &quot;Cyclothone&quot; and the deep myctophid fish should not be discarded.

Bioluminescent lures are found in many different species of siphonophores, and are used for a variety of reasons. Species such as &quot;Agalma okeni, Athorybia rosacea, Athorybia lucida,&quot; and &quot;Lychnafalma utricularia&quot; use their lures as a mimicry device to attract prey. &quot;A. rosacea&quot; mimic fish larvae, &quot;A. lucida&quot; are thought to mimic larvacean houses, and &quot;L. utricularia&quot; mimic hydromedusa. The species &quot;Resomia ornicephala&quot; uses their green and blue fluorescing tentilla to attract krill, helping them to outcompete other organisms that are hunting for the same prey. Siphonophores from the genus &quot;Erenna&quot; use bioluminescent lures surrounded by red fluorescence to attract prey and possibly mimic a fish from the &quot;Cyclothone&quot; genus. Their prey is lured in through a unique flicking behavior associated with the tentilla. When young, the tentilla of organisms in the &quot;Erenna&quot; genus contain only bioluminescent tissue, but, as the organism ages, red fluorescent material is also present in these tissues.

==Taxonomy==

Organisms in the order of Siphonophorae have been classified into the phylum Cnidaria and the class Hydrozoa. The phylogenetic relationships of siphonophores have been of great interest due to the high variability of the organization of their polyp colonies and medusae. Once believed to be a highly distinct group, larval similarities and morphological features have led researchers to believe that siphonophores had evolved from simpler colonial hydrozoans similar to those in the orders Anthoathecata and Leptothecata. Consequently, they are now united with these in the subclass Hydroidolina.

Early analysis divided siphonophores into three main subgroups based on the presence or the absence of two different traits: swimming bells (nectophores) and floats (pneumatophores). The subgroups consisted of Cystonectae, Physonectae, and Calycorphores. Cystonectae had pneumatophores, Calycophores had nectophores, and Physonectae had both.

Eukaryotic nuclear small subunit ribosomal gene 18S, eukaryotic mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal gene 16S, and transcriptome analyses further support the phylogenetic division of Siphonophorae into two main clades: Cystonectae and Codonophora. Suborders within Codonophora include Physonectae (consisting of the clades Calycophorae and Euphysonectae), Pyrostephidae, and Apolemiidae.

==History==
===Discovery===
Carl Linnaeus described the first siphonophore, the Portuguese man o&#x27; war, in 1758. The discovery rate of siphonophore species was slow in the 18th century, as only four additional species were found. During the 19th century, 56 new species were observed due to research voyages conducted by European powers. The majority of new species found during this time period were collected in coastal, surface waters. During the HMS &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition, various species of siphonophores were collected. Ernst Haeckel attempted to conduct a write up of all of the species of siphonophores collected on this expedition. He introduced 46 &quot;new species&quot;; however, his work was heavily critiqued because some of the species that he identified were eventually found not to be siphonophores. Nonetheless, some of his descriptions and figures (pictured below) are considered useful by modern biologists. A rate of about 10 new species discoveries per decade was observed during the 20th century. Considered the most important researcher of siphonophores, A. K. Totton introduced 23 new species of siphonophores during the mid-20th century.

On April 6, 2020, the Schmidt Ocean Institute announced the discovery of a giant &quot;Apolemia&quot; siphonophore in submarine canyons near Ningaloo Coast, measuring 15 m (49 ft) diameter with a ring approximately 47 m (154 ft) long, possibly the largest siphonophore, and longest animal, ever recorded.

There is no fossil record of siphonophores, though they have evolved and adapted for an extensive time period. Their phylum, Cnidaria, is an ancient lineage that dates back to c. 640 million years ago.

===Haeckel&#x27;s siphonophores===
Ernst Haeckel described numerous siphonophores, and several plates from his &quot;Kunstformen der Natur&quot; (1904) depict members of the taxon:

<doc id="631514" wikidata="Q2704401" url="?curid=631514" title="Physalia">
<text>Physalia is a genus of the order Siphonophorae, colonies of four specialized polyps and medusoids that drift on the surface of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans. Although these organisms look like a single multicellular organism, each specimen is actually a colony of minute organisms called zooids that have to work together for survival. A gas-filled bladder resembling a blue bottle provides buoyancy, and long tentacles of venomous cnidocytes provide a means of capturing prey. A sail on the float, which may be left or right-handed, propels &quot;Physalia&quot; about the sea, often in groups. These siphonophores sometimes become stranded on beaches, where their toxic nematocysts can remain potent for weeks or months in moist conditions. Both species of this siphonophore resemble a jellyfish in appearance, with their gas-filled float and cluster of polyps beneath, which can hang up to 30 or 165 ft (9 to 50 m) below the surface of the sea.

Because it frequently washes up on beaches on the coast of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans and is seen in the open ocean, &quot;Physalia&quot; is the best-known genus of siphonophore, as nearly all siphonophores live in the cold, dark ocean depths where they can only be observed in their natural habitat by a submersible or ROV.

The genus was first described by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1801.

==Diversity==
The family Physaliidae is monotypic, consisting of only one genus, &quot;Physalia&quot;. The genus is also monotypic, containing only &quot;P. physalis.&quot; There is a long history of the genus being described with multiple species, such as the Pacific man o&#x27; war (&quot;P. utriculus&quot;), however most of these species are now considered synonyms for &quot;P. physalis.&quot;

<doc id="631517" wikidata="Q1326854" url="?curid=631517" title="Cai Mao">
<text>Cai Mao () (190-208), courtesy name Degui, was a military officer serving under the warlords Liu Biao and Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China.

==Life==
Cai Mao came from the elite Cai family in Xiangyang, Nan Commandery (), the capital of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). His father was Cai Feng (). His aunt (Cai Feng&#x27;s sister) married Zhang Wen, who served as the Grand Commandant () during the reign of Emperor Ling. Cai Mao had two sisters – one married Huang Chengyan while the other married Liu Biao. Cai Mao also had two other notable relatives: Cai Zan (), courtesy name Maogui (), who served as the Chancellor of Mei (); and Cai Yan (), courtesy name Wengui (), who served as the Administrator of Ba Commandery (). The Cai family would later be robbed and massacred by bandits during the Yongjia era (307–313) of the Jin dynasty (266–420).

Cai Mao was known for being arrogant and proud. He served as a military officer under his brother-in-law Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province. In 190, when Liu Biao first started his tenure in Jing Province, Cai Mao, along with Kuai Liang and Kuai Yue, assisted him in quelling local rebellions and consolidating control over the province. Cai Mao subsequently served as the Administrator () of various commanderies in Jing Province, including Jiangxia (), Nan Commandery () and Zhangling (). In 192, after Liu Biao received the honorary appointment of General Who Guards the South () from the Han imperial court, he appointed Cai Mao as his military strategist.

Liu Biao had two sons – Liu Qi and Liu Cong – born to his first wife. The younger one, Liu Cong, married a niece of Cai Mao&#x27;s sister Lady Cai, so the Cai family favoured him and wanted him to succeed Liu Biao as the Governor of Jing Province in the future even though Liu Qi, being the elder son, should be the rightful successor. In 208, Cai Mao and Liu Biao&#x27;s maternal nephew Zhang Yun () plotted to harm Liu Qi. When Liu Qi heard about it, he found an excuse to leave Xiangyang and be the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery. After Liu Biao&#x27;s death later that year, Liu Cong became the new Governor of Jing Province with support from the Cai family.

In late 208, when the warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han central government and the figurehead Emperor Xian, led an army south to attack Jing Province, Cai Mao, Kuai Yue, Zhang Yun and others managed to persuade Liu Cong to surrender to Cao Cao. As Cai Mao had known Cao Cao since their younger days, Cao Cao treated him well and even visited his home. From then on, Cai Mao served under Cao Cao and subsequently held the following positions in Cao Cao&#x27;s administration: Assistant Officer of the Household (), Major () and Changshui Colonel (). He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Hanyang Village ().

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Cai Mao is cast as a minor villain of sorts alongside Liu Biao&#x27;s maternal nephew Zhang Yun (). Both of them are said to be highly skilled and experienced in naval warfare, having served as the commanders of Jing Province&#x27;s naval forces. In the novel, Cai Mao is also a maternal uncle of Liu Biao&#x27;s younger son Liu Cong because Liu Cong&#x27;s mother is Lady Cai (Cai Mao&#x27;s sister). In 208, after Liu Biao dies, Cai Mao, Lady Cai and Zhang Yun go against his final wish by supporting Liu Cong to be the new Governor of Jing Province. Later that year, Cai Mao urges Liu Cong to surrender to Cao Cao, who has led a massive army to invade Jing Province. Cao Cao accepts the surrender and allows Cai Mao and Zhang Yun to continue leading the naval forces.

In the opening stages of the Battle of Red Cliffs in the winter of 208–209, Cai Mao and Zhang Yun lead Cao Cao&#x27;s naval forces into battle against Sun Quan&#x27;s navy, which is led by Zhou Yu. After losing in the initial skirmishes, Cai Mao and Zhang Yun suggest to Cao Cao to link all his battleships with iron chains to improve stability and reduce the chances of the soldiers falling seasick from all the rocking while sailing on the river. When Zhou Yu hears about it, he uses a scheme to trick Jiang Gan into believing that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are planning to betray Cao Cao and defect to Sun Quan&#x27;s side. Jiang Gan returns to Cao Cao with a fake letter as evidence of Cai Mao and Zhang Yun&#x27;s &quot;treachery&quot;. Cao Cao falls for the ruse and orders Cai Mao and Zhang Yun to be executed. Although he realises his mistake later, it is too late.

<text>is a Japanese seismologist who has made fundamental contributions to understanding the physics of earthquakes and the tectonic processes that cause them.

== Career ==
Kanamori and American seismologist Thomas C. Hanks developed the moment magnitude scale which replaced the Richter scale as a measurement of the relative strength of earthquakes.

Kanamori invented the method for calculating slip distribution on the fault plane by teleseismic waveform with Masayuki Kikuchi. In addition, they studied realtime seismology.

In 2007 he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Basic Sciences.

Kanamori developed a new method of earthquake early warning detection by rapid analysis of the P wave by a robust network. The algorithm is currently being tested with the Southern California Seismic Network &quot;ShakeAlert&quot; Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system, and is one of three algorithms that is used by the system.

<doc id="631546" wikidata="Q1572476" url="?curid=631546" title="Nuestra Señora de Atocha">
<text>Nuestra Señora de Atocha () was a Spanish treasure galleon and the most widely known vessel of a fleet of ships that sank in a hurricane off the Florida Keys in 1622. At the time of her sinking, &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; was heavily laden with copper, silver, gold, tobacco, gems, and indigo from Spanish ports at Cartagena and Porto Bello in New Granada (present-day Colombia and Panama, respectively) and Havana, bound for Spain. The &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; was named for the Basilica of Nuestra Señora de Atocha in Madrid, Spain. It was a heavily armed Spanish galleon that served as the almirante (rear guard) for the Spanish fleet. It would trail behind the other ships in the flotilla to prevent an attack from the rear.

Much of the wreck of &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; was famously recovered by an American commercial treasure hunting expedition in 1985. Following a lengthy court battle against the State of Florida, the finders were ultimately awarded sole ownership of the rights to the treasure.

== Building and Dimensions ==
The &quot;Atocha&quot; was built for the Spanish Crown in Havana in 1620. She was rated at 550 tons, with an overall length of 112 feet, a beam of 34 feet, and a draft of 14 feet. She carried a square-rigged fore and mainmast and a lateen-rigged mizzenmast. Although there are no existing records, she likely had a high sterncastle, low waist, and high forecastle as was typical for an early 17th century Spanish galleon.

==Sinking==

&quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; had been delayed in Veracruz before she could rendezvous in Havana with the vessels of the Tierra Firme (Mainland) Fleet. The treasure, which arrived by mule in Panama City, was so immense that it took two months to record and load it onto the &quot;Atocha&quot;. After still more delays in Havana, what was ultimately a 28-ship convoy did not manage to depart for Spain until 4 September 1622, six weeks late. Each ship in the convoy carried crew, soldiers, passengers, provisions, and treasures from all over South America. The &quot;Atocha&quot; alone carried cargo whose estimates range between $250 and $500 million, including silver from Bolivia, Peru and Mexico, gold and emeralds from Colombia, and pearls from Venezuela, as well as more common goods including worked silverware, tobacco, and bronze cannons.

In the second day of its voyage from Havana, the convoy was overtaken by a hurricane in the Florida Straits. By the morning of 6 September, eight of the ships had sunk and their remains lay scattered from Marquesas Key to the Dry Tortugas. The &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; had lost all of her 265 crew and passengers except for three sailors and two slaves, who survived by clinging to the mizzenmast. Among the sailors killed in the disaster was Bartolomé García de Nodal, explorer of the Straits of Magellan surrounding Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America. All of her treasure sank with the ship, approximately from Havana.

After the surviving ships brought the news of the disaster back to Havana, Spanish authorities dispatched another five ships to salvage &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; and , which had run aground nearby. &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; had sunk in approximately of water, making it difficult for divers to retrieve any of the cargo or guns from the ship. A second hurricane on 5 October of that year made attempts at salvage even more difficult by scattering the wreckage of the sunken ship still further.

The Spaniards undertook salvage operations for several years with the use of enslaved people, and recovered nearly half of the registered part of its cargo from the holds of &quot;Santa Margarita&quot;. The principal method used for the recovery of this cargo was a large brass diving bell with a glass window on one side: an enslaved person would be forced to ride to the bottom, recover an item, and return to the surface by being hauled up by the men on deck. It was often lethal; dead slaves were actually recorded as a business expense by the captains of salvage ships.

The loss of the 1622 fleet was a severe blow to Spanish commercial interests, forcing the crown to borrow more to finance its role in the ongoing Thirty Years&#x27; War and to sell several galleons to raise funds. The Spanish worked diligently and were able to salvage most of the &quot;Santa Margarita&quot; over the next ten years. However, in 60 years of searching, the Spanish never located the &quot;Atocha&quot;.

==Modern recovery and legal battle==

Beginning in 1969, American treasure hunters Mel Fisher, Finley Ricard and a team of sub-contractors, funded by investors and others in a joint venture, Treasure Salvors, Inc., searched the sea bed for &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; for sixteen and a half years. In 1970, Fisher had recovered portions of the wrecked cargo of the sister ship &quot;Santa Margarita&quot;. He also proposed the idea to several other potential helpers, who were discouraged by the fact that this dangerous professional diving job would be paid at minimum wage unless the ship could be found. Silver bars apparently from the &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; were found in 1973, and five bronze cannons whose markings would prove to be that of the &quot;Atocha&quot; were found by Fisher&#x27;s son Dirk in 1975. Subsequently, a substantial part of its remaining cargo of silver, gold and emeralds was discovered. It was Fisher&#x27;s son, Kane, who radioed the news to Treasure Salvors headquarters on the Florida coast, from the salvage boat &quot;Dauntless&quot;.

The salvaged coins, both gold and silver, were minted primarily between 1598 and 1621, although numerous earlier dates were represented as well, some of the dates extending well back into the 16th century. Many of the dates and types of the period had been either rare or unknown prior to the salvage of the wreck. It is understood by experts that the sterncastle, the part of the ship that would hold most of the gold and rare Muzo emeralds, is still missing from the shipwreck. These and other valuable items would have been stored in the captain&#x27;s cabin for safekeeping in the rear part of &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot;.

After the discovery, the State of Florida claimed title to the wreck and forced Treasure Salvors, Inc. into a contract giving 25% of the found treasure to the state. Treasure Salvors fought the state, claiming the find should belong to those that discovered the treasure exclusively. After eight years of litigation, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favour of Treasure Salvors on 1 July 1992, and it was awarded rights to all found treasure from the vessel. Fisher died on 19 December 1998.

In June 2011, divers from Mel Fisher&#x27;s Treasure Salvors found an antique emerald ring believed to be from the wreck. It is said that the ring is worth an estimated $500,000. The ring was found from Key West, along with two silver spoons and other artifacts. In 2014, &quot;Nuestra Señora de Atocha&quot; was added to the Guinness Book of World Records for being the most valuable shipwreck to be recovered, as it was carrying roughly 40 tonnes of gold and silver, and of emeralds, although this record has now been superseded by the discovery of the &quot;San José&quot; in 2015.

<text>Kermit Houston Hunter (3 October 1910 – 11 April 2001) was an American playwright known primarily for writing historical outdoor dramas. His many works include two dramas for Cherokee tribes, one for the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina and one written for the larger Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. 
==Early life, education and military service==
Born in McDowell County, West Virginia, in 1910, Hunter attended local schools. He started higher education at Emory &amp; Henry College in Emory, Virginia. He transferred to Ohio State University, where he graduated in 1931. At Ohio State, Hunter was initiated into the Theta Delta chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. After graduation, he held a number of jobs during the difficult years of the Great Depression.

Hunter joined the U.S. Army in 1940. After rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel during World War II, he was assigned as the assistant chief of staff of the Caribbean Defense Command. He was later awarded the Legion of Merit.

==Graduate work and academic career==
After World War II, Hunter left the military and served as the business manager for the North Carolina Symphony. In 1947, Hunter decided to pursue graduate studies under the GI Bill in the Department of Dramatic Arts at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While he was enrolled, three of his plays were produced by the Carolina Playmakers, a dramatic group at the university.

The Cherokee Historical Association was looking for a playwright to write an historical outdoor drama about their people, to be performed in Cherokee, North Carolina, and Hunter won the commission. He wrote &quot;Unto These Hills&quot; (1950), which included history of the Cherokee from the early 19th century and illustrious ancestors. The play opened July 1, 1950, and is still produced at the Mountainside Theatre. This facility is owned and operated by the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI).

The Cherokee Nation based in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the largest tribe, also commissioned Hunter to write a drama. He completed &quot;The Trail of Tears&quot;. This drama covered their history and especially their forced removal to Oklahoma in 1838, then known as Indian Territory. This play was performed each summer from 1969 through 2005 at the Cherokee Heritage Center located south of Tahlequah.

After completing his master&#x27;s degree, Hunter continued graduate studies at Chapel Hill. He received his Ph.D. in 1955, and started working as a professor of drama at Hollins College (now Hollins University) in Roanoke, Virginia.

In 1964, Hunter became the first dean of the Meadows School of Arts at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. After stepping down as dean in 1976, he served as a writer-in-residence at the university until 1978. He was named as a senior lecturer at the University of Texas at Arlington, where he taught until 1993. He died in Dallas on April 11, 2001.

Hunter wrote more than 40 historical dramas, which were performed in communities throughout the United States. It became a popular form in the second half of the 20th century, as Americans reflected on their history and widened their interest in groups who were part of that history. Of these, three continue to be produced: &quot;Unto These Hills&quot;, &quot;Horn in the West&quot; in Boone, North Carolina; and &quot;Honey in the Rock&quot; in Beckley, West Virginia. In other areas, changing tastes and competition from new media reduced the audiences so that local productions closed.

<doc id="631552" wikidata="Q1682303" url="?curid=631552" title="Tempo (chess)">
<text>In chess and other chess-like games, a tempo (from ) is a &quot;turn&quot; or single move (a half-move or ply made either by White or Black). When a player achieves a desired result in one fewer move, the player is said to &quot;gain a tempo&quot;; conversely, when a player takes one more move than necessary, the player is said to &quot;lose a tempo&quot;. Similarly, when a player forces their opponent to make moves not according to their initial plan, one is said to &quot;gain tempo&quot; because the opponent is wasting moves. A move that gains a tempo is often called &quot;a move with tempo&quot;.

A simple example of losing a tempo may be moving a rook from the h1-square to h5 and from there to h8 in the first diagram; simply moving from h1 to h8 would have achieved the same result with a tempo to spare. However, such maneuvers do not always lose a tempo—the rook on h5 may make some threat which needs to be responded to. In this case, since both players have &quot;lost&quot; a tempo, the net result in terms of time is nil, but the change brought about in the position may favor one player more than the other.
==Gaining a tempo==

Gaining tempo may be achieved, for example, by developing a piece while delivering check, though here, too, if the check can be countered by the development of a piece, the net result may be nil. If the check can be blocked by a useful pawn move which also drives the checking piece away, the check may even lose a tempo.

In general, making moves with gain of tempo is desirable. A player is said to have the &quot;&quot; if they are able to keep making moves which force their opponent to respond in a particular way or limit their responses. The player with the initiative has greater choice of moves and can to some extent control the direction the game takes, though this advantage is only relative and may not be worth very much (having a slight initiative when a rook down in material, for example, may be worthless).

A move that comes &quot;with a tempo on a piece&quot; is a move that gains a tempo by attacking that piece. For example, in the Scandinavian Defense opening, after 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5, White&#x27;s 3.Nc3 comes &quot;with a tempo on the queen&quot;: the knight attacks Black&#x27;s queen, forcing it to move again, and White gains a tempo. A similar move gains a tempo in the Center Game.
==Losing a tempo==
In some endgame situations, a player must actually &quot;lose&quot; a tempo to make progress. For example, when the two kings stand in opposition (a form of zugzwang), the player to move is often at a disadvantage because he &quot;must&quot; move. The player to move may be able to triangulate in order to lose a tempo and return to the same position but with the opponent to move (and put him in zugzwang). Kings, queens, bishops, and rooks can lose a tempo; a knight cannot.
In the position from Artyom Timofeev–Ernesto Inarkiev, 2008, Black resigned because White will win with a tempo move. (Timofeev won the 2008 Moscow Open with this game.) White is threatening 118.Rh8+. If Black moves his king on move 117, White wins the bishop with 118.Rh8+, which results in a position which has an elementary checkmate. If Black moves 117...Bh5 then 118.Rh8 and Black is in zugzwang, and loses. So Black must move 117...Be2 to avoid immediately getting into a lost position. But then will come 118.Rh8+ Bh5 and now White makes a tempo move with 119.Rh7 (or 119.Rh6), maintaining the pin on the bishop, making it Black&#x27;s turn to move, and Black must lose the bishop.
==Spare tempo==

A spare tempo in an endgame arises when a player has a pawn move that does not essentially change the position but that loses a tempo to put the opponent in zugzwang. In this example, if only the pieces were considered, it would be an instance of full-point reciprocal zugzwang – the player to move would lose. In the full position, White has two spare tempi (f2–f3 and h2–h3) whereas Black has only one (...f7–f6), so White has a spare tempo. By using these moves he can Black into a fatal zugzwang:
: 1. h3 f6
: 2. f3 
and any move Black makes will lose.

If the black pawn had been on h7 instead of h6, White and Black would have an equal number of spare tempi, so the player to move would lose.
==Reserve tempo==

A pawn may have a &quot;reserve tempo&quot;, mainly in endgames involving only kings and pawns. This is especially true of a pawn on the second , where it has the option of moving one or two squares. Pawn moves held in reserve may be used to win a game.

In this position from a 1986 game between John Nunn and Klaus Bischoff, Black resigned because he must lose his pawn on the d- because White has a reserve tempo with his a-pawn. For example, after 
: 39... Kc6
: 40. Kd4 a5
: 41. a4
or
: 39... Kc7
: 40. Kd4 Kc6
: 41. a3 a5 
: 42. a4

Black must now abandon the d5-pawn (or first move and lose his pawn on f7). White is able to place Black in zugzwang because he has the option of moving the a2-pawn either one or two squares.

<text>Manuel Chaves González (born 7 July 1945) is a Spanish politician who served as Third Deputy Prime Minister of Spain from 2009 to 2011 and Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain in 2011. He is a member of the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and was the Chairman of PSOE from 2000 to 2012. From 1990 to 2009 he was the President of the Regional Government of Andalusia.
He is a trustee of the Fundacion IDEAS, a socialist think tank. On 17 February 2015, together with former President of Andalusia, José Antonio Griñán, was implicated in the ERE case, a huge corruption scandal in the region.

==National MP==
Chaves entered national politics in 1977 when he was elected to the Spanish Congress of Deputies, representing Cádiz serving in Congress until 1990.

==Minister of the Spanish Government (1986-1990)==
Manuel served as the Minister of Work and National Health Service (Seguridad Social) of Spain between 1986 and 1990, under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez.

In 1988, he suffered a general strike (first in the current Spanish democracy) call by, among others, the UGT and CCOO due to a proposed law change.

<text>Westmob, is a primarily African-American street gang located in San Francisco, California. Since 1999, they have been in conflict against the Big Block gang which is its major rival in the area. Westmob is known to associate with the Oakdale Mob and Sunnydale Gangsters. Its rivalry with Big Block was the subject of the 2002 documentary &quot;Straight Outta Hunters Point&quot; and is linked to rap and drugs.

<text>CITS-DT (channel 14) is a religious television station in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, serving as the flagship station of Yes TV. Owned by Crossroads Christian Communications, the station has studios on North Service Road (adjacent to Highway 403) in Burlington, and its transmitter is located on Highway 5 near Millgrove Side Road in Dundas, Ontario.

CITS-DT also operates rebroadcasters in Ottawa and London, extending the station&#x27;s coverage to almost all of Southern Ontario as well as portions of Western New York.

==History==

On December 4, 1996, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) denied Crossroads Christian Communications a licence to operate a religious television station in Burlington. Two years later on April 2, 1998, the company became successful in obtaining a licence for Hamilton, beating out Trinity Television Inc. for the licence. CITS-TV first signed on the air on September 30 of that year, as a religious independent station. It had planned to launch two weeks earlier on September 14, but the sign-on date was pushed back to allow cable providers to make changes to some of their channel designations.

Throughout the years, CITS-TV expanded its coverage across southern Ontario by adding rebroadcast transmitters in London and Ottawa and by securing carriage on various cable providers across Ontario and Canada and on satellite.

CTS was rebranded as &quot;Yes TV&quot; on September 1, 2014. The rebranding coincides with the introduction of several secular programs into the schedule such as &quot;American Idol&quot;, &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; and &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;.

==Programming==
Yes TV airs programming intended for family viewing, mostly based on Christian values, including dramas, comedies, mini-series and reality, game, and talk shows; although Yes TV also features shows on political commentary and other religions, including Judaism, Islam and Sikhism. Yes TV also airs secular mainstream programs during prime time hours. It is governed by the CRTC&#x27;s Religious Broadcast Regulations and follows a policy of not airing shows containing &quot;coarse language, gratuitous violence or explicit sexual scenes&quot;.

Most syndicated programs are timed to air on CITS for maximum simultaneous substitution benefits to coincide with the timing of the airings in the nearest American market, Buffalo, New York.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CITS-TV began broadcasting its digital signal on UHF channel 35 in January 2008. CITS shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 36, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts; The station relocated its digital signal from its pre-transition UHF channel 35 to its former analogue-era UHF channel 36 for post-transition operations. CITS and its digital rebroadcast transmitters switched to digital as follows: Ottawa repeater CITS-DT-1&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 42, remapping to virtual channel 42.1; while London repeater CITS-DT-2&#x27;s digital signal remained on UHF channel 14, remapping to virtual channel 14.1.

===Spectrum reallocation===
As part of the joint effort between the United States and Canada to repurpose the 600 MHz band, CITS-DT was required to change its broadcast frequencies in all three markets that it serves. On July 29, 2019, the Hamilton transmitter (CITS-DT) moved from UHF 36 to UHF 14, while the London transmitter (CITS-DT-2) moved from UHF 14 to UHF 19. On May 25, 2020, the Ottawa transmitter (CITS-DT-1) moved from UHF 42 to UHF 15. In all three cases, the virtual channel is identical to the physical channel, appended with the .1 decimal.

<text>Abu Ghraib ( or ; ) is a city in the Baghdad Governorate of Iraq, located just west of Baghdad&#x27;s city center, or northwest of Baghdad International Airport. It has a population of 189,000 (2003). The old road to Jordan passes through Abu Ghraib. The government of Iraq created the city and Abu Ghraib District in 1944.

The placename has been translated as &quot;father of little crows&quot; (in the sense of &quot;place abundant in small crows&quot;), but this translation has been suspected of being a folk etymology, and the name may be related to &quot;gharb&quot; (&quot;west&quot;), or &quot;ghariib&quot; (&quot;strange, foreign&quot;) instead.

Abu Ghraib was known for the Abu Ghraib Infant Formula Plant, which Western intelligence agencies perennially claimed to be a biological weapons production facility. The plant was built in 1980 and painted with a dappled camouflage pattern during the Iran–Iraq War. It was bombed during the Gulf War, and the Iraqi government allowed CNN reporter Peter Arnett to film the destroyed building along with a conspicuous hand-painted sign that read, &quot;baby milk factory&quot;. Iraq partially rebuilt the facility afterward, and US Secretary of State Colin Powell falsely cited it again as a weapons production plant in the run-up to the Iraq War, even though the CIA&#x27;s own investigation had concluded that the site had been bombed “in the mistaken belief that it was a key BW [Biological Weapon] facility.” Also, an examination of suspected weapons facilities by the Iraq Survey Group later determined that the plant, in disuse for some time, housed discarded infant formula, but found no evidence of weapons production.

The city is also the site of Abu Ghraib prison, which was one of the sites where political dissidents were incarcerated under former ruler Saddam Hussein. Thousands of these dissidents were tortured and executed. After Saddam Hussein&#x27;s fall, the Abu Ghraib prison was used by American forces in Iraq. In 2003, Abu Ghraib prison earned international notoriety for the torture and abuses by members of the United States Army during the post-invasion period.

<doc id="631591" wikidata="Q900897" url="?curid=631591" title="Van Eck phreaking">
<text>Van Eck phreaking, also known as Van Eck radiation, is a form of network eavesdropping in which special equipment is used for a side-channel attack on the electromagnetic emissions of electronic devices. While electromagnetic emissions are present in keyboards, printers, and other electronic devices, the most notable use of Van Eck phreaking is in reproducing the contents of a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display at a distance.

Information that drives a CRT video display takes the form of electrical signals in the RF range. The electric signal which drives the electron beam is amplified to up to around one hundred volts from TTL circuitry. The signal leaks out from displays and may be captured by an antenna, and once synchronization pulses are recreated and mixed in, an ordinary analog television receiver can display the result. These emissions are correlated to the video image being displayed, so, in theory, they can be used to recover the displayed image.

While the phenomenon had been known by the United States Government and Bell Labs as early as the Second World War, the process received its name after Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors in 1985. While phreaking is the process of exploiting telephone networks, the term is used here because of its connection to eavesdropping.

== History ==

Government researchers were already aware of the danger, as Bell Labs had noted this vulnerability to secure teleprinter communications during World War II and was able to produce 75% of the plaintext being processed in a secure facility from a distance of 80 feet (24 metres). Additionally, the NSA published &quot;Tempest Fundamentals, NSA-82-89, NACSIM 5000, National Security Agency&quot; (Classified) on February 1, 1982. Also, the van Eck technique was successfully demonstrated to non-TEMPEST personnel in Korea during the Korean War in the 1950s.

In 1985, Wim van Eck published the first unclassified technical analysis of the security risks of emanations from computer monitors. This paper caused some consternation in the security community, which had previously believed that such monitoring was a highly sophisticated attack available only to governments; van Eck successfully eavesdropped on a real system, at a range of hundreds of metres, using just $15 worth of equipment plus a television set.

In the paper, Van Eck reports that in February 1985, a successful test of this concept was carried out with the cooperation of the BBC. Using a van filled with electronic equipment and equipped with a VHF antenna array, they were able to eavesdrop from a &quot;large distance&quot;. There is no evidence that the BBC&#x27;s TV detector vans used this technology, although the BBC will not reveal whether or not they are a hoax.

Van Eck phreaking and protecting a CRT display from it was demonstrated on an episode of Tech TV&#x27;s &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; on December 18, 2003.

== Basic principle ==

Information that drives the video display takes the form of high-frequency electrical signals. The oscillation of these electric currents create electromagnetic radiation in the RF range. These radio emissions are correlated to the video image being displayed, so, in theory, they can be used to recover the displayed image.

In a CRT, the image is generated by an electron beam that sweeps back and forth across the screen. The electron beam excites the phosphor coating on the glass and causes it to glow. The strength of the beam determines the brightness of individual pixels (see Cathode-ray tube for a detailed description). The electric signal that drives the electron beam is amplified to up to around one hundred volts from TTL circuitry. This high-frequency, high-voltage signal creates electromagnetic radiation that has, according to Van Eck, &quot;a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal&quot;. The signal leaks out from displays and may be captured by an antenna, and once synchronization pulses are recreated and mixed in, an ordinary analog television receiver can display the result. The synchronization pulses can be recreated either through manual adjustment or by processing the signals emitted by electromagnetic coils as they deflect the CRT&#x27;s electron beam back and forth.

== Use as communication ==

In January 2015, the Airhopper project from Georgia Institute of Technology, United States demonstrated (at Ben Gurion University, Israel) the use of Van Eck Phreaking to enable a keylogger to communicate, through video signal manipulation, keys pressed on the keyboard of a standard PC, to a program running on an Android cellphone with an earbud radio antenna.

== Equipment ==

A tailored access battery is a special laptop battery with Van Eck Phreaking electronics and power-side band encryption cracking electronics built into its casing, in combination with a remote transceiver. This allows for quick installation and removal of a spying device by simply swapping the battery.

== Potential risks ==

Van Eck phreaking might be used to compromise the secrecy of the votes in an election using electronic voting. This caused the Dutch government to ban the use of NewVote computer voting machines manufactured by SDU in the 2006 national elections, under the belief that ballot information might not be kept secret. In a 2009 test of electronic voting systems in Brazil, Van Eck phreaking was used to successfully compromise ballot secrecy as a proof of concept.

== Further research ==

In April 2004, academic research revealed that flat panel and laptop displays are also vulnerable to electromagnetic eavesdropping. The required equipment for espionage was constructed in a university lab for less than US$2000.

Markus Kuhn has discovered several low-cost techniques for reducing the chances that emanations from computer displays can be monitored remotely. With CRT displays and analog video cables, filtering out high-frequency components from fonts before rendering them on a computer screen will attenuate the energy at which text characters are broadcast. With modern flat panel displays, the high-speed digital serial interface (DVI) cables from the graphics controller are a main source of compromising emanations. Adding random noise to the least significant bits of pixel values may render the emanations from flat-panel displays unintelligible to eavesdroppers but is not a secure method. Since DVI uses a certain bit code scheme that tries to transport a balanced signal of 0 bits and 1 bits, there may not be much difference between two pixel colors that differ very much in their color or intensity. The emanations can differ drastically even if only the last bit of a pixel&#x27;s color is changed. The signal received by the eavesdropper also depends on the frequency where the emanations are detected. The signal can be received on many frequencies at once and each frequency&#x27;s signal differs in contrast and brightness related to a certain color on the screen. Usually, the technique of smothering the RED signal with noise is not effective unless the power of the noise is sufficient to drive the eavesdropper&#x27;s receiver into saturation thus overwhelming the receiver input.

<text>Pro-Europeanism, sometimes called European Unionism, is a political position that favours European integration and membership of the European Union (EU). The opposite of Pro-Europeanism is Euroscepticism.

== Political position ==

Pro-Europeans are mostly classified as centrist (Renew Europe) in the context of European politics, including centre-right liberal conservatives (EPP Group) and centre-left social democrats (S&amp;D and Greens/EFA). Pro-Europeanism is ideologically closely related to the European and Global liberal movement.

<text>Pascal Affi N&#x27;Guessan (born 1 January 1953) is an Ivorian politician who is the President of the Ivorian Popular Front (FPI). He was the Prime Minister of the Ivory Coast from 27 October 2000 to 10 February 2003.

==Biography==
N&#x27;Guessan was born in Bouadikro in the sub-prefecture of Bongouanou. In 1986, he joined the FPI. He was Mayor of Bongouanou from 1990 to 1996 and Vice-President of the Union of Towns and Communes of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (UVICOCI) from 1990 to 1995.

==Political career==
N&#x27;Guessan joined the Secretariat-General of the FPI in 1990, and in 1994 he became Deputy Secretary-General. In January 2000, after a military coup in December 1999, he became Minister of Industry and Tourism under military leader Robert Gueï, serving in that position until October 2000. N&#x27;Guessan was the campaign director for FPI candidate Laurent Gbagbo in the October 2000 presidential election, and after Gbagbo&#x27;s victory he was appointed prime minister.

Gbagbo was constitutionally barred from being party leader after he became president, and at the FPI&#x27;s Third Extraordinary Congress, held from 20 to 22 July 2001, N&#x27;Guessan was elected as President of the FPI, receiving 94.55% of the vote. He was elected as a Vice-President of the Socialist International at its 22nd Congress, held from 27 to 29 October 2003 in São Paulo, Brazil.

Following the overthrow of the Gbagbo regime in April 2011 by forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara backed by French and UN forces, N&#x27;Guessan was arrested and held at a detention centre in Bouna, north-east Ivory Coast.

On 8 August 2015, N&#x27;Guessan was designated as the FPI&#x27;s presidential candidate for the October 2015 presidential election. He denounced the incarceration of Gbagbo by the International Criminal Court and political conditions under Ouattara: &quot;Peace isn&#x27;t only the silence of weapons. Can we say that Ivory Coast is in peace when President Gbagbo is in The Hague? With hundreds of political prisoners in jail, Ivory Coast is not in peace.&quot; Some hardliners in the FPI did not want to participate in elections as long as Gbagbo remained imprisoned, but others felt the party needed to remain engaged in the electoral process.

In the December 2016 parliamentary election, N&#x27;Guessan was elected to the National Assembly as an FPI candidate in Bongouanou Department, receiving 59% of the vote.

He was arrested during the night of 6 to 7 November, shortly after the 2020 Ivorian presidential election. He was allegedly arrested for forming a rival government to that of President Alassane Ouattara.

In October 2021, N&#x27;Guessan announced his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election.

In November 2024, Pascal Affi N&#x27;Guessan was re-elected as president of the Ivorian Popular Front with 99% of the vote..

<doc id="631620" wikidata="Q5902039" url="?curid=631620" title="Horace Panter">
<text>Stephen Graham &quot;Horace&quot; Panter, (born 30 August 1953) also known professionally as Sir Horace Gentleman, is the bassist for the British 2 Tone ska band The Specials.

==Early life==
Panter was born in Croydon, Surrey and spent most of his formative years in Kettering, Northamptonshire starting a one-year art course at Northampton College in 1971. In 1972, he began studying fine art at Coventry&#x27;s Lanchester Polytechnic (now Coventry University).

==Music==

In his second year at Lanchester Polytechnic he met Jerry Dammers and together they formed The Specials. The band started playing in Coventry bars and clubs before releasing their first single, &#x27;Gangsters&#x27; on their own record label (2-Tone). Following the break-up of The Specials in 1981, Panter went on to play with General Public with Dave Wakeling and Ranking Roger from the original Beat, and then with the reformed Specials in the 1990s. Panter then joined forces with Neol Davies of The Selecter to form a Blues band, Box of Blues. Today, he is a full-time member of the reformed Specials and is also in a blues combo, called &#x27;Blues 2 Go&#x27;. He has also played with Malik &amp; Pettite (formerly The Tones), and is in the process of getting together a ska orchestra called &#x27;The Uptown Ska Collective&#x27; who began touring in 2014.

Panter has been playing with The Dirt Road Band since 2022, although an earlier incarnation of the band briefly appeared in 2017 and played the odd gig in the Midlands. The band have recently released their debut album, &quot;Righteous&quot;.

==Teaching, autobiography and art==
During the 1990s, Panter qualified as a teacher and taught art to special needs children at Corley Special School in North Warwickshire from 1998 to 2008. 

He has written an autobiography, &quot;Ska&#x27;d for Life&quot;, in which he described his involvement in the creation of the punk-ska hybrid that became known as &#x27;2-Tone, and described his experiences since the band&#x27;s creation. 

An occupation of Panter&#x27;s alongside his performing with the Specials is art. He has been a professional artist since 2010 and has exhibited throughout the UK. His work is based on traditional forms of iconography fused with the sensibilities of British pop art.

<doc id="631621" wikidata="Q1052356" url="?curid=631621" title="Cecil Spring Rice">
<text>Sir Cecil Arthur Spring Rice, (27 February 1859 – 14 February 1918) was a British diplomat who served as British Ambassador to the United States from 1912 to 1918, as which he was responsible for the organisation of British efforts to end American neutrality during the First World War.

He was also a close friend of US President Theodore Roosevelt, and served as best man at his second wedding.

He is best known as the writer of the lyrics of the patriotic hymn &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot;.

==Early life and family==
Spring Rice was born into an aristocratic and influential Anglo-Irish family. He was the son of a diplomat, The Hon. Charles William Thomas Spring Rice, who was the second son of the prominent Whig politician and former cabinet minister Lord Monteagle of Brandon. Spring Rice&#x27;s maternal grandfather was the politician William Marshall, and he was a cousin of Frederick Spring. He was the great-grandson of The 1st Earl of Limerick, John Marshall, and George Hibbert. Spring Rice&#x27;s father died when he was eleven, and he was raised at his mother&#x27;s family&#x27;s house at Watermillock on the shore of Ullswater. During his childhood, he was often ill, and he later suffered from Graves&#x27; disease, despite maintaining an active lifestyle.

He was educated at Eton and at Balliol College, Oxford, at both of which he was a contemporary and close friend of George Nathaniel Curzon, and at the latter of which he studied under the direction of Benjamin Jowett. Spring Rice rowed for Balliol, and achieved a double first in Classical Moderations (1879) and &quot;Literae Humaniores&quot; (1881). At Oxford, he was also a contemporary and close friend of John Strachey and Edward Grey. However, Spring Rice contributed, alongside John William Mackail, to the composition of a famous sardonic doggerel about Curzon that was published in &quot;The Balliol Masque&quot;, and, when British Ambassador to the United States, he was suspected by Curzon of trying to prevent Curzon&#x27;s engagement to the American Mary Leiter, whom Curzon nevertheless married. However, Spring Rice assumed for a certainty, like many of Curzon&#x27;s other friends, that Curzon would inevitably become Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs: he wrote to Curzon in 1891, &#x27;When you are Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs I hope you will restore the vanished glory of England, lead the European concert, decide the fate of nations, and give me three months&#x27; leave instead of two&#x27;.

After completing university, Spring Rice travelled in Europe, where he improved his French, at the time the language of diplomacy. Uncertain about which career to pursue, he took an examination for the Foreign Office and was accepted. Although brought up as an Englishman, Spring Rice maintained a close affinity with Ireland, and he later wrote a poem about his dual Rice (Irish) and Spring (English) roots.

Spring Rice had four sisters and four brothers, two of whom predeceased him. Stephen Spring Rice died in 1902 and Gerald Spring Rice was killed while serving as an officer on the Western Front in 1916.

===Marriage and issue===
In 1904, Spring Rice married Florence Caroline Lascelles, the daughter of Sir Frank Cavendish Lascelles and a cousin of the Duke of Devonshire. He had two children with Florence:

*Mary Elizabeth Spring Rice (1906–1994), married Sir Oswald Raynor Arthur in 1935.
*Anthony Theodore Brandon Spring Rice (1908–1954), died unmarried.

==Career==

===Early diplomatic career===

Spring Rice began his career as a clerk in the Foreign Office in 1882. In 1886, he was appointed Assistant Private Secretary to the Foreign Secretary, the Liberal politician Lord Rosebery. Spring Rice was known to be a supporter of the Liberal Party and was sympathetic to the Irish Home Rule movement so he was relieved of his post when the Conservatives came to power later that year. Spring Rice subsequently made the unusual move to the diplomatic service, where he remained for the rest of his life, starting with his first posting to the British legation in Washington, D.C. in 1887.

In 1892 he was posted to Japan, and undertook a tour of Korea with Curzon later that year. While in Japan Spring Rice was instrumental in laying the foundations of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which he identified as vital to British interests if Russian expansionism in the region was to be challenged. He left Japan in October 1893 and was posted again to Washington until October 1895, when he was posted to the British embassy in Berlin. During his time in Germany he fell in love with his future wife, Florence Lascelles, the daughter of the then British ambassador. He left Berlin in July 1898, and after spending several months with his family on Ullswater was posted to Constantinople. In May 1899 he was given his first posting to Persia as Secretary of Legation, and he became the British chargé d&#x27;affaires in Tehran in March 1900, when the Minister, Sir Mortimer Durand, left for London due to his wife&#x27;s health. In 1901 Spring Rice was appointed Commissioner of Public Debt in Cairo, where he remained for two years. In November 1901, he had been promoted to the rank of Secretary of Embassy. He was made Chargé d&#x27;Affaires in St. Petersburg in 1903, and in June of that year began to warn the British government that war between Russia and Japan was becoming increasingly likely. He was still serving in Russia when the Russo-Japanese War began in January 1904, and he corresponded at length with his close friend and confidant President Roosevelt about the United States&#x27; mediation in the conflict and the subsequent Treaty of Portsmouth. In January 1905 Lord Lansdowne appointed Spring Rice as the Foreign Office&#x27;s special representative to the US president. Spring Rice was carrying out the duties of the British ambassador to Russia, who was unwell, during the 1905 Russian Revolution and was involved in the early negotiations which resulted in the Anglo-Russian Entente of 1907.

In September 1906 Spring Rice undertook his first ambassadorial role when he was made British Minister to Persia, before becoming Ambassador to Sweden in 1908.

===Ambassador to Sweden===
Upon being appointed ambassador, Spring Rice was instructed by Edward VII to help improve relations between Sweden and Norway following the dissolution of the Union between the two countries in 1905. The primary concern of the British government, however, was the increasingly friendly relations between Sweden and Germany, and the growing diplomatic, cultural and economic influence of Germany in Scandinavia. In a letter to Lord Cranley in May 1909, Spring Rice stated &quot;I suppose you realise that Sweden is in effect a province of Prussia [Germany], not in will but in necessity&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;in case of war I think we should regard Sweden as German in effect...&quot;. Spring Rice became irritated by what he saw as Sweden&#x27;s deference to Wilhelm II, and his embassy was involved in an intensifying rivalry between Germany and Britain for control of Sweden&#x27;s important iron and timber resources. Nonetheless, relations between Sweden and London remained amicable.

In November 1912, after four years in Sweden, it was announced that Spring Rice&#x27;s next diplomatic posting was to be as ambassador to the United States.

===Ambassador to the United States===

Spring Rice had long held the ambition of being appointed ambassador to the United States. In his biography of Spring Rice, Stephen Gwynn stated that Spring Rice&#x27;s main concern, throughout his diplomatic career, was to &quot;improve relations between the two great English-speaking powers&quot;. Within the diplomatic service Spring Rice had unique entrée into Washington&#x27;s corridors of power, and his work alongside President Roosevelt in 1905 led the British government to regard him as a natural choice for ambassador by 1912. The diplomat Sir Ignatius Valentine Chirol observed that Spring Rice&#x27;s &quot;whole career seems to have been a preparation for the final struggle in Washington&quot;.

Within two years of Spring Rice&#x27;s posting to Washington DC, the First World War had broken out in Europe, and his principal task became that of ending American neutrality. The United States was the largest potential supplier of munitions, arms and food to the United Kingdom and its allies, as well as a potential ally in the war. However, in 1914 public opinion in America favoured neutrality, and Spring Rice had to grapple with the strong anti-British and non-interventionist elements in American politics at the time. Spring Rice also had the complex task of justifying British policies that violated America&#x27;s rights as a neutral state, such as the monitoring of mail and telegrams and the seizure of contraband at sea. Furthermore, German diplomats under Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff were active in attempting to influence American political opinion against the Allies. Of particular concern to Spring Rice was liaison between German and Irish groups in America, and his embassy was closely involved in gathering intelligence regarding the actions of anti-British spies and informants. He successfully engaged with his many Atlanticist American friends, including Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Stimson and Joseph Hodges Choate, who applied pressure on Woodrow Wilson to abandon neutrality.

In January 1915 Arthur Balfour, the former prime minister, was sent on a mission to convince the United States Congress of Britain&#x27;s friendship. In a series of meetings, Spring Rice and Consul-General, Sir Courtenay Bennett, were marginalised by the delegation&#x27;s representatives. Spring Rice and Bennett agreed to support the subsequent Commercial Agreement on the condition that Spring Rice&#x27;s friend, J. P. Morgan Jr., was appointed as the sole purchasing agent. Spring Rice was able to keep the feeble commission alive, but voiced his concerns that British finances in the United States were reaching a critical point as chaotic credit arrangements by-passed the body set up by parliament to effectuate co-ordination. Spring Rice sent daily wires to London warning that Gold runs would seriously undermine British bank facility, but these were largely ignored. Spring Rice had served as best man at J. P. Morgan&#x27;s wedding and his influence over the commission was too great for him to be seen as impartial.

As the war went on, Spring Rice&#x27;s embassy increasingly assumed an advisory role to the many British special delegations which were sent to secure the support of the US government. Spring Rice complained about the limited part he was able to play in the 1915 Anglo-French Financial Commission led by Lord Reading. Spring Rice was also concerned by the large number of private brokers and agents, both with and without official authority, who were operating in the United States on behalf of the government and British businesses. As a result, Spring Rice had to request for the War Office to provide him with an official list of accredited agents, which was reluctantly compiled in late 1914.
By 1916, the British government was becoming increasingly worried about the Ghadar Party, a US-based political movement which was agitating for rebellion against British rule in India. The American authorities had been reluctant to check the Indian seditionist movement earlier in the war, and fear about the potential political fallout had prevented Spring Rice from pressing the matter diplomatically. However, in February 1916 Spring Rice was ordered to raise the issue with the new US Secretary of State, Robert Lansing. The subsequent Hindu–German Conspiracy Trial uncovered plans to incite an armed revolt in India with German support.

In 1916, Spring Rice constantly sought a reprieve for Roger Casement, citing the danger of protests from Irish Americans, but he also advised political and religious leaders of Casement&#x27;s &quot;perversion&quot; and the existence of the &quot;Black Diaries&quot;. In January 1917 he signed the agreement of the third US War Loan to Britain on behalf of his government. Spring Rice&#x27;s efforts to end US neutrality eventually met with success when the USA entered the conflict on the side of the Allies in 1917. In mid-January 1918, following a disagreement with Lord Northcliffe, the head of the British war mission to America, he was abruptly recalled to London in a one-line telegram.

Spring Rice immediately travelled to Canada to begin his journey back to Britain. In Canada, Spring Rice was the guest of his wife&#x27;s cousin, the Duke of Devonshire, who was at the time serving as Governor General of Canada. Although only 58 and in reasonably good health, Spring Rice unexpectedly died at the viceregal seat, Rideau Hall in Ottawa, a mere three weeks after leaving his post. It is believed that his underlying health condition (Graves&#x27; disease) had been exacerbated by exhaustion and stress. It was suggested by his family and close friends that Spring Rice had died of a broken heart following his removal from office, with Henry Cabot Lodge commenting that &quot;the sudden cessation of his work and responsibilities in which his heart was bound up caused him the loss of the will to live&quot;. He is buried in Beechwood Cemetery in Ottawa. Spring Rice was replaced as ambassador by Lord Reading, who was a direct representative of Britain&#x27;s war cabinet and had been afforded additional negotiating powers, thus combining the roles previously held by Northcliffe and Spring Rice.

===Assessment of work===
In &quot;The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt&quot;, Edmund Morris described Spring Rice as &quot;a born diplomat [who] invariably picked out and cultivated the most important person in any place&quot;. He was well respected in London&#x27;s diplomatic circles, and had a wide network of influential friends in the United States and Britain. The diplomat Sir Malcolm Robertson described Spring Rice as &quot;one of the two or three really brilliant ambassadors whom I have met in thirty years of diplomatic life.&quot;

However, Spring Rice&#x27;s success in turning the earlier close links to the US administration to a relationship of use to his government is debatable. By the end of his appointment, Spring Rice had earned the enmity of his government after becoming paranoid about the threat posed by German spies, and also because of his immense dislike of the many British delegations to Washington that were not under the control of his embassy. Furthermore, Spring Rice&#x27;s personal connections to many notable Republican politicians was well known, so some members of the Democratic administration of Woodrow Wilson were dubious about trusting him. He was damaged by his association with Roosevelt following the former President&#x27;s attacks on Wilson for his policy of neutrality and for a lack of military preparedness. Spring Rice found William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of State, hard to take seriously and disliked having to deal with Edward M. House, Wilson&#x27;s confidential adviser, who held no official post in the US government. Even so, after his death the British government publicly recognised Spring Rice&#x27;s extraordinary contribution to the war effort. His untiring attempts to get the United States to join the Allies were evident as well as his success in frustrating the work of the German ambassador, von Bernstorff.

In a speech in the House of Commons in 1919, Lord Robert Cecil said:

==Writings and friendships==

Spring Rice was a poet throughout his adult life. In 1918, he rewrote the words of his most notable poem, &quot;Urbs Dei (The City of God)&quot; or &quot;The Two Fatherlands&quot;, to become the text for the hymn &quot;I Vow to Thee My Country&quot;. The hymn was first performed in 1925, after Spring Rice&#x27;s death and has since become a widely recognised British anthem. His poetry was published in the 1922 edition of &quot;Poems of Today&quot;, and has since been published in several other poetry collections.

He became acquainted with Theodore Roosevelt on a trans-Atlantic crossing from New York in 1886, and the two men quickly became close friends and confidants. He has been described as &quot;one of President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s most ardent and loyal admirers&quot; and acted as Roosevelt&#x27;s best man in Roosevelt&#x27;s wedding to Edith Carow. Roosevelt became the godfather of Spring Rice&#x27;s son in 1908. Spring Rice memorably remarked about Roosevelt: &quot;You must always remember that the president is about six&quot;. The two men continued to write to each other until Spring Rice&#x27;s death, and their close relationship undoubtedly added to the latter&#x27;s diplomatic clout in the US.

He was a close friend of Sir Ignatius Valentine Chirol, a British journalist and later diplomat, and Ronald Munro Ferguson, 1st Viscount Novar, with whom he corresponded for many years. One of his closest political friends was the Irish nationalist, John Dillon; his unwavering sense of duty attempted to overcome his sister&#x27;s very public espousal of nationalist causes and friendships within the hierarchy of Sinn Féin. The personal moral overtones and private contradictions failed to dent an overwhelming sense of obligation to the British Empire. However it may have informed his uneasy relationship with the Balfour Mission.

A fluent speaker of Persian (as well as German and French), Spring Rice was responsible for translating numerous Persian poems into English. Spring Rice&#x27;s letters and poems were collected together by his daughter, Lady Arthur, and many are now held by The National Archives. Further papers, relating to his diplomatic postings, and diaries of his travels in Japan, are held by the Churchill Archives Centre.

==Honours and legacy==

Spring Rice was appointed a Knight Commander Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 29 June 1906 and a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 17 November 1908. In 1906 he was made a Grand Cordon of Order of the Medjidie. In 1912 he was made a Commander (1st Class) of the Order of the Polar Star and he was made a member of the Imperial Privy Council on 7 March 1913. Spring Rice was going to be offered a peerage upon his return to the United Kingdom, but died before the honour could be proposed.

In his will he left money to Balliol College to found the Cecil Spring Rice Memorial Fund which funds the learning of languages by students who intend to join the diplomatic service. Before his death, Spring Rice gave substantial funds for repairs to be carried out on St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church, Lavenham, the ancestral church of the Spring family.

===Commemorations===
Shortly after his death, Spring Rice&#x27;s family, friends and colleagues erected a bridge to his memory over the waterfall at Aira Force, near his childhood home on Ullswater. All Saints Church, Watermillock, contains a stone memorial tablet to Spring Rice.

In July 2013 a memorial was unveiled by Cecil Spring Rice&#x27;s granddaughter, Caroline Kenny, at Spring Rice&#x27;s graveside in Ottawa. The grave was cleaned up and a memorial plaque and ceremony was organised by the then British Consul, Ashley Prime, working in Toronto with support from the Freeman of the City of London (North America). Mount Spring-Rice in British Columbia was named after Spring Rice in 1918 by surveyor Arthur Wheeler.

<doc id="631624" wikidata="Q1124863" url="?curid=631624" title="General Confederation of Labour (Spain)">
<text>The General Confederation of Labour (; CGT) is a Spanish trade union federation. Formed as a faction of the National Confederation of Labour (CNT) during the Spanish transition to democracy, its support for participation in led it to split from the organisation, which prohibited participation. After losing a lengthy legal battle for the name, the pro-electoral faction renamed itself to the CGT and reorganised itself as an independent trade union center.

By the 21st century, the CGT had become one of the largest trade unions in Spain, gaining more than 100,000 members and electing more than 7,000 representatives to works councils. It has gained a particularly strong influence in the automotive, telecommunication and transportation industries, which it has called to be brought under social ownership. Its support for self-determination put it in the leading role of organising the 2017 Catalan general strike and its support for feminism drove its participation in women&#x27;s strikes on each International Women&#x27;s Day.

==History==
===Establishment===
During the Spanish transition to democracy, the National Confederation of Labour (; CNT), a revolutionary anarcho-syndicalist trade union, was restructured and returned to workplace organising in Spain. By the end of the 1970s, deep generational, ideological and tactical divides had caused the CNT to fragment. At the CNT&#x27;s 5th Congress, held in Madrid in December 1979, the debate over participation in provoked a split. When the congress resolved to prohibit electoral participation, supporters of participation accused the organisers of blocking them from speaking on the matter and 53 unions abandoned the meeting.

The unions that supported electoral participation represented 8,000 members, roughly one-third of the CNT&#x27;s remaining membership. Together they established a Technical Commission (; CTI), which launched a legal challenge to the outcome of the Madrid Congress. From 25 to 27 July 1980, the CTI held an extraordinary congress in Valencia, where delegates resolved to authorise participation in union elections. The orthodox faction of the CNT responded by expelling the dissident unions, which it denounced as &quot;enemies of trade unionism&quot;. 

Members of the CTI were physically attacked and sent death threats, prompting the dissident CNT faction to establish self-defense units. To distinguish itself from the &quot;official&quot; CNT, the CTI renamed itself to the CNT-Valencia Congress (; CNT-CV). By February 1981, the conflict had escalated into open violence, forcing the &quot;official&quot; CNT prohibited further violence, except in cases of self-defense. In 1983, the &quot;official&quot; CNT itself succombed to internal disputes over participation in union elections; the &quot;renovators&quot; (advocates of participation) were prevented from voting at its extraordinary congress, provoking general secretary José Bondía to resign from the organisation. The renovators were subsequently invited to join the CNT-CV, which took place at a Unification Congress at Madrid&#x27;s Palacio de Congresos in 1984.

The legal battle between the two factions continued throughout the 1980s, finally ending in 1989, when the Supreme Court of Spain banned the dissident faction from using the name of the CNT. The pro-election faction of the CNT then reorganised itself into the General Confederation of Labour (; CGT). Its first act as the CGT was to join that year&#x27;s International Workers&#x27; Day celebrations, organised by other trade unions.

Workers&#x27; Solidarity (; SO) later split from the Madrid section of the CGT, opting to allow its members the choice of whether or not to participate in union elections. Throughout the 2000s, the CGT has established a series of syndicalist internationals, together with the Central Organisation of Swedish Workers (SAC). These included: the International Libertarian Solidarity (2001–2003); the (2003–2009); and finally the Red and Black Coordination (2010–present). The International Workers&#x27; Association (IWA), a rival anarcho-syndicalist international, has criticised the CGT&#x27;s participation in works councils as &quot;reformism&quot;, although the CGT insists it has merely adapted to new material conditions and considers itself to practice a pragmatic form of syndicalism.

===Growth===

The CGT counted 50,000 members during the 1990s; since then its membership has doubled. Following the Great Recession, the major Spanish trade unions called general strikes in 2010 and 2012, although they maintained an ambivalent position towards political and economic reform. In reaction to the moderate position of the mainstream unions, many within the rising anti-austerity movement moved towards anarcho-syndicalism, which led to a growth in the CGT&#x27;s membership. In 2012, the CGT counted 4,805 representatives in works councils (1.6% of all union representatives). In the 2015 union elections, its vote-share increased, leading to the election of 5,435 CGT representatives (2% of all union representatives).

By 2020, it counted 100,000 members, which together accounted for 3.5% of all Spanish trade union members. This made the CGT the fourth-largest trade union in Spain, behind the General Union of Workers (UGT), Workers&#x27; Commissions (CCOO) and Unión Sindical Obrera (USO). It is also the largest anarcho-syndicalist union in the country. The CGT has also increased its elected union delegates to more than 7,000 representatives; together representing millions of workers in various different industries.

The CGT&#x27;s unions are most powerful within the automotive, telecommunication and transportation industries; it also has a significant presence in the banking, cleaning, education, healthcare and public administration sectors.

In April 2023, after three decades of internecine conflict, the CGT, CNT and SO came together to form a &quot;united action pact&quot;, with the intention of defending public welfare, fighting for equality and opposing repression against the labour movement.

==Campaigns==
===Catalan self-determination===

In 1985, the CGT passed a motion that supported self-determination for the nationalities and regions of Spain. On every National Day of Catalonia (11 September) since 2004, the Catalan branch of the CGT has publicly reaffirmed their support for self-determination. In 2013, they issued a manifesto &quot;Dret a decidir&quot;, which linked Catalan self-determination with the anarchist policy of workers&#x27; self-management and called for the abolition of capitalism in Catalonia. The Catalan CGT is closely linked with the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), a left-wing nationalist party, and the two share members throughout the region. By 2017, the CGT counted 19,300 members in the region Catalonia, which made it the third-largest union in the region.

Ahead of the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, the CGT criticised the political repression of the Catalan self-determination process, which it called an &quot;attack on the rights and liberties of everybody&quot;. Emphasising their support for self-management and direct democracy, the CGT called on workers to mobilise in the streets and carry out civil disobedience &quot;in defence of the liberties that the capitalist system denies us&quot;. After the referendum, the CGT denounced the state prosecution of hundreds of officials, civil servants and school teachers who had supported the independence process.

In response to the political repression that followed the referendum, on 3 October 2017, the CGT called a general strike in Catalonia and invited all trade unions to join it. The CGT was quickly joined by the (IAC) and (COS), and soon after by the CNT, SO and Confederació Sindical Catalana (CSC). Despite the UGT and CCOO&#x27;s refusal to participate, the strike received up to 80% support from Catalan workers; according to José Antonio Gutiérrez and Jordi Martí Font, this made it &quot;the most successful strike in recent history in Spain&quot;. The CGT, CNT and SO, together with other Catalan anarchist groups, signed a manifesto expressing support for self-determination, denouncing political repression, and calling for the establishment of workers&#x27; self-management and direct democracy in Catalonia. They were supported by the Madrid sections of the CGT, CNT and SO, which held a solidarity demonstration in support of self-determination.

===Feminist general strikes===
In the mid-2010s, issues such as violence against women, the gender pay gap and unpaid domestic labour provoked a number of Spanish feminist organisations to call a general strike for International Women&#x27;s Day. On 8 March 2017, the Andalusian branch of the CGT joined the strike, but overall, trade union participation in the strike was lacking. The following year, the call for a feminist general strike was backed by the CGT, as well as the CNT and CO.BAS, which declared that its workers would cease work for 24 hours. The women&#x27;s strikes of 2018 and 2019 successfully mobilised hundreds of thousands of people, but further actions were limited by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Although subsequent strikes lost the support of the larger unions, the CGT and other smaller unions supported the 2020 women&#x27;s strike; according to the CGT, 50% of Barcelona Metro workers went on strike on 8 March 2020.

===Railway socialisation===
One of the CGT&#x27;s strongest sections is its railway union. In the 2015 , the CGT secured representation in the works councils of both Renfe and ADIF. Since 2001, the CGT has advocated for the railways to be brought under social ownership and to be maintained as a public service, with guarantees of consumer protection and workplace safety standards. Unlike the UGT and CCOO, which call for state ownership of the railways, the CGT has criticised the continued oscillation between state and private ownership of the railways throughout history as a force for capital accumulation. The CGT therefore advocates for a railway model where public service is valued above profitability; it has criticised the AVE as a profit seeking enterprise, built and maintained for an elite few.

==History==

The electoral district was created in 1871, and was one of the four original ridings allocated to Manitoba when it joined the Canadian Confederation in 1870. It is notable for being the riding that elected Louis Riel to the House of Commons as an independent.

Through its history the riding has alternated between representation by the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives (or Conservative Party of Canada).

This riding lost territory to Selkirk—Interlake—Eastman and Portage—Lisgar, and gained territory from Selkirk—Interlake during the 2012 electoral redistribution.

<doc id="631629" wikidata="Q2566753" url="?curid=631629" title="Whippany River">
<text>The Whippany River is a tributary of the Rockaway River, approximately 20 mi (30 km) long, in northern New Jersey in the United States.

It rises in Morris County, in Mendham Township west of Morristown, and flows generally ENE in a meandering course, through Morristown and the 
Whippany area of Hanover. It flows through the Troy Meadows and joins the Rockaway in the Hatfield Swamp in eastern Morris County, just above the confluence of the Rockaway with the Passaic River.

The river drainage area is .

There are three USGS water gauges on the river. The gauge in Parsippany just before the Whippany River empties into the Rockaway River has an average flow of per second.

The river derives its name from the Whippanong Native Americans, a tribe that once inhabited the area. Whippanong meant &quot;place of the willows&quot;, named for the trees growing along the banks of the river.

== History ==

=== Munsee Lenape ===
Circa 1500, the Whippany River was part of the Lenapehoking (along with the rest of New Jersey) and was inhabited by the Munsee Lenape.
The Munsee harvested mussels from the Whippany River.

=== Colonial settlement ===
In 1685, European settlers constructed homes along the Whippany River. The river provided the hydropower for the various mills of Whippany.

=== Modern history ===
In 1998, the Mayor&#x27;s Action Committee (later known as the Whippany River Watershed Action Committee) was established, with the goal of protecting the watershed. The Committee is sponsored by grants from NJDEP, Victoria Foundation, Rutgers University, Pfizer, and other corporations. It is partnered with 16 local municipalities. The Committee hosts canoe trips, festivals, hikes, educational outreach, classes, civic organizations, engineering roundtables, goose workshops, and stormwater conferences. Volunteers form a significant part of its research teams and workforce.

<text>The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool is the largest of the many reflecting pools in Washington, D.C.. It is a rectangular pool located on the National Mall, directly east of the Lincoln Memorial, with the World War II Memorial and Washington Monument to the east of the reflecting pool. 

Part of the iconic image of Washington, D.C., the reflecting pool hosts many of the 24 million visitors who visit the National Mall annually. It is lined by walking paths and shade trees on both sides. Depending on the viewer&#x27;s vantage point, it dramatically reflects the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Mall&#x27;s trees, and the expansive sky.

==Description==
The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool was designed by Henry Bacon, and was constructed in 1922 and 1923, following the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial. It is approximately long and wide. The perimeter of the pool is therefore around. It has a depth of approximately on the sides and in the center. It holds approximately of water.

==Restoration==
Using funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the National Park Service reconstructed the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The pool&#x27;s water supply system was updated to eliminate stagnant water by circulating water from the Tidal Basin; the pool was formerly filled using potable water from the city. Paved walking paths were added to the north and south sides of the pool to replace worn grass and to prevent further erosion. Construction on the 18-month, $30.74 million project began in November 2010. In May 2011, workers began sinking the first of 2,113 wood pilings into a layer of soft, marshy river clay and some dredged material atop bedrock to support a new pool. The pool reopened on August 31, 2012. The project was managed by the Louis Berger Group.

===Post-restoration operation===
Within weeks of the pool&#x27;s reopening in 2012, it had to be drained and cleaned at a cost of $100,000 due to algae in the pool. The algae growth was so extensive it almost completely covered the surface of the pool. Using an ozone disinfectant system installed during the renovation, the National Park Service said it would double the amount of algae-killing ozone in the pool to control future outbreaks.

In 2013, construction on the National World War II Memorial damaged the eastern end of the Reflecting Pool. NPS workers closed the eastern of the pool in August 2015 to repair the basin, work that was completed in the summer of 2016.

The Reflecting Pool was completely drained in June 2017 to control a parasitical outbreak. The parasite, which causes swimmer&#x27;s itch, infects snails which inhabit the pool. More than 80 ducks and ducklings have died at the pool due to parasitical infection since May 20. Park Service workers said the work and refilling of the pool would take 10 days.

==Historic events==

Located at the base of the Lincoln Memorial&#x27;s steps, the Reflecting Pool area has been the site of many historic events, including:
*In 1939, singer Marian Anderson was denied permission to perform at Constitution Hall in Washington because she was African American. An open-air concert was held on Easter Sunday, with a crowd of over 75,000 people.
*On August 28, 1963, the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom used the area for its Civil Rights rally. It was there that Martin Luther King Jr. gave his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, delivered to a crowd of 250,000 people.
*On October 21, 1967, 100,000 anti-Vietnam War protesters met at the pool and memorial to begin the March on the Pentagon.
*In 2009, We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial was held, with a crowd of 400,000 people.
*In 2010, the restoration project began.
*On August 28, 2010, the Restoring Honor rally was held. Notable speakers included Alveda King, the niece of Martin Luther King Jr., former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, and the event&#x27;s organizer Glenn Beck. 
*As of 2012, the restoration project was completed and the pool was reopened on August 31.
*On December 31, 2012, National Park Rangers, using their personal funds and time, lit over 2,000 candles around the reflecting pool in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, where the Park Service rang in the New Year with a Night Watch and Freedom Vigil and the singing of &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;.
*On August 28, 2013, the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s &quot;I Have A Dream&quot; speech was commemorated by an all-day event. The event featured various speakers including then President Barack Obama and John Lewis, the only living speaker from the original rally.
*On January 19, 2021, then President-elect Joe Biden and then Vice President-elect Kamala Harris held a memorial honoring the 400,000 Americans who had died in the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

<doc id="631653" wikidata="Q971506" url="?curid=631653" title="Grom-class destroyer">
<text>The &quot;Grom&quot;-class destroyers were two destroyers, built for the Polish Navy by the British company of J. Samuel White, Cowes. They were laid down in 1935 and commissioned in 1937. The two &quot;Grom&quot;s were some of the fastest and most heavily armed destroyers of World War II.

==Design==
Despite having ordered its previous pair of destroyers ( and ) from France, a country with which it had strong ties, Poland decided to acquire the second pair from the United Kingdom, possibly in recognition of the excellence of British destroyer designs at the time. The selected design resulted in large and powerful ships, superior to German and Soviet destroyers of the time, and comparable to the famous British of 1936.

The main armament was changed from the 130 mm used on the to the standard British destroyer calibre of 4.7 inch (120 mm). However, the guns were not British, but were instead Swedish Bofors 50cal QF M34/36, the same as those used previously on the minelayer .

===Original &quot;Grom&quot; class===
There were two ships built:
* - Sunk on 4 May 1940 in Ofotfjord near Narvik
* - Currently preserved as a museum ship in Gdynia

===Improved &quot;Grom&quot; class===

Two more ships of this class (&quot;Huragan&quot; and &quot;Orkan&quot;) were ordered in 1939 to be built in Gdynia, but war broke out soon after the first was laid down. They would have been the first major modern warships to be built in Poland.

==Operational service==

Just before the war broke out, the two destroyers were evacuated to Britain to fight alongside the Royal Navy. Since they were designed for Baltic operations, they had to be modified to improve stability to operate in the rough waters of the North Sea and the Atlantic. &quot;Grom&quot; was sunkin 1940 and in December 1941 &quot;Błyskawica&quot;, had its 4.7 inch guns replaced by eight 4-inch (102 mm) guns in twin mountings. Various other modifications of armaments and sensors were made during the war.

<doc id="631654" wikidata="Q1328914" url="?curid=631654" title="Reflecting pool">
<text>A reflecting pool, also called a reflection pool, is a water feature found in gardens, parks and memorial sites. It usually consists of a shallow pool of water with a reflective surface, undisturbed by fountain jets.

==Design==
Reflecting pools are often designed with the outer basin floor at the rim slightly deeper than the central area to suppress wave formation. They can be as small as a bird bath to as large as a major civic element. Their origins are from ancient Persian gardens.

==List of notable pools== 

* The Miroir d&#x27;eau (Water mirror) on Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux, France.
* The Mughal garden reflecting pools at the Taj Mahal in Agra, India
* Chehel Sotoun in Iran
* The Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool and Capitol Reflecting Pool, in Washington, D.C.
* Mary Gibbs and Jesse H. Jones Reflection Pool, Hermann Park, Houston, Texas, U.S.
* The modernist Palácio do Planalto and Palácio da Alvorada in Brasília, Brazil
* Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta, Georgia
* The Oklahoma City National Memorial, at the site of the Oklahoma City bombing
* The Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, where a former reflecting pool was located in front of the stage, – 1972
* The National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum, located at the World Trade Center site in New York City, with two reflecting pools on the location where the Twin Towers stood

<text>Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre (formerly known as Regina—Arm River) was a federal electoral district in Saskatchewan, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015.

==Geography==
The district included the northwestern part of the city of Regina and extended outward from Regina to Nokomis in the north, Davidson in the northwest and Tugaske in the west.

==History==
The electoral district was created as &quot;Regina—Arm River&quot; in 1996 from Regina—Lumsden and portions of Moose Jaw—Lake Centre, Mackenzie and Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle ridings.

In 1997, its name was changed to &quot;Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre&quot;.

The riding was dissolved in the 2012 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, redistributed between Regina—Lewvan, Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle, and Moose Jaw—Lake Centre—Lanigan.

<text>The Vaselines are a Scottish alternative rock band. Formed in Glasgow in 1986, the band was originally a duo between its songwriters Eugene Kelly and Frances McKee, but later added James Seenan and Eugene&#x27;s brother Charlie Kelly on bass and drums respectively from the band Secession. McKee had formerly been a member of a band named the Pretty Flowers with Duglas T. Stewart, Norman Blake, Janice McBride and Sean Dickson. Eugene Kelly had formerly played in the Famous Monsters.

== History ==
The band formed in 1986, initially as a duo backed by a drum machine. Originally intending to create a fanzine, Kelly and McKee decided to form a band instead. Stephen Pastel of the Pastels is credited with coming up with their name. After playing their first gigs, they signed to Pastel&#x27;s 53rd and 3rd label and recorded the &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; EP with him producing, released in summer 1987. The EP featured a cover of Divine&#x27;s &quot;You Think You&#x27;re a Man&quot; on its B-side. By late 1987, Eugene&#x27;s brother Charlie Kelly had joined on drums with James Seenan on bass. With this line-up and with Stephen Pastel producing again, they recorded the &quot;Dying for It&quot; EP, released in early 1988. It featured the songs &quot;Molly&#x27;s Lips&quot; and &quot;Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam,&quot; both of which American rock band Nirvana would later cover. In June 1989 they released their first album, &quot;Dum-Dum&quot;, again on 53rd and 3rd but distributed by Rough Trade. The band broke up shortly after its release due jointly to the dissolution of 53rd &amp; 3rd and the end of Kelly and McKee&#x27;s romantic relationship. They briefly reformed in October 1990 to open for Nirvana when they played in Edinburgh.

Kelly went on to found the band Captain America (later renamed Eugenius after legal threats from Marvel Comics), supporting Nirvana on their UK tour. Following solo performances Kelly released the album &quot;Man Alive&quot; in 2004. McKee founded the bands Painkillers in 1994 and Suckle in 1997 before releasing her first solo album, &quot;Sunny Moon&quot;, in 2006.

Though they were not widely known outside Scotland during their short career, their association with Nirvana brought exposure to the band. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain once described Kelly and McKee as his &quot;favorite songwriters in the whole world&quot;. With their songs &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Molly&#x27;s Lips&quot; covered on Nirvana&#x27;s album &quot;Incesticide&quot; and &quot;Jesus Doesn&#x27;t Want Me for a Sunbeam&quot; covered on &quot;MTV Unplugged in New York&quot;, the band gained a new audience. At the 1991 Reading Festival, Kelly joined Nirvana on stage for a performance of &quot;Molly&#x27;s Lips&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;ve never made any money apart from my Nirvana royalties,&quot; Kelly noted. &quot;It was my tiny bit of rock history, but a strange feeling because by then I was striving for recognition with other bands. I still haven&#x27;t come to terms with it, although it allowed me to go on playing, and get a mortgage without having a job.&quot;

In 1992, Sub Pop released &quot;The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History&quot;, a compilation that contained the Vaselines&#x27; entire body of work at the time.

The story of the Vaselines from 1986 to the early 1990s is covered in the 2017 documentary Teenage Superstars, in which both McKee and Kelly feature.

The Vaselines song Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam was played in 1993 by Nirvana in their MTV Unplugged in New York concert as a cover (renamed as “Jesus Doesn’t Want Me for a Sunbeam.”)

== Reformation ==
In the summer of 2006, McKee and Kelly took to the stage together for the first time since 1990 to perform a set of Vaselines songs, as part of a joint tour to promote their individual solo albums.

The Vaselines reformed (minus the old rhythm section) on 24 April 2008 for a charity show for the Malawi Orphan Support group at Glasgow&#x27;s MONO venue. Invitation was by word-of-mouth with no press announcements and the band played to a packed, enthusiastic audience.

The Vaselines performed on 16 May 2008 at Scotland&#x27;s Tigerfest. Members of Belle and Sebastian supported their live set. The band then played their first-ever U.S. performance at Maxwell&#x27;s in Hoboken, NJ on 9 July. The band also performed at Sub Pop Records&#x27; 20th Anniversary SP20 music festival on 12 July at Marymoor Park just outside Seattle WA.

On 27 March 2009, they played their first London date in 20 years at the London Forum.

On 5 May, Sub Pop released &quot;Enter the Vaselines&quot;. A deluxe-edition reissue of the 1992 Sub Pop release, it includes remastered versions of the band&#x27;s two EPs (&quot;Son of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Dying for It&quot;), and a remixed version of their sole album (&quot;Dum-Dum&quot;), as well as demos and live recordings from 1986 and 1988. The band toured the U.S. in May 2009, playing six dates, starting in Los Angeles on 10 May, then heading up the west coast to San Francisco, Portland and Seattle. Dates for Chicago, IL and Brooklyn, NY would end the tour on 18 May. The band finished their May tour at the Primavera Sound festival in Barcelona.

On 19 July 2009, the Vaselines played the Uncut Arena at the Latitude Festival in Suffolk.

On 9 October 2009, the Vaselines made a long-awaited return to Edinburgh to support Mudhoney at HMV Picture House.

The band were chosen personally by Belle and Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties in the UK in December 2010.

The band performed a cover version of the Nirvana song &quot;Lithium&quot; as part of a Spin Magazine&#x27;s exclusive album, &quot;Newermind&quot;. It is the Nirvana album &quot;Nevermind&quot;, performed by different artists.

The Vaselines second studio album, &quot;Sex With an X&quot;, was released in September 2010.

The Vaselines announced their third studio album, &quot;V for Vaselines&quot;, in June 2014 which was released on 29 September 2014 on Rosary Music. &quot;One Lost Year&quot; from the album was made available for free download from their SoundCloud page. The single &quot;High Tide Low Tide&quot; followed in August, being released as a digital download and 7-inch vinyl.
The band features in the book &quot;Postcards from Scotland&quot; detailing the 1980s and 1990s independent music scene in Scotland.

<text>Theodore Martin Hesburgh, CSC (May 25, 1917 – February 26, 2015) was an American Catholic priest and academic who was a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross. He was president of the University of Notre Dame for 35 years from 1952 to 1987.

In addition to his career as an educator and author, Hesburgh was a public servant and social activist involved in numerous American civic and government initiatives, commissions, international humanitarian projects, and papal assignments. Hesburgh received numerous honors and awards for his service, most notably the United States&#x27;s Presidential Medal of Freedom (1964) and Congressional Gold Medal (2000). As of 2013, he also held the world&#x27;s record for the individual with the most honorary degrees with more than 150.

Hesburgh is credited with bringing Notre Dame, long known for its football program, to the forefront of American Catholic universities and its transition to a nationally respected institution of higher education. He supervised the university&#x27;s dramatic growth, as well as the successful transfer of its ownership from Holy Cross priests to the Notre Dame board of trustees in 1967. During his tenure as president, the university also became a coeducational institution. 
In addition to his service to Notre Dame, Hesburgh held leadership positions in numerous groups involved in civil rights, peaceful uses of atomic energy, immigration reform, and Third World development. Hesburgh was also active on the boards of numerous businesses, nonprofits, civic organizations, and Vatican missions.

==Early life and education==
Hesburgh was born on May 25, 1917, in Syracuse, New York, to Theodore Bernard Hesburgh, a Pittsburgh Plate Glass warehouse manager, and Anne Murphy Hesburgh. His father was of Luxembourgish ancestry; his mother&#x27;s family was of Irish descent. Theodore was the second child and oldest son in a family of five children that included two boys and three girls. He attended Most Holy Rosary, a parochial school in Syracuse, and also served as an altar boy. Hesburgh claimed that he had wished to become a priest since the age of six. Thomas Duffy, a missionary priest from the Congregation of Holy Cross, which owned the University of Notre Dame, encouraged Hesburgh&#x27;s interest in joining the priesthood.

Hesburgh graduated from Most Holy Rosary High School in Syracuse in 1934 and enrolled in the Holy Cross Seminary at Notre Dame in the fall. In 1937, his teachers decided to send the promising young seminarian to study in Rome, Italy, where he graduated from the Pontifical Gregorian University with a bachelor of philosophy degree in 1940. When the American consul in Rome ordered all U.S. citizens to leave Italy in 1940, due to the outbreak of World War II, Hesburgh returned to the United States to continue his studies. He spent three years (1940–43) studying theology at the Holy Cross College in Washington, D.C., and two years (1943–45) studying at The Catholic University of America, where he earned a doctorate in sacred theology in 1945.

On June 24, 1943, Hesburgh was ordained a priest for the Congregation of Holy Cross at Notre Dame&#x27;s Sacred Heart Church (later renamed the Basilica of the Sacred Heart). Inspired by an inscription carved in stone above the church&#x27;s door, Hesburgh dedicated his life to &quot;God, Country, and Notre Dame.&quot; Afterwards, Father Ted, as he preferred to be called, returned to Washington, D.C., to complete his studies and assist at area parishes. In addition, Hesburgh served as a chaplain at the National Training School for Boys (a juvenile detention facility) and at a military installation. He also ran a large United Service Organization (USO) club in a Knights of Columbus hall in Washington, D.C. Although Hesburgh expressed an interest in serving as a chaplain in the U.S. Navy during World War II, he returned to Notre Dame, Indiana, in 1945, after completion of his studies in Washington, D.C., to begin a teaching career at the university.

==Career==
===Early years===
Hesburgh joined the Notre Dame faculty as an instructor in the university&#x27;s Department of Religion in 1945. In 1948 Hesburgh was named head of the Department of Theology, and in 1949 Notre Dame&#x27;s president, John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., appointed Hesburgh executive vice president. Three years later, 
at the age of thirty-five, Hesburgh succeeded Cavanaugh as president.

===President of Notre Dame===
Hesburgh served as Notre Dame&#x27;s president for thirty-five years, from 1952 until his retirement in 1987. At that time his was &quot;the longest presidency in American higher education.&quot; Hesburgh immediately began efforts to transform the school, primarily known for its football program, &quot;into a nationally respected institution of higher learning.&quot; In 1953 the university created the Distinguished Professors Program to attract top scholars to Notre Dame. By the time of Hesburgh&#x27;s retirement in 1987, the school had established more than a hundred distinguished professorships.
Hesburgh supervised dramatic growth at the university and expansion of its endowment, as well as its transition to a coeducational institution which occurred in 1972. During his presidency (1952–87), the annual operating budget increased from $9.7 million to $176.6 million and the university&#x27;s endowment increased from $9 million to $350 million. Research funding increased from $735,000 to $15 million. Student enrollment nearly doubled from 4,979 to 9,676, and its faculty more than doubled from 389 to 951. The average faculty salary rose from $5,400 to $50,800. The number of degrees conferred annually doubled from 1,212 to 2,663. While Hesburgh was president, the university also initiated forty new building projects, including the $8 million library with the famous &quot;Word of Life&quot; mural, better known as &quot;Touchdown Jesus,&quot; on its façade.

Hesburgh played a key role in developing the Land O&#x27;Lakes Statement that North American representatives of the International Federation of Catholic Universities issued in 1967. The document outlined a commitment to academic freedom with independent governance and insisted that &quot;a Catholic university properly developed can even more fully achieve the ideal of a true university.&quot; The statement created some controversy because it declared that Catholic universities should be autonomous, free from all authority, including the Catholic Church. Despite the conflicts that the statement initiated, Hesburg&#x27;s commitment to excellence &quot;transformed Notre Dame into one of the most recognizable and prestigious Catholic universities in the United States&quot;. In 1967, Hesburgh ended the university&#x27;s exclusive, century-long leadership by the Congregation of Holy Cross clergy. Hesburgh and Howard Kenna worked together to establish a plan for transferring ownership of the university from the Congregation of Holy Cross priests to the University of Notre Dame Board of Trustees. The new governing board included laypersons and Holy Cross priests as trustees and fellows.

During the 1960s, when student demonstrations were held at colleges and universities across the United States, Hesburgh and many other collegiate presidents came under attack. For Notre Dame the climax of student unrest occurred in 1968–69. On February 17, 1969, Hesburgh took a controversial position in dealing with anti-Vietnam War student activism on campus when he issued an eight-page letter to the student body outlining the university&#x27;s stance on protests. Hesburgh&#x27;s letter stated that student protesters who violated the rights of others or disrupted the school&#x27;s operations would be given fifteen minutes to cease and desist before facing suspension, or expulsion if they refused to disperse. Hesburgh&#x27;s action provoked controversy and made national headlines. The letter was reprinted in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, and the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. Although Hesburgh received harsh criticism from Notre Dame&#x27;s students, including requests for his resignation, responses to editorials in 250 newspapers about his &quot;fifteen-minute rule&quot; were nearly all favorable. In addition, President Richard Nixon sent Hesburgh a telegram praising his &quot;tough stance&quot; on the campus&#x27;s student protests.

At President Nixon&#x27;s request, Hesburgh offered advice to Vice President Spiro Agnew in a letter written on February 27, 1969, that included suggestions for potential actions that could be taken to control the violence on college campuses. Hesburgh, who generally disagreed with the Nixon administration&#x27;s policy in Vietnam and favored an accelerated withdrawal of the troops, advised against repressive legislation to control campus protests. Hesburgh argued that university and college administrations should be allowed to continue to decide the appropriate action to take on their respective campuses. The National Governors Conference agreed with his view; the majority of state governors opposed the proposed legislation. In October 1969, Hesburgh publicly expressed his opposition to the war by signing a letter with other college presidents calling for withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam and was present at an on-campus peace Mass with 2,500 Notre Dame students the following day.

Hesburgh, a member and later chair of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, was publicly vocal in his support for equal rights, but he did not immediately recognize or take significant action to eliminate institutional racism at Notre Dame, where the number of black students and employees &quot;remained at token levels until the late 1960s.&quot; In 1969, after some of Notre Dame&#x27;s African American student activists criticized the low level of blacks enrolled at the university, Hesburgh appointed a student-faculty committee to assess the issue. The committee&#x27;s findings caused him to take immediate measures to increase minority employment and aggressively recruit minority students. Hesburgh also persuaded the university&#x27;s trustees to lift their forty-year ban on participation in postseason football games and used revenue generated from Notre Dame&#x27;s bowl game appearances to fund minority scholarships. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish&#x27;s win over the University of Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic in 1970 raised $300,000 for Notre Dame&#x27;s scholarship fund.

Notre Dame, as with other colleges and universities around the country, continued to experience antiwar protests as the Vietnam War proceeded to escalate. In early May 1970, after learning of rumors that a group of students and antiwar activists planned to firebomb the Notre Dame campus&#x27;s Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC) building, Hesburgh responded with a public statement on May 4. In an address to a crowd of approximately 2,000 students, Hesburgh spoke against the war and objected to Nixon&#x27;s decision to send troops into Cambodia. During his conciliatory remarks, Hesburgh also outlined steps that he thought the government could take to address student concerns. On May 18, Hesburgh sent a letter to President Nixon and a copy of his address, which became known as the Hesburgh Declaration. Although campus unrest caused classes to be canceled on May 6, Notre Dame&#x27;s seven days of protest ended without damage, violence, or National Guard presence as it did on other college campuses, such as Columbia University, the University of California, Berkeley, and elsewhere.

By the early 1970s, Hesburgh had become the most well-known American Catholic in the United States. He continued to respond to student concerns during the 1970s and 1980s. To increase student involvement in the administration&#x27;s decision-making process, Hesburgh added student representatives to university committees.

===Civic and U.S. government activist===
Hesburgh&#x27;s career included many civic activities, as well as American and international initiatives beyond his work at Notre Dame. Hesburgh estimated he spent about 40 percent of his time off-campus and believed that his civic involvement &quot;enriched&quot; his priesthood.

Beginning in 1955, Hesburgh served in a number of posts on government commissions that included National Science Board and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, and also served on the boards of non-profit organizations, such as the Rockefeller Foundation, and Vatican missions. His career included at least sixteen presidential appointments involving some of the major social issues of his era: civil rights, campus unrest, Third World development, peaceful uses of atomic energy, and immigration reform, &quot;including the American policy of amnesty for immigrants in the mid-1980s.&quot;

Hesburgh&#x27;s first presidential appointment occurred in 1954, when President Dwight Eisenhower appointed him to the National Science Board. Although Hesburgh had no previous experience as an activist supporting civil rights issues, President Eisenhower made him a member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission in 1957, beginning fifteen years of service on the commission. Hesburgh emerged as a civil rights advocate and spokesperson for the commission. In an appendix to the commission&#x27;s annual report in 1959, Hesburgh outlined his position on civil rights and equality: 

In 1961 Hesburgh persuaded the Indiana Conference of Higher Education to support a Notre Dame-based pilot project for President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s new Peace Corps initiative that trained new volunteers for service in Chile, but he felt that the Kennedy administration had a poor record on civil rights issues. In contrast to his assessment of the Kennedy administration&#x27;s civil rights efforts, Hesburgh praised Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s work to secure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the U.S. Congress and his courage for supporting the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Hesburgh also made public appearances to show his support for the civil rights movement. On July 21, 1964, Hesburgh delivered an impromptu speech during Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s civil rights rally in Chicago, Illinois. At the conclusion of the event, he joined hands with King and other civil rights supporters as the group sang &quot;We Shall Overcome.&quot;

Hesburgh served as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission from 1969, when President Nixon appointed him to the leadership position, until 1972, when White House aides asked for Hesburgh&#x27;s resignation. His dismissal from the commission in 1972 followed a series of disagreements between Hesburgh, the commission, and the Nixon administration about civil rights policies. Hesburgh objected to the president&#x27;s slowdown policy on school desegregation, opposed Nixon&#x27;s anti-busing policy, and advocated for the renewal of the Voting Rights Act, which the Nixon administration wanted to amend. Hesburgh publicly explained that he believed the primary reason for his dismissal was due to the commission&#x27;s report on minority employment in government.

According to Rick Perlstein in (2008), when Thomas Eagleton dropped out of the race as George McGovern&#x27;s vice presidential running mate in the 1972 presidential election, Hesburgh was among many people considered as a replacement candidate for Eagleton, but he declined the offer. In the 1970s, Hesburgh made public his approval for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. During that decade, the organization Catholics Act for ERA sent out marketing materials on behalf of the amendment quoting support from Hesburgh.

President Jimmy Carter appointed Hesburgh to a blue-ribbon immigration reform commission in 1979; the commission&#x27;s finding that any national immigration reform proposals can succeed only if the American national border is properly secured beforehand was cited by various opponents of illegal immigration to the United States. His efforts on the commission led to the passing of the Refugee Act of 1980, and the creation of a professional Asylum Corps in the 1990s.

===Papal appointments===
Hesburgh served as a permanent Holy See representative from 1956 to 1970 to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria. Pope Paul VI appointed Hesburgh as head of the Vatican representatives attending the twentieth anniversary of the United Nations&#x27; human rights declaration in Tehran, Iran, and as a member of the Holy See&#x27;s U.N. delegation in 1974. Pope John Paul II appointed Hesburgh to the Pontifical Council for Culture in 1983.

===Business and nonprofit foundation leader===
Throughout his career, Hesburgh was active on many advisory boards related to higher education, science, business, and civic affairs. He also traveled the world on behalf of the university and the organizations he served.

In the field of higher education, Hesburgh was a contributor to &quot;The Pursuit of Excellence&quot; (1958), an analysis of the U.S. education system that the Rockefeller Brothers Fund commissioned as part of its Special Studies Project. Hesburgh also served as a member of the International Federation of Catholic Universities, and as its president from 1963 to 1970; a board member and eventual president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities; a board member of the American Council on Education; and a board member of the Institute of International Education, among other education-related groups.

In 1990, during his retirement years, Hesburgh became the first priest to be elected to the Harvard Board of Overseers (board of directors), and served from 1994 to 1996 as the board&#x27;s president. Hesburgh also served as co-chairman of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics that made significant revisions to the regulation of American collegiate sports.

Hesburgh was involved with several science-related projects and organizations. From 1956 until 1970, he served as the permanent Vatican representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, Austria. In addition to serving on the U.S. National Science Board, Hesburgh was appointed U.S. ambassador to the 1979 United Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development. He also served with the Midwestern Universities Research Association and the Nutrition Foundation Board. While serving on the board of the United States Institute of Peace, Hesburgh &quot;helped organize a meeting of scientists and representative leaders of six faith traditions who called for the elimination of nuclear weapons.&quot;

Hesburgh was a board member of numerous business and civic organizations. From 1961 to 1982 he served on the board of the Rockefeller Foundation, and from 1977 to 1982 as board chairman. Hesburgh also served as a director for the Chase Manhattan Bank and was one of the four main founders of People for the American Way, which was among many other organizations he served with. Hesburgh&#x27;s interest in international affairs also led to his service on numerous international commissions and humanitarian projects.

==Later years==

After his retirement as president of the University of Notre Dame in 1987, Hesburgh took a year off for travel and vacation. Upon his return, he came to campus to work each day at his new office on the thirteenth floor of the library that eventually bore his name, and wrote his autobiography, &quot;God, Country, Notre Dame: The Autobiography of Theodore M. Hesburgh&quot; (1990) with Jerry Reedy. The book spent six weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; best-seller list. At the conclusion of the book, Hesburgh remarked:

Hesburgh kept busy in his retirement years, which also included time to relax at the Holy Cross property at Land O&#x27; Lakes, Wisconsin. He wrote regularly, including a second book, &quot;Travels with Ted and Ned&quot; (1992), which received mixed reviews, and edited &quot;The Challenge and Promise of a Catholic University&quot; (1994), a collection of essays on Catholic higher education. Hesburgh continued to deliver speeches and lectures, as well as serving on numerous boards and committees, including his controversial decision in 1994 to co-chair the legal defense fund for President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton with former U.S. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach.

Hesburgh was especially active in the development of five institutions he organized: the Ecumenical Institute for Theology Studies at Tantur, Jerusalem; Notre Dame&#x27;s Center for Civil and Human Rights; the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies; the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies; and the Hank Family Environmental Research Center. Other retirement activities included co-chairing the Knight Commission with William C. &quot;Bill&quot; Friday, former president of the University of North Carolina, and joining the Harvard Board of Overseers in 1990. In 2009, he supported the invitation to Barack Obama to speak at Notre Dame, which was controversial because of Obama&#x27;s strong endorsement of pro-choice legislation.

==Death and legacy==

Hesburgh died on February 26, 2015, at the age of 97. His death, funeral, and memorial service gained widespread media attention. Attendees and speakers at the memorial service included former President Jimmy Carter, Condoleezza Rice, Lou Holtz, then cardinal Theodore McCarrick and cardinal Roger Mahony, former U.S. senator Harris L. Wofford, Indiana governor Mike Pence, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, former U.S. senator Alan K. Simpson, U.S. senator Joe Donnelly, William G. Bowen, and a video message from President Barack Obama.

Father Hesburgh was the president of the University of Notre Dame from 1952 to 1987. He was an American Catholic priest and educator who achieved national prominence through his public service work. He increased the stature and size of the university, liberalized the rules regulating student life, promoted academic freedom, and worked toward making Notre Dame one of the top universities in the country, doubling its enrollment and greatly increasing its endowment. He transferred its governance from the Congregation of Holy Cross to a mixed lay and religious board and oversaw the admittance of women students in 1972. He was also the chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and of the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy. He received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1964) and a Congressional Gold Medal (1999), and more than 150 honorary degrees. He was a steadfast champion for human rights, the cause of peace, and care for the poor.

Hesburgh&#x27;s leadership as president of the University of Notre Dame brought it to the forefront of American Catholic universities. A &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story from February 9, 1962, named him as &quot;the most influential figure in the reshaping of Catholic higher education in the U.S.&quot; Long known for its football program, Notre Dame also became known for its academics. While Hesburgh was slow to recognize that Notre Dame&#x27;s &quot;policies and practices unintentionally produced unequal outcomes,&quot; he took decisive action after its minority students challenged him to do so. By the 1970s Notre Dame was a &quot;much more diverse university than it had been ten years earlier.&quot;

The university has named several buildings, scholarships, and academic programs in his honor, including the Hesburgh Library, the Hesburgh Institute for International Studies, which Hesburgh founded in 1985, the Hesburgh-Yusko Scholarship, and the Hesburgh International Scholar Experience. Hesburgh&#x27;s papers are housed in the Archives of the University of Notre Dame. Notre Dame&#x27;s Hesburgh Library initially opened as the Memorial Library on September 18, 1963, and was renamed in his honor in 1987. In his retirement, Hesburgh maintained a private office on the library&#x27;s thirteenth floor.

Hesburgh, one of the country&#x27;s &quot;most respected clergyman,&quot; was a strong supporter of interfaith dialogue. He also brought a Catholic perspective to the numerous government commissions, civic initiatives, and other projects in which he was involved. From his position within the American political establishment and as a major figure in the Catholic Church from the 1950s to the 1990s, he used his influence to urge support of political policies and legislation to help solve national problems.

Hesburgh remained an activist for most of his adult life, especially in the area of civil rights and equality. He played a significant role in national affairs, beginning in the mid-twentieth century, and became well known for his liberal point of view, which was based on concepts of freedom and autonomy. Hesburgh supported the peaceful use of atomic energy, aid to developing Third World countries (especially Africa and Latin America), and civil rights and equality. Although his remarks and actions were controversial at times, &quot;he nearly always came through unscathed.&quot;

As a fifteen-year member of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, Hesburgh took a public stand against racism and prejudice. He used his skills as a leader to forge strong alliances, even with those who held different political philosophies. For Hesburgh, civil rights were a moral issue, as he once declared: While Hesburgh was criticized by some for his social and political ideas, many praised his &quot;contributions to ecumenism, civil rights, and world peace&quot;

In 2018, &quot;Hesburgh&quot;, a documentary film directed by Patrick Creadon, was released. It covers Hesburgh&#x27;s life, particularly his presidency at Notre Dame and his work in civil rights.

<text>The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) is an informal international group of systematic botanists who collaborate to establish a consensus on the taxonomy of flowering plants (angiosperms) that reflects new knowledge about plant relationships discovered through phylogenetic studies.

, four incremental versions of a classification system have resulted from this collaboration, published in 1998, 2003, 2009 and 2016. An important motivation for the group was what they considered deficiencies in prior angiosperm classifications since they were not based on monophyletic groups (i.e., groups that include all the descendants of a common ancestor).

APG publications are increasingly influential, with a number of major herbaria changing the arrangement of their collections to match the latest APG system.

==Angiosperm classification and the APG==
In the past, classification systems were typically produced by an individual botanist or by a small group. The result was a large number of systems (see List of systems of plant taxonomy). Different systems and their updates were generally favoured in different countries. Examples are the Engler system in continental Europe, the Bentham &amp; Hooker system in Britain (particularly influential because it was used by Kew), the Takhtajan system in the former Soviet Union and countries within its sphere of influence and the Cronquist system in the United States.

Before the availability of genetic evidence, the classification of angiosperms (also known as &quot;flowering plants&quot;, &quot;Angiospermae&quot;, &quot;Anthophyta&quot; or &quot;Magnoliophyta&quot;) was based on their morphology (particularly of their flower) and biochemistry (the kinds of chemical compounds in the plant).

After the 1980s, detailed genetic evidence analysed by phylogenetic methods became available and while confirming or clarifying some relationships in existing classification systems, it radically changed others. This genetic evidence created a rapid increase in knowledge that led to many proposed changes; stability was &quot;rudely shattered&quot;. This posed problems for all users of classification systems (including encyclopaedists). The impetus came from a major molecular study published in 1993 based on 5000 flowering plants and a photosynthesis gene (rbcL). This produced a number of surprising results in terms of the relationships between groupings of plants, for instance the dicotyledons were not supported as a distinct group. At first there was a reluctance to develop a new system based entirely on a single gene. However, subsequent work continued to support these findings. These research studies involved an unprecedented collaboration between a very large number of scientists. Therefore, rather than naming all the individual contributors a decision was made to adopt the name Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification, or APG for short. The first publication under this name was in 1998, and attracted considerable media attention. The intention was to provide a widely accepted and more stable point of reference for angiosperm classification.

, three revisions have been published, in 2003 (APG II), in 2009 (APG III) and in 2016 (APG IV), each superseding the previous system. Thirteen researchers have been listed as authors to the three papers, and a further 43 as contributors (see Members of the APG below).
A classification presents a view at a particular point in time, based on a particular state of research. Independent researchers, including members of the APG, continue to publish their own views on areas of angiosperm taxonomy. Classifications change, however inconvenient this is to users. However, the APG publications are increasingly regarded as an authoritative point of reference and the following are some examples of the influence of the APG system:
* A significant number of major herbaria, including Kew, are changing the order of their collections in accordance with APG.
* The influential World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (also from Kew) is being updated to the APG III system.
* In the United States in 2006, a photographic survey of the plants of the US and Canada is organized according to the APG II system.
* In the UK, the 2010 edition of the standard flora of the British Isles (by Stace) is based on the APG III system. The previous editions were based on the Cronquist system.

==Principles of the APG system==

The principles of the APG&#x27;s approach to classification were set out in the first paper of 1998, and have remained unchanged in subsequent revisions. Briefly, these are:
* The Linnean system of orders and families should be retained. &quot;The family is central in flowering plant systematics.&quot; An ordinal classification of families is proposed as a &quot;reference tool of broad utility&quot;. Orders are considered to be of particular value in teaching and in studying family relationships.
* Groups should be monophyletic (i.e. consist of &quot;all&quot; descendants of a common ancestor). The main reason why existing systems are rejected is because they do not have this property, they are not phylogenetic.
* A broad approach is taken to defining the limits of groups such as orders and families. Thus of orders, it is said that a limited number of larger orders will be more useful. Families containing only a single genus and orders containing only a single family are avoided where this is possible without violating the over-riding requirement for monophyly.
* Above or parallel to the level of orders and families, the term clades is used more freely. (Some clades have later been given formal names in a paper associated with the 2009 revision of the APG system.) The authors say that it is &quot;not possible, nor is it desirable&quot; to name all clades in a phylogenetic tree; however, systematists need to agree on names for some clades, particularly orders and families, to facilitate communication and discussion.

For a detailed discussion on phylogenetic nomenclature, see Cantino &quot;et al.&quot; (2007).)

==APG I (1998)==

The initial 1998 paper by the APG made angiosperms the first large group of organisms to be systematically re-classified primarily on the basis of genetic characteristics. The paper explained the authors&#x27; view that there is a need for a classification system for angiosperms at the level of families, orders and above, but that existing classifications were &quot;outdated&quot;. The main reason why existing systems were rejected was because they were not phylogenetic, i.e. not based on strictly monophyletic groups (groups which consist of &quot;all&quot; descendants of a common ancestor). An ordinal classification of flowering plant families was proposed as a &quot;reference tool of broad utility&quot;. The broad approach adopted to defining the limits of orders resulted in the recognition of 40 orders, compared to, for example, 232 in Takhtajan&#x27;s 1997 classification.

In 1998 only a handful of families had been adequately studied, but the primary aim was to obtain a consensus on the naming of higher orders. Such a consensus proved relatively easy to achieve but the resultant tree was highly unresolved. That is, while the relationship of orders was established, their composition was not.

Other features of the proposed classification included:
* Formal, scientific names are not used above the level of order, named clades being used instead. Thus eudicots and monocots are not given a formal rank on the grounds that &quot;it is not yet clear at which level they should be recognized&quot;.
* A substantial number of taxa whose classification had traditionally been uncertain are given places, although there still remain 25 families of &quot;uncertain position&quot;.
* Alternative classifications are provided for some groups, in which a number of families can either be regarded as separate or can be merged into a single larger family. For example, the Fumariaceae can either be treated as a separate family or as part of Papaveraceae.

A major outcome of the classification was the disappearance of the traditional division of the flowering plants into two groups, monocots and dicots. The monocots were recognized as a clade, but the dicots were not, with a number of former dicots being placed in separate groups basal to both monocots and the remaining dicots, the eudicots or &#x27;true dicots&#x27;. The overall scheme was relatively simple. This consisted of a grade consisting of isolated taxa (referred to as ANITA), followed by the major angiosperm radiation, clades of monocots, magnolids and eudicots. The last being a large clade with smaller subclades and two main groupings, rosids and asterids, each in turn having two major subclades.

==APG II (2003)==

As the overall relationship between groups of flowering plants became clearer, the focus shifted to the family level, in particular those families generally accepted as problematic. Again, consensus was achieved relatively easily resulting in an updated classification at the family level. The second paper published by the APG in 2003 presented an update to the original classification of 1998. The authors stated that changes were proposed only when there was &quot;substantial new evidence&quot; which supported them.

The classification continued the tradition of seeking broad circumscriptions of taxa, for example trying to place small families containing only one genus in a larger group. The authors stated that they have generally accepted the views of specialists, although noting that specialists &quot;nearly always favour splitting of groups&quot; regarded as too varied in their morphology.

APG II continued and indeed extends the use of alternative &#x27;bracketed&#x27; taxa allowing the choice of either a large family or a number of smaller ones. For example, the large family Asparagaceae includes seven &#x27;bracketed&#x27; families which can either be considered as part of the Asparagaceae or as separate families.
Some of the main changes in APG II were:
* New orders are proposed, particularly to accommodate the &#x27;basal clades&#x27; left as families in the first system.
* Many of the previously unplaced families are now located within the system.
* Several major families are re-structured.

In 2007, a paper was published giving a linear ordering of the families in APG II, suitable for ordering herbarium specimens, for example.

==APG III (2009)==

The third paper from the APG updates the system described in the 2003 paper. The broad outline of the system remains unchanged, but the number of previously unplaced families and genera is significantly reduced. This requires the recognition of both new orders and new families compared to the previous classification. The number of orders goes up from 45 to 59; only 10 families are not placed in an order and only two of these (Apodanthaceae and Cynomoriaceae) are left entirely outside the classification. The authors say that they have tried to leave long-recognized families unchanged, while merging families with few genera. They &quot;hope the classification [...] will not need much further change.&quot;

A major change is that the paper discontinues the use of &#x27;bracketed&#x27; families in favour of larger, more inclusive families. As a result, the APG III system contains only 415 families, rather than the 457 of APG II. For example, the agave family (Agavaceae) and the hyacinth family (Hyacinthaceae) are no longer regarded as distinct from the broader asparagus family (Asparagaceae). The authors say that alternative circumscriptions, as in APG I and II, are likely to cause confusion and that major herbaria which are re-arranging their collections in accordance with the APG approach have all agreed to use the more inclusive families. This approach is being increasingly used in collections in herbaria and botanic gardens.

In the same volume of the journal, two related papers were published. One gives a linear ordering of the families in APG III; as with the linear ordering published for APG II, this is intended for ordering herbarium specimens, for example. The other paper gives, for the first time, a classification of the families in APG III which uses formal taxonomic ranks; previously only informal clade names were used above the ordinal level.

==APG IV (2016)==

In the development of a fourth version there was some controversy over the methodology, and the development of a consensus proved more difficult than in previous iterations. In particular Peter Stevens questioned the validity of discussions regarding family delimitation in the absence of changes of phylogenetic relationships.

Further progress was made by the use of large banks of genes, including those of plastid, mitochondrial and nuclear ribosomal origin, such as that of Douglas Soltis and colleagues (2011). The fourth version was finally published in 2016. It arose from an international conference hosted at the Royal Botanical Gardens in September 2015 and also an online survey of botanists and other users. The broad outline of the system remains unchanged but several new orders are included (Boraginales, Dilleniales, Icacinales, Metteniusales and Vahliales), some new families are recognised (Kewaceae, Macarthuriaceae, Maundiaceae, Mazaceae, Microteaceae, Nyssaceae, Peraceae, Petenaeaceae and Petiveriaceae) and some previously recognised families are lumped (Aristolochiaceae now includes Lactoridaceae and Hydnoraceae; Restionaceae now re-includes Anarthriaceae and Centrolepidaceae; and Buxaceae now includes Haptanthaceae). Due to nomenclatural issues, the family name Asphodelaceae is used instead of Xanthorrhoeaceae, and Francoaceae is used instead of Melianthaceae (and now also includes Vivianiaceae). This brings the total number of orders and families recognized in the APG system to 64 and 416, respectively. Two additional informal major clades, superrosids and superasterids, that each comprise the additional orders that are included in the larger clades dominated by the rosids and asterids are also included. APG IV also uses the linear approach (LAPG) as advocated by Haston &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) In a supplemental file Byng &quot;et al.&quot; provide an alphabetical list of families by orders.

== Updates ==

Peter Stevens, one of the authors of all four of the APG papers, maintains a web site, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website (APWeb), hosted by the Missouri Botanical Garden, which has been regularly updated since 2001, and is a useful source for the latest research in angiosperm phylogeny which follows the APG approach. Other sources include the Angiosperm Phylogeny Poster and The Flowering Plants Handbook.

<text>The Congregation of Holy Cross (), abbreviated CSC, is a Catholic clerical religious congregation of pontifical right for men founded in 1837 by Basil Moreau, in Le Mans, France.

Moreau also founded the Marianites of Holy Cross for women, now divided into three independent congregations of sisters: the Marianites of Holy Cross (Le Mans, France), the Sisters of the Holy Cross (Notre Dame, Indiana), and the Sisters of Holy Cross (Montreal, Quebec, Canada).

==History==

===Two Societies===
Basile Antoine-Marie Moreau was born at Laigné-en-Belin, near Le Mans, France, on February 11, 1799, in the final months of the French Revolution. When Moreau decided to enter the priesthood, he was forced to undergo his seminary training in secret for fear that the French government would arrest him. He completed his studies and was ordained for the Diocese of Le Mans in 1821. The French government continued to work for the removal of the Church from the educational system, which left many Catholics without a place to be educated or catechized. In 1835, Moreau had formed a group, which he called &quot;Auxiliary Priests&quot;, to serve the educational and evangelization needs of the Diocese of Le Mans.

On July 15, 1820, a priest of the Diocese of Le Mans, Jacques-Francois Dujarié, brought together a group of zealous men to serve the educational needs of the people in the French countryside. Fr. Dujarié named this group the Brothers of St. Joseph. By 1835 this group was well established in the diocese, but Dujarié was getting older and they were in need of a new leader. Dujarié and Moreau had met previously and discussed their views on the future of the Church in France and so Dujarié knew that Moreau was just the man he was looking for. With the consent of the bishop, Moreau was given control of the Brothers of St. Joseph on August 31, 1835. He was now the head of two organizations, the Auxiliary Priests and the Brothers of St. Joseph.

===The Association of Holy Cross===
In 1837, Moreau made the decision to combine his two communities into one society so that the priests and brothers could share resources and ministries in common. On March 1, 1837, the priests and brothers gathered in the church of Notre-Dame de Sainte-Croix, Le Mans, in the Sainte-Croix district of Le Mans to sign the Fundamental Act of Union which legally joined them into one association. This new group took on the name of where they met and became the Association of Holy Cross. Initially Holy Cross was a diocesan group and so they primarily served in whatever capacity the bishop asked of them. In 1840 this changed when Moreau received a request to send a delegation from his society to Algeria with the purpose of establishing schools and a seminary. It was at this point that Moreau shifted the focus of Holy Cross and after the first missionaries left in April 1840 the association took on the identity of a religious institute. On August 15, 1840, Moreau and four others became the first professed religious in the Association of Holy Cross. As part of his plan to form this religious institute, Moreau also brought together the first group of women who would become the Marianites of Holy Cross.

In 1841, he sent a group to the United States, establishing the first Holy Cross institution in North America at Notre Dame in Indiana. The institute expanded further by establishing missions in Canada in 1847 and in East Bengal in 1852.

This association of priests, brothers, and sisters, would continue in roughly the same form until May 13, 1857, when Pope Pius IX approved the first constitutions of the priests and brothers. From that point on the Association officially became the Congregation of Holy Cross. Doubting the propriety of a mixed congregation of men and women, Rome separated the women into an independent community at that time. Moreau, in his role as their founder, continued to work for Rome&#x27;s approval of the sisters&#x27; constitution. In 1865, Rome approved the constitutions of the Marianites of Holy Cross, granting them the status of an Apostolic congregation.

==Holy Cross and The Holy Family==
Moreau saw a visible image of the Holy Family in this Congregation of Holy Cross which he had conceived as an association of religious men and women working together on equal footing for the building of the reign of God. He intended that this Congregation, composed at its origins of three distinct Societies, namely, Sisters, Priests, and Brothers, be an apostolic institute. Calling on the spiritual aid of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, Moreau gave to each of the three groups a patron: he consecrated the priests to the Sacred Heart of Jesus; he consecrated the brothers to the pure heart of St. Joseph; and he consecrated the sisters to the Immaculate Heart of Mary. He also established Mary, under her title of Our Lady of Sorrows, as special patroness for all of Holy Cross, whose members in their several congregations continue to cherish these devotions. As Moreau stated in one of his letters, he envisioned that: &quot;Holy Cross will grow like a mighty tree and constantly shoot forth new limbs and new branches which will be nourished by the same sap and endowed with the same life.&quot;

==Foreign Missions==

===The Mission of Holy Cross in Bangladesh===
The first group of Holy Cross missionaries to reach India left England January 17, 1853. It was composed of three brothers, three sisters, one priest and one seminarian. (Two priests dropped out due to severe illness when the first attempt to sail in November 1852 failed due to storms.) The group arrived in Calcutta in May 1853. Fr. Verite took the sisters to Dhaka, while the brothers and seminarian went to Noakhali. Fr. Verite soon joined them as pastor of Noakhali, which included Agartala and Sylhet in its territory. Chittagong became the headquarters of Holy Cross in December 1853.

The East Bengal mission was called at the time, &quot;unquestionably the most destitute in East Asia and perhaps in any other part of the world.&quot; Because it was such a difficult and dangerous place to live and work, no other religious congregation showed any interest in it. Though the mission was named East Bengal, the Church jurisdiction and the political territory or civil jurisdiction called East Bengal were quite different from each other. The Province of East Bengal was first created in 1905. The Church territory was officially called the Vicariate of East Bengal, set up in 1845 by the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith at the Vatican. Its first superior was Bishop Thomas Olliffe, an Irish Jesuit. The Vicariate of East Bengal embraced the present-day Archdiocese of Dhaka, Diocese of Mymensingh, and Diocese of Chittagong, as well as a large part of Assam, the Arakan district (former name of the Rakhine State of western Burma, and the Diocese of Agartala in eastern India. It was a huge area, but when Holy Cross arrived in 1853, there were only three priests working there - a Portuguese Augustinian and two young Irish diocesan priests, both of whom were dead of disease by 1854. There were about 13,000 Catholics in the area. In Dhaka, there was no church or chapel at all under the jurisdiction of Rome.

===The Mission of Holy Cross in Chile===
The District of Chile is the longest-running mission still overseen by the United States Province. Three Holy Cross religious arrived in Santiago, Chile, on March 1, 1943, at the invitation of Cardinal José María Caro, Archbishop of Santiago (Chile), to administer Saint George&#x27;s College. Fathers William Havey, Alfred Send, and Joseph Dougherty believed they were going to do university work. Little did they know that &quot;college&quot; in this context meant a school of first through 12th graders.

Today, Saint George&#x27;s College serves 2,650 students. Its history is rich and is closely tied with the history of Chile, including the 1970s when the school was taken over by the military government and Holy Cross was ousted. The Congregation returned to the school in 1986. Strong faith formation and service have been a hallmark of Saint George&#x27;s. Over the decades, the college has formed many influential leaders in Chilean society. Also Holy Cross&#x27; first Chilean vocation, Fr. Jorge Canepa, was a 1946 graduate of the school.

Additionally, the District administers Colegio Nuestra Señora de Andacollo, located in the older sector of Central Santiago. The Congregation took responsibility for the school in the 1970s, after its expulsion from Saint George&#x27;s. The student body, numbering 1,100, is made up primarily of children from working-class families. With improvements to the physical plant and the strong Holy Cross commitment, the school has been able to reach new heights academically.

From the beginning, the mission of Holy Cross in Chile also included parish ministry and social service. Within three years of arriving, the Congregation had begun both its ministry at San Roque, a parish in the sector of Penalolen in Santiago, as well as its outreach to abandoned children in Santiago and later in Talagante. Today, the District administers two parishes in addition to San Roque: Nuestra Señora de Andacollo, in the same area as the school; and Nuestra Señora de la Merced, in Calle Larga, in the Diocese of San Felipe. The parishes are known for their youth ministry and social justice work. Then through Fundamor and Fundación Moreau, the District continues its work with abandoned children. Currently there are approximately 50 children in residence, ages 4 to 18. There is also a new prevention program ministering to 100 children that has been recognized as the first of its kind in Chile.

===The Mission of Holy Cross in Mexico===
Initially the members of the Congregation of Holy Cross were sent to Mexico from Texas.
In 1972, Fr. Frederick Schmidt, CSC, was sent to Mexico for a &quot;sabbatical&quot; by Fr. Christopher O&#x27;Toole, CSC, the Provincial of the Southern Province at the time. In 1973 Fr. Fred assumed the pastoral responsibility for a large parish in Ahuacatlan, San Luis Potosí, Nuestro Padre Jesús. He served as pastor for 25 years. In 1998 when Fr. Francisco Garcia, a priest from the Diocese of Ciudad Valles, was appointed pastor, Fr. Fred became the pastor emeritus. When Fr. Schmidt died in 2003, he was buried at the parish in the crypt of the convent church that he helped build. With his death, Holy Cross withdrew from this parish, although one of its members has become a Holy Cross priest. The relationship with the parish and pastor continues to be one of friendship and Holy Cross offers occasional assistance.

In 1987, the Southern Province assumed the responsibility for the pastoral care of Santo Tomas Moro parish in the Archdiocese of Monterrey, Nuevo León. The parish grew dramatically and eventually gave birth to a new parish, Nuestra Madre Santisima de La Luz. Holy Cross opted to shift from Santo Tomas Moro to this new parish with greater needs. Holy Cross continues to serve this community.

In 1993 the Southern Province founded a program of vocation promotion and initial formation for young Mexican men who believe they are called to religious life and priesthood in Holy Cross. The Southern Province established a program for postulants and a program for professed seminarians. The novitiate for the formation program is in Peru.

In 1999, Holy Cross Family Ministries founded Family Rosary in México. Their offices and meeting rooms are located in an Archdiocesan pastoral center in San Francisco Javier parish, close to La Luz parish in the Archdiocese of Monterrey. Their offices serve as a &quot;hub&quot; for the growing Holy Cross apostolate of fostering family prayer, especially the rosary, as well as devotion to Mary throughout Mexico.

In 2000, the local Holy Cross community in Monterrey established an immersion program at La Luz parish. This program provides an intercultural experience of life and ministry with and for the poor. It is offered principally to students from Holy Cross universities, high schools, and parishes in the United States. One group of Chilean laywomen also participated. The program has been temporarily suspended due to the wave of violence in Mexico.

In 2010, Fr. Marín Hernández, CSC, and Fr. Paulino Antonio, CSC, the first two Mexicans to be ordained as Holy Cross priests, were assigned to Parroquia San José in Tamán, San Luis Potosí. The Bishop of the Diocese of Ciudad Valles offered this parish to Holy Cross in part because of the indigenous community&#x27;s need for pastoral care and evangelization. Frs. Hernández and Antonio speak Nahuatl, the language of the people, and Fr. Antonio comes from this indigenous group.

In 2011 the Holy Cross community in Mexico became a part of the newly formed U.S. Province of Priests and Brothers.

The mission of Holy Cross in Peru began with an exhortation of Pope John XXIII to religious orders to send missionaries to Latin America, and Holy Cross arrived in the north of Peru in Cartavio in September 1963. The presence soon included Chimbote in the early 1960s and expanded for a time to Puno and Tacna, on the border of Bolivia and Chile, and finally came to develop an organized presence and pastoral strategy in the Diocese of Chosica. The parish, El Señor de la Esperanza, is about the size of a small diocese in the U.S. Approximately 250,000 Catholics live in a parish that has 19 chapels. In 1982, within the boundaries of Lord of Hope Parish in Canto Grande, the Congregation established &quot;Yancana Huasy&quot; (literally &quot;House of Work&quot; in the language of the Incas). Yancana Huasy attends to the needs of children who live with physical and mental challenges, including Downs&#x27; Syndrome, and their families.

===The Mission of Holy Cross in Uganda===
In November 1958, four Holy Cross priests arrived in Entebbe, Uganda to begin their ministry. The dioceses of Toro and Bunyoro were too large for the bishop to handle. He granted Holy Cross permission to minister to the people of Fort Portal and Butiti. Soon thereafter Holy Cross began administrating St. Leo&#x27;s College, a high school in Kyegobe, Fort Portal diocese. Near Christmas of 1960, Holy Cross began its first parish at Bukwali. Around the end of February 1961, Cardinal Agaginian, the Armenian Patriarch at the time, told Fr. Christopher O&#x27;Toole, CSC, the superior general of Holy Cross, that missionary Vincent J. McCauley was to be made Bishop of Fort Portal. In 1967, a house, and later novitiate (in 1984), was built on the shores of Lake Saaka in Fort Portal. During the military dictatorship of Idi Amin, the Congregation decided at one point to leave the Diocese of Fort Portal. This proposal was later abandoned. Bishop McCauley died on November 1, 1982.

By 1962, the institute had begun accepting Ugandan religious aspirants to the community. Along with other religious institutes, they began a seminary in Kenya called Tangaza in 1986. By 1989, Holy Cross and a consortium of religious congregations and societies established the Queen of Apostles Philosophy Centre in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jinja (&quot;PCJ&quot;) due largely to the political crises between Kenya and Uganda. It was then difficult for Ugandans to study at Tangaza. PCJ was to be a seminary for philosophical and religious studies for these (mostly Ugandan) postulants.

On August 17, 1991, Holy Cross ordained its first Ugandan priest, Fr. Fulgens Katende. Five Holy Cross Brother&#x27;s and one priest died in the genocide of 1994. In Bugembe and Wanyange, two villages of the Jinja Diocese, a primary school and secondary were opened: Holy Cross Primary and Holy Cross Lakeview Secondary respectively. In 1998, Lakeview made world news when United States President Bill Clinton landed in a helicopter on the school&#x27;s compound for discussions with Ugandan President Museveni. A third parish opened in 1994 at Kyrausozi.

In the new millennium the first [East] African district superior of Holy Cross was named in 2003. This was a step towards congregational and district maturity as the past nine superiors had been Americans.

<text>Giuseppe Mercalli (21 May 1850 – 19 March 1914) was an Italian volcanologist and Catholic priest. He is known best for the Mercalli intensity scale for measuring earthquake intensity.

==Biography==
Born in Milan, Mercalli was ordained a Roman Catholic priest and soon became a professor of Natural Sciences at the seminary of Milan. The Italian government appointed him a professor at Domodossola, followed by a job at Reggio di Calabria. He was professor of geology at the University of Catania during the late 1880s and finally was given a job at Naples University. He was also director of the Vesuvius Observatory until the time of his death.

Giuseppe Mercalli also observed eruptions of the volcanoes Stromboli and Vulcano in the Aeolian Islands. His descriptions of these eruptions became the basis for two indices of the volcanic explosivity index: 1 – Strombolian eruption, and 2 – Vulcanian eruption. He also photographed Vesuvius immediately after its eruption in 1906.

In 1914, Mercalli burnt to death under suspicious circumstances, allegedly after knocking over a paraffin lamp in his bedroom. He is thought to have been working through the night, as he often did (he once was found working at 11 a.m. when he had set an examination, upon hearing which he replied, &quot;It surely can&#x27;t be daylight yet!&quot;), when the fatal accident occurred. His body was found, carbonized, by his bed, holding a blanket which he apparently attempted to use to fend off the flames. The authorities, however, stated a few days later that the professor was quite possibly murdered by strangling and soaked in petrol and burned to conceal the crime because they determined that some money (now worth about $1,400) was missing from the professor&#x27;s apartment.

==Intensity scales==
Mercalli devised two earthquake intensity scales, both modifications of the Rossi–Forel scale. The first, now largely forgotten, had six degrees whereas the Rossi–Forel scale had ten. The second, now known as the Mercalli intensity scale, had ten degrees, and elaborated the descriptions in the Rossi–Forel scale.

The Mercalli intensity scale is, in modified form, still used. Unlike the Richter scale, which measures the energy released by an earthquake, the Mercalli intensity scale measures the effects of an earthquake on structures and people. It is poorly suited for measuring earthquakes in sparsely populated areas but useful for comparing damage done by various tremors and historical earthquakes, and for earthquake engineering. The scale currently in use assigns indices ranging from I (&quot;Not felt, except by a few under favorable conditions&quot;), to XII (&quot;Damage total; objects thrown into the air&quot;).

Italian physicist Adolfo Cancani expanded the ten-degree Mercalli scale with the addition of two degrees at the more intense of the scale: XI (catastrophe) and XII (enormous catastrophe). This was later modified by the German geophysicist August Heinrich Sieberg and became known as the Mercalli–Cancani–Sieberg (MCS) scale. This was modified again and published in English by Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann in 1931 as the Mercalli–Wood–Neumann (MWN) scale. It was later improved by Charles Richter, developer of the Richter scale.

<text>The navaga (Eleginus nawaga) is a relatively small species of fish in the cod family Gadidae. It inhabits the European arctic and subarctic waters of the Barents, White, and Kara seas, from the Kola Bay to the Ob River estuary.

Navaga fish usually occur at shallow depths, along shores with soft bottoms, close to the ice and on the continental shelf. In winter, they live in nearshore waters, where spawning takes place. They are often found in estuaries and can enter fresh water in rivers. In summer, they return to open waters. They feed on crustaceans, benthic animals, and small fish. They can grow to at least to 42 cm but typical adult size is smaller, being only 15–25 cm in the White Sea.

The navaga is commercially fished mainly in the winter in the bays of the White Sea. The European navaga is a close relative of the saffron cod (&quot;E. gracilis&quot;), a Pacific sister species.

<text>Prebold () is a settlement in central Slovenia. It is the seat of the Municipality of Prebold. It lies on the edge of the lower Savinja Valley at the northern edge of the Sava Hills west of Celje. The area is part of the traditional region of Styria. The municipality is now included in the Savinja Statistical Region.

==Name==
The name of the settlement was changed from &quot;Sveti Pavel pri Preboldu&quot; (literally, &#x27;Saint Paul near Prebold&#x27;) to &quot;Prebold&quot; in 1952. The name was changed on the basis of the 1948 Law on Names of Settlements and Designations of Squares, Streets, and Buildings as part of efforts by Slovenia&#x27;s postwar communist government to remove religious elements from toponyms. At the time, a proposal was also made for the settlement to be renamed &quot;Šlandrovo&quot; (after the Slovenian communist Slavko Šlander), but it was not carried through. The settlement is also locally known as &quot;Šempavel&quot; (&lt; &quot;Šent Pavel&quot; &#x27;Saint Paul&#x27;). The name &quot;Sveti Pavel&quot; is derived from the church in the settlement, and the name &quot;Prebold&quot; is believed to be derived from German &quot;Prewald&quot;, in turn borrowed from Slovene &quot;preval&quot; &#x27;mountain pass&#x27;. The name &quot;Prebold&quot; formerly referred to a part of the settlement known today as &quot;Graščina&quot;, but may have originally referred to the Vrhe Pass on the route from Prebold to Trbovlje.

==Church==
The parish church in the settlement is dedicated to Saint Paul and belongs to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Celje. It was built in 1898 on the site of a 14th-century church.

<text>The Pequannock River is a tributary of the Pompton River, approximately long, located in northern New Jersey in the United States.

It rises in eastern Sussex County, near Highland Lakes on the north side of Hamburg Mountain. It flows southeast to Stockholm, then east-southeast, in a gap north of Green Pond Mountain and other ridges, past Butler and Bloomingdale. It joins the Ramapo River at Pompton Plains in Pequannock Township to form the Pompton.

In its upper course, it forms part of the county line between Passaic and Morris counties.

It is impounded near its source to form the Oak Ridge Reservoir. The river is relatively unspoiled compared to other rivers in the region. It is a popular spot for recreation trout fishing in its upper reaches. Fishing, hunting, and other recreational uses of the river and watershed are controlled by the City of Newark&#x27;s Division of Watershed Development, which requires permits for all such uses.

The Pequannock watershed is the source of most of Newark&#x27;s water supply. The lands and water were purchased under the mayoralty of Joseph E. Haynes.

<text>Nanaimo—Alberni was a federal electoral district in British Columbia, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1979 to 1988. It was subsequently recreated and was represented in the House of Commons from 1997 to 2015.

==Demographics==
Nanaimo—Alberni has the highest median age of all federal electoral districts in Canada (50.1 years of age).

==Geography==

From 1979 to 1988, it consisted of:
* the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District,
* the Nanaimo Regional District,
* (Lasqueti Island and the adjacent smaller islands in the Powell River Regional District,
* the northwest part of Electoral Area H of the Cowichan Valley Regional District.

The present district includes Lasqueti Island, the Regional District of Alberni-Clayoquot, and all of the Regional District of Nanaimo except the extreme southeastern part, including but the extreme northern part of Nanaimo. The southern part of Nanaimo is part of the Nanaimo—Cowichan electoral district.

==History==

This electoral district was originally created in 1976 from parts of Comox—Alberni and Nanaimo—Cowichan—The Islands ridings.

It was abolished in 1987 when it was redistributed into Comox—Alberni and Nanaimo—Cowichan. It was then re-created in 1996 from those two ridings.

The 2012 electoral redistribution will see this riding dissolved into the new ridings of Courtenay—Alberni and Nanaimo—Ladysmith for the 2015 election.

<doc id="631711" wikidata="Q2561390" url="?curid=631711" title="Comic novel">
<text>A comic novel is a novel-length work of humorous fiction. Many well-known authors have written comic novels, including P. G. Wodehouse, Henry Fielding, Mark Twain, and John Kennedy Toole. Comic novels are often defined by the author&#x27;s literary choice to make the thrust of the work—in its narration or plot—funny or satirical in orientation, regardless of the putative seriousness of the topics addressed.

Novels, books, plays, and many works of fiction or art can certainly contain and include passages or themes that are comic, humorous or satirical, but the defining characteristic of this genre is that comedy is the framework and baseline of the story, rather than an occasional or recurring motif. It is the through-line and organizing genre for the novel&#x27;s tone, orientation and sensibility. A reader is not expected to &#x27;find&#x27; or &#x27;discover&#x27; a humorous moment within the reality of the text, rather, humor is the ongoing mood, like a comedy movie, rather than a movie that has some comedy or laughs within it.

Literary scholars distinguish textual analysis on this basis; the theory being that a story by Mark Twain that is a satirical critique in its very origin, for example, must be understood differently than a more literal novelistic plot.

==Notable authors of comic novels==

===British===

One of the most notable British comic novelists is P. G. Wodehouse, whose work follows on from that of Jerome K. Jerome, George Grossmith, and Weedon Grossmith (see &quot;The Diary of a Nobody)&quot;. Saki&#x27;s work is also significant, although his career was cut short by World War I.

A. G. Macdonell and G. K. Chesterton also produced flights of whimsy.

Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; was a notable mid-18th century work in the genre.

More contemporary British humorists are George MacDonald Fraser, Tom Sharpe, Kingsley Amis, Terry Pratchett, Richard Gordon, Rob Grant, Douglas Adams, Evelyn Waugh, Anthony Powell, Nick Hornby, Helen Fielding, Eric Sykes, Leslie Thomas, Stephen Fry, Richard Asplin, Mike Harding, Joseph Connolly, and Ben Elton.

===Irish===

James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; is considered by some to be a comic novel.

===American===

Notable American comic novelists include Mark Twain, Richard Brautigan, Philip Roth, John Kennedy Toole, James Wilcox, John Swartzwelder, Larry Doyle, Jennifer Weiner, Carl Hiaasen, Joseph Heller, Peter De Vries, Thomas Pynchon, Kurt Vonnegut, Terry Southern, and Christopher Moore.

<text>Mister Miracle is the name of three fictional superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first and third are humans Thaddeus Brown and [[Mister Miracle (Shilo Norman)|Shilo Norman]], while the second is New God Scott Free. The Scott Free incarnation of Mister Miracle first appeared in &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; #1 (April 1971) and was created by Jack Kirby.

The Scott Free incarnation of Mister Miracle has appeared in various media outside comics, primarily in association with the New Gods. Ioan Gruffudd, Yuri Lowenthal, Roger Craig Smith, and Andy Daly have voiced the character in animation.

==Publication history==
Mister Miracle debuted in the first issue of the eponymous series cover dated April 1971 as part of the Fourth World tetralogy. Big Barda, the character&#x27;s love interest, was introduced in &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; #4 (October 1971). According to creator Jack Kirby&#x27;s then-assistant Mark Evanier, Kirby wanted to be a comics creator and creative supervisor at DC Comics, rather than a regular writer-artist: &quot;... we were going to turn &quot;Mr. Miracle&quot; over to Steve Ditko after a couple of issues and have me write it and Ditko draw it. Carmine Infantino, publisher of DC at the time, vetoed that and said Kirby had to do it all himself.&quot; Evanier unofficially co-wrote most issues of the series.

The original title featuring Miracle was the longest-lasting of the Fourth World titles, lasting 18 issues while the other titles, &quot;New Gods&quot; and &quot;The Forever People&quot;, were cancelled after only 11 issues. The most traditionally super-heroesque comic of the various Fourth World titles, the last seven issues as well as later incarnations of the series would downplay the Fourth World mythology in favor of more traditional superhero fare. The character teamed up with Batman three times in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;. The title was revived in September 1977 by Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers. Steve Gerber and Michael Golden produced three issues ending with #25 (September 1978) with several story lines unresolved. Mister Miracle teamed with Superman in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #12 (August 1979) and met the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #183–185 (October–December 1980).

When the character was revived as part of the &quot;Justice League International&quot; lineup in 1987, a one-shot special by writer Mark Evanier and artist Steve Rude was published in 1987. This special was followed by an ongoing series that began in January 1989, written by J. M. DeMatteis and drawn by Ian Gibson. Other writers who contributed to the title include Keith Giffen, Len Wein, and Doug Moench. This run lasted 28 issues before cancellation in 1991. The series was largely humor-driven, per Giffen&#x27;s reimagining Scott Free, his wife Big Barda, and their friend Oberon, who pretended to be Scott&#x27;s uncle, as living in suburbia when they were not fighting evil with the Justice League.

In 1996, a series written by Kevin Dooley showed Scott attempting to escape his destiny as a New God by working for a charitable foundation in New York. This ran for seven issues, before all Fourth World titles were canceled for the launch of &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot;.

In addition, Scott&#x27;s ally and wife Big Barda was made a member of the revived Justice League and appeared regularly in the &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; series by John Byrne.

With the launching of Grant Morrison&#x27;s meta-series &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; (2005–2006), Mister Miracle was revived as a four-issue miniseries. This miniseries focused instead on Scott&#x27;s sidekick and apprentice Shilo Norman, who died.

In 2017, the character returned in a 12-issue limited series written by Tom King and illustrated by Mitch Gerads.

From July 2021 to January 2022, &quot;Mister Miracle: The Source of Freedom&quot; was published as a six issue miniseries starring Shilo Norman as Mister Miracle. The series was written by Brandon Easton and drawn by Fico Ossio.

==Fictional character biography==
&quot;Mister Miracle&quot; was one of four DC Comics series in Kirby&#x27;s ambitious, but short-lived, Fourth World saga. Mister Miracle, Super Escape Artist was inspired by comic book writer/artist Jim Steranko. Mister Miracle&#x27;s relationship with his wife Big Barda is based on Kirby&#x27;s relationship with his own wife Roz.

===Thaddeus Brown===
Thaddeus Brown was a circus escape artist whose stage name was Mister Miracle. As the first escape artist to use the name Mister Miracle, Brown earned a modest living and practiced his art into his later years. Brown met Scott Free as he was practicing an outdoor escape with his long-time friend and assistant Oberon. Scott then aided Brown as he was being coerced by Intergang thugs working for Intergang member Steel Hand by fighting them off. Unbeknownst to Scott, Intergang was an Earth crime organization run by Darkseid. Brown then told Scott that he was being harassed by the local Intergang Capo known as Steel Hand. Brown and Steel Hand had been in a hospital together and made a bet that Brown could not escape death. While practicing an escape of being tied to a tree with a projectile speeding toward him, Brown was shot by a sniper working for Steel Hand while Scott and Oberon stood by helplessly. After Brown&#x27;s murder, Scott put on Brown&#x27;s costume and exacted his revenge on Steel Hand by bringing him down. Scott Free took up the Mister Miracle name and hired his assistant Oberon. Scott and Oberon, later joined by Big Barda, toured the country as the Mister Miracle Super Escape Artist show.

Thaddeus was later revealed to have a son named Ted.

In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;. Thaddeus was one of Batman&#x27;s teachers, educating him in the art of escape.

At the end of the &quot;Flashpoint Beyond&quot; limited series, Thaddeus Brown was among the Thirteen in the custody of the Time Masters. The capsules containing Thaddeus and those with him were found to have failed and they were pulled back to the 1940s where history is rebuilding around them.

During &quot;The New Golden Age&quot;, Thaddeus Brown&#x27; bio revealed that his history of being shot by a sniper working for Steel Hand remains intact, though it is claimed that Ted and a few people might know that Thaddeus faked his death. Mister Miracle was revealed to have been part of a group called the Justice Society Dark. In 1941, Doctor Fate and Salem the Witch Girl came across Mister Miracle fighting Solomon Grundy while Zatara and Diamond Jack were having a spat. After Solomon Grundy was chained up, Mister Miracle suggested to Doctor Fate and Salem the Witch Girl that they should go apprehend Bride of Grundy.

===Scott Free===

Scott Free is the son of Highfather, the ruler of New Genesis, and his wife, Avia. As part of a diplomatic move to stop a war with the planet Apokolips, Highfather agreed to an exchange of heirs with the galactic tyrant Darkseid. The exchange of heirs as hostages was supposed to guarantee that neither side would attack the other. Scott was traded for Darkseid&#x27;s second-born son Orion.

Scott grew up in one of Granny Goodness&#x27; &quot;Terror Orphanages&quot; with no knowledge of his heritage, but still refused to allow his spirit to break under the institution&#x27;s torturous training. As he matured, Scott rebelled against the totalitarian ideology of Apokolips. Hating himself for being unable to fit in despite his unfailing defiance of the abuse he suffered, Scott was influenced by Metron to see a future beyond Darkseid. Scott became part of a small band of pupils led by Himon, a New Genesian living under cover as a Hunger Dog on Apokolips. It was at these meetings that Scott met Lieutenant Big Barda of Darkseid&#x27;s Female Furies who would later become his wife.

Eventually, Free escaped and fled to Earth. His escape, long anticipated and planned for by Darkseid, nullified the pact between Darkseid and Highfather; giving Darkseid the excuse he needed to revive the war with New Genesis. Once on Earth, Free met circus escape artist Thaddeus Brown, whose stage name was Mister Miracle. Brown was impressed with Scott&#x27;s skills (especially as supplemented with various advanced devices he had taken from his previous home). Scott befriended Brown&#x27;s assistant, a dwarf named Oberon. When Thaddeus Brown was murdered, Free assumed the identity of Mister Miracle. Barda later followed Scott to Earth and the two used their New Gods powers, equipment and skills in the war against Darkseid, who was still interested in recapturing both of them. Eventually, tired of being chased on Earth by Darkseid&#x27;s servants, Scott returned to Apokolips and won his freedom by legal means, through trial by combat.

Scott later met Brown&#x27;s son Ted.

Free later became a member of the &quot;Justice League International&quot; as did Barda and Oberon, which recast him and Big Barda as semi-retired super-heroes that sought to live quiet lives in the suburbs when they were not involved in Justice League-related adventures. In particular, Free was recast as a hen-pecked husband, who often found himself on the receiving end of his wife&#x27;s temper over her desire to live a quiet life on Earth.

During his time in the League, Scott developed an intense rivalry with Justice League villain Manga Khan. The villainous intergalactic trader and black marketer repeatedly kidnapped Scott, ultimately convincing Scott&#x27;s conniving former manager Funky Flashman into forging documents forcing Scott to work for Manga as his personal entertainer. To force him to go along willingly, Khan replaced Scott with a lifelike robot who was ultimately murdered by Despero during his first mission with the Justice League. Scott ultimately escaped from Manga Khan&#x27;s clutches and reunited with his wife and friends, though the shock was enough to cause Scott to ultimately quit the League and to take on a protégé in the form of Shilo Norman.

In the conclusion of &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, many of the New Gods are all seemingly reborn. Among their numbers are the apparently resurrected Mister Miracle and Barda.

In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Mister Miracle appears alongside Big Barda flying around the ruins of Gotham City on Earth 2. Their purpose is revealed to find the mysterious new Batman, which is thwarted when both are attacked by Fury.

===Shilo Norman===
Abandoned by his mother when he was only an infant, Shilo Norman&#x27;s desire to escape was fostered in an abusive orphanage. 

He eventually ran away and ended up on the streets near the informal ward of escapologist Thaddeus Brown (the original Mister Miracle), and he served as an occasional stand-in. When Brown was murdered by Intergang mobster Steel Hand, Scott Free avenged his new friend&#x27;s death by taking on the identity of Mister Miracle and brought Steel Hand to justice. After Brown&#x27;s death, Shilo worked with Scott and his wife Barda. A master escape artist himself, the now-adult Shilo was appointed security chief of the Slabside Island Maximum Security prison for Metahumans known as the Slab. He held his own during the Joker&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh&quot; riot and was promoted to Warden of the Slab, which had by then been relocated to Antarctica. A somewhat reconceived Shilo Norman appears in Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; crossover. In &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #2, Shilo tells Sonny Sumo &quot;There was a cosmic war and the powers of evil won&quot;, prompting him to form a team to fight the evil gods. Shilo was later summoned by Nix Uotan to fight against Mandrakk the Dark Monitor.

Shilo would later appear as Mister Miracle alongside his other Seven Soldiers team mates in Morrison and Dan DiDio&#x27;s series &quot;Sideways&quot;.

Shilo Norman&#x27;s Mister Miracle also appears in &quot;Mister Miracle: The Source of Freedom&quot;, a six-issue miniseries spinning out of the events of &quot;DC Future State&quot; and tying into &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;.

==Powers and abilities==
Like all the New Gods, Scott Free is functionally immortal; having stopped aging around the age of 30, he has developed an immunity to toxins and diseases. Scott has superhuman strength, agility, speed, coordination and reflexes, along with incredible stamina. Due to his exhausting and rigorous life on Apokolips, his body has tremendous resistance to extreme temperatures, physical injury, psychic influence and he is capable of extremely rapid recovery.
Scott has a genius-level intellect and is knowledgeable about much of the universe. During his life on Apokolips, he was instructed by Himon in the science and use of advanced Fourth World&#x27;s technology. He is a genius inventor who has designed most of the equipment in his costume, including his Mother Box.

Scott was trained by Granny Goodness as an Aero-trooper. Although he despises violence and is often portrayed as a pacifist, he is still an exceptional warrior, instructed in all combat techniques of Apokolips and very skilled with weapons. On one occasion, he was able to beat Big Barda. Also, he is a master escapologist and acrobat. He is considered better at escapes than Batman, and much of his skill is the result of his advanced physiology.

Scott Free is heir of the Alpha Effect, the antithesis of Darkseid&#x27;s Omega Energy. This power was almost unlimited and allowed him to manipulate energy in many ways; for example, he was able to knock out &quot;The Asgardian God Thor&quot;, draining his vital power. Also, Mister Miracle used his godlike powers to resurrect his wife and battle against Steppenwolf and Kalibak, temporarily stopping the war between New Genesis and Apokolips. Later, Scott relinquished his heritage.

Scott possesses greater power as the embodiment of the Anti-Life Equation. The ability is fueled by rage and negative emotions. The Anti-Life Equation can give any being the power to dominate the will of all sentient and sapient races and alter the reality, space, time, matter and anti-matter at the cosmic level. Mister Miracle proved to be powerful enough to fight Superman and Orion together.

===The New 52===
In The New 52 rebooted DC continuity, Mister Miracle retains the status of a New God and has been reborn more powerful than before. Mister Miracle is able to lift at least 50 tons. He is shown to have a high level of invulnerability; enduring space&#x27;s rigors, surviving the explosion of three &quot;Boom Spheres&quot;, resisting attacks of powerful beings such as Darkseid. His combined reflexes, speed and agility make him able to dodge almost any attack, even from two Apokalitian assassins, as he did with Lashina and Kanto. In addition, Mister Miracle has a limited healing factor and a great variety of mental tricks that allow him to break free of psychic influence. Mister Miracle is still a super escape artist and an expert combatant, successfully defeating Fury, Wonder Woman&#x27;s daughter.

===Equipment===
* Mother Box: The Mother Box can access the energy of the Source for various effects; it can change the gravitational constant of an area, transfer energy from one place to another, sense danger, sense of life, create force fields, transmute matter, absorb or project powerful shock blasts, create electro-webs of atoms, control the mental state of a being, communicate telepathically with a host or other life form, manipulate the life-force of a host to sustain it past fatal injuries, teletransportation, open and close Boom Tubes, and more.
* Costume: Mister Miracle&#x27;s costume is magnetically sealed and provides limited protection from damage and fire. It contains numerous hidden pockets. Each glove and boot has a pocket and the slim utility belt contains half a dozen more. A secret pocket on the upper right arm hides his Mother Box. 
* Mask: Contains circuitry for his Mother Box and a life support unit. The circuits let Scott use his Mother Box hands free. The life support system lets him survive in hostile environments.
* Gloves: Have wide cuffs that hold Scott&#x27;s multi-cube and assorted picks. In addition, the gloves can fire concussive blasts and generate enormous electric power, and contain a fingertip laser for fine welding or burning. His hidden circuits have the ability to create fission blasts and mini shockwaves.
* Boots: Contain laser-jets capable of burning almost any surface.
* Cape: Is made of a memory fibroid from New Genesis. Scott&#x27;s Mother Box can transmute the cape into a cocoon that can withstand a sizable explosion. This can only be done once. The transmutation is not permanent and destroys the cape.
* Aero Discs: Thin metal plates about a foot across. The New Gods use them for personal travel. They can reach speeds of 250 mph. Scott has modified his discs considerably for battle. They can be attached to the forearms to use them as shields or blades. 
* Multi-Cube: A peripheral device for Mister Miracle&#x27;s Mother Box. The cube was designed by Mister Miracle to use the transmutation power of the Mother Box to create a number of preset mechanisms in its interior. All of these functions are much easier to perform than improvised transmutation. They can be activated in stressful situations. The cube is small enough to be hidden in the palm of the hand. The multi-cube is not sentient but is still capable of interpreting complex commands and recording data. The multi-cube can fly under its own power and follow the mental commands of Mister Miracle. The cube can use the transmuting power of the Mother Box to create several hundred feet of swing line. Besides the cable, the cube can produce a smoke screen or fire suppression foam. The simplest use of the cube is to generate light effects. The cube can create lifelike holograms, a blinding flash or a laser capable of cutting through a steel cable or handcuff links. In hologram mode the cube can record extended scenes or make a complete holographic recording. It can then manipulate the playback to simulate the subject in motion. The cube can emit a powerful sonic beam that can spring locks or shatter a brick wall. The sound blast can stun an unprotected human.

<text>In neuroscience, tractography is a 3D modeling technique used to visually represent nerve tracts using data collected by diffusion MRI. It uses special techniques of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer-based diffusion MRI. The results are presented in two- and three-dimensional images called tractograms.

In addition to the long tracts that connect the brain to the rest of the body, there are complicated neural circuits formed by short connections among different cortical and subcortical regions. The existence of these tracts and circuits has been revealed by histochemistry and biological techniques on post-mortem specimens. Nerve tracts are not identifiable by direct exam, CT, or MRI scans. This difficulty explains the paucity of their description in neuroanatomy atlases and the poor understanding of their functions.

The most advanced tractography algorithm can produce 90% of the ground truth bundles, but it still contains a substantial amount of invalid results.

== MRI technique ==

Tractography is performed using data from diffusion MRI. The free water diffusion is termed &quot;isotropic&quot; diffusion. If the water diffuses in a medium with barriers, the diffusion will be uneven, which is termed anisotropic diffusion. In such a case, the relative mobility of the molecules from the origin has a shape different from a sphere. This shape is often modeled as an ellipsoid, and the technique is then called diffusion tensor imaging. Barriers can be many things: cell membranes, axons, myelin, etc.; but in white matter the principal barrier is the myelin sheath of axons. Bundles of axons provide a barrier to perpendicular diffusion and a path for parallel diffusion along the orientation of the fibers.

Anisotropic diffusion is expected to be increased in areas of high mature axonal order. Conditions where the myelin or the structure of the axon are disrupted, such as trauma, tumors, and inflammation reduce anisotropy, as the barriers are affected by destruction or disorganization.

Anisotropy is measured in several ways. One way is by a ratio called fractional anisotropy (FA). An FA of 0 corresponds to a perfect sphere, whereas 1 is an ideal linear diffusion. Few regions have FA larger than 0.90. The number gives information about how aspherical the diffusion is but says nothing of the direction.

Each anisotropy is linked to an orientation of the predominant axis (predominant direction of the diffusion). Post-processing programs are able to extract this directional information.

This additional information is difficult to represent on 2D grey-scaled images. To overcome this problem, a color code is introduced. Basic colors can tell the observer how the fibers are oriented in a 3D coordinate system, this is termed an &quot;anisotropic map&quot;. The software could encode the colors in this way:
* Red indicates directions in the &quot;X&quot; axis: right to left or left to right.
* Green indicates directions in the &quot;Y&quot; axis: posterior to anterior or from anterior to posterior.
* Blue indicates directions in the &quot;Z&quot; axis: inferior to superior or vice versa.

The technique is unable to discriminate the &quot;positive&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; direction in the same axis.

== Mathematics ==

Using diffusion tensor MRI, one can measure the apparent diffusion coefficient at each voxel in the image, and after multilinear regression across multiple images, the whole diffusion tensor can be reconstructed.

Suppose there is a fiber tract of interest in the sample. Following the Frenet–Serret formulas, we can formulate the space-path of the fiber tract as a parameterized curve:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the tangent vector of the curve. The reconstructed diffusion tensor formula_3 can be treated as a matrix, and we can compute its eigenvalues formula_4 and eigenvectors formula_5. By equating the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue with the direction of the curve:

:formula_6

we can solve for formula_7 given the data for formula_8. This can be done using numerical integration, e.g., using Runge–Kutta, and by interpolating the principal eigenvectors.

<text>Vancouver Quadra is a federal electoral district in the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada. It has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada since 1949. The constituency bears the name of the Spanish explorer who surveyed the area in 1775, Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra. Since 2007, the riding has been represented by Liberal MP Joyce Murray, who has served in the 29th ministry under Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau.

Within the boundaries of this riding are the University of British Columbia and the western portions of the affluent West Side of Vancouver. Voters within Vancouver Quadra have tended to elect centrist candidates, which is an exception to the province as a whole where politics has tended to be more polarized. Though the Liberals have held the seat since 1984, MPs tend to be on the right wing of the party. For example, the current MP, Joyce Murray, was previously a cabinet minister in the centre-right British Columbia Liberal Party, which is unaffiliated with the federal Liberal party and attracts the vast majority of voters who vote for the Conservative Party of Canada in federal elections.

==Demographics==

This is the sixth wealthiest riding in Canada, with an average family income of over $145,000. As of 2006, this riding had 37% immigrants, most of whom are Chinese-Canadians. The province&#x27;s largest university, the University of British Columbia, is situated in this riding. The major employer is the professional, scientific and technical service sector. The unemployment rate is 5.2%. Nearly every single-family house in this riding is worth over a million dollars; the median house value is over 2 million dollars.

The Vancouver Quadra riding has a very high level of educational attainment; it has the highest percentage of people with a university certificate or degree in all of Canada (53.1%) and also tops the following educational attainment sub-categories:

* Earned doctorate: 4.7%
* Degree in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine or optometry: 2.5%
* Bachelor&#x27;s degree: 27.4%

&quot;According to the 2016 Canadian census&quot;:

Languages: 66.0% English, 1.6% French, 31.3% other, 1.1% multiple languages 
Religions: 27.9% Protestant, 16.3% Catholic, 4.5% Buddhist, 4.2% Other Christian, 3.8% Jewish, 2.4% Christian Orthodox, 1.1% Muslim, 38.5% no religious affiliation 
Average income: $46,991

==Geography==
The district includes the parts of the West Side of Vancouver and the University of British Columbia Endowment Lands.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1947 from Vancouver East and Vancouver South ridings. It was a swing riding for most of its first four decades. However, in 1984, John Turner, then Prime Minister, unseated Progressive Conservative incumbent Bill Clarke even as Turner&#x27;s Liberals suffered what was then the biggest seat loss in Canadian history. It was one of only two Liberal-held seats west of Ontario. The seat has stayed in Liberal hands ever since.

The 2012 federal electoral boundaries redistribution concluded that the electoral boundaries of Vancouver Quadra should be adjusted, and a modified electoral district of the same name will be contested in future elections. The redefined Vancouver Quadra loses a portion of its current territory east of the Arbutus Corridor to the new district of Vancouver Granville. These new boundaries were legally defined in the 2013 representation order, which came into effect upon the call of the 42nd Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 2015.

===Historical boundaries===

==Members of Parliament==
This riding has elected the following members of Parliament:










===Current member of Parliament===

Its member of Parliament (MP) is Joyce Murray (Liberal), a former British Columbia cabinet minister and provincial Member of the Legislative Assembly. She was first elected in a March 2008 by-election, by a small margin. Murray was re-elected in the general elections of 2008, 2011 and 2015 with larger margins. She was again re-elected in the 2019 and 2021 federal elections, albeit by reduced margins.

<doc id="631730" wikidata="Q7289019" url="?curid=631730" title="Ramapo River">
<text>The Ramapo River is a tributary of the Pompton River, approximately 30 mi (48 km) long, in southern New York and northern New Jersey in the United States.

==Course==
The Ramapo River rises in Round Lake, a small freshwater lake in the Town of Monroe, New York, in a mountainous area of central Orange County, New York. It flows southeast through the village, where the river was dammed in 1741 for a sawmill and grist mill. It continues to Harriman, where a chemical plant, Nepera Chemical, was built. While the plant has been dismantled, a superfund site has been designated at the location where barrels of toxic chemicals were buried. At Harriman, the river turns south into western Rockland County, where it flows through the hamlet and town of Ramapo, New York, then into northern Bergen County, New Jersey. In New Jersey, it flows southwest along the east side of the ridge of the Ramapo Mountains. Following a course that runs above the Ramapo Fault for about 9 mi (14 km), the river then flows into Potash Lake in Oakland, and from there into Pompton Lake in Pompton Lakes. The river then flows out of Pompton Lake, forming the border between Pompton Lakes and Wayne. The Ramapo forms a confluence with the Pequannock River along the border between Pequannock and Wayne, forming the Pompton River, which eventually flows into the Passaic River. A portion of the river&#x27;s water is diverted to the nearby Wanaque Reservoir.

The river is a popular destination for fly fishing of trout. New York State Route 17, the Port Jervis commuter railroad line, and the New York State Thruway were all constructed in the valley of the river between Harriman and Suffern, New York.

==History==
Areas along the Ramapo River were inhabited by bands of the Lenape tribe, a large group who inhabited much of the coastal areas of the mid-Atlantic region. Some of their people retreated to the mountains under pressure from Dutch and English colonists. The Lenape occupied western Long Island, the area of present-day metropolitan New York, northern and southern New Jersey, and the Delaware River Valley south through Pennsylvania into Delaware.

Many smaller archeological sites in Oakland, New Jersey were found to have been inhabited by prehistoric indigenous peoples. Fossilized crustaceans can be found along the banks of the river near Oakland.

Descendants of the Lenape include the Ramapough Lenape Indian Tribe (also known as the Ramapough Mountain Indians), recognized in 1980 by the state of New Jersey. Many Ramapough Lenape people have lived in what is now Mahwah and Ringwood, New Jersey and Hillburn, New York since the late colonial period. They also intermarried with people of other ethnicities.

Torne Mountain (; shown on topographic maps as &quot;High Torne&quot;), in Harriman State Park, overlooks the Ramapo Pass and remnants of the once-thriving Ramapo Iron Works. During the American Revolution, the Torne served as a lookout for British ship movements on the Hudson. Legend tells that Gen. George Washington lost his watch on the mountain, and it may still be heard ticking up there in a crevice of rock.

<doc id="631731" wikidata="Q3289676" url="?curid=631731" title="March for Women's Lives (2004)">
<text>The March for Women&#x27;s Lives was a protest demonstration held on April 25, 2004 at the National Mall in Washington, D. C. There was approximately 1.3 million participants. The demonstration was led by seven groups; National Organization for Women, American Civil Liberties Union, Black Women’s Health Imperative, Feminist Majority, NARAL Pro Choice America, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The march was intended to address topics such as abortion rights, reproductive health care, women&#x27;s rights, and others. Originally named the March for Freedom, the march was renamed in an effort to expand the message of &quot;pro-choice&quot; to include the right to have children, access to pre and post natal care, as well as sex education that were not always accessible for women of color. 

The Women&#x27;s March was notable for its inclusivity and diversity, with participants from all walks of life, ages, races, genders, and sexual orientations coming together to advocate for progressive causes. The event featured speeches and performances by a range of prominent figures, including celebrities, politicians, and activists. 

While the Women&#x27;s March was criticized by some for its lack of a clear agenda or policy platform, its organizers argued that its primary goal was to show support for the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of their background or identity. The march was seen as a powerful symbol of resistance and unity in the face of what many saw as a threat to progress and equality.

==Events and participants==

A rally on the Mall began at 10 a.m., and was followed by a march through downtown Washington, with a route along Pennsylvania Avenue. Celebrities who appeared at the march included Peter, Paul, and Mary, Indigo Girls, Judy Gorman, Susan Sarandon, Whoopi Goldberg, Ashley Judd, Kathleen Turner, Ted Turner, Ana Gasteyer, Janeane Garofalo, Bonnie Franklin, Julianne Moore, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; also appearing were veteran abortion rights leaders, such as Kate Michelman of NARAL Pro-Choice America and Gloria Steinem, and many members of Congress.

The march was led by seven organizing groups: National Organization for Women (NOW), American Civil Liberties Union, Black Women&#x27;s Health Imperative, Feminist Majority Foundation, NARAL Pro Choice America, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. More than 1,400 organizations co- sponsored the event including Choice USA, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Code Pink, and the National association of Social Workers. Two other groups that assisted in organizing women of color included the National Network of Abortion Funds and Sister Song .

Sixteen protesters from the Christian Defense Coalition were arrested for demonstrating without a permit when they crossed police barricades into the area designated for the March.

<text>The Great Fear () was a general panic that took place between 22 July to 6 August 1789, at the start of the French Revolution. Rural unrest had been present in France since the worsening grain shortage of the spring. Fuelled by rumours of an aristocrats&#x27; &quot;famine plot&quot; to starve or burn out the population, both peasants and townspeople mobilised in many regions.

In response to those rumours, fearful peasants armed themselves in self-defense and, in some areas, attacked manor houses. The content of the rumors differed from region to region. In some areas, it was believed that a foreign force was burning the crops in the fields, and in other areas, it was believed that robbers were burning buildings. Fear of the peasant revolt was a contributing factor to the abolition of seigneurialism in France through the August Decrees.

== Event ==
=== Causes ===

The French historian Georges Lefebvre has demonstrated that the revolt in the countryside can be followed in remarkable detail. The revolt had both economic and political causes, predating the events of the summer of 1789. As Lefebvre commented, &quot;To get the peasant to rise and revolt, there was no need of the French Revolution, as so many historians have suggested: when the panic came he was already up and away&quot;.

The rural unrest can be traced back to the spring of 1788, when a drought threatened the prospect of the coming harvest. Harvests had already been poor since the massive 1783 Laki eruption in Iceland. Storms and floods also destroyed much of the harvest during the summer, leading to both a decrease in seigneurial dues and defaults on leases. Frosts and snow damaged vines, and ruined chestnut and olive groves in the south. Vagrancy became a serious problem in the countryside, and in some areas, such as the Franche-Comté in late 1788, peasants gathered to take collective action against the seigneurs.

The historian Mary Kilbourne Matossian argued that one of the causes of the Great Fear was consumption of ergot, a hallucinogenic fungus. In years of good harvests, rye that was contaminated with ergot was discarded, but when the harvest was poor, the peasants could not afford to be so choosy.

=== Development ===
The panic began in the Franche-Comté, spread south along the Rhône valley to Provence, east towards the Alps and west towards the centre of France. Almost simultaneously, a panic began in Ruffec, south of Poitiers, and travelled to the Pyrenees, toward Berry and into the Auvergne. The uprising coalesced into a general Great Fear, as neighbouring villages mistook armed peasants for brigands. 

During the attacks by the peasants on the estates of the feudal nobility and convent estates, their main objective was reported to have been finding and destroying the documents of the feudal privileges, which granted the feudal lords their feudal privileges over the peasantry, and burn them. In some cases, the manor houses were burned along with the documents. Hundreds of manor houses are reported to have been burned this way, however the houses burnt belonged to the minority of those attacked, and there was no indiscriminate pillaging.In most cases, the peasants simply left when the letters of feudal privileges had been destroyed, rather than burning the house. 

The members of the feudal aristocracy normally fled from their castles and were rarely subjected to violence, being located by the militia who were sent to reinstate order after the end of the uprising. 
Of those aristocrats captured by the peasants, most were simply forced to leave their estates; only a minority were reported to have been subjected to mistreatment such as beatings and humiliation, and there are only three confirmed cases of a landlord actually having been killed during the uprising.

Although the Great Fear is usually associated with the peasantry, all of the uprisings tended to involve all sectors of the local community, including some elite participants, such as artisans or well-to-do farmers. Often, the bourgeoisie had just as much to gain from the destruction of the feudal regime as the poorer peasantry.

Although the main phase of the Great Fear died out by August, peasant uprisings continued well into 1790 and left few areas of France (primarily Alsace, Lorraine and Brittany) untouched. As a result of the Great Fear, the National Assembly, in an effort to appease the peasants and forestall further rural disorders, on 4 August 1789, formally abolished the &quot;feudal regime&quot;, including seigneurial rights. That led in effect to a general unrest among the French nobility.

== Comparison with previous peasant revolts ==
Peasant revolt was not a phenomenon new to late-18th-century France. The 14th century saw the Jacquerie in the Oise Valley, and the seventeenth century saw the Croquant rebellions. Yves-Marie Bercé, in &quot;History of the Peasant Revolts&quot;, concludes &quot;peasant revolts of the years 1789 to 1792 had much in common with their seventeenth-century counterparts: unanimity of the rural community, rejection of new taxation to which they were unaccustomed, defiance of enemy townsmen and a belief that there would be a general remission in taxes, particularly when the king decided to convene the estates general. In spite of all that is suggested by the political history of the period, the peasant disturbances at the beginning of the French Revolution did not depart from the typical community revolt of the preceding century&quot;.

The usual cause of communal violence was &quot;an assault launched from outside upon the community as a whole&quot;, whether the outsider was those profiting from unfairly high bread prices, marauding bandits, witches or magistrates abusing power. That statement about 16th- and 17th-century uprisings appears at first to apply equally to the Great Fear of 1789. However, one distinctive aspect of the latter was fear of an ambiguous outsider at the outset of the disturbance.

Whether the brigands were English, Piedmontese or merely vagabonds was not easily determined, and when the Great Fear had spread to its largest expanse, it was a system, feudalism, rather than a specific person or group, at which its animosity was directed. Earlier revolts had not been subversive but rather looked to a golden age, which participants wished to see reinstated. The sociopolitical system was implicitly validated by a critique of recent changes in favour of tradition and custom. The &quot;Cahiers de doléances&quot; had opened the door to the people’s opinion directly affecting circumstances and policy, and the Great Fear evidenced that change.

The most glaring difference between the Great Fear of 1789 and previous peasant revolts was its scope. Spreading from half-a-dozen or so separate nuclei across the countryside, almost all of France found itself in rural uproar. In the 16th and the 17th centuries, revolts were almost always contained within the borders of a single province.

That change in magnitude reflects to what extent social discontent was with the entire governmental system (and its ineffectiveness), rather than with anything particular to a locality. As Tackett argues, the specific manifestation of the fear of brigands (who they were and what they were most likely to attack) may have been contingent upon local contexts, but the fact that the brigands were perceived as a genuine threat to the peasants across the country in a wide variety of local contexts speaks to a more systemic disorder.

Comparing the peasant revolts of the Tard Avisés with the Great Fear of 1789 reveals some key similarities and differences. From 1593 to 1595 in Limousin and Périgord, groups of peasants rose up against the armed forces that occupied the countryside and raised funds by levying taxes and ransom. In a series of assemblies, the Croquants, as they were pejoratively called, worked on a military plan for action and successfully expelled the garrisons from their lands. The letters between those assemblies justified their armed resistance as opposition to unjust claims on their property. When the chaotic political situation was stabilized with the coronation of Henry IV, the revolts ended, and the peasants were eventually accorded the tax rebate they had demanded earlier. The Tard-Avisés had specific goals and achieved them.

The same cannot be said of the participants in the Great Fear of 1789, which broke with another pattern typical of peasant revolts in earlier centuries. The panic lasted for more than a few weeks and took place during the most labour-intensive months. Communal violence was but one tactic of many for opposing an enemy, and 16th- and 17th-century peasants, drawing on a heritage of communal justice, might rise up to prevent enclosement of a communal grazing space like a marsh to demand lower bread prices or to evade their taxes.

During the reign of Louis XIV, however, popular revolt became an ever-less viable option for reform, as the state both became better able to respond to insurgency and addressed many of the issues at the heart of peasant revolts. Reforms in the military structure prevented French soldiers from plundering French soil, and armed conflict with other powers was not fought at home. Thus, the threat of roaming bandits was a particularly poignant one, which evoked an era of lawlessness thaf the French monarchy had successfully countered in previous years.

There was much in common between the peasantry in the Great Fear of 1789 and the peasants of the revolts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but they were malleable and changed by the experience of Bourbon rule and its subsequent dissolution. Without the monarchy or a replacement government to administer and protect the people, the harvest and, with it, life itself were in grave danger.

<text>Isaac Peckham Christiancy (March 12, 1812September 8, 1890) was chief justice of the Michigan State Supreme Court and U.S. Senator from the state of Michigan.

Christiancy was born near Johnstown, New York in what is now Bleecker, New York to parents of humble means. His grandfather, Isaac Peckham, was one of the first pioneers in Caroga, New York, settling in the area as early as 1783. Christiancy attended the common schools and the Johnstown and Ovid Academies. After his father died when he was 13, he also had to support his family. He taught school and studied law. In 1836, Christiancy was admitted to the bar after moving to Monroe, Michigan, where he obtained a clerkship in a Federal land office. He married Elizabeth E. McClosky on November 16, 1839.

He was prosecuting attorney for Monroe County, Michigan from 1841 to 1846. In 1848 he was a delegate to the Free Soil Party convention in Buffalo, New York, having left the Democratic Party over the question of slavery.

He was a member of the Michigan State Senate from 1850 to 1852 and an unsuccessful Free Soil Party candidate for governor in 1852. He helped to organize the Republican Party in Jackson, Michigan in 1854. He purchased the &quot;Monroe Commercial&quot; in 1857 and became its editor. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate in that year.

Pursuant to the new state constitution adopted in 1850, the Michigan Legislature created a permanent State Supreme Court in 1857. Christiancy was elected as an associate judge of this first permanent Michigan Supreme Court. He was reelected twice and served until February 27, 1875, when he resigned to take the office of U.S. Senator. He served as chief justice from 1872 to 1874. Christiancy is known as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Michigan judicial history for his service while on the court.

He was elected as a Republican to the U.S. Senate in 1874, defeating the incumbent Radical Republican Zachariah Chandler, and served in the 44th and 45th Congresses from March 4, 1875, to February 10, 1879, when he resigned due to ill health. Chandler was elected to retake the seat twelve days later.

At age 65 Christiancy married a woman 45 years younger than him. Senator Thomas W. Ferry acted as best man. The marriage lasted only a short time before they divorced. 

He served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Peru from 1879 to 1881, after which he returned to Lansing, Michigan to resume the practice of law. During his stay in Peru, Christiancy warned the United States about the rising British influence that was being brought about by Chile during the War of the Pacific. Christiancy also wrote that Peru should be annexed for ten years and then admitted in the Union to provide the United States with access to the rich markets of South America.

He died in Lansing and is interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in Monroe.

His son, James Isaac Christiancy (1844-December 18, 1899), was First Lieutenant, United States Army. He was awarded the Medal of Honor during the American Civil War while serving in Company D, 9th Michigan Volunteer Cavalry. On May 28, 1864, while acting as aide, he voluntarily led a part of the line into the fight, and was twice wounded. The Medal was actually issued on October 10, 1892. He is buried in the Woodland Cemetery in Monroe, Michigan.

The Thomas M. Cooley Law School chapter of Phi Alpha Delta law fraternity is named for him.

<text>X is an Australian punk rock band, formed in Sydney, New South Wales in 1977 founded by Ian Rilen, Steve Lucas, Ian Krahe and Steve Cafiero. The group was formed simultaneously to, and with no knowledge of, the Los Angeles group of the same name.

==History==
===Early years===
Ian Rilen had been a founder member of the hard rock group Rose Tattoo; on leaving that band he formed X with Steve Lucas as vocalist, Ian Krahe on guitar and Steve Cafiero on drums in 1977. Krahe was renowned for playing so frenetically without a pick that his hands would bleed. Krahe died of an overdose on 20 May 1978, shortly before the group recorded its first album, &quot;X-Aspirations&quot;. Recorded in five hours at Trafalgar Studios in Sydney, the album has been listed in the book &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;. &quot;X-Aspirations&quot;, like all X studio albums, was produced by Lobby Loyde, who was also in Rose Tattoo (albeit after Rilen left: in 1979–1980). X split up shortly after the album&#x27;s 1980 release.

===Reformation===
During X&#x27;s first break from 1980 to 1983, Ian Rilen and his wife Stephanie Rilen founded the post-punk band Sardine v. Early in the 1980s, manager Nick Chance and booking agent Gerard Schlaghecke got X back together for a tour. When informed of the tour dates, Cafiero kept his promise and refused to travel to Melbourne, citing his obligations to his family and his real estate job. On short notice, Canberra-based drummer Cathy Green took Cafiero&#x27;s place for the Melbourne tour. Cafiero died in December 1988 after suffering an allergic reaction to dye injected before an X-ray for a back problem, at which time Green joined X permanently. 

The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;At Home With You&quot; (1985) was recorded in Melbourne at Richmond Recorders in March 1985. It was produced by Lobby Loyde and engineered by Tony Cohen. The recording was a signing with Major Records, run by Max Robenstone. The album stayed in Australia&#x27;s top 20 Independent charts for 29 months. A third album, &quot;X And More&quot; (1989), followed and, like the previous albums, was produced by Loyde. Although the group has not issued a studio recording since &quot;X And More&quot;, live albums from the late 1970s as well as one from 2002 have been issued between 1997 and 2004. The 2002 &quot;Evil Rumours Live At The Basement 9 December 2002&quot; features a line-up including Geoff Holmes and Cath Synnerdahl. A compilation of early unreleased material, &quot;X-Citations Best Of X And Rarities Vol 1 (The Early Years 1977 - 1983)&quot; was issued in 2017. Cath Synnerdahl died by suicide on 16 July 2004. Lucas, the only remaining member of the original line-up, continues to periodically played live under the X name, currently with bassist Kim Volkman and Hunters &amp; Collectors drummer Doug Falconer.

===Post-X===
Green (on bass) and Rilen (on bass and guitar) were both members of Hell to Pay, which released the album &quot;Steal It&quot; in 1992. Until his death in 2006, Rilen had settled on a fairly stable line-up of Ian Rilen &amp; the Love Addicts, with Green playing bass. The band issued a CD, &quot;Passion Boots &amp; Bruises&quot;. Lucas utilised Melbourne&#x27;s White Cross as a backing band to record two albums: &quot;Double Cross&quot; and &quot;Bought And Sold&quot;. Lucas also fronted Bigger Than Jesus, founded the Groody Frenzy, A.R.M. (with Chris Welsh and Mike Couvret), The Pubert Brown Fridge Occurrence, Neon and Venom and the Heinous Hounds (with Dave Hogan, Jerome Smith, Matt Dwyer and Peter Robertson). In 2004, Lucas released the solo album &quot;Bread and Water&quot; featuring cameos from Paul Kelly, Brett Kingman, Andrew Pendlebury and Chris Wilson. Green also played on albums by Loene Carmen&#x27;s group Automatic Cherry and Carmen&#x27;s solo release &quot;Slight Delay&quot;.

<doc id="631767" wikidata="Q1509317" url="?curid=631767" title="Hopesfall">
<text>Hopesfall is an American post-hardcore band from Charlotte, North Carolina, formed in 1998. They are currently signed to Equal Vision Records. The band dissolved in 2008 after all members, with the exception of singer Jay Forrest, left the band. Following this, the lineup of the band&#x27;s first two albums got together temporarily and played reunion shows in 2011. The band finally reformed with the majority of their last album&#x27;s members and original drummer Adam Morgan in 2016 with a new label Equal Vision Records. &quot;Arbiter&quot; was released on July 13, 2018.

==History==
===&quot;The Frailty of Words&quot; and &quot;No Wings to Speak Of EP&quot; (1998–2001)===
Hopesfall (stylized as &quot;.hopesfall.&quot;) began as a Christian hardcore band in 1998. They recorded their first album, &quot;The Frailty of Words&quot;, that same year, and it was released in November 1999 on Christian hardcore/punk label DTS Records. Following the release of &quot;The Frailty of Words&quot;, founding bassist Christopher Kincaid left the band, to be replaced by Pat Aldrich. In 2001, the band released the EP, &quot;No Wings to Speak Of&quot; on Takehold Records. Ryan Parrish was at the helm of songwriting during time, creating what would become known as the signature &quot;.hopesfall.&quot; sound in the melodic hardcore genre.

===&quot;The Satellite Years&quot; and exit of Ryan Parrish (2002–2004)===
2002&#x27;s &quot;The Satellite Years&quot; saw the band signed to Trustkill Records for a 3-album deal. This marked the departure of founding vocalist Doug Venable, and bassist Pat Aldrich. Jay Forrest replaced Venable on vocals. Chad Waldrup replaced Aldrich as bassist. Ryan Parrish, main songwriter, lyricist, lead guitarist, vocalist, and visionary behind the &quot;.hopesfall.&quot; trademark sound, was asked by the rest of the band to leave due to &quot;personal differences&quot; in the wake of the recording of &quot;The Satellite Years&quot;. Ryan felt disillusioned with Trustkill Records taking creative control from the band and imposing the marriage of commerce with the band&#x27;s art. This resulted in contention with the rest of the band who sided with the label, forgoing the previous vision of &quot;.hopesfall.&quot; The exit of Ryan Parrish would mark the end of the band&#x27;s trademark melodic hardcore sound, Christian message, as Ryan was the primary songwriter and spokesperson along with Venable, the two were regarded as the Christians in the band. The Satellite Years was released post Parrish&#x27;s exit, despite him having been the primary songwriter for album The Satellite Years was recorded at Great Western Record Recorders studio by Matt Talbott from HUM. The band confirmed via a Facebook story that Chad Waldrup beat Matt Talbott in the Nintendo 64 game &quot;GoldenEye&quot; which resulted in Talbott having to make good on a bet to sing vocals on, &quot;Escape Pods for Intangibles.&quot;

Ryan Parrish went on to join Nashville indie rock band Celebrity, and is currently the lead guitarist in shoegaze band In Parallel.

Mike Tyson played bass for the band on the &quot;Satellite Years&quot; tour, later joining the band as a permanent member. Chad Waldrup departed the band shortly after taking over live guitar duties, and was replaced by Dustin Nadler.

===&quot;A Types&quot; (2004–2007)===
The band followed &quot;The Satellite Years&quot; with 2004&#x27;s &quot;A Types&quot;, which had a more alternative rock sound and was a drastic stylistic departure from &quot;The Satellite Years&quot; – notably, Forrest&#x27;s vocals were almost exclusively clean singing. By the time of &quot;A Types&quot;&#x27; release, Joshua Brigham was the only remaining founding member of Hopesfall, and along with Jay Forrest, the only other remaining member from the lineup that appeared on &quot;The Satellite Years&quot;, with drummer Adam Morgan having departed weeks before recording. Morgan was replaced by Adam Baker, who departed the band during the &quot;A Types&quot; tour to be replaced by Morgan again. Morgan left the band for good prior to the recording of the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Magnetic North&quot;, and was replaced by Jason Trabue.

===&quot;Magnetic North&quot; and breakup (2007–2008)===
&quot;Magnetic North&quot; was released on May 15, 2007. The album saw the band strike a balance between the contrasting styles found on &quot;The Satellite Years&quot; and &quot;A Types&quot;. They toured little in support of &quot;Magnetic North&quot;, and in July of that year they announced further lineup changes, with Joshua Brigham, Mike Tyson, Dustin Nadler, and Jason Trabue all leaving the band. Cory Seals, Robert DeLauro, Paul Cadena, and Joey Manzione filled the vacancies, and, along with Jay Forrest, continued the US leg of the &quot;Magnetic North&quot; tour.

In September 2007, the band announced plans to change their name, thus ending the Hopesfall era; however, these plans never came to fruition. In January 2009, rumors circulated of Forrest&#x27;s intentions to record vocals for several unfinished Hopesfall songs, though no further updates were reported. Following the &quot;Magnetic North&quot; tour, the replacement members left the band, and in January 2008, Hopesfall finally announced their breakup.

===&quot;.hopesfall.&quot; reunion (2011)===
On August 5 and 6, 2011, the lineup from &quot;No Wings to Speak Of&quot; (Doug, Josh, Ryan, Adam and Pat) reunited to play shows in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Charlotte, North Carolina. They played songs from those releases as well as &quot;The Satellite Years&quot;.

===Second reunion and &quot;Arbiter&quot; (2016–present)===
The band reunited in 2016 and signed to Equal Vision Records, who re-issued their last 3 albums on vinyl. The band announced their intent to release a new album in 2017. The lineup for this new album comprises long-serving vocalist Jay Forrest, founding guitarist Josh Brigham and &quot;A-Types&quot; and &quot;Magnetic North&quot; guitarist Dustin Nadler, &quot;Satellite Years&quot; bassist Chad Waldrup, and founding drummer Adam Morgan. Hopesfall released &quot;H.A. Wallace Space Academy&quot; on April 11, 2018, the first single from the new album and the band&#x27;s first new song in 11 years. On June 12, 2018, the second single, &quot;Tunguska&quot;, was released. &quot;Arbiter&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released on July 13, 2018, through Equal Vision/Graphic Nature Records. The album was recorded and produced by Mike Watts, who also worked with the band on &quot;A Types&quot; and &quot;Magnetic North&quot;.

On May 31, 2019, the band announced the return of Ryan Parrish as lead guitarist on their Facebook page after 17 years apart.

On February 24, 2020, the band released a new song titled &quot;Hall of the Sky&quot; that was available on streaming services the following day. In addition to the band&#x27;s atmospheric post-hardcore sound, the song also features elements of progressive rock and post-rock. The song is the first Hopesfall recording with Parrish since 2002&#x27;s &quot;The Satellite Years&quot;.

In March 2020, the band had planned to embark on a tour across Japan with Taken. The tour was supposed to begin on March 25 in Tokyo, but it was later announced that the tour would be postponed due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 2, 2022 the band announced the postponed tour of Japan was back on again.

==Relationship with Trustkill==

The band&#x27;s relationship with Trustkill was always adversarial; the label altered the track listing for &quot;Magnetic North&quot; without the band&#x27;s knowledge, and in an interview in the wake of the band&#x27;s breakup, former drummer Jason Trabue accused the label of providing the band with insufficient promotion and financial support throughout their tenure on Trustkill, as well as withholding royalties. In response to the MySpace bulletin announcing the band&#x27;s breakup and revealing their distaste for their former label, as well as the interview with Trabue, Trustkill founder Josh Grabelle denied the accusations and leveled his own unsubstantiated allegations of drug use by the band as a cause for the breakup.

==Musical style and influences==
The band&#x27;s musical style has changed over the course of its career, but has primarily been described as post-hardcore, melodic hardcore, alternative rock, and space rock. The band was originally described as Christian hardcore on the debut &quot;Frailty of Words&quot;. The albums &quot;No Wings to Speak Of&quot; and &quot;The Satellite Years&quot; have also been described as metalcore.

The band&#x27;s influences are very diverse. The band is influenced by emo bands such as Cursive, Karate, and The Appleseed Cast; alternative rock bands such as HUM and Jawbox; and hardcore punk bands such as Strongarm, Bloodshed, Shai Hulud, and Overcome.

<doc id="631772" wikidata="Q613460" url="?curid=631772" title="Eliza Manningham-Buller">
<text>Elizabeth Lydia Manningham-Buller, Baroness Manningham-Buller (born 14 July 1948) is a retired British intelligence officer. She worked as a teacher for three years before joining MI5, the British internal Security Service. She led the newly created Irish counter-terrorism section from 1992 and then became director in charge of surveillance and technical operations. She became Director General of MI5 in October 2002 and, in that capacity, led the Security Service&#x27;s response to the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Following her retirement in April 2007, she became a crossbench life peer in 2008.

She became chair of the Conduct Committee, which is a select committee of the House of Lords, on 19 January 2022. As of 2020, she is listed as #86 in &quot;Forbes&quot; list of the World&#x27;s 100 Most Powerful Women. She was appointed Chancellor of the Order of the Garter by King Charles III in June 2024, becoming the first woman to hold the position.

==Professional life==
Lady Manningham-Buller worked as a teacher for three years at Queen&#x27;s Gate School, Kensington, London from 1971 to 1974, having read English at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, before joining the Security Service. She was recruited to the Security Service at a drinks party when someone suggested that she see someone at the Ministry of Defence. Specializing in counter-terrorism rather than MI5&#x27;s then-classical counter-espionage, she was active at the time of the Lockerbie bombing by Libya in 1988. During the early 1980s she was reportedly one of only five people aware that Oleg Gordievsky, the deputy head of the KGB at the Soviet embassy in London, was actually a double agent.

She was a senior liaison officer working out of Washington, D.C. to the US intelligence community over the period of the first Gulf War, before leading the newly created Irish counter-terrorism section from 1992 when MI5 were given the lead responsibility for such work (from the Metropolitan Police). Having been promoted to the management board of the Security Service the next year, Manningham-Buller became the director in charge of surveillance and technical operations. She was appointed Deputy Director General in 1997, and succeeded Sir Stephen Lander as Director General in 2002, the second woman to take on the role after Dame Stella Rimington.

In the 2005 Birthday Honours, Manningham-Buller was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the Bath (DCB). She resigned from MI5 on 21 April 2007, and was succeeded by her deputy, Jonathan Evans. She was raised to the peerage as Baroness Manningham-Buller, &quot;of Northampton in the County of Northamptonshire&quot; on 2 June 2008.

She reportedly joined the public speaking circuit. She was appointed to the Court and Council of Imperial College London in 2009, becoming deputy chairman later that year, and named chairman in July 2011. She became a governor of biomedical research charity the Wellcome Trust in 2008 and the first female chair of the Trust on 1 October 2015. She left the Wellcome Trust in 2021, being replaced as chair by Julia Gillard on 12 April 2021. Since 2015, she has been the co-president of Chatham House.
On St George&#x27;s Day (23 April), 2014, Lady Manningham-Buller was appointed a Lady Companion of the Order of the Garter (LG) by Queen Elizabeth II.

She became chair of the Conduct Committee on 19 January 2022. She took part in the Royal Procession at the Coronation of Charles III and Camilla, carrying St Edward&#x27;s Staff.

==Personal life==
Lady Manningham-Buller was the second daughter in a family of four, born to Reginald Manningham-Buller, 1st Viscount Dilhorne, and his wife, the former Lady Mary Lindsay. Manningham-Buller&#x27;s father, Lord Dilhorne (1905–1980), was a Conservative MP from 1943 to 1962. He was Britain&#x27;s second highest legal officer, the Solicitor General. He later held the office of Lord Chancellor for two years. He was created an hereditary peer with the title Viscount Dilhorne. Her mother, Lady Dilhorne, trained carrier pigeons that were used to fly coded messages in World War II. The pigeons were dropped in wicker baskets with little parachutes over France and Germany and they were used to fly back to her mother&#x27;s pigeon loft carrying intelligence. One of the pigeons won the Dickin Medal, and one brought back intelligence of the V-2 rocket project in Peenemünde, Germany. Lady Dilhorne died in Oxfordshire on 25 March 2004, aged 93.

Manningham-Buller was educated at Northampton High School and Benenden School.

On 15 July 1991, she married David John Mallock and has five stepchildren by her husband&#x27;s prior marriage.

==Public statements==

===Backing the War on Terror===
Manningham-Buller has made speeches to invited audiences containing members of the press, as well as making court statements. On 17 June 2003, at a conference at the Royal United Services Institute she gave her complete backing for the War on Terror and said that renegade scientists had given terror groups information needed to create chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weapons. She also warned that the threat from international terrorism would be &quot;with us for a good long time&quot;, which was why new legislation had been introduced.

===Speech on 7 July 2005 London bombings===
On 10 September 2005, she spoke to an audience in the Netherlands about the 7 July 2005 London bombings and her disappointment that MI5 failed to stop attacks, even when in possession of intelligence, because of bureaucratic inertia. She added that &quot;[the] world has changed and there needs to be a debate on whether some erosion of [the] civil liberties we all value may be necessary to improve the chances of our citizens not being blown apart as they go about their daily lives.&quot;

===Stance on gaining intelligence through torture===
On 21 October 2005, BBC News reported Manningham-Buller&#x27;s leaked court statement to the Law Lords regarding methods for collecting intelligence from overseas. This was part of an investigation by the Law Lords on whether Her Majesty&#x27;s Government should have to be made aware whether the intelligence it is using was obtained through torture. &quot;Experience proves that detainee reporting can be accurate and may enable lives to be saved&quot;, she stated, also maintaining that obtaining information from foreign intelligence agencies, which initially enters the British intelligence system via MI6, was vital in fighting terrorism. Regarding the ethics of how and where this intelligence is gathered she stated that &quot;agencies will not often know the location or details of detention&quot;.

Her example to support the need for intelligence gathering from overseas was the case of Mohammed Megeurba, an Algerian man who was questioned by agencies in his country. Evidence collected by this questioning led to a raid in London which led to the Wood Green ricin plot being uncovered. Press have speculated that Megeurba was tortured to obtain this information, although Manningham-Buller has maintained neither she nor MI5 were aware of the &quot;precise circumstances that attended their [Algerian agencies&#x27;] questioning of Megeurba&quot;. She emphasised that, had MI5 requested information regarding how the intelligence had been gathered, its request would have been ignored and the relationship between Britain and Algeria could have been damaged. She concluded by exemplifying the &quot;importance of co-operation between states in countering the threat from international terrorism&quot;. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights organisation Liberty, commended Manningham-Buller for being &quot;brutally honest&quot; about the activities of intelligence agencies. She also stated that Britain should not &quot;legitimise&quot; torture as a means of intelligence gathering by accepting evidence gained in such a manner as evidence in court. Manningham-Buller stated that the British intelligence services do not ask how intelligence is obtained &quot;because that would make things difficult&quot;.

===Refusal to appear before the Joint Committee on Human Rights===
On 23 January 2006, she refused to appear before the Joint Committee on Human Rights in Parliament to speak about &quot;the extent to which the Service is, or could take steps to ensure it is, aware that information it receives from foreign agencies may have been obtained by the use of torture&quot;, and &quot;any information which the Service may have about extraordinary renditions using UK airports&quot;.

===Speech on MI5 after the September 11 attacks===
On 9 November 2006, Manningham-Buller gave a speech to the Mile End Group at Queen Mary, University of London as a guest of Professor Peter Hennessy in which she warned that her office was tracking 30 terror plots, and 200 groupings or networks, totalling over 1,600 individuals. She stated that MI5 had expanded by 50% since the September 11 attacks and stood at roughly 2,800 staff. She reiterated her warning that the threat &quot;may — I suggest will — include the use of chemicals, bacteriological agents, radioactive materials and even nuclear technology&quot;.

This speech came three days after Dhiren Barot was sentenced to 40 years for his part in the 2004 Financial buildings plot in which he had a plan to build a radiological dirty bomb that involved setting fire to 10,000 smoke alarms. In September 2011 Eliza Manningham-Buller delivered one of the BBC Radio Reith Lectures and answered questions from an audience that included historian Peter Hennessy and novelist Ian McEwan.

===Attack on 42-day terrorism detention===
On 8 July 2008, Baroness Manningham-Buller made her maiden speech in the House of Lords since her resignation. She told the House that she was against government plans to extend the time period for retaining terrorist suspects in the UK from 28 to 42 days. She told peers that she disagreed on a &quot;practical basis as well as a principled one&quot;. She criticised the plans for terrorism detention as being not &quot;in any way workable&quot; and emphasised the need for all political parties to work together in finding a solution for dealing with terrorism. Furthermore, Lady Manningham-Buller maintained that &quot;complete security&quot; could never be achieved in a country and that civil liberties were at risk of being compromised if the plans were passed by the House of Lords.

The speech, only 501 words long and lasting only four minutes, attracted praise from other Lords, including Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale, who described it as &quot;outstanding, thoughtful and valuable&quot;, but also significant attention in the media, given the Baroness&#x27;s expertise in counter-terrorism issues. Martin Kettle, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 11 July 2008, described it as &quot;devastatingly succinct&quot; and &quot;the fatal shot&quot; which would ensure that the Government&#x27;s &quot;plans were holed below the water line&quot;. James Kirkup of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described it as &quot;a huge blow to Gordon Brown&#x27;s plans to extend the detention of terrorist suspects to 42 days&quot;.

Other peers supported Lady Manningham-Buller&#x27;s stance against the plans, including former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith, former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer and former Chairperson of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), Lady Neville-Jones. Nevertheless, Lord West of Spithead, who was First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy until 2006 and was then a junior Home Office minister spoke for the Government and implied that more stringent security measures were required to deal with the &quot;unprecedented terrorist threat&quot; to the UK.

===Lecture on torture in the House of Lords (9 March 2010)===
Giving a lecture in the House of Lords, Baroness Manningham-Buller said &quot;the government did lodge protests&quot; to its US counterparts once the extent of torture was known. It is the first time that has been said publicly. Asked if she had known of the use of waterboarding and other techniques of pressure while she was Director General of MI5, from October 2002 until her retirement in April 2007, she said she had done, and had disapproved. &quot;Nothing – not even the saving of lives – justifies torturing people ... the Americans were very keen to conceal from us what they were doing [with suspects]&quot;.

===2010 Iraq inquiry comments===
Baroness Manningham-Buller giving evidence to the Iraq inquiry in July 2010 said the decision to go to war meant that &quot;Our involvement in Iraq, for want of a better word, radicalised a whole generation of young people, some of them British citizens who saw our involvement in Iraq, on top of our involvement in Afghanistan, as being an attack on Islam,&quot; she said, before immediately correcting herself by adding &quot;not a whole generation, a few among a generation&quot;. As a result, she said she was not &quot;surprised&quot; that UK nationals were involved in the 7 July 2005 bombings in central London. She said she believed the intelligence on Iraq&#x27;s threat was not &quot;substantial enough&quot; to justify the action. A year after the invasion, she said MI5 was &quot;swamped&quot; by leads about terrorist threats to the UK.

==&quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;==
Manningham-Buller was a castaway on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in November 2007 giving her first interview after her retirement. She talked briefly about her personal life and her former professional life, including her reactions to the 7 July 2005 London bombings and the importance of protecting their agents. She explained that she had decided on her retirement date shortly after she took up the Director General job, choosing to retire with a total of 33 years&#x27; service in the security services. She chose an anthology of poems edited by Ted Hughes and Seamus Heaney, entitled &quot;The Rattle Bag&quot;.

==&quot;The BBC Reith Lectures&quot;==
In June 2011, the BBC announced Eliza Manningham-Buller would present the 2011 Reith Lectures, alongside the Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a series entitled &quot;Securing Freedom&quot;. Eliza Manningham-Buller&#x27;s lectures broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service in September 2011.

In her first lecture, titled &quot;Terror&quot;, recorded at BBC Broadcasting House in London, she reflected on the lasting significance of 11 September 2001, asking was it a terrorist crime, an act of war, or something different. She also revealed details of her own role in the discussions involving international security agencies in the days following the attacks on New York and Washington DC and examined the impact the US-led invasion of Iraq had on the fight against al-Qaeda.

In her second lecture, titled &quot;Security&quot;, recorded at the Leeds City Museum, she stated that the use of torture is &quot;wrong and never justified&quot; and should be &quot;utterly rejected even when it may offer the prospect of saving lives&quot;. She said that the use of torture had not made the world a safer place, adding that the use of water-boarding by the United States was a &quot;profound mistake&quot; and as a result America lost its &quot;moral authority&quot;.

In her third and final lecture, titled &quot;Freedom&quot;, recorded at the British Library in London, she discussed foreign policy priorities since the September 11 attacks. She stated that it was &quot;necessary&quot; to talk to dictators and terrorists, to protect security and said that the British government&#x27;s decision to engage with Colonel Gaddafi in 2003 was &quot;the right decision&quot;. She went on to say that protecting British citizens would be impossible if the security services were restricted to talking only to those with shared values and cited examples where people once deemed terrorists were now part of the political establishment: &quot;Look at Northern Ireland, where former terrorists are in government... look at Mandela and the ANC which used terror tactics when it was in exile.&quot; During the recording of the final lecture she revealed that she had suffered an anxiety dream, in which she imagined that she was to be arrested for breaking the Official Secrets Act after having given the lectures.

<doc id="631788" wikidata="Q495152" url="?curid=631788" title="Kirribilli, New South Wales">
<text>Kirribilli is a suburb of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. One of the city&#x27;s most established and affluent neighbourhoods, it is located three kilometres north of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area administered by North Sydney Council. Kirribilli is a harbourside suburb, sitting on the Lower North Shore of Sydney Harbour. Kirribilli House is one of the two official residences of the Prime Minister of Australia.

==History==

The name Kirribilli is derived from an Aboriginal word &quot;Kiarabilli&quot;, which means &#x27;good fishing spot&#x27;. Another theory suggests that Kirribilli is an adaptation of &#x27;Carabella&#x27;, the name given by early colonist James Milson to his first house.

The suburb initially formed in the vicinity of Jeffrey Street and was subsequently part of a grant to James Milson, after whom Milsons Point was named. The area was largely covered in native bush. As the decades passed, the land was cleared bit by bit and sub-divided, first for the construction of large family residences during the 1840s, secondly for the erection of Victorian terrace houses from the 1860s onwards, and finally for 20th-Century flats.

Prominent early landowners in Kirribilli included members of the Campbell, Jeffrey and Gibbes families. Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), the Collector of Customs for New South Wales, built &#x27;Wotonga&#x27; - the forerunner of Admiralty House - in 1842–43 on a site which he leased, and then purchased, from the Campbells. Gibbes&#x27; son, William John Gibbes, lived nearby in Beulah House during the 1840s. Beulah was later lived in by the Riley and Lasseter families. Eventually, the house was demolished and its grounds subdivided into numerous residential blocks which were put up for public auction in 1905.

Although Kirribilli is a predominantly residential area today, from 1890 to 1921, the Pastoral Finance Association had a large wool warehouse, meat cold store and wharf, on the foreshore adjacent to Admiralty House. The seven-storey building was destroyed by fire in December 1921, along with 30,000 bales of wool. Its engine room, which survived the fire, supplied electricity to customers on the north side of the harbour, until around 1922. The land was sold off in 19 allotments, in 1925, and later redeveloped as blocks of apartments.

The Kirribilli area opened up further for development with the completion of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, which linked the municipality of North Sydney directly by road and rail with the CBD of the City of Sydney.

Kirribilli experienced significant changes after World War II. In the early 1950s, it saw a growing population and an increase in demand for housing and infrastructure in Sydney&#x27;s suburbs. Residential development strengthened during its period, with older houses being replaced by modern apartment blocks and townhouses. The development was part of the wider trend of urbanisation in Sydney, where urban dwellers moved into the suburbs for more space.

Today Kirribilli is a modern suburb, with stunning views of Sydney Harbour, including its world-heritage listed opera house and skyline of the Sydney CBD.

==Population==
In the 2021 Census, there were 3,629 people in Kirribilli. 53.7% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 6.3% and China 3.1%. 72.3% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.0% and Catholic 21.5%. While the suburb is one of the more densely populated parts of Sydney, as of 2024 it was reported to have a very high number of inactive dwellings.

==Landmarks==

Kirribilli is one of Australia&#x27;s older suburbs, with the first land grants in the area being granted by the colonial government during the 1790s. A scattering of Georgian and Gothic-revival houses and mansions were built in the 1830s, &#x27;40s and &#x27;50s. Most of these have since been razed. Originally, Kirribilli formed part of the Parish of St Leonard&#x27;s and was served by a private ferry service. In a process which began in the 1860s, the area&#x27;s old estates were subdivided. New residential streets were laid out and terrace houses, Victorian villas and, later, blocks of apartments erected. During the early decades of the 20th century, Kirribilli&#x27;s shoreline was dominated by a large, multi-storey brick warehouse which was eventually torn down to make way for housing.

The suburb contains Kirribilli House (the official Sydney residence of the Prime Minister of Australia), Admiralty House (the official Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia), and the headquarters and marina of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron located on the former Carabella mansion. The Sydney headquarters of ASIO was formerly at 31 Carabella Street. The Sydney Flying Squadron is located adjoining Milson Park, formerly Kirribilli Park.

Admiralty House, originally a private dwelling belonging to Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes, is Kirribilli&#x27;s oldest extant building, the earliest portions of which date to 1842. Kirribilli House was built next door by Adolphus Frederick Feez, a wealthy merchant, in 1854–55.

The following buildings are on the Register of the National Estate:
* St Aloysius&#x27; College, Upper Pitt Street
* St Aloysius&#x27; College&#x27;s junior school (formerly Kirribilli Public School), Burton Street
* Loreto Convent (formerly Elamang), Carabella Street
* Kirribilli Neighbourhood Centre, Fitzroy Street
* Sunnyside (house and grounds), Holbrook Avenue
* Kirribilli House, Kirribilli Avenue
* Admiralty House and Lodge, Kirribilli Point

==Transport==
Kirribilli supports the northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Warringah Freeway provides a link south to the Sydney CBD and north to Chatswood. Kirribilli is serviced by rail, bus and ferry services.

Milsons Point railway station is the closest railway station on the North Shore railway line of the Sydney Trains network. It is located next to the main shopping streets, and has frequent services to the Sydney CBD and the North Shore.

Busways operate regular services from Kirribilli to many parts of northern Sydney. The 269 bus service runs a loop within the Kirribilli - Milsons Point - McMahons Point - North Sydney railway station area on weekdays.

There are four operating ferry wharves near Kirribilli, serviced by both public and private ferries. They are:

* On the eastern side is Kirribilli wharf, part of the Sydney Ferries Neutral Bay service. The wharf is one stop from Circular Quay and has two services per hour in each direction. Kirribilli Wharf also has a small local cafe serving coffees, cakes, and newspapers to commuters and many local regulars.
* At the southernmost tip of Kirribilli is the Beulah Street Wharf. This small wharf was dropped from public Sydney Ferries services when an inner harbour ferry route was cancelled, though was briefly pressed into service between 7–13 February 2011 and again on 27–28 October 2012 while the main Kirribilli wharf was undergoing maintenance. In 2005, private operator Matilda Cruises started using Beulah Street Wharf as part of their Matilda Express loop from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour but it was suspended by 2006. Outside ferry hours, Beulah Street Wharf is frequently used for fishing and recreation and being directly north of the Sydney Opera House, offers spectacular harbour views.
* On the eastern side of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Jeffreys Street Wharf is also no longer used by Sydney Ferries, with just a few services by Matilda Cruises. It is still used by private charter services, but is more popular as a fishing location. The panoramic views of the Opera House, Circular Quay, and the Harbour Bridge make Jeffrey Street a popular location for wedding photography. 
* On the western side of the Bridge is Milsons Point ferry wharf, which carries many more services than the Kirribilli wharves and joins Kirribilli to the CBD, the inner harbour, and along the Parramatta River to Parramatta.

==Commercial area==

Kirribilli has a small shopping strip opposite Milsons Point railway station. The &#x27;Kirribilli Markets&#x27; are held on the fourth Saturday of each month, on the lawns of the former Kirribilli Bowling Club. The markets contain a mixture of new and second-hand clothing, bric-a-brac, jewellery, and food-and-drink stands.

==Schools==
The two main schools in the suburb are St Aloysius&#x27; College and Loreto Kirribilli.

==Churches==
* Our Lady Star of the Sea Catholic Church, part of North Sydney Parish
* St John&#x27;s Anglican Church (&quot;Church by the Bridge&quot;)

==Culture==
Kirribilli is the home of Australia&#x27;s oldest continuously operating professional theatre company, The Ensemble Theatre. Located in a converted boatshed, it shows productions of contemporary works by both Australian and International playwrights.

== People ==
* Elizabeth von Arnim (1866–1941), German-British novelist
