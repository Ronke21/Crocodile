<text>The Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, formerly the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, is the oldest natural science research institution and museum in the Americas. It was founded in 1812, by many of the leading naturalists of the young American republic with an expressed mission of &quot;the encouragement and cultivation of the sciences&quot;. It has sponsored expeditions, conducted original environmental and systematics research, and amassed natural history collections containing more than 17 million specimens. The Academy also organizes public exhibits and educational programs for both schools and the general public.

==History==

During the first decades of the United States, Philadelphia was the cultural capital and one of the country&#x27;s commercial centers. Two of the city&#x27;s institutions, the Library Company and the American Philosophical Society, were centers of enlightened thought and scientific inquiry.

The increasing sophistication of the earth and life sciences, combined with a growing awareness of the variety of life and landscape in the American wilderness that has not been discovered, led a small group of naturalists to establish the Academy of Natural Sciences in the winter of 1812. The academy was meant to foster a gathering of fellow naturalists, and nurture the growth and credibility of American science. They frequently looked to their European counterparts for inspiration and expertise and longed to be regarded as equals. On 25 April 1817 they were incorporated into the society under the title of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia by the legislature of Pennsylvania. By 1 January 1818, eight members were published.

In 2011, the Academy became affiliated with nearby Drexel University and changed its name to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University.

=== Notable members ===
Within a decade of its founding, the Academy became the undisputed center of natural sciences in the United States. Academy members were frequently enlisted to participate in national surveys of the western territories and other major expeditions. Several of its earliest members, including William Bartram, John Godman, Richard Harlan, Angelo Heilprin, Charles Alexandre Lesueur, William Maclure, Titian Peale, Charles Pickering, Thomas Say, and Alexander Wilson were among the pioneers or recognized authorities in their respective areas of study. Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, John Edwards Holbrook of South Carolina, Thomas Nuttall and Richard Owen of the United Kingdom, Georges Cuvier of France, and Alexander von Humboldt of Prussia were among the corresponding members (members who lived far from Philadelphia) of the Academy&#x27;s first decades.

Later during the 19th century, other notable naturalists and scientists, including John James Audubon, Charles S. Boyer, John Cassin, Edward Drinker Cope, Ezra Townsend Cresson, Richard Harlan, Ferdinand V. Hayden, Isaac Lea, William W. Jefferis, John Lawrence LeConte, Joseph Leidy, Samuel George Morton, George Ord, and James Rehn were members. Corresponding members included Charles Darwin along with his supporters Asa Gray, and Thomas Henry Huxley.

For much of its history, new members had to be nominated by two current members and then elected by the remaining members. These requirements were dropped in 1924. Notable 20th-century scientists include James Böhlke, James Bond, Henry Weed Fowler, Ruth Patrick, Henry Pilsbry, H. Radclyffe Roberts, and Witmer Stone.

==Collections and research==

The Academy of Natural Sciences holds an internationally important natural history collection. Currently, there are over 18 million biological specimens, and hundreds of thousands of volumes, journals, illustrations, photographs, and archival items in its library. These collections were obtained through multiple means, including the donation or purchase of existing collections or individual items, the collection activities of Academy-sponsored expeditions, or those of individual scientists, whether or not they work at the Academy. Some collections were originally gathered by other institutions. For example, a number of the natural history collections at the American Philosophical Society were relocated to the Academy by the end of the 19th century.

Traditionally, researchers at natural science (or natural history) institutions such as the Academy engaged in biological taxonomy, the science of discovering, describing, naming, and classifying species. In recent decades, research has shifted in emphasis to the science of systematics, the study of the evolutionary relationships among these species. The Academy preserves many type specimens, the reference material that helps establish a species&#x27; identity. They also preserve additional specimens with which scientists can investigate the nature of these species, their relationships with other species, their evolutionary history, or their conservation status.

===Museum collections and research programs===
The Academy&#x27;s collections include a wide range of specimens across the tree of life. The museum also maintains several historically important collections.

====Botany====
Botany is study of plants, including nonvascular bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, and hornworts) and vascular plants, including ferns, conifers and flowering plants. The field of botany has also traditionally included the study of algae, lichens, and fungi which are now classified in different biological kingdoms. Collections at the Academy, which are housed in the Philadelphia Herbarium (PH), the oldest institutional herbarium in the New World, include some of the oldest and most important botanical collections in the Americas. Notable early collectors include Benjamin Smith Barton, Constatine Rafinesque, Thomas Meehan, Thomas Nuttall, and Fredrick Pursh.

The herbarium contains approximately 1.5 million specimens of vascular plants, fungi, lichens, algae, and fossil plants, 40,000 of which are types. It also contains some special collections, including the plants collected by Johann and Georg Forster during the voyages of Captain James Cook, and by Meriwether Lewis during the Lewis and Clark expedition (Corps of Discovery). The department&#x27;s current focus is plant biodiversity and evolution focusing on Apocynaceae (milkweed or dogbane family) and Polygalaceae.

====Diatoms====
The Academy&#x27;s Diatom Herbarium, the largest in the Americas and the second largest in the world, contains approximately 220,000 slides of these microscopic algae. The herbarium contains many specimens contributed by notable collectors, a diversity of fossil diatoms, and diatoms collected as part of numerous freshwater environmental surveys in the United States. The Diatom Herbarium also provides collections and taxonomic services for the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Former curators of note include Charles S. Boyer, Ruth Patrick, and Charles Reimer.

====Entomology====
Entomology has been important to the Academy since its founding. Two of its earliest members include Thomas Say, regarded as the father of American entomology, and Titian Peale, a leading natural history illustrator and the chief naturalist on the United States Exploring Expedition (1834–1842). The entomology collection currently contains more than 3.5 million specimens and includes the Titian Peale Moth and Butterfly Collection, the oldest entomology collection in the United States. Curator Emeritus, Daniel Otte, an expert on Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers, and their relatives) is a pioneer of presenting biological data on the internet through the creation of the Orthoptera Species File. Curator and Entomology Department Chair, Jon Gelhaus is a leading expert on crane flies and manages the Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey.

====Ichthyology====
Ichthyology has also been a part of Academy collections and research since its beginnings, but the size of the collection was relatively modest until acquisition of Edward Drinker Cope&#x27;s personal collections in 1898. A few years later, Henry Weed Fowler began his tenure at the Academy, during which he systematized the collections and described 1,408 species. James E. Böhlke, William Saul, and William Smith-Vaniz are among the scientists who followed Fowler. Curator Emeritus, John Lundberg, an expert in catfishes, pioneered deep channel collecting in large tropical rivers and is the lead author of a seminal scientific paper on the biological and geographic history of the Amazon River Basin. The Ichthyology collection, which currently houses nearly 1.2 million specimens and nearly 3,000 types, is one of the most important such collections in the United States. The department also hosts the All Catfish Species Inventory (a comprehensive online resource on catfish) and Catfish Bones (an online digital atlas of catfish morphology), and is a participant in Neodat II (an online resource of Neotropic ichthyology collections).

====Malacology====
Two of the early members of the Academy, Thomas Say and Isaac Lea, were malacologists (see also conchologists). R. Tucker Abbott, Samuel Stehman Haldeman, Henry A. Pilsbry, and George W. Tryon, Jr. were other noted malacologists who worked at the Academy. The Academy&#x27;s malacology collection is the oldest such collection in the United States and is the 3rd largest in the world. It currently contains over 10 million specimens, including types erected by more than 400 authors. Curator Gary Rosenberg, an expert on Jamaican land snails, is a leader in digitised museum collections and research data. Research websites include the Malacology Georeferencing Project an online database of Western Atlantic Marine Mollusca (Malacolog), and the OBIS Indo-Pacific Mollusc database. Research associate and former curator Danielle Graf, an expert on Unionidae (freshwater mussels), maintains the MUSSEL Project web site.

====Ornithology====
The majority of ornithologists active in the United States during the first half of the 19th century, including Charles Lucien Bonaparte, George Ord, Titian Ramsay Peale, John James Audubon, John Cassin, Thomas Nuttall, and John Kirk Townsend, were active members of the Academy. Later notable Academy ornithologists include James Bond, Frank Gill, Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee, Pete Myers, Fred Sheldon, and Witmer Stone. With nearly 200,000 specimens representing over 9,000 species, the Ornithology collection is one of the largest and most taxonomically complete bird collections in the world. The Delaware Valley Ornithological Club (DVOC) has held regular meetings at the Academy since 1890.

====Vertebrate paleontology====

Vertebrate paleontology in the United States originated in Philadelphia through the efforts of naturalists and scientists associated with the American Philosophical Society (APS) during the first decade of the 19th century and at The Academy of Natural Sciences thereafter. By the end of the 19th century, the holdings from the APS, including the Thomas Jefferson Fossil Collection, had been transferred to the Academy for safekeeping. Currently, the collection contains more than 22,000 specimens, including many types. Richard Harlan was an early member who introduced many American naturalists to the groundbreaking works of Georges Cuvier. Joseph Leidy, who described &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; and alerted the scientific world to the paleontological treasures of the American West, is considered the &quot;father&quot; of American vertebrate paleontology. Edward Drinker Cope, who also worked extensively on other vertebrates, is best known for his rivalry with Othniel Charles Marsh during the infamous Bone Wars. Curator Edward B. Daeschler is currently studying the evolution of Devonian tetrapods, but he will be retiring in September 2023. He is a co-discoverer of the transitional &quot;fishapod&quot; &quot;Tiktaalik roseae&quot; from the Canadian Arctic and the discoverer of two tetrapods, &quot;Hynerpeton&quot; and &quot;Densignathus&quot; from the Catskill Formation in Pennsylvania.

====Other collections====
The Academy houses several collections of smaller size yet historical and scientific importance. The general invertebrate collection contains about 22,600 specimens, while the invertebrate paleontology collection contains about 105,000 lots. Both contain numerous type specimens. Generally, 21,500 specimens are gaunt, 13,500 are affiliated skins, and 1,700 are wet-preserved specimens. The Frank J. Myers Rotifer Collection is the most comprehensive collection of rotifers on microslides. The herpetology collection contains about 40,000 specimens, including more than 500 type specimens. The mammalogy collection contains about 36,000 specimens and 180 holotypes. Among the naturalists and scientists associated with these collections are Timothy Conrad, Edward Drinker Cope, Richard Harlan, John Edwards Holbrook, William W. Jefferis, Henry Charles Lea, Isaac Lea, Joseph Leidy, Samuel George Morton, and Thomas Say.

===Patrick Center for Environmental Research===
Formerly the Limnology Department, the Patrick Center for Environmental Research focuses on applied ecology. Founded in 1947 by Ruth Patrick, formerly of the Diatom Herbarium, it was one of the earliest U.S. environmental consulting concerns. Its attachment to the Academy led it to become the first to employ interdisciplinary teams of scientists to study freshwater systems and the first to regard biodiversity as a central criterion of water quality.

Its 1948 biological survey of the Conestoga River Basin in Pennsylvania, a milestone in environmental research, led to similar surveys and studies throughout much of the United States. Characteristically, these earlier projects were joint projects of the Limnology Department and private industry. Since the rise of the environmental movement in the 1960s and 1970s and the resulting increases in governmental regulation of water pollution, the environmental assessments pioneered at the Academy are increasingly conducted by private environmental consulting firms.

, much of the research at the Patrick Center is conducted with regulatory agencies and other governmental bodies, in fields such as diatom autecology, environmental chemistry and toxicology, habitat restoration, long-term environmental trends, species conservation, and watershed management. Some of the work employs most of the center&#x27;s expertise and capabilities, such as recent studies on the ecological effects of small dams or the ecological benefits of riparian reforestation.

Other studies may involve only one or a couple of the research programs. For example, a current project sampling sediment cores in tidal marshes throughout the Delaware Estuary. This undertaking, possibly the most comprehensive core sampling in any estuary, relies extensively on the center&#x27;s expertise in biogeochemistry and phycology. Once the sampling is completed, scientist will be able to investigate historical trends in marsh development, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, water pollution, salinity variations, and climatic change by analysing the core&#x27;s sediments, chemistry, and diatom assemblages.

====Biogeochemistry====
The Biogeochemistry Section of the Patrick Center is concerned with the influence of aquatic organisms on the sources, fate and transport of chemicals in aquatic systems. Studies frequently deal with the carbon and nutrient cycling as well as those of trace elements (e.g., lead, copper, mercury, and zinc) and organic contaminants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The section regularly provides water, sediment and tissue analyses for government, intergovernmental agencies, and private companies from around the country. In addition to the sediment core project mentioned above, it has recently studied the effects of small dams on sediment contaminants, photochemical transformation of marsh-derived dissolved organic matter, and sedimentation and eutrophication in salt marshes.

====Ecological Modeling====
The Ecological Modeling Section employs sophisticated and rigorous mathematical modelling techniques to address a variety of questions in basic and applied research. Examples include watershed-scale modeling and risk assessment; nonlinear population models structured by age, body size, or space; particle transport in turbulent aquatic systems; and the ecology and control of exotic invasive plants in urban parks.

====Fisheries====
The Fisheries Section of the Patrick Center conducts research into the ecology, conservation, and management of lotic and estuarine fishes. Studies may range from the analysis of fish tissues for contaminants, monitoring fish populations for environmental assessments, to investigating the life histories of individual species. Recent and ongoing work include, glass eel (the larvae of freshwater or American eels) recruitment in the Delaware River basin, the ecology and genetics of bridal shiner (a fish that&#x27;s endangered in Pennsylvania), and the impacts of flow management (dam releases) in the Upper Delaware River to native and introduced fish populations.

====Macroinvertebrates====
Benthic macroinvertebrates (primarily aquatic insects, crustaceans, and mollusks) are useful for biological monitoring programs. Their varied life spans, ranging from weeks to years, are long enough to reveal intermittent and continuous pollutants, yet short enough respond to worsening or improving water quality. The Macroinvertebrate Section at the Patrick Center has extensive experience in bioassessment, biomonitoring, and inventorying of freshwater habitats throughout the United States.

====Phycology====
Because of their great diversity and specific ecological requirements, algae, particularly diatoms, make excellent indicators of water quality. Moreover, diatoms are readily preserved in sediments, which make them useful organisms for studying paleolimnology (the long-term trends of streams and lakes). The Phycology Section of the Patrick Center provides algal analyses for governmental and other agencies interested in both assessing water quality and long-term environmental trends. One such undertaking is the analyses of diatom assemblages in lake sediments (sediment cores) throughout the eastern United States. This work, part of a large project managed by the EPA, will try to establish reference (pre-anthropogenic) conditions for lakes throughout the country.

In addition to these research efforts, the Phycology Section of the Patrick Center has developed a set of online resources for using algae in environmental research. These include an algal image database, autecology datasets for freshwater algae, algae research with the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program, and a diatom paleolimnology database.

===Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology===
For most of its history, biological taxonomy and systematics were conducted using comparative morphology. In recent decades, however, advances in molecular biology and computational technologies have opened new possibilities for studying the diversity and history of life through the use of cladistics and computational phylogenetics. These technologies also offer new opportunities for molecular ecology and conservation genetics.

Academy scientists have been early adapters of molecular biology techniques. Allozymes, DNA-DNA hybridization, immunoelectrophoresis, restriction site analyses of mitochondrial DNA and serology were used extensively since the late 1960s. Recent molecular work mainly employs DNA sequencing, microsatellites, and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism). In 2004, the Laboratory for Molecular Systematics and Ecology (LMSE) was formed as a shared, multi-user facility to improve access to and provide training for the use of molecular data in systematic and ecological research. In addition to supporting staff, the lab offers research opportunities for students and post-doctoral fellowships.

====Hovsgol====
The Academy&#x27;s work in Mongolia started with the realization of the unique research opportunities available at Lake Hovsgol (Hovsgol Nuur). This large lake and its watershed were remarkably pristine and relatively unknown, especially in comparison to its sister lake in Russia, Lake Baikal. In 1995, a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the Academy, as well as from other American institutions, Mongolia, Russia, and Japan started a multi-year study of the lake&#x27;s biodiversity, limnology, and watershed.

Although this research was scientifically rewarding, it was apparent that issues concerning environmental protection and sustainable economic development needed addressing. Consequently, work at Hovsgol shifted to ecosystem studies and capacity building. One early undertaking was the enhancement of the operational and physical infrastructure at Hovsgol National Park. Long-term ecological monitoring of several tributary watersheds began in 1997 and soon the site would be adopted into the 
International Long Term Ecological Research Network.

Recent work at Hovsgol is focusing on the consequences of and sustainable responses to climate change. The region lies in a transitional zone between the semi-arid Eurasian Steppe (grasslands) to the south and the Eurasian Taiga (boreal forest) to the north. As such, it is an ideal mid-continental site at which to monitor the ecological effects of climate change. In addition, changes in livestock herding practices raise concerns about overgrazing and desertification. In response, the team at Hovsgol created and distributed a &quot;Herder Handbook&quot; and continues to conduct research and work with nomadic herders to develop sustainable practices.

====Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey====
The Mongolian Aquatic Insect Survey is a multi-year biodiversity survey, environmental monitoring and capacity building project managed by Jon Gelhaus of the Academy&#x27;s Entomology Department. A total of 217 sites from the Selenge River Basin, the most populous and most extensive drainage in Mongolia, were surveyed from 2003 to 2006. Most of these sites are in rivers or streams, but some are in freshwater and saltwater lakes, hot and cold springs, and marsh wetlands. Additional sites from the remote drainage systems in western Mongolia will be sampled in 2008.

The survey has yielded numerous new species and hundreds of geographic records for known aquatic insects, provided an extensive dataset for ongoing environmental monitoring, and has helped develop research and technical infrastructures in Mongolia. This capacity building includes, in collaboration with the Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology, the building of the first research laboratory in Mongolia dedicated to the study of aquatic invertebrates. It also includes training of Mongolian scientists and students.

===Center for Environmental Policy===
The Center for Environmental Policy informs and engages various constituents, promotes solutions, and builds public and professional awareness on important environmental topics. Much of its activities focus on public programs and working groups.

The center hosts or participates in a number of public programs that are free and open to the public. Urban Sustainability Forums feature panels of local and national experts discussing environmental and sustainability topics as they relate to the Philadelphia region. Town Square, which may feature a panel or an individual, addresses a variety of topics relating to the environment or public science. The center also hosts candidate forums, conferences and workshops.

The center acts as a logistical hub for a number of Working Groups organized around sustainability issues. Currently active groups include one for condominium and building co-op owners, a network of faith-based environmental groups, and a forum of senior executives in the private sector.

===Ewell Sale Stewart Library===
The Library and Archives were established at the Academy&#x27;s founding meeting in 1812 for the purpose of supporting its natural science research. The library provides online access, services, collections, imaging, and shared resources with other libraries.

The library houses nearly 200,000 volumes ranging from works published in the 16th century to current journals and books. Its holdings also include illustrated works from as early as the 15th century, including Konrad Gessner&#x27;s &quot;Historia animalium&quot;, Maria Sibylla Merian&#x27;s &quot;Insects of Surinam&quot;, Edward Lear&#x27;s &quot;Psittacidae or Parrots&quot;, and a double elephant folio of John James Audubon&#x27;s &quot;The Birds of America&quot;.

===Scientific publications===
The &quot;Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences&quot; was the first peer-reviewed publication in the United States devoted to the natural sciences. The first volume was published in 1817. By 1842, it had been superseded by the &quot;Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences&quot;. The &quot;Proceedings&quot; have been published continuously since 1841. The &quot;Journal&quot; was reborn in 1847 as a larger-format publication that could accommodate longer articles and monographs. The last volume was issued in 1918.

The Academy publishes three other series. The occasional series &quot;Notulae Naturae&quot; began in 1939 as a means to quickly publish short items, usually not longer than 16 pages on subject areas such as zoology, botany, ecology, geology and paleontology. The &quot;Monographs&quot; series, which began in 1935, is composed principally of larger systematic reviews of selected taxonomic groups. The &quot;Special Publications&quot; series, begun in 1922, includes works such as biography, taxonomy, historical reviews, and collections surveys.

===VIREO===

VIREO (VIsual REsource for Ornithology) is the most comprehensive collection of bird images in the world. Started in 1979, the collection contains over 180,000 photographs representing over 7,300 species. The collection contains work by some of the world&#x27;s most talented photographers. VIREO licenses bird images for a wide variety of commercial and non-profit uses.

==Exhibits and public programs==

===Public exhibits===

The Academy first opened its collections to the public in 1828. The popularity of its exhibits soared in 1868 with the debut of the world&#x27;s first mounted dinosaur skeleton, &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;. The size of the crowds flocking to this display prompted the Academy to relocate to its present-and roomier-location in 1876.

====Collections and the public====
As with most museums in the 19th century, there was little separation of the Academy&#x27;s collections, which were vital to scientific work, and the public spaces. Not only did this subject the collections to extra wear and tear, but visitors were typically confronted with a bewildering assemblage of specimens with little in the way of supplemental information. Over time, however, museums such as the Academy started to showcase their more popular specimens while sequestering the bulk of the collections. In addition, they spent more effort interpreting their public displays. Museums started to play a more active role in educating the public.

====Dioramas====
One expression of this transformation was the rise of that icon of natural history museums, the diorama. These three-dimensional displays were the virtual reality of their time, providing generations of museum visitors with their only opportunity to experience distant places and exotic wildlife.

In 1929 program coordinator Harold T. Green created The Academy&#x27;s first diorama, depicting rocky mountain goats. Green&#x27;s work was at first controversial amongst The Academy&#x27;s staff, due to both the cost and accusations of sensationalism, but proved popular amongst the public. In 1935, the Works Progress Administration began providing artists to help work on the dioramas, fueling the exhibits&#x27; continued expansion.

By presenting the wilderness to the public, dioramas nurtured an appreciation of our natural heritage, which, coincided with the growth of the Conservation Movement in the United States. The Academy currently has 37 dioramas, most of which were installed in the 1930s and 1940s. They feature a variety of animals from Africa, Asia, and North America. Some of these, such as the caribou, lion, and plains zebra are familiar and relatively common, but others, such as the desert bighorn, kiang, Kodiak bear, panda, and passenger pigeon, are threatened, endangered, or extinct.

In 2018, under the management of Drexel University, The Academy renovated some of the older dioramas. These renovations were meant to increase the scientific accuracy of the displays and improve their aesthetics.

====Dinosaurs====

Another icon of natural history museums is the dinosaur skeleton. The first of these, the &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; mount created by noted natural history artist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, made its debut at the Academy in 1868. &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; mounts also found their way into other public venues, including Princeton University, the Royal Scottish Museum, the Smithsonian, and the 1876 American Centennial Exposition. A special exhibit on the history of &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot; ran from November 22, 2008 to April 19, 2009.

A skeletal mount of a related dinosaur, &quot;Corythosaurus&quot;, served as the centerpiece of the Academy&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Earth History&quot; during the middle of the 20th century. In 1986, the Academy opened a new exhibit, &quot;Discovering Dinosaurs&quot;. This was the first large-scale exhibit to incorporate the findings of the &quot;dinosaur renaissance&quot;. Instead of cold-blooded and lumbering reptiles, dinosaurs were conceived as active-and possibly warm-blooded-animals more akin to birds than reptiles.

In 1979, another type of dinosaur was the subject of an exhibition at the academy when it featured Jim Gary&#x27;s Twentieth Century Dinosaurs and found that it was an enormous success with the public. This unconventional exhibition for a museum of science that featured contemporary sculpture, which focused upon the subjects of intense scientific inquiry, began a trend among its peer institutions, who then began to invite Gary and several other artists who specialized in scientific topics and subjects to museums that always had shied away from anything identified as &quot;contemporary art&quot; as exhibitions.

====Other exhibits====
In 1979, the academy also opened &quot;Outside-In&quot;, a hands-on children&#x27;s nature museum. In 1995, it pioneered the hands-on simulation of a dinosaur dig, with its &quot;The Big Dig&quot;. Other permanent exhibits include &quot;Secrets of the Diorama&quot;, an insight into what goes into a diorama, and &quot;Science at the Academy&quot;, which showcases current Academy research.

The museum also has special, changing exhibits. Recent changing exhibits include &quot;Skin: Living Armor, Evolving Identity&quot;, &quot;Illuminating Birds&quot;, &quot;Extreme Deep: Mission to the Abyss&quot;, and &quot;Crocs: Ancient Predators in a Modern World&quot;.

===Public programs===

====Festivals====
Four weekend festivals organized around scientific disciplines, are held during the year. Paleopalooza, held in mid-February, features fossil collections and talks by leading paleontologists. Earth Day Festival, held in mid-April, features scientists from the Academy&#x27;s Patrick Center for Environmental Research. Bug Fest, held in mid August, features entomologists, insect collections and live insects. The Philadelphia Shell Show, held in mid-October, features an international shell market and competitive shell displays.

====Programs for adults====
The Academy began offering lectures to the public as early as the 1820s. Current offerings include natural history author talks, lectures by scientists, workshops and classes. In addition, the Center for Environmental Policy produces public programs on environmental issues.

====Programs for families and children====
Since its Nature Club in the 1930s, the Academy has offered programming just for children. Several programs appropriate for different age groups are currently offered. Safari Overnight sleepovers (camp-ins) are held on selected weekends during Fall, Winter, and Spring. Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts can participate in day workshops and sleepovers to fulfill badge and pin requirements. Tiny Tot Explorers is a program for toddlers. A new series of Family Workshops designed for both adults and children was launched in early 2010.

&quot;Wild Weekends&quot;, held on selected weekends throughout the year, offer a variety of children&#x27;s programs, including hands-on exploration of museum specimens, crafts and live animal shows with mammals, birds and reptiles. Live animal shows are also presented at regular times on other days and featured prominently in the educational programs.

===Educational programs===

====Field trips and outreach====
Field trips to the Academy are available throughout the year for schools, summer camps and other groups. Optional directed programs include Discovery Lessons for younger age groups (pre-K and higher) and Science Explorers for older children (grades 7 through 9). &quot;Academy on the Go&quot; is an educational outreach program that visits schools, camps, and community centers.

====Women in Natural Sciences====
WINS (Women in Natural Sciences) is an innovative and successful science enrichment program conducted by The Academy of Natural Sciences in collaboration with the School District of Philadelphia. Since its founding in 1982, WINS has been providing female public school students with hands-on science classes, scientific literacy and skill-building activities, and opportunities for personal growth in a uniquely nurturing setting.

====Other programs====
Academy Explorers Camp is a day camp program offered during Spring Break and the Summer. The George Washington Carver Science Fair is held in February or March. Science fair participants are eligible for the George Washington Carver Scholars summer program, which is also held at the Academy. Educator workshops are held throughout the year. The most recent series covered the integration of science and literacy skills. Self-guided workbooks tailored for younger children are available for some of the museum exhibits.

Gallagher Fellowship provides a unique opportunity for original, multi-year, postdoctoral or sabbatical research on the systematics of microscopic invertebrates, especially Rotifera. The research focus must be on systematics and may employ ecological, behavioral, physiological, molecular or developmental tools.

Jessup and McHenry Awards are competitively awarded to students wishing to conduct studies at the postgraduate, doctoral and postdoctoral levels under the supervision or sponsorship of a member of the curatorial staff of the Academy. The Jessup Award is given for any specialty in which our curators have expertise. The McHenry Fund is restricted to botanists.

The Eckelberry Endowment helps support the efforts of wildlife painters, sculptors, printmakers, and other artists to better acquaint themselves with the natural world through both museum and field research. In addition, artistic and scientific mentors counsel and assist these artists as their careers develop. One grant will be given each year.

Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), a program of the National Science Foundation, provides summer research experience for students attending colleges and universities. Each summer the Academy offers five to ten separate research projects which can include collections, field, imaging and/or lab work. The projects vary but typically include environmental, library collections, and/or systematics research.

<text>The Gulf of Riga, Bay of Riga, or Gulf of Livonia (, , ) is a bay of the Baltic Sea between Latvia and Estonia.

The island of Saaremaa (Estonia) partially separates it from the rest of the Baltic Sea. The main connection between the gulf and the Baltic Sea is the Irbe Strait.

The Gulf of Riga, as a sub-basin of the Baltic, also includes the Väinameri Sea in the West Estonian archipelago.

==Geography==

=== Extent ===

The International Hydrographic Organization defines the Gulf of Riga&#x27;s western limit as &quot;A line running from Lyser Ort (57°34&#x27;N), in Latvia, to the South extreme of Saaremaa, through this island to Pammana (22°34&#x27;E), thence to Emmaste Point, the S extreme of Hiiumaa, through Hiiumaa to Tahkuna Point, the North extreme thereof, and on to Spithamn Point in Estonia&quot;.

=== Islands ===
Major islands in the gulf include Saaremaa, Kihnu, and Ruhnu, which are all in Estonian territory. Kihnu covers an area of . Saaremaa island is responsible for the brackish water of the Gulf of Riga, as it is partially &quot;shielded&quot; from the Baltic Sea. The Baltic itself is already less salty than the global oceanic average, but this effect has a north–south and east–west gradient.

=== Cities ===
Notable cities around the gulf include Riga and Jūrmala in Latvia, and Pärnu and Kuressaare in Estonia. The main rivers flowing into the gulf are Daugava, Pärnu, Lielupe, Gauja, and Salaca.

==Salinity==
The freshwater runoff entering the Baltic sea accounts for two percent of its volume. A narrow connection to the North Sea means that water stays in the Baltic for an average of 30 years. These two characteristics work to make the Baltic Sea one of the largest brackish bodies of water in the world. The Gulf of Riga has an average salt concentration for the Baltic Sea, which is around six to ten parts per thousand. Freshwater has a concentration of 0.5 parts per thousand, and seawater is about 30 parts per thousand.

==Winter==
In winter, most or all of the Bay occasionally freezes. This is due to low salinity and the calming effect of the partial closure of the entrance of the gulf. During the winter, many people walk over the bay. The thickest recorded ice was thick in the winter of 1941–42. Ice hole fishing has been a traditional source of winter food, and remains a common activity. The ice usually melts between March and April. In late March 2013, when the ice started to melt, 200 people had to be rescued from ice floes.

<text>The Ferrari 456 and 456M (Type F116) are front-engine grand tourers which were produced by Italian automobile manufacturer Ferrari from 1992 to 2003. The 456 succeeded the front-engine 412 as the company&#x27;s V12-powered four-seater. The updated 456M, which was the last Ferrari model to use pop-up headlamps, was replaced in 2004 by the 612 Scaglietti.

==456==
Introduced in October 1993, the 456 was designed by Pietro Camardella at Pininfarina. The designer took heavy inspiration from the 365 GTB Daytona when designing the car. It was available in GT and (from 1996) GTA trims. The former has a six-speed manual, and the latter has a four-speed automatic developed in partnership with FF Developments, in Livonia,_Michigan (which was later purchased by Ricardo Engineering in the UK.) The automatic transmission used in the 456 was the second and last conventional hydraulic automatic transmission with a torque converter to be offered by Ferrari (The transmission found its first use in the 400/412 series). The 65° V12 engine was derived from the Dino V6 rather than the more conventional 60° V12s used in the 412 and Daytona. It is rated at , with 4 valves per cylinder and Bosch Motronic M2.7 engine management. Ferrari claims it could push the car to a top speed of , making it, at the time, the world&#x27;s second fastest production four-seater automobile behind the Porsche 959. Acceleration from 0- takes 4.8 seconds, with a 13.3 second quarter-mile time (400 m). At the time of its development, the 456 was the most powerful regular production road car ever developed by Ferrari. In 1996, the engine management system was changed to a Motronic M5.2 management and the engine with the updated system was given the &quot;F116C&quot; code.

The name 456 is derived from the fact that each cylinder displaces 456 cubic centimeters. This was the last Ferrari to use this naming convention until the 488 GTB. Despite its exceptional performance, the 456 has a relatively unstressed engine, which has proven to be a very reliable unit. A further developed version of this engine was used in the front-engine 550 Maranello grand tourer introduced in 1996, which became the most powerful naturally aspirated Ferrari production car aside from the 456.

The chassis is a tubular steel space-frame construction with a one-piece composite bonnet and body panels made from aluminium. The body panels are welded to the chassis via a special &quot;sandwich filler&quot; called &quot;feran&quot; that, when laid between, allows steel and aluminium to be welded. Pininfarina was responsible for the bodywork of the 456 until 1996 when production was moved to Ferrari. The total number of 456 bodies made by Pininfarina amounts to 1,435. 


==456M==
The 456M (M standing for &quot;Modificata&quot;) was unveiled in March 1998 at the Geneva Motor Show. Many changes were made to improve aerodynamics and cooling and the interior – still featuring Connolly Leather – was refreshed with new seats and other conveniences (three gauges on the dash instead of five, a new Becker stereo fitted in front of the shifter rather than behind as in the very shallow and special Sony head unit in the 456 GT and a revised real parcel shelf now featuring an integrated high level brake light). The intake ducts present on the bonnet on the original 456 were removed for a cleaner appearance and the size of the combined side markers/indicator lights was reduced. The brake ducts present on the apron of the original 456 were removed in favour of a larger intake located at the front of the car. The front suspension geometry now consisted of modified control arms to reduce dive under heavy braking and larger, 330 mm brake discs from the 550 Maranello were used at the front. At the rear of the car, a new bumper with a reshaped license plate housing was added along with a fixed undercarriage spoiler (the older 456 had a motorised spoiler that began its deployment above ). This worked in conjunction with a new panel manufactured from fiberglass and PVC. The aerodynamic improvements to the 456M resulted in the car being longer than the 456.

The bonnet was the first commercial application of carbon fibre, the previous being made of a composite material. Power output remained unchanged on the Modificata using Bosch Motronic M5.2 engine management at ; the cylinder firing order was changed for smoother running and the torque remained the same for later versions of the 456 GT.

===456 Bicolore Scaglietti===
The 456 Bicolore Scaglietti was launched at the 2002 Geneva Motor Show. The show car present at the stand was commissioned by then Ferrari F1 racing driver Michael Schumacher. Customers could work with the Carrozzeria Scaglietti personalisation programme to create a highly individual car. The car has a two-colour paint scheme with the roof, exterior mirrors and wheels painted Canna Di Fusile (Gunmetal Grey) whilst the rest of the body was painted Grigio Nuvolari. The car also featured a custom grey leather interior with red stitching featuring a plaque containing Schumacher&#x27;s signature and Formula 1 racing championship years, power adjustable seats with position memory settings, dual zone climate control, reworked gauges with a speedometer, an uprated handling pack, and cross-drilled Brembo brakes. Cars equipped with an automatic transmission would be thus designated as a Tipo 456M GT(A) Scaglietti. The car is also known as the 456M GT &quot;Schumacher Edition&quot; as Schumacher was the first to commission the car. A total of 30 cars were produced, with only 10 being made with the 6-speed manual transmission.

==Production==
The total production of the 456 amounted to 3,289 units. These consisted of the following versions: 

456: 1,951 

*456 GT: 1,548
* 456 GTA: 403

456M: 1,338 

* 456M GT: 688
* 456M GTA: 650

==Performance==
According to manufacturer estimates, the 456 GT can attain a top speed of and can accelerate from 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.2 seconds. The GTA can attain the same acceleration at 5.5 seconds. The Modificata models had the same performance statistics as their respective predecessors.

&quot;Car &amp; Driver&quot; magazine test results for 1995 456 GT were:

*Acceleration (seconds) : 0-: 4.8
*Standing quarter-mile, sec/mph: 13.3/107 
*Braking 70-0 mph: 170 ft
*Lateral acceleration: 0.89 g

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine test results for the 1995 456 GT were:

* Acceleration: 0-: 5.1 seconds
* Standing quarter-mile: 13.4 seconds at 108.8 mph
* Braking 60-0 mph: 124 ft

&quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine test results for the 1997 456 GTA were:

* Acceleration: 0-: 5.1 seconds
* Standing quarter-mile: 13.6 seconds 103 mph
* Braking 60-0 mph: 120 ft
* Lateral acceleration: 0.93 g

*Acceleration: 0-: 4.9 seconds
*Standing quarter-mile: 13.3 seconds 105.2 mph
*Braking 60-0 mph: 114 ft
*Lateral acceleration: 0.88 g
*Top Speed, 177 mph

==Other body styles==
While the 456 2+2 coupé was the only version offered to the general public, five other bodystyles were made on special request of specific customers:

* Ferrari 456 GT Saloon: At least three of these 4-door saloons (sedans) were built by Pininfarina especially for the Sultan of Brunei. 
* Ferrari 456 GT Venice: A series of seven 5-door estate (wagon) commissioned by Prince Jefri Bolkiah of Brunei. After Pininfarina designed and built them, the prince purchased six. It is unknown if the seventh car was purchased by a private car collector or if the remaining car was actually used as a development mule for testing. Each car is rumoured to have cost the Sultan&#x27;s brother around US$1.5 million. The first Ferrari estate ever built.
* Ferrari 456 GT Spyder: A convertible version of the 456, of which two were built by Pininfarina specially for the Sultan of Brunei.
* Ferrari 456 GT Cabriolet: There are also three aftermarket conversions made by the R. Straman Company of Costa Mesa, California, one of which was purchased by boxer Mike Tyson.

==Awards==

The 5.5 L V12 engine used in the 456 won the &quot;over 4-litre&quot; class of the International Engine of the Year award for 2000 and 2001.

<doc id="621583" wikidata="Q317142" url="?curid=621583" title="Leonardo Sciascia">
<text>Leonardo Sciascia (; 8 January 1921 – 20 November 1989) was an Italian writer, novelist, essayist, playwright, and politician. Some of his works have been made into films, including &quot;Porte Aperte&quot; (1990; &quot;Open Doors&quot;), &quot;Cadaveri Eccellenti&quot; (1976; &quot;Illustrious Corpses&quot;), &quot;Todo Modo&quot; (also 1976) and &quot;Il giorno della civetta&quot; (1968; &quot;The Day of the Owl&quot;). He is one of the greatest literary figures in the European literature of the 20th century.

==Biography==

Sciascia was born in Racalmuto, Sicily, on 8 January 1921. In 1935, his family moved to Caltanissetta, where Sciascia studied under Vitaliano Brancati, who would become his model in writing and introduce him to French novelists. From Giuseppe Granata, future Communist member of the Italian Senate, Sciascia learned about the French Enlightenment and American literature. In 1944, he married Maria Andronico, an elementary school teacher in Racalmuto. In 1948, his brother committed suicide, an event which profoundly impacted Sciascia.

Sciascia&#x27;s first work, &quot;Favole della dittatura&quot; (&quot;Fables of the Dictatorship&quot;), a satire on fascism in Italy, was published in 1950. This was followed in 1952 by &quot;La Sicilia, il suo cuore&quot; (&quot;Sicily, its Heart&quot;), his first and only poetry collection, illustrated by Emilio Greco. The following year Sciascia won the Premio Pirandello, awarded by the Sicilian Region, for his essay &quot;Pirandello e il pirandellismo&quot; (&quot;Pirandello and Pirandellism&quot;).

In 1954, he began collaborating with literature and ethnology magazines published by Salvatore Sciascia in Caltanissetta. In 1956, he published &quot;Le parrocchie di Regalpetra&quot; (&quot;The Parishes of Regalpetra&quot;), an autobiographic novel inspired by his experience as an elementary school teacher in his home town. In the same year, he moved to teach in Caltanissetta, only to move again to Rome in 1957 where he struck up a lifelong friendship with Sicilian artist, Bruno Caruso. In the autumn of 1957, he published &quot;Gli zii di Sicilia&quot; (&quot;Uncles of Sicily&quot;), which includes sharp views about themes such as the influence of the U.S. and of communism in the world, and the 19th century unification of Italy.

After one year in Rome, Sciascia moved back to Caltanissetta, in Sicily. In 1961, he published &quot;Il giorno della civetta&quot; (&quot;The Day of the Owl&quot;), one of his most famous novels, about the Mafia, and in 1963, the historical novel &quot;Il consiglio d&#x27;Egitto&quot; (&quot;The Council of Egypt&quot;), set in 18th-century Palermo. After a series of essays, in 1965 he wrote the play &quot;L&#x27;onorevole&quot; (&quot;The Honorable&quot;), a denunciation of the complicities between government and the mafia. Another political mystery novel is 1966&#x27;s &quot;A ciascuno il suo&quot; (&quot;To Each His Own&quot;).

The following year Sciascia moved to Palermo. In 1969, he began a collaboration with &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot;. That same year he published the play &quot;Recitazione della controversia liparitana dedicata ad A.D.&quot; (&quot;Recitation of liparitana dispute dedicated to A.D.&quot;), dedicated to Alexander Dubček. In 1971, Sciascia returned again to mystery with &quot;Il contesto&quot; (&quot;The Challenge&quot;), which inspired Francesco Rosi&#x27;s movie &quot;Cadaveri eccellenti&quot; (1976; &quot;Illustrious Corpses&quot;). The novel created Polemics, due to its merciless portrait of Italian politics, as did his novel &quot;Todo modo&quot; (1974; &quot;One Way or Another&quot;), due to its description of Italy&#x27;s Catholic clergy.

At the 1975 communal elections in Palermo, Sciascia ran as an independent within the Italian Communist Party (PCI) slate and was elected to the city council. In the same year, he published &quot;La scomparsa di Majorana&quot; (&quot;The Disappearance of Majorana&quot;), dealing with the mysterious disappearance of scientist Ettore Majorana. In 1977, he resigned from PCI, due to his opposition to any dealing with the &quot;Democrazia Cristiana&quot; (Christian Democratic party). Later, he would be elected to the Italian and European Parliament with the Radical Party.

Sciascia&#x27;s last works include the essay collection &quot;Cronachette&quot; (1985), the novels &quot;Porte aperte&quot; (1987; &quot;Open Doors&quot;) and &quot;Il cavaliere e la morte&quot; (1988; &quot;The Horseman and Death&quot;). He died on 20 November 1989 in Palermo.

== Writing ==

A number of his books, such as &quot;The Day of the Owl&quot; (&quot;Il giorno della civetta&quot;) and &quot;Equal Danger&quot; (&quot;Il contesto&quot;), demonstrate how the Mafia manages to sustain itself with the help of the anomie inherent in Sicilian life. He presented a forensic analysis of the kidnapping and assassination of Aldo Moro, a prominent Christian Democrat, in his book &quot;The Moro Affair&quot;.

Sciascia&#x27;s work is intricate and displays a longing for justice while attempting to show how corrupt Italian society had become and remains. His linking of politicians, intrigue, and the Mafia gave him a high profile, which was very much at odds with his private self. This high profile resulted in his becoming widely disliked for his criticism of Giulio Andreotti, then Prime Minister, for his lack of action to free Moro and answer the demands of the &quot;Brigate Rosse&quot; (Red Brigades).

In 1979, Sciascia was elected for the Radical Party in the House of Deputies and became a member of the committee of the House for the investigation into Moro&#x27;s kidnapping, which stated that there was a certain amount of negligence on the part of the Christian Democrat Party in their stance that the state was bigger than a person, and that they would not swap Moro for 13 political prisoners, even though Moro himself had stated that the swapping of innocent people for political prisoners was a valid option in negotiations with terrorists. However, senior members of the party disagreed with this stance and were of the view that Moro had been drugged and tortured to utter these words. Out of this experience, Sciascia wrote an important book.

Sciascia wrote of his unique Sicilian experience, linking families with political parties, the treachery of alliances and allegiances, and the calling of favours that result in outcomes that do not benefit society, but those individuals who are in favor. His books are rarely characterized by a happy ending or by justice for the ordinary man. A prime example of this is &quot;Equal Danger&quot; (1973; &quot;Il Contesto&quot;), in which the police&#x27;s best detective is drafted to Sicily to investigate a spate of murders of judges. Focusing on the inability of authorities to handle such an investigation into the corruption, Sciascia&#x27;s hero is finally thwarted.

His 1984 opus, &quot;Occhio di Capra&quot; (&quot;Goat&#x27;s Eye&quot;), is a collection of Sicilian sayings and proverbs gathered from the area around his native village, to which he was intensely attached throughout his life.

<text>David John McKee (2 January 1935 – 6 April 2022) was a British writer and illustrator, chiefly of children&#x27;s books and animations.

For his contribution as a children&#x27;s illustrator, he was UK nominee for the biennial international Hans Christian Andersen Award in 2006.

==Early life==
David John McKee was born on 2 January 1935 and raised in Tavistock, Devon, England. After attending grammar school, he studied at Plymouth College of Art.

While still at college, he began selling one-off cartoons, particularly to the national press. On leaving college, he continued this to support himself while painting, drawing regularly for, among others, &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, and &quot;The Times Educational Supplement&quot;.

The first book he sold was of a story he had told at college, &quot;Two Can Toucan&quot;. It is about a toucan who can carry two cans of paint on its enormous bill. This was published by Abelard-Schuman in 1964; a 1985 edition with new illustrations by McKee was re-issued in 2001 by Andersen Press.

==Writer and illustrator==
McKee produced several characters who formed the basis of book series, including &quot;Elmer the Patchwork Elephant&quot;. &quot;Elmer&quot; was first published by Dobson Books in 1968, and was re-issued by Andersen Press in 1989. His 29 Elmer books have sold more than 10 million copies and have appeared in more than 60 languages being adapted as a stage play and an animated series. The character has spawned a range of merchandise, including soft toys, from London Emblem and Elmer board books. McKee illustrated the songs &quot;Toy Boy&quot; and &quot;Lonely Alcoholic&quot; in singer-songwriter Mika&#x27;s extended play &quot;Songs for Sorrow&quot;. One of McKee&#x27;s earliest books, &quot;Six Men&quot; (1972, 2011), teaches how a war can develop.

He illustrated books by other authors, including some of the more recent Paddington Bear books. He also illustrated books written by his mother, Violet McKee, and by his son, Chuck McKee.

==Films and television==
The BBC used some of McKee&#x27;s books on television and asked about the possibility of a more extensive project. The result was the development of a series about one of McKee&#x27;s characters, the resulting series was &quot;Mr Benn&quot;, which ran for thirteen episodes first broadcast in 1971 and 1972 and was repeated regularly over the following two decades. Five films for the Save the Children fund followed, then a series of films based on the King Rollo books, with two friends, Clive Juster and Leo Nielsen. The company King Rollo Films was started. The company maintained its success, with McKee being involved on projects usually as a writer. They have been responsible for various films, including Tony Ross&#x27;s Towser, Eric Hill&#x27;s Spot the Dog, and Lucy Cousins&#x27;s Maisy. The company plans to produce 26 animated films of Elmer.

King Rollo Films has produced many other animations, including &quot;Spot the Dog&quot; and the animated stories within the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s programme &quot;Fimbles&quot;.

==Personal life and honours==
McKee had homes in London and the south of France where he lived with his partner Bakhta, a French-Algerian art-dealer. He shared with her an interest in collecting drawings and African tribal art. He won the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis in 1987. His previous wife was Barbara Ennuss, with whom he had three children.

He was awarded a BookTrust Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020, in recognition of his whole body of work. He declared it a &quot;shock&quot; but &quot;fantastic&quot;, and said he&#x27;d &quot;never been one for the spotlight or winning awards&quot;. McKee was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from Plymouth College of Art in 2011.

==Death==
McKee died on 6 April 2022 after a short illness. He was 87.

<doc id="621590" wikidata="Q334318" url="?curid=621590" title="James Chuter Ede">
<text>James Chuter Chuter-Ede, Baron Chuter-Ede, (; 11 September 1882 – 11 November 1965), was a British teacher, trade unionist and Labour Party politician. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for 32 years, and served as the sole Home Secretary under Prime Minister Clement Attlee from 1945 to 1951, becoming the longest-serving Home Secretary of the 20th century.

==Early life==
James Chuter Ede was born in Epsom, Surrey, elder son (there were two daughters) of &quot;lower-middle-class&quot; parents, James Ede, a Nonconformist (Unitarian) grocer (who had been an assistant to John Budgen, founder of the Budgens grocery store chain) and his wife Agnes Mary, daughter of local builder James Chuter. He was educated at Epsom National School, Dorking High School for Boys, Battersea Pupil Teachers&#x27; Centre, and Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he studied natural sciences. He attended Cambridge through a Surrey county scholarship, which did not cover his living expenses, and he ran out of funds at university, dropping out without a degree at the end of his second year. In April and May 1943, Ede&#x27;s ministerial boss Rab Butler would later arrange for him to receive an honorary MA from Cambridge. Either through his family background or by a decision made when a student, he became a Unitarian, and his religion consumed much of his time and effort later in life.

Had he graduated from Cambridge, Ede might have pursued a career as a science master in the grammar or public school systems, but instead he became an assistant master at council elementary schools in Surrey from 1905 to 1914, mainly in Mortlake. He took an active part in the Surrey County Teachers’ Association (SCTA), part of the National Union of Teachers. He was active in the Liberal Party, and in 1908 was elected as a member of Epsom Urban District Council, as the youngest councillor in Surrey, and probably the youngest urban district councillor in the country. In 1914, Ede stood for election to Surrey County Council and, as a council employee, had to resign his teaching post before the poll. He was elected, and never worked as a teacher again.

Much of his council work concentrated on education, as the SCTA wanted teacher representation on the Education Committee, to which, after a struggle, he was appointed. During the First World War he served in the East Surrey Regiment and Royal Engineers, reaching the rank of Acting Regimental Sergeant Major. He spent most of the War in France, probably working with poison gas.

==Early political career==
During the war, Ede joined the Labour Party, having been critical for some time of senior Liberal figures and of wartime establishment attitudes, and believing Labour better represented working people. He was selected as Labour candidate for Epsom in 1918, but was soundly defeated by a candidate who had been given the &quot;Coalition Coupon&quot;. He was appointed assistant secretary of the SCTA, which provided some Union sponsorship for his county council work. He retained this post until he became a Government minister, and he gradually took over running the Association, as well as dominating education policy in Surrey, a county where population increases brought about the need for much new school building.

Ede chaired Epsom UDC in 1920. Ede was first elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Mitcham, at a by-election in March 1923, which caused a considerable stir in the media. However, he lost the seat in December at the 1923 general election, and was defeated there again in 1924.

Ede eventually left Epsom UDC in 1927, having lived for some years in Mitcham. He returned to Parliament at the 1929 general election, for the Tyneside seat of South Shields. In the short-lived Labour government of 1929–31, Ede was appointed in 1930 to chair a government committee on educational standards in private schools. This reported in 1932, and Ede gradually became the Labour Party&#x27;s main specialist in the field of education, following the retirement from active politics of Charles Trevelyan, whose encouragement Ede had received, including through this appointment.

Ede had again lost his seat in Parliament at the 1931 election. He rejoined Epsom UDC (by now Epsom and Ewell UDC) in 1933, and chaired Surrey CC the same year. In 1934 Ede became chairman of the London and Home Counties Joint Electricity Authority, of which he had been a member since 1928. He held this post until 1940.

Ede was re-elected to Parliament for South Shields at the 1935 general election, and held the seat until his retirement from the Commons at the 1964 general election. When Epsom and Ewell were awarded borough status in 1937, he was chosen as the &quot;Charter Mayor&quot;, and led the activities celebrating the new Borough’s charter. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant for the county of Surrey. Ede also became chairman of the British Electrical Development Association in 1937.

Ede showed great interest in the sciences and the uses to which they could be put, being also a keen photographer. He also contributed greatly to environmental protection in Surrey, encouraging extension of green belt, the purchase of property to prevent development, and building bypasses to restrict traffic in town centres.

==Education Minister==

In the wartime coalition, Ede was appointed on 15 May 1940 to junior ministerial office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education, and served under two Conservative Presidents, first Herwald Ramsbotham, and then Rab Butler. Ede was a very safe pair of hands and his background complemented that of Butler, who was a practising Anglican, privately educated and from a well-to-do family, and who initially had little knowledge of state elementary schools. Ede was also a useful link between Butler and the Labour leaders Attlee, Arthur Greenwood and Ernest Bevin. (Ede was also governor of a Jesuit School, although that was less helpful.) Both men also gained a reputation for integrity. There remained considerable cross-party respect between Ede and Butler during their various later political activities.

He adopted the work initiated by the Board’s civil servants under Sir Maurice Holmes to reform education. On 4 February 1942 Ede, who had already grown to respect Butler, declined a request that he move to the Ministry of War Transport, although he would have obeyed a “direct order” from Churchill. Churchill deferred to Attlee’s wish to keep Ede in place.

Much of the time of ministers and officials was taken up in negotiating with the Protestant Churches, with the Church of England wanting greater control of religious education in state schools in return for the absorption of Anglican schools into the state system. The Church of England had been relatively sympathetic to Herwald Ramsbotham&#x27;s Green Book (June 1941), which had proposed permitting denominational teaching - which would in practice have been mostly Anglican - in state schools to children over the age of 11, lifting the ban which had been in place since the Cowper-Temple Clause of the 1870 Forster Act. Although agreement was eventually reached, a brief delay was caused by Ede&#x27;s &quot;White Memorandum&quot; of March 1942, published just before Easter. This reflected nonconformist lobbying since the Green Book, and Ede’s views and those of his officials. Anglicans, who had much support among Conservative MPs, were not pleased with the &quot;White Memorandum&quot; proposal for compulsory transfer of schools in &quot;single school areas&quot; (areas, mainly rural, where the Anglican school, often built by the local squire, was the &quot;only&quot; school) to LEA control, a move which tended to be favoured by nonconformists and teaching unions.

Ministers and officials had less success negotiating with the Roman Catholic Church, who wanted to retain complete autonomy in their schools while receiving 100% state subsidy for infrastructure (rather than the 50% on offer for Voluntary Aided, ie. semi-autonomous, schools). On one occasion (exact date not given by Butler&#x27;s biographers but probably in 1942-3), Butler and Ede drove to the Northern Bishops&#x27; conference at Ushaw College, near Hexham. They were given dinner and shown the chapel but were given no concessions.

Along with Butler, Ede published a formal white paper on planned education reform (July 1943). This covered several areas, including raising the school-leaving age to 15 or 16, enshrining the separation of elementary and secondary schooling from age 11 (as opposed to the existing overlap since the school leaving age had been raised to 14 in 1918), whether there should be separate schools for pupils with different aptitudes (favoured by education doctrine at the time, although in the event the choice was not prescribed in the 1944 Act but was left a matter of local option), how to assimilate public schools into the system (the Fleming Report would recommend that public school places be made open to state scholarships, although this was never implemented), and the ‘dual system’ of state and religious schools in the public sector.

With Butler, Ede steered the Education Act 1944 through Parliament, and it is clear that his detailed knowledge of state education, which Butler lacked, was crucial to the success of this measure. At the Second Reading of the bill in March 1944, Thelma Cazalet-Keir proposed two amendments, to raise the school leaving age to 16 by 1951 and demanding equal pay for women teachers, which were passed by 117-116 on 29 March 1944, the only time the Coalition suffered a significant defeat in a division. Butler, who thought it wrong to dictate to the teaching profession, stormed out of the Chamber and was rumoured to be about to resign. Ernest Bevin and Ede threatened to resign if Butler was forced out, and Churchill made the amendment a matter of confidence and ensured its defeat by 425-23 on 30 March. This was one of the events which made Churchill and the Conservatives appear reactionary, contributing to their election defeat in 1945.

The Act set the school-leaving age at 15 with effect from April 1947, with the long-term aim of raising it to 16, and made secondary education free, abolishing the term &quot;elementary school&quot;. It established nursery schools and classes, along with provision for children needing special educational treatment. It provided for further education, medical treatment in schools, school meals and milk, and social, religious and physical education. Independent schools were put under a programme of inspection, a compulsory act of worship introduced, and the rôle and requirements of local education authorities made clear.

==Home Secretary and later career==
Although he had expected to be appointed Minister of Education following the post-war Labour victory, Ede was appointed Home Secretary in the 1945 Labour government of Clement Attlee, and remained in that post throughout. He was concurrently Leader of the House of Commons in 1951. He was responsible for restructuring several public services, through the Police Act 1946, the Fire Services Act 1947, the Civil Defence Act 1948, and the Justices of the Peace Act 1949. In addition, he was closely involved in the Children Act 1948, the British Nationality Act 1948, the Representation of the People Act 1948, and the Criminal Justice Act 1948. He used his experience in local government and education to decide the right level of local authority control for services he reconstituted – the Fire Service, Civil Defence and the police, which he organised into a more professional force, with training centres developing consistent standards. Inheriting child care services and magistrates’ courts operating piecemeal throughout the country, his reforms set up consistent procedures and practices.

Changes to the electoral system in the Representation of the People Act finally established the principle of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; and single-member constituencies, for which in Ede&#x27;s view there had been pressure from the time of the Civil War and through the era of Chartism to his own period. He abolished university seats, along with the business vote, two-member constituencies and the privileged electoral status of the City of London.

The British Nationality Act established the single status of &quot;Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies&quot;, without regard to race or colour, so that all citizens of the UK and its colonies (there were few independent Commonwealth members at the time) continued to be equally able to live and work in the UK.

The Criminal Justice Act abolished the sentences of hard labour, penal servitude and whipping, and established new arrangements for probation and the treatment of young offenders. It also ended the right of peers to be tried by the House of Lords. Attempts to amend it to abolish capital punishment were unsuccessful (see below).

Ede established the Lynskey tribunal under Sir George Lynskey in 1948 to investigate allegations of corruption among ministers and civil servants. Changes he also brought about included ending the tradition that the Home Secretary attends royal births, which started following the rumours that James II’s son was an impostor, smuggled into the royal birth chamber. Ede helped change the date of the Grand National horse race to a Saturday, and proposed that Remembrance Sunday be moved to a date in the summer, reflecting the different days on which the World Wars ended (this was not taken up). He arranged the naturalisation of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and was involved in the choice of Mountbatten as his British surname.

Ede ceased to be in government when Labour lost the 1951 United Kingdom general election, and pursued other interests during his remaining 15 years in opposition. As well as his British Museum work, he became an active member of the BBC&#x27;s General Advisory Council, and held a leading role in the Unitarian Church. In 1964 he left the Commons and was created a life peer as &quot;Baron Chuter-Ede, of Epsom in the County of Surrey&quot;, on 1 January 1965, having accordingly adopted the surname &quot;Chuter-Ede&quot; on 18 December 1964.

==Unitarian Church==
When Home Secretary, Ede expanded his activities in the Unitarian Church, addressing its General Assembly in 1947, and arranging for the church to be represented at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday. He also spoke to various Unitarian congregations, and increased this activity after he left office in 1951. He attended congresses of the International Association for Liberal Christianity and Religious Freedom (IARF), and in 1955 was elected its President. In that connection, he paid more than one visit to North America.

From 1957 to 1958, Ede was President of the Unitarian General Assembly, and for a year he travelled tirelessly around the country, addressing different congregations.

==Capital punishment==
In 1938, Ede voted for a motion in favour of abolishing the death penalty for murder. This did not result in any change in the law but, when he was Home Secretary, his own Criminal Justice Bill in 1948 was successfully amended by MPs who wished to abolish hanging. However, by this time Ede, in line with the policy of the Attlee Government, opposed the reform. A person sentenced to hang was entitled to appeal to the Monarch for mercy, so in practice the Home Secretary, to whom the task was delegated, decided whether each execution should proceed. For a while he agreed to commute every death sentence to life imprisonment, but the House of Lords then rejected the amendment, and the Criminal Justice Act 1948 did not abolish capital punishment. He permitted hangings to continue.

In 1950 Timothy Evans was convicted of murdering his own daughter, and Ede approved his death sentence. In 1953, after John Christie had been convicted and hanged for a murder committed in the same house (and it was clear he had committed several others), Ede eventually concluded that he had made the wrong decision in regard to Evans.

He took part in the campaign for a pardon for Evans, and ended his career supporting the cause of abolition. In November 1965, capital punishment for murder was abolished by the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965, and Evans&#x27;s body was transferred to consecrated ground, shortly before Ede&#x27;s death. His campaign was described as &quot;the last struggle of a liberal nonconformist of the old school&quot;.

==Family==
Ede married Lilian Mary, daughter of Richard Williams, in 1917. They had no children, and she died in 1948, having been ill for some years. Lord Chuter-Ede survived her by 17 years and died at Ewell, Surrey, in November 1965, aged 83.

==Memorials==
Chuter Ede Education Centre in South Shields is named after him. It was formerly a comprehensive school. There are also a ward in Epsom Hospital and a primary school near Newark-on-Trent which bear his name. The Labour Party headquarters in South Shields is at Ede House, opened and named shortly before he ceased to be its MP.

Ede left twelve volumes of diaries, now residing in the British Library. The diaries (largely neither transcribed nor published) give an account of his wartime activities from 1941 to 1945 in great detail, as well as shorter memoirs from his time as Home Secretary, which illustrate the wide range of duties and concerns which went with that office in the mid-20th century. At the suggestion of an historian who used them, with his permission, in her research, he left most of them to the British Museum, of which he became a trustee – initially &quot;ex officio&quot; as Home Secretary, and then in his own right when he lost office.

<text>Colonel Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald, (12 June 1852 – 10 September 1915) was a British soldier and diplomat, best known for his service in China and Japan.

==Early life==
MacDonald was born the son of Mary Ellen MacDonald (&quot;nee&quot; Dougan) and Major-General James (Hamish) Dawson MacDonald. He was educated at Uppingham School and Sandhurst. He was commissioned into the 74th Foot in 1872. He thought of himself as a &quot;soldier-outsider&quot;, as regards his subsequent career in the Foreign Office.

==Africa==
MacDonald’s early career was in Africa. He served in the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, and served as military attaché to Sir Evelyn Baring from 1884 to 1887. From 1887 to 1889, he was Acting-Agent and Consul-general at Zanzibar, and then served some years as Commissioner and Consul-General at Brass in the West African Oil Rivers Protectorate, where in 1895 he was an observer of the rebellion of King Koko of Nembe. He retired from the British Army in 1896.

==China and Korea==
In 1896, MacDonald was appointed Her Majesty&#x27;s Minister in China. He was simultaneously the British Minister to the Empire of Korea in 1896 through 1898.
In China, MacDonald obtained a lease at Weihaiwei, and obtained railway contracts for British syndicates. He was instrumental in securing the Second Peking Convention, by which China leased to Britain the New Territories of Hong Kong. MacDonald secured a 99-year lease only because he thought it was &quot;as good as forever&quot;. This and the contrasting lease-in-perpetuity of Kowloon created some problems in the negotiations for the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.

In 1899 MacDonald was the author of a diplomatic note which he proposed, on behalf of British India, a boundary line between Jammu and Kashmir and the Chinese Turkestan, ceding roughly half of the Aksai Chin plateau, in return for China relinquishing its shadowy suzerainty over Hunza. The proposed boundary came to be known as the Macartney–MacDonald Line. The Qing China never made any response to the proposal. But the proposed boundary is still seen by scholars and commentators to have some relevance to the present day boundary disputes between China and India.

As a military man, MacDonald led the defence of the foreign legations in 1900 which were under siege during the Boxer Rebellion, and he worked well with the Anglophile Japanese colonel Shiba Gorō.

==Japan==
MacDonald was appointed Consul-General to the Empire of Japan in October 1900. He headed the British Legation in Tokyo during a period of harmonious relations between Britain and Japan (1900 to 1912), swapping appointments with Sir Ernest Satow who replaced him as Minister in Peking. On 30 January 1902, the first Anglo-Japanese Alliance was signed in London between the Foreign Secretary Lord Lansdowne and Hayashi Tadasu, the Japanese Minister.

MacDonald was still in Tokyo when the alliance was renewed in 1905 and 1911. He became Britain&#x27;s first ambassador to Japan when the status of the legation was raised to that of embassy in 1905. Before 1905 the senior British diplomat in Japan had simultaneously held the joint positions of (a) Consul-General and (b) Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary; the latter being a rank just below that of ambassador. MacDonald was made a Privy Councillor in 1906.

He died of heart failure at his residence in London on 10 September 1915. He is buried with his wife in Brookwood Cemetery.

==Ethel, Lady MacDonald, DBE==
In 1892, MacDonald wed Ethel (1857–1941), daughter of Major W. Cairns Armstrong; they remained married until his death in 1915. They had two daughters. Awarded the Royal Red Cross (RRC) and a Member of the Executive Committee of the Overseas Nursing Association, Lady MacDonald was named Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in her own right in 1935.

<doc id="621595" wikidata="Q1132506" url="?curid=621595" title="Type 53 torpedo">
<text>Type 53 is the common name for a family of 53 cm (21 inch) torpedoes manufactured in Russia, starting with the 53-27 torpedo and continuing to the modern UGST (Fizik-1), which is being replaced by the Futlyar.

With the exception of the UGST which uses Mark 48 style monopropellants, Soviet 53 cm torpedoes generally use electric power (since middle of World War II), or kerosene mixed with various oxidizers for propulsion. Russian torpedoes are often named descriptively for their characteristics – examples include &quot;acoustic homing&quot; or &quot;electric torpedo&quot;, all in Russian acronyms.

==History==
===Early history===

Model 53-27 (1927) with of TNT was developed domestically in the so-called , and it had a poor range at . In 1932 USSR bought in Italy several types of torpedoes, and the model of Whitehead Torpedo Factory in Fiume (in the Soviet Union it was designated 53F) was considered superior. After adapting several features from the latter in unsuccessful 53-36 the decision was made to copy 53F. Resulting 53-38 (3 speed regimes, range up to , of trotyl in warhead) was later upgraded to 53-38U ( of TNT, roughly the same characteristics) and then redesigned in 53-39 (, up to ), considered to be one of the fastest in the world at the time (another were secret Japanese oxygen torpedoes and the Italian Siluro Tipo W. 270/533, 4 × 7,20 Veloce).

===World War II===

The 53-38/53-38U, which had entered service in 1938–1939, were the main Soviet torpedoes in World War II; they proved to be fairly reliable and effective. The two deadliest sinkings in history (the German 25,484-ton military transport and the troop transport ) were performed by two Soviet submarines using 53-38s on 30 January and 16 April 1945; both ships were hit on first attempt and sank within minutes despite difficult visibility conditions and the presence of escorts. Notably, all three torpedoes launched against &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; hit and exploded with catastrophic results, not a common feat in those times and conditions.

Another notable sinking with 53-38/53-38Us was the 14,660-ton . During the Black Sea campaigns (1941–44), Soviet submarines sank at least 29,000 tons of enemy shipping, mostly using mines, shellfire and 53-38 torpedoes.

The new 53-39 (entering service in 1941) was very fast and effective but only available in limited numbers, while the ET-80 (1942–1943) was the first Soviet electric torpedo and crews did not trust it because of its teething and rushed induction problems.

===Cold War===

The first Soviet torpedo with passive-homing capability was the SAET-50 (1950), which was an anti-ship weapon used on submarines. The 53-61 was the first Soviet homing torpedo to exceed 40 knots.

The 53-65 torpedo family are Russian made, wake-homing torpedoes designed to destroy surface ships. The 53-65 became operational in 1965, while the 53-65K and 53-65M both became operational in 1969. The 53-65KE is an exported version. China received an unknown number of 53-65KE torpedoes from Russia after purchasing four s in the 1990s.

The Type 53 torpedo is carried by almost all Russian submarines, including the Kilo class and the .

The Type 53-65 torpedo is considered a significant threat by the United States Navy because they do not respond to usual torpedo countermeasures; typical torpedo countermeasures are decoys that use noise to distract homing torpedoes, analogous to an aircraft&#x27;s flare or chaff systems, but the Type 53-65 uses sensors that follows the wake of a moving ship, snaking through the ship&#x27;s trail until impacting it, from up to () away. The threat of wake homing torpedoes influenced the U.S. Navy to develop the Surface Ship Torpedo Defense (SSTD) system that employs a maneuvering Countermeasure Anti-Torpedo (CAT) that seeks and intercepts an incoming torpedo.

===UGST===
The last entry in the class is the UGST (Fizik-1) heavy deepwater torpedo with a range of up to (export versions are limited to 40 km). It differs from most previous Soviet and Russian torpedoes in that unlike the previously dominant electric or peroxide propulsion, it uses the Otto fuel axial engine, which allows it to have much extended range while keeping the speeds of up to 65 knots. It also features an updated homing system, which, in addition to the traditional passive wake homing, features a phased array active sonar and an improved wire guidance system: previous Soviet torpedoes had the guidance wire spool in the torpedo body, with the wire released through the hollow propeller shaft, which had the disadvantage of the wire being prone to breakage, while the UGST has the wire release port on the side. Together with the towed extender spool, kept in the calmer portion of the wake, this makes the wire much more durable than before, though not as durable as the tube mounted spool (not used by the Soviets/Russian Navy as it interferes with the automatic reload systems). It was supposed to enter service in the 1990s, but the teething problems and the lack of funding during that period made the deployment sluggish, and it entered the widespread service only in the 2015 by the Fizik name, being quickly replaced by the new-generation Futlyar (&quot;Fizik-2&quot;). Sources refer to them as heat-seeking torpedoes.

<text>Graeme Dott (born 12 May 1977) is a Scottish professional snooker player and snooker coach from Larkhall. He turned professional in 1994 and first entered the top 16 in 2001. He has won two ranking titles, the 2006 World Snooker Championship and the 2007 China Open, and was runner-up in the World Championships of 2004 and 2010. He reached number 2 in the world rankings in 2007, but a subsequent episode of clinical depression seriously affected his form, causing him to drop to number 28 for the 2009–10 season. He then recovered his form, regained his top-16 ranking, and reached a third World Championship final. In 2011, he published his autobiography, &quot;Frame of Mind: The Autobiography of the World Snooker Champion.&quot;

==Career==

===Early career===
After winning the UK Under-19 Championship in 1992 and Scottish Amateur Championship in 1993, Dott turned professional in 1994. He slowly climbed the rankings, reaching the top sixteen in 2001, where he remained until 2009. Early successes included reaching the quarter-final of the 1996 Welsh Open and qualifying for the World Championship for the first time in 1997. Dott was a runner-up in the 1999 Scottish Open, the 2001 British Open, the 2004 World Championship and the 2005 Malta Cup. He scored his first competitive 147 break in the 1999 British Open.

===2006 World Championship victory===

Dott started his campaign with an easy 10–3 victory over former champion John Parrott, before beating veteran Nigel Bond 13–9 in the second round. In his quarter-final match against Australia&#x27;s Neil Robertson, Dott took a 12–8 lead, before being pegged back to 12–12, and then edging through the deciding frame to win 13–12. In the semi-finals, he faced then two-time champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in a rematch of their 2004 Championship final. They finished the second session tied 8–8, but Dott swept O&#x27;Sullivan in the third session en route to a 17–11 victory.

Dott faced Peter Ebdon in the final for the £200,000 prize. He began the last session leading 15–7, but Ebdon won six successive frames to reduce the deficit to two. Dott eventually won 18–14, after winning some vital frames with impressive clearances.

It stands as the longest final ever, and was, at the time, the latest to finish (John Higgins&#x27;s victory over Mark Selby the following year now holds the record). The previous record holder had been the classic final frame black ball finish 1985 final between Englishman Steve Davis and Northern Irishman Dennis Taylor, which ended at 12:19 a.m. (GMT). The Dott–Ebdon match finished half an hour later, despite featuring three fewer frames, reflecting the slow overall pace of the match, so slow that both afternoon sessions only had six frames, rather than the usual eight. Moreover, at over 74 minutes, the 27th frame was the then longest in the history of the World Championship, beating the previous record of 70 minutes set by Canadian Cliff Thorburn and Welshman Doug Mountjoy, a record that would stand until 2009.

The victory over Ebdon took Dott&#x27;s ranking up to number 6 for the 2006/2007 season, a career high at the time.

===Post-title career===
Dott shone in the 2006 UK Championship as well, reaching the semi-finals, where he lost 7–9 to Stephen Hendry (a player who Dott never managed to beat in a ranking tournament) after an earlier 7–5 lead. He briefly became the provisional world number one in the rankings system after overcoming Jamie Cope 9–5 to win the 2007 China Open, his second ranking tournament win. Prior to this, he disliked going to China, not helped by a disastrous match in 2002. However, going into the 2007 World Championship as defending champion, he suffered a shock 7–10 defeat in the first round to Ian McCulloch in the opening match of the tournament, which dented his prospects of remaining world number 1. Newly crowned world champion John Higgins overtook him. The loss against McCulloch also maintained the &quot;Crucible curse&quot;, as Dott became the seventeenth consecutive first-time champion to lose his title the very next year.

The 2007–08 season was more of a struggle for Dott, who described his late-2007 form as &quot;hopeless... nowhere near to playing a good enough standard&quot;. His season started promisingly, as he reached the semi-finals of the season-opening 2007 Shanghai Masters, where he defeated Michael Holt 5–4, tournament favourite Ding Junhui 5–1, and Stephen Lee 5–4, before losing his semi-final against Ryan Day 2–6, to close the gap on world number 1 John Higgins, who went out in the second round; however, Dott then won no further matches that season; a run of twelve consecutive defeats, including all five group matches in the 2007 Grand Prix, started from October 2007 onwards. In the 2007 UK Championship he was eliminated in the first round, 7–9, by unseeded Dave Harold, while in the Masters he lost 5–6 to eventual runner-up Stephen Lee for the third successive year. Another first-round elimination followed in the 2008 Malta Cup, this time to Mark Williams. In the 2008 Welsh Open he lost his opening match against Michael Judge 4–5. In frame 7, when leading 4–2, he missed the pack completely with his break-off after miscuing, and also failed to hit the bunch on his next shot after being snookered. Dott announced that he might miss the 2008 World Championship for personal reasons, and his manager said he had been suffering from depression. However, he did eventually participate in the tournament, but was eliminated in the first round for a consecutive year, losing 7–10 to Joe Perry, dropping him to number 13 in the new world rankings, and finishing the season outside the top 32 in the one-year rankings.

Things did not improve in the early part of 2008–09, when a broken left arm sustained while playing football forced him to pull out of the 2008 Shanghai Masters and 2008 Grand Prix.

Dott won the Berlin leg of the World Series of Snooker, but withdrew from the Moscow event two days before it began, as his wife was preparing to give birth. He reached the second round of the 2009 World Championship for the first time since winning the title in 2006, but lost to Mark Selby 10–13, causing him to drop out of the top 16.

At the 2010 World Championship, Dott produced an unlikely run to his third World final in six years. He had not had much success in the 2009–10 season going into the World Championship, with only one ranking last 16 finish in the 2010 Welsh Open. However, a newly inspired Dott convincingly knocked out Peter Ebdon in the first round 10–5. He then thrashed fellow Scot Stephen Maguire 13–6 in the second round, and for the first time since winning the title in 2006, advanced to the quarter-finals where he recovered from 10 to 12 behind to see off Mark Allen 13–12. In his 17–14 defeat of Mark Selby in the semi-final, he scored the second 146 clearance in the 83-year history of the World Championship (the first had been scored by Mark Allen just days earlier in his second round match). Dott was eventually defeated in the final 13–18 by Neil Robertson, who had never beaten Dott previously, an ironic twist after Dott had defeated previous champion Ebdon for the first time in winning his own title in 2006. Despite having to settle for runner-up spot, Dott&#x27;s efforts were ultimately rewarded with a return to the top 16 for 2010/2011.

He returned a year later with a strong campaign at the World Championship, beating Mark King and Ali Carter before losing to in-form Judd Trump in the quarter-finals. He finished the 2010–11 season ranked world number 10.

===2011/2012 season===
Dott missed the first ranking event of the 2011–12 season, the Australian Goldfields Open due a neck injury, but he took part in the remaining seven ranking tournaments. He was knocked out in the first round in the Shanghai Masters and Welsh Open and didn&#x27;t get past the last 16 of the 2011 UK Championship, German Masters or the China Open. Dott&#x27;s best run of the season came at the World Open, where he beat Barry Hawkins and Marcus Campbell, before losing 1–5 to Stephen Lee in the quarter-finals. He also reached the quarter-finals of the Masters, where he was defeated by John Higgins 3–6.

Dott lost 2–4 to Ben Woollaston in the final of Event 3 of the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship, after earlier having overcome Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, Stephen Hendry and John Higgins. He also reached three semi-finals after playing in 11 of the 12 events throughout the season. Those results meant that Dott finished 7th on the PTC Order of Merit and therefore qualified to the last 16 of the Finals, where he lost 2–4 to Joe Perry.
Dott played in the first ever professional snooker tournament in South America, the non-ranking Brazil Masters, and reached the final only to be whitewashed 0–5 by Shaun Murphy. He also lost in the final of the Snooker Shoot-Out to Barry Hawkins, in a tournament where the winner of each round is decided by a 10-minute frame.

Dott&#x27;s season came to an unceremonious end when he suffered his heaviest ever World Championship defeat, losing to Joe Perry 1–10. He stated after the match that it was the worst he had played as a professional. Nevertheless, he maintained his place in the elite top 16 at number 13.

===2012/2013 season===
During the 2012/2013 season, Dott lost in the last 16 of the 2012 UK Championship (2–6 to Shaun Murphy), the German Masters (4–5 to Murphy), the Welsh Open (1–4 to Pankaj Advani), the World Open (0–5 to Neil Robertson), and the China Open (4–5 to Marcus Campbell). He reached the quarter-finals of the Wuxi Classic, where he lost 0–5 to Mark Davis, and the Shanghai Masters, where he lost 4–5 to Judd Trump.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2013 Masters, Dott defeated Stephen Maguire 6–5 and Trump 6–1 to reach the semi-finals. Despite taking a 4–1 lead in his semi-final match, Dott lost 5–6 to eventual tournament winner Mark Selby.

At the World Championship, Dott defeated Peter Ebdon 10–6 in a first-round match that lasted 7 hours 18 minutes, with an extra session added after the players failed to complete the match in the time allotted for the first two sessions. After the match, Dott criticised Ebdon&#x27;s slow, deliberative style of play and called for a rule to limit the amount of time a player could spend over a shot. Dott became the only Scottish player to reach the second round, after John Higgins, Stephen Maguire, Marcus Campbell, and Alan McManus all suffered first-round defeats. Facing Shaun Murphy in his second-round match, he trailed 2–6 after the first session. During the second session, he complained about receiving static shocks when he touched the table, and the players took their mid-session interval a frame early while the carpet was sprayed with water to address the problem. Dott managed to level the match at 8–8 after the second session, but went on to lose 11–13. His defeat meant that, for the first time since 1988, no Scottish player competed in the World Championship quarter-finals.

===2013/2014 season===
Dott&#x27;s 2013/2014 season got off to a poor start, as he was whitewashed 0–5 by Jimmy Robertson in the last 64 of the season&#x27;s first major ranking event, the 2013 Wuxi Classic. More disappointing results followed, including a 2–4 loss to Ratchayothin Yotharuck in the last 128 of the 2013 Indian Open, but he recovered to reach the semi-finals of the International Championship, where he lost 7–9 to eventual tournament winner Ding Junhui.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the last 16 of the 2013 UK Championship, but was beaten 2–6 by Mark Selby. He advanced to the quarter-finals of the World Open and reeled off four consecutive frames to level his match against Shaun Murphy, but the Englishman fluked the final black in the decider to defeat him 5–4. At the China Open, Dott reached another quarter-final but lost 3–5 to world number one Neil Robertson. He missed out on playing in the World Championship for the first time since 1999 as he was knocked out by Kyren Wilson 7–10 in the final qualifying round. Dott ended the season outside the top 16 for the first time in six years, as world number 17.

In July 2014, Dott started coaching snooker professionally to help encourage and influence the rising number of younger players within his native Scotland.

===2014/2015 season===
Dott&#x27;s first quarter-final appearance of the season came at the Shanghai Masters after he defeated Yan Bingtao 5–2 and Shaun Murphy 5–3, but he lost 2–5 to Ding Junhui. He suffered a 1–6 first round loss to Craig Steadman at the International Championship, before whitewashing Robert Milkins 6–0 to face Neil Robertson in the fourth round of the 2014 UK Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He went 5–0 up, only for Robertson to level at 5–5, before Dott won the decider to reach the quarter-finals of the event for the first time since 2006. Dott said that he had reverted to the way he played in 2010, with a more carefree approach to the game which he felt had helped his good form in the tournament. In the quarter-finals, he once again let his lead slip but this time couldn&#x27;t recover as Stuart Bingham came back from 1–4 down to defeat him 6–5. At the inaugural World Grand Prix, Dott came through a pair of deciding frames against John Higgins and Liang Wenbo, before losing 1–4 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the quarter-finals.

===2015/2016 season===
Dott advanced to the third round of the International Championship courtesy of wins over Jamie Burnett and Peter Ebdon, but he was defeated 1–6 by Neil Robertson. He lost in the second round of the 2015 UK Championship 5–6 to Jack Lisowski.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the German Masters, he knocked out Tian Pengfei 5–0, Barry Hawkins 5–3, and Stephen Maguire 5–1, to play in his first ranking event semi-final in over two years. He was well below his best against Martin Gould as he lost the first four frames of the match and was defeated 2–6. Dott was eliminated in the third round of both the Welsh Open and China Open, 2–4 to Marco Fu and 1–5 to Noppon Saengkham respectively. Three tight wins helped him qualify for the World Championship, but he lost 4–10 to Mark Williams in the opening round.

===2016/2017 season===
The 2016–17 season proved to be the first since 2002/2003 that Dott failed to reach the quarter-finals of a ranking event. He had to wait until the 2017 Welsh Open in February to play in the third round of an event, after beating Ricky Walden and Adam Stefanów, but he lost 2–4 to Lee Walker. He qualified for the World Championship and beat Ali Carter 10–7 in the first round, before being defeated 6–13 by Barry Hawkins.

==Personal life==
In his 2011 autobiography &quot;Frame of Mind&quot;, Dott describes his childhood growing up in the run-down Easterhouse estate in Glasgow. As a boy, he developed a strong relationship with Alex Lambie, a snooker club owner from Larkhall in Lanarkshire, who mentored Dott from the age of 12 and went on to manage his professional career. Dott has described Lambie as a &quot;second father&quot; to him. In 1997, Dott began a relationship with Lambie&#x27;s 16-year-old daughter Elaine. The couple married in 2003 and had their first child, a son named Lewis, in 2004.

In January 2006, Alex Lambie was diagnosed with terminal kidney cancer. Although he lived to see Dott win the World Championship in May of that year, he died on 16 December 2006, while Dott was playing in the 2006 UK Championship. Weeks afterward, Elaine, who was pregnant, had a cancer scare when doctors discovered potentially cancerous cysts on her ovaries. Although she turned out not to have cancer, she suffered a miscarriage while Dott was playing in the 2007 Masters. After these experiences, Dott entered a severe depression, which affected his commitment to practice and his performance in matches. He lost 15 consecutive professional matches and slid down the rankings, dropping out of the top 16. Medication subsequently helped him recover his place in the top 16, although he expects his battle with depression to be lifelong. Dott and his wife had a second child, a daughter Lucy, born in November 2008.

Dott supports Rangers and paraded his World Championship trophy at Ibrox, their home ground, during half-time of Rangers&#x27; final league match against Hearts on 7 May 2006.

<text>A Playboy Bunny is a cocktail waitress who works at a Playboy Club and selected through standardized training. Their costumes were made up of lingerie, inspired by the tuxedo-wearing Playboy rabbit mascot. This costume consisted of a strapless corset teddy, bunny ears, black sheer-to-waist pantyhose, a bow tie, a collar, cuffs and a fluffy cottontail. In more recent Playboy Clubs, such as Sin City that was re-opened in 2006, Playboy bunnies wore slightly altered costumes that were based on the original bunny suit.

== Origins ==

The original Playboy Bunny costume was designed by the mother of Ilse Taurins, who was a Latvian émigrée. At the time, Taurins was dating one of the Playboy Club co-founders, Victor Lownes III.

Taurins had suggested a costume modeled after the Playboy Magazine trademark, either a rabbit or bunny, and she had her seamstress mother make a costume prototype. The prototype was reviewed at a meeting attended by Playboy Club co-founders Hugh Hefner, Victor Lownes and Arnold Morton, as well as frequent Playboy illustrator LeRoy Neiman.

The outfits were initially not received well by the co-founders, but Hefner advised that it could work once changes were made. The initial costume looked similar to a one piece swimsuit, with a white yarn puff tail and a headband with bunny ears, and Hefner suggested cutting the leg higher on the hip to expose more of the leg, and sharpening the v-shape of the costume. His suggested modifications were in an attempt to make the costumes more visually appealing, and the tightly laced corsets added to the feminine appeal, cinching in the Bunny&#x27;s waist by at least two inches. This redesign of the bunny costume tied in directly with the need for a show-girl type of costume, achieving this look with an addition of bow ties, collars and a fluffy cottontail.

For mass production, the costume was manufactured for the Playboy Clubs by the Chicago-based Kabo Corset Company, and was based upon a &quot;merry widow&quot; style of corset within their line.

Later, in 1962, French fashion designer Renee Blot was further employed to refine the design, and her revisions included making the ears smaller, adding a collar with bow tie and cuffs with rabbit-head cufflinks, and a satin rosette with the bunny&#x27;s name, worn on the hip. The original costumes were made in twelve colours of rayon satin. Several years later, Playboy engaged a prominent manufacturer of lingerie and swimwear to create a modified bunny costume that used washable stretch knit fabrics, allowing for costumes in vibrant prints as well as solid colors. The standard stockings also evolved from fishnet material to a special sheer pantyhose style supplied by Danskin. Bunnies wore two pairs of these sheer stockings, a black pair worn on top of a taupe toned pair.

In the 1970s, Lownes used his country mansion, Stocks House in Hertfordshire, England, as a training camp for Bunnies. The Bunnies acted as hostesses at lavish parties thrown in the house.

Since 2013, rumours have suggested the original design of the Playboy bunny costume was by New York fashion designer Zelda Wynn Valdes, however, there exists no evidence to support this. This is also contradicted by recounts in much earlier publications such as &quot;Big Bunny&quot; by Joe Goldberg (1967) and &quot;The Bunny Years&quot; by Kathryn Leigh Scott (1998).

The bunny costume became a symbol of the Playboy Clubs, and was also the first commercial uniform to be registered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. trademark registration number 0762884).

== Training and qualifications ==
The Playboy Bunnies are waitresses who serve drinks at Playboy Clubs. There are different types of Bunnies, including the Door Bunny, Cigarette Bunny, Floor Bunny, Pool Bunny, Fine Dining Bunny, Playmate Bunny, and the Jet Bunnies (specially selected Bunnies trained as flight attendants; they served on the Playboy &quot;Big Bunny&quot; Jet).

To become a Bunny, women are first carefully chosen and selected from auditions. Bunnies then undergo thorough and strict training before officially becoming a Bunny. Bunnies are required to be able to identify 143 brands of liquor and know how to garnish 20 cocktail variations. Customers are not allowed to touch the Bunnies, demerits are given if a Bunny&#x27;s appearance does not meet requirements, and dating or mingling with customers is forbidden.

A Bunny also has to master the required maneuvers to work. These include the &quot;Bunny Stance&quot;, a posture that is required in front of patrons, where the Bunny must stand with legs together, back arched and hips tucked under. When the Bunny is resting or waiting to be of service, she must do the &quot;Bunny Perch,&quot; where she must sit on the back of a chair, sofa, or railing without sitting too close to a patron. The most famous maneuver of all, the &quot;Bunny Dip&quot;, was invented by Kelly Collins, once renowned for being the &quot;Perfect Bunny&quot;. To do the &quot;Bunny Dip&quot;, the Bunny gracefully leans backwards while bending at the knees with the left knee lifted and tucked behind the right leg. This maneuver allows the Bunny to serve drinks while keeping her low-cut costume in place. Strict regulations were enforced by special workers in the guise of patrons.

== Description ==
The uniforms were tailored to each Bunny at the clubs in which they worked, and a full-time seamstress always remained on duty whenever the club opened. The costumes were stocked in two pieces, the front part being pre-sewn in different bra cup sizes, and the seamstress would match the Bunnies&#x27; figure to the correct fitting front and back pieces. The two pieces were then sewn together to fit each person with great precision.

A woman, also known as the &quot;Bunny Mother&quot;, took responsibility for the welfare of the women working as Playboy Bunnies. This was a human-resources role and a management position as the Bunny Mother was in charge of scheduling work shifts, hiring, firing and training. The Club Manager carried two responsibilities for the Bunnies – floor service and weigh-in. Before every shift, the Manager would weigh each Bunny, and bunnies could not gain or lose more than one pound, with exceptions only being made for water retention. Playboy Enterprises required all employees to turn in their costumes at the end of employment and Playboy still retains some of these costumes in storage. Occasionally, costumes are offered for sale on the Playboy Auction site or eBay, but some of the costumes on eBay are known to be counterfeit or damaged. The only two costumes on public display are in the collections of the Smithsonian and the Chicago History Museum.

=== Reception and review ===
The treatment of Playboy Bunnies was exposed in a piece written by Gloria Steinem and reprinted in her 1983 book &quot;Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions&quot;. The article featured a photo of Steinem in Bunny uniform and detailed how women were treated at those clubs. The article was published in 1963 in &quot;Show&quot; magazine as &quot;A Bunny&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Steinem has maintained that she is proud of the work she did publicizing the exploitative working conditions of the Bunnies and especially the sexual demands made of them, which skirted the edge of the law.

Clive James wrote of the &quot;callous fatuity of the selection process&quot; and observed that &quot;to make it as a Bunny, a girl need[ed] more than just looks. She need[ed] idiocy, too.&quot;

=== International icon ===

The costume of a Playboy Bunny gained huge popularity in Japan, where it has lost much of its association with Playboy and is accordingly referred to simply as the or . It has frequently been featured in manga and anime; notable examples of characters who have been depicted wearing it include the title character of &quot;Haruhi Suzumiya&quot;, Kallen Stadtfeld of &quot;Code Geass&quot;, Bulma of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, Haruko Haruhara of &quot;FLCL&quot;, and the unnamed protagonist of the &quot;Daicon III&quot; and &quot;Daicon IV Opening Animations&quot;. The outfit is alluded to in the title of the series &quot;Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai&quot;, and the character Mai Sakurajima is seen wearing one in its first episode. The suit is also popularly depicted in anime and manga fan art and merchandise, even for characters who are never seen wearing it in official works. Bunny suits are most frequently worn by female characters, but they are occasionally worn by male characters, usually for comedic effect.

There are no Playboy Clubs in Brazil, but Playboy&#x27;s Brazilian division has Bunnies who attend its events. For most of the 2000s there were three official Bunnies, and they were also Playmates — both separately, and together in the cover pictorial for the December 2008 edition. The last printed issue of the magazine, in 2018, featured the five Bunnies of the period on the cover.

Playboy Bunnies are a separate entity from Playboy Playmates, women who appear in the centerfold pictorials of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, however, a few Playboy Bunnies went on to become Playmates and vice versa (see below).

== Return of the Bunnies ==
In 2006, The Palms Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas opened the first new Playboy Club in over a quarter-century, located on the 52nd floor of the Fantasy Tower. Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli was chosen to re-design the original Bunny suit. It closed in 2012.

<text>The RPK-2 Vyuga (, &quot;blizzard&quot;; NATO reporting name: SS-N-15 Starfish), also designated as 81R, is a Soviet submarine-launched, nuclear-armed anti-submarine missile system, launched exclusively through torpedo tubes. The system was designed in Sverdlovsk, Russian SFSR in the 1960s.

Analogous to the SUBROC missile previously used by the US Navy, it is designed to be fired from a 533 mm torpedo tube. It is boosted by a choice of mechanisms depending on model before clearing the water, firing a solid fuel rocket and delivering its payload up to away. The payload ranges from a simple depth charge to a 200 kt nuclear depth bomb.

==Design==
The RPK-2 uses a 82R torpedo or 90R nuclear depth charge in the 533 mm version, and a 83R torpedo carrying or 86R nuclear depth charge in 650 mm version.

Both submarine- and surface-launched versions exist. The surface-launched versions are used by the , , and classes. The submarine-launched versions are used by the , , , , , and classes. However, the munition package used in either is identical and hence the ship-launched version is launched into the water and submerges before firing its engines.

<text>RPK-6 &quot;Vodopad&quot; (, &quot;waterfall&quot;) is a Soviet 533 mm anti-submarine missile deployed operationally since 1981.

RPK-7 &quot;Veter&quot; (, &quot;wind&quot;) is a 650 mm version, deployed operationally since 1984.

Both missiles are given the same United States Navy designation SS-N-16 and NATO designation Stallion.

Both missiles are torpedo-tube launched, with a solid-fuel rocket engine to power them above the surface. Both missiles are dual-role; they can be armed with either a 400 mm anti-submarine torpedo or a nuclear depth charge.

The Veter&#x27;s increased range of approximately 100 kilometers was an impressive boost over its predecessor the SS-N-15 Starfish, which could only reach half the distance.

<text>Benjamin Jekhowsky (; born 1881 in Saint-Petersburg, Russia – died in 1975, Encausse-les-Thermes,France) was a Russian-French astronomer, born in Saint-Petersburg in a noble family of a Russian railroad official.

After attending Moscow University, he worked at the Paris Observatory beginning in 1912. Later he worked at the Algiers Observatory (at the time, Algeria was a colony of France), where he became known as a specialist in celestial mechanics. After 1934, he appears to have begun signing scientific articles as Benjamin de Jekhowsky. The Minor Planet Center credits his discoveries under the name &quot;B. Jekhovsky&quot; (with a &quot;v&quot;). In modern English transliteration, his name would be written as Zhekhovskii or Zhekhovsky.

He discovered 12 numbered minor planets, made more than 190 scientific publications and the asteroid 1606 Jekhovsky is named after him.

<text>Boris Mikhaylovich Shaposhnikov () ( – 26 March 1945) was a Soviet military officer, theoretician and Marshal of the Soviet Union. He served as the Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces from 1928 to 1931 and at the start of the Second World War. Shaposhnikov was one of the foremost military theorists during the Stalin-era. His most important work, &quot;Mozg Armii&quot; (&quot;The Brain of the Army&quot;), is considered a landmark in Soviet military theory and doctrine on the organization of the Red Army&#x27;s General Staff.

Born to a family of Orenburg Cossack origins in Zlatoust in the Urals, Shaposhnikov was a graduate of the Nicholas General Staff Academy and served in the Imperial Russian Army, reaching the rank of colonel during the First World War. He supported the Russian Revolution and later joined the Red Army, but did not become a member of the Communist Party until 1939. He was Chief of the Staff of the Red Army from 1928 to 1931, followed by a stint as commandant of the Frunze Military Academy. In 1937, he was appointed to the newly created title of Chief of the General Staff. In 1940, he was named a Marshal of the Soviet Union.

Shaposhnikov resigned as Chief of the General Staff following Soviet failures during the Winter War in Finland. He was reappointed to the position following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, replacing Georgy Zhukov, but was again forced to resign a year later due to declining health. He then held the post of commandant of the Academy of the General Staff, and remained an influential and respected advisor to Stalin until his death in 1945.

==Biography==

Shaposhnikov, born at Zlatoust, near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, had Orenburg Cossack origins. He joined the army of the Russian Empire in 1901 as an officer cadet, and graduated from the Nicholas General Staff Academy in 1910, reaching the rank of colonel in the Caucasus Grenadiers division in September 1917 during World War I. Also in 1917, unusually for an officer of his rank, he supported the Russian Revolution, and in May 1918 joined the Red Army.

Shaposhnikov was one of the few Red Army commanders with formal pre-revolutionary military training, and in 1921 he became 1st Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army&#x27;s General Staff, where he served until 1925. He was appointed commander of the Leningrad Military District in 1925 and then of the Moscow Military District in 1927. From 1928 to 1931 he served as Chief of the Staff of the Red Army, replacing Mikhail Tukhachevsky, with whom he had a strained relationship. He was then demoted to command of the Volga Military District from April 1931 to 1932 as a result of slanderous accusations (made by an arrested staff-officer) of belonging to a clandestine organization. In 1932 he was appointed commandant of the Red Army&#x27;s Frunze Military Academy, then in 1935 he returned to the command of the Leningrad region. In 1937 he was appointed as Chief of the General Staff, in succession to Alexander Ilyich Yegorov, a defendant of the Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization secret trial during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of the Red Army. In May 1940 he was appointed a Marshal of the Soviet Union.

Despite his background as a Tsarist officer, Shaposhnikov won the respect and trust of Stalin. Due to his status as a professional officer, he did not join the Communist Party until 1939. This may have helped him avoid Stalin&#x27;s suspicions. The price he paid for his survival during the purges was collaboration in the destruction of Tukhachevsky and of many other colleagues. Stalin showed his admiration for the officer by always keeping a copy of Shaposhnikov&#x27;s most important work, &quot;Mozg Armii&quot; (Мозг армии, &quot;The Brain of the Army&quot;) (1929), on his desk. Shaposhnikov was one of the few men whom Stalin addressed by his Christian name and patronymic. &quot;Mozg Armii&quot; has remained on the curriculum of the General Staff Academy since its publication in 1929.

Fortunately for the Soviet Union, Shaposhnikov had a fine military mind and high administrative skills. He combined these talents with his position in Stalin&#x27;s confidence to rebuild the Red Army&#x27;s leadership cadres after the purges. He obtained the release from the Gulag of 4,000 officers deemed necessary for this operation. In 1939 Stalin accepted Shaposhnikov&#x27;s plan for a rapid buildup of the Red Army&#x27;s strength. Although the planned changes remained incomplete at the time of the Axis invasion of June 1941, they had advanced sufficiently to save the Soviet Union from complete disaster.
Shaposhnikov planned the 1939 Soviet invasion of Finland, but was much less optimistic about its duration than Stalin and the campaign&#x27;s commander Kliment Voroshilov. The resultant Winter War (1939–1940) did not deliver the immediate success the Soviet side had hoped for, and Shaposhnikov resigned as Chief of the General Staff in August 1940, due to ill-health and to disagreements with Stalin about the conduct of that campaign. Following the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, he was reinstated (29 July 1941) as Chief of the General Staff to succeed Georgy Zhukov, and also became Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for Defence, the post he held until his career was cut short by ill-health in 1943. He resigned again as Chief of the General Staff due to ill-health on 10 May 1942. He held the position of commandant of the Voroshilov Military Academy until his death in 1945 at the age of 62. Shaposhnikov had groomed his successor as Chief of Staff, Aleksandr Vasilevsky, and remained an influential and respected advisor to Stalin until his death. His ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

<doc id="621625" wikidata="Q1062587" url="?curid=621625" title="N'Ko script">
<text>NKo (ߒߞߏ), also spelled N&#x27;Ko, is an alphabetic script devised by Solomana Kanté in 1949, as a modern writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa. The term &quot;NKo&quot;, which means &quot;I say&quot; in all Manding languages, is also used for the Manding literary standard written in the NKo script.

The script has a few similarities to the Arabic script, notably its direction (right-to-left) and the letters that are connected at the base. Unlike Arabic, it is obligatory to mark both tone and vowels. NKo tones are marked as diacritics.

==History==
Kanté created N’Ko in response to erroneous beliefs that no indigenous African writing system existed, as well as to provide a better way to write Manding languages, which had for centuries been written predominantly in Ajami script, which was not perfectly suited to the tones unique to Mandé and common to other West African languages. An anecdote popular with N&#x27;Ko proponents is that Kanté was particularly challenged to create the distinct system when, while in Bouake, he found a book by a Lebanese author who dismissed African languages as “like those of the birds, impossible to transcribe” despite said Ajami history. Kanté then devised N’Ko while he was in Bingerville, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and later brought it to his native Kankan, Guinea.

N’Ko began to be used in many educational books, and the script is believed to have been finalized on April 14, 1949 – a date now celebrated as N’Ko Alphabet Day. Kanté initially used the system to transcribe religious, scientific, and philosophical literature, and even a dictionary. These texts were then distributed as gifts across the Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. The script received its first dedicated typewriter from Eastern Europe as Guinea had ties to the Soviet Union in the 1950s.

This introduction of the script led to a movement promoting N’Ko literacy among Mandé speakers in both Anglophone and Francophone West Africa. N’Ko literacy was thus instrumental in shaping Maninka cultural identity in Guinea, and strengthened Manding identity in wider West Africa.

On June 27, 2024, the N’Ko literary standard was added to Google Translate.

==Current use==

As of 2005, it was used mainly in Guinea and the Ivory Coast (respectively by Maninka and Dyula speakers), with an active user community in Mali (by Bambara speakers). Publications include a translation of the Quran, a variety of textbooks on subjects such as physics and geography, poetic and philosophical works, descriptions of traditional medicine, a dictionary, and several local newspapers. Though taught mostly informally through NKo literacy promotion associations, NKo has also been introduced more recently into formal education through private primary schools in Upper Guinea. It has been classed as the most successful of the West African scripts.

NKo literature generally uses a literary language register, termed &quot;kangbe&quot; (literally, &#x27;clear language&#x27;), that is seen as a potential compromise dialect across Mandé languages. For example, the word for &#x27;name&#x27; in Bamanan is &quot;tɔgɔ&quot; and in Maninka it is &quot;tɔɔ&quot;. NKo has only one written word for &#x27;name&#x27;, but individuals read and pronounce the word in their own language. This literary register is thus intended as a koiné language blending elements of the principal Manding languages, which are mutually intelligible, but has a very strong Maninka influence.

There has also been documented use of NKo, with additional diacritics, for traditional religious publications in the Yoruba and Fon languages of Benin and southwestern Nigeria.

==Letters==
The NKo script is written from right to left, with letters being connected to one another.

===Vowels===
===Consonants===
===Tones===
NKo uses 7 diacritical marks to denote tonality and vowel length. Together with plain vowels, NKo distinguishes four tones: high, low, ascending, and descending; and two vowel lengths: long and short. Unmarked signs designate short, descending vowels.

===Non-native sounds and letters===

NKo also provides a way of representing non-native sounds through the modification of its letters with diacritics. These letters are used in transliterated names and loanwords.

Two dots above a vowel, resembling a diaeresis or umlaut mark, represent a foreign vowel: u-two-dots for the French /y/ sound, or e-two-dots for the French /ə/.

Diacritics are also placed above some consonant letters to cover sounds not found in Mandé, such as gb-dot for /g/; gb-line for /ɣ/; gb-two-dots for /k͡p/; f-dot for /v/; rr-dot for /ʁ/; etc.

== Numerals ==
NKo numerals use positional notation. Unlike both Western and Eastern Arabic numerals, digits decrease in significance from right to left.
==Punctuation==
* ⸜...⸝ bracket paraphrased text, approximately equivalent to italics in Latin script.
* «...» bracket quoted text.
* comma
* exclamation mark 
* paragraph mark; marks the end of a section of text
* apostrophe (elision of a vowel carrying a high tone)
* apostrophe (elision of a vowel carrying a low tone)

A low hyphen is used for compound words and the ASCII hyphen is used for splitting words at line breaks. There is no distinct computer character for the low hyphen; Unicode recommends using the non-breaking hyphen for that purpose. 
Arabic punctuation marks used in Nko text include:
* comma (may occur in the same text as )
* semicolon
* question mark
* ornate parentheses (graphic form may differ from Arabic)

==Digitization==
With the increasing use of computers and the subsequent desire to provide universal access to information technology, the challenge arose of developing ways to use the NKo script on computers. From the 1990s onwards, there were efforts to develop fonts and even web content by adapting other software and fonts. A DOS word processor named Koma Kuda was developed by Prof. Baba Mamadi Diané from Cairo University. However the lack of intercompatibility inherent in such solutions was a block to further development.

===Wikipedia===
There is also a NKo version of Wikipedia in existence since 26 November 2019, it contains articles, with edits and users.

==Unicode==
The NKo script was added to the Unicode Standard in July 2006 with the release of version 5.0. Additional characters were added in 2018.

UNESCO&#x27;s Programme Initiative B@bel supported preparing a proposal to encode NKo in Unicode. In 2004, the proposal, presented by three professors of NKo (Baba Mamadi Diané, Mamady Doumbouya, and Karamo Kaba Jammeh) working with Michael Everson, was approved for balloting by the ISO working group WG2. In 2006, NKo was approved for Unicode 5.0. The Unicode block for NKo is U+07C0–U+07FF:

<doc id="621628" wikidata="Q886568" url="?curid=621628" title="Blood money (restitution)">
<text>Blood money, also called bloodwit, is money or some sort of compensation paid by an offender, usually a murderer, or their family group, to the family or kin group of the victim.

==Particular examples and uses==
Blood money is, colloquially, the reward for bringing a criminal to justice. A common meaning in other contexts is the money-penalty paid by a murderer to the kinsfolk of the victim. These fines completely protect the offender, or the kinsfolk thereof, from the vengeance of the injured family. The weregild compensation system was common among Germanic peoples as part of Ancient Germanic law, before the introduction of Christianity.

A scale of payments, graduated according to the heinousness of the crime, was fixed by laws, which further settled who could exact the blood-money, and who were entitled to share it. Homicide was not the only crime expiable: blood-money could be exacted for most crimes of violence. Some acts, such as killing someone in a church or while asleep, or within the precincts of the royal palace, and corporal infamy (rape) were &quot;bot-less&quot;. The death penalty was inflicted instead. Such a criminal was outlawed, and could be killed on sight or thrown into a bog in case of rape, according to Tacitus.

===In Islam===

In Islamic terms, Qisas can in some cases result in blood money being paid out to the family of victims. The amount varies from country to country and from case to case.

===In Judaism===
As a person&#x27;s life is considered as being the property of God, Judaism forbids the taking of blood-money for the life of a murdered victim.

===In Japan===
In Japanese culture it is common to give blood money, or &quot;mimaikin&quot;, to a victim&#x27;s family. Such was the case with Lucie Blackman&#x27;s father, who accepted £450,000 as blood money for the murder of his daughter.

===In Korea===
Under the Korean legal system, it is common for those accused of both minor (such as defamation) and serious crimes to offer blood money (&quot;habuigeum&quot;, 합의금(合意金)) to the victim. If accepted, then the perpetrator is usually excused from further punishment. Despite being common practice, its use in high-profile cases sometimes results in protests.

==Other meanings or uses==

===In Christianity===
In the Christian Bible, the term is used to refer to the thirty pieces of silver Judas Iscariot received, in exchange for revealing the identity of Jesus Christ to the forces sent by the Pharisees and/or the Sanhedrin. After the crucifixion of Christ, Judas returned the payment to the chief priests, who &quot;took the silver pieces and said, &#x27;It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.&#x27;&quot;

=== In shipping ===
&quot;Shanghaiing&quot; was the practice of the forced conscription of sailors. Boarding masters, whose job it was to find crews for ships, were paid &quot;by the body,&quot; and thus had a strong incentive to place as many seamen on ships as possible. This pay was called blood money.

<doc id="621632" wikidata="Q1937385" url="?curid=621632" title="Quinten Hann">
<text>Quinten Hann (born 4 June 1977) is an Australian former professional pool and snooker player. He was the 1999 WEPF World Eight-ball Champion and the 1994 IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Champion. His highest snooker was a 141 which he made at the 1997 Grand Prix tournament. In February 2006, he was banned from pro snooker for eight years for match-fixing at the 2005 China Open, shortly before which he had resigned his membership of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).

==Biography==

===Early life and amateur career===
Born on 4 June 1977 in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, Hann is the only child in a single-parent family. His father was absent from his life after his parents separated while the family was in Melbourne. He attended Redden Catholic College. When he turned nine, Hann&#x27;s mother Amanda purchased a snooker table for him to practise the game. He later took up pool at the age of ten after being introduced to it through a friend in Brisbane. Hann played pool during the weekends, until his mother swayed him away from playing in public houses. She telephoned a snooker coach to teach her son the game.

In June 1989, at age 12, Hann became the youngest qualifier for the Australian men&#x27;s open snooker championship, only losing in the last 16 stage to the Under-21 national champion Steve Mifsud. Although he broke his left wrist in a motorcycle accident which caused him to play in a plaster cast, he won the Victoria Under-12 Championship in March 1990. Three months later, Hann finished runner-up in his group at the 1990 IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship. But with six victories from eight matches, Hann did not qualify for the following rounds due to percentage. Hann&#x27;s mother sold the family&#x27;s home, car, and some other possessions to finance her son&#x27;s career, and the family moved from Wagga Wagga to England in late 1989. She wrote to Matchroom Sport founder Barry Hearn, who offered his services to Hann.

At the age of 13, Hann compiled his first century break (a 103) in a match against Melbourne Senior Champion Garry Cullen. He later produced a break of 100 at the 1991 World Masters under-16 tournament, making him the youngest player to compile a televised century break. He reached the final of the Australian Amateur Championship at age 14 and he then took part in the IBSF World Snooker Championship. On 13 October 1991, Hann was given a suspended ban by the Australian Billiards and Snooker Council from all domestic and overseas competitions for spitting on a competitor&#x27;s mother. This was invoked after the New South Wales country junior championship in January 1993 when he swore at the referee following a decision that favoured his opponent and entered the Lithgow Workmen&#x27;s Club licensed poker-machine area. Hann&#x27;s family appealed the ban to the High Court of Australia, and it was reduced to one year. In the meantime, he won the 1992 Australian Open 8-ball Championship, defeating Lou Condo 6–1 in the final and later beat David Gray 11–10 to win the 1994 IBSF World Under-21 Championship.

===Professional career===
Hann became a professional player in 1995. Within five months of the start of his first season, he reached No. 237 in the world by competing in satellite tournaments. Not discouraged by this, he met Brandon Parker through another player and Parker agreed to manage Hann&#x27;s career. Hann was now able to enter tournaments abroad in the 1996–97 season, reaching the quarter-finals of the 1997 Thailand Open, and rising to No. 104 in the world. In 1996, he was paired with Robby Foldvari and Stan Gorski to represent Australia at the Snooker World Cup. The trio lasted until the quarter-finals, being defeated 5–10 by England.

For the 1997–98 season, Hann reached the televised stages of more tournaments, lasting until the second-rounds of the Grand Prix (where he set a record of 13 consecutive victories with a 5–4 margin and compiled the highest break of his career, a 141), the UK Championship, and the German Open tournaments. He lost in the first round of the preliminary stages of the British Open with a 5–0 whitewash to Drew Henry in April 1998. One month earlier, Hann became the first Australian player since Eddie Charlton in 1992 to qualify for the World Snooker Championship. He was eliminated by Mark Williams 9–10 in the first round, ending the season ranked No. 45 in the world.

Hann won the Lindrum Masters multi-format tournament in Newcastle, New South Wales in September 1998. After the tournament, he met with his mother and World Snooker chairman Rex Williams, and agreed to change his lifestyle and public image. Hann advanced to the quarter-finals of the Grand Prix tournament in the following month, losing to Stephen Lee in a 5–0 whitewash. He lost 5–9 to Marcus Campbell in the second round of the UK Championship in November; Hann&#x27;s opponent criticised him for conceding two frames in the match. Hann replicated this performance once more during the season, this time in the Scottish Open in February 1999, losing 2–5 to Graeme Dott. He concluded the season ranked No. 26 in the world.

Before the start of the 1999–2000 snooker season, Hann won the WEPF World Eightball Championship to become the only player born outside the United Kingdom and Ireland to claim the title, and defeated Oliver Ortmann to successfully defend the Lindrum Masters tournament in August. He qualified for the British Open in September, lasting until the second round when he was defeated 2–5 by Stephen Lee. In October Hann withdrew from the Grand Prix as his father suffered a myocardial infarction, then withdrew from the Australian Nine-Ball Championship to pursue riding motorcycles as a hobby. While doing this, he sustained a clavicle fracture and a bruised wrist in an accident in Melbourne, which left him unable to play in the next six tournaments. Hann returned to competition at the Scottish Open in March 2000, reaching the second-round where he lost 4–5 to eventual champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

Hann began the 2000–01 season ranked world No. 32. Hann prepared for the upcoming campaign by increasing his practise at his home in Melbourne. Before that Hann lasted until the semi-final stage of the WEPF World Eightball Championship in June 2000. Hann was eliminated from the second round at the Grand Prix tournament, and was booed by spectators for smashing the cue ball into the pack of in the final three frames of his match against O&#x27;Sullivan. He earned an official reprimand of £750 for &quot;unprofessional behaviour&quot; for nonperformance.

Hann broke a bone in his foot in a parachute jump before the 2000 UK Championship, and was required to play shoeless in a tournament, in which he lasted until the quarter-finals. He also reached the quarter-finals of the Thailand Masters before losing to John Parrott. Hann qualified for the 2001 World Snooker Championship and was drawn against world number 16 Dave Harold in the first round. The match saw Hann lose 5–10 to Harold.

He commenced the 2001/2002 season as the world number 25. Hann reached the second round of the season&#x27;s first three ranking tournaments, before improving his performance to last until the third round of the China Open and the Thailand Masters. Later in 2002, he progressed beyond the third round of the Scottish Open ensuring that he would end the season as one of the world&#x27;s top sixteen ranked players, making him the first Australian player to do so since Eddie Charlton in 1986. Hann ended the tournament in the quarter-final stage and critiqued the World Snooker Association&#x27;s running of snooker. He concluded the season in the second round of the World Snooker Championship with a victory over Paul Hunter in the first round and a loss to Stephen Lee in the next stage. Players and pundits criticised Hann for breaking up the red balls in a pool-style method during both of his matches and for unprofessional-ism in the second game.

The 2002/2003 season saw Hann ranked 14th in the world. He was unable to win a match in the season&#x27;s first four ranking tournaments. Hann&#x27;s top sixteen world ranking allowed him to enter the non-ranking Masters tournament for the first time in his professional career, which he lost in the first round 4–6 to Lee. This marked a turning point in his season as he reached the second round of the next two competitions and the quarter-finals of the 2003 Irish Masters. At the World Snooker Championship, Hann defeated Parrott 10–5 in the first round, before he was defeated by Mark Williams 13–2 in the second round.

He retained his ranking of 14th in the world for the 2003/2004 season. Hann moved to Ealing after the 2003 World Championship and began practising regularly at Ealing Snooker Club in a bid to establish himself as one of the world&#x27;s top 16 players. He got through to the quarter-finals of the UK Championship for the first time, where he played Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. He lost the match 3–9. At the 2004 Masters, Hann was defeated in the first round 3–6 by Peter Ebdon. He later progressed to the quarter-finals of the European Open in Malta and lost to local player Tony Drago 1–5. Hann progressed into the first ranking semi-final of his professional career at the Irish Masters. This made him the first Australian player to reach the semi-finals of a tournament since Warren King at the 1990 Classic. Hann conceded a frame while 30–24 ahead and executed a pool-style break off in his 5–6 defeat to Ebdon.

His final match of the season was a 4–10 defeat to Andy Hicks in the first round of the World Snooker Championship. After the match, referee Lawrie Annandale separated the two players from a physical alteration after Hann made a threatening comment to Hicks when the latter suggested he would lose his top 16 world ranking. He challenged Hicks to a fight; In the event fellow snooker player Mark King stood in for Hicks at a charity boxing match with Hann which the latter won. Hann also fought Dublin GAA player, Johnny Magee, in a charity boxing match in Dublin in September 2004 after he suggested that Gaelic footballers were not as robust as Australia rules footballers. He had his nose broken, with Magee winning in three rounds.

Hann fell to 18th in the world rankings before the commencement of the 2004/2005 season. He reached the quarter finals of the 2004 World 8-Ball Championship and lost 6–9 to Darren Appleton. Hann withdrew from the 2005 Malta Cup due to a fractured finger. The 2005 World Championship saw Hann forced to play with a new cue after his original cue was lost after the China Open earlier that year. The original cue was eventually retrieved just before the World Championship but was damaged and unusable. He borrowed a friend&#x27;s cue and decided against practising, and instead went out drinking. He played his first round match against Peter Ebdon hungover, and lost 2–10. Hann ended the season 22nd in the world rankings.

===Match-fixing allegations and resignation===
The day after his 2005 sex attack acquittal &quot;The Sun&quot; alleged that Hann agreed to lose his opening match against the 1997 world champion Ken Doherty at the China Open to one of its undercover reporters in return for £50,000. The story was held back to avoid prejudice in the outcome of Hann&#x27;s trial. A hearing at the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) was convened after its panel was shown transcripts of video and audio footage of the meetings which took place between Hann and the undercover &quot;Sun&quot; journalists in March and April 2005. In September, he entered the Grand Prix tournament, before he withdrew one month later on medical grounds. Hann submitted a medical certificate and received a £3,000 prize fund from the WPBSA. Hann later failed to attend the first round of the UK Championship for undisclosed reasons.

On 14 February 2006 he resigned from the WPBSA. Hann did not attend the hearing and was found guilty &quot;in absentia&quot;. The newspaper did not go through with any agreement, but by agreeing to lose the game Hann was in breach of rule 2.8, which states &quot;a member shall not directly or indirectly solicit, attempt to solicit or accept any payment or any form of remuneration of benefit in exchange for influencing the outcome of any game of snooker or billiards.&quot; Hann was banned from snooker until 2014 and also fined £10,000. He commented on the ban imposed on him in an interview with the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; in 2010, &quot;I was just the perfect scapegoat for them. I was a foreigner, I&#x27;d pretty much given up snooker and so I was fair game for them.&quot;

==Legal issues==
In October 2001, Hann invited an unidentified South African born woman to a hotel in London after midnight. Both were drinking alcohol at a club bar in the West End and began kissing. The woman allowed Hann to remove her lower clothing. Hann&#x27;s accuser alleged that he then forced himself upon her. Police later arrested Hann and charged him with rape. He was instructed to surrender his travel documents and a Magistrates&#x27; Court judge allowed him to keep playing professional snooker as long as he told the police where he was residing. Hann appeared in Southwark Crown Court on 3 January 2002 and entered a plea of not guilty. He was acquitted of the charges by a jury in July 2002.

Hann was cleared of further sex attacks on two women in 2005. The women accused Hann of behaving like a &quot;crazed animal&quot; and said that they thought they were going to die. One of them claimed that he repeatedly struck her, an accusation that Hann strongly denied explaining that his mother had taught him to never raise a hand to a woman. Ultimately the case turned on the credibility of his accuser, which was undermined when it was admitted she had lied consistently under oath throughout the trial.

In October 2014, it was reported that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) started court proceedings at the Federal Court of Australia against Hann (now going under the name Quinten Hunter), general manager of broker Monarch FX (Monarch FX Group Pty Ltd). ASIC temporarily banned Monarch FX and Hann from offering financial services until November 2014 when the hearing resumed. In 2016, Hann was banned from the financial services industry for four years.

<doc id="621661" wikidata="Q2989836" url="?curid=621661" title="The Edge of Destruction">
<text>The Edge of Destruction (also referred to as Inside the Spaceship) is the third serial of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was written by David Whitaker, and first broadcast on BBC TV in two weekly parts on 8 February and 15 February 1964. The first episode was directed by Richard Martin, while Frank Cox directed the second. In the story, the Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) are in the Doctor&#x27;s time and space machine the TARDIS when it appears to be taken over by an outside force. The travellers begin acting strangely and turn against each other.

The serial was commissioned as a &quot;filler&quot;, in case the show was not renewed beyond the approved 13 weeks. Whitaker wrote the scripts in two days, based on an idea he had developed during the show&#x27;s formative weeks; he sought to explore the characters in more depth, as well as the facets of the TARDIS. The serial&#x27;s original director, Paddy Russell, left the project due to other commitments. The serial premiered with ten million viewers, maintaining the figures from the previous story, and received generally positive responses. The BBC Programme Board voiced concerns regarding a scene in which Susan uses scissors as a weapon, noting that it violated code. The serial received print adaptations, as well as home media releases.

== Plot ==
The First Doctor (William Hartnell), while attempting to correct the TARDIS&#x27;s faulty navigation circuits, causes a small explosion. The Doctor, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), and Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) are all temporarily rendered unconscious. When they wake, Ian and Susan appear to have slight cases of amnesia and everyone begins to act strangely. The travellers are becoming suspicious of each other&#x27;s motives, and the Doctor accuses Ian and Barbara of sabotage. Fearing that they have been taken over by some alien force—or that they have intentionally sabotaged the TARDIS to force the Doctor to return them to 1963—he drugs Barbara and Ian, unknowing that Ian is also suspicious and has not taken the drink given to him. The Doctor attempts to explore the problem without interference.

Gradually it becomes clear that the strange events are an attempt by the TARDIS itself to warn the crew that something is wrong. Barbara&#x27;s clue gathering forces the Doctor to trace the problem to a broken spring in the Fast Return Switch. The malfunction is causing the TARDIS to head back to the beginning of time; the strange events were just attempts by the TARDIS to warn the passengers before the ship is destroyed. Fixing the switch brings all back to normal. Although the day is saved, Barbara is still affected by the Doctor&#x27;s harsh words earlier. The Doctor admits he was wrong about Barbara and Ian. The story closes with the TARDIS materialising on a snowy landscape, where Susan spots a giant footprint in the snow.

== Production ==
=== Conception and writing ===
On 16 October 1963, BBC TV&#x27;s Controller of Programmes Donald Baverstock indicated that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was only confirmed as a 13-episode show at the time, due to budgetary information. There were already several serials planned at this point, namely the four-part &quot;Doctor Who and the Tribe of Gum&quot; (later &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;), followed by the seven-part &quot;The Mutants&quot; (later &quot;The Daleks&quot;), and the seven-part &quot;A Journey to Cathay&quot; (later &quot;Marco Polo&quot;); as a result, a new two-episode &quot;filler&quot; serial was required, in case the show was not renewed further. On 1 November, the serial was assigned to story editor David Whitaker to write, and Paddy Russell to direct. Since the serial had no budget and minimal resources, Whitaker took the opportunity to develop an idea conceived during the show&#x27;s formative weeks: a character-driven story exploring the facets of the TARDIS. 

Whitaker wrote the script in two days, describing the process as &quot;a bit of a nightmare&quot;. He drew upon influences of ghost stories and haunted houses, and producer Verity Lambert felt that the story captured audiences because of the conflict between the characters. To avoid complication with the Writers&#x27; Guild, Whitaker only received a writing credit for the serial, omitting his usual credit of story editor. When filming for the serial was deferred for a week due to issues with the previous serial, Russell left the project due to other commitments, temporarily replaced by associate producer Mervyn Pinfield; junior director Richard Martin was later handed the role. Frank Cox directed the second episode, as Martin was unavailable. Raymond Cusick designed the extra rooms in the TARDIS. Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop designed the serial&#x27;s sounds, while the music was selected from a range of sample mood music from library discs, due to budgetary constraints.

=== Filming ===
Rehearsals for the first episode began on 13 January 1964, and it was recorded on 17 January in Lime Grove Studios, Studio D. William Hartnell initially complained about the script due to the number of lines, while Carole Ann Ford was sceptical of the characters appearing mad without reason; conversely, Jacqueline Hill and William Russell appreciated the chance to explore their characters in more depth. The second episode&#x27;s rehearsals ran from 20–23 January, and recording took place on 24 January. The serial cost a total of £1,480, far less than the £2,500 granted for each episode. The Fast Return Switch label on the TARDIS console appears to be written in felt-tip pen; Cusick guessed it was written during rehearsals as a guide, while Lambert surmised it may have been written so Hartnell could find the switch, and both agreed it was probably never intended to be seen. Ford stated she and Hartnell labelled controls on the TARDIS control panel during rehearsal, and assumed they would be blotted out before production.

== Reception ==
=== Broadcast and ratings ===

The first episode was broadcast on BBC TV 8 February 1964, and was watched by 10.4 million viewers, retaining the high viewing figures from the previous episode. The second episode&#x27;s broadcast on 15 February received slightly lower ratings, with 9.9 million viewers. The two episodes received an Appreciation Index of 61 and 60, indicating positive audience response.

=== Critical response ===
At a BBC Programme Review Board Meeting in February 1964, controller of television programmes Stuart Hood felt that the serial&#x27;s sequences in which Susan uses scissors as a weapon &quot;digressed from the code of violence in programmes&quot;; Lambert apologised for the scenes. In &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote that the story &quot;manages to flesh out the central figures at the expense of the plot&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker considered the second episode superior to the first and, noting the serial&#x27;s origins as a &quot;filler&quot;, noted that it &quot;works remarkably well&quot;. In &quot;A Critical History of Doctor Who&quot; (1999), John Kenneth Muir praised the serial&#x27;s exploration of its characters&#x27; relationships, an element that the show would eventually lose after the departure of Russell and Hill. In a 2008 review, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; described Whitaker as &quot;a master of dialogue, characterisation and atmosphere&quot;, but felt he struggled with plot logic, as evidenced by the fast return switch explanation. Despite this, he stated that the ending had &quot;charm&quot; as the TARDIS travellers began to become friends. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott felt that &quot;The Edge of Destruction&quot; was the weakest of the show&#x27;s first three serials, writing that it had &quot;some good moments&quot; but &quot;overall it doesn&#x27;t hang together quite as well&quot; as the preceding two stories; he commented that it felt &quot;rushed&quot; and the resolution was a &quot;cop-out&quot;. The serial was recommended by Charlie Jane Anders of &quot;io9&quot; as an example of the classic series for new viewers to watch, describing it as &quot;a quick hit ... and still just as intense as it was&quot;.

== Commercial releases ==
===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Nigel Robinson, was published in hardback in May 1988, with a cover painting by Alister Pearson; the paperback was published by Target Books on 20 October 1988. Since Whitaker died before novelising his scripts, Robinson considerably expanded the serial for the book. An audiobook reading of the novelisation, narrated by William Russell, was published by BBC Audiobooks on CD on 31 August 2010. 

===Home media===
An extract from the second episode, dubbed in Arabic, was included on the VHS release &quot;Doctor Who: The Hartnell Years&quot; in June 1991. The full story was first released on VHS in May 2000, alongside the pilot episode of &quot;An Unearthly Child&quot;. For the DVD release on 30 January 2006, the serial was released as part of &quot;Doctor Who: The Beginning&quot; alongside the preceding two stories, with several special features. An audio version of the serial, with linking narration by Ford, was released as a vinyl record by Demon Records on 2 May 2024, as part of Record Store Day.

<doc id="621672" wikidata="Q2149722" url="?curid=621672" title="Richard Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth">
<text>Richard Douglas Harries, Baron Harries of Pentregarth, (born 2 June 1936) is a retired bishop of the Church of England and former British Army officer. He was the Bishop of Oxford from 1987 to 2006. From 2008 until 2012 he was the Gresham Professor of Divinity.

==Education and army career==
Harries was educated at Wellington College and Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Corps of Signals on 16 December 1955 and was promoted to lieutenant two years later. He left the active Regular Army on 12 September 1958 (transferring to the reserve of officers), and went to Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he studied theology (BA 1961, MA 1965), before going on to Cuddesdon College (1961–63) to study for ordination. He formally resigned his original army commission on 18 March 1965, but was immediately recommissioned as Chaplain to the Forces 4th Class in the Territorial Army; on 29 October 1969 he once more transferred to the reserve.

==Church ministry==
Harries was made deacon in 1963, becoming assistant curate of Hampstead St John in the Diocese of London (1963–69). He was ordained priest the following year and later combined his ministry at St John&#x27;s with the chaplaincy of the former Westfield College (now part of Queen Mary, University of London) (1967–69). He became a tutor at Wells Theological College (1969–71) and was then warden of the new Salisbury and Wells Theological College (1971–72).

He returned to parish ministry as vicar of All Saints&#x27;, Fulham (1972–1981) and returned to academia as Dean of King&#x27;s College London (1981–1987). He was appointed Bishop of Oxford in 1987, being consecrated on 28 May at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral by Robert Runcie, Archbishop of Canterbury and taking a seat as a Lord Spiritual in the House of Lords in 1993. In 1999 he was appointed to the Royal Commission (chaired by John Wakeham) to investigate a possible reorganisation of the House of Lords, which produced the Wakeham Report. He retired on 2 June 2006, his 70th birthday.

In the week prior to his retirement, on 26 May 2006, Downing Street announced that he was to be made a life peer, and he was gazetted as Baron Harries of Pentregarth, of Ceinewydd in the County of Dyfed on 30 June 2006. He sits as a cross-bencher. On 4 August 2006, he was appointed to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved for a period of five years.

==Other activities==
In 1986, Harries took up a subsidiary appointment as consultant to the archbishops of Canterbury and York on inter-faith relations. As Bishop of Oxford he became a founder member of the Oxford Abrahamic Group, bringing together Christian, Muslim, and Jewish scholars. He chaired the Council of Christians and Jews from 1992 until 2001. In 1988 he was president of the Johnson Society, delivering a presidential address on &quot;Johnson – A Church of England Saint&quot;. He has been a member of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (including serving as chair of the HFEA Ethics and Law Committee) and a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, as well as chairing the House of Lords select committee on stem cell research. He was chairman of the Church of England Board for Social Responsibility (1996–2001) and chairman of the House of Bishops&#x27; Working Party on Issues in Human Sexuality and has served on the board of Christian Aid. He was also a member of the Royal Commission on the Reform of the House of Lords (the Wakeham Commission). A regular contributor to the &quot;Today&quot; programme on BBC Radio 4, including many appearances on &quot;Thought for the Day&quot;, he has published three books of radio talks. He is a patron of POWER International, a charity working with disabled people in poor countries.

Harries was a member of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics 2002–2008. In 2002 he was visiting professor at Liverpool Hope University College. In 2008 he replaced Keith Ward as the Gresham Professor of Divinity.

Harries insisted that there was no conflict between science and religion. He was critical of both outspoken atheists and creationists: &quot;From time to time, I see American creationist magazines with articles by people claiming to have doctorates in science. Judging religion only on the basis of its least credible examples is as though I judged all science on the basis of creationist science.&quot;

Harries currently serves as an Advisory Steering Group member for the Commission on Religion and Belief in British Public Life.

Harries is the author of 26 books on the interface of Christian faith and wider culture, including ethics, politics and the arts, especially the visual arts. These include &quot;The Passion in Art&quot; (Ashgate 2004) and &quot;Art and the Beauty of God&quot; (Continuum 2000), which was chosen as a book of the year by the Anthony Burgess in &quot;The Observer&quot; when it was originally published in 1993. &quot;The Re-Enchantment of Morality&quot; (SPCK 2008) was shortlisted for the 2011 Michael Ramsey prize for theological writing. &quot;The Image of Christ in Modern Art&quot; was published by Ashgate in October 2013.

Harries reviews books regularly for the &quot;Church Times&quot;.

==Legacy and reputation==
His passion for social justice influenced his liberal views. At the start of his episcopacy, he brought legal proceedings challenging the Church Commissioners&#x27; policy on investment. He and his co-plaintiffs argued that the Church Commissioners placed too much emphasis on purely financial considerations and insufficient emphasis upon the promotion of the Christian faith. Although this challenge failed – the Commissioners already had an ethical investment policy, albeit one which excluded a smaller part of the UK share market than the plaintiffs had wanted to exclude – the Court recognised that it was proper for charities to consider whether their investment strategies would alienate the charity&#x27;s financial supporters.

In 1996, Harries formed part of a working group of church leaders looking to address the increasing numbers of homeless in west London. Harries and the other original founders championed the need for an open-access shelter that welcomed all in need, regardless of local connection, religion or nationality. The group, formerly known as West London Churches Homeless Concern, gained charity status in 2000 and changed its name to &quot;Glass Door&quot; in 2014. It continues to operate church-based homeless shelters across central and south-west London.

In 2014, Harries stated in the House of Lords that the next British coronation in Westminster Abbey should feature readings from the Quran, the holy book of Islam.

On 11 February 2017, Harries was one of 14 retired bishops to sign an open letter to the then-serving bishops of the Church of England. In an unprecedented move, they expressed their opposition to the House of Bishops&#x27; report to General Synod on sexuality, which recommended no change to the church&#x27;s canons or practices around sexuality. By 13 February, a serving bishop (Alan Wilson, Bishop of Buckingham) and nine further retired bishops had added their signatures; on 15 February, the report was rejected by synod.

==Honours==
Harries was appointed a fellow of King&#x27;s College London (FKC) in 1983, a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1996, and an honorary fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2004. In 1994 he became a Doctor of Divinity &quot;honoris causa&quot; of the University of London and in 2001 he was honoured with the degree of Doctor of the University (DUniv) by Oxford Brookes University.

In 2012, he was awarded the President&#x27;s Medal by the British Academy.

In 2012, he was elected a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales.

<text>In mathematics, Cartan&#x27;s theorems A and B are two results proved by Henri Cartan around 1951, concerning a coherent sheaf on a Stein manifold . They are significant both as applied to several complex variables, and in the general development of sheaf cohomology.

Theorem B is stated in cohomological terms (a formulation that Cartan (1953, p. 51) attributes to J.-P. Serre):
Analogous properties were established by Serre (1957) for coherent sheaves in algebraic geometry, when is an affine scheme. The analogue of Theorem B in this context is as follows :
These theorems have many important applications. For instance, they imply that a holomorphic function on a closed complex submanifold, , of a Stein manifold can be extended to a holomorphic function on all of . At a deeper level, these theorems were used by Jean-Pierre Serre to prove the GAGA theorem.

Theorem B is sharp in the sense that if for all coherent sheaves on a complex manifold (resp. quasi-coherent sheaves on a noetherian scheme ), then is Stein (resp. affine); see (resp. and ).

<text>Alliance Healthcare, formerly Alliance UniChem, is a wholesaler, distributor and retailer of pharmaceutical, surgical, medical, and healthcare products throughout Europe. The company supplies more than 110,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centres, and hospitals from over 288 distribution centres in 11 countries.

The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, having been formerly owned by Walgreens Boots Alliance until 2021.
==History==
Stefano Pessina founded Alleanza Salute Italia in 1977 under the name of Alleanza Farmaceutica, which expanded to form Alliance Santé SA with Antonin De Bono (at that time Chairman and CEO (1994-97) of Européenne de répartition pharmaceutique et d&#x27;investissements which became Alliance Santé Distribution). In November 1997, Alliance Santé SA merged with UniChem PLC to form Alliance UniChem. The combined business became one of the largest pharmaceutical distributors in Europe. In 1998 it purchased a majority stake in the Spanish pharmaceutical wholesaler Grupo Safa.

In 1999, Alliance UniChem entered into a partnership with Galenica AG of Switzerland, and created the Alliance Farmacie business in Italy. Plus s.r.o. and Pragopharm s.r.o. of the Czech Republic were purchased that year, and Alliance Santè and UniChem&#x27;s Portuguese subsidiaries merged to form Alliance UniChem Farmacêutica S.A.

The company purchased the Dutch firms Interpharm and De Vier Vijzels in 2000. In 2001 the company entered into a strategic wholesale pharmaceutical partnership with the Turkish company Hedef Holding. In 2002, Alliance UniChem bought the Norwegian pharmaceutical wholesaler Holtung. The company entered the FTSE 100 index that year.

In 2003, Alliance UniChem bought a 40% indirect stake in the Egyptian wholesaler UCP via Hedef. The group launched the virtual pharmacy chain Alphega in France. The virtual chain was introduced in Italy the following year.

Alliance UniChem acquired Swiss specialist healthcare logistics and pre-wholesaler Alloga in 2005, as well as Spanish pharmaceutical wholesaler Farmacen, and the Bairds Chemist retail business in Northern Ireland. The UK retail pharmacy business was rebranded from &quot;Moss Pharmacy&quot; to &quot;Alliance Pharmacy&quot;.

On 3 October 2005 it was formally announced that Alliance UniChem would enter into a friendly merger with Boots Group, the UK&#x27;s largest retail pharmacy chain. The merger was completed on 31 July 2006, forming Alliance Boots. Alliance UniChem was renamed Alliance Healthcare in 2009, and in 2014 Alliance Boots was purchased by Walgreens, forming Walgreens Boots Alliance.

In June 2021 AmerisourceBergen acquired Alliance for $6.275 billion in cash.

<text>Zhang Yuzhe (; 16 February 1902 – 21 July 1986), also known as Yu-Che Chang, was a Chinese astronomer and director of the Purple Mountain Observatory who is widely regarded as the father of modern Chinese astronomy. He studied the light curves of asteroids, and thus their rotation periods. He also researched the variable star CZ Cassiopeiae and the evolution of the orbit of Comet Halley. Zhang discovered three comets and is credited under the name Y. C. Chang by the Minor Planet Center for the discovery of one minor planet, the outer main-belt asteroid 3789 Zhongguo.

==Biography==
Zhang was born in Fuzhou in the Minhou county, Fujian province in 1902. In 1919, he gained entrance to Tsinghua University. Graduating in 1923, he traveled to the United States where he began graduate studies at the University of Chicago in 1925, receiving his Ph.D. in 1929. Later that year, he returned to China and accepted a teaching post at the National Central University in Nanjing, China (now known as Nanjing University). He was the first astronomy professor at National Central University.

Zhang wrote his thesis on the orientation of the orbital plane of double stars under the mentorship of George Van Biesbroeck. While pursuing his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, in 1928, Zhang discovered an asteroid which was given the provisional designation 1928 UF and later the number 1125. He named it &quot;China&quot; or &quot;中華&quot; (&quot;Zhōnghuá&quot;). However, this asteroid was &quot;lost&quot; as it was not observed beyond its initial appearance and a precise orbit could not be calculated (see lost asteroids). In 1957, while Zhang was director of the Purple Mountain Observatory in China, the observatory discovered a new asteroid. With his agreement the new object was reassigned the official designation 1125 China in place of the lost 1928 UF. However, in 1986, the newly discovered object was confirmed to be a rediscovery of the original 1928 UF, and this object was named 3789 Zhongguo (&quot;中国&quot; (&quot;Zhōngguó&quot;) is the Mandarin Chinese word for &quot;China&quot;, in pinyin transliteration, whereas &quot;Zhōnghuá&quot; is a slightly older word for &quot;China&quot;).

From 1941 to 1950, Zhang was head of the astronomy research institute at National Central University. Between 1946 and 1948, he returned to the United States to study variable stars. In 1950 Zhang became the director of the Purple Mountain Observatory, a position he held until 1984. 

In 1955 he was elected a founding academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Zhang devoted himself to observing and calculating the orbits of minor planets and comets. Many asteroids were discovered at Purple Mountain Observatory, as well as three new comets: two periodic, 60P/Tsuchinshan (Tsuchinshan 2) and 62P/Tsuchinshan (Tsuchinshan 1), and one non-periodic, C/1977 V1. &quot;Tsuchinshan&quot; is the Wade-Giles transliteration corresponding to the pinyin &quot;Zĭjīn Shān&quot;, which is Mandarin Chinese for &quot;Purple Mountain&quot;, named after the observatory he oversaw.

The lunar crater &quot;Zhang Yuzhe&quot; and the main-belt asteroid 2051 Chang are named after him.

<doc id="621693" wikidata="Q421092" url="?curid=621693" title="Wulfenite">
<text>Wulfenite is a lead molybdate mineral with the formula PbMoO4. It often occurs as thin tabular crystals with a bright orange-red to yellow-orange color, sometimes brown, although the color can be highly variable. In its yellow form it is sometimes called &quot;yellow lead ore&quot;.

It crystallizes in the tetragonal system, often occurring as stubby, pyramidal or tabular crystals. It also occurs as earthy, granular masses. It is found in many localities, associated with lead ores as a secondary mineral associated with the oxidized zone of lead deposits. It is also a secondary ore of molybdenum, and is sought by collectors.

==Discovery and occurrence==

Wulfenite was first described in 1845 for an occurrence in Bad Bleiberg, Carinthia, Austria. It was named for Franz Xavier von Wulfen (1728–1805), an Austrian mineralogist.

It occurs as a secondary mineral in oxidized hydrothermal lead deposits. It occurs with cerussite, anglesite, smithsonite, hemimorphite, vanadinite, pyromorphite, mimetite, descloizite, plattnerite and various iron and manganese oxides.

A noted locality for wulfenite is the Red Cloud Mine in Arizona. Crystals are deep red in color and usually very well-formed. Wulfenite was approved as the official state mineral of Arizona in 2017. The Los Lamentos locality in Mexico produced very thick tabular orange crystals.

Another locality is Mount Peca in Slovenia. The crystals are yellow, often with well-developed pyramids and bipyramids. In 1997, the crystal was depicted on a stamp by the Post of Slovenia.

Lesser known localities of wulfenite include: Sherman Tunnel, St. Peter&#x27;s Dome, Tincup-Tomichi-Moncarch mining districts, Pride of America mine and Bandora mine in Colorado.

Small crystals also occur in Bulwell and Kirkby-in-Ashfield, England. These crystals occur in a galena-wulfenite-uraniferous asphaltite horizon in a magnesian limestone. The wulfenite found in this area is similar in properties (paragenetic sequence, low silver and antimony contents of the galenas and absence of pyromorphite) to the wulfenites of the Alps and may be similar in origin.

==Crystallography==
Wulfenite crystallizes in the tetragonal system and possesses nearly equal axial ratios; as a result, it is considered to be crystallographically similar to scheelite (CaWO4). Wulfenite is classed by a pyramidal-hemihedral (tetragonal dipyramidal) (C4h) crystal symmetry. Therefore, the unit cell is formed by placing points at the vertices and centers of the faces of rhomboids with square bases and the crystallographic axes coincide in directions with the edges of the rhomboids. Two of these lattices interpenetrate such that a point on the first is diagonal to the second and one quarter the distance between the two seconds.

An extensive solid solution exists between the two end members wulfenite and stolzite (PbWO), such that tungstenian-wulfenite compositions range from 90% wulfenite and 10% stolzite to chillagite (64% wulfenite, 36% stolzite) and so on. Nevertheless, the Commission for New Minerals and Mineral Names of the International Mineralogical Association has deemed that the solid solutions do not require new names. The correct nomenclature of the 90:10 solid state is wulfenite-&quot;I&quot;41/a and the 64:36 solid state is wulfenite-&quot;I&quot;4. The structure of the wulfenite-&quot;I&quot;41/a system can be described as a close packing of tetrahedral MoO42− anions and Pb2+ cations. In the lattice, the MoO42− anions are slightly distorted, though the bond lengths remain equal and the oxygens are linked through Pb-O bonds. Each lead atom has an 8-coordination with oxygen and two slightly different Pb-O bond distances. This structure closely resembles that of pure wulfenite.

The structure of wulfenite-&quot;I&quot;4 is also very similar to that of wulfenite-&quot;I&quot;41/a but has an unequal distribution of tungsten and molybdenum which may explain the observed hemihedrism.

It is argued that no miscibility gap exists in the wulfenite-stolzite solid solution at room temperature due to the almost identical size and shape of the MoO42− and WO42− ions, however, arguments have been made for the existence of a miscibility gap at higher temperatures.

==Hemihedrism==
The crystals of wulfenite are usually more tabular and thinner than those of scheelite; however, the more pyramidal and prismatic crystals show distinct hemimorphism.

==Thermodynamics and reactivity==
The heat capacity, entropy and enthalpy of wulfenite were determined taking into consideration the existence of solid solutions and the inclusion of impurities. The reported values are as follows: Cp°(298.15) = 119.41±0.13 J/molK, S°(298.15) = (168.33±2.06)J/molK, ΔH°= (23095±50) J/mol.

When forced through a tube into a flame, wulfenite disintegrates audibly and fuses readily. With the salt of phosphorus, it yields molybdenum beads. With soda on charcoal it yields a lead globule. When the powdered mineral is evaporated with HCl, molybdic oxide is formed.

Molybdenum can be extracted from wulfenite by crushing the ore to 60–80 mesh, mixing the ore with NaNO3 or NaOH, heating the mixture to about 700 °C (decomposing), leaching with water, filtering, collecting the insoluble residues which may include Fe, Al, Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb, Au and Ag, then the NaMoO4 solution is agitated with a solution of MgCl2, filtered, CaCl2 or FeCl2 or any other chlorides is added to the Mo solution and heated and agitated, filtered and the desired product is collected. The full process is patented by the Union Carbide and Carbon Corp.

==Synthesis ==
Wulfenite has been shown to form synthetically through the sintering of molybdite with cerussite as well as that of molybdite with lead oxide. The following will describe both methods of synthesis.

Synthesis from molybdite and cerussite:

Thermal analysis of the 1:1 mix of molybdite and cerussite first displayed the characteristic peaks of cerussite. There is a sharp endothermic peak at 300 °C, which occurs during the dehydration of hydrocerussite associated with cerussite. A second peak at 350 °C is the first step of cerussite’s dissociation into PbO*PbCO3. Later at 400 °C, a medium endothermic peak represents the second step of the dissociation into lead oxide. These transitions involve a decrease in mass, which occurs in steps. First, the dehydration of hydrocerussite is marked by its loss of constitutional OH and later is the freeing of carbon dioxide during the cerussite dissociation. The formation of wulfenite occurs at 520 °C, as observed in the exothermic peak. The reaction between lead oxides and molybdenum takes place at 500–600 °C, along with the formation of lead molybdate.

The endothermic peaks at 880 and 995 °C perhaps denote the vaporization and melting of unreacted lead and molybdenum oxides. A small peak at 1050 °C represents the melting of the wulfenite product itself, while an even smaller peak at 680 °C may indicate some vaporization of molybdite as the molybdenum oxide volatilizes at 600–650 °C.

This reaction occurs as follows:

350 °C: 2PbCO3 → PbO*PbCO3+CO2

400 °C: PbO*PbCO3 → 2PbO+CO2

500–520 °C: MoO 3+PbO → PbMoO4 (wulfenite)

Synthesis from molybdite and lead oxide:

Thermal analysis for molybdite and lead oxide mixes at a 1:1 ratio suggest that the formation of wulfenite occurs at 500 °C, as can be seen by an exothermic peak at this temperature. Microscopic investigation of the products show that at 500 °C, wulfenite is the main product, while at 950 °C, wulfenite is the only constituent of the product, as grains of molybdite and lead oxide melt and undergo volatilization. A small endothermic peak at 640 °C may represent the start of vaporization, and a sharp and large endothermic peak at 980 °C indicates the melting and volatilization of the unreacted lead and molybdenum oxides.

Characteristics of synthetic wulfenite:

Synthetically-made wulfenite will have the following composition: 61.38% PbO and 38.6% MoO3. This synthesis will give you samples of wulfenite that is pale-yellow in thin sections and is optically negative. It crystallizes in the tetragonal system, in the form of square tabular crystals, and with distinct cleavage on {011}. It crystals also display transparency and adamantine luster. The X-ray diffraction data, calculated cell dimensions, constants and optic axial angles of the synthetic wulfenite are consistent with those of the natural mineral.

==Coloration==
Pure wulfenite is colorless, but most all samples display colors ranging from a creamy yellow to a sharp, intense red. Some samples even display blues, browns, and blacks. The yellow and red coloration of wulfenites is caused by small traces of chromium. Others have suggested that while the lead adds little colors, perhaps the molybdate contributes to wulfenite’s yellow color.

More recent studies suggest that though the source of strong coloration is the presence of extrinsic impurities, the nonstoichiometry in both cationic and anionic sublattices also plays a major role in the coloration of the crystals. Tyagi et al. (2010) found that a reason for coloration in wulfenite is extrinsic impurity, as they were able to grow crystals displaying red, green, and various shades of yellow simply through changing the purity of the starting charges. They also posited that the presence of Pb3+ is not the cause of coloration. Because the crystals they grew in an Ar ambient are light yellow in color, they suggest that the interstitial oxygen concentration may be another cause in the coloration of wulfenite. Tyagi et al. note, however, the Mo is in a lower valence state when in Ar ambient, meaning it is Mo5+ rather than Mo6+. This suggests that the concentration of Mo5+ sites is also a cause of the coloration.

Talla et al. (2013) posits that trace amounts of chromium do in fact play a role in determining the coloration of wulfenite. Here, the CrO42- anion group substitutes for the MoO42- group in the tetrahedral position. They found that as little as 0.002 atoms per formula unit () of Cr6+ substituting for Mo6+ is adequate to result in an orange-hued specimen. Cr6+ values of 0.01 were able to result in a red color. Talla et al. went on to emphasize that the colors result from a change of absorption intensity rather than a change of spectral position.

<text>The China Post () was an English-language newspaper published in Taiwan (officially the Republic of China), alongside the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; and the &quot;Taiwan News&quot;. &quot;The China Post&quot; was established by Mr. and Mrs. Y. P. Huang in 1952. 

In April 2017, &quot;The China Post&quot; announced that the print edition of the publication would end on 15 May 2017, though the website and mobile application would remain active. 

In October 2017, the original &quot;China Post&quot; website was discontinued and merged with news agency NOWnews. &quot;The China Post&quot;, however, remained a member of Asia News Network. It translated articles from Chinese into English and continued to produce bilingual content. Digging back to its roots, it had also begun to write more original articles. These included opinion articles and analysis articles on a variety of local and international topics. 

In 2021, the China Post website was discontinued.

==&quot;The Sunday Post&quot;==
&quot;The Sunday Post&quot; was the Sunday edition of &quot;The China Post&quot;, featuring comics and a two-page bilingual supplement for advanced ESL students. &quot;The Sunday Post&quot; was the only bilingual weekly publication in Taiwan with a recap of the week&#x27;s news topics and analysis.

<text>Lumen, formerly Chilling Effects, is an American collaborative archive created by Wendy Seltzer and operated by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University. It allows recipients of cease-and-desist notices to submit them to the site and receive information about their legal rights and responsibilities. 

The archive was founded in 2001 with several law school clinics and the Electronic Frontier Foundation to protect lawful online activity from legal threats. Originally located in San Francisco, California, Lumen later moved its operations to Massachusetts.

==Inception==

The archive was founded in 2001 by Internet activists who were concerned that the unregulated private practice of sending cease-and-desist letters seemed to be increasing and was having an unstudied, but potentially significant, &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free speech.

The archive got a boost when Google began submitting its notices to the site in 2002. Google began to do so in response when the Church of Scientology convinced Google to remove references and links to an anti-Scientology web site, Operation Clambake, in April 2002. The incident inspired vocal Internet users and groups to complain to Google, and links to the Clambake site were restored. Google subsequently began to contribute its notices to Chilling Effects, archiving the Scientology complaints and linking to the archive.

Starting in 2002, researchers used the clearinghouse to study the use of cease-and-desist letters, primarily looking at Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) 512 takedown notices, non-DMCA copyright issues, and trademark claims.

On November 2, 2015, Chilling Effects announced its renaming to Lumen, as well as a number of international partnerships.

==Reception==
Lumen has been praised for providing and promoting transparency on the use of copyright takedowns.

The Copyright Alliance has criticized Lumen for republishing lists of URLs named in takedowns as part of its database. It argued that this defeats the purpose and intent of sending takedown notices to search engines in the first place, as they would subsequently be added to &quot;the largest repository of URLs hosting infringing content on the internet.&quot;. While the Lumen database formerly used to show full URLs, in 2019 the URLs were redacted to only display the website names and the number of URLs from each site, with the full URLs only to be made available to authorised users.

<doc id="621709" wikidata="Q3111674" url="?curid=621709" title="Gounki">
<text>Gounki is an abstract strategy game in which pieces can combine and disperse to affect their movement possibilities. Played on an eight-by-eight square grid, the goal is for a player to move their pieces off the opposite end of the board while preventing the opponent from doing the same.

It was invented by Christophe Malavasi in 1997.

== Rules ==
=== Starting position ===

Gounki is played on an eight-by-eight square.

Each player has eight round pieces and eight square pieces,
placed alternating on their first two rows (square pieces are on
black squares of a classic chessboard.)

=== Course of the game ===

On each turn, the player chooses whether to make a movement or a deployment.

Rounds pieces move one step in diagonal, always forward.
Squares pieces move one step on the left, on the right, or forward.

=== Movement ===

When a player moves his pieces, he may stack them above some of his other pieces, as long as he does not try to combine more than three elementary pieces altogether. If a combined piece comprises X rounds and Y squares, it may move up to X steps like a round, or up to Y steps like a square.

Combined pieces cannot :
* Change direction during a movement: a double square cannot move diagonally by combining a movement on the side and a movement forward.
* Play a square movement and a round movement during the same turn.
* Jump above other pieces.
* Move a piece partially and let part of it on its starting point.

==== Captures ====

Just like in chess: if an opponent&#x27;s piece is where you mean to go during a movement, it is captured.

=== Deployments ===

The second (and last) kind of move is the deployment.

When deploying a piece, you separate all the simple pieces making a composed pieces. You separate a simple piece by moving its parent composed piece like this simple piece.

After this movement, the simple piece is separated from its parent piece.

All the rounds are deployed, then all the squares, or all the squares followed by all the rounds.
It means you should not, for instance, deploy a round, a square, then a round again.
You can deploy above your own pieces, as long as you don&#x27;t build bigger than triple pieces.

You should not :
* Capture during a deployment. Thus, deployments involving opponent pieces are not possible.
* Change direction between deployment of two simple pieces of the same kind.
* Deploy a piece partially.
* Step back.

=== Bounds ===

Pieces mays rebound against the side during their movements or
deployments.

Examples:
* A round-round-square on b2 can have a b2-b4 movement or a b2*a3,b4,c4 deployment rebounding on left side.
* Using a rebound, square-square-round on a3 can deploy and recombine over itself: a3*b4,a4,b4+

== Game example ==
This game has been played on 8 March 2004 between Matthieu Walraet and MGounki.

* Matthieu Walraet is the best ranked human player for now (25 June 2004)
* MGounki is a Gounki-playing program.

<doc id="621711" wikidata="Q4115371" url="?curid=621711" title="Ramara">
<text>Ramara is a lower-tier township municipality in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada.

Ramara was formed in 1994 through the amalgamation of the townships of Rama and Mara. The municipality stretches along the northeastern shore of Lake Simcoe from Gamebridge to Orillia, and along the entire eastern shore of Lake Couchiching from Orillia to Washago. Farming, tourism and aggregate are the primary industries, and are supported by a wide variety of local enterprises. The area is perhaps best known for its proximity to Casino Rama, which is actually located on the neighbouring First Nations reserve of Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation in Rama.

==Communities==
The township comprises the communities of Atherley, Bayshore Village, Bayview Beach, Bonnie Beach, Brechin, Brechin Beach, Brechin Point, Concord Point, Cooper&#x27;s Falls, Fawkham, Floral Park, Fountain Beach, Gamebridge, Gamebridge Beach, Geneva Park, Glenrest Beach, Grays Bay, Hopkins Bay, Joyland Beach, Lagoon City, Lakeview Beach, Little Falls, Longford Mills, Mara Beach, Mariposa Beach, McDonald Beach, Millington (ghost town), Murphy Beach, New Gamebridge Beach, Oaklawn Beach, O&#x27;Connell, Orkney Point, Orkney Beach, Paradise Point, Point of Mara Beach, Prophet Beach, Ramona, Rathburn, Riverside Beach, Sandy Beach, Sandy Pine Beach, Southview Cove, Talbot, Tanglewood Beach, Udney, Uptergrove, and Val Harbour.

Brechin is one of the township&#x27;s largest communities. It is known for its several local businesses such as a new Tim Hortons and a Statue Store. The town has all the necessities of a small town, such as a Foodland, LCBO, Legion, both a Shell and a nearby Esso, as well as schools and churches. The town is also a central meeting location for the area&#x27;s youth where they partake in numerous recreational activity involving the town&#x27;s proximity to the lake.

The Township of Ramara owns and operates the Ramara Centre, located at 5482 Highway 12, between Atherley and Uptergrove.
The Township of Ramara also owns community centres in Longford, Udney and Brechin that are operated by Community Centre Boards of Management which are composed of volunteers.

There are three fire halls in the Township. Fire Hall #1 is located at 3290 County Road 47, Brechin at the corner of County Rd. 47 &amp; Hwy. 12. Fire Hall #2 is located at 85 Patricia Drive, Atherley at the corner of Patricia Drive &amp; Balsam Rd. Fire Hall #3 is located at 7305 Simcoe County Rd. 169, Washago at County Rd #169 &amp; Switch Road.

The Ontario Lumberjack Championships were held at the Brechin Ball Park on the second Saturday in June in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

The Canadian rock band, Floral Park, takes its name from the Floral Park community in which one of the band&#x27;s members grew up.

===Goffatt Island===

Located off from Sandy Beach, Goffatt Island is a privately owned 11.10 acres island in Lake Simcoe.

==History==

The former townships of Rama and Mara were first named in 1820. The origins of the names are unclear, as both may be either Spanish words (&quot;rama&quot; for &quot;branch&quot; and &quot;mara&quot; for &quot;sea&quot;) or Biblical references (&quot;rama&quot; for Ramah, the biblical town of Benjamin in ancient Israel, and &quot;mara&quot; for Marah, named in the biblical Book of Exodus as the place where Moses sweetened the bitter waters for the Israelites.) As both styles of place naming were popular in Ontario at the time, it is not clear which one Lieutenant-Governor Sir Peregrine Maitland had in mind. Being British, the names likely originated from the Ramayana, an ancient Sanskrit text. Rama (Ramachandra), is a major deity of Hinduism. He is the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu. Mara is a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;death&quot; or any personification thereof. 

The townships were originally part of York County, but were transferred to Ontario County when they were first incorporated as an amalgamated municipality in 1852. They were later reincorporated as separate municipalities in 1869.

A portion of Rama Township was allocated to form what became the Mnjikaning First Nation 32 Indian reserve of the Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation. Many Indigenous people were living on the narrow strip of land that separates lakes Simcoe and Couchiching between Atherley and Orillia. These lands were surrendered by treaty in 1836. After that time, the local Indian Agent began purchasing lands in Rama Township and the Indigenous people were resettled there. The main settlement on the reserve is also known as Rama and is the site of Casino Rama.

North of Rama, the community of Longford Mills was established in 1868. In 1867 American lumberman Henry W. Sage had purchased blocks of land in Rama Township after buying timber berths in Oakley Township in Muskoka District. Sage had considered relocating his mill from Bell Ewart to a point between the Black River and Lake Couchiching, or possibly at Wasdell Falls. This area lacked rail transport, so the sawn lumber would have to be barged to the Northern Railway at Bell Ewart. Instead, Sage came up with the idea of a canal to float logs from the Black River to supply the mills of Lake Simcoe. The Rama Timber Transport Company was formed in 1868. Not only did it allow the logs of Muskoka and Victoria reach the mills of Lake Simcoe, but helped establish the community of Longford Mills.

Ontario County was dissolved upon the formation of the Regional Municipality of Durham in 1974, and both townships were transferred to Simcoe County. As part of the municipal restructuring of Simcoe County, Mara and Rama Townships were reamalgamated to form Ramara in 1994.

==Transportation==

===Rail===
Washago station, located in the neighbouring township of Severn, is served by Via Rail&#x27;s weekly &quot;Canadian&quot; transcontinental service between Toronto and Vancouver. The station was also formerly a stop on the Ontario Northland Railway&#x27;s &quot;Northlander&quot; service.

The gingerbread style Atherley Junction station was built by the Grand Trunk Railway in what is now Ramara in 1897, but it was destroyed by a fire in 1931. It was likely rebuilt after 1931 by Canadian National Railway, and now the structure is now located at Couchiching Beach Park in Orillia, Ontario.

===Bus===

There is bus service from Toronto to Washago operated by Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services. As well, there is extensive charter bus service to Casino Rama.

===Car===
Ontario Highway 12 (Trans Canada Highway) is a main connecting road between Ontario Highway 169 and Rama Road (Simcoe County Road 44).

===Air===

The closest airport is Lake Simcoe Regional Airport located between Barrie, Ontario and Orillia, and the closest major airport is Toronto Pearson Airport, via Highway 12 and Highway 400.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Ramara had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>Richard Howard Stafford Crossman (15 December 1907 – 5 April 1974) was a British Labour Party politician. A university classics lecturer by profession, he was elected a Member of Parliament in 1945 and became a significant figure among the party&#x27;s advocates of Zionism. He was a Bevanite on the left of the party, and a long-serving member of Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee (NEC) from 1952.

Crossman was a Cabinet minister in Harold Wilson&#x27;s governments of 1964–1970, first for Housing, then as Leader of the House of Commons, and then for Social Services. In the early 1970s, Crossman was editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. He is remembered for his highly revealing three-volume &quot;Diaries of a Cabinet Minister&quot;, published posthumously.

==Early life==
Crossman was born on Sunday, 15 December 1907 at Buckhurst Hill House, Essex, the son of Charles Stafford Crossman, a barrister and later a High Court judge, and Helen Elizabeth (&quot;née&quot; Howard). Helen was of the Howard family of Ilford descended from Luke Howard, a Quaker chemist and meteorologist who founded the pharmaceutical company Howards and Sons.

Crossman grew up in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, and was educated at Twyford School, and at Winchester College (although founders&#x27; kin privileges at Winchester were abolished in 1857, Crossman was &quot;founder&#x27;s kin&quot;, being descended from William of Wykeham through John Danvers, one of his father&#x27;s ancestors), where he became head boy. He excelled academically and on the football field. He studied Classics at New College, Oxford, where he was friendly with W.H. Auden. He received a double first and became a fellow in 1931. He taught philosophy at the university before becoming a Workers&#x27; Educational Association lecturer. He was a councillor on Oxford City Council, and became head of its Labour group in 1935.

==Personal life==
Crossman, who had been noted for his good looks as a youth, had predominantly same-sex affairs at Oxford. In an early diary, he describes an Easter holiday with an unnamed young poet: &quot;He kept me in a little white-washed room for a fortnight because his mouth was against mine and we were completely together.&quot;

After being married to Erika Glück, a divorcée, whom he met while travelling in Germany after graduation, he married Zita Baker (ex-wife of John Baker) in 1937.

==Service in World War II and afterwards==
At the outbreak of the Second World War, Crossman joined the Political Warfare Executive under Robert Bruce Lockhart, where he headed the German Section. He produced anti-Nazi propaganda broadcasts for the BBC German Service and the Radio of the European Revolution, set up by the Special Operations Executive (SOE). He eventually became Assistant Chief of the Psychological Warfare Division of SHAEF and was awarded an OBE for his wartime service.

In April 1945, Crossman was one of the first British officers to enter the former Dachau concentration camp. With war correspondent Colin Wills, Crossman co-wrote the script for &quot;German Concentration Camps Factual Survey&quot;, a British government documentary, produced by Sidney Bernstein with treatment advice by Alfred Hitchcock, that showed gruelling scenes from Nazi concentration camps. The uncompleted film was shelved for decades before being assembled by scholars at the Imperial War Museum and released in 2014. That same year, &quot;German Concentration Camps Factual Survey&quot; was itself the subject of a documentary, &quot;Night Will Fall&quot;.

Crossman became a key participant in the annual Königswinter Conference, organised by Lilo Milchsack to bring together British and German legislators, academics and opinion-formers from 1950 onwards. The conferences were credited with helping to heal bad memories created by the war. At them, Crossman met the German politician Hans von Herwarth, the ex-soldier Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin, future German President Richard von Weizsäcker and other leading German decision makers. Other attendees at the conferences included Denis Healey, soon to become a Labour Party politician, and Robin Day, later a political broadcaster.

==Political career: 1945–51==
Crossman entered the House of Commons at the 1945 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Coventry East, a seat he held until shortly before he died in 1974. During 1945–46 he served, on the nomination of the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, as a member of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry into the Problems of European Jewry and Palestine. The committee&#x27;s report, submitted in April 1946, included a recommendation for 100,000 Jewish displaced persons to be permitted to enter Mandatory Palestine. Short of American financial and military assistance, the British government refused to implement the report&#x27;s recommendations. Thereafter Crossman led the socialist opposition to the official British policy for Palestine. That incurred Bevin&#x27;s enmity, and may have been the primary factor which prevented Crossman from achieving ministerial rank during the 1945–51 government. Crossman initially supported the Arab cause, but became a lifelong Zionist after meeting Chaim Weizmann. In his diary, he described Weizmann as &quot;one of the very few great men I have ever met.&quot; Crossman remained a supporter of Israel during his political career from the late-1940s until his death in 1974. At a 1959 lecture in Israel, Crossman attacked what he perceived as hypocrisy over Israel regarding anti-indigenous racism.&quot;For generations it had been assumed that civilisation would be spread by the white man settling overseas... No one, until the 20th century, seriously challenged their right, or indeed their duty, to civilise these continents by physically occupying them, even at the cost of wiping out the aboriginal population.&quot;

During the Palestine Emergency, Crossman&#x27;s support for Zionism went as far as collaborating against the British Mandate government. One such attack in which he was implicated was the Night of the Bridges. Although no British soldiers were killed in the initial attacks, 20-year-old Royal Engineer Roy Charles Allen was killed while trying to defuse an undetonated bomb. Christopher Mayhew later recounted the collaboration in his book &quot;Publish It Not: The Middle East Cover-up&quot;:&quot;One day, Crossman, now in the House of Commons, came to see Strachey… [Crossman] had heard from his friends in the Jewish Agency that they were contemplating an act of sabotage … Should this be done, or should it not? Few would be killed … Crossman asked Strachey for his advice … The next day in the smoking room at the House of Commons, Strachey gave his approval to Crossman. The Haganah went ahead and blew up all the bridges over the [River] Jordan.&quot;Crossman later claimed that Bevin and Clement Attlee had acted on &quot;prejudice in favour of the native and against the white settler.&quot; He never forgave either of them for anti-Zionist policies, later telling Frank Soskice:&quot;You seem to have forgotten that Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin plotted to destroy the Jews in Palestine and the encouraged the Arabs to murder the lot. I fought them at the time as murderers. I can never trust them again and you can&#x27;t expect me to forgive them for genocide.&quot;Crossman cemented his role as a leader of the left-wing of the Parliamentary Labour Party in 1947 by co-authoring the &quot;Keep Left&quot; pamphlet, and later became one of the more prominent Bevanites.

==Anti-communist propaganda==
Crossman is considered by historians to be a central figure to British Cold War propaganda due to his collaboration with the Information Research Department (IRD), a secret branch of the UK Foreign Office dedicated to disinformation, anti-communist, and pro-colonial propaganda during the Cold War. The IRD secretly funded, published and distributed many of Crossman&#x27;s articles and books, including &quot;The God that Failed&quot;. His anti-communist works were not only of special interest to British propagandists but were also secretly sponsored by the US government, which translated his works into Malay and Chinese. Crossman was also a regular contributor to &quot;Encounter&quot;, an &quot;anti-Stalinist&quot; publication which received funding from MI6 and the CIA.

Crossman&#x27;s intense relationship with disinformation for propaganda purposes led to many people nicknaming him &quot;Dick Double-Crossman&quot;. His name was also included within one of George Orwell&#x27;s notebooks following the discovery of Orwell&#x27;s list, being noted by Orwell as being &quot;Too dishonest to be outright F. T&quot; (fellow-traveller).

==Political career: 1951–70==
Crossman was a member of the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party from 1952 to 1967 and served as its chair from 1960 to 1961.

In 1957, Crossman was one of the plaintiffs, along with Aneurin Bevan and Morgan Phillips, in a claim for libel made against &quot;The Spectator&quot;, which had described the three men as drinking heavily during a socialist conference in Italy. Having sworn that the charges were untrue, the three collected damages from the magazine. Many years later, Crossman&#x27;s posthumously published diaries confirmed that &quot;The Spectator&quot;″s charges had been true and that all three of them had perjured themselves.

Crossman was Labour&#x27;s spokesman on education before the 1964 general election, but upon forming the new Government Harold Wilson appointed him to the Cabinet as Minister of Housing and Local Government. In 1966, Crossman became Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons.

Between 1968 and 1970, he was the first Secretary of State for Social Services, in which position he worked on an ambitious proposal to supplement Britain&#x27;s flat-rate state pension with an earnings-related element. The proposal had not, however, been passed into law at the time the Labour Party lost the 1970 general election. During the months of political turmoil that led up to the election loss, Crossman had been considered, however briefly, as a last-minute option to replace Wilson as Prime Minister.

==Books and journalism==
After Labour&#x27;s general election defeat in 1970, Crossman resigned from the Labour front bench to become editor of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, where he had been a frequent contributor and assistant editor from 1938 until 1955. He left the &quot;New Statesman&quot; in 1972.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Crossman also had a regular column titled &quot;Crossman Says...&quot; in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, the Labour-supporting tabloid newspaper. Along with the column of &quot;Cassandra&quot;, Crossman&#x27;s reporting provided the bulk of political and international commentary in the newspaper.

Crossman was a prolific writer and editor. In &quot;Plato To-Day&quot; (1937) he imagines Plato visiting Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. Plato criticises Nazi and Communist politicians for misusing the ideas he had set forth in the &quot;Republic&quot;. After the war, Crossman edited &quot;The God That Failed&quot; (1949), a collection of anti-Communist essays by former Communists.

Crossman is best remembered for his colourful and highly subjective three-volume &quot;Diaries of a Cabinet Minister&quot;, written while he was living in Vincent Square, published posthumously from 1975 to 1977 and covering his time in government from 1964 to 1970. The diaries appeared after he had died, and following a legal battle by the government to block publication. One of Crossman&#x27;s legal executors was Michael Foot, then a cabinet minister, who opposed his own government&#x27;s attempts to suppress the diaries. Among other things, the diaries describe Crossman&#x27;s battles with &quot;the Dame&quot;, his Permanent Secretary Evelyn Sharp, GBE (1903–1985), the first woman in Britain to hold the position. Crossman&#x27;s backbench diaries were published in 1981. Crossman&#x27;s diaries were an acknowledged source for the television comedy series &quot;Yes Minister&quot;.

==Death==
Richard Crossman died of liver cancer at 3.30pm on 5 April 1974 at his home in Banbury Oxfordshire. He had known since September 1973 that he was terminally ill. He was cremated five days later and was survived by his third wife, Anne Patricia (15 April 1920 – 3 October 2008; &quot;née&quot; McDougall, daughter of Patrick McDougall, of Prescote Manor, Cropredy, founder of the Banbury cattle market), with whom he shared common descent from the Danvers family of Cropredy. Anne Crossman worked at Bletchley Park during the Second World War, and served as secretary to Maurice Edelman MP. The Crossmans had two children, Patrick and Virginia.

== Legacy ==

The Richard Crossman Building, built in 1971, at Coventry University is named in his honour. Crosssman&#x27;s papers are at the Modern Records Centre, at the University of Warwick.

Richard Crossman features in the theatre production Little Edens, set during the Florence Park rent strike of 1934.

The former Labour MP Bryan Magee wrote in his autobiography &quot;Making the Most of It&quot; that Crossman was &quot;the most brilliant debater I have heard&quot;.

<text>The Henrician Articles or King Henry&#x27;s Articles (; ; ) were a constitution in the form of a permanent agreement made in 1573 between the &quot;Polish nation&quot; (the szlachta, or nobility, of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and a newly-elected Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke upon his election to the throne. The Articles were the primary constitutional law of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

While &quot;pacta conventa&quot; (a sort of manifesto or government programme) comprised only the personal undertakings of the king-elect, the Henrician Articles were a permanent constitutional law which all King-Grand Dukes were obligated to swear to uphold.

The articles functioned essentially as the first constitution for Poland-Lithuania until the Constitution of 3 May 1791.

== Origins ==
The charter took the form of 18 articles written and adopted by the Polish-Lithuanian nobility in 1573 at the town of Kamień, near Warsaw, during the interregnum after the extinction of the Jagiellon dynasty. The document took its name from that of Henry of Valois, the first Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke elected in a free election. He was obliged to sign the Articles to be allowed to ascend the throne. Subsequently, every king-elect was required to swear fidelity to them, like the similar documents, the &quot;pacta conventa&quot;, but the latter were tailored and different for each king-elect. Acceptance by the king-elect of the articles was a condition for his elevation to the throne, and they formed part of the royal oath at the coronation.

== Provisions ==
* The king was to be chosen by election by the szlachta, and his children had no right of inheritance with regard to the throne.
* The king&#x27;s marriages had to gain the approval of the Senate.
* The king had to convene a general sejm (the Commonwealth Parliament) at least once every two years for six weeks.
* The king had no right to create new taxes, tariffs or such without the approval of the Sejm;
* Between sejms, 16 resident senators were to be at the king&#x27;s side as his advisers and overseers. The Royal Council of 16 senators was elected every two years during the Sejm&#x27;s session. Four of their number (rotating every six months) were obliged to accompany the king and serve as advisers and supervisors to ensure that the king made no decision contrary to the laws of the Commonwealth. All royal decrees had to be counterstamped by the chancellors or the deputy chancellors.
* The king had no right to call a &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; (levée en masse) without the approval of the Sejm. Further, the Articles upheld the informal tradition that the king could not send those troops to serve outside the Commonwealth&#x27;s borders without compensation.
* The standing royal army (&quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot;) was provided for.
* The king had no right to declare war or peace without the approval of the Sejm.
* The king had to abide by the Warsaw Confederation&#x27;s guarantees of religious freedom.
* If the king transgressed the law or the nobility&#x27;s privileges, the szlachta could refuse the king&#x27;s orders and act against him (in Polish, that became known as the &quot;rokosz&quot;). Each king had to swear that &quot;if anything has been done by Us against laws, liberties, privileges or customs, we declare all the inhabitants of the Kingdom are freed from obedience to Us&quot;.

<text>Lisa Lyttelton, Dowager Viscountess Cobham (née Clayton, born 30 December 1958) is the first British woman to sail single-handed and non-stop around the world. She was educated in Birmingham at the Church of England School for Girls, Edgbaston, and the University of Birmingham.

On 17 September 1994 Clayton set out to attempt two world records, namely &quot;Fastest Sail Around the World by a Woman, Single-Handed Without Assistance&quot; and &quot;First British Woman to Sail Single-Handed and Non-Stop Around the World.&quot; She returned on 29 June 1995, after 285 days at sea.

On her thirty-eight foot yacht, called &quot;Spirit of Birmingham&quot;, Clayton survived the journey despite capsizing twice. Her vessel was named after her home city and the university which contributed over £40,000 and expertise to make it possible for Clayton to realise her dream. On 1 October 1996, Clayton was recognised as an Honorary Freeman of the City of Birmingham.

On 1 August 1997 she married the 11th Viscount Cobham, owner of Hagley Hall in Worcestershire. He died in 2006.

<doc id="621732" wikidata="Q1939186" url="?curid=621732" title="Geometric topology">
<text>In mathematics, geometric topology is the study of manifolds and maps between them, particularly embeddings of one manifold into another.

== History ==
Geometric topology as an area distinct from algebraic topology may be said to have originated in the 1935 classification of lens spaces by Reidemeister torsion, which required distinguishing spaces that are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic. This was the origin of &quot;simple&quot; homotopy theory. The use of the term geometric topology to describe these seems to have originated rather recently.

== Differences between low-dimensional and high-dimensional topology ==
Manifolds differ radically in behavior in high and low dimension.

High-dimensional topology refers to manifolds of dimension 5 and above, or in relative terms, embeddings in codimension 3 and above. Low-dimensional topology is concerned with questions in dimensions up to 4, or embeddings in codimension up to 2.

Dimension 4 is special, in that in some respects (topologically), dimension 4 is high-dimensional, while in other respects (differentiably), dimension 4 is low-dimensional; this overlap yields phenomena exceptional to dimension 4, such as exotic differentiable structures on R4. Thus the topological classification of 4-manifolds is in principle tractable, and the key questions are: does a topological manifold admit a differentiable structure, and if so, how many? Notably, the smooth case of dimension 4 is the last open case of the generalized Poincaré conjecture; see Gluck twists.

The distinction is because surgery theory works in dimension 5 and above (in fact, in many cases, it works topologically in dimension 4, though this is very involved to prove), and thus the behavior of manifolds in dimension 5 and above may be studied using the surgery theory program. In dimension 4 and below (topologically, in dimension 3 and below), surgery theory does not work.
Indeed, one approach to discussing low-dimensional manifolds is to ask &quot;what would surgery theory predict to be true, were it to work?&quot; – and then understand low-dimensional phenomena as deviations from this.
The precise reason for the difference at dimension 5 is because the Whitney embedding theorem, the key technical trick which underlies surgery theory, requires 2+1 dimensions. Roughly, the Whitney trick allows one to &quot;unknot&quot; knotted spheres – more precisely, remove self-intersections of immersions; it does this via a homotopy of a disk – the disk has 2 dimensions, and the homotopy adds 1 more – and thus in codimension greater than 2, this can be done without intersecting itself; hence embeddings in codimension greater than 2 can be understood by surgery. In surgery theory, the key step is in the middle dimension, and thus when the middle dimension has codimension more than 2 (loosely, 2½ is enough, hence total dimension 5 is enough), the Whitney trick works. The key consequence of this is Smale&#x27;s &quot;h&quot;-cobordism theorem, which works in dimension 5 and above, and forms the basis for surgery theory.

A modification of the Whitney trick can work in 4 dimensions, and is called Casson handles – because there are not enough dimensions, a Whitney disk introduces new kinks, which can be resolved by another Whitney disk, leading to a sequence (&quot;tower&quot;) of disks. The limit of this tower yields a topological but not differentiable map, hence surgery works topologically but not differentiably in dimension 4.

== Important tools in geometric topology ==
===Fundamental group===

In all dimensions, the fundamental group of a manifold is a very important invariant, and determines much of the structure; in dimensions 1, 2 and 3, the possible fundamental groups are restricted, while in dimension 4 and above every finitely presented group is the fundamental group of a manifold (note that it is sufficient to show this for 4- and 5-dimensional manifolds, and then to take products with spheres to get higher ones).

===Orientability===

A manifold is orientable if it has a consistent choice of orientation, and a connected orientable manifold has exactly two different possible orientations. In this setting, various equivalent formulations of orientability can be given, depending on the desired application and level of generality. Formulations applicable to general topological manifolds often employ methods of homology theory, whereas for differentiable manifolds more structure is present, allowing a formulation in terms of differential forms. An important generalization of the notion of orientability of a space is that of orientability of a family of spaces parameterized by some other space (a fiber bundle) for which an orientation must be selected in each of the spaces which varies continuously with respect to changes in the parameter values.

===Handle decompositions===
A handle decomposition of an &quot;m&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot; is a union

:formula_1

where each formula_2 is obtained from formula_3
by the attaching of formula_4-handles. A handle decomposition is to a manifold what a CW-decomposition is to a topological space—in many regards the purpose of a handle decomposition is to have a language analogous to CW-complexes, but adapted to the world of smooth manifolds. Thus an &quot;i&quot;-handle is the smooth analogue of an &quot;i&quot;-cell. Handle decompositions of manifolds arise naturally via Morse theory. The modification of handle structures is closely linked to Cerf theory.

===Local flatness===

Local flatness is a property of a submanifold in a topological manifold of larger dimension. In the category of topological manifolds, locally flat submanifolds play a role similar to that of embedded submanifolds in the category of smooth manifolds.

Suppose a &quot;d&quot; dimensional manifold &quot;N&quot; is embedded into an &quot;n&quot; dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; (where &quot;d&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;). If formula_5 we say &quot;N&quot; is locally flat at &quot;x&quot; if there is a neighborhood formula_6 of &quot;x&quot; such that the topological pair formula_7 is homeomorphic to the pair formula_8, with a standard inclusion of formula_9 as a subspace of formula_10. That is, there exists a homeomorphism formula_11 such that the image of formula_12 coincides with formula_9.

===Schönflies theorems===

The generalized Schoenflies theorem states that, if an (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-dimensional sphere &quot;S&quot; is embedded into the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere &quot;Sn&quot; in a locally flat way (that is, the embedding extends to that of a thickened sphere), then the pair (&quot;Sn&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) is homeomorphic to the pair (&quot;Sn&quot;, &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1), where &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 is the equator of the &quot;n&quot;-sphere. Brown and Mazur received the Veblen Prize for their independent proofs of this theorem.

==Branches of geometric topology==

===Low-dimensional topology===

Low-dimensional topology includes:
* Surfaces (2-manifolds)
* 3-manifolds
* 4-manifolds
each have their own theory, where there are some connections.

Low-dimensional topology is strongly geometric, as reflected in the uniformization theorem in 2 dimensions – every surface admits a constant curvature metric; geometrically, it has one of 3 possible geometries: positive curvature/spherical, zero curvature/flat, negative curvature/hyperbolic – and the geometrization conjecture (now theorem) in 3 dimensions – every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces, each of which has one of 8 possible geometries.

2-dimensional topology can be studied as complex geometry in one variable (Riemann surfaces are complex curves) – by the uniformization theorem every conformal class of metrics is equivalent to a unique complex one, and 4-dimensional topology can be studied from the point of view of complex geometry in two variables (complex surfaces), though not every 4-manifold admits a complex structure.

===Knot theory===

Knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician&#x27;s knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone. In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3 (since we&#x27;re using topology, a circle isn&#x27;t bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

To gain further insight, mathematicians have generalized the knot concept in several ways. Knots can be considered in other three-dimensional spaces and objects other than circles can be used; see &quot;knot (mathematics)&quot;. Higher-dimensional knots are &quot;n&quot;-dimensional spheres in &quot;m&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space.

===High-dimensional geometric topology===
In high-dimensional topology, characteristic classes are a basic invariant, and surgery theory is a key theory.

A characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle on a topological space &quot;X&quot; a cohomology class of &quot;X&quot;. The cohomology class measures the extent to which the bundle is &quot;twisted&quot; — particularly, whether it possesses sections or not. In other words, characteristic classes are global invariants which measure the deviation of a local product structure from a global product structure. They are one of the unifying geometric concepts in algebraic topology, differential geometry and algebraic geometry.

Surgery theory is a collection of techniques used to produce one manifold from another in a &#x27;controlled&#x27; way, introduced by . Surgery refers to cutting out parts of the manifold and replacing it with a part of another manifold, matching up along the cut or boundary. This is closely related to, but not identical with, handlebody decompositions. It is a major tool in the study and classification of manifolds of dimension greater than 3.

More technically, the idea is to start with a well-understood manifold &quot;M&quot; and perform surgery on it to produce a manifold &quot;M &quot;′ having some desired property, in such a way that the effects on the homology, homotopy groups, or other interesting invariants of the manifold are known.

The classification of exotic spheres by led to the emergence of surgery theory as a major tool in high-dimensional topology.

<text>Margaret Ann Jones (born 4 November 1953) is a Welsh Labour Co-operative politician. Born in Rhyl, Denbighshire, Jones was the Member of the Senedd (MS) for Vale of Clwyd from 1999 until she retired in 2021. From 11 May 2016 until her retirement, she was the Deputy Presiding Officer for the Senedd.

== Family ==
Margaret Ann Jones was born to Charles Jones and Helen Jones (née Sadler) in Rhyl. She was educated at Rhyl Grammar School and Rhyl High School. She married Adrian Jones in 1973 and has 1 son and 1 daughter.

== Early Career ==
Ann worked as an Emergency Call Officer and a number of management positions in the control room of Flintshire Fire Brigade and Clwyd Fire Brigade between 1970 and 1979 and as a Fire Control Officer with Merseyside Fire Brigade from 1991 to 1999.

Ann served as a national officer in the Fire Brigades Union for a number of years and has sat on the executive boards of the Welsh Labour Party and the Wales TUC. She is a member of UNISON and remains a &#x27;out of trade&#x27; member of the FBU.

== Political career ==

=== Local Politics ===
Ann Jones was a member of Rhyl Town Council from 1991 to 1999, and Mayor of Rhyl in 1996–7. She was a councillor on Denbighshire County Council from 1995 to 1999 and agent for Chris Ruane MP at the 1997 General Election. She is a member of the Christian Socialist Movement.

=== Senedd ===
She was elected to the Senedd for the Vale of Clwyd in 1999, holding the seat at every Assembly Election until her resignation in 2021. She sat as a Labour member until the 2011 election after which she sat as a Labour Co-operative member.

Ann chaired several Assembly Committees including the Children, Young People and Education Committee, the All Party Group on Deaf Issues and was chair of the National Assembly Labour Group from 2011 to 2016. From 2011–2013, Jones chaired the Communities, Equalities and Local Government Committee.

Her political interests include education, tourism, community safety, regeneration, social policy and the Emergency Services. She is a fan of Rhyl Football Club. 

In 2016 she was elected Deputy Presiding Officer of the National Assembly, defeating Labour Newport East AM, John Griffiths 30-29.

Jones was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2021 New Year Honours for parliamentary and public service in Wales.

=== Post Senedd career ===

Jones was elected to represent North Wales constituency Labour parties on the Welsh Executive Committee in 2022 and re-elected in 2024.
She was then elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in September 2024 as Welsh representative, succeeding Carwyn Jones. 

==== Fire Safety Measure ====
In 2007, Ann Jones won a ballot and had the opportunity to introduce the first Senedd Measure from a backbench member. Ann Jones announced her intention to introduce legislation to make it mandatory to install a fire suppression system in  new homes. The process of transferring the law-making powers to the Senedd began in 2007 and in 2010 a Legislative Competence Order was made allowing the Senedd to legislate. The Domestic Fire Safety (Wales) Measure 2011 was debated in the Senedd in 2010 and 2011 before receiving Royal assent on 7 April 2011.

In 2019 Ann Jones donated a collection of papers related to the legislation to the National Library of Wales.

<doc id="621742" wikidata="Q714352" url="?curid=621742" title="Purple Mountain Observatory">
<text>The Purple Mountain Observatory (), also known as Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory, is an astronomical observatory located on the Purple Mountain in the east of Nanjing. The observatory is responsible for calculating the official Chinese calendar of mainland China.

== Description ==
The Purple Mountain Observatory was established in 1934 funded by the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China and administered by Academia Sinica. The longtime director of the observatory from 1950 to 1984 was Chinese astronomer Zhang Yuzhe (, 1902–1986, also known as Y. C. Chang).

By the late 1980s, increasing light pollution in Nanjing meant Purple Mountain was no longer viable as a working observatory. It has since shifted its focus to public education, with much of the actual scientific work being carried out in its five branch observatories located at Qinghai (in Delingha), Ganyu, Xuyi, Honghe (in Jiamusi), and Qingdao.

The Minor Planet Center credits the observatory, simply referred to as Nanking, with the discovery of 149 minor planets between 1955 and 1983, while the observatory&#x27;s PMO NEO Survey Program is credited with more than 600 discoveries between 2006 and 2013.

=== Discoveries ===

The observatory discovered the periodic comets 60P/Tsuchinshan and 62P/Tsuchinshan, as well as the non-periodic (Tsuchinshan), also known as Comet 1977 X, , and C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). They are named after the postal romanization of the name (Wade–Giles: &quot;Tzu-chin-shan&quot;; pinyin: &quot;Zǐjīnshān&quot;). Many asteroids were also discovered, including the Trojan asteroids 2223 Sarpedon, 2260 Neoptolemus, 2363 Cebriones, 2456 Palamedes, and the eponymous 3494 Purple Mountain.

=== Near-Earth object survey ===

The &quot;Chinese Near-Earth Object Survey&quot; (CNEOS), based at the Xuyi Station in Xuyi, Jiangsu, started observations in 2006. It uses a 1:04=1:20=1:80 m Schmidt telescope equipped with a 4K × 4K CCD detector with the drift-scanning function. As of August 2012, the program has observed 149,971 asteroids, found 1,279 new provisional designation asteroids, and cataloged 251 numbered asteroids including five Jupiter trojans, two Hildian, and one Phocaea asteroid. The program has also observed the position of 824 near-Earth objects (NEOs) and discovered four new ones: the Apollo asteroid , and the three Amor asteroid , , and .

=== List of discovered minor planets (1955–1983) ===

A total of 149 minor planets were discovered by the Purple Mountain Observatory between 1955 and 1983.



=== List of discoveries by the PMO NEO Survey Program ===

<doc id="621744" wikidata="Q435501" url="?curid=621744" title="Federico da Montefeltro">
<text>Federico da Montefeltro, also known as Federico III da Montefeltro KG (7 June 1422 – 10 September 1482), was one of the most successful mercenary captains (&quot;condottieri&quot;) of the Italian Renaissance, and lord of Urbino from 1444 (as Duke from 1474) until his death. A renowned intellectual humanist and civil leader in Urbino on top of his impeccable reputation for martial skill and honour, he commissioned the construction of a great library, perhaps the largest of Italy after the Vatican, with his own team of scribes in his scriptorium, and assembled around him a large humanistic court in the Ducal Palace, Urbino, designed by Luciano Laurana and Francesco di Giorgio Martini.

==Biography==

Federico was born in Castello di Petroia in Gubbio. Guidantonio da Montefeltro, lord of Urbino, Gubbio and Casteldurante, and Duke of Spoleto acknowledged Federico as his illegitimate son. Two years later he was legitimized by Pope Martin V, with the consent of Guidantonio&#x27;s wife, Caterina Colonna, who was Martin&#x27;s niece. However, there were persistent rumours that Federico was not Guidantonio&#x27;s son, but his grandson. Guidantonio had an illegitimate daughter named Aura, who, in 1420, married Bernardino Ubaldini della Carda, a captain in Guidantonio&#x27;s employ. It was rumoured that, being without a son and heir at the time, Guidantonio took his daughter&#x27;s firstborn son soon after birth and passed the child off as his own. This rumour was recorded by various commentators during Federico&#x27;s lifetime, including Pope Pius II. 

In the aftermath of the Peace of Ferrara (see Wars in Lombardy) in 1433, he lived in Venice and Mantua as a hostage. In 1437 he was knighted by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, and in the same year, he married Gentile Brancaleoni in Gubbio.

At sixteen, he began a career as condottiero under Niccolò Piccinino. In 1441 he distinguished himself in the conquest of the castle of St. Leo, which Federico was to hold for the rest of his life. After Piccinino&#x27;s resignation, he went to Pesaro to defend it against his great enemy in the Marche, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, lord of Rimini.

On 22 July 1444, his half-brother Oddantonio da Montefeltro, recently created Duke of Urbino by Pope Eugene IV, was assassinated in a conspiracy: Federico, whose participation in the plot has never been firmly established, subsequently seized the city of Urbino. However, the financial situation of the small dukedom being in disarray, he continued to wage war as a condottiero. His first &quot;condotta&quot; was for Francesco I Sforza, with 300 knights: Federico was also one of the few condottieri of the time to have a reputation for inspiring loyalty among his followers. In the pay of the Sforza—for Federico never fought for free—he transferred Pesaro to their control, and, for 13,000 florins, received Fossombrone as his share, infuriating Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. Despite Federico&#x27;s efforts, the Sforza sovereignty in the Marche was dismantled in the following years. When Sforza left for Lombardy, Sigismondo instigated a riot in Fossombrone, but Federico reconquered it three days later.
After six years in the service of Florence, Federico was hired in 1450 by Sforza, now Duke of Milan. However, he could not perform his duties as he lost his right eye during a tournament. Malatesta profited from his injury to obtain the position under Sforza, whereupon Federico in October 1451 accepted instead a proposal by Alfonso V of Aragon, King of Naples, to fight for him against Florence. After the loss of the eye, Federico – no stranger to conspiracies and one of the leaders that inspired Niccolò Machiavelli to write &quot;Il Principe&quot; – had surgeons remove the bridge of his nose (which had been injured in the incident) and eyelid. This improved his field of vision to a considerable extent, rendered him less vulnerable to assassination attempts – and, as can be seen by his successful career thereafter, restored his merits as a field commander.

In 1453 the Neapolitan army was struck by malaria, and Federico himself risked losing his healthy eye. The Peace of Lodi of the following year seemed to deprive him of occasions to exhibit his ability as a military commander. In 1458 the death of both Alfonso and of his beloved illegitimate son, Buonconte, did not help to raise Federico&#x27;s mood. His fortunes recovered when Pius II, a man of culture like him, became Pope and made him Gonfaloniere of the Holy Roman Church. After some notable exploits in the Kingdom of Naples, he fought in the Marche against Malatesta, soundly defeating him at the Cesano river near Senigallia (1462). The following year he captured Fano and Senigallia, taking Sigismondo Pandolfo prisoner. The Pope made him vicar of the conquered territories.
In 1464 the new Pope Paul II called him to push back the Anguillara, from whom he regained much of the northern Lazio for Papal control. The following year he captured Cesena and Bertinoro in Romagna. In 1466 Francesco Sforza died, and Federico assisted his young son Galeazzo Sforza in the government of Milan, and also commanded the campaign against Bartolomeo Colleoni. In 1467 he took part in the Battle of Molinella. In 1469, on the death of Sigismondo Pandolfo, Paul sent him to occupy Rimini: however, fearing that an excessive Papal power in the area could also menace his home base of Urbino, once having entered Rimini Federico kept it for himself. After defeating the Papal forces in a great battle on 30 August 1469, he ceded it to Sigismondo&#x27;s son, Roberto Malatesta.

The matter was solved by the election of Pope Sixtus IV, who married his favourite nephew Giovanni Della Rovere to Federico&#x27;s daughter Giovanna and gave him the title of Duke of Urbino in 1474; Malatesta married his other daughter Elisabetta. Now Federico fought against his former patrons the Florentines, caught in the Pope&#x27;s attempt to carve out a state for his nephew Girolamo Riario. In 1478, Federico was involved in the Pazzi conspiracy; in the aftermath of the failed plot, he carried out attacks on the territory of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici.

However, after the death of his beloved second wife Battista Sforza (daughter of Elisabetta Malatesta and Alessandro Sforza), who died from pneumonia after giving birth to their seventh child at 25 years old, he spent much of his time in the magnificent palace in Urbino. The Duke had lost the mate he described as &quot;the delight of my public and private hours&quot;; a contemporary, speaking of their relationship, had called them two souls in one body. In 1482 he was called to command the army of Ercole I of Ferrara in his war against Venice, but was struck by fever and died in Ferrara in September.

Federico&#x27;s son, Guidobaldo, was married to Elisabetta Gonzaga, the brilliant and educated daughter of Federico I Gonzaga, lord of Mantua. With Guidobaldo&#x27;s death in 1508, the duchy of Urbino passed through Giovanna to the papal family of Della Rovere—nephews of Guidobaldo.

==Achievements==
=== Arts patronage ===
Federico, nicknamed &quot;the Light of Italy&quot;, is a landmark figure in the history of the Italian Renaissance for his contributions to enlightened culture. He imposed justice and stability on his tiny state through the principles of his humanist education; he engaged the best copyists and editors in his private scriptorium to produce the most comprehensive library outside of the Vatican; he supported the development of fine artists, including the early training of the young painter Raphael. He was a patron of the writer Cristoforo Landino.
Federico commissioned for himself a &quot;studiolo&quot; (a small study or cabinet for contemplation) in both his palace at Urbino and that at Gubbio; both are celebrated for their &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; decoration executed in marquetry. The former is still in situ, the latter was eventually purchased by and brought in its entirety to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 

===Role in society===
Federico took care of soldiers who might be killed or wounded, providing, for example, dowries for their daughters. He often strolled the streets of Urbino unarmed and unattended, inquiring in shops and businesses as to the well-being of the residents of Urbino. All &quot;citizens&quot;, defined exclusively – as in ancient Greece – as the male residents of Urbino, were equal under the law regardless of rank. 

His academic interests were the classics, particularly history and philosophy.

All his personal and professional achievements were financed through mercenary warfare. Commentators insist on his dedication to the well-being of his soldiers explaining why his men proved loyal to him and why Federico technically never lost a war. He was decorated with almost every military honour. Edward IV of England made him a Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter; he wears the Garter bound round his left knee in the portrait by Pedro Berruguete.

<text>Radioactive contamination, also called radiological pollution, is the deposition of, or presence of radioactive substances on surfaces or within solids, liquids, or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable (from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) definition).

Such contamination presents a hazard because the radioactive decay of the contaminants produces ionizing radiation (namely alpha, beta, gamma rays and free neutrons). The degree of hazard is determined by the concentration of the contaminants, the energy of the radiation being emitted, the type of radiation, and the proximity of the contamination to organs of the body. It is important to be clear that the contamination gives rise to the radiation hazard, and the terms &quot;radiation&quot; and &quot;contamination&quot; are not interchangeable.

The sources of radioactive pollution can be classified into two groups: natural and man-made. Following an atmospheric nuclear weapon discharge or a nuclear reactor containment breach, the air, soil, people, plants, and animals in the vicinity will become contaminated by nuclear fuel and fission products. A spilled vial of radioactive material like uranyl nitrate may contaminate the floor and any rags used to wipe up the spill. Cases of widespread radioactive contamination include the Bikini Atoll, the Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado, the area near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the area near the Chernobyl disaster, and the area near the Mayak disaster.

==Sources of contamination==

The sources of radioactive pollution can be natural or man-made.

Radioactive contamination can be due to a variety of causes. It may occur due to the release of radioactive gases, liquids or particles. For example, if a radionuclide used in nuclear medicine is spilled (accidentally or, as in the case of the Goiânia accident, through ignorance), the material could be spread by people as they walk around.

Radioactive contamination may also be an inevitable result of certain processes, such as the release of radioactive xenon in nuclear fuel reprocessing. In cases that radioactive material cannot be contained, it may be diluted to safe concentrations. For a discussion of environmental contamination by alpha emitters please see actinides in the environment.

Nuclear fallout is the distribution of radioactive contamination by the 520 atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place from the 1950s to the 1980s.

In nuclear accidents, a measure of the type and amount of radioactivity released, such as from a reactor containment failure, is known as the source term. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission defines this as &quot;Types and amounts of radioactive or hazardous material released to the environment following an accident.&quot;

Contamination does not include residual radioactive material remaining at a site after the completion of decommissioning. Therefore, radioactive material in sealed and designated containers is not properly referred to as contamination, although the units of measurement might be the same.

===Containment===

Containment is the primary way of preventing contamination from being released into the environment or coming into contact with or being ingested by humans.

Being within the intended Containment differentiates radioactive &quot;material&quot; from radioactive &quot;contamination&quot;. When radioactive materials are concentrated to a detectable level outside a containment, the area affected is generally referred to as &quot;contaminated&quot;.

There are a large number of techniques for containing radioactive materials so that it does not spread beyond the containment and become contaminated. In the case of liquids, this is by the use of high integrity tanks or containers, usually with a sump system so that leakage can be detected by radiometric or conventional instrumentation.

Where the material is likely to become airborne, then extensive use is made of the glovebox, which is a common technique in hazardous laboratory and process operations in many industries. The gloveboxes are kept under slight negative pressure and the vent gas is filtered in high-efficiency filters, which are monitored by radiological instrumentation to ensure they are functioning correctly.

===Naturally occurring radioactivity===

A variety of radionuclides occur naturally in the environment. Elements like uranium and thorium, and their decay products, are present in rock and soil. Potassium-40, a primordial nuclide, makes up a small percentage of all potassium and is present in the human body. Other nuclides, like carbon-14, which is present in all living organisms, are continuously created by cosmic rays.

These levels of radioactivity pose little bit danger but can confuse measurement. A particular problem is encountered with naturally generated radon gas which can affect instruments that are set to detect contamination close to normal background levels and can cause false alarms. Because of this skill is required by the operator of radiological survey equipment to differentiate between background radiation and the radiation which emanates from contamination.

Naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) can be brought to the surface or concentrated by human activities such as mining, oil and gas extraction, and coal consumption.

==Control and monitoring of contamination==

Radioactive contamination may exist on surfaces or in volumes of material or air, and specialized techniques are used to measure the levels of contamination by detection of the emitted radiation.

===Contamination monitoring===
Contamination monitoring depends entirely upon the correct and appropriate deployment and utilisation of radiation monitoring instruments.

====Surface contamination====
Surface contamination may either be fixed or &quot;free&quot;. In the case of fixed contamination, the radioactive material cannot by definition be spread, but its radiation is still measurable. In the case of free contamination, there is the hazard of contamination spread to other surfaces such as skin or clothing, or entrainment in the air. A concrete surface contaminated by radioactivity can be shaved to a specific depth, removing the contaminated material for disposal.

For occupational workers, controlled areas are established where there may be a contamination hazard. Access to such areas is controlled by a variety of barrier techniques, sometimes involving changes of clothing and footwear as required. The contamination within a controlled area is normally regularly monitored. Radiological protection instrumentation (RPI) plays a key role in monitoring and detecting any potential contamination spread, and combinations of hand held survey instruments and permanently installed area monitors such as Airborne particulate monitors and area gamma monitors are often installed. Detection and measurement of surface contamination of personnel and plant are normally by Geiger counter, scintillation counter or proportional counter. Proportional counters and dual phosphor scintillation counters can discriminate between alpha and beta contamination, but the Geiger counter cannot. Scintillation detectors are generally preferred for hand-held monitoring instruments and are designed with a large detection window to make monitoring of large areas faster. Geiger detectors tend to have small windows, which are more suited to small areas of contamination.

====Exit monitoring====
The spread of contamination by personnel exiting controlled areas in which nuclear material is used or processed is monitored by specialised installed exit control instruments such as frisk probes, hand contamination monitors and whole body exit monitors. These are used to check that persons exiting controlled areas do not carry contamination on their bodies or clothes.

In the United Kingdom, HSE has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct portable radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned. This covers all radiation instrument technologies and is a useful comparative guide for selecting the correct technology for the contamination type.

The UK NPL publishes a guide on the alarm levels to be used with instruments for checking personnel exiting controlled areas in which contamination may be encountered.
Surface contamination is usually expressed in units of radioactivity per unit of area for alpha or beta emitters. For SI, this is becquerels per square meter (or Bq/m2). Other units such as picoCuries per 100 cm2 or disintegrations per minute per square centimeter (1 dpm/cm2 = 167 Bq/m2) may be used.

===Airborne contamination===

The air can be contaminated with radioactive isotopes in particulate form, which poses a particular inhalation hazard. Respirators with suitable air filters or completely self-contained suits with their own air supply can mitigate these dangers.

Airborne contamination is measured by specialist radiological instruments that continuously pump the sampled air through a filter. Airborne particles accumulate on the filter and can be measured in a number of ways:

# The filter paper is periodically manually removed to an instrument such as a &quot;scaler&quot; which measures any accumulated radioactivity.
# The filter paper is static and is measured in situ by a radiation detector.
# The filter is a slowly moving strip and is measured by a radiation detector. These are commonly called &quot;moving filter&quot; devices and automatically advance the filter to present a clean area for accumulation, and thereby allow a plot of airborne concentration over time.

Commonly a semiconductor radiation detection sensor is used that can also provide spectrographic information on the contamination being collected.

A particular problem with airborne contamination monitors designed to detect alpha particles is that naturally occurring radon can be quite prevalent and may appear as contamination when low contamination levels are being sought. Modern instruments consequently have &quot;radon compensation&quot; to overcome this effect.

===Internal human contamination===

Radioactive contamination can enter the body through ingestion, inhalation, absorption, or injection. This will result in a committed dose.

For this reason, it is important to use personal protective equipment when working with radioactive materials. Radioactive contamination may also be ingested as the result of eating contaminated plants and animals or drinking contaminated water or milk from exposed animals. Following a major contamination incident, all potential pathways of internal exposure should be considered.

Successfully used on Harold McCluskey, chelation therapy and other treatments exist for internal radionuclide contamination.

==Decontamination==
Cleaning up contamination results in radioactive waste unless the radioactive material can be returned to commercial use by reprocessing. In some cases of large areas of contamination, the contamination may be mitigated by burying and covering the contaminated substances with concrete, soil, or rock to prevent further spread of the contamination to the environment. If a person&#x27;s body is contaminated by ingestion or by injury and standard cleaning cannot reduce the contamination further, then the person may be permanently contaminated.

Contamination control products have been used by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the commercial nuclear industry for decades to minimize contamination on radioactive equipment and surfaces and fix contamination in place. &quot;Contamination control products&quot; is a broad term that includes fixatives, strippable coatings, and decontamination gels. A &quot;fixative&quot; product functions as a permanent coating to stabilize residual loose/transferable radioactive contamination by fixing it in place; this aids in preventing the spread of contamination and reduces the possibility of the contamination becoming airborne, reducing workforce exposure and facilitating future deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) activities. &quot;Strippable coating&quot; products are loosely adhered to paint-like films and are used for their decontamination abilities. They are applied to surfaces with loose/transferable radioactive contamination and then, once dried, are peeled off, which removes the loose/transferable contamination along with the product. The residual radioactive contamination on the surface is significantly reduced once the strippable coating is removed. Modern strippable coatings show high decontamination efficiency and can rival traditional mechanical and chemical decontamination methods. &quot;Decontamination gels&quot; work in much the same way as other strippable coatings. The results obtained through the use of contamination control products are variable and depend on the type of substrate, the selected contamination control product, the contaminants, and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).

Some of the largest areas committed to be decontaminated are in the Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. The national government is under pressure to clean up radioactivity due to the Fukushima nuclear accident of March 2011 from as much land as possible so that some of the 110,000 displaced people can return. Stripping out the key radioisotope threatening health (caesium-137) from low-level waste could also dramatically decrease the volume of waste requiring special disposal. A goal is to find techniques that might be able to strip out 80 to 95% of the caesium from contaminated soil and other materials, efficiently and without destroying the organic content in the soil. One being investigated is termed hydrothermal blasting. The caesium is broken away from soil particles and then precipitated with ferric ferricyanide (Prussian blue). It would be the only component of the waste requiring special burial sites. The aim is to get annual exposure from the contaminated environment down to one millisievert (mSv) above background. The most contaminated area where radiation doses are greater than 50 mSv/year must remain off-limits, but some areas that are currently less than 5 mSv/year may be decontaminated allowing 22,000 residents to return.

To help protect people living in geographical areas which have been radioactively contaminated, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has published a guide: &quot;Publication 111 – Application of the Commission&#x27;s Recommendations to the Protection of People Living in Long-term Contaminated Areas after a Nuclear Accident or a Radiation Emergency&quot;.

==Contamination hazards==
===Low-level contamination===
The hazards to people and the environment from radioactive contamination depend on the nature of the radioactive contaminant, the level of contamination, and the extent of the spread of contamination. Low levels of radioactive contamination pose little risk, but can still be detected by radiation instrumentation. If a survey or map is made of a contaminated area, random sampling locations may be labeled with their activity in becquerels or curies on contact. Low levels may be reported in counts per minute using a scintillation counter.

In the case of low-level contamination by isotopes with a short half-life, the best course of action may be to simply allow the material to naturally decay. Longer-lived isotopes should be cleaned up and properly disposed of because even a very low level of radiation can be life-threatening when in long exposure to it.

Facilities and physical locations that are deemed to be contaminated may be cordoned off by a health physicist and labeled &quot;Contaminated area.&quot; Persons coming near such an area would typically require anti-contamination clothing (&quot;anti-Cs&quot;).

===High-level contamination===
High levels of contamination may pose major risks to people and the environment. People can be exposed to potentially lethal radiation levels, both externally and internally, from the spread of contamination following an accident (or a deliberate initiation) involving large quantities of radioactive material. The biological effects of external exposure to radioactive contamination are generally the same as those from an external radiation source not involving radioactive materials, such as x-ray machines, and are dependent on the absorbed dose.

When radioactive contamination is being measured or mapped &quot;in situ&quot;, any location that appears to be a point source of radiation is likely to be heavily contaminated. A highly contaminated location is colloquially referred to as a &quot;hot spot.&quot; On a map of a contaminated place, hot spots may be labeled with their &quot;on contact&quot; dose rate in mSv/h. In a contaminated facility, hot spots may be marked with a sign, shielded with bags of lead shot, or cordoned off with warning tape containing the radioactive trefoil symbol.


The hazard from contamination is the emission of ionizing radiation. The principal radiations which will be encountered are alpha, beta and gamma, but these have quite different characteristics. They have widely differing penetrating powers and radiation effects, and the accompanying diagram shows the penetration of these radiations in simple terms. For an understanding of the different ionising effects of these radiations and the weighting factors applied, see the article on absorbed dose.

Radiation monitoring involves the measurement of radiation dose or radionuclide contamination for reasons related to the assessment or control of exposure to radiation or radioactive substances, and the interpretation of the results. The methodological and technical details of the design and operation of environmental radiation monitoring programmes and systems for different radionuclides, environmental media and types of facility are given in IAEA Safety Standards Series No. RS–G-1.8 and in IAEA Safety Reports Series No. 64.

==Health effects of contamination==

===Biological effects===

Radioactive contamination by definition emits ionizing radiation, which can irradiate the human body from an external or internal origin.

====External irradiation====
This is due to radiation from contamination located outside the human body. The source can be in the vicinity of the body or can be on the skin surface. The level of health risk is dependent on duration and the type and strength of irradiation. Penetrating radiation such as gamma rays, X-rays, neutrons or beta particles pose the greatest risk from an external source. Low penetrating radiation such as alpha particles have a low external risk due to the shielding effect of the top layers of skin. See the article on sievert for more information on how this is calculated.

====Internal irradiation====
Radioactive contamination can be ingested into the human body if it is airborne or is taken in as contamination of food or drink, and will irradiate the body internally. The art and science of assessing internally generated radiation dose is Internal dosimetry.

The biological effects of ingested radionuclides depend greatly on the activity, the biodistribution, and the removal rates of the radionuclide, which in turn depends on its chemical form, the particle size, and route of entry. Effects may also depend on the chemical toxicity of the deposited material, independent of its radioactivity. Some radionuclides may be generally distributed throughout the body and rapidly removed, as is the case with tritiated water.

Some organs concentrate certain elements and hence radionuclide variants of those elements. This action may lead to much lower removal rates. For instance, the thyroid gland takes up a large percentage of any iodine that enters the body. Large quantities of inhaled or ingested radioactive iodine may impair or destroy the thyroid, while other tissues are affected to a lesser extent. Radioactive iodine-131 is a common fission product; it was a major component of the radioactivity released from the Chernobyl disaster, leading to nine fatal cases of pediatric thyroid cancer and hypothyroidism. On the other hand, radioactive iodine is used in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases of the thyroid precisely because of the thyroid&#x27;s selective uptake of iodine.

The radiation risk proposed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) predicts that an effective dose of one sievert (100 rem) carries a 5.5% chance of developing cancer. Such a risk is the sum of both internal and external radiation doses.

The ICRP states &quot;Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate the tissues over time periods determined by their physical half-life and their biological retention within the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues for many months or years after the intake. The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and the accumulation of radiation dose over extended periods of time has led to the definition of committed dose quantities&quot;.
The ICRP further states &quot;For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients&quot;.

The ICRP defines two dose quantities for individual committed dose:

Committed equivalent dose, H T(&quot;t&quot;) is the time integral of the equivalent dose rate in a particular tissue or organ that will be received by an individual following intake of radioactive material into the body by a Reference Person, where &quot;t&quot; is the integration time in years.
This refers specifically to the dose in a specific tissue or organ, in a similar way to external equivalent dose.

Committed effective dose, E(&quot;t&quot;) is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors &quot;W&quot;T, where &quot;t&quot; is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children. This refers specifically to the dose to the whole body, in a similar way to external effective dose.

===Social and psychological effects===
A 2015 report in &quot;Lancet&quot; explained that serious impacts of nuclear accidents were often not directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and psychological effects. The consequences of low-level radiation are often more psychological than radiological. Because damage from very low-level radiation cannot be detected, people exposed to it are left in anguished uncertainty about what will happen to them. Many believe they have been fundamentally contaminated for life and may refuse to have children for fear of birth defects. They may be shunned by others in their community who fear a sort of mysterious contagion.

Forced evacuation from a radiological or nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that &quot;the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date&quot;. Frank N. von Hippel, a U.S. scientist, commented on 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying that &quot;fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas&quot;. Evacuation and long-term displacement of affected populations create problems for many people, especially the elderly and hospital patients.

Such great psychological danger does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by, for example, the daily emissions from coal burning, although, as a National Academy of Sciences study found, this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the US population of 317,413,000. Medical errors leading to death in U.S. hospitals are estimated to be between 44,000 and 98,000. It is &quot;only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden – for it carries a unique historical legacy&quot;.

<doc id="621750" wikidata="Q3356065" url="?curid=621750" title="Parachurch organization">
<text>Parachurch organizations are Christian faith-based organizations that work outside and across denominations to engage in social welfare and evangelism. Parachurch organizations seek to come alongside the church and specialize in things that individual churches may not be able to specialize in by themselves. They often cross denominational and national boundaries providing specialized services and training.

==Definition==
These bodies can be businesses, non-profit corporations, or private associations. Most parachurch organizations, at least those normally called &quot;parachurch&quot;, are Protestant or Evangelical. Some of these organizations cater to a defined spectrum among evangelical beliefs, but most are self-consciously interdenominational and many are ecumenical.

In Protestant and Catholic theology parachurch organizations are termed sodality, as distinct from modality, which is the structure and organization of the local or universal church.

==Roles and organizations==

Parachurch organizations perform a number of roles, including: 
* evangelistic crusade associations (patterned after the Billy Graham Association)
* evangelistic and discipleship ministries (such as ThereforeGo Ministries, Youth With a Mission (YWAM), InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Scripture Union, Cru, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Christian Challenge, and The Navigators)
* music and print publishers, radio and television stations, film studios, online ministries 
* study centers and institutes, schools, colleges and universities
* political and social activist groups
* welfare and social services, including homeless shelters, child care, and domestic violence, disaster relief programs, and food pantries and clothing closets, and emergency aid centers (such as the City Missions)
* self-help groups
* Bible study groups

==Evangelical parachurch growth==
Evangelical parachurch organizations proliferated as a byproduct of the fundamentalist–modernist controversy. As modernist views penetrated mainline churches, those with more fundamentalist views who elected to stay reached across denominational boundaries for opportunities for Christian fellowship and outreach. While most parachurch organizations involved in social work operated in a collaborative mode, those engaged in evangelistic and discipleship ministries, particularly on college campuses, have at times been in fierce competition. Seeking to resolve such issues, Campus Crusade for Christ, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, the Navigators, and Young Life signed the &quot;Trail West Agreement&quot;, pledging mutual respect. The agreement was renewed in 2010 with thirteen additional signers as the &quot;Chicago Agreement&quot;. according to a student&#x27;s thesis from 2019.

<text>Jean Louis Cabanis (8 March 1816 – 20 February 1906) was a German ornithologist. He worked at the bird collections of the Natural History Museum in Berlin becoming its first curator of birds in 1850. He founded the &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot; in 1853&quot;.&quot;

== Biography ==
Cabanis was born in Berlin to an old Huguenot family who had moved from France. His father Benoit-Jean (1774–1838) and mother Maria Luise (1783–1849) both came from families that were in the textile industry. Little is known of his early life. He studied at the University of Berlin from 1835 to 1839, and then travelled to North America, working as a museum assistant in Carolina. He returned in 1841 with a large natural history collection. He was assistant at the Natural History Museum of Berlin (which was at the time the Berlin University Museum) and in 1850 he became the curator of birds, taking over from Martin Lichtenstein. Charles Lucien Bonaparte had offered him a position at the Jardin des Plantes but Cabanis turned it down. He founded the &quot;Journal für Ornithologie&quot; in 1853, editing it for the next forty-one years, when he was succeeded by his son-in-law Anton Reichenow. Cabanis considered the journal &quot;Naumannia&quot;, the official organ of the Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft, edited by Eduard Baldamus, as too narrow in its geographic scope and its German centricity.

Cabanis married Jeanne daughter of Ambrosius Rinaldi in Berlin in 1849. They had six sons and three daughters. He died in Friedrichshagen.

A number of birds are named after him, including Cabanis&#x27;s bunting &quot;Emberiza cabanisi&quot;, Cabanis&#x27;s spinetail &quot;Synallaxis cabanisi&quot;, Azure-rumped tanager &quot;Poecilostreptus cabanisi&quot; and Cabanis&#x27;s greenbul &quot;Phyllastrephus cabanisi&quot;.

<text>Heathrow Airport Holdings is a company that operates and manages Heathrow Airport based in London, England. It was formed by the privatisation of the British Airports Authority as BAA plc as part of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s privatisation of government-owned assets, and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. 
BAA plc was bought in 2006 by a consortium led by Ferrovial, a Spanish firm specialising in the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of transport, urban and services infrastructure. In March 2009, the company was eventually required to sell Gatwick and Stansted airports. Eventually, over the following years BAA sold all its airports other than Heathrow. The company was renamed Heathrow Airport Holdings in 2012 to reflect its main business.

The company&#x27;s head office is in the Compass Centre, on the grounds of Heathrow Airport in the London Borough of Hillingdon. The company makes money from charging landing fees and departing passenger levies to airlines, and from ancillary operations within those airports such as retail, car parking and property.

==History==
===British Airports Authority===
The British Airports Authority was established by the Airport Authority Act 1965, to take responsibility for four state-owned airports from the Ministry of Aviation – Heathrow Airport, Gatwick Airport, Prestwick Airport and Stansted Airport. In the following few years, the authority acquired Edinburgh Airport (1971), Glasgow Airport (1975) and Aberdeen Airport (1975). The authority took on the Ministry of Civil Aviation Constabulary in 1966, which was renamed to become the British Airports Authority Constabulary, and was disbanded between 1974 and 1975.

As part of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s moves to privatise government owned assets, the Airports Act 1986 was passed which mandated the creation of BAA plc as a vehicle by which stock market funds could be raised. The initial capitalisation of BAA plc was £1,225 million. In the early 1990s, the company sold Prestwick International Airport (now known as Glasgow Prestwick Airport).

===International operations and takeover===
BAA won a contract to manage the retail operations at Pittsburgh International Airport in 1991 under their BAA USA subsidiary. In December 2005, BAA made a winning bid of £1.2 billion for a 75% stake in Budapest Ferihegy International Airport, the largest airport in Hungary, which was being privatised by the Hungarian government.

In July 2006, BAA was taken over by a consortium led by Ferrovial, following a bid which valued the company at £10.1 billion ($20 billion). As a result, the company was delisted from the London Stock Exchange (where it had previously been part of the FTSE 100 Index) on 15 August 2006. Following the take-over, the decision was made to sell the stake in Ferihegy and this was completed in June 2007, when a consortium led by Hochtief AirPort of Germany purchased the stake.

BAA expanded into international operations, including retail contracts at Boston Logan International Airport and Baltimore-Washington International Airport (through its subsidiary BAA USA, Inc.), and a management contract with the City of Indianapolis to run the Indianapolis International Airport (as BAA Indianapolis, Inc.) before ultimately selling off its US division to Prospect Capital Corporation in July 2010.

===Divestitures===

After an inquiry which ran from August 2008 to March 2009, the UK Competition Commission announced that BAA would be required to sell three of the seven UK airports it owned at the time within two years, over fears the monopoly position held by BAA over London and Scotland&#x27;s airports could have &quot;adverse effects for both passengers and airlines&quot;. These were Gatwick, Stansted and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports. The sales were forecast to raise between £3.5bn and £40bn.

BAA announced plans to sell Gatwick Airport on 17 September 2009. At that time, the airport was valued at £1.8bn by regulators and it appeared that several firms including Macquarie Group, Manchester Airports Group, Fraport and Virgin Atlantic were interested in this sale, either on their own or as part of a consortium of companies. Ferrovial and its partners (Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) had been seeking £1.8bn to £2bn when they opened the bidding process.

Eventually, the sale was confirmed on 21 October 2009 and formally completed on 3 December 2009, for a fee of £1.51 billion, almost 25 per cent less than BAA had expected Gatwick would fetch when the sale was announced a year previously. BAA sold the airport to Global Infrastructure Partners, the fund backed by Credit Suisse and General Electric, who also operate London City Airport. Ferrovial, the majority holder in BAA, said that it expected to make a capital loss of around 142 million euros (US$212.6 million) against its consolidated earnings following the sale.

In October 2011, BAA announced that Edinburgh Airport would be put up for sale in early 2012 with an aim to handing over the running of the site to a new owner by summer 2012. Numerous groups were reported to have expressed interest, including a consortium of Scottish businesses headed by former Edinburgh Airport Manager, and Fraport, the owners of Frankfurt Airport, Germany. The airport was sold to Global Infrastructure Partners in 2012. Later that year, the company name was changed to Heathrow Airport Holdings Limited.

In January 2013, it was announced that Stansted would be sold to the Manchester Airports Group, a holding company owned by the 10 borough councils of Greater Manchester.

In May 2014, Heathrow Airport Holdings announced the appointment of John Holland-Kaye, current Development Director, as chief executive officer, succeeding Colin Matthews on 1 July 2014. The company agreed on 16 October 2014 to sell Glasgow, Southampton and Aberdeen airports to AGS Airports, a consortium of Ferrovial and Macquarie Group for £1 billion, in order to focus solely on Heathrow.

In January 2024, Ferrovial announced it would sell its shareholding to Ardian and the Public Investment Fund, subject to approval by regulatory bodies and rights which may be exercised by other shareholders. On 15 December 2024, it was reported that Ardian and the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia have successfully acquired 22.6% and 15% respectively of stakes in Heathrow Airport for a combined US$4.12 billion through Ferrovial and other shareholders in FGP TopCo. 

=== Effects of COVID-19 pandemic ===
As of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic which enormously reduced air travel, the company had debts of over £17 billion to banks and bondholders. It is amongst the highest indebted UK companies, though 90% of its shares are held overseas. Its request in October 2020 to increase airport charges was rejected by the Civil Aviation Authority.

==Corporate affairs==

As BAA, the company stated that its name did not stand for anything. It was still widely referred to as the &quot;British Airports Authority&quot; by both the media and the public, though the Authority was dissolved following the 1986 privatisation. BAA should not be confused with BA, the abbreviation of British Airways.

The company&#x27;s former logo, composed of three green triangles, was created by John Lloyd and Jim Northover of the design consultancy Lloyd Northover, at the time of the privatisation in 1986.

The original BAA plc was acquired in 2006 by Airport Development and Investment Limited (ADI), a new company formed by the Ferrovial consortium. In October 2008, ADI changed its name to BAA Limited, and on 15 October 2012, the company announced that it had changed its name to Heathrow Airport Holdings. Colin Matthews, Chief Executive of the company, said that, given the reduction in the number of airports owned by the company, the BAA name was no longer appropriate; after the sale of Stansted, Heathrow Airport would account for 95% of the company&#x27;s business. Each remaining airport owned by the company reverted to operating under its own name rather than the BAA banner.

As a major client of the UK construction industry, it is a member of the Construction Clients&#x27; Group, which represents client views to the government&#x27;s Strategic Forum for Construction.

=== Ownership===
===Head office===

The company&#x27;s head office is located in the Compass Centre on the grounds of Heathrow Airport in Hounslow. The Compass Centre previously served as a British Airways flight crew centre. When Heathrow Terminal 5 opened on 27 March 2008, British Airways staff, including crew check-in staff, relocated from the Compass Centre to Terminal 5.

The original BAA plc&#x27;s head office was located near London Victoria station in the City of Westminster, London.

===Flying matters===
BAA was a founding member of Flying Matters, a coalition of business groups, trade unions, tourism groups and the aviation industry (airports, airlines, aerospace manufacturers and air traffic control) launched in June 2007 to &quot;balance the argument around issues of aviation and climate change&quot; arguing that aviation does not contribute significantly to climate change, and that an expansion of aviation will aid the developing world, benefit social justice, and is essential for UK tourism and for the UK economy. The group was dissolved in April 2011 after several members, including BAA, left the coalition.

===Expansion of Heathrow Airport===

Since 2009 the company has been progressing a plan to build a third runway to expand Heathrow Airport. This requires government approval, and on 5 June 2018 the Cabinet approved the third runway, with a full vote planned for Parliament. The financing of the expansion has yet to be arranged, with Heathrow Airport Holdings&#x27; finances already highly leveraged. In 2017 borrowings were £13.4 billion, with shareholders&#x27; equity at £0.7 billion.

==Controversies==

===Heathrow management===
The company has received criticism for prioritising shops over extra security aisles at Heathrow. After much criticism for this, BAA removed some shops to provide extra security lanes. &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote that retail is important for BAA at Heathrow because, by law, landing charges are much less than those of similar-scope airports and shops help make up the difference.

BAA has been accused of under-investing in snow and ice-fighting technology at Heathrow, which led to runway closures and severe delays in December 2010.

In July 2019, Unite threatened a strike over pay after growing frustration on pay inequality. Whilst the CEO John Holland-Kaye was awarded a 103% pay rise from £2,100,000 to £4,200,000, staff have been denied a 4.5% increase.

===Heathrow protest injunction===
In July 2007, BAA sought an injunction preventing potential protesters involved in the Camp for Climate Action from approaching Heathrow Airport. The injunction specifically targeted anyone belonging to, or protesting in the name of, AirportWatch, The No Third Runway Action Group and Plane Stupid. Airport Watch members included Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the World Development Movement, the National Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds – all of whom were caught by what was described as the &#x27;Mother of all Injunctions&#x27;. 

BAA denied seeking a blanket ban on airport protest. In the end they won a more limited injunction, and the camp went ahead amid considerable worldwide publicity. Afterwards, Duncan Bonfield, BAA director of corporate affairs, and Mark Mann, BAA head of media relations, resigned.

===General aviation===
BAA&#x27;s pricing structure mostly excludes General aviation access to their airports by either banning the movements of light aircraft, or setting high fees and mandatory handling charges. The total charges for landing, one night of parking, and mandatory handling for a Cessna 152 (including VAT) in 2013 was £234 at Aberdeen, £193 at Glasgow, and £187 at Southampton. Heathrow Airport does not permit any flights for recreational, commemorative, charity and record breaking purposes, light twin-engine private aircraft and all light single-engine aircraft.

BAA has since taken steps to improve this issue, including the waiving of mandatory handling fees for light aircraft at Aberdeen and Southampton. In 2014, the equivalent charges were £29.65 at Southampton and £64.63 at Aberdeen. However, the fees remained the same at Glasgow. It was also acknowledged that Heathrow Airport&#x27;s runways are used at 99% of their capacity, and therefore the charges were set on the basis of very high demand and the lack of supply.

<text>Marjorie Ruth Rice (née Jeuck; 1923–2017) was an American amateur mathematician most famous for her discoveries of pentagonal tilings in geometry.

==Background==
Rice was born February 16, 1923, in St. Petersburg, Florida.

Marjorie Rice was a San Diego mother of five, who had become an ardent follower of Martin Gardner&#x27;s long-running column, &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;, which appeared monthly, 1957–1986, in the pages of &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine. By the 1970s, Gardner was a popular science writer and amateur mathematician. Rice said later that she would rush to grab each issue from the mail before anyone else could get it, especially her son who subscribed to the magazine.

In 1975, Rice read Gardner&#x27;s July column, &quot;On Tessellating the Plane with Convex Polygon Tiles&quot;, that discussed what kinds of convex polygons can fit together perfectly without any overlaps or gaps to fill the plane. In his column, Gardner indicated that &quot;the task of finding all convex polygons that tile the plane …. was not completed until 1967 when Richard Brandon Kershner … found three pentagonal tilers that had been missed by all predecessors who had worked on the problem&quot;. Gardner was repeating Kershner&#x27;s claim that the list of convex pentagon tilers was complete. But within a month, Gardner received an example, by one of his readers, Richard James III, of a new convex pentagon tiler, and published this news in his December 1975 column.

==Discoveries of pentagonal tilings ==
Inspired by this new discovery, Rice decided to try to find other new pentagon tilers. Despite having only a high-school education, but a keen interest in art, she began devoting her free time to discovering new pentagonal tilings, ways to tile a plane using pentagons. She worked on the problem in her free time and through the 1975 holiday season &quot;by drawing diagrams on the kitchen table when no one was around and hiding them when her husband and children came home, or when friends stopped by&quot;. She even developed her own system of notation to represent the constraints on and relationships between the sides and angles of the pentagons.

By February 1976, she had discovered a new pentagon type and its variations in shape and drew up several tessellations by these pentagon tiles. She mailed her discoveries to Gardner using her own home-made notation. He, in turn, sent Rice&#x27;s work to Doris Schattschneider, an expert in tiling patterns, who was skeptical at first, saying that Rice&#x27;s idiosyncratic notation system seemed odd, like &quot;hieroglyphics&quot;. But with careful examination, she was able to validate Rice&#x27;s results.

By October 1976, Rice had discovered 58 pentagon tilings that needed two pentagons stuck together in order to tile &quot;transitively&quot; (most of them previously unknown), which she arranged into 12 classes. By December 1976, she had discovered two additional new types of tessellating pentagons and over 75 distinct tessellations by pentagons that were in blocks that could be seen as &quot;double hexagons&quot;. In December 1977, she made her fourth discovery of a new type of pentagon tiler and by then had enumerated 103 &quot;2-block transitive&quot; pentagon tilings. In the following decade, she discovered several more tiling patterns by pentagons and explored aperiodic tilings.

Rice had a keen interest in art, and had completed half of a correspondence course in commercial art before she married. Throughout her investigations, she explored how to use pentagonal tilings as grids on which to overlay tessellations of flowers, shells, butterflies and bees.

Rice&#x27;s discoveries were never published in Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Scientific American&quot; columns, but were revealed in an addendum to his original column that was included in his 1988 collection of columns, where he declared her discoveries &quot;fantastic achievements&quot;.

&quot;Much of Rice’s investigations remain unpublished, in that only the &quot;product&quot; of her investigations are shown. How she devised these is not generally shown. However, some of her investigations are indeed shown in &quot;The Mathematical Gardner&quot;, a compilation of articles in honour of the late Martin Gardner, with Doris Schattschneider’s article &quot;In Praise of Amateurs&quot; (mostly concerning background detail on Rice’s pentagon tiling findings), pages 140-166. Pages 154-155 contain numerous convex pentagon tilings&quot;.

Rice&#x27;s archival fonds are at the University of Calgary Library, Alberta, Canada, in the &quot;Eugène Strens Recreational Mathematics Collection&quot;.

==Four pentagonal tiling classes discovered by Marjorie Rice==

==Recognition while alive==
Doris Schattschneider, who helped Martin Gardner popularize the pentagon tiling discoveries of Rice, lauded her work as exciting discoveries by an amateur mathematician.

In 1995, at a regional meeting of the Mathematical Association of America held in Los Angeles, Schattschneider convinced Rice and her husband to attend her lecture on Rice&#x27;s work. Before concluding her talk, Schattschneider introduced the amateur mathematician who had advanced the study of tessellation. &quot;And everybody in the room . . . gave her a standing ovation.&quot;

==Legacy==
* In 1999, one of Rice&#x27;s tilings became the basis for the floor in the foyer of the headquarters of the Mathematical Association of America in Washington, D.C.
* Rice&#x27;s papers and materials in support of her mathematical discoveries are preserved at the Eugène Strens Recreational Mathematics Collection at the University of Calgary Library, Alberta, Canada.

==Personal life==
Marjorie Ruth Jeuck married Gilbert Rice in 1945. She had six children, of whom one did not live past infancy.

Rice died July 2, 2017, in San Diego, California.

<text>In mathematics, low-dimensional topology is the branch of topology that studies manifolds, or more generally topological spaces, of four or fewer dimensions. Representative topics are the structure theory of 3-manifolds and 4-manifolds, knot theory, and braid groups. This can be regarded as a part of geometric topology. It may also be used to refer to the study of topological spaces of dimension 1, though this is more typically considered part of continuum theory.

==History==
A number of advances starting in the 1960s had the effect of emphasising low dimensions in topology. The solution by Stephen Smale, in 1961, of the Poincaré conjecture in five or more dimensions made dimensions three and four seem the hardest; and indeed they required new methods, while the freedom of higher dimensions meant that questions could be reduced to computational methods available in surgery theory. Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture, formulated in the late 1970s, offered a framework that suggested geometry and topology were closely intertwined in low dimensions, and Thurston&#x27;s proof of geometrization for Haken manifolds utilized a variety of tools from previously only weakly linked areas of mathematics. Vaughan Jones&#x27; discovery of the Jones polynomial in the early 1980s not only led knot theory in new directions but gave rise to still mysterious connections between low-dimensional topology and mathematical physics. In 2002, Grigori Perelman announced a proof of the three-dimensional Poincaré conjecture, using Richard S. Hamilton&#x27;s Ricci flow, an idea belonging to the field of geometric analysis.

Overall, this progress has led to better integration of the field into the rest of mathematics.

==Two dimensions==
A surface is a two-dimensional, topological manifold. The most familiar examples are those that arise as the boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional Euclidean space R3—for example, the surface of a ball. On the other hand, there are surfaces, such as the Klein bottle, that cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space without introducing singularities or self-intersections.

===Classification of surfaces===
The &quot;classification theorem of closed surfaces&quot; states that any connected closed surface is homeomorphic to some member of one of these three families:

# the sphere;
# the connected sum of &quot;g&quot; tori, for formula_1;
# the connected sum of &quot;k&quot; real projective planes, for formula_2.

The surfaces in the first two families are orientable. It is convenient to combine the two families by regarding the sphere as the connected sum of 0 tori. The number &quot;g&quot; of tori involved is called the &quot;genus&quot; of the surface. The sphere and the torus have Euler characteristics 2 and 0, respectively, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of &quot;g&quot; tori is .

The surfaces in the third family are nonorientable. The Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is 1, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of &quot;k&quot; of them is .

===Teichmüller space===
In mathematics, the Teichmüller space &quot;TX&quot; of a (real) topological surface &quot;X&quot;, is a space that parameterizes complex structures on &quot;X&quot; up to the action of homeomorphisms that are isotopic to the identity homeomorphism. Each point in &quot;TX&quot; may be regarded as an isomorphism class of &#x27;marked&#x27; Riemann surfaces where a &#x27;marking&#x27; is an isotopy class of homeomorphisms from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;X&quot;. 
The Teichmüller space is the universal covering orbifold of the (Riemann) moduli space.

Teichmüller space has a canonical complex manifold structure and a wealth of natural metrics. The underlying topological space of Teichmüller space was studied by Fricke, and the Teichmüller metric on it was introduced by .

===Uniformization theorem===
In mathematics, the uniformization theorem says that every simply connected Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to one of the three domains: the open unit disk, the complex plane, or the Riemann sphere. In particular it admits a Riemannian metric of constant curvature. This classifies Riemannian surfaces as elliptic (positively curved—rather, admitting a constant positively curved metric), parabolic (flat), and hyperbolic (negatively curved) according to their universal cover.

The uniformization theorem is a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem from proper simply connected open subsets of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces.

==Three dimensions==
A topological space &quot;X&quot; is a 3-manifold if every point in &quot;X&quot; has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to Euclidean 3-space.

The topological, piecewise-linear, and smooth categories are all equivalent in three dimensions, so little distinction is made in whether we are dealing with say, topological 3-manifolds, or smooth 3-manifolds.

Phenomena in three dimensions can be strikingly different from phenomena in other dimensions, and so there is a prevalence of very specialized techniques that do not generalize to dimensions greater than three. This special role has led to the discovery of close connections to a diversity of other fields, such as knot theory, geometric group theory, hyperbolic geometry, number theory, Teichmüller theory, topological quantum field theory, gauge theory, Floer homology, and partial differential equations. 3-manifold theory is considered a part of low-dimensional topology or geometric topology.

===Knot and braid theory===
Knot theory is the study of mathematical knots. While inspired by knots that appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician&#x27;s knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone. In mathematical language, a knot is an embedding of a circle in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, R3 (since we&#x27;re using topology, a circle isn&#x27;t bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its homeomorphisms). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of R3 upon itself (known as an ambient isotopy); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.

Knot complements are frequently-studied 3-manifolds. The knot complement of a tame knot &quot;K&quot; is the three-dimensional space surrounding the knot. To make this precise, suppose that &quot;K&quot; is a knot in a three-manifold &quot;M&quot; (most often, &quot;M&quot; is the 3-sphere). Let &quot;N&quot; be a tubular neighborhood of &quot;K&quot;; so &quot;N&quot; is a solid torus. The knot complement is then the complement of &quot;N&quot;,
:formula_3

A related topic is braid theory. Braid theory is an abstract geometric theory studying the everyday braid concept, and some generalizations. The idea is that braids can be organized into groups, in which the group operation is &#x27;do the first braid on a set of strings, and then follow it with a second on the twisted strings&#x27;. Such groups may be described by explicit presentations, as was shown by . For an elementary treatment along these lines, see the article on braid groups. Braid groups may also be given a deeper mathematical interpretation: as the fundamental group of certain configuration spaces.

===Hyperbolic 3-manifolds===
A hyperbolic 3-manifold is a 3-manifold equipped with a complete Riemannian metric of constant sectional curvature -1. In other words, it is the quotient of three-dimensional hyperbolic space by a subgroup of hyperbolic isometries acting freely and properly discontinuously. See also Kleinian model.

Its thick-thin decomposition has a thin part consisting of tubular neighborhoods of closed geodesics and/or ends that are the product of a Euclidean surface and the closed half-ray. The manifold is of finite volume if and only if its thick part is compact. In this case, the ends are of the form torus cross the closed half-ray and are called cusps. Knot complements are the most commonly studied cusped manifolds.

===Poincaré conjecture and geometrization===
Thurston&#x27;s geometrization conjecture states that certain three-dimensional topological spaces each have a unique geometric structure that can be associated with them. It is an analogue of the uniformization theorem for two-dimensional surfaces, which states that every simply-connected Riemann surface can be given one of three geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic).
In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure. The conjecture was proposed by , and implies several other conjectures, such as the Poincaré conjecture and Thurston&#x27;s elliptization conjecture.

==Four dimensions==
A 4-manifold is a 4-dimensional topological manifold. A smooth 4-manifold is a 4-manifold with a smooth structure. In dimension four, in marked contrast with lower dimensions, topological and smooth manifolds are quite different. There exist some topological 4-manifolds that admit no smooth structure and even if there exists a smooth structure it need not be unique (i.e. there are smooth 4-manifolds that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic).

4-manifolds are of importance in physics because, in General Relativity, spacetime is modeled as a pseudo-Riemannian 4-manifold.

===Exotic R4===
An exotic R4 is a differentiable manifold that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the Euclidean space R4. The first examples were found in the early 1980s by Michael Freedman, by using the contrast between Freedman&#x27;s theorems about topological 4-manifolds, and Simon Donaldson&#x27;s theorems about smooth 4-manifolds. There is a continuum of non-diffeomorphic differentiable structures of R4, as was shown first by Clifford Taubes.

Prior to this construction, non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on spheres—exotic spheres—were already known to exist, although the question of the existence of such structures for the particular case of the 4-sphere remained open (and still remains open to this day). For any positive integer &quot;n&quot; other than 4, there are no exotic smooth structures on R&quot;n&quot;; in other words, if &quot;n&quot; ≠ 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to R&quot;n&quot; is diffeomorphic to R&quot;n&quot;.

===Other special phenomena in four dimensions===
There are several fundamental theorems about manifolds that can be proved by low-dimensional methods in dimensions at most 3, and by completely different high-dimensional methods in dimension at least 5, but which are false in four dimensions. Here are some examples:

* In dimensions other than 4, the Kirby–Siebenmann invariant provides the obstruction to the existence of a PL structure; in other words a compact topological manifold has a PL structure if and only if its Kirby–Siebenmann invariant in H4(&quot;M&quot;,Z/2Z) vanishes. In dimension 3 and lower, every topological manifold admits an essentially unique PL structure. In dimension 4 there are many examples with vanishing Kirby–Siebenmann invariant but no PL structure.
* In any dimension other than 4, a compact topological manifold has only a finite number of essentially distinct PL or smooth structures. In dimension 4, compact manifolds can have a countable infinite number of non-diffeomorphic smooth structures.
* Four is the only dimension &quot;n&quot; for which R&quot;n&quot; can have an exotic smooth structure. R4 has an uncountable number of exotic smooth structures; see exotic R4.
* The solution to the smooth Poincaré conjecture is known in all dimensions other than 4 (it is usually false in dimensions at least 7; see exotic sphere). The Poincaré conjecture for PL manifolds has been proved for all dimensions other than 4, but it is not known whether it is true in 4 dimensions (it is equivalent to the smooth Poincaré conjecture in 4 dimensions).
* The smooth h-cobordism theorem holds for cobordisms provided that neither the cobordism nor its boundary has dimension 4. It can fail if the boundary of the cobordism has dimension 4 (as shown by Donaldson). If the cobordism has dimension 4, then it is unknown whether the h-cobordism theorem holds.
* A topological manifold of dimension not equal to 4 has a handlebody decomposition. Manifolds of dimension 4 have a handlebody decomposition if and only if they are smoothable.
* There are compact 4-dimensional topological manifolds that are not homeomorphic to any simplicial complex. In dimension at least 5 the existence of topological manifolds not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex was an open problem. In 2013, Ciprian Manolescu posted a preprint on the ArXiv showing that there are manifolds in each dimension greater than or equal to 5, that are not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex.

==A few typical theorems that distinguish low-dimensional topology==
There are several theorems that in effect state that many of the most basic tools used to study high-dimensional manifolds do not apply to low-dimensional manifolds, such as:

Steenrod&#x27;s theorem states that an orientable 3-manifold has a trivial tangent bundle. Stated another way, the only characteristic class of a 3-manifold is the obstruction to orientability.

Any closed 3-manifold is the boundary of a 4-manifold. This theorem is due independently to several people: it follows from the Dehn–Lickorish theorem via a Heegaard splitting of the 3-manifold. It also follows from René Thom&#x27;s computation of the cobordism ring of closed manifolds.

The existence of exotic smooth structures on R4. This was originally observed by Michael Freedman, based on the work of Simon Donaldson and Andrew Casson. It has since been elaborated by Freedman, Robert Gompf, Clifford Taubes and Laurence Taylor to show there exists a continuum of non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on R4. Meanwhile, Rn is known to have exactly one smooth structure up to diffeomorphism provided &quot;n&quot; ≠ 4.

<text>Baptiste Jules Henri Jacques Giffard (8 February 182514 April 1882) was a French engineer. In 1852 he invented the steam injector and the powered Giffard dirigible airship.

==Career==
Giffard was born in Paris in 1825. He invented the injector and the Giffard dirigible, an airship powered with a steam engine and weighing over . It was the world&#x27;s first passenger-carrying airship (then known as a dirigible, from French). Both practical and steerable, the hydrogen-filled airship was equipped with a steam engine that drove a propeller. The engine was fitted with a downward-pointing funnel. The exhaust steam was mixed in with the combustion gases and it was hoped by these means to stop sparks rising up to the gas bag; he also installed a vertical rudder.

On 24 September 1852, Giffard made the first powered and controlled flight travelling from Paris to Élancourt. The wind was too strong to allow him to make way against it, so he was unable to return to the start. However, he was able to make turns and circles, proving that a powered airship could be steered and controlled.

Giffard was granted a patent for the injector on 8 May 1858. Unusually, he had thoroughly worked out the theory of this invention before making any experimental instrument, having explained the idea in 1850. Others had worked on using jets, particularly Eugène Bourdon who patented a very similar device in 1857.

In 1863, he was appointed a Chevalier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

==Death and commemoration==
In response to his declining eyesight, Giffard killed himself in 1882, leaving his estate to the nation for humanitarian and scientific purposes.

<text>Pelageya Fedorovna Shajn, &quot;née&quot; Sannikova (Пелагея Фёдоровна Шайн) (22 September 1894 – 27 August 1956), was a Russian astronomer in the Soviet Union, and the first woman credited with the discovery of a minor planet, at the Simeiz Observatory in 1928. Pelageya also discovered numerous variable stars and co-discovered the periodic, Jupiter-family comet 61P/Shajn–Schaldach. She was married to prominent Soviet astronomer Grigory Shajn.

== Biography ==

Pelageya Shajn was born in 1894 to a peasant family in the village Ostanin located in the Solikamsky District of the Perm Governorate. She was the wife of prominent Soviet astronomer Grigory Shajn, who was also her colleague at the Simeiz Observatory. Her maiden name was Sannikova (Санникова). In 1928, she discovered the asteroid 1112 Polonia, the first minor planet to be discovered by a woman.

She died 27 August 1956, shortly after her husband had died on 4 August the same year.

== Awards and honors ==

Main-belt asteroid 1190 Pelagia, discovered in 1930 by Grigory Neujmin who worked at Simeiz, was named in her honor. In addition the asteroid 1648 Shajna was named in her and her husband&#x27;s memory, while the lunar crater &quot;Shayn&quot; was exclusively named after her husband.

== Discoveries ==

Her astronomical discoveries are credited under the name P. F. Shajn. As with her husband, her last name, &quot;Shajn&quot;, is sometimes given as &quot;Schajn&quot;, &quot;Shain&quot; or &quot;Shayn&quot;, the latter being the modern English transliteration.

Pelageya Shajn discovered 19 minor planets &quot;(see list below)&quot; and about 140 variable stars. In 1949, she also co-discovered 61P/Shajn–Schaldach, a periodic comet of the Jupiter family. However, the non-periodic comet C/1925 F1 (Shajn-Comas Solá; also known as Comet 1925 VI or Comet 1925a) was co-discovered by her husband rather than by her.

<doc id="621780" wikidata="Q5511770" url="?curid=621780" title="Füxa">
<text>Füxa (pronounced like the color fuchsia) is an American rock band.

Füxa was formed in Detroit in 1994 by musicians Randall Nieman (formerly of Windy &amp; Carl) and Ryan Anderson (formerly of Asha Vida and later to join Delta Waves). Band members include Randall Nieman (synths/ guitars/ percussion/ Space), Tom Meade (synths/ electronic percussion/ studio effects) Mark Refoy, Jonny Mattock and Stefan Persson. The band quickly achieved cult status with their split recordings with artists such as the Azusa Plane, The Telescopes, Martin Rev, Dean and Britta and Stereolab.

==History==
Füxa&#x27;s first collaborative effort, which was immediately bracketed within the psychedelic and experimental category, was a collection of short, guitar and synth driven, primal instrumental space rock songs, recorded at home on a borrowed 6-track cassette recorder. The tapes were later brought to friend Erik Kassab of Gravity Wax for mixing and mastering at his Mission Control home studio. The resulting masters totaled over 90 minutes, and the best hours worth of music was selected for their first release, a hand colored, labeled and numbered cassette. This tape was sold at local indie record shops, and quite a few copies were given away by the band. College DJ Lunar Larry played many selections from this tape on his Friday night program, &quot;The Life According to Larry&quot;, on WHFR radio. Nieman &amp; Anderson at that time began to play at Detroit coffee houses, quickly building a cult following with their brief, psychedelic, erratic performances. The duo performed with the assistance of an old, literally falling apart Korg Mono/Poly synthesizer, often left to its own devices to produce loud, random arpeggios throughout the entire performance, which almost always emulated in a drum circle where audience participation was encouraged to &quot;feel good&quot; with the band. It has been suggested that the Detroit-based experimental rock band focus on a lo-fi, electronics-heavy blend of droning, treated guitars, vintage synths, and sparse percussion in the vein of suicide, Spacemen 3 / Spiritualized, and neu!. Ryan Anderson departed from the outfit in 1998, and Randall Nieman took over Füxa as a solo project. In 2001-2003 Ryan Anderson Joined Delta Waves to play drums and perform on a few recordings.

==Releases==
Their debut single was the self-released split with friends Gravity Wax, followed by &quot;Free Your Soul&quot; EP, which featured the song, &quot;Photon&quot;. Füxa&#x27;s first full-length CD was a compilation of their first 3 singles, entitled &quot;3 Field Rotation&quot;, released by England&#x27;s Che Records in May 1996. To correspond with the release of the disc, the duo was invited over to London to play shows supporting the disc. Later that year, the band was featured on a split 7-inch with Stereolab, and performed a few shows with Stereolab in the United States. Other bands they have split recordings with include Azusa Plane, Orange Cake Mix, Flowchart and Bright. The band&#x27;s second full-length came out in late 1996, entitled &quot;Very Well Organized&quot; - a collection of songs composed around a 1963 Hammond organ situated in the band&#x27;s living room. 1997 saw the release of &quot;Venoy&quot;, a contribution to Darla Records famous Bliss-out series of EPs. The band also focused on the publication of their fanzine, &quot;Masstransfer&quot;, with the first issue arriving in November 1997. Fuxa&#x27;s swirling electronica and atmospheric downbeats are suggested to evoke a forgotten transient landscape.

Füxa&#x27;s first album in a decade, Electric Sound of Summer, was released on Rocket Girl in 2012. Both Britta Phillips and Dean Wareham (of Luna and, later, Dean &amp; Britta) donate vocals, as does Seefeel’s Sarah Peacock, while members of Spiritualized, Spacemen 3 and Spectrum all contribute. It is suggested to be the cross-pollination of these collaborators’ talents which gives Electric Sound of Summer its strength and bottomless depth. It was dubbed as a &quot;celebration of creativity; of community; of music past, present… and Füxa&quot;.

Comprising a sixteen-strong army of collaborators, including BJ Cole, Ann Shenton of Add N to (X), Judy Dyble and Britta Phillips. Füxa&#x27;s tenth full-length album, &quot;Dirty D&quot;, was released on Rocket Girl in 2013. It is suggested to display a penchant for swirling electronica and atmospheric downbeats that have been compiled in a way which is constantly pleasing to the ear. The dirty ‘D’ of the title could refer to a number of disquieting facets of today&#x27;s society – the dominance of Disney, the illusion of democracy, dereliction – and, in contrast to Disney&#x27;s sickly saccharine supremacy over our children&#x27;s imaginations.

<doc id="621793" wikidata="Q110264681" url="?curid=621793" title="North Fork Kentucky River">
<text>North Fork Kentucky River is a river in Kentucky in the United States.
It is a fork of the Kentucky River that it joins just upstream of Beattyville.
It is nearly long with an average slope of , and an overall basin size (at Jackson) of 

== Basin and hydrology ==
The river rises at Payne Gap in Letcher County, in the Appalachian plateaus, flowing initially westward past Whitesburg in the Kanawha section (of the Cumberland Plateau) north of Pine Mountain.
Several of its early tributaries flow off the north side of Pine Mountain into it, one of the principal ones being Cowan Creek.
The basin size within Letcher County is .

The discharge rate at Hazard varies seasonally, being high in the winter and spring and low in the summer and autumn.
This is brought about by higher rainfall during the first half of the calendar year, and regularly causes floods in the spring.

=== Water quality, and connections to mining ===
Half of one percent of the area of the North Fork Kentucky River basin has been disturbed by mining.
As a result of these land disturbances, the annual sediment yield for the North Fork basin is roughly 15 times the yield over the entire Kentucky River basin, at an estimated .
Three quarters of the sediment load is deposited between Jackson and Heidelberg, estimated by the USGS and KGS to be mostly just upstream of the latter.

Because of the mining, the North Fork is also one of the three major sources of dissolved solids in the Kentucky River system.
It is the origin of one third of the dissolved sulphates found in the Kentucky River, and the location of the highest concentrations of iron (more than 4 times the concentration over the whole Kentucky River basin), and manganese.
The measured increases in dissolved solids over the years 1976–1986, between 3% and 10% per year, matched the increase in coal production during those same years.

Calcium and magnesium cations, one of the causes of water hardness, are elevated in the North Fork because of surface mining disturbances of calcium and magnesium bearing rock, the overall Kentucky River system being classified as hard to very hard, with exceptions in tributaries that are unaffected by Eastern Kentucky Coalfield mining.
The North Fork is responsible for one third of the Kentucky River&#x27;s dissolved magnesium and one tenth of its dissolved calcium.

Not enough data are available to explain the elevated aluminium concentrations in the North Fork, as few samples have been taken with highly fluctuating measurements, but the elevated barium concentrations correlate with the suspended sediment measurements and are thus attributed to underclay disturbances caused by mining, as do its elevated copper concentrations which are thus likewise attributed.
The elevated concentrations of manganese are considered to be of natural origin, because although they are high in the mined parts of the North Fork basin, they are also high in other parts of the Kentucky River basin where there is no mining and no correlation with suspended sediment measurements.

=== Floods ===

The Kentucky River basin, including North Fork and its tributaries such as Troublesome, suffered a major flood in January and February 1957, although that did not exceed the highest on record for Troublesome itself at that point, which had been the flood of February 1939.
The worst hit place was Hazard; but most of the settlements along the various tributaries were damaged to some degree.

== Biota ==
The North Fork was the location of seven species of freshwater mussels as of 1975, and their habitat had suffered from significant reduction since the start of the 20th century.
The reservoir at Carr Fork has been classified as eutrophic because of the sedimentation.

Contrastingly, whilst Buckhorn Creek has been affected by mining activity, its biota were found to be surviving fairly well, with 42 species of fish observed in the 1960s and 1970s and several species of algae and benthic invertebrates.
It is an important recolonization source for downstream Troublesome Creek.

<text>June Gibbons (born 11 April 1963) and Jennifer Gibbons (11 April 1963 – 9 March 1993) were twin sisters who grew up in Wales. They became known as &quot;The Silent Twins&quot;, since they only communicated with each other. They wrote works of fiction. In 1981 the girls committed a crimes including vandalism, petty theft and arson, which led to them being admitted to Broadmoor Hospital high-security mental health hospital. The twins were sentenced to indefinite detention under the Mental Health Act 1983 and were held for 11 years.

== Early life ==
June and Jennifer were the daughters of Caribbean immigrants Gloria and Aubrey Gibbons. The Gibbons family moved from Barbados to the United Kingdom in the early 1960s, as part of the Windrush generation. Gloria was a housewife and Aubrey worked as a technician for the Royal Air Force. The couple also had three other children: Greta was born in 1957, David was born in 1959, and Rosie was born in 1967.

In 1960, Aubrey went to stay with a relative in Coventry and soon qualified as a staff technician. Gloria followed, with Greta and David, several months later. The twins were born on 11 April 1963, at a military hospital in Aden, Yemen, where their father had been deployed. The family soon relocated, first to England, and, in 1974, to Haverfordwest, Wales. The twin sisters were inseparable and their language, a sped-up Bajan Creole, made it difficult for people to understand them. In 2023, June said, &quot;We had a speech impediment. Our parents couldn&#x27;t understand a word that we were saying, nobody understood - so we stopped talking.&quot;

The Gibbons children were the only black children in the community, and were often ostracized at school. This proved to be traumatic for the twins, eventually causing their school administrators to dismiss them early each day so that they might avoid bullying. Their language became even more idiosyncratic at this time. Soon it was unintelligible to others. 

The girls&#x27; idioglossia has frequently been characterised as an example of cryptophasia, or a language devised and shared only by a set of twins, but June Gibbons has disputed this, stating that this was simply the effect of their speech impediment. According to June, the twins had in fact been speaking English, which others had mistaken for an invented language due to the severity of their speech difficulties. In 2023, she explained that even their own parents were unable to understand their speech, saying &#x27;we had to point at things we wanted, when our mother asked us what we wanted for tea or whatever. She thought we were talking a different language.&#x27; This difficulty continued when the twins started to attend school in Yorkshire. According to June: &#x27;they thought we were talking a different language. We could understand what we were saying, but I just don&#x27;t think they knew what we were saying at all.&#x27; Speech therapy was recommended for the twins, but this was ultimately unsuccessful due to their continued unwillingness to speak out loud for fear of being misunderstood, as well as the family&#x27;s frequent relocations due to their father&#x27;s military occupation. The twins became increasingly reserved, and eventually spoke to no one except each other and their younger sister Rose.

The girls continued to attend school, although they refused to read or write. In 1974, a medic administering vaccinations at the school noted their impassive behaviour and notified a child psychologist. The twins began seeing a succession of therapists who tried unsuccessfully to get them to communicate with others. They were sent to separate boarding schools in an attempt to break their isolation, but the pair became catatonic and entirely withdrawn when parted.

==Creative expression==
When they were reunited, the two spent several years isolating themselves in their bedroom, engaging in elaborate plays with dolls. They created many plays and stories in a sort of soap opera style, reading some of them aloud on tape as gifts for their sister Rose. Inspired by a pair of gift diaries on Christmas 1979, they began their writing careers. They sent away for a mail order course in creative writing, and each kept an extensive diary and wrote a number of stories, poems, and novels. Set primarily in the United States, and particularly in Malibu, California, the stories involve young men and women who exhibit strange and often criminal behaviour.

June wrote a novel titled &quot;The Pepsi-Cola Addict&quot;, in which the high-school hero is seduced by a teacher, then sent away to a reformatory where a homosexual guard makes a play for him. The two girls pooled their unemployment benefits in order to get the novel published by a vanity press. This was the only accessible work by either of the Gibbons sisters, which remained unavailable for purchase and held in only 89 libraries in the world until October 2022, when it was republished as a limited edition print by Cashen&#x27;s Gap. It was also published as a paperback in May 2023 by Strange Attractor. Their other attempts to publish novels and stories were generally unsuccessful, although Cashen&#x27;s Gap is planning future releases by June and Jennifer Gibbons. In Jennifer&#x27;s &quot;The Pugilist&quot;, a physician is so eager to save his child&#x27;s life that he kills the family dog to obtain its heart for a transplant. The dog&#x27;s spirit lives on in the child and ultimately has its revenge against the father. Jennifer also wrote &quot;Discomania&quot;, the story of a young woman who discovers that the atmosphere of a local disco incites patrons to insane violence. Jennifer&#x27;s &quot;Discomania&quot; is planned to be published posthumously in 2025 through Strange Attractor Press with a foreword by David Tibet of Current 93. She followed up with &quot;The Taxi-Driver&#x27;s Son&quot;, a radio play called &quot;Postman and Postwoman&quot;, and several short stories. June Gibbons is considered to be an outsider writer.

==Hospitalization==
In their later teenage years, the twins began using drugs and alcohol. In 1981, the girls committed crimes including vandalism, petty theft and arson, which led to them being admitted to Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security mental health hospital. The twins were sentenced to indefinite detention under the Mental Health Act 1983. They remained at Broadmoor for eleven years. June later blamed this lengthy sentence on their selective muteness: &quot;Juvenile delinquents get 1 million years in prison... We got twelve years of hell because we didn&#x27;t speak... We lost hope, really. I wrote a letter to the Queen, asking her to get us out. But we were trapped.&quot; Placed on high doses of antipsychotic medications, they found themselves unable to concentrate; Jennifer apparently developed tardive dyskinesia (a neurological disorder resulting in involuntary, repetitive movements). Their medications were apparently adjusted sufficiently to allow them to continue the copious diaries they had begun in 1980, and they were able to join the hospital choir, but they lost most of their interest in creative writing.

The case gained attention due to newspaper coverage by journalist Marjorie Wallace of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Wallace later wrote a book about the two titled &quot;The Silent Twins&quot;, published in 1986 by Prentice Hall.

==Jennifer&#x27;s death==
According to Wallace, the girls had a longstanding agreement that if one died, the other must begin to speak and live a normal life. During their stay in the hospital, they began to believe that it was necessary for one of them to die, and after much discussion, Jennifer agreed to make the sacrifice of her life. In March 1993, the twins were transferred from Broadmoor to the more open Caswell Clinic in Bridgend, Wales. On arrival, Jennifer could not be roused. She was taken to the hospital, where she died soon after of acute myocarditis, a sudden inflammation of the heart. There was no evidence of drugs or poison in her system.

At the inquest, June revealed that Jennifer had been acting strangely for about a day before their release; her speech had been slurring, and she had said that she was dying. On the trip to Caswell, she had slept in June&#x27;s lap with her eyes open. On a visit a few days later, Wallace recounted that June &quot;was in a strange mood&quot;. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m free at last, liberated, and at last Jennifer has given up her life for me.&quot; She also described it as a tsunami, washing her of her sins and being free of her sister. Jennifer was interred in St Martin&#x27;s Cemetery, Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales.

After Jennifer&#x27;s death, June gave interviews with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. By 2008, she was living quietly and independently, near her parents in West Wales. She is no longer monitored by psychiatric services, has been accepted by her community, and sought to put the past behind her. A 2016 interview with her sister Greta revealed that the family had been deeply troubled by the girls&#x27; incarceration. She blamed Broadmoor for ruining their lives and for neglecting Jennifer&#x27;s health. She had wanted to file a lawsuit against Broadmoor, but Aubrey and Gloria refused, saying it would not bring Jennifer back.

== In the media ==

The pair were the subject of the 1986 television drama &quot;The Silent Twins&quot;, broadcast on BBC2 as part of its &quot;Screen Two&quot; series, and an &quot;Inside Story&quot; documentary &quot;Silent Twin – Without My Shadow&quot;, which aired on BBC1 in September 1994. A play based on Wallace&#x27;s book, titled &quot;Speechless&quot;, debuted in London in 2011.

The American poet Lucie Brock-Broido wrote a poem, &quot;Elective Mutes&quot;, about the twins in her first book &quot;The Hunger&quot;, published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1988.

The twins&#x27; story also inspired the 1998 Manic Street Preachers song &quot;Tsunami&quot;.

Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Smoczyńska directed the 2022 feature film &quot;The Silent Twins&quot;, with the twins as the subject, starring Letitia Wright and Tamara Lawrance, based on the 1986 book &quot;The Silent Twins&quot; by Marjorie Wallace. Smoczyńska&#x27;s English-language debut, the film was an international co-production between the UK&#x27;s 42 Management &amp; Production and Poland&#x27;s Mandats and backed by the Polish Film Institute and moderator Inwestycje.

Angeline Morrison&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;The Sorrow Songs (Folk Songs of Black British Experience)&quot; features a song about the twins, &quot;The Flames They Do Grow High&quot;.

The story of the twins was the subject of a 2023 BBC podcast &quot;June: Voice of a Silent Twin&quot;, which featured an extensive interview with June Gibbons, recounting the twins&#x27; childhood, events leading to their trial and imprisonment and their eventual release.

<doc id="621798" wikidata="Q287933" url="?curid=621798" title="Jah Wobble">
<text>John Joseph Wardle (born 11 August 1958), known by the stage name Jah Wobble, is an English bass guitarist and singer. He became known to a wider audience as the original bass player in Public Image Ltd (PiL) in the late 1970s and early 1980s; he left the band after two albums.

Following his departure from PiL, he developed a solo career. In 2012, he reunited with fellow PiL guitarist Keith Levene for Metal Box in Dub and the album &quot;Yin &amp; Yang&quot;. Since 2013, he has been one of the featured pundits on Sunday morning&#x27;s &quot;The Virtual Jukebox&quot; segment of BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s &quot;Up All Night&quot; with Dotun Adebayo. His autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of a Geezer&quot;, was published in 2009.

==Early life==
Wardle was born in Stepney, East London, his father, Harry Eugene Wardle, worked as a postman, while his mother, Kathleen Bridget (née Fitzgibbon), was a school and County Hall secretary. Wobble grew up with his family in Whitechapel&#x27;s Clichy Estate in London&#x27;s East End. He is a long-time friend of John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), whom he had met in the 1970s at London&#x27;s Kingsway College. The two formed half of the group of friends known as &quot;The Four Johns&quot;, along with John Grey and John Simon Ritchie (later known as Sid Vicious). Jah Wobble acquired his stage name through the drunken, mumbled version of Wardle&#x27;s name by Sid Vicious, which Wobble kept because &quot;people would never forget it&quot;.

== Musical career ==
In his early life and career, by his own admission, Wardle was given to occasional bouts of aggression, exacerbated by heavy drinking and drug use. As a result, he ended up living in a squat with John Gray in West London, while Lydon formed The Sex Pistols. With admittedly large &quot;builders hands&quot;, he had experimented with the guitar, but found playing bass a more connected and whole body experience, influenced in part by admiring Bob Marley&#x27;s and The Wailers bassist Aston &quot;Family Man&quot; Barrett on stage in 1975. Wardle was as critical of his friend Vicious&#x27;s bass playing as John Lydon, and had hence played in experimentation sessions with Lydon. After he burned the furniture of his squat-mates in order to stay warm, they left him alone there with a mattress, a headboard and his Music Man-copy bass.

=== Public Image Ltd (PiL) ===
Following the Sex Pistols&#x27; break-up, Lydon approached Wobble about forming a band. Both had similarly broad musical tastes, and were avid fans of reggae and world music. The band began rehearsing together in May 1978, although remained unnamed until July 1978, when Lydon officially named the band Public Image (PiL) (the &quot;Ltd&quot; was not added until several months later), after the Muriel Spark novel &quot;The Public Image&quot;. Wobble&#x27;s bass playing drew heavily on dub, which has remained an important feature of his music. Having experimented with Lydon pre-Sex Pistols break-up, he had written a simple repetitive bassline on which Lydon wrote &quot;Public Image&quot;. PiL debuted in October 1978 with &quot;Public Image&quot;, which reached number 9 on the UK charts, and also performed well on import in the US. Wobble has stated that the first PiL album was recorded so quickly due in part to the bassist&#x27;s altercations with a sound engineer and men at a nearby pub. He has, however, dismissed claims accusing him of extreme malice, such as setting fire to the former drummer for The Fall, Karl Burns, while Burns was session drumming for PiL.

Wobble co-wrote and contributed bass and drums to PiL&#x27;s second album &quot;Metal Box&quot;, which was released in 1979. However, he grew increasingly frustrated by the lacklustre creative atmosphere in the band, which he felt stifled his artistic ambitions and PiL&#x27;s creative potential. Besides differences in artistic vision, further conflicts were brought on in part by heavy drug and alcohol abuse in the band. Wobble then recorded his debut album &quot;The Legend Lives On... Jah Wobble in &quot;Betrayal&quot;&quot;, making unauthorised use of material from &quot;Metal Box&quot; for which he was summarily fired from PiL in late 1980.

Wobble also released at least one single during his period as a member of PiL: His 1978 single &quot;Dreadlock Don&#x27;t Deal in Wedlock&quot; in which he recites Edward Lear&#x27;s &quot;The Owl and the Pussycat&quot; and finishes with the line, &#x27;love and marriage is like ice cream and cabbage ... dreadlock don&#x27;t deal in wedlock.&quot;

===Early post-PiL years===
Soon after leaving PiL, Wobble formed The Human Condition with guitarist Dave &quot;Animal&quot; Maltby and PiL&#x27;s original drummer, Jim Walker. The Human Condition toured the UK, Europe, and US in 1981, and made two cassette-only releases of their live shows (&quot;Live at the Collegiate Theatre&quot; and &quot;Live in Europe&quot;). The post-PiL years saw Wobble also collaborating with Can members Holger Czukay and Jaki Liebezeit on Czukay&#x27;s solo projects (notably &quot;On the Way to the Peak of Normal&quot; and &quot;Rome Remains Rome&quot;) and &quot;Full Circle&quot; (released in 1984).

In 1983, Wardle appeared on the LP &quot;Snake Charmer&quot; billed as a co-leader alongside guitarist The Edge of U2, Czukay, Liebezeit, and producer François Kevorkian.

Jah Wobble&#x27;s Invaders of the Heart was formed in 1982. The original line-up was Ollie Marland on keys (who went on to become Tina Turner&#x27;s musical director), Annie Whitehead on trombone, Neville Murray on percussion and a musician named only as Cliff, on drums. By 1983 Lee Partis was the drummer. Trumpeter Harry Beckett and pedal steel player B. J. Cole regularly performed with the group.

By 1985 Jah Wobble&#x27;s heavy drinking and drunken brawls were having an effect on his life. Halfway through the recording of the album &quot;Psalms&quot; (October 1986), Wobble stopped drinking. From then through to the present day he has remained &#x27;clean and sober&#x27;.

He then did a variety of day jobs, whilst continuing to perform and record his music in what spare time he had. These jobs included a long stretch with the London Underground. In an oft-quoted tale, it is related that he once, at Tower Hill Underground Station via the public address system, regaled commuters with the deadpan announcement, &quot;I used to be somebody. I repeat, I used to be somebody.&quot;

By 1987, due to the repeated prompting of his friend and former bandmate, percussionist Neville Murray, Wobble reformed The Invaders of the Heart. Armed with a live recording of a concert he had made with a new line-up of musicians during a European tour in 1988, Wobble travelled to New York City&#x27;s New Music Seminar in 1989 to get back into the music industry. Wobble was able to secure an eleventh-hour record deal with a small European record label. The live album, &quot;Without Judgement&quot;, was recorded in the Netherlands and was released in November 1989. 

Following the relative success of Without Judgement, Wobble has collaborated with many musicians - Brian Eno among them - &amp; his explorations into world music predated much of the genre&#x27;s popularity. Wobble hit his commercial peak with 1991&#x27;s &quot;Rising Above Bedlam&quot;. While the album did not chart, it spawned four singles including his first top-40 hit, Visions of You, featuring Sinéad O&#x27;Connor. Jah Wobble&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Take Me to God&quot; was influenced by world music genres and contributions from a variety of artists of diverse cultural backgrounds, including Baaba Maal, Dolores O&#x27;Riordan, and Chaka Demus, and was also a critical and commercial success.

===Mid 1990s to present===
Although he has released recordings since the late seventies, Wobble has been particularly prolific from the mid-1990s to the present. He now runs his own label, 30 Hertz Records, and tours regularly throughout the UK and Europe with his current band, Jah Wobble &amp; The Invaders of the Heart.
His music has spanned a number of genres, including ambient music and dance music, and in 2003, reworkings of traditional English folk songs. 

Wobble was part of the industrial music supergroup The Damage Manual, which formed in 2000 and consisted of Wobble on bass alongside former PiL and Killing Joke drummer Martin Atkins, Killing Joke guitarist Geordie Walker, and vocalist Chris Connelly (who had previously worked with Atkins as part of two other industrial music supergroups, Pigface and Murder Inc., the latter of which also featured Walker). He appeared on the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album as well as the EP &quot;One&quot;, both of which were released on Atkins&#x27; Invisible Records label, but subsequently left the group after declining to participate in their tour of the U.S.

A collaboration with his wife, the Chinese-born guzheng player Zi Lan Liao, was entitled &quot;Chinese Dub&quot;. He also performed at the 2008 Rhythm Festival.

Jah Wobble and the Chinese Dub Orchestra won the Cross-Cultural Collaboration category, for their album &quot;Chinese Dub&quot;, in the inaugural Songlines Music Awards, announced on 1 May 2009, which were the new world music awards organised by the UK based magazine, &quot;Songlines&quot;.

In September 2009, John Lydon reformed PiL for a series of concerts in late 2009. Despite Lydon&#x27;s invitation to join, Jah Wobble did not feature in the line-up, since he considered the wages offered insufficient and disagreed with the choice of venues.

At an impromptu appearance at the Musicport Festival in Bridlington Spa on 24 October 2010, where they were joined by vocalist Johnny Rotter of the Sex Pistols Experience, Wobble renewed his association with former PiL guitarist Keith Levene.

In 2011, Wobble collaborated with Julie Campbell, alias Warp Records artist LoneLady in a project called &quot;Psychic Life&quot;. The debut album, &quot;Psychic Life&quot;, was inspired by disco, post-punk and psychogeography, and released by Cherry Red Records on 14 November 2011. Keith Levene contributed to three tracks on the album. A digital-only EP, &quot;Psychic Life&quot;, fronted by the song &quot;Tightrope&quot;, was released in October 2011.

In early 2012, after some planned Japan gigs were cancelled because of visa issues, Wobble and Levene played various UK clubs as &quot;Metal Box in Dub&quot;. The visa issues were resolved and they played Fuji Rock festival in July 2012. This was followed by the release of a four-song, eponymous EP. An album entitled &quot;Yin &amp; Yang&quot; was released in November 2012.

Wobble has also collaborated with the British ambient group Marconi Union, the results of which were released as an album called Anomic on 30 Hertz records in June 2013. In October 2013, 30 Hertz Records released &quot;Odds &amp; Sods &amp; Epilogues&quot;, an illustrated book/CD of Jah Wobble&#x27;s poetry.

In 2015, Cherry Red Records released Redux, a six-CD box set that spans nearly four decades of Wobble&#x27;s music. It includes new tracks &quot;Merry Go Round&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Psycho&quot;. In May 2015, Jah Wobble &amp; The Invaders of the Heart embarked on an extensive six-month UK tour. They recorded the album &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; which was released on 3m Music in 2017. A series of gigs in England from January to May 2017 was announced.

==Other activities==
Jah Wobble studied part-time for four years at Birkbeck, University of London, graduating in 2000 with an upper second-class honours degree in the humanities.

His autobiography, entitled &quot;Memoirs of a Geezer: Music, Life, Mayhem&quot; (Serpent&#x27;s Tail books, London), was released in September 2009. It was well received by critics. He also writes occasional book reviews for &quot;The Independent&quot;.

==Personal life==
Wobble has four children, including music producer Natalie Wardle from his first marriage, and two sons with his second wife, the Chinese-born guzheng player and harpist Zi Lan Liao. Wobble was brought up a Roman Catholic but later converted to Buddhism.

<text>Kurt Heegner (; 16 December 1893 – 2 February 1965) was a German private scholar from Berlin, who specialized in 
radio engineering and mathematics. He is famous for his mathematical discoveries in number theory and, in particular, the Stark–Heegner theorem.

==Life and career==
Heegner was born and died in Berlin. In 1952, he published the Stark–Heegner theorem which he claimed was the solution to a classic number theory problem proposed by the great mathematician Gauss, the class number 1 problem. Heegner&#x27;s work was not accepted for years, mainly due to his quoting of a portion of Heinrich Martin Weber&#x27;s work that was known to be incorrect (though he never used this result in the proof).

Heegner&#x27;s proof was accepted as essentially correct after a 1967 announcement by Bryan Birch, and definitively resolved by a paper by Harold Stark that had been delayed in publication until 1969 (Stark had independently arrived at a similar proof, but disagrees with the common notion that his proof is &quot;more or less the same&quot; as Heegner&#x27;s). Stark attributed Heegner&#x27;s mistakes to the fact he used a textbook by Weber that contained some results with incomplete proofs.

The book &quot;The Legacy of Leonhard Euler: A Tricentennial Tribute&quot; by Lokenath Debnath claims on page 64, that Heegner was a &quot;retired Swiss mathematician&quot;, but he appears to have been neither Swiss nor retired at the time of his 1952 paper.

<doc id="621809" wikidata="Q466797" url="?curid=621809" title="Asana">
<text>An āsana (Sanskrit: ) is a body posture, originally and still a general term for a sitting meditation pose, and later extended in hatha yoga and modern yoga as exercise, to any type of position, adding reclining, standing, inverted, twisting, and balancing poses. The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; define &quot;asana&quot; as &quot;[a position that] is steady and comfortable&quot;. Patanjali mentions the ability to sit for extended periods as one of the eight limbs of his system. Asanas are also called yoga poses or yoga postures in English.

The 10th or 11th century &quot;Goraksha Sataka&quot; and the 15th century &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; identify 84 asanas; the 17th century &quot;Hatha Ratnavali&quot; provides a different list of 84 asanas, describing some of them. In the 20th century, Indian nationalism favoured physical culture in response to colonialism. In that environment, pioneers such as Yogendra, Kuvalayananda, and Krishnamacharya taught a new system of asanas (incorporating systems of exercise as well as traditional hatha yoga). Among Krishnamacharya&#x27;s pupils were influential Indian yoga teachers including Pattabhi Jois, founder of Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga, and B.K.S. Iyengar, founder of Iyengar yoga. Together they described hundreds more asanas, revived the popularity of yoga, and brought it to the Western world. Many more asanas have been devised since Iyengar&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Light on Yoga&quot; which described some 200 asanas. Hundreds more were illustrated by Dharma Mittra.

Asanas were claimed to provide both spiritual and physical benefits in medieval hatha yoga texts. More recently, studies have provided evidence that they improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to reduce stress and conditions related to it; and specifically to alleviate some diseases such as asthma and diabetes.

Asanas have appeared in culture for many centuries. Religious Indian art depicts figures of the Buddha, Jain tirthankaras, and Shiva in lotus position and other meditation seats, and in the &quot;royal ease&quot; position, lalitasana. With the popularity of yoga as exercise, asanas feature commonly in novels and films, and sometimes also in advertising.

== History ==

=== Ancient times ===
The central figure in the Pashupati seal from the Indus Valley civilization of was identified by Sir John Marshall in 1931 as a prototype of the god Shiva, recognised by being three-faced; in a yoga position as the Mahayogin, the god of yoga; having four animals as Pashupati, the Lord of Beasts; with deer beneath the throne, as in medieval depictions of Shiva; having a three-part headdress recalling Shiva&#x27;s trident; and possibly being ithyphallic, again like Shiva. If correct, this would be the oldest record of an asana. However, with no proof anywhere of an Indus Valley origin for Shiva, with multiple competing interpretations of the Pashupati seal and no obvious way of deciding between these, there is no reliable evidence that it is actually a yoga pose that is depicted in the seal.

Asanas originated in India. In his &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, Patanjali (c. 2nd to 4th century CE) describes asana practice as the third of the eight limbs (Sanskrit: अष्टाङ्ग, &quot;aṣṭāṅga&quot;, from अष्ट् &quot;aṣṭ&quot;, eight, and अङ्ग &quot;aṅga&quot;, limb) of classical, or raja yoga. 
The word asana, in use in English since the 19th century, is from &quot;āsana&quot; &quot;sitting down&quot; (from आस् &quot;ās&quot; &quot;to sit down&quot;), a sitting posture, a meditation seat.

The eight limbs are, in order, the yamas (codes of social conduct), niyamas (self-observances), asanas (postures), pranayama (breath work), pratyahara (sense withdrawal or non-attachment), dharana (concentration), dhyana (meditation), and samadhi (realization of the true Self or Atman, and unity with Brahman, ultimate reality).
Asanas, along with the breathing exercises of pranayama, are the physical movements of hatha yoga and of modern yoga. Patanjali describes asanas as a &quot;steady and comfortable posture&quot;, referring to the seated postures used for pranayama and for meditation, where meditation is the path to samadhi, transpersonal self-realization.

The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; do not mention a single asana by name, merely specifying the characteristics of a good asana:

The &quot;Sutras&quot; are embedded in the &quot;Bhasya&quot; commentary, which scholars suggest may also be by Patanjali; it names 12 seated meditation asanas including Padmasana, Virasana, Bhadrasana, and Svastikasana.

=== Medieval texts===

The 10th–11th century &quot;Vimanarcanakalpa&quot; is the first manuscript to describe a non-seated asana, in the form of Mayurasana (peacock) – a balancing pose. Such poses appear, according to the scholar James Mallinson, to have been created outside Shaivism, the home of the Nath yoga tradition, and to have been associated with asceticism; they were later adopted by the Nath yogins.

The &quot;Goraksha Sataka&quot; (10–11th century), or &quot;Goraksha Paddhathi&quot;, an early hatha yogic text, describes the origin of the 84 classic asanas said to have been revealed by the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. Observing that there are as many postures as there are beings and asserting that there are 84 lakh or 8,400,000 species in all, the text states that Lord Shiva fashioned an asana for each lakh, thus giving 84 in all, although it mentions and describes only two in detail: Siddhasana and Padmasana. The number 84 is symbolic rather than literal, indicating completeness and sacredness.

The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; (15th century) specifies that of these 84, the first four are important, namely the seated poses Siddhasana, Padmasana, Bhadrasana and Simhasana.

The pillars of the 16th century Achyutaraya temple at Hampi are decorated with numerous relief statues of yogins in asanas including Siddhasana balanced on a stick, Chakrasana, Yogapattasana which requires the use of a strap, and a hand-standing inverted pose with a stick, as well as several unidentified poses.

By the 17th century, asanas became an important component of Hatha yoga practice, and more non-seated poses appear. The &quot;Hatha Ratnavali&quot; by Srinivasa (17th century) is one of the few texts to attempt an actual listing of 84 asanas,
although 4 out of its list cannot be translated from the Sanskrit, and at least 11 are merely mentioned without any description, their appearance known from other texts.

The &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; (late 17th century) again asserts that Shiva taught 84 lakh of asanas, out of which 84 are preeminent, and &quot;32 are useful in the world of mortals.&quot; The yoga teacher and scholar Mark Singleton notes from study of the primary texts that &quot;asana was rarely, if ever, the primary feature of the significant yoga traditions in India.&quot; The scholar Norman Sjoman comments that a continuous tradition running all the way back to the medieval yoga texts cannot be traced, either in the practice of asanas or in a history of scholarship.

=== Modern pioneers ===

From the 1850s onwards, a culture of physical exercise developed in India to counter the colonial stereotype of supposed &quot;degeneracy&quot; of Indians compared to the British, a belief reinforced by then-current ideas of Lamarckism and eugenics. This culture was taken up from the 1880s to the early 20th century by Indian nationalists such as Tiruka, who taught exercises and unarmed combat techniques under the guise of yoga. Meanwhile, proponents of Indian physical culture like K. V. Iyer consciously combined &quot;hata yoga&quot; with bodybuilding in his Bangalore gymnasium.

Singleton notes that poses close to Parighasana, Parsvottanasana, Navasana and others were described in Niels Bukh&#x27;s 1924 Danish text &quot;Grundgymnastik eller primitiv gymnastik&quot; (known in English as &quot;Primary Gymnastics&quot;). These in turn were derived from a 19th-century Scandinavian tradition of gymnastics dating back to Pehr Ling, and &quot;found their way to India&quot; by the early 20th century.

Yoga asanas were brought to America in 1919 by Yogendra, sometimes called &quot;the Father of the Modern Yoga Renaissance&quot;, his system influenced by the physical culture of Max Müller.

In 1924, Swami Kuvalayananda founded the Kaivalyadhama Health and Yoga Research Center in Maharashtra. He combined asanas with Indian systems of exercise and modern European gymnastics, having according to the scholar Joseph Alter a &quot;profound&quot; effect on the evolution of yoga.

In 1925, Paramahansa Yogananda, having moved from India to America, set up the Self-Realization Fellowship in Los Angeles, and taught yoga, including asanas, breathing, chanting and meditation, to tens of thousands of Americans, as described in his 1946 &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;.

Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (1888–1989) studied under Kuvalayananda in the 1930s, creating &quot;a marriage of hatha yoga, wrestling exercises, and modern Western gymnastic movement, and unlike anything seen before in the yoga tradition.&quot; Sjoman argues that Krishnamacharya drew on the &quot;Vyayama Dipika&quot; gymnastic exercise manual to create the Mysore Palace system of yoga. Singleton argues that Krishnamacharya was familiar with the gymnastics culture of his time, which was influenced by Scandinavian gymnastics; his experimentation with asanas and innovative use of gymnastic jumping between poses may well explain, Singleton suggests, the resemblances between modern standing asanas and Scandinavian gymnastics. Krishnamacharya, known as the father of modern yoga, had among his pupils people who became influential yoga teachers themselves: the Russian Eugenie V. Peterson, known as Indra Devi; Pattabhi Jois, who founded Ashtanga (vinyasa) yoga in 1948; B.K.S. Iyengar, his brother-in-law, who founded Iyengar Yoga; T.K.V. Desikachar, his son, who continued his Viniyoga tradition; Srivatsa Ramaswami; and A. G. Mohan, co-founder of Svastha Yoga &amp; Ayurveda. Together they revived the popularity of yoga and brought it to the Western world.

In 1960, Vishnudevananda Saraswati, in the Sivananda yoga school, published a compilation of sixty-six basic postures and 136 variations of those postures in &quot;The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga&quot;.

In 1966, Iyengar published &quot;Light on Yoga: Yoga Dipika&quot;, illustrated with some 600 photographs of Iyengar demonstrating around 200 asanas; it systematised the physical practice of asanas. It became a bestseller, selling three million copies, and was translated into some 17 languages.

In 1984, Dharma Mittra compiled a list of about 1,300 asanas and their variations, derived from ancient and modern sources, illustrating them with photographs of himself in each posture; the Dharma Yoga website suggests that he created some 300 of these.

=== Origins of the asanas ===
The asanas have been created at different times, a few being ancient, some being medieval, and a growing number recent. Some that appear traditional, such as Virabhadrasana I (Warrior Pose I), are relatively recent: that pose was probably devised by Krishnamacharya around 1940, and it was popularised by his pupil, Iyengar. A pose that is certainly younger than that is Parivritta Parsvakonasana (Revolved Side Angle Pose): it was not in the first edition of Pattabhi Jois&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Mala&quot; in 1962. Viparita Virabhadrasana (Reversed Warrior Pose) is still more recent, and may have been created after 2000. Several poses that are now commonly practised, such as Dog Pose and standing asanas including Trikonasana (triangle pose), first appeared in the 20th century, as did the sequence of asanas, Surya Namaskar (Salute to the Sun). A different sun salutation, the Aditya Hridayam, is certainly ancient, as it is described in the &quot;Yuddha Kaanda&quot; Canto 107 of the &quot;Ramayana&quot;. Surya Namaskar in its modern form was created by the Raja of Aundh, Bhawanrao Shriniwasrao Pant Pratinidhi; K. Pattabhi Jois defined the variant forms Surya Namaskar A and B for Ashtanga Yoga, possibly derived from Krishnamacharya. Surya Namaskar can be seen as &quot;a modern, physical culture-oriented rendition&quot; of the simple ancient practice of prostrating oneself to the sun.

In 1966, Iyengar&#x27;s classic &quot;Light on Yoga&quot; was able to describe some 200 asanas, consisting of about 50 main poses with their variations. Sjoman observes that whereas many traditional asanas are named for objects (like Vrikshasana, tree pose), legendary figures (like Matsyendrasana, the sage Matsyendra&#x27;s pose), or animals (like Kurmasana, tortoise pose), &quot;an overwhelming eighty-three&quot; of Iyengar&#x27;s asanas have names that simply describe the body&#x27;s position (like Utthita Parsvakonasana, &quot;Extended Side Angle Pose&quot;); these are, he suggests, the ones &quot;that have been developed later&quot;. A name following this pattern is Shatkonasana, &quot;Six Triangles Pose&quot;, described in 2015. Mittra illustrated 908 poses and variations in his 1984 &quot;Master Yoga Chart&quot;, and many more have been created since then. The number of asanas has thus grown increasingly rapidly with time, as summarised in the table.

Sjoman notes that the names of asanas have been used &quot;promiscuous[ly]&quot;, in a tradition of &quot;amalgamation and borrowing&quot; over the centuries, making their history difficult to trace. The presence of matching names is not proof of continuity, since the same name may mean a different pose, and a pose may have been known by multiple names at different times. The estimates here are therefore based on actual descriptions of the asanas.

The graph shows the rapid growth in number of asanas in the 20th century.

== Purposes ==

=== Spiritual ===

The asanas of hatha yoga originally had a spiritual purpose within Hinduism, the attainment of samadhi, a state of meditative consciousness. The scholar of religion Andrea Jain notes that medieval Hatha Yoga was shared among yoga traditions, from Shaivite Naths to Vaishnavas, Jains and Sufis; in her view, its aims too varied, including spiritual goals involving the &quot;tantric manipulation of the subtle body&quot;, and at a more physical level, destroying poisons. Singleton describes Hatha Yoga&#x27;s purpose as &quot;the transmutation of the human body into a vessel immune from mortal decay&quot;, citing the &quot;Gheranda Samhita&quot; metaphor of an earthenware pot that requires the fire of yoga to make it serviceable. Mallinson and Singleton note that the purposes of asana practice were, until around the fourteenth century, firstly to form a stable platform for pranayama, mantra repetition (japa), and meditation, practices that in turn had spiritual goals; and secondly to stop the accumulation of karma and instead acquire ascetic power, tapas, something that conferred &quot;supernatural abilities&quot;. Hatha Yoga added the ability to cure diseases to this list. Not all Hindu scriptures agreed that asanas were beneficial. The 10th century &quot;Garuda Purana&quot; stated that &quot;the techniques of posture do not promote yoga. Though called essentials, they all retard one&#x27;s progress,&quot; while early yogis often practised extreme austerities (tapas) to overcome what they saw as the obstacle of the body in the way of liberation.

The yoga scholar and practitioner Theos Bernard, in his 1944 &quot;Hatha Yoga: The Report of a Personal Experience&quot;, stated that he was &quot;prescribed ... a group of asanas calculated to bring a rich supply of blood to the brain and to various parts of the spinal cord .. [and] a series of reconditioning asanas to stretch, bend, and twist the spinal cord&quot; followed when he was strong enough by the meditation asanas. Bernard named the purpose of Hatha Yoga as &quot;to gain control of the breath&quot; to enable pranayama to work, something that in his view required thorough use of the six purifications.

Asanas work in different ways from conventional physical exercises, according to Satyananda Saraswati &quot;placing the physical body in positions that cultivate awareness, relaxation and concentration&quot;. Leslie Kaminoff writes in &quot;Yoga Anatomy&quot; that from one point of view, &quot;all of asana practice can be viewed as a methodical way of freeing up the spine, limbs, and breathing so that the yogi can spend extended periods of time in a seated position.&quot;

Iyengar observed that the practice of asanas &quot;brings steadiness, health, and lightness of limb. A steady and pleasant posture produces mental equilibrium and prevents fickleness of mind.&quot; He adds that they bring agility, balance, endurance, and &quot;great vitality&quot;, developing the body to a &quot;fine physique which is strong and elastic without being muscle-bound&quot;. But, Iyengar states, their real importance is the way they train the mind, &quot;conquer[ing]&quot; the body and making it &quot;a fit vehicle for the spirit&quot;.

Iyengar saw it as significant that asanas are named after plants, insects, fish and amphibians, reptiles, birds, and quadrupeds; as well as &quot;legendary heroes&quot;, sages, and avatars of Hindu gods, in his view &quot;illustrating spiritual evolution&quot;. For instance, the lion pose, Simhasana, recalls the myth of Narasimha, half man, half lion, and an avatar of Vishnu, as told in the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;. The message is, Iyengar explains, that while performing asanas, the yogi takes the form of different creatures, from the lowest to the highest, not despising any &quot;for he knows that throughout the whole gamut of creation ... there breathes the same Universal Spirit.&quot; Through mastery of the asanas, Iyengar states, dualities like gain and loss, or fame and shame disappear.

Sjoman argues that the concept of stretching in yoga can be looked at through one of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, 2.47, which says that [asanas are achieved] by loosening (&quot;śaithilya&quot;) the effort (&quot;prayatna&quot;) and meditating on the endless (&quot;ananta&quot;). Sjoman points out that this physical loosening is to do with the mind&#x27;s letting go of restrictions, allowing the natural state of &quot;unhindered perfect balance&quot; to emerge; he notes that one can only relax through effort, &quot;as only a muscle that is worked is able to relax (that is, there is a distinction between dormancy and relaxation).&quot; Thus asanas had a spiritual purpose, serving to explore the conscious and unconscious mind.

Heinz Grill considers the soul in our human existence to be a central link between the manifest body and the unmanifest spirit. Therefore it should not be the sense-attached, bodily-involved consciousness that motivates yoga practice, but spiritual thoughts. According to Grill, this path from above to below is essential, because “the soul lives in the receptivity of giving and not in the receptivity of earthly taking.” For the practice he has written a book called &quot;The Souldimension of Yoga&quot;, which has already been translated into many languages.

=== Exercise ===
Since the mid-20th century, asanas have been used, especially in the Western world, as physical exercise. In this context, their &quot;overtly Hindu&quot; purpose is masked but its &quot;ecstatic ... transcendent ... possibly subversive&quot; elements remain. That context has led to a division of opinion among Christians, some asserting that it is acceptable as long as they are aware of yoga&#x27;s origins, others stating that hatha yoga&#x27;s purpose is inherently Hindu, making Christian yoga an evident contradiction or indeed &quot;diametrically opposed to Christianity&quot;. A similar debate has taken place in a Muslim context; under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, yoga, formerly banned as a Hindu practice, has been legalised, while mainly-Hindu Bali has held a yoga competition in defiance of a ruling by Indonesia&#x27;s Muslim Ulema Council.

In a secular context, the journalists Nell Frizzell and Reni Eddo-Lodge have debated (in &quot;The Guardian&quot;) whether Western yoga classes represent &quot;cultural appropriation&quot;. In Frizzell&#x27;s view, yoga has become a new entity, a long way from the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; of Patanjali, and while some practitioners are culturally insensitive, others treat it with more respect. Eddo-Lodge agrees that Western yoga is far from Patanjali, but argues that the changes cannot be undone, whether people use it &quot;as a holier-than-thou tool, as a tactic to balance out excessive drug use, or practised similarly to its origins with the spirituality that comes with it&quot;.

From a Hindu perspective, the practice of asanas in the Western world as physical exercise is sometimes seen as yoga that has lost its way. In 2012, the Hindu American Foundation ran a &quot;Take Back Yoga&quot; campaign to emphasise yoga&#x27;s roots in Hinduism.

===For women===

In the West, yoga is practiced mainly by women. For example, in Britain in the 1970s, women formed between 70 and 90 percent of most yoga classes, as well as most of the yoga teachers. It has been suggested that yoga was seen as a support for women in the face of male-dominated medicine, offering an alternative approach for chronic medical conditions, as well as to beauty and ageing, and it offered a way of meeting other women. Singleton notes that women in yoga are in the tradition of Mollie Bagot Stack&#x27;s 1930 League of Health and Beauty, influenced by Stack&#x27;s visit to India in 1912 when she learnt some asanas, and in turn of Genevieve Stebbins&#x27;s Harmonic Gymnastics.

== Effects ==

Asanas have, or are claimed to have, multiple effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful. These include the conscious usage of groups of muscles, effects on health, and possible injury especially in the presence of known contraindications.

=== Muscle usage ===

A 2014 study indicated that different asanas activated particular groups of muscles, varying with the skill of the practitioners, from beginner to instructor. The eleven asanas in the Surya Namaskar sequences A and B (of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga) were performed by beginners, advanced practitioners and instructors. The activation of 14 groups of muscles was measured with electrodes on the skin over the muscles. Among the findings, beginners used pectoral muscles more than instructors, whereas instructors used deltoid muscles more than other practitioners, as well as the vastus medialis (which stabilises the knee). The yoga instructor Grace Bullock writes that such patterns of activation suggest that asana practice increases awareness of the body and the patterns in which muscles are engaged, making exercise more beneficial and safer.

=== Claimed benefits ===
Medieval hatha yoga texts make a variety of claims for the benefits brought by the asanas, both spiritual and physical. The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; (HYP) states that asanas in general, described as the first auxiliary of hatha yoga, give &quot;steadiness, good health, and lightness of limb.&quot; (HYP 1.17) Specific asanas, it claims, bring additional benefits; for example, Matsyendrasana awakens Kundalini and makes the semen steady; (HYP 1.27) Paschimottanasana &quot;stokes up the digestive fire, slims the belly and gives good health&quot;; (HYP 1.29) Shavasana &quot;takes away fatigue and relaxes the mind&quot;; (HYP 1.32) Siddhasana &quot;bursts open the door to liberation&quot;; (HYP 1.35) while Padmasana &quot;destroys all diseases&quot; (HYP 1.47) and if done together with retention of the breath in pranayama confers liberation. (HYP 1.44–49) These claims lie within a tradition across all forms of yoga that practitioners can gain supernatural powers, but with ambivalence about their usefulness, since they may obstruct progress towards liberation. Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Yogashastra&quot; (1.8–9) lists the magical powers, which include healing, the destruction of poisons, the ability to become as small as an atom or to go wherever one wishes, invisibility, and shape-shifting.

The asanas have been popularised in the Western world by claims about their health benefits, attained not by medieval hatha yoga magic but by the physical and psychological effects of exercise and stretching on the body. The history of such claims was reviewed by William J. Broad in his 2012 book &quot;The Science of Yoga&quot;. Broad argues that while the health claims for yoga began as Hindu nationalist posturing, it turns out that there is ironically &quot;a wealth of real benefits&quot;.

Physically, the practice of asanas has been claimed to improve flexibility, strength, and balance; to alleviate stress and anxiety, and to reduce the symptoms of lower back pain. Claims have been made about beneficial effects on specific conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. There is evidence that practice of asanas improves birth outcomes and physical health and quality of life measures in the elderly, and reduces sleep disturbances and hypertension. Iyengar yoga is effective at least in the short term for both neck pain and low back pain.

=== Contra-indications ===

The National Institutes of Health notes that yoga is generally safe &quot;when performed properly&quot;, though people with some health conditions, older people, and pregnant woman may need to seek advice. For example, people with glaucoma are advised not to practise inverted postures. The &quot;Yoga Journal&quot; provides separate lists of asanas that it states are &quot;inadvisable&quot; and should be avoided or modified for each of the following medical conditions: asthma; back injury; carpal tunnel syndrome; diarrhoea; headache; heart problems; high blood pressure; insomnia; knee injury; low blood pressure; menstruation; neck injury; pregnancy; and shoulder injury.

The practice of asanas has sometimes been advised against during pregnancy, but that advice has been contested by a 2015 study which found no ill-effects from any of 26 asanas investigated. The study examined the effects of the set of asanas on 25 healthy women who were between 35 and 37 weeks pregnant. The authors noted that apart from their experimental findings, they had been unable to find any scientific evidence that supported the previously published concerns, and that on the contrary there was evidence including from systematic review that yoga was suitable for pregnant women, with a variety of possible benefits.

== Common practices ==
In the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, the only rule Patanjali suggests for practicing asana is that it be &quot;steady and comfortable&quot;. The body is held poised with the practitioner experiencing no discomfort. When control of the body is mastered, practitioners are believed to free themselves from dualities such as heat and cold, hunger and satiety, or joy and grief. This is the first step toward relieving suffering by letting go of attachment.

=== Traditional and modern guidance ===

Different schools of yoga, such as Iyengar and The Yoga Institute, agree that asanas are best practised with a rested body on an empty stomach, after having a bath. From the point of view of sports medicine, asanas function as active stretches, helping to protect muscles from injury; these need to be performed equally on both sides, the stronger side first if used for physical rehabilitation.

=== Surya Namaskar ===

Surya Namaskar, the Salute to the Sun, commonly practiced in most forms of modern yoga, links up to twelve asanas in a dynamically expressed yoga series. A full round consists of two sets of the series, the second set moving the opposing leg first. The asanas include Adho Mukha Svanasana (downward dog), the others differing from tradition to tradition with for instance a choice of Urdhva Mukha Svanasana (upward dog) or Bhujangasana (cobra) for one pose in the sequence. Schools, too, differ in their approaches to the sequence; for example, in Iyengar Yoga, variations such as inserting Maricyasana I and Pascimottanasana are suggested.

== Styles ==

In the Western world, asanas are taught in differing styles by the various schools of yoga. Some poses like Trikonasana are common to many of them, but not always performed in the same way. Some independently documented approaches are described below.

Iyengar Yoga &quot;emphasises precision and alignment&quot;, and prioritises correct movement over quantity, i.e. moving a little in the right direction is preferred to moving more but in a wrong direction. Postures are held for a relatively long period compared to other schools of yoga; this allows the muscles to relax and lengthen, and encourages awareness in the pose. Props including belts, blocks and blankets are freely used to assist students in correct working in the asanas. Beginners are introduced early on to standing poses, executed with careful attention to detail. For example, in Trikonasana, the feet are often jumped apart to a wide stance, the forward foot is turned out, and the centre of the forward heel is exactly aligned with the centre of the arch of the other foot.

Sivananda Yoga practices the asanas, hatha yoga, as part of raja yoga, with the goal of enabling practitioners &quot;&quot;to sit in meditation for a long time&quot;. There is little emphasis on the detail of individual poses; teachers rely on the basic instructions given in the books by Sivananda and Swami Vishnu-devananda. In Trikonasana, the top arm may be stretched forward parallel to the floor rather than straight up.
Sivananda Yoga identifies a group of 12 asanas as basic. These are not necessarily the easiest poses, nor those that every class would include. Trikonasana is the last of the 12, whereas in other schools it is one of the first and used to loosen the hips in preparation for other poses.

In Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, poses are executed differently from Iyengar Yoga. &quot;Vinyasa&quot; means flowing, and the poses are executed relatively rapidly, flowing continuously from one asana to the next using defined transitional movements. The asanas are grouped into six series, one Primary, one Intermediate, and four Advanced. Practice begins and ends with the chanting of mantras, followed by multiple cycles of the Sun Salutation, which &quot;forms the foundation of Ashtanga Yoga practice&quot;, and then one of the series. Ashtanga Vinyasa practice emphasises aspects of yoga other than asanas, including drishti (focus points), bandhas (energy locks), and pranayama.

Kripalu Yoga uses teachers from other asana traditions, focussing on mindfulness rather than using effort in the poses. Teachers may say &quot;allow your arms to float up&quot; rather than &quot;bring up your arms&quot;. The goal is to use the asanas &quot;as a path of transformation.&quot; The approach is in three stages: firstly instruction in body alignment and awareness of the breath during the pose; secondly, holding the pose long enough to observe &quot;unconscious patterns of tension in the body-mind&quot;; and thirdly, through &quot;deep concentration and total surrender&quot;, allowing oneself &quot;to be moved by prana&quot;. In Trikonasana, the teacher may direct pupils&#x27; attention to pressing down with the outer edge of the back foot, lifting the arch of the foot, and then experimenting with &quot;micro-movements&quot;, exploring where energy moves and how it feels.

In Bikram Yoga, as developed by Bikram Choudhury, there is a fixed sequence of 26 poses, in which Trikonasana is ninth, its task to focus on opening the hips. The Bikram version of Trikonasana is a different pose (Parsvakonasana) from that in Iyengar Yoga. The position of the feet is seen as critically important, along with proper breathing and the distribution of weight: about 30% on the back foot, 70% on the front foot.

Apart from the brands, many independent teachers, for example in Britain, offer an unbranded &quot;hatha yoga&quot;.

== Types ==
Asanas can be classified in different ways, which may overlap: for example, by the position of the head and feet (standing, sitting, reclining, inverted), by whether balancing is required, or by the effect on the spine (forward bend, backbend, twist), giving a set of asana types agreed by most authors. Mittra uses his own categories such as &quot;Floor &amp; Supine Poses&quot;. Darren Rhodes and others add &quot;Core strength&quot;, while Yogapedia and &quot;Yoga Journal&quot; also add &quot;Hip-opening&quot; to that set.
The table shows an example of each of these types of asana, with the title and approximate date of the earliest document describing (not only naming) that asana.

== In culture ==

===In religious art===

Religious Indian art makes use of a variety of seated asanas for figures of Buddha, Shiva, and other gods and religious figures. Most are meditation seats, especially the lotus position, Padmasana, but Lalitasana and its &quot;royal ease&quot; variant are not. Jain tirthankaras are often shown seated in the meditation asanas Siddhasana and Padmasana.

===In literature===

The actress Mariel Hemingway&#x27;s 2002 autobiography &quot;Finding My Balance: A Memoir with Yoga&quot; describes how she used yoga to recover balance in her life after a dysfunctional upbringing: among other things, her grandfather, the novelist Ernest Hemingway, killed himself shortly before she was born, and her sister Margaux killed herself with a drug overdose. Each chapter is titled after an asana, the first being &quot;Mountain Pose, or Tadasana&quot;, the posture of standing in balance. Other chapters are titled after poses including Trikonasana, Virabhadrasana, Janusirsasana, Ustrasana, Sarvangasana, and finally Garudasana, in each case with some life lesson related to the pose. For example, Garudasana, &quot;a balancing posture with the arms and legs intricately intertwined ... requires some flexibility, a lot of trust, and most of all, balance&quot;; the chapter recounts how she, her husband and her daughters all came close to drowning in canoes off Kauai, Hawaii.

Among yoga novels is the author and yoga teacher Edward Vilga&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Downward Dog&quot;, named for Adho Mukha Svanasana, which paints a humorously unflattering picture of a man of the world who decides to become a private yoga teacher in New York society. Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1964 novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; has the action hero James Bond visiting Japan, where he &quot;assiduously practised sitting in the lotus position.&quot; The critic Lisa M. Dresner notes that Bond is mirroring Fleming&#x27;s own struggles with the pose.

<text>Timnath-heres or Timnath-serah (), later Thamna, was the town given by the Israelites to Joshua according to the Hebrew Bible. He requested it and the people gave it to him &quot;at the order of the Lord&quot;. He built up the town and lived in it ().

According to the Septuagint version of the Book of Joshua, Joshua placed there &quot;the stone knives, with which he had circumcised the children of Israel&quot;.

According to the Bible, Joshua was buried there (). Jewish tradition also places the tomb of Caleb there.

In 2022, excavations by Israeli archaeologists were launched at Khirbet Tibnah in the West Bank, a hilltop site commonly identified as biblical Timnath.

==Etymology==
In and , the town is called &quot;Timnath-serah&quot;, whereas in it is named as &quot;Timnath-heres&quot;.

In the Talmud the town is mentioned in Bava Batra 122b, where &quot;heres&quot; is translated as &quot;earthenware,&quot; in reference to fruits in the area being as dry as earthenware prior to the arrival of Joshua. The word&#x27;s inversion, &quot;serah&quot; is defined as &quot;rotting,&quot; that after Joshua&#x27;s arrival, the fruits became so juicy that they could quickly rot.

==Location==
The town was located in the mountainous region of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. It has been variously identified with two possible locations, Kifl Hares and Khirbet Tibnah.

Both E. Schürer and archaeologist W. F. Albright identified Timnath-heres with &quot;Thamna&quot;, mentioned in Greco-Roman sources including the writings of Josephus. Eusebius, in his &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, mentions the site under the entry of Gaas (Mount Gaash), a mountain in Ephraim , &quot;near the village of Thamna.&quot;

Conder &amp; Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund, steering clear of committing themselves to pinpointing the position of the biblical Timnath-heres in either Kifl Haris or Khirbet Tibnah, mention only the classical references to the place &quot;Thamnatha&quot; / &quot;Thamna&quot; (as in Pliny, &quot;Hist. Nat.&quot; v. 14 and in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; 3.3.5), saying that this place is to be identified with the present ruin &quot;Tibneh&quot; (marked on sheet xiv), and that &quot;some have identified it with Timnath-heres.&quot;

During the first-century CE until its destruction, Thamna served as an administrative district (toparchy).

===Kifl Hares===
One possible location Timnath-heres has been identified with is the Palestinian village of Kifl Hares, located 6 kilometres west of Salfit in the West Bank.

===Khirbet Tibnah===
Another candidate is Khirbet Tibnah, located between Deir Nidham and Nabi Salih, east of the Israeli town of Shoham and near the settlement of Halamish. Various surveys have produced proof of habitation from the Bronze Age until the early Ottoman period, with various findings from the Iron Age and the Hasmonean, Roman, and Mamluk periods. The dig is led by Dvir Raviv, an archeologist who mapped the site in 2015. He made sketches of the location of tombs, assembled pottery shards and documented burial caves. The current excavation has unearthed a spear tip dated to the second century C.E. as well as pottery and coins.

<doc id="621815" wikidata="Q754758" url="?curid=621815" title="Saint-Chamond (tank)">
<text>The Saint-Chamond () was the second French tank to enter service during the First World War, with 400 manufactured from April 1917 to July 1918. Although not a tank by a strict definition of a heavily armoured turreted vehicle, it is generally accepted and described as such in accounts of early tank development. It takes its name from the commune of Saint-Chamond where its manufacturers Compagnie des forges et aciéries de la marine et d&#x27;Homécourt (FAMH) were based.

Born of the commercial rivalry existing with the makers of the Schneider CA1 tank, the Saint-Chamond was an underpowered and fundamentally inadequate design. Its principal weakness was its Holt caterpillar tracks. They were much too short in relation to the vehicle&#x27;s length and weight (23 tons). Later models attempted to rectify some of the tank&#x27;s original flaws by installing wider and stronger track shoes, thicker frontal armour and the more effective 75mm Mle 1897 field gun.

Altogether 400 Saint-Chamond tanks were built, including 48 unarmed caisson tanks. The Saint-Chamond tanks remained engaged in various actions until October 1918, belatedly becoming more effective since combat had moved out of the trenches and onto open ground. Eventually, the Saint-Chamond tanks were scheduled to be entirely replaced by imported British heavy tanks.

==Development==
===The Schneider===
In January 1915, the French arms manufacturer Schneider sent out its chief designer, Eugène Brillié, to investigate tracked tractors from the American Holt Company, at that time participating in a test programme in England. The original French project was to provide mobility to mechanical wire-cutting machines of the Breton-Pretot type. On his return Brillié, who had earlier been involved in designing armoured cars for Spain, convinced the company management to initiate studies on the development of a &quot;Tracteur blindé et armé&quot; (&quot;armoured and armed tractor&quot;), based on the Baby Holt chassis, two of which were ordered.

Experiments on the Holt caterpillar tracks started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a wheel-steered model and the all-caterpillar Baby Holt, showing the superiority of the latter. On 16 June, new experiments followed in front of the President of the French Republic, and on 10 September for Commander Ferrus, an officer who had been involved in the study (and ultimate abandonment) of the Levavasseur tank project in 1908.

In early 1916, the first prototype of the Schneider tank was assembled in an army workshop. It featured tracks from the American-made Holt caterpillar tractors that were already used in France for towing heavy artillery. Private Pierre Lescure designed the fighting compartment. Lieutenant Fouché lengthened the tracks to improve trench-crossing ability. In this early form the prototype of the Schneider was called &quot;Tracteur A&quot; - not for security reasons, but because nobody knew exactly how to call such vehicles; the French word &quot;char&quot; was not yet applied to tanks. Eugène Brillié, the chief designer at Schneider, rejected this &quot;Tracteur A&quot; prototype. Instead he had invented a tail for his own tank&#x27;s chassis thus providing the same trench crossing ability but for less overall weight and length.

===The Saint-Chamond===
While Brillié began to assemble this second prototype which was to become the Schneider CA1, the arms manufacturer &quot;Forges et Aciéries de la Marine et d&#x27;Homécourt&quot; (aka &quot;FAMH&quot;), based at Saint-Chamond, Loire, was given an order for 400 tanks by the French government, a political move prompted by General Mourret of the Army &quot;Service Automobile&quot;. Saint-Chamond intended to build a tank that would be partly similar to the Schneider. Brillié refused to share his patents for free, and Saint-Chamond refused to pay. As a result, the &quot;Forges et Acieries de la Marine et d&#x27;Homecourt&quot; company, being unable to replicate certain patented details (notably the tail) of the new Schneider tank, developed its own proprietary design: the &quot;Char Saint-Chamond&quot;. It included a &quot;Crochat-Colardeau&quot; gasoline-electric transmission, a traction system already used on railcars in service with the French railways. Furthermore, the freedom to design a heavier and larger tracked vehicle gave Saint-Chamond the opportunity to upstage the Schneider company. It did this by installing on its &quot;Char Saint-Chamond&quot; a more powerful, full size 75 mm field gun plus 4 Hotchkiss machine guns instead of the two machine guns present on the Schneider tank.
Saint-Chamond&#x27;s technical director was Colonel Émile Rimailho, an artillery officer who had become dissatisfied over the insufficient reward he had received for helping design the famous Canon de 75 modele 1897 field gun as well as the Modele 1904 155 mm &quot;Rimailho&quot; howitzer. Following his departure from the French State arsenal system (APX) and joining Saint-Chamond, Rimailho adapted a Mondragon designed 75 mm field gun for production for the Mexican Army. It was the proprietary Canon de 75mm TR Saint-Chamond (Modele 1915), designed to fire the regular French 75 mm ammunition. The French government had already made a commitment in May 1915 to purchase the Saint-Chamond 75mm gun. It is unclear whether the guns for the Saint-Chamond tanks were taken from existing stocks of Saint-Chamond guns or new production. Colonel Rimailho, who had a direct financial interest in selling his company&#x27;s gun, induced the Ministry of War to specify that the new Saint-Chamond tank would also mount the Saint-Chamond made 75mm. In so doing Rimailho had also upstaged the Schneider CA1 tank which could only be fitted with a smaller Schneider-made fortress gun firing a 75 mm reduced charge ammunition. To accommodate a regular length and full size 75 mm field gun, a hull longer than on the Schneider tank was essential. The earliest Saint-Chamond prototype, a tracked vehicle longer and heavier than the Schneider tank was first demonstrated to the French military in April 1916.

When Colonel Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne, who had taken the initiative to create the French tank arm, learned that an order for 400 additional tanks had been passed on April 8, 1916, he was at first quite elated. When it later became apparent that they would be of a different type, Estienne was shocked and wrote:

==Description==

As a result of Rimailho&#x27;s manipulations, the new tank had become a rather cumbersome and underpowered vehicle. It lacked a rotating turret, instead using a large overhanging front compartment housing the long 75 mm gun protruding from the nose. All French 75mm field guns at the time used the same method of traverse control: the whole gun carriage moved from side to side, pivoted on the end of the trail by a worm gear arrangement on the axle of the gun. This meant that the Saint-Chamond engineers had no option but to fit the whole gun into the fighting compartment.

Within the forward fighting compartment and on the left was the driver, also the vehicle commander. On the right a machine gunner operated the front Hotchkiss machine gun. This machine gunner was also responsible for the breech operation of the 75 mm gun which he had to perform after pivoting on his seat to the left. A loader (referred to in some sources as the gunner) adjusted the gun&#x27;s elevation, observing the target through a small hatch in the front of the tank, which left him vulnerable to enemy fire. Traversing the 75 mm gun beyond the limits of traverse of the gun (6° for Mle 1897) required traversing the whole tank, and this was performed by the driver. A second fighting compartment at the back held one machine gunner next to the secondary driver&#x27;s position, where the tank could also be driven backwards by the mechanic in an emergency. Between those two compartments stood in the open the gasoline engine and the electric generator. Narrow passageways on both sides of the engine connected the front and rear compartments. The passageways also held Hotchkiss positions, one on each side in front of the engine. Altogether, the Saint-Chamond had four Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun positions: one in the front, one in the back and one on each side of the tank.

Despite weighing 23 tons, the tank could manage a top speed of . This speed was seldom achieved in the field as the long nose was prone to digging into the ground. The relatively high maximum speed on flat ground was made possible by the &quot;Crochat Colardeau&quot; transmission which coupled a Panhard-Levassor four-cylinder sleeve-valve gasoline engine to an electric generator capable of giving an output of 260 amperes under 200 volts. The generator was connected to two separate electric motors, one for each track, thus permitting perfect gradual steering of the tank.

Due to its short tracks and over-extended body, the vehicle experienced major difficulties in crossing trenches and overcoming obstacles. This led to such negative reactions by the crews in training that a special mention was passed on to General Headquarters:

==Improved Saint-Chamond tanks (1918)==
Originally the crew of nine men was protected by 11 mm of steel armour on the sloping front and 17 mm on the sides. Later on, the addition of an extra layer of spaced 8.5 mm armour on the front improved protection. Beginning with the 151st vehicle, the roof was also redesigned with a double slope so that satchel charges and grenades would slide off. Concurrently, the original two observation turrets in front and on top were done away with and replaced by a single low profile square turret permitting front and sides vision by the tank&#x27;s driver/commander. With time, the tracks were gradually widened in three iterations from 324 mm to 412 mm, and later to 500 mm, to lower the tank&#x27;s ground pressure. After Saint-Chamond tank No 210 the more effective Model 1897 field gun was installed instead of Rimailho&#x27;s self-designed 75 mm Saint-Chamond gun. At about the same time barrel-like rollers were added underneath the front and rear of the tank to help crossing trenches. This improved version was later called, unofficially, the &quot;Modèle 18&quot;. Production slowed down in March 1918, after at least 377 had been assembled, and ceased completely in July 1918.

Initially, forty eight Saint-Chamond tanks were modified as supply and recovery vehicles that could tow the lighter Schneider tanks. Their first action as a fighting vehicle took place at Laffaux Mill on May 5, 1917. Sixteen Saint-Chamond tanks were engaged there, several of them getting stuck in trenches, but only three were destroyed in combat. During the rest of the war, twelve groups in total were formed with Saint-Chamond tanks : &quot;Artillerie Spéciale&quot; Nos. 31–42. In mid-1918, since combat had left the trenches for the open fields, it was used to engage German field gun batteries (&quot;Nahkampfbatterien&quot;) at a distance with its 75 mm cannon. The Saint-Chamond proved at last quite effective in this specialist assault gun role. The Saint-Chamond&#x27;s final engagement in battle, with initially 16 tanks, took place in early October 1918, in support of the U.S. First Division near Montfaucon. As reported in Ralph Jones et al. (1933) in reference to this last engagement : &quot;The Saint Chamond tanks were handicapped by damage to their tracks, by derailments, by the breakage of the caps of connecting rods on forward bogies and of track pins&quot;. By that time, the Renault FT tank had taken over the major role in the French tank force and had also been purchased by the American Expeditionary Forces in France.

After the war 54 were allegedly rebuilt as ammunition carriers; the remainder were largely scrapped. Very little evidence exists that any were used postwar as ammunition carriers at all. However, at least one Saint-Chamond was retained as a memorial: there was one at the École des Chars at Versailles from 1919 to 1940 when the Germans presumably scrapped it along with the other tanks on display. There are unsubstantiated stories about Poland using the tank against the Red Army in 1920. If true, these specimens were in all probability not from the Soviet Army as the latter never had been supplied with them and the French Expeditionary Forces to Russia were only equipped with the Renault FT.

==Surviving example==

The last Saint-Chamond tank remaining in existence, an improved mid-1918 model, alongside other French tanks of World War I (Schneider CA1 and Renault FT), is preserved at the Musée des Blindés at Saumur. It had survived, together with a Schneider CA1 tank of the same vintage, at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds Ordnance Museum in Maryland, US, and was donated by the U.S. to the French government in 1987. Between 2015 and 2017 it was restored to running condition and repainted in a World War I camouflage scheme, at a cost of €120,000. It took part in various displays throughout 2017 to mark the centenary of the first use of tanks by the French army.

A full-size replica in polystyrene foam, built by students of the Lycée Le Corbusier at Tourcoing, is on display outdoors at the &quot;Historial de la Grande Guerre&quot; museum in Péronne, France.
==In media==
* The 2022 film All Quiet on the Western Front shows several Saint-Chamond tanks attacking a German trenchline. The film used practical replicas based on a BMP-1 chassis. This is especially obvious since the tracks are visibly different from the period-correct Saint-Chamond.
* 2016: The Saint-Chamond tank is featured and playable in a Battlefield 1 by DICE studios and EA games under the abbreviation &quot;St-Chamond&quot;.

From 1978 to 1986, he created several hard-boiled comics with the scenarist Natsuo Sekigawa, such as &quot;City Without Defense&quot;, &quot;The Wind of the West Is White&quot;, and &quot;Lindo 3&quot;. From 1987 to 1996, Taniguchi and Natsuo Sekigawa produced the 5-volume series &quot;The Times of Botchan&quot;. In the 1990s, he came up with several albums, among which were , , and .

From 1980 to 1983, he collaborated with Garon Tsuchiya for the manga , , and .

He illustrated Baku Yumemakura&#x27;s works, &quot;Garōden&quot; from 1989 to 1990 and &quot;The Summit of the Gods&quot; from 2000 to 2003. He later received awards at the Angoulême International Comics Festival in 2002 and 2005. For &quot;The Summit of the Gods&quot;, he hiked to Kathmandu, Nepal, for research.

In 1997, he created the &quot;Icaro&quot; series with texts by Moebius.

Jiro Taniguchi gained several prizes for his work. Among others, the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize (1998) for the series &quot;The Times of Botchan&quot;, the Shogakukan Manga Award with &quot;Inu o Kau&quot;, and in 2003, the Alph&#x27;Art of the best scenario at the Angoulême International Comics Festival for &quot;A Distant Neighborhood&quot;. His work has been translated in many languages. Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro praised his work, stating that &quot;Taniguchi was a manga poet, the Kieslowski of the page and a serene, profound observer of the world&quot;.

&quot;A Distant Neighborhood&quot; was adapted into a live-action Belgian film in 2010.

Taniguchi has cited Hiroshi Hirata, Takao Saito, Moribi Murano, and Kyūta Ishikawa as major influences.

Taniguchi died on 11 February 2017 in Tokyo, at the age of 69.

<text>Grigory Abramovich Shajn () (April 19, 1892 – August 4, 1956) was a Soviet/Russian astronomer. In modern English transliteration, his surname would be given as Shayn, but his astronomical discoveries are credited under the name G. Shajn. Nonetheless, his last name is sometimes given as Schayn.

He earned a masters degree from Tomsk University in 1920.

He was the husband of Pelageya Shajn (Пелагея Фёдоровна Шайн) née Sannikova (Санникова), who was also a Russian astronomer.

He worked on stellar spectroscopy and the physics of gaseous nebulas. Together with Otto Struve, he studied the rapid rotation of stars of young spectral types and measured the radial velocities of stars. He discovered new gaseous nebulas and the anomalous abundance of 13C in stellar atmospheres.

He became a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1939, and was also a member of various foreign societies such as the Royal Astronomical Society. From 1945 to 1952 he was the director of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory.

He also discovered a few asteroids. He also co-discovered the non-periodic comet C/1925 F1 (Shajn-Comas Solá), also known as Comet 1925 VI or Comet 1925a. However, the periodic comet 61P/Shajn–Schaldach was co-discovered by his wife rather than by him.

The crater &quot;Shayn&quot; on the Moon is named after him. He and his wife were also honoured by the minor planet 1648 Shajna.

<doc id="621828" wikidata="Q781047" url="?curid=621828" title="Austin Blair">
<text>Austin Blair (February 8, 1818 – August 6, 1894) was a politician who served as the 13th governor of Michigan during the American Civil War and in Michigan&#x27;s House of Representatives and Senate as well as the U.S. Senate. He was known as a strong opponent of slavery and secession. He also led efforts to provide women and black citizens the right to vote. He simultaneously sought to ban capital punishment.

==Early life in New York==
Blair was born in Caroline, New York, in a log cabin built by his father George Blair of Scottish ancestry. It was reportedly the first cabin in Tompkins County, New York and Blair lived there until age 17, helping his father farm the land. He attended the common schools, Cazenovia Seminary and Hamilton College, before transferring to Union College in the middle of his junior year, graduating in 1839. Blair studied law in Owego, New York and was admitted to the bar in Tioga County, New York in 1841. He moved to Michigan in that year, residing first in Jackson before moving to Eaton Rapids.

==Politics in Michigan==
He began his political career in Eaton Rapids, where he was elected the clerk of Eaton County in 1842. He moved back to Jackson in 1844 and was a Whig member of the Michigan State House of Representatives from Jackson County in 1846. He served on the House Judiciary Committee and was the leading proponent of the successful 1846 effort to abolish capital punishment in Michigan. He also introduced legislation to allow black citizens the right to vote. He left the Whig Party because they did not take a strong anti-slavery stance, and was a delegate to the Free Soil Party National Convention in Buffalo, New York in 1848 which nominated Martin Van Buren.

In February 1849, Blair married Sarah L. Ford, of Seneca County New York. Together they had four sons; George who became a postal clerk in the railway mail service; Charles who became a partner with his father; the other two were Fred and Austin.

He was elected Jackson County prosecutor in 1852 and participated in organizing the Republican Party in 1854. He was chairman of the committee that drafted the Republican platform &quot;under the oaks&quot; in Jackson on July 6. He served in the Michigan Senate, where he represented the 12th district, from 1855 to 1856.

Blair was a delegate from Michigan to the 1860 Republican National Convention, which nominated Abraham Lincoln. He was also elected Governor of Michigan in that year and reelected in 1862, serving from 1861 to 1865.

==Civil War Governor==
In his first inaugural address in January 1861, Blair recommended that the state offer its entire military resources to Lincoln for maintaining the supremacy of the U.S. Constitution. Within days of the outbreak of the American Civil War in April, Blair responded by calling for ten companies of volunteers. The legislature later retroactively authorized the Governor&#x27;s quick actions, authorized a war loan of $1,000,000, and passed the Soldiers&#x27; Relief Law, requiring counties to provide relief to the families of soldiers. By mid-May, the first regiment of Michigan soldiers, under the command of Colonel O. B. Willcox had left to engage in the field of combat, and was the first western force to arrive at the seat of combat. The second regiment, under the command of Colonel Israel B. Richardson, soon followed.

While the third and fourth regiments were being raised, Blair received directions from the U.S. Secretary of War, limiting the number of regiments that would be accepted from Michigan to four and asked Blair not to raise more than that number. Blair decided to disregard these instructions and continued to establish the fifth, sixth, and seventh regiments, all of which had been deployed by mid-September. Under Blair&#x27;s guidance, Michigan continued to supply troops for the Union forces throughout the war. One notable unit was a colored unit, known as the 102nd United States Colored Troops, which included two sons of Sojourner Truth and Josiah Henson (the man Harriet Beecher Stowe used as the model for Uncle Tom). In 1862, he attended the Loyal War Governors&#x27; Conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania, which ultimately backed Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation and the Union war effort.

At the outset of the war, Michigan had a total population of approximately 800,000 and an estimated 110,000 able-bodied men capable of bearing arms. By the end of the war, more than 90,000 Michigan men had volunteered to fight. Blair personally helped to raise about $100,000 to organize and equip the initial muster of troops. When Blair left office in 1864, he was almost destitute, having expended much of his personal wealth in support of the war effort. During this time of conflict, Governor Blair ran the state government from his hometown of Jackson, making that community a hub of Michigan&#x27;s war effort.

Blair ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate, challenging the politically well-entrenched Zachariah Chandler who, although a fellow Republican, was seen by Blair as representing wealthy, Detroit interests rather than &quot;outstate&quot; interests.

==U.S. Congress, retirement and death==
Two years after leaving the Governor&#x27;s seat, Austin Blair was elected to the U.S. House representing Michigan&#x27;s 3rd congressional district from 1867 to 1873, serving in the 40th, 41st and 42nd Congresses. He was not a candidate for re-election in 1872, but unsuccessfully ran as the Liberal Republican candidate for Governor. He returned to Jackson to resume a private law practice. He was a member of the University of Michigan board of regents from 1881 to 1889. In 1883, Blair was nominated for Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court Republican party, but was defeated.

He died in Jackson and is interred at Mt. Evergreen Cemetery there.

In 1895, the Michigan legislature appropriated $10,000 (~$ in ) for a statue in Blair&#x27;s memory. It was to be placed on Capitol Square, the only time that an actual person has been honored with a statue on the Capitol&#x27;s grounds.

Blair Township in Grand Traverse County is named after Austin Blair.

<text>Laskar Jihad (English: &quot;Warriors of Jihad&quot;) was an Islamist and anti-Christian Indonesian militia, which was founded and led by Jafar Umar Thalib. At present, the militia is believed to have disbanded.

==History==
Laskar Jihad was founded in 2000 by Thalib, an Indonesian who had been trained in Pakistani madrasahs and who had fought together with the mujahadeen in Afghanistan. The primary cause for the creation of Laskar Jihad was the outbreak of sectarian violence in the Indonesian provinces of Maluku and North Maluku where clashes between Muslims and Christians erupted in 1999. Soon after its creation, Laskar Jihad opened recruitment centers in various parts of Indonesia. Muslims joining the militia came from Java, Sumatra, South Sulawesi and Kalimantan. Many of them were unemployed, while some were university students.

Laskar Jihad arrived in Ambon in May 2000 and then in other of the Maluku Islands (also known as the Moluccas) where the Islamist militia joined Maluku Muslims in the fighting with Christian groups, thereby exacerbating the ongoing violence. The intervention of Laskar Jihad soon gave Muslims the upper hand in the conflict, with the Islamists burning down churches and houses of the indigenous Melanesian communities in Ambon and other Moluccan islands. In the following two years, an estimated 9,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands had to flee their towns. Forced conversions and forced circumcisions of Christians took place in Maluku, while, according to witness accounts, present duty military and police personnel did not interfere. A Laskar Jihad member later recalled being welcomed by Indonesian soldiers who supplied the Islamist militia with standard military equipment.

Additionally, attacks were launched against Christian communities in Sulawesi. Laskar Jihad also sent militants to West Papua and Aceh, at opposite ends of the country.

In February 2002, the Malino II Accord between Muslims and Christians was signed, which demanded among other things the withdrawal of Laskar Jihad from the Maluku Islands. The militia, however, refused to oblige and continued activities in the region under the pretext of &quot;humanitarian work&quot;. Eventually, the peace agreement was followed by a decrease in violence in Maluku, though incidents continued through mid- and late 2002.

After the Bali bombings in October 2002, Laskar Jihad announced its alleged disbandment, but soon made a new appearance when it established an office in Sorong in the province of West Papua. Laskar Jihad has also been held responsible for attacks on Papuans. In May 2003, reports smuggled out of Papua claimed arson and machetes had been used to destroy ten townships, their food gardens and livestock, sending the surviving women and children into jungle hiding from their pursuers.

Laskar Jihad&#x27;s operations in Maluku and West Papua have been actively supported by parts of the Indonesian military. Much of the funding for the militia has come from within the military. Laskar Jihad fighters have been trained by the Indonesian military elite force Kopassus in a training camp near Bogor in West Java. Laskar Jihad members even received military escorts while travelling from West Java to Surabaya. The behaviour of the military in Maluku was similarly biased. Although at first a newly created military unit, the &quot;Joint Battalion&quot;, took action against Laskar Jihad in Maluku, it was replaced in mid-2001 by Kopassus, which was more sympathetic towards the militia.

Like the extremist Islamic Defenders Front, Laskar Jihad has also carried out attacks on bars, brothels and discothèques, which were perceived to be un-Islamic.

At present, Laskar Jihad is believed to have disbanded, although several scholars warn that the threat of a resurrection of the militia &quot;still bubbles just below the surface in Indonesia.&quot;

==Ideology==
Laskar Jihad leader Jafar Umar Thalib has voiced public support for the establishment of an Islamic theocracy in Indonesia. Members of his group have called for the introduction of the Sharia. They also resented the 2001 appointment of Megawati Sukarnoputri as President of Indonesia, stating that the appointment of a female president was a sin. In Laskar Jihad camps, women are required to wear burqas, and television is banned.

Thalib has met with Osama bin Laden, but allegedly turned down offers of funding support because of doubts about bin Laden&#x27;s piety. However, other members of his militia have accepted al-Qaeda support. Thalib, when asked by Jessica Stern whether he promotes Wahhabism in Indonesia, tried to distance himself from Wahhabism, stating that its literature would rely too heavily on weak hadith &quot;that may not be the word of Allah&quot;. However, scholars have noted that fatwas issued by Salafi muftis from the Arab Peninsula played a significant role in the formation of Laskar Jihad. It has also been argued that Thalib&#x27;s efforts to distance himself from al-Qaeda and anything related to it were made in the context of the September 11 terror attacks when the Indonesian government exerted strong pressure on Laskar Jihad not to exploit anti-American sentiment.

For its violent campaign in Maluku, Laskar Jihad put forward two reasons: first, the defence of fellow Muslims; and second, the fight against separatism. To justify the latter cause, Laskar Jihad even alleged a Zionist-Christian conspiracy trying to undermine the national unity of Indonesia.

<text>&quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is the fifth of the twelve stories in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

The story was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in November 1891. Conan Doyle later ranked the story seventh in a list of his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. This is also one of only two Sherlock Holmes short stories where Holmes&#x27; client dies after seeking his help; the other being &quot;The Adventure of the Dancing Men&quot;.

==Plot==
A young gentleman named John Openshaw visits Holmes one night with a strange story. His uncle Elias had emigrated to the United States as a young man, establishing himself as a planter in Florida and joining the Confederate States Army, in which he rose to the rank of colonel. In 1869 or 1870, he returned to England and purchased an estate near Horsham in Sussex, adopting a reclusive lifestyle. He later allowed John to live on the estate and gave him full access to the property, except for one storage room that was always kept locked.

On 10 March 1883, Elias received a letter postmarked Pondicherry, bearing the inscription &quot;K.K.K.&quot; and containing only five orange pips (seeds).

The arrival of this letter badly unnerved Elias, and he sent John to bring a lawyer to the estate. By the time John returned, Elias had retrieved a box marked &quot;K.K.K.&quot; from the locked room and burned its contents. Elias made a will naming his brother Joseph (John&#x27;s father) as his heir, with the intent that John should eventually inherit the estate from him. Elias&#x27;s already-reclusive behaviour became even more bizarre; he would either lock himself in his room and drink heavily, or rush about the grounds in a frenzy while carrying a pistol. On 2 May 1883, seven weeks after receiving the letter, he was found dead in a garden pool. The death was ruled a suicide, but John did not believe that Elias could have killed himself. 

Joseph took possession of the estate and examined the room, finding scattered records of Elias&#x27;s time in the United States. On 4 January 1885, he received a letter postmarked Dundee, identical to the one received by Elias and containing instructions to put &quot;the papers&quot; on the sundial in the garden. John realised that the papers being demanded must have been the ones burned by Elias. Despite John&#x27;s urging, Joseph decided not to involve the police. Three days later, he was found dead at the bottom of a chalk pit; the death was ruled an accident, but again John had his doubts. 

John has now received a letter postmarked London that orders him to put the papers on the sundial, but the local police are convinced that the letters are merely practical jokes. The only clue he can provide is a page from Elias&#x27;s diary, dated March 1869 and detailing that pips were sent to three men; two were later &quot;cleared&quot; and one was &quot;visited.&quot; Holmes suggests that John put the page in the box that had contained the other papers, along with a note detailing their destruction, and leave the box on the sundial. 

After John departs, Holmes deduces that Elias had returned to England and gone into hiding because something in the United States had prompted him to flee for his life, and that the letters were sent from a sailing ship based on their postmarks and the time lapse between the first two mailings and the recipients&#x27; deaths. He recognises &quot;K.K.K.&quot; as the Ku Klux Klan, an anti-Reconstruction group in the South that was active until its sudden collapse in 1869 – triggered, Holmes theorises, by Elias&#x27;s return to England with vital records that the other members have since been trying to recover. Opponents of the Klan would receive a warning, and would be killed unless they either fled or renounced their opposition.

The next morning&#x27;s newspaper carries an article on the discovery of John&#x27;s body in the River Thames, apparently the result of an accidental drowning after falling off the Waterloo Bridge. Now convinced that all three Openshaw men were murdered, Holmes spends the day checking the records of sailing ships and finds only one that could have been in Pondicherry, Dundee, and London when the letters were mailed – an American barque, the &quot;Lone Star&quot;. He puts five orange pips into an envelope with the note &quot;S.H. for J.O.&quot;, addresses it to the captain, and mails it to the vessel&#x27;s home port of Savannah, Georgia. He also sends a telegram to the Savannah police, informing them that the captain and mates – the only American crewmen – are wanted in England for murder.

Holmes&#x27; desire for vengeance ultimately goes unfulfilled, as the &quot;Lone Star&quot; is destroyed in a severe gale. No trace is ever found except for a broken sternpost marked &quot;L.S.&quot;, seen floating on the waves of the Atlantic Ocean.

==Note==
At the time of writing, the actual Ku Klux Klan was indeed broken and effectively defunct, and it would be decades before its 20th century revival. Conan Doyle&#x27;s taking it up in this story was in line with his recurrent theme of wild and violent Americans and other foreigners exporting their power struggles to Victorian Britain – which already formed the basis to &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot;, the very first Holmes mystery.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot; was first published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in November 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in December 1891. The story was published with six illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in October 1892.

==Adaptations==

===Radio===

Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which aired on 9 March 1931, starring Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. A remake of the script aired on 5 September 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. The episode aired on 1 February 1942.

A radio adaptation aired on the BBC Home Service in 1952, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson. It was adapted by Felix Felton. Other adaptations of the story in the same series aired on the BBC Home Service in 1957 (again adapted by Felton, with a slightly different supporting cast) and on the BBC Light Programme in 1966 (adapted by Michael Hardwick).

&quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot; was dramatised by Vincent McInerney for BBC Radio 4 in 1990 as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson.

A 2007 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

===Film and television===

The 1945 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the House of Fear&quot; is partly based on &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot;.

An episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; was based on the story. The episode, titled &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot;, aired in 2000.

The third episode of the 2010 BBC &quot;Sherlock&quot; series titled &quot;The Great Game&quot; made reference to five pips being sent by an assassin organization as a warning. In the episode, these pips were five electronic beeps, like the pips (the time signal) broadcast on the hour by the BBC&#x27;s analogue radio stations. The &quot;Sherlock&quot; 2016 Special &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot; also refers to the original short story, as a murder victim is mailed five orange pips as a threat before being killed. There is also a secret organisation—similar to the KKK only in its hooded costumes—related to the case in the episode.

The November 2014 episode of &quot;Elementary&quot; titled &quot;The Five Orange Pipz&quot; takes some story elements from this short story. The unusual &quot;Pipz&quot; spelling is the trademarked name of a fictional bead toy where a manufacturing error rendered the orange beads poisonous when ingested by children.

<doc id="621835" wikidata="Q16988933" url="?curid=621835" title="Kentucky River Palisades">
<text>The Kentucky River Palisades are a series of steep, scenic gorges and limestone outcroppings that stretch for approximately 100 mi (160 km), along the Kentucky River in central Kentucky in the United States.

==Geology==
The Kentucky River Palisades is a cliff-lined entrenched meander. The meanders originally formed on the Lexington Peneplain. As sea-level lowered during the Quaternary Period, base level lowered and the meander-form river eroded downward into Ordovician-age limestones, shales, and dolomites in the Central Bluegrass Region. The Lexington Limestone, which covers most of this area, is composed of interbedded shales and thin limestones. Erosion of these lithologies usually form gentle to moderate slopes. However, the Kentucky River Fault system, part of which runs along the Palisades, provides another controlling factor. Movement along the fault has been largely vertical. Strata on the north side of the fault were raised several hundred feet relative to those on the south side. The thick dolomites and limestones of the High Bridge Group (Tyrone, Oregon, and Camp Nelson formations) are resistant to erosion and tend to be cliff-forming. As downward erosion hit the Camp Nelson Group rocks, meander-shaped cliffs were formed. Daniel Boone&#x27;s Fort Boonesborough was sited close to the fault and the eastern end of the Palisades.

==Ecology==

The Palisades are considered by environmentalists to form a unique ecosystem in the region. Its topography, soil, and tree composition are different from the surrounding rolling plains. The display of spring ephemeral wildflowers is especially extravagant due to the rich limestone soils. The deep cliffs provide a habitat for four species of endangered bats as well as several rare and endangered plant species. The steep cliffs surrounding the Kentucky River harbor the largest concentration of forest within the Inner Bluegrass, which is otherwise developed or cleared. Blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata), chinquapin oak (Quercus muehlenbergii) and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) are abundant on the steep limestone slopes, along with less common trees like rock elm (Ulmus thomasi), yellowwood (Cladrastis lutea) and yellow buckeye (Aesculus octandra). Sites on old sandy river terraces and bluff-top ridges have more acid or infertile soils and harbor beech (Fagus) and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) trees more common in Appalachian Kentucky. Other uncommon woody species found in the Palisades include Paxistima, Chokecherry, and various types of Viburnums.

==Nature Preserves==

*Clyde E. Buckley Wildlife Sanctuary 
*Crutcher and Sally Brown 
*Floracliff (by guided hike only)
*Jim Beam 
*Dupree 
*Lower Howard&#x27;s Creek
*Raven Run 
*Tom Dorman State Nature Preserve

In 2007 the Kentucky State Parks announced the purchase of adjacent to Tom Dorman State Nature Preserve for the creation of the new Palisades State Park.

<text>Michele Bianchi (22 July 1883 – 3 February 1930) was an Italian revolutionary syndicalist leader who took a position in the Unione Italiana del Lavoro (UIL). He was among the founding members of the Fascist movement. He was widely seen as the dominant leader of the leftist, syndicalist wing of the National Fascist Party. He took an active role in the &quot;interventionist left&quot; where he &quot;espoused an alliance between nationalism and syndicalism.&quot; He was one of the most influential politicians of the regime before his succumbing to tuberculosis in 1930. He was also one of the grand architects behind the &quot;Great List&quot; (&quot;il listone&quot;) which secured the parliamentary majority in favor of the fascists.

==Biography==

===Socialism===
Bianchi was born in Belmonte Calabro (Calabria), in southern Italy.

He studied law at the University of Rome, and dedicated himself from early on to journalism. He became a member of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI), and editor of the Party newspaper &quot;Avanti!&quot;, presiding over the socialist branch in Rome. A delegate to the Bologna Congress in 1904, he backed the syndicalist line enforced by Arturo Labriola.

In 1905, Bianchi renounced his position at &quot;Avanti!&quot; and took over leadership of the &quot;Gioventù socialista&quot; (paper of the Federazione dei Giovani Socialisti—youth wing of the PSI). The antimilitarist campaign he led had him imprisoned, then forcibly settled in Genoa. Bianchi adapted to his new residence, and became head of the Ligurian Labor Chamber, as well as editor of the revolutionary paper &quot;Lotta socialista&quot;.

===Syndicalism===
In 1906, after backing several workers&#x27; riots, Bianchi expressed his pacifism in front of the PSI leadership, and was not universally welcomed. Transferred to Savona, he played a crucial part in the events that led the syndicalists out of the PSI—in between the PSI Bologna Congress of 1907 and the first Syndicalist Congress in July 1908 (in Ferrara).

After being arrested several times and travelling throughout Italy, Bianchi became editor of &quot;La Scintilla&quot; in 1910; he launched the idea that PSI and syndicalists should reunite on electoral lists for the expected administrative elections. He was outvoted, and resorted to expressing his views solely through the paper—which he turned into a daily, the backer of several local proletarian revolts in 1911.

However, Bianchi was forced by the tight budget to shut down &quot;La Scintilla&quot;, not before he was yet again arrested in Trieste for attacking Giovanni Giolitti as instigator of the Italo-Turkish War. He benefited from an amnesty and returned to Ferrara, where he created and headed the paper &quot;La Battaglia&quot; (a failed attempt to gain a seat in the elections of 1913). Bianchi moved to Milan, becoming a major figure of the Milanese Syndical Union and the Unione Sindacale Italiana (USI).

===Fascism===

Michele Bianchi&#x27;s attitude during World War I mirrored that of Benito Mussolini: he became an active supporter of Italy&#x27;s entry into the conflict, and advocate of irredentism.

In 1915, when Italy joined the Entente Powers, Bianchi volunteered for service and became a junior officer—first in the Infantry, then in the Artillery. With the end of the war, Bianchi joined Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;Fasci italiani di combattimento&quot;, and then the National Fascist Party (&quot;Partito Nazionale Fascista&quot;, or PNF). In 1921, he became the PNF secretary, and attempted to join the Fascists with other right-wing movements (while authorizing the numerous violent raids carried out by the Blackshirts).

After stomping out a strike action against Fascist maneuvers, Bianchi was one of the &quot;Quattuorvirate&quot; who led the March on Rome, the pseudo-coup d&#x27;état that brought Mussolini as prime minister (October 1922). In the newly formed government, he was general secretary of National Fascist Party, and considered as &quot;Mussolini&#x27;s closest collaborator.&quot; In short time, Bianchi was dismissed as PNF leader in 1923, while joining the Grand Council of Fascism; in 1924, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, but resigned from his government position on 14 March.

In 1925, he was given the position of undersecretary at the Ministry of Public Works, in 1928 the same position at the Internal Affairs one, and on 12 September 1929 he became Minister of Public Works. Again elected to the Chamber, and in failing health, he died soon after in Rome.

<doc id="621840" wikidata="Q2427972" url="?curid=621840" title="Tinfoil barb">
<text>The tinfoil barb (Barbonymus schwanenfeldii) is a tropical Southeast Asian freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae. This species was originally described as &quot;Barbus schwanenfeldii&quot; by Pieter Bleeker in 1853, and has also been placed in the genera &quot;Barbodes&quot; and &quot;Puntius&quot;. The specific epithet is frequently misspelled &quot;schwanefeldii&quot;.

Nowadays it is usually placed in the genus &quot;Barbonymus&quot;, which was only established in 1999. It is the genus&#x27; type species, and indeed seems to represent a quite distinct lineage of large &quot;barbs&quot;. It is not very similar to the barbels which are the core of the genus &quot;Barbus&quot;, and though closer to these than to some African barbs, they seem to be closer still to the common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;) and to &quot;Cyclocheilichthys&quot; than to either of the aforementioned.

It is distinguishable from other species of the genus in having a red dorsal fin with a black blotch at the tip, red pectoral, pelvic and anal fins, red caudal fin with white margin and a black submarginal stripe along each lobe, and 8 scale rows between dorsal-fin origin and lateral line. Large individuals are silvery or golden yellow while alive with its dorsal fin red and caudal fin orange or blood-red. It grows up to in length. Tinfoil barbs have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years.

Originating in the Mekong and Chao Phraya basins of Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Sumatra, Borneo, and Malayan peninsula, the tinfoil barb is found in rivers, streams, canals, and ditches. It also enters flooded fields. Its natural habitat is in water with a 6.5–7.0 pH, a water hardness of up to 10 dGH, and a temperature range of . In Indonesia, a temperature range of 20.4 °C to 33.7 °C was recorded for this species. It is largely herbivorous, consuming aquatic macrophytes and submerged land plants, as well as filamentous algae and occasionally insects. It also feeds on small fishes, worms, and crustaceans.

The tinfoil barb is commercially important in the aquarium hobby trade, as well as commercial aquaculture, subsistence farming, and occasionally as bait. It is usually marketed fresh.

There are no obvious distinguishing characteristics used to determine the sex of the fish. They reproduce by egg scattering of several thousand eggs per spawning. They are not often bred in captivity for the aquarium trade due to their large size.

==Parasites==
As most fish, the tinfoil barb harbours a number of parasite species. A 2023 study found that fish imported from Sri Lanka and Thailand harboured at least three species of monogeneans on their gills: &quot;Dactylogyrus lampam&quot; , &quot;D. tapienensis&quot; and &quot;D. viticulus&quot; .

==In the aquarium==
The tinfoil barb is a schooling species that prefers to be placed with a number of its own species. It prefers living in water with strong currents similar to those found in their native streams. It is also recommended that they be kept with fish of similar size or larger. Many unwary buy young specimens and find out too late how large the tinfoil barb can grow. The tinfoil barb is often seen in large aquaria as companions to large cichlids e.g. the oscar cichlid, &quot;Astronotus ocellatus&quot;.
The tinfoil barb is an active, peaceful species that spends most of its time in the mid-level and bottom of the water. A greedy eater, it will attempt to fill its mouth with as much food as possible during feedings. In captivity, it will eat almost anything provided to it.

<text>The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a short-legged hunting breed of dog of the scent hound type, originally from Brittany, a historical duchy of France.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a smallish hound, built along the same lines as the Basset Hound, but lighter all through and longer in the leg. Wire-coated, the coat is very harsh to the touch, dense, red-wheaten or fawn, sometimes with white markings on the chest. They measure 32 – 38 cm in height and weigh between 36 - 40 lbs but due to the historically controversial practice of registering mixed litters of Griffon and Basset Fauves, sometimes a litter of bassets will produce dogs with long legs. They have coarse, dense fur which may require stripping. Although their coat repels dirt and does not mat easily, they still require weekly combing and brushing. The hair on the ears is shorter, finer and darker than that on the coat. The ears just reach the end of the nose rather than trailing on the ground and should be pleated. They should have dark eyes and nose and ideally no crook on the front legs. The French standard says these are the shortest backed of all the basset breeds so they generally do not appear as exaggerated as the British Basset.

==Health==
A 2006 study found a relatively low inbreeding coefficient, at 3.9%, the second-lowest of the nine French breeds in the study.

The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is one of the more commonly affected breeds for primary open angle glaucoma. An autosomal recessive mutation of the ADAMTS17 gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

==History==
The breed was developed in France as a hunting dog from the larger Grand Fauve de Bretagne, a breed that is now extinct. There was a rumour that the Basset Fauve de Bretagne was also close to extinction after the Second World War, and the breed was recreated using the remaining examples of the breed and crossing in standard wirehaired Dachshunds. However, the French club denies this, and says that Basset Fauve numbers were never so low. In 2002, there were 1060 new registrations of the Basset Fauve in France.

The breed in the UK is mainly seen as a show dog and family pet, finally coming off the Kennel Club&#x27;s rare breed register in 2007. In the UK, under 140 dogs are registered a year. It can also be found in other parts of Europe where it is used to scent trail and also as a family pet.

<text>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (; born 15 September 1977) is a Nigerian author and activist. Regarded as a central figure in postcolonial feminist literature, she is the author of the novels &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; (2003), &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; (2006) and &quot;Americanah&quot; (2013). Her other works include the book of essays &quot;We Should All Be Feminists&quot; (2014); &quot;Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions&quot; (2017); a memoir, &quot;Notes on Grief&quot; (2021); and a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Sleeping Scarf&quot; (2023).

Born and raised in Enugu, Adichie studied medicine and pharmacology for a year and half at the University of Nigeria. At 19, she left Nigeria for the United States to study at Drexel University, and would later study at three universities: Eastern Connecticut State University, Johns Hopkins University, and Yale University. She first published &quot;Decisions&quot;, a poetry collection, in 1997, which she followed with a play, &quot;For Love of Biafra&quot;, in 1998. She published &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; in 2003. Her father&#x27;s story during the war supplied material for her second novel &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;.

Citing Chinua Achebe and Buchi Emecheta as inspiration, Adichie&#x27;s style juxtaposes Western and African influences, with particular influence from the Igbo culture. Most of her works, including her writing and speeches, explore the themes of religion, immigration, gender and culture. She also uses fashion as a medium to break down stereotypes, and was recognised with a Shorty Award in 2018 for her &quot;Wear Nigerian Campaign&quot;. Adichie&#x27;s 2009 TED Talk, &quot;The Danger of a Single Story&quot; is one of the most viewed TED Talks and her 2012 talk, &quot;We Should All Be Feminists&quot; was sampled by American singer Beyoncé as well as featured on a T-shirt by the French fashion house Dior in 2016. Adichie has received numerous academic awards, fellowships, and other honours, among them a MacArthur Fellowship in 2008 and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017.

==Name==
Bearing Amanda as her English name, she made up the Igbo name &quot;Chimamanda&quot; in the 1990s to keep her legal English name and conform with the Igbo Christian naming customs.

==Life and career==
===Early life and family===
Adichie was born on 15 September 1977 in Enugu, Enugu State, Nigeria to parents of Igbo origin. Her parents Grace (née Odigwe) and James Nwoye Adichie married on 15 April 1963. Adichie&#x27;s father moved with his wife to Berkeley to complete his PhD at the University of California. James was born in Abba in Anambra State. He graduated in 1957 with a degree in mathematics at University College, Ibadan and began working as a professor at the University of Nigeria (UNN) in 1966. Adichie&#x27;s mother was born in Umunnachi, also in Anambra State, and began her university studies in 1964 at Merritt College in Oakland. She later earned a degree in sociology and anthropology from University of Nigeria Nsukka.

When the Biafran War broke out in 1967, James started working for the Biafran government at the Biafran Manpower Directorate. Adichie lost her maternal and paternal grandfathers during the war. After Biafra ceased to exist in 1970, James returned to UNN while Grace worked for the government in Enugu until 1973 when she became an administration officer at UNN, and later the first female registrar. Her siblings include Ijeoma Rosemary, Uchenna &quot;Uche&quot;, Chukwunweike &quot;Chuks&quot;, Okechukwu &quot;Okey&quot;, and Kenechukwu &quot;Kene&quot;. The family stayed at the University of Nigeria campus in the house previously occupied by Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe. Adichie was raised Catholic, and the family&#x27;s parish was St. Paul&#x27;s Parish in Abba. Adichie&#x27;s father died of kidney failure in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and her mother died in 2021.

===Secondary school and university===

Adichie began her formal education, which included both Igbo and English. Although Igbo was not a popular subject, she continued taking courses in the language throughout high school. She completed her secondary education at the University of Nigeria Campus Secondary School, with top distinction in the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), and numerous academic prizes. She was admitted to the University of Nigeria, where she studied medicine and pharmacy for a year and half, and served as the editor of &quot;The Compass&quot;, a student-run magazine in the university. In 1997, at the age of 19, Adichie published &quot;Decisions&quot;, a collection of poems, and moved to the United States to study communications at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1998, she wrote a play called &quot;For Love of Biafra&quot;. Her early works were written under the name Amanda N. Adichie.

Two years after moving to the United States, Adichie transferred to Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic, Connecticut, where she lived with her sister Ijeoma, who was a medical doctor there. In 2000, she published her short story &quot;My Mother, the Crazy African&quot;, which discusses the problems that arise when a person is facing two completely opposite cultures. After finishing her undergraduate degree, she continued studying and simultaneously pursued a writing career. While a senior at Eastern Connecticut, she wrote articles for the university paper &quot;Campus Lantern.&quot; She received her bachelor&#x27;s degree &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a major in political science and a minor in communications in 2001. She later earned a master&#x27;s degree in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University in 2003 and, for the next two years, was a Hodder Fellow at Princeton University, where she taught introductory fiction. She began studying at Yale University, and completed a second master&#x27;s degree in African studies in 2008. Adichie received a MacArthur Fellowship that same year, plus other academic prizes, including the 2011–2012 Fellowship of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University.

=== Inspiration and marriage ===
As a child, Adichie read only English-language stories especially by Enid Blyton. Her juvenilia included stories with characters who were white and blue-eyed, modeled on British children she had read about. At ten, she discovered African literature and read &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; by Chinua Achebe, &quot;The African Child&quot; by Camara Laye, &quot;Weep Not, Child&quot; by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, and &quot;Joys of Motherhood&quot; by Buchi Emecheta. Adichie began to study her father&#x27;s Biafran stories when she was thirteen. In visits to Abba, she saw destroyed houses and rusty bullets scattered on the ground, and would later incorporate them and her father&#x27;s accounts into her novels.

Adichie married Ivara Esege, a Nigerian doctor, in 2009, and their first daughter was born in 2016. In 2024 the couple had twins. In an interview with The Guardian Newspapers, Adichie said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to leave such a long gap between novels,&quot; &quot;When I got pregnant, something just happened. I had a number of years in which I was almost existentially frightened that I wouldn&#x27;t write again. It was unbearable.
The family primarily lives in the United States because of Esege&#x27;s medical practice, but they also maintain a home in Nigeria. Adichie has Nigerian nationality and permanent resident status in the US.

===Writing background===
While studying in the US, Adichie started researching and writing her first novel, &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;. She wrote it during a period of homesickness and set it in her childhood home of Nsukka. The book explores post-colonial Nigeria during a military coup d&#x27;état, examines the cultural conflicts between Christianity and Igbo traditions, and touches on themes of class, gender, race, and violence. She sent her manuscript to publishing houses and literary agents, who either rejected it or requested that she change the setting from Africa to America to make it more familiar to a broader range of readers. Eventually, Djana Pearson Morris, a literary agent working at Pearson Morris and Belt Literary Management, accepted the manuscript. Although Morris recognised that marketing would be challenging, since Adichie was Black but neither African-American nor Caribbean. She submitted the manuscript to publishers until it was eventually accepted by Algonquin Books, a small independent company, in 2003. Algonquin published the manuscript and created support for the book by providing advance copies to booksellers, reviewers, and media houses, and sponsoring Adichie on a promotional tour. They also sent the manuscript to Fourth Estate, who accepted the book for publication in the United Kingdom in 2004. During that period, Adichie hired an agent, Sarah Chalfant of the Wylie Agency, to represent her. &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; was later published by Kachifo Limited in Nigeria in 2004, and subsequently translated into more than 40 languages.

After her first book, Adichie began writing &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, which she researched for four years, including studying Buchi Emechetas 1982 novel &quot;Destination Biafra&quot;. The book was published in 2006 by Anchor Books, a trade-paperback imprint of Alfred A. Knopf, which also released the book later under its Vintage Canada label. It was also published in France as in 2008, by Éditions Gallimard. The novel expands on the Biafran conflict, weaving together a love story that includes people from various regions and social classes of Nigeria, and how the war and encounters with refugees changes them.

While completing her Hodder and MacArthur fellowships, Adichie published short stories in various magazines. Twelve of these stories were collected into her third book, &quot;The Thing Around Your Neck&quot;, published by Knopf in 2009. The stories focuses on the experiences of Nigerian women, living at home or abroad, examining the tragedies, loneliness, and feelings of displacement resulting from their marriages, relocations, or violent events. &quot;The Thing Around Your Neck&quot; was a bridge between Africa and the African diaspora, which was also the theme of her fourth book, &quot;Americanah&quot;, published in 2013. It was the story of a young Nigerian woman and her male schoolmate, who had not studied the trans-Atlantic slave trade in school and had no understanding of the racism associated with being Black in the United States or class structures in the United Kingdom. It explores the central message of a &quot;shared Black consciousness&quot;, as both of the characters, one in Britain and the other in America, experiences a loss of their identity when they try to navigate their lives abroad.

Adichie was invited to be a visiting writer at the University of Michigan in Flint in 2014. The Renowned African Writers/African and African Diaspora Artists Visit Series required her to engage with students and teachers from high schools and universities, patrons of the local public library, and the community at large through forums, workshops, and lectures that discussed &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, &quot;Americanah&quot;, and her personal writing experiences. Clips from her talks &quot;The Danger of a Single Story&quot; and &quot;We Should All Be Feminists&quot; were also aired at some of the events and discussed in the question-and-answer segment following her presentations. In 2015, Adichie wrote a letter to a friend and posted it on Facebook in 2016. Comments on the post convinced her to turn to a book, &quot;Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions&quot;, which was an expansion of her ideas on how to raise a feminist daughter. The book was published in 2017. In 2020, Adichie published &quot;Zikora&quot;, a stand-alone short story about sexism and single motherhood, and an essay &quot;Notes on Grief&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, after her father&#x27;s death. She expanded the essay into a book of the same name, which was published by Fourth Estate the following year.

In 2020, Adichie adapted &quot;We Should All Be Feminists&quot; for children, in an edition illustrated by Leire Salaberria. Translations of it were authorised for publication in Croatian, French, Korean, Portuguese, and Spanish. Adichie spent a year and a half writing her first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Sleeping Scarf&quot;, which was published in 2023 by HarperCollins under the pseudonym &quot;Nwa Grace James&quot;. Joelle Avelino, a Congolese-Angolan artist, illustrated the book. The book tells the story of the connections between generations through family interactions with a head scarf.

==Style==
===Language===
Adichie uses both Igbo and English in her works, with Igbo phrases shown in italics and followed by an English translation. She uses figures of speech, especially metaphors, to trigger sensory experiences. For example, in &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, the arrival of a king to challenge colonial and religious leaders symbolises Palm Sunday, and the usage of language referencing Chinua Achebe&#x27;s &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; invokes the memories of his work to her readers. Similarly, the name of Kambili, a character in &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, evokes &quot;&quot; (&quot;Live and Let Live&quot;), the title of a song by Igbo musician Oliver De Coque. To describe pre- and post-war conditions, she moves from good to worse as seen in &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, in which one of her characters begins by opening the refrigerator and sees oranges, beer, and a &quot;roasted shimmering chicken&quot;. These contrast to later in the novel where one of her characters dies of starvation, and others are forced to eat powdered eggs and lizards.

Adichie usually uses real places and historic figures to draw readers into her stories.

===Culture===
In developing characters, Adichie often exaggerates attitudes to contrast the differences between traditional and western cultures. Her stories often point out failed cultures, particularly those which leave her characters in a limbo between bad options. At times, she creates a character as an oversimplified archetype of a particular aspect of cultural behavior to create a foil for a more complex character.
===Igbo tradition===
Adichie gives her characters recognisable common names for an intended ethnicity, such as Mohammed for a Muslim character. For Igbo characters, she invents names that convey Igbo naming traditions and depict the character&#x27;s traits, personality, and social connections. For example, in &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, the character&#x27;s name Ọlanna literally means &quot;God&#x27;s Gold&quot;, but Nwankwọ points out that means precious and means father (which can be understood as either God the father or a parent). By shunning popular Igbo names, Adichie intentionally imbues her characters with multi-ethnic, gender-plural, global personas. She typically does not use English names for African characters but, when she does, it is a device to represent negative traits or behaviours.

Adichie draws on figures from Igbo oral tradition to present facts in the style of historical fiction. She breaks with tradition in a way that contrasts with traditional African literature, given that women writers were often absent from the Nigerian literary canon, and female characters were often overlooked or served as supporting material for male characters who were engaged in the socio-political and economic life of the community. Her style often focuses on strong women and adds a gendered perspective to topics previously explored by other authors, such as colonialism, religion, and power relationships.

Adichie often separates characters into social classes to illustrate social ambiguities and traditional hierarchies. By using narratives from characters of different segments of society, as she reiterates in her TED talk, &quot;The Danger of a Single Story&quot;, she conveys the message that there is no single truth about the past. Adichie is encouraging her readers to recognise their own responsibility to one another, and the injustice that exists in the world. Nigerian scholar Stanley Ordu classifies Adichie&#x27;s feminism as womanist because her analysis of patriarchal systems goes beyond sexist treatment of women and anti-male bias, looking instead at socio-economic, political and racial struggles women face to survive and cooperate with men. For example, in &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, the character Auntie Ifeoma embodies a womanist view through making all family members to work as a team and with consensus, so that each person&#x27;s talents are utilised to their highest potential.

In both her written works and public speaking, Adichie incorporates humour, and uses anecdotes, irony and satire to underscore a particular point of view. Adichie has increasingly developed a contemporary Pan-Africanist view of gender issues, becoming less interested in the way the West sees Africa and more interested in how Africa sees itself.

==Themes==
Adichie, in a 2011 conversation with Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina, stated that the overriding theme of her works was love. Using the feminist argument &quot;The personal is political&quot;, love in her works is typically expressed through cultural identity, personal identity and the human condition, and how social and political conflict impact all three. Adichie frequently explores the intersections of class, culture, gender, (post-)imperialism, power, race and religion. Struggle is a predominant theme throughout African literature, and her works follow that tradition by examining families, communities, and relationships. Her explorations go beyond political strife and the struggle for rights, and typically examine what it is to be human. Many of her writings deal with the way her characters reconcile themselves with trauma in their lives and how they move from being silenced and voiceless to self-empowered and able to tell their own stories.

Adichie&#x27;s works, beginning with &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, generally examine cultural identity. Igbo identity is typically at the forefront of her works, which celebrate Igbo language and culture, and African patriotism, in general. Her writing is an intentional dialogue with the West, intent on reclaiming African dignity and humanity. A recurring theme in Adichie&#x27;s works is the Biafran War. The civil war was a &quot;defining moment&quot; in the post-colonial history of Nigeria, and examining the conflict dramatises the way in which the country&#x27;s identity was shaped. &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, her major work on the war, highlights how policies, corruption, religious dogmatism and strife played into the expulsion of the Igbo population and then forced their reintegration into the nation. Both actions had consequences, and Adichie presents the war as an unhealed wound because of political leaders&#x27; reluctance to address the issues that sparked it.

The University of Nigeria, Nsukka reappears in Adichie&#x27;s novels to illustrate the transformative nature of education in developing political consciousness, and symbolises the stimulation of Pan-African consciousness and a desire for independence in &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;. It appeared in both &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; and &quot;Americanah&quot; as the site of resistance to authoritarian rule through civil disobedience and dissent by students. The university teaches the colonial accounts of history and develops the means to contest its distortions through indigenous knowledge, by recognising that colonial literature tells only part of the story and minimises African contributions. Adichie illustrates this in &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, when mathematics instructor , explains to his houseboy, , that he will learn in school that the Niger River was discovered by a white man named Mungo Park, although the indigenous people had fished the river for generations. However, Odenigbo cautions Ugwu that, even though the story of Park&#x27;s discovery is false, he must use the wrong answer or he will fail his exam.

Adichie&#x27;s works about African diaspora consistently examine themes of belonging, adaptation and discrimination. This is often shown as an obsession to assimilate and is demonstrated by characters changing their names, a common theme in Adiche&#x27;s short fiction, which serves to point out hypocrisy. By using the theme of immigration, she is able to develop dialogue on how her characters&#x27; perceptions and identity are changed by living abroad and encountering different cultural norms. Initially alienated by the customs and traditions of a new place, the characters, such as Ifemelu in &quot;Americanah&quot;, eventually discover ways to connect with new communities. Ifemelu&#x27;s connections are made through self-exploration, which, rather than leading to assimilating into her new culture, lead her to a heightened awareness of being part of the African diaspora, and adoption of a dual perspective that reshapes and transforms her sense of self. Awareness of Blackness as part of identity, initially a foreign concept to Africans upon arriving in the United States, is shown not only in those works, but also in her feminist tract, &quot;Dear Ijeawele or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions&quot;. In it, she evaluates themes of identity that recur in &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Thing Around Your Neck&quot; such as stereotypical perceptions of Black women&#x27;s physical appearance, their hair and their objectification. &quot;Dear Ijeawele&quot; stresses the political importance of using African names, rejecting colorism, exercising freedom of expression in how they wear their hair (including rejecting patronising curiosity about it) and avoiding commodification, such as marriageability tests, which reduce a woman&#x27;s worth to that of a prize, seeing only her value as a man&#x27;s wife. Her women characters repeatedly resist being defined by stereotypes and embody a quest for women&#x27;s empowerment.

Adichie&#x27;s works often deal with inter-generational explorations of family units, allowing her to examine differing experiences of oppression and liberation. In both &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; and &quot;The Headstrong Historian&quot;—one of the stories included in &quot;The Thing Around Your Neck&quot;—Adichie examined these themes using the family as a miniature representation of violence. Female sexuality, both within patriarchal marriage relationships and outside of marriage, is a theme that Adichie typically uses to explore romantic complexities and boundaries. Her work discusses homosexuality in the context of marital affairs in stories such as &quot;Transition to Glory&quot;, and taboo topics such as romantic feelings for clergy in &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, as well as the seduction of a friend&#x27;s boyfriend in &quot;Light Skin&quot;. Miscarriage, motherhood and the struggles of womanhood are recurring themes in Adichie&#x27;s works, and are often examined in relation to Christianity, patriarchy, and social expectation. For example, in the short story &quot;Zikora&quot;, she deals with the interlocking biological, cultural and political aspects of becoming a mother and expectations placed upon women. The story examines the failure of contraception and an unexpected pregnancy, abandonment by her partner, single motherhood, social pressure and Zikora&#x27;s identity crisis, and the various emotions she experiences about becoming a mother.

Adichie&#x27;s works show a deep interest in the complexities of the human condition. Recurrent themes are forgiveness and betrayal, as in &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;, when Olanna forgives her lover&#x27;s infidelity, or Ifemelu&#x27;s decision to separate from her boyfriend in &quot;Americanah&quot;. Adichie&#x27;s examination of war shines a light on how both sides of any conflict commit atrocities and neither side is blameless for the unfolding violence. Her narrative demonstrates that knowledge and understanding of diverse classes and ethnic groups is necessary to create harmonious multi-ethnic communities. Other forms of violence—including sexual abuse, rape, domestic abuse, and rage—are repeated themes in &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot;, &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; and the stories collected in &quot;The Thing Around Your Neck&quot;, these themes symbolise the universality of power, or the impact and manifestation in society of its misuse.

==Views==
===Feminist fashion===

Adichie, in a 2014 article written for &quot;Elle&quot;, described becoming aware of a Western social norm that &quot;women who wanted to be taken seriously were supposed to substantiate their seriousness with a studied indifference to appearance.&quot; The western concept contrasted with her upbringing in Nigeria, because in West Africa the attention that a person pays to their fashion and style correlates to the amount of prestige and respectability they will be given by society. She began to recognise that people were judged for the way that they dressed. In particular, women writers wrote disparagingly about or trivialised attention to fashion, depicting woman who enjoyed fashion and makeup as silly, shallow or vain and without any depth. Acknowledging the relationship between beauty, fashion, style and socio-political inequalities, Adichie became committed to promoting body positivity as a means to acquire agency. She began to focus on body politics, taking particular pride in her African features such as her skin colour, hair texture and curves, and wearing bold designs featuring bright colours to make a statement about self-empowerment.

Adichie was included on &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;s 2016 International Best-Dressed List, and cited Michelle Obama as her style idol. That year, Maria Grazia Chiuri, the first female creative director of French fashion company Dior, featured in her debut collection a T-shirt with the title of Adichie&#x27;s TED talk, &quot;We Should All Be Feminists&quot;. Adichie was surprised to learn that Dior had never had a woman rule its creative division and agreed to a collaboration with Chiuri, who invited her as an honoured guest to sit in the front-row of the company&#x27;s spring runway show during the 2016 Paris Fashion Week. Scholar Matthew Lecznar stated that Adichie often challenges feminist stereotypes through references to fashion. He stated that allowing Dior to feature her text was a skillful way to use various media forms to not only deliver political messaging, but also to develop her image as a multi-faceted intellectual, literary and fashionable &quot;transmedia phenomenon&quot;. She became the face of No.7, a makeup brand division of British drugstore retailer Boots. In her 2016 Facebook post &quot;Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions&quot;, Adichie argued that minimising femininity and its expression through fashion and makeup is &quot;part of a culture of sexism&quot;.

On 8 May 2017, Adichie announced her &quot;Wear Nigerian&quot; campaign on her Facebook page. The Nigerian government had launched a &quot;Buy Nigerian to Grow the Naira&quot; campaign after the Nigerian naira experienced a devaluation. She set up an Instagram account that her nieces Chisom and Amaka managed, and gained around 600,000 followers. Adichie&#x27;s goal was to help protect Nigeria&#x27;s cultural heritage by showcasing the quality of craftsmanship and use of innovative hand-made techniques, materials and textiles being used by Nigerian designers. Just as important was the idea of persuading Nigerians to buy local products, as opposed to purchasing garments abroad, as had been done in the past. The posts on her page do not focus on her private life, but instead highlight her professional appearances all over the world, in an effort to show that style has the power to push boundaries and have global impact. She won a Shorty Award in 2018 for her &quot;Wear Nigerian&quot; campaign, and in 2019 was selected as one of 15 women to appear on the cover of the issue of &quot;British Vogue&quot; in an issue guest-edited by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

In a 2021 discussion at Düsseldorfer Schauspielhaus, Adichie spoke with the former Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel, and journalists Miriam Meckel and Léa Steinacker. They discussed that, for democracy to survive, people needed to preserve their traditions and history, be informed about intolerance and learn to accept diversity. Adichie said that she often uses fashion to educate people about diversity, and Merkel agreed that it could serve as a cultural bridge to bring people together globally.

===Religion===
Although Adichie was raised as a Catholic, she considers her views, especially those on feminism, to sometimes conflict with her religion. As sectarian tensions in Nigeria arose between Christians and Muslims in 2012, she urged leaders to preach messages of peace and togetherness. Adichie stated that her relationship to Catholicism is complicated because she identifies culturally as Catholic, but feels that the church&#x27;s focus on money and guilt do not align with her values. In a 2017 event at Georgetown University, she stated that differences in ideology between Catholic and Church Missionary Society leaders caused divisions in Nigerian society during her childhood, and she left the church around the time of the inauguration of Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. She acknowledged that the birth of her daughter and election of Pope Francis drew her back to the Catholic faith and spurred her decision to raise her child as Catholic. By 2021, Adichie stated that she was a nominal Catholic and only attended mass when she could find a progressive community focused on uplifting humanity. She clarified that &quot;I think of myself as agnostic and questioning&quot;. That year, her reflections on Pope Francis&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Fratelli tutti&quot; were published in Italian in the 5 July edition of the Vatican&#x27;s newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;. In her article, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Dreaming as a Single Humanity&quot;), Adichie recalled being berated at her mother&#x27;s funeral for having criticised the church&#x27;s focus on money, but she also acknowledged that Catholic rituals gave her solace during her mourning. She stated that Pope Francis&#x27; call in &quot;Fratelli tutti&quot; for recognition of everyone as part of the human family and for their responsibility to care for each other allowed her to re-imagine what the church might be.

===LGBTIA+ rights===
Adichie is an activist and supporter of LGBT rights in Africa and has been vocal in her support for LGBT rights in Nigeria. She has questioned whether consensual homosexual conduct between adults rises to the standard of a crime, as crime requires a victim and harm to society. When Nigeria passed an anti-homosexuality bill in 2014, she was among the Nigerian writers who objected to the law, calling it unconstitutional, unjust and &quot;a strange priority to a country with so many real problems&quot;. She stated that adults expressing affection for each other did not cause harm to society, but that the law would &quot;lead to crimes of violence&quot;. Adichie was close friends with Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina, whom she credited with demystifying and humanising homosexuality when he publicly came out in 2014. Writer Bernard Dayo said that Adichie&#x27;s eulogy to Wainaina in 2019 perfectly captured the spirit of the &quot;bold LGBTQ activist [of] the African literary world where homosexuality is still treated as a fringe concept.&quot;

Since 2017, Adichie has been repeatedly accused of transphobia, initially for saying that &quot;my feeling is trans women are trans women&quot; in an interview aired on Channel 4 in Britain. She apologised, and acknowledged that trans women need support and that they have experienced severe oppression, but she also stated that transgender women and other women&#x27;s experiences are different, and one could acknowledge those differences without invalidating or diminishing either group&#x27;s lived experience. After the apology, Adichie attempted to clarify her statement, by stressing that girls are socialised in ways that damage their self-worth, which has a lasting impact throughout their lives, whereas boys benefit from the advantages of male privilege, before transitioning. Some accepted her apology, and others rejected it as a trans-exclusionary radical feminist view that biological sex determines gender.

The controversy emerged again in 2020 when Adichie voiced support for J. K. Rowling&#x27;s article on gender and sex, in an interview in the British newspaper, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, calling the essay &quot;perfectly reasonable&quot;. That interview sparked a Twitter backlash from critics of her opinion, which included a former graduate of one of Adichie&#x27;s writing workshops, Akwaeke Emezi. In response, Adichie penned &quot;It Is Obscene: A True Reflection in Three Parts&quot; and posted it on her website in June 2021, criticising the use of social media to air out grievances. The following month, students who were members of the LGBT community at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, boycotted her public lecture on their campus. Adichie admitted in an interview with Otosirieze Obi-Young in September that she was &quot;deeply hurt&quot; by the backlash and began a period of self-reflection on her biases, informed by reading anything she could find to help her understand trans issues.

In late 2022, she faced further criticism for her views after another interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; when she said, &quot;So somebody who looks like my brother—he says, &#x27;I&#x27;m a woman&#x27;, and walks into the women&#x27;s bathroom, and a woman goes, &#x27;You&#x27;re not supposed to be here&#x27;, and she&#x27;s transphobic?&quot; The interview, according to the LGBT magazine &quot;PinkNews&quot; shows that Adichie &quot;remains insensitive to the nuances or sensitivities of the ongoing fight for trans rights&quot; and thus, criticised her for perpetuating &quot;harmful rhetoric about trans people&quot;. Cheryl Stobie of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, said that Adichie supported an &quot;exclusionary conceptualisation of gender&quot;. B. Camminga, a postdoctoral fellow at the African Centre for Migration &amp; Society at the University of the Witwatersrand stated that Adichie&#x27;s fame led to her comments on trans women being elevated and the voices of other African women, both trans and cis, being silenced. According to Camminga, Adichie disregarded her own advice in &quot;The Danger of a Single Story&quot; by telling a &quot;single story of trans existence&quot;.

==Public speaking==

In 2009, Adichie delivered a TED Talk titled &quot;The Danger of a Single Story&quot;. In the talk, Adichie expressed her concern that accepting one version of a story perpetrates myths and stereotypes because it fails to recognise the complexities of human life and situations. She argued that under-representation of the layers that make up a person&#x27;s identity or culture deprives them of their humanity. Adichie has continued to reuse the message drawn from the talk in her subsequent speeches, including her address at the Hilton Humanitarian Symposium of the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation in 2019. On 15 March 2012, Adichie became the youngest person to deliver a Commonwealth Lecture. The presentation was given at the Guildhall in London addressing the theme &quot;Connecting Cultures&quot;. Adichie said, &quot;Realistic fiction is not merely the recording of the real, as it were, it is more than that, it seeks to infuse the real with meaning. As events unfold, we do not always know what they mean. But in telling the story of what happened, meaning emerges and we are able to make connections with emotive significance.&quot; She stated that literature could build bridges between cultures because it united the imaginations of all who read the same books.

Adichie accepted an invitation to speak in London in 2012, at TEDxEuston, because a series of talks focusing on African affairs was being organised by her brother Chuks, who worked in the technology and information development department there, and she wanted to help him. In her presentation, &quot;We Should All Be Feminists&quot;, Adichie stressed the importance of reclaiming the word &quot;feminist&quot; to combat the negative connotations previously associated with it. She said that feminism should be about exploring the intersections of oppression, such as how class, race, gender and sexuality influence equal opportunities and human rights, causing global gender gaps in education, pay and power. In 2015, Adichie returned to the theme of feminism at the commencement address for Wellesley College and reminded students that they should not allow their ideologies to exclude other ideas and should &quot;minister to the world in a way that can change it. Minister radically in a real, active, practical, &#x27;get your hands dirty&#x27; way&quot;. She has spoken at many commencement ceremonies, including at Williams College (2017), Harvard University (2018), and the American University (2019). Adichie was the first African to speak at Yale University&#x27;s Class Day, giving a lecture in 2019 that encouraged students to be open to new experiences and ideas and &quot;find a way to marry idealism and pragmatism because there are complicated shades of grey everywhere&quot;.

Adichie co-curated the 2015 Pen World Voices Festival in New York City, along with Laszlo Jakab Orsos.i The festival theme was contemporary literature of Africa and its diaspora. She closed the conference with her Arthur Miller Freedom to Write lecture, which focused on censorship and using one&#x27;s voice to speak out against injustices. In addressing her audience, she pointed out cultural differences between Nigeria and America, such as the code of silence, which, in the United States, often acts as censorship. She stated that molding a story to fit an existing narrative, such as characterising the Boko Haram&#x27;s kidnapping of schoolgirls as equal to the Taliban&#x27;s treatment of women, is a form of censorship which hides the truth that Boko Haram opposes western-style education for anyone. Although she did not speak of her father&#x27;s recent kidnapping and release, writer Nicole Lee of &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that the crowd was aware of her personal ordeal, which made her speech &quot;all the more poignant&quot;.

In 2016, Adichie was invited to speak about her thoughts on Donald Trump&#x27;s election to the US Presidency for the BBC&#x27;s program &quot;Newsnight&quot;. When she arrived at the studio, she was informed that the format would be a debate between her and R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., a Trump supporter and the editor-in-chief of &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, a conservative magazine. Tempted to walk out of the interview, Adichie decided to continue because she wanted to discuss her views on how economic disenfranchisement had led to Trump&#x27;s victory. The debate turned adversarial when Tyrrell said &quot;I do not respond emotionally like this lady&quot;, and then declared that &quot;Trump hasn&#x27;t been a racist&quot;. Adichie countered his statements and gave an example citing Trump&#x27;s statement that Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel could not be impartial in the case &quot;Low v. Trump University&quot; because of his Mexican heritage. After the debate, she wrote on her Facebook that she felt ambushed by the BBC and that they had &quot;sneakily [pitted her] against a Trump supporter&quot; to create adversarial entertainment. In response, the BBC issued an apology for not informing her of the nature of the interview, but claimed they had designed the program to offer a balanced perspective.

Adichie delivered the second annual Eudora Welty Lecture on 8 November 2017 at the Lincoln Theatre in Washington, D.C. The lecture was presented to a sold-out crowd and focused on her development as a writer. That year, she also spoke at the Foreign Affairs Symposium held at Johns Hopkins University. Her talk focused on the fragility of optimism in the face of the current political climate. Adichie and Hillary Clinton delivered the 2018 PEN World Voices Festival, Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture at Cooper Union in Manhattan. Although the speech was centered on feminism and censorship, Adichie&#x27;s questioning of why Clinton&#x27;s Twitter profile began with &quot;wife&quot; instead of her own accomplishments became the focus of media attention, prompting Clinton to change her Twitter bio. Later that year, she spoke at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany about breaking the cycles which silence women&#x27;s voices. She stated that studies had shown that women read literature created by men and women, but men primarily read works by other men. She urged men to begin to read women writers&#x27; works to gain an understanding and be able to acknowledge women&#x27;s struggles in society. In 2019, as part of the Chancellor&#x27;s Lecture Series, she gave the speech &quot;Writer, Thinker, Feminist: Vignettes from Life&quot; at Vanderbilt University&#x27;s Langford Auditorium. The speech focused on her development as a storyteller, and her motives for addressing systemic inequalities to create a more inclusive world.

Adichie has been the keynote speaker at numerous global conferences. In 2018, she spoke at the seventh annual International Igbo Conference, and encouraged the audience to preserve their culture and fight misconceptions and inaccuracies about Igbo heritage. She revealed in her presentation &quot;&quot; (&quot;Igbo Is Igbo&quot;) that she only speaks to her daughter in Igbo, which was the only language her daughter spoke at the age of two. Speaking at the inaugural Gabriel García Márquez Lecture in Cartagena, Colombia in 2019, Adichie addressed violence in the country and urged leaders to focus on educating citizens from childhood to reject violence and sexual exploitation and end violent behaviors. Her speech was given in the Nelson Mandela barrio, one of the poorest neighborhoods of the city, and she encouraged Black women to work with men to change the violent culture and celebrate their African roots. Her keynote address at the 2020 (Future Conference) in Santiago, Chile, focused on the importance of listening. She said that, to become an effective advocate, a person must understand a wide variety of perspectives. She stressed that people become better problem solvers if they learn to listen to people with whom they may not agree, because other points of view help everyone recognise their common humanity. She was the keynote speaker of the 2021 Reykjavik International Literature Festival held in the cinema at the University of Iceland, and presented the talk &quot;In Pursuit of Joy: On Storytelling, Feminism, and Changing My Mind.&quot; On 30 November 2022, Adichie delivered the first of the BBC&#x27;s 2022 Reith Lectures, inspired by Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Four Freedoms&quot; speech. Her talk explored how to balance the right to freedom of speech against those who undermine facts with partisan messaging.

===Influence===
Larissa MacFarquhar of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; stated that Adichie is &quot;regarded as one of the most vital and original novelists of her generation&quot;. Her works have been translated into more than 30 languages. Obi-Young Otosirieze pointed out in his cover story about Adichie for the Nigerian magazine &quot;Open Country Mag&quot; in September 2021, that &quot;her novels ... broke down a wall in publishing. &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; proved that there was an international market for African realist fiction post-Achebe [and] &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; showed that that market could care about African histories&quot;. In an earlier article published in &quot;Brittle Paper&quot;, he stated that &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot;″s paperback release in 2006 sold 500,000 copies, the benchmark of commercial success for a book, by October 2009 in the UK alone. Her novel &quot;Americanah&quot; sold 500,000 copies in the US within two years of its 2013 release. , &quot;The Danger of a Single Story&quot; had received more than 27 million views. As of 1 September 2023, the talk is one of the top 25 most viewed TED Talks of all time.

According to Lisa Allardice, a journalist writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Adichie became the &quot;poster girl for modern feminism after her 2012 TED Talk &#x27;We Should All Be Feminists&#x27; went stratospheric and was distributed in book form to every 16-year-old in Sweden&quot;. Adichie has become &quot;a global feminist icon&quot; and a recognised &quot;public thinker&quot; per journalist Lauren Alix Brown. Parts of Adichie&#x27;s TEDx Talk were sampled in the song &quot;Flawless&quot; by singer Beyoncé on 13 December 2013. When asked in an NPR interview about that, Adichie responded that &quot;anything that gets young people talking about feminism is a very good thing.&quot; She later refined the statement in an interview with the Dutch newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot;, saying that she liked and admired Beyoncé and gave permission to use her text because the singer &quot;reached many people who would otherwise probably never have heard the word feminism.&quot; But, she went on to state that the sampling caused a media frenzy with requests from newspapers world-wide who were keen to report on her new-found fame because of Beyoncé. Adichie said, &quot;I am a writer and I have been for some time and I refuse to perform in this charade that is now apparently expected of me&quot;. She was disappointed by the media portrayal, but acknowledged that &quot;Thanks to Beyoncé, my life will never be the same again.&quot; Adichie was outspoken against critics who later questioned the singer&#x27;s credentials as a feminist because she uses her sexuality to &quot;pander to the male gaze&quot;. In defence of Beyoncé, Adichie said: &quot;Whoever says they&#x27;re feminist is bloody feminist.&quot;

Scholar Matthew Lecznar said that Adichie&#x27;s stature as &quot;one of most prominent writers and feminists of the age&quot; allowed her to use her celebrity &quot;to demonstrate the power of dress and empower people from diverse contexts to embrace [fashion] ... which has everything to do with the politics of identity&quot;. Academics Floriana Bernardi and Enrica Picarelli credited her support of the Nigerian fashion industry with helping put Nigeria &quot;at the forefront&quot; of the movement to use fashion as a globally-recognised political mechanism of empowerment. Toyin Falola, a professor of history, in an evaluation of scholarship in Nigeria, criticised the policy of elevating academic figures prematurely. He argued that scholarship, particularly in the humanities, should challenge policies and processes to strengthen the social contract between citizens and government. He suggested that the focus should shift from recognising scholars who merely influenced other scholars to acknowledging intellectuals who use their talents to benefit the state and serve as mentors to Nigerian youth. Adichie was among those he felt qualified as &quot;intellectual heroes&quot;, who had &quot;push[ed] forward the boundaries of social change&quot;.

Adichie&#x27;s book &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; was adapted into a film of the same title directed by Biyi Bandele in 2013. In 2018, a painting of Adichie was included in a wall mural at the Municipal Sport Center in the Concepción barrio of Madrid, along with 14 other historically influential women. The 15 women were selected by members of the neighborhood to give a visible representation of the role of women in history and to serve as a symbol of equality. The neighborhood residents defeated a move by conservative politicians to remove the mural in 2021 through a petition drive of collected signatures.

Luke Ndidi Okolo, a lecturer a Nnamdi Azikiwe University said:

Adichie&#x27;s work has garnered significant critical acclaim and numerous awards. Book critics such as Daria Tunca wrote that Adichie&#x27;s work is considerably relevant and stated that she was a major voice in the Third Generation of Nigerian writers, while Izuu Nwankwọ called her invented Igbo naming scheme as an &quot;artform&quot;, which she has perfected in her works. He lauded her ability to insert Igbo language and meaning into an English-language text without disrupting the flow or distorting the storyline. In the judgement of Ernest Emenyonu, one of the most prominent scholars of Igbo literature, Adichie was &quot;the leading and most engaging voice of her era&quot; and he has described her as &quot;Africa&#x27;s preeminent storyteller&quot;. Toyin Falola, a professor of history, hailed her along other writers, as &quot;intellectual heroes&quot;. Her memoir, &quot;Notes On Grief&quot; was positively praised by &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; as &quot;an elegant, moving contribution to the literature of death and dying.&quot; Leslie Gray Streeter of &quot;The Independent&quot; said that Adichie&#x27;s view on grief &quot;puts a welcome, authentic voice to this most universal of emotions, which is also one of the most universally avoided.&quot; She has been widely recognised as &quot;the literary daughter of Chinua Achebe&quot;. Jane Shilling of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; called her &quot;one who makes storytelling seem as easy as birdsong&quot;.

Adichie has gained wide praise for her speeches and lectures. Journalist Shreya Ila Anasuya described Adichie&#x27;s public speaking as delightful and articulate, noting that her timing allowed sufficient pauses for the audience response, before she continued by distilling &quot;her wisdom into the simplest and most compassionate of telling&quot;. Critic Erica Wagner called Adichie a &quot;star&quot;, stating that she spoke with fluency and power, exuding authority and confidence. She called &quot;The Danger of a Single Story&quot; an &quot;accessible essay on how we might see the world through another&#x27;s eyes&quot;. Media and communications professor Erika M. Behrmann, who reviewed Adichie&#x27;s TEDxEuston Talk, &quot;We Should All Be Feminists&quot; praised her as a &quot;gifted storyteller&quot;, who was able to intimately connect with her audience. Behrmann stated that the talk used language that made it relatable to children and adults, giving a basic foundation for students to learn about feminist ideas and issues, as well as learning about how gender is socially constructed by culture. She also said that Adichie demonstrated that gender inequality is a global challenge, and offered solutions to combat disparities by focussing less on gender roles and more on developing skills based upon ability and interests. However, Behrmann criticised the lack of discussion in the talk on the intersectional aspects of peoples&#x27; identities and Adichie&#x27;s reliance on binary terms (boy/girl, man/woman, male/female), which left &quot;little room to imagine and explore how transgender and genderqueer&quot; people contribute to or are impacted by feminism. Emenyonu said that her &quot;talks, blogs, musings on social media, essays and commentaries, workshop mentoring for budding writers and lecture circuit discourses ... expand and define her mission as a writer&quot;. Scholar Grace Musila said Adiche&#x27;s brand encompasses her reputation as a writer, public figure, and fashionista, which expanded her reach and the legitimacy of her ideas far beyond academic circles.

==Awards and honours==
In 2002, Adichie was shortlisted for the Caine Prize for African Writing for her story, &quot;You in America&quot;. She also won the BBC World Service Short Story Competition for &quot;That Harmattan Morning&quot;, while her short story &quot;The American Embassy&quot; won the 2003 O. Henry Award and the David T. Wong International Short Story Prize from PEN International. Her book, &quot;Purple Hibiscus&quot; was well received with positive reviews from book critics. The book sold well and was awarded the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize for the Best Book (2005), Hurston-Wright Legacy Award, and shortlisted for the Orange Prize for Fiction (2004). &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; garnered acclaim including winning the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007, the International Nonino Prize (2009), and the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award. Her story collection, &quot;The Thing Around Your Neck&quot; was the runner-up to the Dayton Literary Peace Prize for 2010. One story from the book, &quot;Ceiling&quot; was included in &quot;The Best American Short Stories 2011&quot;. &quot;Americanah&quot; was listed among &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;10 Best Books of 2013&quot;, and won the National Book Critics Circle Award (2014), and the One City One Book (2017). Her book &quot;Dear Ijeawele&quot;, translated in French as won the Le Grand Prix de l&#x27;Héroïne Madame Figaro in the category of best non-fiction book in 2017.

Adichie was a finalist of the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction (2014). She won the Barnard Medal of Distinction (2016), and the W. E. B. Du Bois Medal (2022), the highest honour from Harvard University. She was listed in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s &quot;20 Under 40&quot; authors in 2010, and the Africa39 under 40 authors during the Hay Festival in 2014, She was listed in &quot;Time 100&quot; in 2015, and &quot;The Africa Report&quot;″s list of the &quot;100 Most Influential Africans&quot; in 2019. In 2018, she was selected as the winner of the PEN Pinter Prize, which recognises writers whose body of literary work uncovers truth through critical analysis of life and society. The award recipient chooses the winner of the companion prize, the Pinter International Writer of Courage Award, for which Adichie named Waleed Abulkhair, a Saudi Arabian lawyer and human rights activist. The Women&#x27;s Prize for Fiction, formerly known as the Orange Prize, selected 25 candidates for its Winner of Winners in honour of its 25th anniversary celebrations in 2020. The public chose Adichie for &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; for the award.

In 2017, Adichie was elected as one of 228 new members to be inducted into the 237th class of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, making her the second Nigerian to be given the honour after Wole Soyinka. As of March 2022, Adichie had received 16 honorary degrees from universities

President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari selected her to be honoured as a recipient of the Order of the Federal Republic in 2022, but Adichie rejected the national distinction. On 30 December 2022, Adichie was honored with the title of &quot;Odeluwa&quot;, a chieftaincy position, by her hometown of Abba in Anambra State, marking her the first woman to receive a chieftaincy title in Abba.

<text>Agostino Lanzillo (31 October 1886 – 3 March 1952) was an Italian revolutionary syndicalist leader who later became a member of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist movement.

==Early life==
Agostino Lanzillo was born in Reggio Calabria on 31 October 1886 to Salvatore and Giuseppina (Cosile) Lanzillo. Agostino attended primary school and secondary school in his hometown. He acquired a law degree from the University of Rome and wrote his thesis on the socialist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon.

==Political career==

===Revolutionary syndicalist period===
Lanzillo was drawn to revolutionary syndicalism and became a follower of Georges Sorel. Lanzillo wrote: 

Lanzillo corresponded personally with Sorel, and published in 1910 the first biography of Sorel. Lanzillo also contributed to the syndicalist journals &quot;Avanguardia Socialista&quot; and &quot;Il divenire sociale&quot;.

===National syndicalist period===
In 1909, Georges Sorel started collaborating with the French nationalist-monarchist movement &quot;Action Française&quot;, creating national syndicalism. While many in the Italian Left attacked Sorel and reproached him for his close links with &quot;Action Française&quot;, Italian revolutionary syndicalists supported Sorel. Lanzillo, for example, defended his master in a series of articles published in &quot;Il divenire sociale&quot;. Later, Lanzillo wrote to the national syndicalist journal &quot;La lupa&quot;. From 1912, Lanzillo published under Benito Mussolini editorship, contributing to &quot;Avanti!&quot;, &quot;Utopia&quot; and &quot;Il Popolo d&#x27;Italia&quot;.

===Fascist period===
Lanzillo was among the founders of the fascist movement, and was a member of National Fascist Party.

Lanzillo was a member of Italian Chamber of Deputies (a house of Italian Parliament), in the 27th parliamentary session (24 May 1924 – 21 January 1929).

Lanzillo was also a member of the one-party National Council of Corporations in 1931.

==Academic career==
In 1921 Lanzillo was a lecturer in political economy at University of Rome. In 1922 he became a professor of political economy at the Royal University of Milan and in 1923 he became a professor at the University of Cagliari. Later, Lanzillo was appointed rector of Royal Advanced Institute of Economics and Commerce in Venice.
