<doc id="615491" wikidata="Q743668" url="?curid=615491" title="Timeline of scientific discoveries">
<text>of possible major scientific breakthroughs, theories and discoveries, along with the discoverer. This mere speculas discovery, although imperfect reasoned arguments, argbased on elegasimplicity, and numerically/experimentally verified conjectures qualify (as otherwise no scientific discovery before the late 19th century would count). The timeline begins at the Bronze Age, as it is difficult to give even estimates for the timing of events prior to this, such as of the discovery of counting, natural numbers and arithmetic.

To avoid overlap with timeline of historic inventions, the timeline does not list examples of documentation for manufactured substances and devices unless they reveal a more fundamental leap in the theoretical ideas in a field.

== Bronze Age ==
Many early innovations of the Bronze Age were prompted by the increase in trade, and this also applies to the scientific advances of this period. For context, the major civilizations of this period are Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley, with Greece rising in importance towards the end of the third millennium BC. The Indus Valley script remains undeciphered and there are very little surviving fragments of its writing, thus any inference about scientific discoveries in that region must be made based only on archaeological digs. The following dates are approximations.

Mathematics and astronomy flourish during the Golden Age of India (4th to 6th centuries AD) under the Gupta Empire. Meanwhile, Greece and its colonies have entered the Roman period in the last few decades of the preceding millennium, and Greek science is negatively impacted by the Fall of the Western Roman Empire and the economic decline that follows.

*1st to 4th century: A precursor to long division, known as &quot;galley division&quot; is developed at some point. Its discovery is generally believed to have originated in India around the 4th century AD, although Singaporean mathematician Lam Lay Yong claims that the method is found in the Chinese text &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, from the 1st century AD.
*60 AD: Heron&#x27;s formula is discovered by Hero of Alexandria.

*150: Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest contains practical formulae to calculate latitudes and day lengths.
*3rd century: Diophantus discusses linear diophantine equations.
*3rd century: Diophantus uses a primitive form of algebraic symbolism, which is quickly forgotten.

*By the 4th century: The present Hindu–Arabic numeral system with place-value numerals develops in Gupta-era India, and is attested in the Bakhshali Manuscript of Gandhara. The superiority of the system over existing place-value and sign-value systems arises from its treatment of zero as an ordinary numeral.
*4th to 5th centuries: The modern fundamental trigonometric functions, sine and cosine, are described in the Siddhantas of India. This formulation of trigonometry is an improvement over the earlier Greek functions, in that it lends itself more seamlessly to polar co-ordinates and the later complex interpretation of the trigonometric functions.
*By the 5th century: The decimal separator is developed in India, as recorded in al-Uqlidisi&#x27;s later commentary on Indian mathematics.
*By the 5th century: The elliptical orbits of planets are discovered in India by at least the time of Aryabhata, and are used for the calculations of orbital periods and eclipse timings.

* 499: Aryabhata develops an algorithm to solve the Chinese remainder theorem.
* 499: Historians speculate that Aryabhata may have used an underlying heliocentric model for his astronomical calculations, which would make it the first computational heliocentric model in history (as opposed to Aristarchus&#x27;s model in form). This claim is based on his description of the planetary period about the Sun (&quot;śīghrocca&quot;), but has been met with criticism.
* 499: Aryabhata creates a particularly accurate eclipse chart. As an example of its accuracy, 18th century scientist Guillaume Le Gentil, during a visit to Pondicherry, India, found the Indian computations (based on Aryabhata&#x27;s computational paradigm) of the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 to be short by 41 seconds, whereas his charts (by Tobias Mayer, 1752) were long by 68 seconds.

<doc id="615499" wikidata="Q59627745" url="?curid=615499" title="Phenylpropanolamine">
<text>Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), sold under many brand names, is a sympathomimetic agent used as a decongestant and appetite suppressant. It was once common in prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold preparations. The medication is taken orally.
Side effects of phenylpropanolamine include increased heart rate and blood pressure. Rarely, PPA has been associated with hemorrhagic stroke. PPA acts as a norepinephrine releasing agent, indirectly activating adrenergic receptors. As such, it is an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. It was once thought to act as a sympathomimetic with additional direct agonist action on adrenergic receptors, but this proved wrong. Chemically, phenylpropanolamine is a substituted amphetamine and is closely related to ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine, and cathinone. It is usually a racemic mixture of the (1&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;S&quot;)- and (1&quot;S&quot;,2&quot;R&quot;)-enantiomers of β-hydroxyamphetamine and is also known as &quot;dl&quot;-norephedrine.
Phenylpropanolamine was first synthesized around 1910 and its effects on blood pressure were characterized around 1930. It was introduced as medicine by the 1930s. It was withdrawn from many markets starting in 2000 after learning that it was associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke. It was previously available both over-the-counter and by prescription. Phenylpropanolamine is available for both human and/or veterinary use in some countries.

==Medical uses==
Phenylpropanolamine is used as a decongestant to treat nasal congestion. It has also been used to suppress appetite and promote weight loss in the treatment of obesity and has shown effectiveness for this indication.

===Available forms===
Phenylpropanolamine was previously available over-the-counter and in certain combination forms by prescription in the United States. However, these forms have all been discontinued. Phenylpropanolamine is available in some countries.

==Side effects==
Phenylpropanolamine produces sympathomimetic effects and can cause side effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. It has been associated rarely with incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.

Certain drugs increase the chances of &quot;déjà vu&quot; occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of &quot;déjà vu&quot;. The  reported the case of an otherwise healthy male who started experiencing intense and recurrent sensations of &quot;déjà vu&quot; upon taking the drugs amantadine and phenylpropanolamine together to relieve flu symptoms. He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the dopaminergic action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain, it was speculated that &quot;déjà vu&quot; occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.

==Interactions==
There has been very little research on drug interactions with phenylpropanolamine. In one study, phenylpropanolamine taken with caffeine was found to quadruple caffeine levels. In another study, phenylpropanolamine reduced theophylline clearance by 50%.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Phenylpropanolamine acts primarily as a selective norepinephrine releasing agent. It also acts as a dopamine releasing agent with around 10-fold lower potency. The stereoisomers of the drug have only weak or negligible affinity for α- and β-adrenergic receptors.

Phenylpropanolamine was originally thought to act as a direct agonist of adrenergic receptors and hence to act as a mixed acting sympathomimetic, However, phenylpropanolamine was subsequently found to show only weak or negligible affinity for these receptors and has been instead characterized as exclusively an indirectly acting sympathomimetic. It acts by inducing norepinephrine release and thereby indirectly activating adrenergic receptors.

Many sympathetic hormones and neurotransmitters are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and function generally in &quot;fight or flight&quot; type responses, such as increasing heart rate, blood pressure, dilating the pupils, increased energy, drying of mucous membranes, increased sweating, and a significant number of additional effects.

Phenylpropanolamine has relatively low potency as a sympathomimetic. It is about 100 to 200times less potent than epinephrine (adrenaline) or norepinephrine (noradrenaline) in its sympathomimetic effects, although responses are variable depending on tissue.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Absorption====
Phenylpropanolamine is readily- and well-absorbed with oral administration. Immediate-release forms of the drug reached peak levels about 1.5hours (range 1.0 to 2.3hours) following administration. Conversely, extended-release forms of phenylpropanolamine reach peak levels after 3.0 to 4.5hours. The pharmacokinetics of phenylpropanolamine are linear across an oral dose range of 25 to 100mg. Steady-state levels of phenylpropanolamine are achieved within 12hours when the drug is taken once every 4hours. There is 62% accumulation of phenylpropanolamine at steady state in terms of peak levels, whereas area-under-the-curve levels are not increased with steady state.

====Distribution====
The volume of distribution of phenylpropanolamine is 3.0 to 4.5L/kg. Levels of phenylpropanolamine in the brain are about 40% of those in the heart and 20% of those in the lungs. The hydroxyl group of phenylpropanolamine at the β carbon increases its hydrophilicity, reduces its permeation through the blood–brain barrier, and limits its central nervous system (CNS) effects. Hence, phenylpropanolamine crosses into the brain only to some extent, has only weak CNS effects, and most of its effects are peripheral. In any case, phenylpropanolamine can produce amphetamine-like psychostimulant effects at very high doses. Phenylpropanolamine is more lipophilic than structurally related sympathomimetics with hydroxyl groups on the phenyl ring like epinephrine (adrenaline) and phenylephrine and has greater brain permeability than these agents.

The plasma protein binding of phenylpropanolamine is approximately 20%. However, it has been said that no recent studies have substantiated this value.

====Metabolism====
Phenylpropanolamine is not substantially metabolized. It also does not undergo significant first-pass metabolism. Only about 3 to 4% of an oral dose of phenylpropanolamine is metabolized. Metabolites include hippuric acid (via oxidative deamination of the side chain) and 4-hydroxynorephedrine (via &quot;para&quot;-hydroxylation). The methyl group at the α carbon of phenylpropanolamine blocks metabolism by monoamine oxidases (MAOs). Phenylpropanolamine is also not a substrate of catechol &quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase. The hydroxyl group at the β carbon of phenylpropanolamine also helps to increase metabolic stability.

====Elimination====
Approximately 90% of a dose of phenylpropanolamine is excreted in the urine unchanged within 24hours. About 4% of excreted material is in the form of metabolites.

The elimination half-life of immediate-release phenylpropanolamine is about 4hours, with a range in different studies of 3.7 to 4.9hours. The half-life of extended-release phenylpropanolamine has ranged from 4.3 to 5.8hours.

The elimination of phenylpropanolamine is dependent on urinary pH. At a more acidic urinary pH, the elimination of phenylpropanolamine is accelerated and its half-life and duration are shortened, whereas at more basic urinary pH, the elimination of phenylpropanolamine is reduced and its half-life and duration are extended. Urinary acidifying agents like ascorbic acid and ammonium chloride can increase the excretion of and thereby reduce exposure to amphetamines including phenylpropanolamine, whereas urinary alkalinizing agents including antacids like sodium bicarbonate as well as acetazolamide can reduce the excretion of these agents and thereby increase exposure to them.

Total body clearance of phenylpropanolamine has been reported to be 0.546L/h/kg, while renal clearance was 0.432L/h/kg.

====Miscellaneous====
As phenylpropanolamine is not extensively metabolized, it would probably not be affected by hepatic impairment. Conversely, there is likely to be accumulation of phenylpropanolamine with renal impairment due to its dependence on urinary excretion.

Norephedrine is a minor metabolite of amphetamine and methamphetamine, as shown below. It is also a minor metabolite of ephedrine and a major metabolite of cathinone.

==Chemistry==
Phenylpropanolamine, also known as (1&quot;RS&quot;,2&quot;SR&quot;)-α-methyl-β-hydroxyphenethylamine or as (1&quot;RS&quot;,2&quot;SR&quot;)-β-hydroxyamphetamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. It is closely related to the cathinones (β-ketoamphetamines). β-Hydroxyamphetamine exists as four stereoisomers, which include &quot;d&quot;- (dextrorotatory) and &quot;l&quot;-norephedrine (levorotatory), and &quot;d&quot;- and &quot;l&quot;-norpseudoephedrine. &quot;d&quot;-Norpseudoephedrine is also known as cathine, and is found naturally in &quot;Catha edulis&quot; (khat). Pharmaceutical drug preparations of phenylpropanolamine have varied in their stereoisomer composition in different countries, which may explain differences in misuse and side effect profiles. In any case, racemic &quot;dl&quot;-norephedrine, or (1&quot;RS&quot;,2&quot;SR&quot;)-phenylpropanolamine, appears to be the most commonly used formulation of phenylpropanolamine pharmaceutically. Analogues of phenylpropanolamine include ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and cathinone.

Phenylpropanolamine, structurally, is in the substituted phenethylamine class, consisting of a cyclic benzene or phenyl group, a two carbon ethyl moiety, and a terminal nitrogen, hence the name &quot;phen-ethyl-amine&quot;. The methyl group on the alpha carbon (the first carbon before the nitrogen group) also makes this compound a member of the substituted amphetamine class. Ephedrine is the &quot;N&quot;-methyl analogue of phenylpropanolamine.

Exogenous compounds in this family are degraded too rapidly by monoamine oxidase to be active at all but the highest doses. However, the addition of the α-methyl group allows the compound to avoid metabolism and confer an effect. In general, &quot;N&quot;-methylation of primary amines increases their potency, whereas β-hydroxylation decreases CNS activity, but conveys more selectivity for adrenergic receptors.

Phenylpropanolamine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C9H13NO and a molecular weight of 151.21g/mol. It has an experimental log P of 0.67, while its predicted log P values range from 0.57 to 0.89. The compound is relatively lipophilic, but is also more hydrophilic than other amphetamines. The lipophilicity of amphetamines is closely related to their brain permeability. For comparison to phenylpropanolamine, the experimental log P of methamphetamine is 2.1, of amphetamine is 1.8, of ephedrine is 1.1, of pseudoephedrine is 0.7, of phenylephrine is -0.3, and of norepinephrine is -1.2. Methamphetamine has high brain permeability, whereas phenylephrine and norepinephrine are peripherally selective drugs. The optimal log P for brain permeation and central activity is about 2.1 (range 1.5–2.7).

Phenylpropanolamine has been used pharmaceutically exclusively as the hydrochloride salt.

==History==
Phenylpropanolamine was first synthesized in the early 20th century, in or around 1910. It was patented as a mydriatic in 1913. The pressor effects of phenylpropanolamine were characterized in the late 1920s and the 1930s. Phenylpropanolamine was first introduced for medical use by the 1930s.

In the United States, phenylpropanolamine is no longer sold due to an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke. In a few countries in Europe, however, it is still available either by prescription or sometimes over-the-counter. In Canada, it was withdrawn from the market on 31 May 2001. It was voluntarily withdrawn from the Australian market by July 2001. In India, human use of phenylpropanolamine and its formulations was banned on 10 February 2011, but the ban was overturned by the judiciary in September 2011.

==Society and culture==
===Names===
&quot;Phenylpropanolamine&quot; is the generic name of the drug and its , , and , while &quot;phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride&quot; is its and in the case of the hydrochloride salt. It is also known by the synonym &quot;norephedrine&quot;.

Brand names of phenylpropanolamine include Acutrim, Appedrine, Capton Diet, Control, Dexatrim, Emagrin Plus A.P., Glifentol, Kontexin, Merex, Monydrin, Mydriatine, Prolamine, Propadrine, Propagest, Recatol, Rinexin, Tinaroc, and Westrim, among many others. It has also been used in combinations under brand names including Allerest, Demazin, Dimetapp, and Sinarest, among others.

===Availability===
Phenylpropanolamine is available for medical and veterinary use in some countries.

===Exercise and sports===
There has been interest in phenylpropanolamine as a performance-enhancing drug in exercise and sports. However, clinical studies suggest that phenylpropanolamine is not effective in this regard. Phenylpropanolamine is not on the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) list of prohibited substances as of 2024.

===Legal status===
In Sweden, phenylpropanolamine is still available in prescription decongestants; Phenylpropanolamine is also still available in Germany. It is used in some polypill medications like Wick DayMed capsules.

In the United Kingdom, phenylpropanolamine was available in many &quot;all in one&quot; cough and cold medications which usually also feature paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) or another analgesic and caffeine and could also be purchased on its own. It is no longer approved for human use, however, and a European Category 1 Licence is required to purchase or acquire phenylpropanolamine for academic or research use.

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a public health advisory recommending against the use of the drug in November 2000. In this advisory, the FDA requested but did not require that all drug companies discontinue marketing products containing phenylpropanolamine. The agency estimates that phenylpropanolamine caused between 200 and 500 strokes per year among 18-to-49-year-old users. In 2005, the FDA removed phenylpropanolamine from over-the-counter sale and removed its &quot;generally recognized as safe and effective&quot; (GRASE) status. Under the 2020 CARES Act, it requires FDA approval before it can be marketed again effectively banning the drug, even as a prescription.

Because of its potential use in amphetamine manufacture, phenylpropanolamine is controlled by the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005. However, It is still available for veterinary use in dogs as a treatment for urinary incontinence.

Internationally, an item on the agenda of the 2000 Commission on Narcotic Drugs session called for including the stereoisomer norephedrine in Table I of United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

Drugs containing phenylpropanolamine were banned in India on 27 January 2011. On 13 September 2011, Madras High Court revoked a ban on the manufacture and sale of pediatric drugs phenylpropanolamine and nimesulide.

==Veterinary use==
Phenylpropanolamine is available for use in veterinary medicine. It is used to control urinary incontinence in dogs.

In June 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets for the control of urinary incontinence due to a weakening of the muscles that control urination (urethral sphincter hypotonus) in dogs. This is the first generic phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets for dogs.

Urinary incontinence happens when a dog loses its ability to control when it urinates. Urinary incontinence due to urethral sphincter hypotonus can happen as dogs age and as the dog’s muscle in its urethra (the tube that leads from the dog’s bladder to outside its body) weakens and loses control over its ability to hold urine.

Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets contain the same active ingredient (phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride) in the same concentration and dosage form as the approved brand name drug product, Proin chewable tablets, which were first approved in August 2011. In addition, the FDA determined that Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride chewable tablets contain no inactive ingredients that may significantly affect the bioavailability of the active ingredient.

<text>Mama&#x27;s Family is an American sitcom television series starring Vicki Lawrence as Mama (Thelma Harper). The series is a spin-off of a recurring series of comedy sketches called &quot;The Family&quot; featured on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1967–78) and &quot;Carol Burnett &amp; Company&quot; (1979). The sketches led to the television film &quot;Eunice&quot;, and finally the television series.

&quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; aired on NBC, debuting on January 22, 1983. After several timeslot changes and a subsequent drop in ratings, the network cancelled the series; the final episode of this two-season NBC incarnation of the series aired on April 7, 1984. NBC broadcast reruns until September 1985, which unexpectedly performed well in ratings.

Two years after its cancellation, original series producer Joe Hamilton Productions (JHP) revived &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; for new episodes in first-run syndication on local stations across the United States. The reincarnation, distributed by Lorimar-Telepictures, premiered on September 27, 1986. The modified four-season series revival gained substantially higher ratings than its first incarnation, eventually becoming the highest-rated sitcom in first-run syndication, with its final episode airing on February 24, 1990.

The show&#x27;s theme song is &quot;Bless My Happy Home&quot;, created as an &quot;a cappella&quot; by Lawrence. The show&#x27;s producers chose to use an instrumental of Lawrence&#x27;s song composed by Peter Matz. Disclosing the lyrics to the song as part of her &quot;Vicki and Mama: A Two Woman Show&quot; (untelevised stand-up comedy routine Lawrence has hosted as herself and Mama since 2001), Lawrence routinely performs the song in its original &quot;a cappella&quot; form. The lyrics were also featured in an advertisement for the show on MeTV.

==Overview==
The show is set in the city of Raytown, which actress Vicki Lawrence later revealed to be Raytown, Missouri, a suburb of Kansas City (although the script writing suggests the setting was Raytown, Mississippi, given the rural southern nature of the series). The television series revolves around the wacky misadventures of the Harper family, extended non-Harper family members and their neighbor friend in later seasons. Always at the center of all the trouble, turmoil and misunderstandings is head of the clan and matriarch Thelma Harper (Mama)—a thickset, gray-haired, purse-lipped, mid-to-late 60s widow who is portrayed as explosively quick-tempered, abrasive, and brash.

Mama&#x27;s snappy retorts and wisecracks are featured in a running gag in which the final scene of each episode cuts to an exterior shot of her residence (1027 Montrose Avenue in South Pasadena, which was also the house of Lynda&#x27;s character in the 1978 film &quot;Halloween&quot;. The home was only featured briefly in the film where Lynda walks toward the front door) while Mama&#x27;s voice is heard making a sharp or witty reply to whoever had previously spoken. This is then followed by audience laughter and applause. In spite of Thelma&#x27;s derogatory attitude, regular and sarcasm, she is nurturing and obliging at heart, allowing family members to live off her in her home who would otherwise have no place to live, while also regularly cooking for and cleaning up after them.

==Network run (seasons 1–2)==
===Beginning the series===
In the ninth season of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, producer Joe Hamilton wanted to spin off Mama into her own series, but Lawrence turned him down. She did not wish to wear a &quot;fat suit portraying an old lady every week&quot;, and she had misgivings about playing the role without Harvey Korman (who played Mama&#x27;s son-in-law, Ed Higgins) and Carol Burnett (who played Mama&#x27;s daughter Eunice Higgins) regularly by her side as in &quot;The Family&quot; sketches. Burnett and Korman told Lawrence that they would only appear as guest stars on the new series, and that it was Lawrence&#x27;s time to shine and take what she had learned from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and make it on her own. Shortly after the highly-rated &quot;Eunice&quot; TV movie, with continued urging by Korman and Burnett, Lawrence finally changed her mind and accepted the offer for her character&#x27;s own sitcom.

The writers had created Raytown to be its own &quot;cartoon-like&quot; world outside of reality. Although the series was sold to NBC without a pilot, the network had its own requirements, such as having &quot;normal&quot; teenagers as seen in other sitcoms of the time, which is how the Buzz and Sonja characters came about. However, Lawrence had a great deal of creative input and made many important decisions, including bringing in Korman very early on to co-direct the series. Lawrence objected to the original script of the episode &quot;Mama Cries Uncle&quot;, in which Thelma&#x27;s brother-in-law visits and the two supposedly wound up sleeping together:

According to her autobiography, Lawrence had a problem with the decision to tape the series on Stage 33 at CBS Television City, where &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; was produced.

===Plot details===
For 1½ seasons from 1983 through 1984, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; ran on NBC. In the series&#x27; first episode, Thelma Harper lives with her uncomfortable, uptight spinster sister Fran (Rue McClanahan), a journalist for a local paper. Thelma&#x27;s son Vinton (whose wife Mitzi had left him to become a cocktail waitress in Las Vegas) arrives to inform Thelma that he and his two children, Sonja and Buzz, have been evicted from their home and need a place to stay. Much to Fran&#x27;s chagrin, Thelma allows the trio to move in.

During the first season, Vinton forged a relationship with the Harpers&#x27; flirtatious next-door neighbor Naomi Oates, whom Thelma disliked, and soon married her. After selling Naomi&#x27;s house and losing the money in a bad business deal, Naomi and Vint are forced to move into Thelma&#x27;s basement, where they remain for most of the show&#x27;s run. Also seen on a recurring basis were Thelma&#x27;s two daughters: the snobbish Ellen (Betty White) and the ornery Eunice (Carol Burnett). Harvey Korman, who directed many of the earlier episodes, made featured appearances as Eunice&#x27;s husband, Ed Higgins. (During the eleventh and final season of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, the Ed Higgins character left Eunice and was written out of &quot;The Family&quot; skits.)

===Opening theme discrepancies===
Korman appeared at the beginning of each episode as the stuffed shirt Alistair Quince (a parody of Alistair Cooke), who would soberly introduce the program in the style of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. These monologs were cut out of the later syndicated reruns. Korman also performed the voice of Thelma&#x27;s unseen late husband, Carl, in flashback episodes.

An extended version of the show&#x27;s opening theme song, with repeated melodies, was used during the original NBC run, but was never used in reruns.

The house and neighborhood shown in the opening credits differed between the original NBC run and the syndicated run (1027 Montrose Avenue in South Pasadena, which was also the house of Lynda&#x27;s character in the 1978 film &quot;Halloween&quot;. The home was only featured briefly in the film where Lynda walks toward the front door), leading to discrepancies such as in the episode &quot;Mama for Mayor&quot;, in which Mama is shown in front of a house similar to the one used in the original opening theme of the first two seasons, though there are noticeable differences as it&#x27;s not the same house.

In 2013, StarVista Entertainment released the original NBC seasons with the Alistair Quince intros and original opening credits intact, except for two episodes in Season 1 (&quot;Cellmates&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Boyfriend&quot;), as the masters of those episodes are lost and were replaced by the syndicated version in the re-release.

===Cancellation===
While not a huge ratings success, the first season garnered solid enough numbers to justify being renewed for a second season. For instance, the premiere episode ranked #25 for the week with an 18.6 rating and a 28 share. However, during the second season, the show dropped out of the top 50 shows, losing share to CBS&#x27; hit &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot; As a result, NBC canceled the series in May 1984.

==First-run syndication (seasons 3–6)==
===Series rebirth===
After &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; was canceled by NBC in 1984, it was later relaunched in first-run syndication in 1986. Lorimar Television had just merged with Telepictures and were looking for new projects for the then newly commenced first-run syndication market. After observing high ratings for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; in summer reruns, production staff decided that the show deserved a second chance and ordered 100 episodes for syndication. Bubba, the son of Ed and Eunice, comes to live with Thelma after his parents move away.

===Absence of Carol Burnett as the &quot;Eunice&quot; character===
According to Lawrence&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Vicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball&quot;, Burnett resented Lawrence for accepting the role of Mama for first-run syndication with producer Joe Hamilton (who owned the &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; characters). It was during this time that Burnett was involved in an acrimonious divorce from Hamilton, who produced both &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;. Burnett felt Lawrence had been disloyal to her and held a grudge against her until Hamilton&#x27;s death in 1991. Sometime after Hamilton&#x27;s death, Burnett and Lawrence reconciled. Lawrence&#x27;s autobiography reads:

===Series end===
After &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; was picked up in first-run syndication, ratings for the series improved, becoming the highest-rated first-run program in syndication. According to Ken Berry, Lawrence had seemingly grown tired of playing the &quot;Mama&quot; role by 1990 and wanted to end the show. According to Lawrence, who would reprise Mama on stage for many years thereafter, the series ended because it had reached the standard threshold of 100 episodes, and the syndicator no longer needed to produce anymore, even though she would have wanted the show to continue.

==Cast==

===Thelma Mae Crowley &quot;Mama&quot; Harper ===

Thelma Harper, better known as Mama, is the title character of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; and the widowed matriarch of a rural Southern family. In February 2013, Lawrence stated that &quot;The Family&quot; sketch version of Mama was created by Dick Clair and Jenna McMahon who hated their mothers.
==Harper family tree==




*Magenta = Crowleys
*Orange = Harpers
*Blue = Harper children
*Red = Harper in-laws
*Green = Harper grandchildren
==Episodes==

Altogether, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; had six seasons consisting of 130 episodes. The show&#x27;s first life consisted of 35 episodes, making for two seasons. The show&#x27;s second life consisted of 95 episodes, making for four seasons.

===Favorites of Vicki Lawrence===
On September 30, 2013, Vicki Lawrence was asked what her favorite episodes of the series are:

* Lawrence answered that among the early seasons, her favorite is the episode &quot;The Wedding (Part 2).&quot; Her reason for favoring this episode is the big names featured in it. She listed Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Betty White, Ken Berry and Dorothy Lyman. In admiration, Lawrence remarked, &quot;How much help does one girl get?&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s just an amazing supporting cast. Dear God, Carol was funny in that show!&quot;
* Lawrence has described another favorite from the early seasons as the episode &quot;Rashomama,&quot; which is a takeoff on the Japanese film &quot;Rashomon&quot;. The episode is about Mama getting hit with a kettle in the kitchen and it is her, Betty, Dorothy, and Carol. At the emergency room, the three of them all have different versions of what happened to Mama. Lawrence explained, &quot;We redo the scene three different ways, and it&#x27;s pretty funny.&quot;
* As other episode favorites, Lawrence has named &quot;Family Feud&quot; and &quot;Mama on Jeopardy!&quot; Lawrence stated she loved having this dysfunctional family sent out into the real world. In particular, she enjoyed the inclusion of game shows because &quot;people know the format of these shows so perfectly, and to watch this crazy family get stuck in that format was really fun to me. Probably because I also love game shows so much.&quot;
* As another episode favorite, Lawrence named &quot;The Love Letter.&quot; Stated Lawrence, &quot;It was a great episode, a record-holder actually. I think Bubba writes a love letter for Vint, who is having some problems with Naomi. In the course of the 22-minute episode, everybody thinks that the love letter is meant for them. Mama thinks it is for her from the repair guy who is there. Iola is sure Vint has written it to her. The show actually ran 22 minutes with no costume changes or anything. I remember the night that we did it. We did it in 22 minutes and were out at 7:25, and our director said, &#x27;Good night, you&#x27;re done!&#x27;&quot; Lawrence added, &quot;Honestly, I have to say, by the time we finished the show, we had it down to a four-day workweek, so I kind of felt like we got paid to play dress up really.&quot;

==Ratings==
* Season 1: #59
* Season 2: #66

==Home media==

On September 26, 2006, Warner Bros. Television released season 1 of &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; on DVD. The DVD release features the syndicated versions of the episodes, which edits roughly three minutes from what originally aired. Warner Bros. claimed to only own the rights to the syndicated form.

Due to issues relating to ownership rights between the show&#x27;s production companies, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot; for a long time had difficulties coming out on DVD, with only its first season available for many years.

However, in May 2013, it was announced that StarVista Entertainment would release all 6 seasons of the sitcom to DVD, as well as a complete series box set, which was available only through the StarVista website. Most of the original unedited versions, dubbed &quot;The Joe Hamilton Cuts,&quot; were presented on DVD. Included with the package were extras of over 10 hours of bonus material, as well as a new cast reunion with Vicki Lawrence and the show&#x27;s syndicated cast members. In addition, StarVista offered a &quot;Signature&quot; collection of the entire series, autographed by Vicki Lawrence, which was limited to 500 copies.

In the fall of 2013, Star Vista began releasing individual season sets, Seasons 1 &amp; 2 were released on September 10, 2013, followed by season 3 on February 25, 2014. Season 4 was released on June 24, 2014, Season 5 on September 23, 2014 and the sixth and final season was released on February 10, 2015.
In conjunction with the complete seasons, Star Vista released a &quot;best-of&quot; single-disc unit for each season. Selected by Vicki Lawrence, each release has 6 (season 1 has 7) of her personal favorite episodes from each season.

<doc id="615505" wikidata="Q13700" url="?curid=615505" title="Lake Texcoco">
<text>Lake Texcoco (; ) was a natural lake within the &quot;Anahuac&quot; or Valley of Mexico. Lake Texcoco is best known for an island situated on the western side of the lake where the Mexica built the city of Mēxihco Tenōchtitlan, which would later become the capital of the Aztec Empire. After the Spanish conquest, efforts to control flooding led to most of the lake being drained. 

The entire lake basin is now almost completely occupied by Mexico City, the capital of the present-day nation of Mexico. Drainage of the lake has led to serious ecological and human consequences. The local climate and water availability have changed considerably, contributing to water scarcity in the area; subsequent groundwater extraction leads to land subsidence under much of the city. Native species endemic to the lake region, such as the axolotl, have become severely endangered or extinct due to ecosystem change. 

After the cancellation of Mexico City Texcoco Airport, the government initiated a major restoration project of a significant part of the lake in the form of the Lake Texcoco Ecological Park, 14,000 hectares of public space and ecological restoration.

==Geography==
The Valley of Mexico is a basin with an average elevation of above mean sea level located in the southern highlands of Mexico&#x27;s central &quot;altiplano&quot;. Lake Texcoco formerly extended over a large portion of the southern half of the basin, where it was the largest of an interconnected chain of five major and several smaller lakes (the other main lakes being Lakes Xaltocan, Zumpango, Chalco, and Xochimilco). Much of the lake was fed from groundwater aquifers; fresh water poured in from Lake Chalco and Xochimilco&#x27;s freshwater springs, and the thermal springs of Zumpango and Xaltocan, as well as some in Texcoco itself, provided saline water. During periods of high water levels—typically after the May-to-October rainy seasons—the lakes were often joined as one body of water, at an average elevation of above mean sea level. In the drier winter months the lake system tended to separate into individual bodies of water, a flow that was mitigated by the construction of dikes and causeways in the Late Postclassic period (1200–1521 CE) of Mesoamerican chronology. Lake Texcoco was the lowest-lying of all the lakes, and occupied the minimum elevation in the valley so that water ultimately drained towards it. The Valley of Mexico is a closed or endorheic basin. Because there is no outflow, evapotranspiration is estimated to be 72–79% of precipitation.

==History==
Between the Pleistocene epoch and the last glacial period, the lake occupied the entire Mexico Valley. Lake Texcoco reached its maximum extent 11,000 years ago with a size of about and over deep. When the lake&#x27;s water level fell it created several paleo-lakes that would connect with each other from time to time. At the north in the modern community of San Miguel Tocuilla there is a great paleontological field, with a great amount of pleistocenic fauna. The Lake was primarily fed by snowmelt and rain runoff when the Mexico Valley had a temperate climate. Between 11,000 and 6,000 years ago, the climate naturally warmed and snowfall in central Mexico became less prevalent. This caused the water level of the lake to drop over the next several millennia. Remnants of the ancient shoreline that Lake Texcoco had from the last glacial period can be seen on some slopes of Mount Tlaloc as well as mountains west of Mexico City. The disarticulated remains of seven Columbian mammoths dated between 10,220 ± 75 and 12,615 ± 95 years (BP) were found, suggesting human presence. It is believed that the lake disappeared and re-formed at least 10 times in the last 30,000 years.

Agriculture around the lake began about 7,000 years ago, with humans following the patterns of periodic inundations of the lake.

Several villages appeared on the northeast side of the lake between 1700 and 1250 BC. By 1250 BC the identifying signs of the Tlatilco culture, including more complex settlements and a stratified social structure, are seen around the lake. By roughly 800 BC Cuicuilco had eclipsed the Tlatilco cultural centers and was the major power in the Valley of Mexico during the next 200 years when its famous conical pyramid was built. The Xitle volcano destroyed Cuicuilco around AD 30, a destruction that may have given rise to Teotihuacan.

After the fall of Teotihuacan, AD 600–800, several other city states appeared around the lake, including Xoloc, Azcapotzalco, Tlacopan, Coyohuacan, Culhuacán, Chimalpa, and Chimalhuacán – mainly from Toltec and Chichimeca influence. None of these predominated and they coexisted more or less in peace for several centuries. This time was described as a Golden age in Aztec chronicles. By the year 1300, however, the Tepanec from Azcapotzalco were beginning to dominate the area.

=== Tenochtitlan ===
According to a traditional story, the Mexica wandered in the deserts of modern Mexico for 100 years before they came to the thick forests of the place now called the Valley of Mexico.

Tenochtitlan was founded on an islet in the western part of the lake in the year 1325. Around it, the Aztecs created a large artificial island using a system similar to the creation of chinampas. To overcome the problems of drinking water, the Aztecs built a system of dams to separate the salty waters of the lake from the rain water of the effluents. It also permitted them to control the level of the lake. The city also had an inner system of channels that helped to control the water.

The Aztec ruler Ahuitzotl attempted to build an aqueduct that would take fresh water from the mainland to the lakes surrounding the Tenochtitlan city. The aqueduct failed, and the city suffered a major flood in 1502.

During Hernán Cortés&#x27;s siege of Tenochtitlan in 1521, the dams were destroyed, and never rebuilt, so flooding became a big problem for the new Mexico City built over Tenochtitlan.

Mexico City suffered from periodic floods; in 1604 the lake flooded the city, with an even more severe flood following in 1607. Under the direction of Enrico Martínez, a drain was built to control the level of the lake, but in 1629 another flood kept most of the city covered for five years. At that time, it was debated whether to relocate the city, but the Spanish authorities decided to keep the existing location.

Eventually the lake was drained by the channels and a tunnel to the Pánuco River, but even that could not stop floods, since by then most of the city was under the water table. The flooding could not be completely controlled until the twentieth century. In 1967, construction of the &quot;Drenaje Profundo&quot; (&quot;Deep Drainage System&quot;), a network of several hundred kilometers of tunnels, was done, at a depth between . The central tunnel has a diameter of and carries rain water out of the basin. The eastern discharge tunnel was inaugurated in 2019.

The ecological consequences of the draining were enormous. Parts of the valleys were turned semi-arid, and even today Mexico City suffers from lack of water. Due to overdrafting that is depleting the aquifer beneath the city, Mexico City is estimated to have sunk 10 meters (33 feet) in the last century. Furthermore, because soft lake sediments underlie most of Mexico City, the city has proven vulnerable to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, most notably in the 1985 earthquake when hundreds of buildings collapsed and thousands of people died.

The term &quot;Texcoco Lake&quot; now refers only to a big area surrounded by salt marshes east of Mexico City, which covers part of the ancient lake bed. Also there are small remnants of the lakes of Xochimilco, Chalco, and Zumpango.

Several species indigenous to the lake are now extinct or endangered (e.g. axolotls).

The modern Texcoco Lake has a high concentration of salts and its waters are evaporated for their processing. A Mexican company, &quot;Sosa Texcoco S.A.&quot; has an solar evaporator known as El Caracol.

Land reclamation of the lakebed was part of Mexico&#x27;s attempts at development in the twentieth century.

=== Wildlife ===
The lake is home to an endemic subspecies of Mexican garter snake called the Lake Chapala Garter Snake, the critically endangered axolotl, and at one point in time the extinct Slender-billed grackle.

<doc id="615506" wikidata="Q18944" url="?curid=615506" title="3200 Phaethon">
<text>3200 Phaethon (; previously sometimes spelled Phæton), provisionally designated , is an active Apollo asteroid with an orbit that brings it closer to the Sun than any other named asteroid (though there are numerous unnamed asteroids with smaller perihelia, such as ). For this reason, it was named after the Greek Hero, Phaëthon, son of the sun god Helios. It is in diameter and is the parent body of the Geminids meteor shower of mid-December. With an observation arc of 35+ years, it has a very well determined orbit. The 2017 Earth approach distance of about 10 million km was known with an accuracy of ±700 m.

== Discovery ==
Phaethon was the first asteroid to be discovered using images from a spacecraft. Simon F. Green and John K. Davies discovered it in images from October 11, 1983, while searching Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) data for moving objects. It was formally announced on October 14 in IAUC 3878 along with optical confirmation by Charles T. Kowal, who reported it to be asteroidal in appearance. Its provisional designation was , and it later received the numerical designation and name in 1985.

== Orbital characteristics ==

Phaethon is categorized as an Apollo asteroid, as its orbital semi-major axis is greater than that of the Earth&#x27;s at . It is also suspected to be a member of the Pallas family of asteroids.

Its most remarkable distinction is that it approaches the Sun closer than any other named asteroid: its perihelion is only — less than half of Mercury&#x27;s perihelial distance. It is a Mercury-, Venus-, Earth-, and Mars-crosser as a result of its high orbital eccentricity. The surface temperature at perihelion could reach around .

Phaethon is a possible candidate for detecting general relativistic and/or solar oblateness effects in its orbital motion due to the frequent close approaches to the Sun. The Apollo asteroids (155140) 2005 UD and (225416) 1999 YC share similar orbits with Phaethon, suggesting a possible common breakup origin.

=== Potentially hazardous asteroid ===
Phaethon is categorized as a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA), but that does not mean there is a near-term threat of an impact. It is a potentially hazardous asteroid merely as a result of its size (absolute magnitude ) and Earth minimum orbit intersection distance ). The Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (E-MOID) is , which is defined by the shortest distance between the orbit of Phaethon and the orbit of Earth. With a 30+ year observation arc, the orbit of Phaethon is very well understood with very small uncertainties. Close approaches of Phaethon are well constrained for the next 400 years.

== Physical characteristics ==

Phaethon is an asteroid with fairly unusual characteristics in that its orbit more closely resembles that of a comet than an asteroid; it has been referred to as a &quot;rock comet&quot;. In studies performed by NASA&#x27;s STEREO spacecraft in 2009 and 2012, rapid brightening and dust tail have been observed.
It is possible that the Sun&#x27;s heat is causing fractures similar to mudcracks in a dry lake bed. This occurs because Phaethon&#x27;s orbit takes it closer to the Sun than any other named asteroid (0.14 AU at perihelion) causing extreme heating and enough solar radiation pressure to push any separated pieces off the asteroid&#x27;s surface. Since its discovery, several other objects were found exhibiting mixed cometary and asteroidal features, such as 133P/Elst–Pizarro, leading to a new class of objects dubbed &quot;active asteroids&quot;.

In 2018, observations revealed that Phaethon was blue in color. This is extremely rare, as most asteroids tend to be grey or red. In 2020, polarimetric study revealed Phaethon has a surface with steep slopes covered by a mix of regolith with larger pebbles. Phaethon&#x27;s composition fits the notion of its cometary origin; it is classified as a F-type asteroid because it is composed of dark material or a B-type asteroid because of its blue color. In 2022 it was shown how Phaethon&#x27;s blue color and its rock-comet-like emission activity can be explained by the effects of the intense solar heating at perihelion causing sublimation of any darkish-red refractory organic, nano-phase iron (nFe0), and pyroxene materials on its surface.

Analysis of a mid-infrared spectral emissivity spectrum from the Spitzer Space Telescope showed Phaethon to be linked to the rare Yamato-type (CY) carbonaceous chondrites. Further analysis of this spectrum confirmed the presence of Mg-rich olivine, carbonates, and Fe-sulfides. These minerals decompose at the temperatures that Phaethon reaches at perihelion, resulting in outgassing, in a process called thermal decomposition. It is believed that this process leads to dust ejection and can explain the formation of the Geminid meteor stream.

== Meteor shower ==
Shortly after its discovery, Fred Whipple observed that the &quot;orbital elements of 1983 TB shown on IAUC 3879 are virtually coincident with the mean orbital elements of 19 Geminid meteors photographed with the super-Schmidt meteor cameras&quot;. In other words, Phaethon is the long-sought parent body of the Geminids meteor shower of mid-December.

== Planned flyby ==
DESTINY+ (Demonstration and Experiment of Space Technology for INterplanetary voYage Phaethon fLyby dUSt science) is a planned mission to fly by 3200 Phaethon, as well as various minor bodies originating from it. The spacecraft is being developed by the Japanese space agency JAXA and will demonstrate advanced technologies for future deep space exploration. DESTINY+ is planned to be launched no earlier than 2028.

== Close approaches ==
Phaethon approached to of Earth on December 10, 2007, and was detected by radar at Arecibo. When Phaethon came to perihelion in July 2009, it was found to be brighter than expected. During its approach, the STEREO-A spacecraft detected an unexpected brightening, roughly by a factor of two.

=== 2010 approach ===

=== 2017 approach ===
On December 16, 2017, at 23:00 UT, Phaethon passed from Earth (27 lunar distances). The Earth approach distance was known with a 3-sigma precision of ±700 m. This was the best opportunity to date for radar observations by Goldstone and Arecibo, with a resolution of .

The asteroid was bright enough to see in small telescopes, peaking at magnitude 10.8 between December 13–15 while dimming slightly to magnitude 11 on December 16 at closest approach. Arecibo made observations of Phaethon from December 15–19. It will not make an Earth approach closer than the 2017 passage until December 14, 2093, when it will pass from Earth.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;California Dreams&quot; was not well received critically. Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the series a grade of &quot;F&quot;, and stated that &quot;&quot;California Dreams&quot; can be accused of a lot of things, but originality isn’t one of them&quot;, and added that &quot;&quot;California Dreams&quot; producer Franco E. Bario (who is also behind &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;) may have good intentions, but it’s hard to imagine what they were.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Lynne Heffley considered the show nothing more than &quot;a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; clone set in an upscale beach town&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
==Cast reunion==
The main cast members from the first two seasons of &quot;California Dreams&quot; reunited on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; on March 4, 2010, and played the show&#x27;s theme song. The version they sang was a unique mash-up that featured both Heidi Noelle Lenhart and Jennie Kwan, who replaced Lenhart in Season 2. While present, Jay Anthony Franke was not a featured vocalist in the performance, given that he did not perform the singing voice of Jake Sommers. Aaron Jackson and Diana Uribe were not present.

<doc id="615528" wikidata="Q161265" url="?curid=615528" title="Asphodeloideae">
<text>Asphodeloideae is a subfamily of the monocot family Asphodelaceae in the order Asparagales. It has previously been treated as a separate family, Asphodelaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. The family Asphodelaceae has now been proposed to be a nomen conservandum, and the proposal has been recommended for ratification in 2017. In that case, Asphodelaceae will have priority over Xanthorrhoeaceae. This is reflected in the APG IV family lists.

The subfamily name is derived from the generic name of the type genus, &quot;Asphodelus&quot;. Members of this group can be found growing native in coastal Southern Africa, Central and Western Europe, the Mediterranean basin, Central Asia and Australia; one genus, &quot;Bulbinella&quot;, can additionally be found growing in New Zealand. The greatest diversity occurs in South Africa.

Several genera, notably &quot;Aloe&quot;, &quot;Asphodelus&quot;, &quot;Gasteria&quot;, &quot;Haworthia&quot; and &quot;Kniphofia&quot; are perhaps the best known of the family due to their use among plant collectors, botanists and horticulturists. Additional genera and hybrids are also known, including &quot;Aristaloe&quot;, &quot;Gasteraloe&quot; and &quot;Gonialoe&quot; (the latter formerly included the now-rehomed Aloe variegata, or partridge-breast aloe).

== Description ==

The Asphodeloideae are distinguished by a general presence of anthraquinones, simultaneous microsporogenesis, atypical ovules morphology, and the presence of an aril. Asphodeloideae also have a characteristic secondary growth by means of a secondary thickening meristem. This character, however, is also found in other taxa in the Asparagales, including Agavaceae, Iridaceae, and Xanthorrhoeoideae. It is confined to Asparagales among the monocots and is believed to have evolved independently in most families.

=== Aloin cells ===

The presence of aloin cells is a distinctive character of the Aloeae. These cells are present in all Aloeae, but are absent in most of the other genera within Asphodeloideae. A well-developed cap of thin-walled parenchyma cells occurs at the phloem pole of each vascular bundle. Chase posits that they are involved in secondary metabolite production, but Beaumont suggests that the cells act as a storage tissue for compounds synthesized in the surrounding layer of cells. The aloin cells are said to produce the characteristic thick exudate that is produced when the succulent leaf of aloe is severed. The aloin cells produce anthraquinone and chromone derivatives, which may be responsible for the medicinal attributes of &quot;Aloe&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

Lotsy (1911) placed a number of genera (&quot;Kniphofia&quot;, &quot;Notosceptrum&quot;, &quot;Chortolirion&quot; and &quot;Aloe&quot;) into a family, separate from Asphodelaceae, the Aloinaceae. Other taxonomists have subsequently circumscribed a tribe, Aloineae (or Aloeae) to include &quot;Gasteria&quot;, &quot;Haworthia&quot; and &quot;Aloe&quot;. Other taxonomic terms have included Aloaceae, Alooideae, Aloideae, Aloidea, Aloides, Aloinae and Aloeace, with the type genus &quot;Aloe&quot;.

=== Phylogeny of Asphodeloideae ===

There is agreement among many researchers that Asphodeloideae can be further divided into a monophyletic group comprising &quot;Aloe&quot; and its immediate relatives, and a nonmonophyletic group of the remaining genera. The monophyletic group can be treated as the tribe Aloeae within the subfamily Asphodeloideae by those adopting the broad APG IV system circumscription of the Asphodelaceae. (Alternatively, it may be treated as the subfamily Alooideae within a more narrowly circumscribed family Asphodelaceae.) Aloeae are mainly rosulated-leaf succulents, while the other genera are not succulent. The genera in Aloeae are centered in southern Africa, while the other genera have mainly a Eurasian distribution.

=== Aloeae ===

, Aloeae (or Alooideae s.s.) comprises &quot;Aloe&quot;, &quot;Aloiampelos&quot;, &quot;Aloidendron&quot;, &quot;Aristaloe&quot;, &quot;Astroloba&quot;, &quot;Gasteria&quot;, &quot;Gonialoe&quot;, &quot;Haworthia&quot;, &quot;Haworthiopsis&quot;, &quot;Kumara&quot; and &quot;Tulista&quot;. The genera within Alooideae have several morphological characters that can be distinguished in the field, namely the arrangement and type of leaf and inflorescence.

Evidence for monophyly of Aloeae is based on distinctive karyotype and characteristic leaf morphology. The &quot;Bulbine&quot; group has characteristics of Aloeae, but is not included in the group due to a lack of tubular flowers. &quot;Kniphofia&quot; is considered an outgroup of Aloeae since it has tubular flowers and a fusion of perianth segments, but it lacks succulent leaves.

== Selected list of genera ==

The genera listed below are those accepted by APWeb . Other treatments combine some of these genera into as few as seven.

* &quot;Aloe&quot; 
* &quot;Aloiampelos&quot; 
* &quot;Aloidendron&quot; 
* &quot;Aristaloe&quot; 
* &quot;Astroloba&quot; 
* &quot;Asphodeline&quot; 
* &quot;Asphodelus&quot; 
* &quot;Bulbine&quot; 
* &quot;Bulbinella&quot; 
* &quot;Chortolirion&quot; 
* &quot;Eremurus&quot; 
* &quot;Gasteria&quot; 
* &quot;Gonialoe&quot; 
* &quot;Haworthia&quot; 
* &quot;Haworthiopsis&quot; 
* &quot;Jodrellia&quot; 
* &quot;Kniphofia&quot; 
* &quot;Kumara&quot; 
* &quot;Trachyandra&quot; 
* &quot;Tulista&quot;

<text>The Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise is a Fairmont hotel on the eastern shore of Lake Louise, near Banff, Alberta. The original hotel was gradually developed at the turn of the 20th century by the Canadian Pacific Railway and was thus &quot;kin&quot; to its predecessors, the Banff Springs Hotel and the Château Frontenac. The original wooden Rattenbury Wing was destroyed by fire on July 3, 1924, and was replaced by the Barott Wing a year later. The Painter Wing, built in 1913, remains the oldest existing part of the hotel. The Mount Temple Wing, opened in 2004, is the most recent wing and features modern function facilities; these include the Mount Temple Ballroom.

==History==
The hotel was first conceived by the railway at the end of the 19th century, as a vacation destination to lure moneyed travellers into taking trains and heading west. By the time airplanes and automobiles had displaced the trains, it had gained sufficient renown to have a life of its own. In 1999, Canadian Pacific Hotels (a division of the Canadian Pacific Railway) acquired Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, and adopted the Fairmont name for all of its hotels, resulting in the Chateau Lake Louise being operated as a Fairmont hotel.

The natural areas around the hotel were incorporated into Banff National Park, which has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

Originally built to function only in summer, the hotel was winterized in 1982 and now offers all the regular ski resort fare during the winter months. In addition to the usual skiing, ice skating and snowboarding, there are sleigh rides, ice sculpture contests and snowshoe excursions.

The hotel is owned by Oxford Properties, the real estate arm of OMERS, and operated by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts of Toronto. 

The hotel holds seven dining options: Fairview, Lakeview Lounge, the Walliser Stube, the Guide&#x27;s Pantry (formerly the Chateau Deli), Louiza (formerly Poppy Brasserie), the Alpine Social (formerly the Glacier Saloon), and the seasonal Italian cuisine kitchen Lago (usually opened regularly during summer).

<doc id="615555" wikidata="Q7936621" url="?curid=615555" title="Visual routine">
<text>A visual routine is a means of extracting information from a visual scene. 

Shimon Ullman, in his studies on human visual cognition, proposed that the human visual system&#x27;s task of perceiving shape properties and spatial relations is split into two successive stages: an early &quot;bottom-up&quot; state during which base representations are generated from the visual input, and a later &quot;top-down&quot; stage during which high-level primitives dubbed &quot;visual routines&quot; extract the desired information from the base representations. In humans, the base representations generated during the bottom-up stage correspond to retinotopic maps (more than 15 of which exist in the cortex) for properties like color, edge orientation, speed of motion, and direction of motion. These base representations rely on fixed operations performed uniformly over the entire field of visual input, and do not make use of object-specific knowledge, task-specific knowledge, or other higher-level information.

The visual routines proposed by Ullman are high-level primitives which parse the structure of a scene, extracting spatial information from the base representations. These visual routines are composed of a sequence of elementary visual operators specific to the task at hand. Visual routines differ from the fixed operations of the base representations in that they are not applied uniformly over the entire visual field --- rather, they are only applied to objects or areas specified by the routines. 

Ullman lists the following as examples of visual operators: shifting the processing focus, indexing a salient item for further processing, spreading activation over an area delimited by boundaries, tracing boundaries, and marking a location or object for future reference. When combined into visual routines, these elementary operators can be used to perform relatively sophisticated spatial tasks such as counting the number of objects satisfying a certain property, or recognizing a complex shape. 

A number of researchers have implemented visual routines for processing camera images, to perform tasks like determining the object a human in the camera image is pointing at. Researchers have also applied the visual routines approach to artificial map representations, for playing real-time 2D video games. In those cases, however, the map of the video game was provided directly, alleviating the need to deal with real-world perceptual tasks like object recognition and occlusion compensation.

<doc id="615558" wikidata="Q6844309" url="?curid=615558" title="Migrant deaths along the Mexico–United States border">
<text>The United States border with Mexico is one of the world&#x27;s &quot;most lethal land borders&quot;. Hundreds of migrants die per year as they attempt to cross into the United States from Mexico illegally. The US Border Patrol reported 251 migrant deaths in the fiscal year 2015 (ending September 30, 2015), which was lower than any year during the period 2000–2014, and reported 247 migrant deaths in fiscal year 2020, lower than any year since 1998.
Poverty, gang violence, poor governance, etc. are the main factors as to why migrants cross the US border.
US Border Patrol recorded 557 southwest border deaths during fiscal year 2021 and 748 in the first 11 months of fiscal year 2022, the most deaths ever recorded.

Exposure (including heat stroke, dehydration, and hyperthermia) were the leading cause.

The group Border Angels estimates that since 1994, about 10,000 people have died in their attempt to cross the border. According to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 8,050 people have died crossing the U.S–Mexico border between 1998 and 2020. In 2005, more than 500 died across the entire U.S.–Mexico border. The number of yearly border crossing deaths doubled from 1995 to 2005, and has since declined and then risen. The statistics reflect only known deaths and do not include estimates for those who have never been found. Some migrant deaths may go unreported even when they are brought to the attention of officials.

Mexico&#x27;s Secretariat of Foreign Affairs has compiled data including deaths on the Mexican side of the border area during the period from 1994 to 2000. The data shows 87 deaths in 1996, 149 in 1997, 329 in 1998, 358 in 1999, and 499 in 2000.

U.S. Border Patrol reported that 3,417 migrants were rescued in the fiscal year 2017.

==Data for Arizona==

The &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot; maintained a database daily of border deaths recorded by the Pima, Santa Cruz, Cochise, and Yuma County medical examiners between summer 2004 and September 2006. They stated, &quot;With no official record-keeping system, the exact number of illegal entrants who have died along the Arizona stretch of U.S-Mexican border has never been known.&quot;

The number of dead border crossing migrants per year in Arizona increased from nine in 1990 to 201 in 2005; about 80% of the dead migrants were under 40 during 2000–2005, with an increasing number younger than 18.

==Trends==

A study by the Center for Immigration Research at the University of Houston found that, &quot;In the late 1980s, the number of foreign transient deaths usually exceeded 300, and peaked in 1988 at 355. Thereafter, the number of deaths fell to 180 in 1993 and 1994. After 1994 the number of deaths started to increase again, peaking in 2000 at 370. Border Patrol counts for 2001 and 2002 show a small decrease in the number of deaths in those years compared to 2000.&quot;

The number of deaths of illegal immigrants along the border has increased on a regular, yearly basis since the middle 1990s, particularly in the state of Arizona. As of summer 2006, tighter enforcement in Arizona has likely led to fewer deaths there, but border wide fatalities were approaching the record pace of 2005.

In 2012, the United States Border Patrol found the remains of 463 migrants in the U.S., of which 177 were discovered along the section of the border near Tucson, Arizona. The Rio Grande Valley of South Texas reported 150 migrant remains found, a jump from 2011 due to the increased numbers of Central American migrants.

An ethnographer by the name of Seth Holmes noted that there were 500 deaths in the Tucson region just in his second year of field studies. This shows how there was a high number of fatalities in a concentrated geographical area suggesting that the overall total along the U.S. Mexico border was higher.  

===Exposure===

Hyperthermia is one of the most common causes of migrant border deaths in the U.S. There was a sharp rise in the number of people dying from hypothermia and dehydration, from 1993 to 1997, as increased border enforcement diverted undocumented migration flows from urban crossing points to more remote areas where the risk of death was higher.

On July 23, 2017, 10 illegal immigrants died of exposure in a tractor-trailer discovered at a Wal-Mart in San Antonio.

On 25 June 2019, seven migrants including a woman and three children were found dead by U.S. Border Patrol Agents near the Rio Grande in South Texas. The death was reportedly due to heat exposure and dehydration. A 6-year-old Indian girl was also found dead in June 2019, from heat exposure in western Arizona who was abandoned along with a group of migrants by the smugglers in a remote desert location.

On June 27, 2022, 53 people were discovered dead in and around a tractor-trailer near Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. The deaths were reportedly caused by heat exhaustion and asphyxiation during an apparent illegal migrant smuggling attempt across the US-Mexico border. It is described as the deadliest trafficking incident in the history of the United States.

===Drowning===
A common cause of immigrant border deaths is drowning in canals, ditches, and the Rio Grande.

On January 14, 2024, a woman and two children drowned in the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas, as a result of a standoff between the Texas Military Forces and the U.S. Border Patrol. According to the Department of Homeland Security, border agents were made aware of a distress call from the Mexican government concerning a group of six, but were unable to assist them due to the Texas National Guard physically preventing them from doing so under the direction of Governor Greg Abbott.

===Accidents===
Significant numbers of undocumented immigrants die daily in car accidents and other accidental causes. According to a December 2006 cover story in the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot;, &quot;...traffic fatalities involving immigrants have more than doubled since 2003 as &quot;coyotes,&quot; or &quot;polleros&quot; – the guides leading migrants across the border – try other methods. On August 7, nine migrants died in a crash in the Yuma sector when the driver of a Chevrolet Suburban – in which 21 Mexicans were &#x27;stacked like cordwood&#x27; – lost control after crossing a Border Patrol spike strip at high speed. This year the number killed in traffic accidents during illegal crossings is about 50.&quot;

In January 2003, two undocumented immigrant passengers died when their truck crashed on Interstate 8 while fleeing the Border Patrol, after a spike strip punctured a tire. A week after the accident, a third person, Elvia Rumbo Leyva, died in the hospital.

Close to one hundred undocumented immigrants were struck and killed on San Diego County freeways over a five-year span in the late 1980s, prompting the creation of a highway safety sign to caution drivers about migrants crossing the road.

===Incidents of Border Patrol use of force===
According to Rodolfo Acuña, Professor Emeritus of Chicano Studies at California State University, &quot;Mexico&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported 117 cases of human rights abuses by US officials against migrants from 1988 to 1990, including fourteen deaths. During the 1980s, Border Patrol agents shot dozens of people, killing eleven and permanently disabling ten.&quot;

On May 28, 1994, Martín García Martínez was shot by a Border Patrol agent at the San Ysidro port of entry. He died on July 3 as a result of his injuries.

In May 2000, an illegal immigrant was shot in the shoulder by a border patrolman near Brownsville, Texas, and died later from the wounds.

In January 2006, an eight-year veteran of the Border Patrol, fearful of stones which were being thrown at him shot Guillermo Martinez Rodriguez, a known people smuggler who had been detained 11 times prior. Rodriguez, with a gunshot to the back of his right shoulder, crossed back to Mexico and was taken to the Red Cross in Tijuana where he died twenty-five and a half hours later from the injury. Under the Border Patrol&#x27;s use-of-force guidelines, agents are permitted to employ lethal force against rock throwers if they pose a threat.

In January 2007, border patrol agent Nicholas Corbett shot and killed Francisco Javier Domínguez Rivera after the latter tried to smash his head with a rock according to the officer&#x27;s lawyer. After the agent was acquitted of wrongdoing, a civil suit was filed on behalf of Rivera&#x27;s parents. This civil suit claimed that the United States government was responsible for wrongful death of Rivera due to the fact that the agent was performing his official duty. Mexico lodged an official protest with the United States over the death stating its &quot;firm condemnation&quot; and &quot;serious concern over the recurrence of this type of incident.&quot; The protest demanded an exhaustive investigation. Though the incident was recorded by surveillance cameras, the recording was not very clear.

On May 28, 2010, Anastasio Rojas, a 42-year-old Mexican migrant worker, was tased and beaten at the San Ysidro border crossing by more than a dozen Customs and Border Protection officers. Rojas&#x27; death was featured on the PBS News Magazine &quot;Need to Know&quot; in April 2012, in which several civilian eyewitnesses gave their testimony and provided two amateur videos of the event. According to the witnesses, he was facedown on the ground and handcuffed while he was being tased and beaten, all the while being surrounded by twelve officers. His pleas for help are clearly audible on the amateur footage. In the hours before Rojas&#x27; death, he had tried to file a complaint against a Border Patrol officer for kicking his injured ankle, that officer and another officer would later drive Rojas to the border alone at night, soon after Rojas sustained fatal injuries. Since the initial broadcast of &quot;Need to Know&quot;, 16 members of congress have demanded a justice department investigation into Anastasio Rojas&#x27; death while in Border Patrol&#x27;s custody, which is currently under way. He leaves behind a wife and five children.

In June 2010, a 15-year-old Mexican citizen was shot to death on the Mexican side of the border near El Paso, Texas. The U.S. Border Patrol reported that the officers responded to a group of suspected illegal immigrants who were throwing rocks at them. President Felipe Calderón criticized the shooting by stating that &quot;the use of firearms to repel attacks with stones represents disproportionate use of force&quot;.

According to the data collected from No More Deaths from 2012 to 2015, there was at least 3586 gallons of water destroyed in the 800 square mile desert located near Arivaca, Arizona. This implies the intent of indirectly dehydrating migrants cause by U.S. border patrol agents.

On 14 September 2018, US media reported that Jacklyn, a 7-year-old from Guatemala had died while in custody of US Customs. The girl&#x27;s family denied she did not have enough food to eat before she died.

===Vigilante killings===
According to &quot;Time&quot; Magazine, in the first half of 2000, three immigrants were killed and seven others wounded in showdowns on the U.S. side of the border.

In 2000, the United Nations opened an investigation into vigilante killings of migrants crossing Mexico&#x27;s border with the U.S., dispatching a senior UN investigator to the border country close to where Sam Blackwood, a 74-year-old rancher, was charged with killing Eusebio de Haro, an unarmed Mexican he tried to subdue for the border patrol and shot in the back of the thigh, causing him to bleed to death after pursuing him a quarter mile down the road in his truck.

===Intentional killings===
On February 8, 2007, four gunmen of unknown nationality opened fire on a truck carrying illegal immigrants in the Ironwood Forest National Monument, killing two men and a 15-year-old girl.

==Impact on border communities==

The impact of migrant deaths on border communities can be difficult for small towns on the U.S. side, which have found themselves with hundreds of remains to identify and bury, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars. In November 2013, the Office of the Medical Examiner in Pima County, Arizona, had 871 cases of unidentified remains dating as far back as the 1990s. Relief groups often aid migrants traveling along the border. A Mexican federal task force known as Grupos Betas protects migrants from crime while the migrants make the journey north. Other groups such as &#x27;No More Deaths&#x27; provide migrants with humanitarian assistance and members participate in &#x27;desert runs&#x27; to search for migrants in need of help.

==International consequences==

The deaths have caused tension between the United States and other countries, particularly Mexico and the countries of Central America, from where a majority of illegal immigrants who enter the United States through the Southwestern borders come. Foreign consulates across the Southwest United States, in particular those of Latin American countries, have condemned the deaths of illegal immigrants across the border.

<text>Sonic Nurse is the thirteenth studio album by American rock band Sonic Youth, released on June 8, 2004, by Geffen Records.

== Content ==
The album&#x27;s cover art was designed by artist Richard Prince from his &quot;Nurse Paintings&quot; series. Furthermore, one of Prince&#x27;s photographic creations in this series was titled &quot;Dude Ranch Nurse&quot;, which is also the name of a song on this record.

&quot;Pattern Recognition&quot; was based on the 2003 William Gibson novel of the same name. Sonic Youth had used Gibson&#x27;s work as an influence before, notably on a few tracks from &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; (1988).

&quot;Kim Gordon and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream&quot; was previously released as &quot;Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream&quot; on the first Narnack &quot;Buddy Series&quot; 7&quot;, but the title was changed over concerns of potential legal action from Carey&#x27;s legal team.

==Reception==

The album has a score of 77 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;No Ripcord&quot; gave the album 10 out of 10 stars and said it &quot;could be the best guitar rock album since, well, &quot;Murray Street&quot;.&quot; Drowned in Sound gave it 5 out of 5 stars and said the album was &quot;the closest to creating a landmark on parallel with &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; they&#x27;ve come since that particular record&#x27;s nameday in &#x27;88, and in dense textures it maybe signals the extinction of the antediluvian No Wave idyll; a Robert Zimmerman trip that somehow got mixed up with Joni Mitchell, Black Flag and a conceptualist oddball.&quot; In his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot;, Robert Christgau gave the album an A− and said, &quot;This unusually songful set is well up among their late good ones, its dissonances a lingua franca deployed less atmospherically than has been their recent practice.&quot; While working for &quot;Blender&quot;, Christgau gave the same album 4 stars out of 5 and called it &quot;[Sonic Youth&#x27;s] most songful release since the major-label hellos &quot;Goo&quot; and &quot;Dirty&quot;, and by most standards their best since 1988&#x27;s pivotal &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;.&quot; &quot;Filter&quot; gave the album a score of 90% and called it &quot;a gorgeous, bona fide gem.&quot; &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; gave it a B+ and said that the album, &quot;if not proof of a band bursting with fresh ideas, is at least fresh-sounding.&quot;

&quot;Prefix Magazine&quot; gave it a favorable review and said, &quot;With &quot;Sonic Nurse&quot;, it&#x27;s truly possible to see 2000&#x27;s excruciatingly indulgent &quot;NYC Ghosts and Flowers&quot; as a speed bump on an otherwise smooth decade of record-making. Their last, 2002&#x27;s bittersweet &quot;Murray Street&quot;, was a return to form, and the epic &quot;Sonic Nurse&quot; will only supply more evidence for Sonic Youth&#x27;s canonization&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it a score of 4 stars out of 5 and said, &quot;Every song but one falls fully developed in the five- to seven-minute ballpark, brimming with enough dissonant wizardry, smart vocal imagery, and tonal shades of rock to fly the freak flag like no aging rockers ever have&quot;. Yahoo! Music UK gave the album 8 stars out of 10 and said, &quot;What emerges is Sonic Youth at complete ease with themselves and their music, operating simultaneously at the peak of their powers and with a powerful, audacious restraint&quot;. &quot;Under the Radar&quot; also gave it 8 out of 10 stars and said the album &quot;might capture something of indie rock&#x27;s recent taste for emotional epics&quot;. &quot;Uncut&quot; likewise gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and stated: &quot;The Youth sound rejuvenated&quot;. &quot;Dusted Magazine&quot; gave it a favorable review and said that &quot;The songs, despite being mostly over five minutes long, are all to the point without feeling meandering... The balance between noise and melody is right, with each emerging and vanishing at just the right point&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; also gave it a favorable review and said the album &quot;compiles a laid-back hour of elaborate plucking and rhythm from five veteran musicians who reserve musical violence and poetic anger for when it feels most appropriate&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; likewise gave it a favorable review and said the album &quot;percolates the same melancholy satisfaction and nervous maturity, entropy and growth, in and out--but with an urgency and impulsiveness that risks upsetting the balance&quot;. E! Online gave the album a B and called it &quot;a cure for what ails the airwaves.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; gave it a score of 7 out of 10 and said the album &quot;sounds like a brilliant album by a lesser band&quot;.

&quot;Q&quot; gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said it &quot;finds [Sonic Youth] revelling in bursts of noise and awkwardness, but more surprisingly perhaps, taking as much comfort in sweet melody&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; also gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said it was not &quot;a classic rock record. And it&#x27;s not a classic Sonic Youth record. It&#x27;s an excursion, into corners weird and corners familiar&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; likewise gave the album 3 stars out of 5 and said it was &quot;better than 90 percent of new rock, but with younger combos like Lightning Bolt and Liars stealing their thunder, these well-meaning vets come off as old and in the way&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot;, however, gave it a score of 5 out of 10 and called it &quot;a strangely enervated Sonic Youth record, one that exchanges Murray Street&#x27;s golden-years vigor for a sad sense of duty&quot;.

The album placed second in &quot;The Wire&quot;″s annual critics&#x27; poll, where magazine staff wrote &quot;[t]here are of course those who think the prefects of the School of Rock can do this sort of thing in their sleep nowadays, but there was no arguing with the supple versatility of their triple guitar stack and the delight with which they marry lyrics astuteness, textural grit and forward momentum.&quot;

<text>Hatred () is a 1977 Soviet action adventure film directed by Samvel Gasparov.

==Plot==
This drama explores the way that war tears families apart.

&quot;Hatred&quot; is set in a small village in the Ukraine, in which dying man Bulgya tries to reconcile his three estranged sons, who have been scattered by the Russian Civil War. The elder son, Stepan served with the White Army, the middle son Fyodor served with the Red Army while the youngest, Mitka left home with no allegiances and no idea where to go. Contrary to Bulgya&#x27;s hopes, the reunion is a cool one.

When Bulgya dies, the brothers are drawn together. They bury their father and promptly leave the village. But as soon as they pass the gates, a band of horsemen in Red Army uniforms burst into the village, killing the villagers, and burning their homes. The brothers set off in pursuit without any idea of who they are chasing. They do not know if they are really Red Army officers or if they are White Guards in disguise. Eventually Stepan recognises a fellow soldier from the White Guards and realises his loyalties are divided. He tries to play both sides, first betraying his brothers to the White Guards, and then helping them to escape. Fyodor and Mitka take a White Colonel prisoner, and on his way from the estate, Stepan hears gunshots. Rushing off after them, he realises he has become a stranger to the Whites as well.

<doc id="615573" wikidata="Q2552587" url="?curid=615573" title="Waterloo Creek massacre">
<text>The Waterloo Creek massacre (also Slaughterhouse Creek massacre) refers to a series of violent clashes between mounted settlers, civilians and Indigenous Gamilaraay people, which occurred southwest of Moree, New South Wales, Australia, during December 1837 and January 1838.

The Waterloo Creek Massacre site is listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register as a place of significance in frontier violence leading to the murder of Gamilaraay people.

The events have been subject to much dispute, due to wildly conflicting accounts by various participants and in subsequent reports and historical analyses, about the nature and number of fatalities and the lawfulness of the actions. Interpretations were made again during the Australian history wars which began in the 1990s.

==Events==
A Sydney mounted police detachment was dispatched by acting Lieutenant Governor of New South Wales Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass, to track down the Namoi, Weraerai and Kamilaroi people who had killed five stockmen in separate incidents, on recently established pastoral runs on the upper Gwydir River area of New South Wales. After two months the mounted police, consisting of two sergeants and twenty troopers led by Major James Nunn, arrested 15 Aboriginals along the Namoi River. They released all but two, one of whom was shot whilst attempting to escape. The main body of Kamilaroi eluded the troopers, thus Major Nunn&#x27;s party, along with two stockmen, pursued the Kamilaroi for three weeks, from present-day Manilla on the Namoi River north to the upper Gwydir River. On the morning of 26 January, in a surprise attack on Nunn&#x27;s party, Corporal Hannan was wounded in the calf with a spear, where subsequently members of the Kamilaroi were killed. While one source puts the number of Kamilaroi fatalities at 4-5, there are other sources which say this number was closer to 40-50. The Aboriginals fled down the river as the troopers regrouped, rearmed and pursued them, led by the second-in-command, Lieutenant George Cobban. Cobban&#x27;s party found their quarry about a mile down the river at a point now known as Waterloo Creek, where a second engagement took place. The encounter lasted several hours and no Aboriginals were captured.

===Possibly disproportionate force===
As there had been no declaration of martial law or other authorising legislation, the police lacked authority to use more than reasonable force proportionate to any risk to the safety of persons or property. Nobody at all had a licence to kill.
The troopers may therefore have used disproportionate force on people who posed little or no risk. &quot;There was a suspicion that the troopers might have acted as an ill-disciplined military force rather than as a regular police force.&quot;

==Official inquiry==
On 5 March 1838, Nunn submitted a report on his expedition to the newly arrived Governor Gipps.

Within the following month the colony&#x27;s Executive Council (the Colonial government constituted by the Governor and his advisers) accepted a recommendation of the Attorney General John Plunkett, that there be an official inquiry into the expedition, including the Aboriginal deaths.

The colonial government and the Colonial Office in England were both conscious of a need to extend the rule of law to Aboriginals as well as other &quot;British subjects&quot; in the Colony.

On 6 April 1838 the Executive Council decided to issue regulations in the form of a government notice announcing that there would be an inquiry (that is, a coronial inquiry) into the death of any Aboriginal at the hands of a Colonist in the same way as that held when the death of a Colonist occurred through violence or suddenly. The decision to publish this Inquiry notice was delayed, with the Executive Council deciding to defer publication until after &quot;public excitement&quot; (about the Myall Creek murderers&#x27; executions) had abated.

On 14 August 1838 the Legislative Council appointed a Committee of Inquiry into &quot;the present state of Aborigines&quot;, to be presided over by the Anglican Bishop, William Broughton.

Gipps&#x27;s own inquiry into the Nunn expedition was delayed. He claimed to be unable to produce eyewitness evidence from mounted police owing to demands on police attendance elsewhere, and he could not afford to alienate the police volunteers upon whom policing then depended. 

Additionally, Colonists away from urban areas were tending to take the law into their own hands.

Some argue that there was a breakdown in law and order, affecting the capacity of the NSW Government to govern.

Although the Nunn inquiry was reactivated on 22 July 1839 at the Merton Courthouse, New South Wales, there were no convictions and the matter was dropped. The only eyewitness accounts of the fatal main engagement were provided by Lieutenant Cobban and Sergeant John Lee. Its outcome did not result in any further judicial proceedings.

Attorney General Plunkett was reluctant to prosecute any of Nunn&#x27;s expeditionary force, due to the time delays, the unavailability of reliable evidence and popular opposition.

The Executive Council decided to take no further action. It accepted that the Aboriginal deaths at Waterloo Creek were the consequence of the police, led by a military officer, acting honestly even if mistakenly or unwisely, under orders and in execution of their duty, to repel an &quot;aggressive attack&quot; by Aboriginals.

===Police statements===
Lieutenant Cobban claimed he rode to the rear of the group and found a large cache of Aboriginal weapons in the bush and secured them. When he returned to the river, he admitted to seeing two Aboriginals being shot, trying to escape and believed that at most three or four Aborigines had been killed in the conflict.

Sergeant John Lee was with the main detachment of mounted police that pursued the Aboriginals into the river. He claimed that 40 to 50 Aboriginals were killed.

==Later historians&#x27; views==
More recently, historians and other commentators have offered varying accounts of the site of the conflict and the number of casualties.

*R. H. W. Reece: The site was at the junction of the Slaughterhouse Creek and the Gwydir River, and 60 or 70 Aboriginals were killed.
*Lyndall Ryan: Sergeant Lee&#x27;s estimate of 40 to 50 killed is the most reliable.
*Roger Milliss: 200-300 Gamilaraay people were killed around the site of Snodgrass Lagoon at the Lower Waters of Waterloo Creek.

== Site ==
On 25 June 2021, the Waterloo Creek Massacre site at 3837 Millie Road, Jews Lagoon was declared a site of state heritage significance as &quot;a place of frontier conflict&quot; and listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. The site is recognised as a significant place as a place of memorial for the Aboriginal community that honours the resistance and resilience of their ancestors. Located along the Waterloo/Millie Creek waterway the site has been largely degraded with only remnant vegetation including leopardwood, weeping myall, brigalow and silver-leaved ironbark.

<doc id="615574" wikidata="Q81957" url="?curid=615574" title="Berm">
<text>A berm is a level space, shelf, or raised barrier (usually made of compacted soil) separating areas in a vertical way, especially partway up a long slope. It can serve as a terrace road, track, path, a fortification line, a border/separation barrier for navigation, good drainage, industry, or other purposes.

==Etymology==
The word is from Middle Dutch and came into usage in English via French.

==Military use==

=== History ===
In medieval military engineering, a berm (or berme) was a level space between a parapet or defensive wall and an adjacent steep-walled ditch or moat. It was intended to reduce soil pressure on the walls of the excavated part to prevent its collapse. It also meant that debris dislodged from fortifications would not fall into (and fill) a ditch or moat.

In the trench warfare of World War I, the name was applied to a similar feature at the lip of a trench, which served mainly as an elbow-rest for riflemen.

=== Modern usage ===
In modern military engineering, a berm is the earthen or sod wall or parapet, especially a low earthen wall adjacent to a ditch. The digging of the ditch (often by a bulldozer or military engineering vehicle) can provide the soil from which the berm is constructed. Walls constructed in this manner are an obstacle to vehicles, including most armoured fighting vehicles but are easily crossed by infantry. Because of the ease of construction, such walls can be made hundreds or thousands of kilometres long. A prominent example of such a berm is the Moroccan Western Sahara Wall.

==Erosion control==
Berms are also used to control soil erosion and sedimentation by reducing the rate of surface runoff. The berms either reduce the velocity of the water, or direct water to areas that are not susceptible to erosion, thereby reducing the adverse effects of running water on exposed topsoil. Following the 2010 &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the construction of berms designed to prevent oil from reaching the fragile Louisiana wetlands (which would result in massive erosion) was proposed early on, and was officially approved by the federal government in mid-June, 2010, after numerous failures to stop and contain the oil leak with more advanced technologies.

== Geography ==

In coastal geography, a berm is a bank of sand or gravel ridge parallel to the shoreline and a few tens of centimetres high, created by wave action throwing material beyond the average level of the sea.

==House construction==

Earth is piled up against exterior walls and packed, sloping down away from the house. The roof may or may not be fully earth covered, and windows/openings may occur on one or more sides of the shelter. Due to the building being above ground, fewer moisture problems are associated with earth berming in comparison to underground/fully recessed construction.

== Other applications ==

For general applications, a berm is a physical, stationary barrier of some kind. For example, in highway construction, a berm is a noise barrier constructed of earth, often landscaped, running along a highway to protect adjacent land users from noise pollution. The shoulder of a road is also called a berm and in New Zealand the word describes a publicly owned grassed nature strip sometimes planted with trees alongside urban roads (usually called a verge). In snowboard cross, a berm is a wall of snow built up in a corner. In mountain biking, a berm is a banked turn formed by soil, commonly dug from the track, being deposited on the outer rim of the turn. In coastal systems, a berm is a raised ridge of pebbles or sand found at high tide or storm tide marks on a beach. In snow removal, a berm or windrow refers to the linear accumulation of snow cast aside by a plow. Earth berms are used above particle accelerator tunnels to provide shielding from radiation. In open-pit mining, a berm refers to dirt and rock piled alongside a haulage road or along the edge of a dump point. Intended as a safety measure, they are commonly required by government organizations to be at least half as tall as the wheels of the largest mining machine on-site.

Physical security systems employ berms to exclude hostile vehicles and slow attackers on foot (similar to the military application without the trench). Security berms are common around military and nuclear facilities. An example is the berm proposed for Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vermont. At Baylor Ballpark, a baseball stadium on the campus of Baylor University, a berm is constructed down the right field line. The berm replaces bleachers, and general admission tickets are sold for fans who wish to sit on the grass or watch the game from the top of the hill.

Berms are also used as a method of environmental spill containment and liquid spill control. Bunding is the construction of a secondary impermeable barrier around and beneath storage or processing plant, sufficient to contain the plant&#x27;s volume after a spill. This is often achieved on large sites by surrounding the plant with a berm. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that oils and fuels stored over certain volume levels be placed in secondary spill containment. Berms for spill containment are typically manufactured from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or geomembrane fabric that provide a barrier to keep spills from reaching the ground or navigable waterways. Most berms have sidewalls to keep liquids contained for future capture and safe disposal.

<doc id="615577" wikidata="Q609104" url="?curid=615577" title="I Want to Hold Your Hand">
<text>&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Recorded on 17 October 1963 and released on 29 November 1963 in the United Kingdom, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track recording equipment.

With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the UK, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; would have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release had it not been blocked by the group&#x27;s first million-seller &quot;She Loves You&quot;, their previous UK single, which was having a resurgence of popularity following intense media coverage of the group. Taking two weeks to dislodge its predecessor, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; stayed at number one for five weeks and remained in the UK top 50 for 21 weeks in total.

It was also the group&#x27;s first American number-one hit, entering the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on 18 January 1964 at number 45 and starting the British Invasion of the American music industry. By 1 February, it topped the Hot 100 and stayed there for seven weeks before being replaced by &quot;She Loves You&quot;. It remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for 15 weeks. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; became the Beatles&#x27; best-selling single worldwide, selling more than 12 million copies. In 2018, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine named it the 48th biggest hit of all time on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In the UK, it was the second-highest-selling single of the 1960s, behind &quot;She Loves You&quot;.

==Background and composition==
Capitol Records&#x27; rejection of the group&#x27;s recordings in the US was now Brian Epstein&#x27;s primary concern, and he encouraged Lennon and McCartney to write a song to appeal specifically to the American market. George Martin, however, had no such explicit recollections, believing that Capitol was left with no alternative but to release &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; due to increasing demand for the group&#x27;s product.

McCartney had recently moved into 57 Wimpole Street, London, where he was lodging as a guest of Dr Richard and Margaret Asher, and whose daughter, actress Jane Asher, had become McCartney&#x27;s girlfriend earlier in the year. This location briefly became Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s new writing base, taking over from McCartney&#x27;s Forthlin Road home in Liverpool. Margaret Asher taught the oboe in the &quot;small, rather stuffy music room&quot; in the basement where Lennon and McCartney sat at the piano and composed &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. In September 1980, Lennon told &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine:

In 1994, McCartney agreed with Lennon&#x27;s description of the circumstances surrounding the composition of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, saying: &quot;&#x27;Eyeball to eyeball&#x27; is a very good description of it. That&#x27;s exactly how it was. &#x27;I Want to Hold Your Hand&#x27; was very co-written.&quot; According to Ian MacDonald, in keeping with how Lennon and McCartney collaborated at that time, lyrically bland, random phrases were most likely called out by the pair; if the phrases fitted the overall sound, they would stay. The song&#x27;s title was probably a variation of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, which the Beatles had recently recorded at EMI Studios.

==Musical structure==

Reminiscent of Tin Pan Alley and Brill Building techniques and an example of modified 32-bar form, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; is written on a two-bridge model, with only an intervening verse to connect them. The song has no real &quot;lead&quot; singer, as Lennon and McCartney sing alternately in unison and in harmony.

The song is in the key of G major and lyrically opens two beats early with &quot;&quot;Oh yeah&quot;, I&#x27;ll tell you something&quot; with a D-B, B-D melody note drop and rise over an I (G) chord. Controversy exists over the landmark chord that Lennon stated McCartney hit on the piano while they were composing the song. Wolf Marshall considers it to be the minor vi (Em) chord (the third chord in the I–V7–vi (G–D7–Em) progression). Walter Everett is of the same opinion. Dominic Pedler claims, however, that more surprising is the melody note drop from B to F against a III7 (B7) chord on &quot;understand&quot;.

==Recording==
The Beatles recorded &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; at EMI Studios in Studio 2 on 17 October 1963. This song, along with the single&#x27;s B-side, &quot;This Boy&quot;, was the first Beatles song to be recorded with four-track technology. The two songs were recorded on the same day, each needing seventeen takes. Mono and stereo mixing was done by George Martin on 21 October 1963; further stereo mixes were done on 8 June 1965, for compilations released by EMI affiliates in Australia and the Netherlands, and on 7 November 1966.

&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was one of two Beatles songs (along with &quot;She Loves You&quot; as &quot;Sie liebt dich&quot;) to be later recorded in German, entitled &quot;Komm, gib mir deine Hand&quot; (literally &quot;Come, give me your hand&quot;). Both songs were translated by Luxembourger musician Camillo Felgen, under the pseudonym of &quot;Jean Nicolas&quot;.
Odeon, the German arm of EMI (the parent company of the Beatles&#x27; record label, Parlophone) was convinced that the Beatles&#x27; records would not sell in Germany unless they were sung in German. The Beatles detested the idea, and when they were due to record the German version on 27 January 1964 at EMI&#x27;s Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris (where the Beatles were performing 18 days of concerts at the Olympia Theatre), they chose to boycott the session. Their record producer, George Martin, having waited some hours for them to show up, was outraged and insisted that they give it a try. Two days later, the Beatles recorded &quot;Komm, gib mir deine Hand&quot;, one of the few times in their career that they recorded outside London. However, Martin later conceded: &quot;They were right, actually, it wasn&#x27;t necessary for them to record in German, but they weren&#x27;t graceless, they did a good job&quot;.

&quot;Komm, gib mir deine Hand&quot; was released as a German single in March 1964. In July, the song appeared in full stereo in the United States on the Beatles&#x27; Capitol LP &quot;Something New&quot;. (That album was released in CD form for the first time in 2004, on &quot;The Capitol Albums, Volume 1&quot;, and then rereleased in 2014, individually and in the boxed set &quot;The US Albums&quot;.) &quot;Komm, gib mir deine Hand&quot; also appeared on the compilations &quot;Past Masters&quot; and &quot;Mono Masters&quot;.

==Promotion and release==

In the United Kingdom, &quot;She Loves You&quot; (released in August) shot back to the number-one position in November following blanket media coverage of the Beatles (described as Beatlemania). Mark Lewisohn later wrote: &quot;&#x27;She Loves You&#x27; had already sold an industry-boggling three-quarters of a million before these fresh converts were pushing it into seven figures. And at this very moment, just four weeks before Christmas, with everyone connected to the music and relevant retail industries already lying prone in paroxysms of unimaginable delight, EMI pulled the trigger and released &#x27;I Want to Hold Your Hand&#x27;. And then it was bloody pandemonium.&quot;

On 29 November 1963, Parlophone Records released &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; in the UK, with &quot;This Boy&quot; as the single&#x27;s B-side. Demand had been building for quite a while, as evidenced by the one million advance orders for the single. When it was finally released, the response was phenomenal. A week after it entered the British charts, on 14 December 1963, it knocked &quot;She Loves You&quot; off the top spot, the first instance of an act taking over from itself at number one in British history, and it clung to the top spot for five weeks. It stayed in the charts for another 15 weeks and made a one-week return to the charts on 16 May 1964. Beatlemania was peaking at that time; during the same period, the Beatles set a record by occupying the top two positions on both the album and single charts in the UK.

EMI and Brian Epstein finally convinced American label Capitol Records, a subsidiary of EMI, that the Beatles could make an impact in the US, leading to the release of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; with &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; on the B-side as a single on 26 December 1963. Capitol had previously resisted issuing Beatle recordings in the US. This resulted in the relatively modest Vee-Jay and Swan labels releasing the group&#x27;s earlier Parlophone counterparts in the US. Seizing the opportunity, Epstein demanded US$40,000 from Capitol to promote the single (the most the Beatles had ever previously spent on an advertising campaign was US$5,000). The single had actually been intended for release in mid-January 1964, coinciding with the planned appearance of the Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. However, a fourteen-year-old fan of the Beatles, Marsha Albert, wanted to hear the Beatles on the radio earlier. Later she said:
James was the DJ for WWDC, a radio station in Washington, DC. Eventually, he decided to pursue Albert&#x27;s suggestion. He asked the station&#x27;s promotion director to get British Overseas Airways Corporation to ship in a copy of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; from Britain. Albert related what happened next: &quot;Carroll James called me up the day he got the record and said, &#x27;If you can get down here by 5 o&#x27;clock, we&#x27;ll let you introduce it.&#x27;&quot; Albert managed to get to the station in time and introduced the record with: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time on the air in the United States, here are the Beatles singing &#x27;I Want to Hold Your Hand&#x27;.&quot;

The song proved to be a huge hit, a surprise for the station since they catered mainly to a more staid audience, which would typically be expecting songs from singers such as Andy Williams or Bobby Vinton instead of rock and roll. James took to playing the song repeatedly on the station, often turning it down in the middle to make the declaration, &quot;This is a Carroll James exclusive&quot;, to avoid theft of the song by other stations.

Capitol threatened to seek a court order banning airplay of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, which was already being spread by James to a couple of DJs in Chicago and St. Louis. James and WWDC ignored the threat, and Capitol concluded that they could take advantage of the publicity, releasing the single two weeks ahead of schedule on 26 December.

The demand was insatiable; in the first three days alone, a quarter of a million copies had already been sold (10,000 copies in New York City every hour). The demand so overloaded Capitol that it contracted part of the job of pressing copies off to Columbia Records and RCA. By 18 January, the song had started its 15-week chart run. On 1 February, the Beatles finally achieved their first number one on &quot;Billboard&quot; (replacing &quot;There! I&#x27;ve Said It Again&quot; by Bobby Vinton, emulating the success of another British group, the Tornados with &quot;Telstar&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for three weeks in December 1962. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; finally relinquished the number-one spot after seven weeks, succeeded by the song they had knocked off the top in Britain: &quot;She Loves You&quot;. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; sold around five million copies in the US alone. The replacement of themselves at the top of the US charts was the first time since Elvis Presley in 1956, with &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; beating out &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;, that an act had dropped off the top of the American charts only to be replaced by another of their releases. &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; also finished as the number one song for 1964, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed it as the 44th most successful song of all-time on the Hot 100.

With that, the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of America had been launched. Throughout 1964, British pop and rock artists enjoyed unprecedented success on the American charts.

The American single&#x27;s front and back sleeves featured a photograph of the Beatles with Paul McCartney holding a cigarette. In 1984, Capitol Records airbrushed out the cigarette for the re-release of the single.

&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was also released in America on the album &quot;Meet the Beatles!&quot;, which altered the American charts by actually outselling the single. Beforehand, the American markets favoured hit singles more than whole albums; however, two months after the album&#x27;s release, it had shipped 3,650,000 copies, over 200,000 ahead of the &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; single at 3,400,000.

The song was included on the 1964 Canadian release &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Long Tall Sally&quot;. The November 1966 stereo remix appeared on 1966&#x27;s &quot;A Collection of Beatles Oldies&quot;, and on several later Beatles compilation albums, including 1973&#x27;s &quot;1962–1966&quot;, 1982&#x27;s &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;, and 2000&#x27;s &quot;1&quot;. The 2009 CD rerelease of the Beatles&#x27; catalogue included the 1966 stereo remix on &quot;Past Masters&quot; and the original mono mix on &quot;Mono Masters&quot;.

==Reception and legacy==
The song was greeted by raving fans on both sides of the Atlantic but was dismissed by some critics as nothing more than another fad song that would not hold up to the test of time. Cynthia Lowery of the Associated Press expressed her exasperation with Beatlemania by saying of the Beatles: &quot;Heaven knows we&#x27;ve heard them enough. Getting a radio weather bulletin or time signal has been impossible without running into &#x27;I Want to Hold Your Hand&#x27;.&quot; &quot;Esquire&quot;″s music critic David Newman wrote, &quot;Terrible awful. ...It&#x27;s the bunk. The Beatles are indistinguishable from a hundred other similar loud and twanging rock-and-roll groups. They aren&#x27;t talented singers (as Elvis was), they aren&#x27;t fun (as Elvis was), they aren&#x27;t anything.&quot; In its contemporary review of the US single, &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as &quot;an infectious twist-like thumper that could spread like wildfire here.&quot;

In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald wrote that the song &quot;electrified American pop&quot;, adding: &quot;Every American artist, black or white, asked about &#x27;I Want to Hold Your Hand&#x27; has said much the same: it altered everything, ushering in a new era and changing their lives.&quot; Bob Dylan said: &quot;They were doing things nobody was doing. Their chords were outrageous, just outrageous, and their harmonies made it all valid.&quot; For a time, Dylan thought the Beatles were singing &quot;I get high&quot; instead of &quot;I can&#x27;t hide&quot;. He was surprised when he met them and found out that none of them had actually smoked marijuana. The Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson recalled his initial reaction to the song: &quot;I flipped. It was like a shock went through my system... I immediately knew that everything had changed&quot;; he said that he and Mike Love had a meeting to discuss the challenge presented by the Beatles, as &quot;For a while there, we felt really threatened.&quot; In another interview, Wilson said the song &quot;wasn&#x27;t even that great a record, but they [female Beatles fans] just screamed at it... It got us off our asses in the studio... we said &#x27;look, don&#x27;t worry about the Beatles, we&#x27;ll cut our own stuff.&#x27;&quot;

Discussing the Beatles&#x27; musical legacy in the 2004 edition of &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, Rob Sheffield states:
At the annual Ivor Novello Awards, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; finished second in the category &quot;The &#x27;A&#x27; Side of the Record Issued in 1963 Which Achieved the Highest Certified British Sales&quot;, behind &quot;She Loves You&quot;. The song was nominated for the 1964 Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Still, the award went to Astrud Gilberto and Stan Getz for &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;. However, in 1998, the song won the Grammy Hall of Fame. It has also made the list in The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. In addition, the Recording Industry Association of America, the National Endowment for the Arts and Scholastic Press have named &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; as one of the Songs of the Century. In 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the song at number 2 on its list of the 100 Greatest Beatles Songs, after &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. It was ranked number 2 in &quot;Mojo&quot;″s list on the &quot;100 Records That Changed the World&quot;, after Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot;. The song was ranked number 39 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s All Time Top 100. In 2011, &quot;Time&quot; included the song on its list of the All-TIME 100 Songs. , &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was the 18th best-selling single of all time in the UK.

Starting at the song&#x27;s final week at the top of the American charts, the Beatles have the all-time record of seven number-one songs in a one-year period. In order, these were &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;She Loves You&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot;, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; and &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot;. It was also the first of seven songs written by Lennon–McCartney to top the US charts in 1964—an all-time record for writing the most songs to hit number one on the US charts in the same calendar year.

<text>A T-bucket (or Bucket T) is a hot rod, based on a Ford Model T built from 1915 to 1927, but extensively modified. T-buckets were favorites for greasers.

==History==
Model Ts were hot-rodded and customized from the 1920s on, but the T-bucket was specifically created and named by Norm Grabowski in the 1950s. This car was named &quot;Lightning Bug&quot;, better known as the &quot;Kookie Kar&quot;, after being redesigned by Grabowski and appearing in the TV show &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, driven by character Gerald &quot;Kookie&quot; Kookson. The exposure it gained led to numerous copies being built.

A genuine T-bucket has the two-seater body of a Model T roadster (with or without the turtle deck or small pickup box), this &quot;bucket&quot;-shaped body shell giving the cars their name. A Model T-style radiator is usually fitted, and even these can sometimes be barely up to the task of cooling the large engines fitted. Windshields, when fitted, are vertical glass like the original Model T.

Today, T-buckets remain common. They generally feature an enormous engine for the size and weight of the car, generally a V8, along with tough drivetrains to handle the power and large rear tires to apply that power to the road. The front wheels are often much narrower than the rear wheels, and are often motorcycle wheels.

==Replicas==
Since the last Model Ts were built in 1927, most modern T-buckets use replica fiberglass bodies. By the 1950s, original steel Model T bodies that had not been completely worn out were becoming increasingly hard to find and in 1957 the first fiberglass T-Bucket body (based on the 1923 version) was introduced by the short-lived Diablo Speed Shop in Northern California. Of the only two or three bodies built by Diablo, one was purchased by Southern California hot rod builder Buzz Pitzen and became the world&#x27;s first fiberglass T-bucket.

==Show cars==
Most are built purely for street or show use, and the big engines are more for show than for need — many are more powerful than the vehicles can use. Although the body shell is original in appearance, engines of a wide variety of makes are commonly used. The small-block Chevrolet is a common choice, since it is relatively small, light, easy to obtain and to improve, and performs well. Four-cylinder engines are also common, especially if the car is used regularly. Some install superchargers on their engines, and some use modern fuel-injected engines.

==In popular culture==
A song celebrating the car, &quot;Bucket &#x27;T&#x27;,&quot; was written by Don Altfeld, Jan Berry, Roger Christian and Dean Torrence and first recorded by Jan &amp; Dean in 1964. Subsequent covers of the song were released by Ronny and the Daytonas in November 1964 and by The Who on November 11, 1966, as part of their EP &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot;.

<doc id="615582" wikidata="Q186181" url="?curid=615582" title="Colchicaceae">
<text>Colchicaceae is a family of flowering plants that includes 15 genera with a total of about 285 known species according to Christenhusz and Byng in 2016.

==Description==
The family is characterized by the presence of colchicine.

==Taxonomy==
The APG III system, of 2009 (unchanged from the APG systems, of 1998 and 2003), recognizes this family and places it in the order Liliales, in the clade monocots. It is a group of herbaceous perennials with rhizomes or corms.

The Dahlgren system and the Thorne system (1992) also recognized this family, and placed it in order Liliales in superorder Lilianae in subclass Liliidae (monocotyledons) of class Magnoliopsida (angiosperms).

===Genera===
The phylogenetic classification of Vinnersten &amp; Manning circumscribes the family as follows:

* tribe Burchardieae
** &quot;Burchardia&quot; 
* tribe Uvularieae
** &quot;Disporum&quot; (excluding the North American species to the genus &quot;Prosartes&quot; , now in the family Liliaceae, Liliales)
** &quot;Uvularia&quot; 
* tribe Tripladenieae
** &quot;Kuntheria&quot; 
** &quot;Schelhammera&quot; 
** &quot;Tripladenia&quot; 
* tribe Iphigenieae
** &quot;Camptorrhiza&quot; 
** &quot;Iphigenia&quot; 
* tribe Anguillarieae
** &quot;Baeometra&quot; 
** &quot;Wurmbea&quot; (including &quot;Neodregea&quot; and &quot;Onixotis&quot; )
* tribe Colchiceae
** &quot;Colchicum&quot; (including &quot;Androcymbium&quot; , &quot;Bulbocodium&quot; and &quot;Merendera&quot; )
** &quot;Gloriosa&quot; (including &quot;Littonia&quot; )
** &quot;Hexacyrtis&quot; 
** &quot;Ornithoglossum&quot; 
** &quot;Sandersonia&quot; 

The genus &quot;Petermannia&quot; F.Muell. is excluded from this family and placed in its own family Petermanniaceae, Liliales. The former controversy regarding the inclusion of &quot;Androcymbium&quot; in &quot;Colchicum&quot; has now been resolved in favor of the 2007 classification of Manning &quot;et al.&quot; who included &quot;Androcymbium&quot; in &quot;Colchicum&quot;. This is supported by molecular phylogenetic studies with dense species sampling (i.e. 41 species previously placed in &quot;Androcymbium&quot; and 96 species of &quot;Colchicum&quot;) that showed that the type species of &quot;Androcymbium&quot;, &quot;A. melanthioides&quot; (&quot;Colchicum melanthioides&quot;), is more closely related to species of &quot;Colchicum&quot; than it is to many species traditionally placed in &quot;Androcymbium&quot;.

Subsequently, Nguyen et al.(2013) proposed reclassifying the family on the basis of subfamilies: 
* Subfamily Uvularioideae (distribution: Eastern Asia and North America)
** Tribe Uvularieae (&quot;Disporum&quot;, &quot;Uvularia&quot;)
* Subfamily Wurmbeoideae (distribution: Australia, Africa, Europe, central and tropical Asia) 
** Tribe Burchardieae (&quot;Burchardia&quot;)
** Tribe Tripladenieae (&quot;Tripladenia&quot;, &quot;Schelhammera&quot;, &quot;Kuntheria&quot;)
** Tribe Iphigenieae (&quot;Iphigenia&quot;, &quot;Camptorrhiza&quot;)
** Tribe Angullarieae (&quot;Wurmbea&quot;, &quot;Onixotis&quot;, &quot;Neodregea&quot;, &quot;Baeometra&quot;)
** Tribe Colchiceae (&quot;Gloriosa&quot; (including &quot;Littonia&quot;), &quot;Colchicum&quot; (including &quot;Merendera&quot;, &quot;Bulbocodium&quot;, and probably &quot;Androcymbium&quot;), &quot;Hexacyrtis&quot;, &quot;Ornithoglossum&quot;, &quot;Sandersonia&quot;

<doc id="615588" wikidata="Q541570" url="?curid=615588" title="Sālote Tupou III">
<text>Sālote Tupou III (born Sālote Mafile‘o Pilolevu; 13 March 1900 – 16 December 1965) was Queen of Tonga from 1918 to her death in 1965. She reigned for nearly 48 years, the longest of any Tongan monarch. She was well known for her height, standing 6 ft 3 in (1.91 metres) tall in her prime.

== Early life and education ==

Sālote (Charlotte) was born on 13 March 1900 in Tonga as the eldest daughter and heir of King George Tupou II of Tonga and his first wife Queen Lavinia Veiongo. She was baptized and named after her great-grandmother Sālote Mafile‘o Pilolevu (daughter of George Tupou I). The young princess was the source of some hostility due to the nature of her parents&#x27; marriage.

Her mother, Queen Lavinia, died from tuberculosis on 24 April 1902. After her death, the Chiefs in Tonga urged King George Tupou II for many years to remarry to produce a male heir. On 11 November 1909, when the King finally married the 16-year-old ʻAnaseini Takipō (half-sister of the rejected candidate ‘Ofakivava‘u from the first search of a wife for the King), the chiefs were jubilant. Queen Anaseni gave birth twice, both girls: Princess ʻOnelua (born 20 March 1911; died of convulsions aged six months, on 19 August 1911) and Princess ʻElisiva Fusipala Taukiʻonetuku (born 26 July 1912; died from tubercular peritonitis on 21 April 1933 aged 20).

Tongan tradition allows offsprings from previous marriages to be killed. In order to protect her, the King sent Sālote away to Auckland in December 1909. She stayed with a family called Kronfeld and would maintain this connection throughout her life. She was educated for five years in New Zealand, returning to Tonga every Christmas holiday.

In 1913, Sālote was sent to the Anglican Diocesan School for Girls, a boarding school in Epsom, New Zealand. She would study there for two years before being ordered to stay in Tonga. Although the King wanted Sālote to continue her education, the chiefs convinced him otherwise. Queen Takipō had not given birth to a son and hence according to the Constitution of 1875, after her fifteenth birthday, Sālote became the heir presumptive to the Tongan throne. 

== Marriage ==
In 1917, Sālote married Viliami Tungī Mailefihi, an adult noble then 30 years old, 13 years her senior. Her marriage had been a political masterstroke by her father, as Tungī was a direct descendant of the Tu‘i Ha‘atakalaua. Their children, therefore, would combine the blood of the three grand royal dynasties in Tonga. At the age of 18, she became a mother for the first time. Her children were:

* King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, born Crown Prince Siaosi Tāufaʻāhau Tupoulahi (4 July 1918 – 10 September 2006); 
* Prince Uiliami Tuku‘aho (5 November 1919 – 28 April 1936), who died young; 
* Prince Sione Ngū Manumataongo, later the 5th Tuʻipelehake (Fatafehi) (7 January 1922 – 10 April 1999).
Three pregnancies ended in miscarriages.

== Reign ==
Sālote was proclaimed Queen on 6 April 1918, following her father&#x27;s death from tuberculosis the previous day.

In 1920–1921, she assisted the Bernice P. Bishop Museum&#x27;s Bayard Dominick Expedition with their mapping of Tongan archaeological sites by providing access to localities and information. The expedition&#x27;s reports on the Tongan past—including a large volume of material which still remains unpublished even today—were primarily compiled by Edward Winslow Gifford and provided the groundwork for comprehensive studies of the pre-contact history of the Tongans (Burley 1998). She was also a keen writer and author of dance songs and love poems, published in 2004, edited by her biographer, Elizabeth Wood-Ellem.

Sālote led Tonga through World War II, with the islands declaring war on Germany in 1940 and on Japan in 1941 following the attack on Pearl Harbor. She put Tonga&#x27;s resources at the disposal of Britain and supported the Allied cause throughout the war. Tongan troops saw battle against the Japanese in the Solomon Islands campaign, including on Guadalcanal.

A key advisor of Sālote&#x27;s, from 1924 to 1946, was Australian missionary Rodger Page, who played a key role in the reunification of the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga, of which she was a member. Owing to his influence on Sālote, Page was described as a form of power behind the throne by historian Sione Lātūkefu.

She brought Tonga to international attention when, during her sole visit to Europe, she attended the 1953 coronation of Elizabeth II in London. During the coronation procession, it began to rain and hoods were placed on the carriages in the procession. As Tongan custom dictates that one should not imitate the actions of persons one is honouring, she refused a hood and rode through the pouring rain in an open carriage with Sultan Ibrahim of Kelantan, endearing herself to spectators. She served as Chairman of the Tonga Traditions Committee from 1954 and patronised the Tonga Red Cross Society.

Many Tongans respected and approved of Sālote, seeing her as &quot;tough, hard-working, just, ambitious&quot;. She was also very approachable, with her palace doors being open to all. This led to her being very knowledgeable not just of Tongan tradition (which she was already well-versed from prior to her marriage), but also of specific family histories, which are very important in Tongan culture. She would often assist and impress visiting anthropologists with her detailed knowledge of the culture.

== Illness and death ==
Sālote had a somewhat troubled medical history. She suffered from diabetes, requiring frequent visits to Auckland for treatment. An operation had to be conducted in 1935 to treat her cancer. During tests in Auckland in 1965 a second bout of cancer was found. Despite this, the Queen returned to Tonga in May and even participated in a festival in July 1965 celebrating her record reign. Ten thousand children were allowed to enter the palace grounds and wave at the Queen as she sat on the verandah. This would be the last time the Tongan people saw their Queen.

Queen Sālote died in hospital in Auckland on 16 December 1965 at 12:15 am. Her body was flown back to Tonga by the Royal New Zealand Air Force. The funeral service took place on 23 December with fifty thousand people in attendance. Her body was placed next to her husband and her tomb was guarded for several nights, as per tradition.

== Depictions in popular culture ==
Trinidadian-Venezuelan musician Edmundo Ros composed, recorded, and performed a calypso song titled &quot;The Queen of Tonga&quot; whose lyrics refer to Queen Sālote attending the coronation of Elizabeth II.

<text>George Tupou II (; 18 June 1874 – 5 April 1918) was the King of Tonga from 18 February 1893 until his death. He was officially crowned at Nukuʻalofa, on 17 March 1893. He was also the 20th Tuʻi Kanokupolu.

== Life ==
Siaosi (George) Tupou II was related to his predecessor and founder of the united Tongan Kingdom, King George Tupou I, Tāufaʻāhau Tupou I on both sides of his family. His father was Prince Tuʻi Pelehake Fatafehi Toutaitokotaha, who was also Prime Minister of Tonga in 1905. Fatafehi&#x27;s mother Sālote Pilolevu was a daughter of Tāufaʻāhau Tupou I. Siaosi Tupou II&#x27;s mother was Fusipala Taukiʻonetuku, a daughter of Tēvita ʻUnga who was a son of Tāufaʻāhau Tupou I.

Tupou II&#x27;s reign was troubled by government corruption and inefficiency. The Tongan Parliament in 1900 was suspicious of Tupou II&#x27;s governing and audited his accounts several times, finding discrepancies worth thousands of pounds. The expatriate community in Tonga called for its annexation to New Zealand.

Before he was married to Lavinia Veiongo, he had an intimate relationship with Margaret Cocker, which resulted in two children, Uaia and Ana Fakalelu Kihe Fana. These two children were kept a secret due to the implications of the King having relations with a commoner from England. Uaia continued to live in the palace while his sister Ana was entrusted into the care of a chieftain of Uiha Malupo (Takapautolo). He had a close relationship with his daughter Sālote.

He shared his common love of writing songs and poems with his earlier Hawaiʻian colleague Kalakaua. He is also known for his support of constructing cement water tanks (&quot;vaisima&quot;) throughout Tonga to provide clean water to the people and improve public health.
He ascended the throne at the age of 18, upon the death of his great-grandfather George Tupou I, at which time he was still a bachelor. In 1896, the chiefs of the country urged him to marry and produce an heir. After her death, the chiefs suggested a new wife, ʻOfa-ki-Vavaʻu, the daughter of Māʻatu from Niuatoputapu, who was related to the Tuʻi Haʻatakalaua line. George, however, refused. In 1898, the King intended to marry Jane (Eugenie) von Treskow, the half-caste daughter of the German Vice-Consul Waldemar von Treskow, but Parliament registered its objection to this choice when it presented Tupou with its own nominations. Finally, on 1 June 1899, he took Lavinia Veiongo (1879–1902) as his wife. She was the daughter of Kupuavanua from Vavaʻu and Tōkanga from Niuafoʻou, thus obliging these islands to the throne. Kupuavanua was also, through his mother Lavinia Veiongo (1828–1907), a grandson of the last Tuʻi Tonga Laufilitonga, thus enabling him to claim rights to that line as well. Nevertheless, the marriage nearly started a civil war. For years, relations between the king and the rest of the country remained tense. In addition to his inept governance, this ongoing strain led in 1900 to Tonga&#x27;s becoming a British protectorate.
Queen Lavinia died on 25 April 1902 from tuberculosis, leaving one child, Sālote (born 13 March 1900). She was considered unpopular as she was perceived as being born from the &#x27;wrong&#x27; mother; so much so that it was not safe for her to go outside the palace garden. When Siaosi married for the second time, on 11 November 1909, to the then 16-year-old ʻAnaseini Takipō Afuha&#x27;amango, a half-sister of the rejected ʻOfakivava&#x27;u, the chiefs were jubilant. It was customary in pre-modern Polynesia for a defeated chief either to be killed or to be exiled. As such, it was a fortunate excuse that Sālote had to go to school in Auckland and so she could be put on the December steamer to New Zealand.

Queen Anaseini Takipō was the daughter of Tae Manusa and Tevita Ula Afuha&#x27;amango. Tae Manusa was the highest ranking woman in Tonga (after the death of the last Tamahā) as she had a direct bloodline to Tu&#x27;iHa&#x27;atakalaua and Tu&#x27;iKanokupolu, which made her daughters the perfect option for Tupou II to marry.

Tae Manusa was the daughter of Penisimani Latuselu Kaho and his wife (also his first cousin) Ilaisa&#x27;ane Tupou&#x27;ahau (daughter of Maealiuaki Fatukimotulalo Tu&#x27;iHa&#x27;atakalaua). Penisimani Latuselu was also the son of Nunufa&#x27;ikea Tuita and Paluleleva Mulikiha&#x27;amea (sister of Maealiuaki and the Mehekitanga of Tupou&#x27;ahau). Both Nunufa&#x27;ikea and Paluleleva were great-grandchildren of King Ma&#x27;afu&#x27;o&#x27;Tu&#x27;itonga Tu&#x27;iKanokupolu, which made both Ofakivava&#x27;u and Takipō to be the most suitable brides for George Tupou II.

Sālote would remain in exile for 5 years. Queen Takipō had still not brought forth a son. Her first daughter, ʻOnelua (born 20 March 1911), died of convulsions while only six months, on 19 August 1911; her second daughter, ʻElisiva Fusipala Taukiʻonetuku (born 26 July 1912), eventually died from tubercular peritonitis on 21 April 1933 aged 20. The hope the envying chiefs had had on an heir through Takipō was fading, and the hope for supporters of Sālote&#x27;s rose. The need to find a politically acceptable husband for her became imperative, and he was found in the end in Tungī Mailefihi, a cousin of ʻOfa.

Siaosi had also a few children from other women. Some of these descendants became prominent politicians in Fiji, such as Edward Cakobau. Other children became high-ranking chiefs in Tonga itself (Vīlai Tupou, father of Baron Vaea). His own government was ineffective with some ministers contemplated permitting British annexation of the country. The death of the king in April 1918 was soon followed by his wife Takipō (1 March 1893 – 26 November 1918) from the infamous Spanish flu epidemic raging in Tonga. Siaosi&#x27;s daughter Sālote succeeded him and was proclaimed Queen Sālote Tupou III.

== Honours ==
He was Grand Master of the Royal Orders of Tonga that he founded:
** Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Order of Pouono (KGCCP) (founded in 1893)
** Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Order of King George Tupou I (founded ca. in 1876–1890)
** Knight Grand Cross with Collar of the Royal Order of the Crown of Tonga (founded in 1913)

<text>George Tupou I (4 December 1797 – 18 February 1893), originally known as Tāufaʻāhau I, was the first king of modern Tonga. He adopted the name Siaosi (originally Jiaoji), the Tongan equivalent of &quot;George&quot;, after King George III of the United Kingdom, when he was baptized in 1831. His nickname was &quot;Lopa-ukamea&quot; (or Lopa-ʻaione), meaning &quot;iron cable&quot;.

== Biography ==

=== Birth ===
George Tupou I was born around 1797 in Tonga. 4 December is often-quoted as his birthday and is a public holiday in Tonga; however, it was the date of his coronation in 1845 as Tuʻi Kanokupolu, when he took the name Tupou. Tongoleleka and the Niuʻui hospital there (which was destroyed in the 2006 Tonga earthquake) are often stated as his birthplace; however, no evidence supporting this is available, and Lifuka and Tongatapu are also often stated as the birthplace. His father was Tupouto&#x27;aʻ, who aspired to be the 17th Tuʻi Kanokupolu, but he was not recognized as such by the high chiefs of Tongatapu, as he was viewed as a low ranking usurper from Haʻapai. His mother, Hoamofaleono, felt her life was at risk on Tongatapu, so she fled with her son to Haʻapai, probably within the year of his birth. Her history, as well as her son Maeakafa&#x27;s history, is more reliably tracked to Haʻapai Island.

The pregnant Hoamo fale ono felt insecure in Tongatapu as she was about to give birth to a child whose father, Tupouto&#x27;a, was the primary adversary of her clan (Ha&#x27;a Havea Lahi). Tupouto&#x27;a was in Ha&#x27;apai to kill Tupounia and &#x27;Ulukalala in order to avenge the assassination of his father, Tuku&#x27;aho. Tuku&#x27;aho was cruel and feared by all, including Ha&#x27;a Havea Lahi chiefs, given such acts as the burning of Fangale&#x27;ounga, a Vaini colony of Ma&#x27;afutuku&#x27;i&#x27;aulahi. Niukapu, a chief, fled to Ha&#x27;apai under the protection of the Ha&#x27;atalafale Tu&#x27;ipelehake. These chiefs supported Tupou Moheofo, installed as Tu&#x27;i Kanokupolu, instead of Tuku&#x27;aho&#x27;s father, Mumui. The retribution by Tuku&#x27;aho on Ha&#x27;a Havea was regarded, despite the fact Niukapu was not part of the clan, as a demotion in power and a display of disrespect of territorial boundaries. Since then, Tuku&#x27;aho&#x27;s siblings and descendants have had antagonistic feelings towards those from Ha&#x27;a Havea.

=== Coronation ===
George Tupou was established as the Tuʻi Haʻapai (High king) before the death of his father in 1820. He inherited the conflicts with the overlords of Tongatapu, in particular with Laufilitonga, the last Tuʻi Tonga, who tried to extend his role as spiritual leader into a more political one and contested Tāufaʻāhau in Haʻapai. The culmination of this struggle was the Battle of Velata in 1826, in which Laufilitonga was defeated. An important ally at that battle was the chief of Haʻafeva.

It was now clear that Tāufaʻāhau was very ambitious and wanted more than only Haʻapai. To stop him, in 1827, the chiefs of Tongatapu made Laufilitonga the Tuʻi Tonga, and made Tāufa&#x27;s uncle Aleamotuʻa a Tuʻi Kanokupolu, preventing an island invasion, as fighting against family members was seen as a Tongan disgrace. In spite of this, at his baptism in 1831, Tāufa declared himself King George of Tonga.

His next conquest resulted from his relationships with Fīnau ʻUlukālala III, the ruler of Vavaʻu. He became the Tuʻi Vavaʻu after Finau&#x27;s death in 1833. He dedicated Tonga (that is, Pouono in Vavaʻu) to God in 1839, assuring support from the missionaries.

During the 1830s, he resided in Vavaʻu, in Veitatalo, which is now ʻUlukālala&#x27;s residence. Vavaʻu was at peace and it prospered. Tongatapu, on the other hand, suffered from a cruel civil war with the local chiefs fighting each other. Tāufaʻāhau launched raids on Tongatapu with his fierce warriors from Haʻapai and Vavaʻu, the Tautahi (sea warriors). However, it was not until Aleamotuʻa&#x27;s death that year, that he had an excuse to conquer Tongatapu. The chiefs were forced to obey him, and he was installed as Tuʻi Kanokupolu in Kolovai on 4 December. Niuafoʻou and Niuatoputapu would follow later. &#x27;Eua was never conquered by Tāufaʻāhau. However, It was Kauvakauta of &#x27;Eua whom conquered The Mighty Kolo Tau o Velata in Ha&#x27;apai and assisted Tāufaʻāhau with guns and ammunition for his wars throughout Tonga.
In 1852, the last independent chief, Takai Mo Fa&#x27;e, fell and Tāufa became the undisputed leader of the whole of Tonga. His rule saw many changes in Tongan politics. He abolished serfdom in Vavaʻu in 1835, and published the Vavaʻu Code in 1838, the first written laws in Tonga. However, he would not officially abolish serfdom everywhere in Tonga. He opened the first parliament until 4 June 1862, which is still a public holiday called Emancipation Day, in Tonga.

He made Pangai Ha&#x27;apai the first capital of his realm in 1845. He then moved the capital to Nukuʻalofa in 1851 (resided in Lifuka from 1845 to 1851). On 4 November 1875 (also a holiday), the constitution was promulgated and Tonga officially became a kingdom. Siaosi then took the name George Tupou I, King of Tonga. For this reason, both 1845 and 1875 are quoted as the beginning of his reign.

=== Death ===

He died in 1893 at the age of 95, after a swim in the sea near his palace. He was buried in the New Royal Cemetery in Malaʻekula. His children had predeceased him, so he was succeeded by his great-grandson twice over George Tupou II – the son of the daughter (ʻElisiva Fusipala Taukiʻonetuku) of his son (Tēvita ʻUnga) and the son (Siaosi Tuʻipelehake) of his daughter (Salote Pilolevu Mafileʻo). This makes him one of only two monarchs in history alongside Louis XIV of France who is known to have been succeeded by a great-grandson.

== Legacy ==
Due to the leadership of King Siaosi I, the history of Tonga is quite different from that of other Polynesian islands. He was a man foreign powers spoke to on equal footing, which protected Tonga from colonization.

During his trip to Australia and New Zealand in 1853, when asking about the beggars he saw, he was told that they were unable to work since they had no land. This led to the constitution stating that land in Tonga could only be given to natural-born Tongans and not sold to outsiders, as is still the case today.

<text>Schwerin Castle (, also known as &quot;Schwerin Palace&quot;, ( or ) is a 19th-century &quot;Schloss&quot; built in the historicist style located in the city of Schwerin, the capital of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state, Germany. It is situated on an island in the city&#x27;s main lake, Lake Schwerin.

For centuries, the castle on the present site was the home of the dukes and grand dukes of Mecklenburg and later Mecklenburg-Schwerin, although few parts of the pre-19th-century castle have survived. Today, parts of the castle serve as the residence of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state parliament () while other parts are used for the palace museum, a restaurant, and cultural events, like open-air theatre in the courtyard.

Significant parts of the current palace were built between 1845 and 1857 as a collaboration between the eminent historicist architects Gottfried Semper, Friedrich August Stüler, Georg Adolf Demmler, and Ernst Friedrich Zwirner. The castle is regarded as one of the most important works of Romantic historicism in Europe, and is nicknamed the &quot;Neuschwanstein of the North&quot;.

In 2023, Schwerin Castle was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

==History==
===Early years===
The first records of a structure at this location date from AD 973, a fort belonging to the Polabian Slav tribe of the Obotrites on an island in the large lake of Schwerin.
In 1160, the fort became a target of Germanic noblemen planning to expand their territory eastward under the leadership of Henry the Lion (1129–1195). The Obotrites under Niklot destroyed the fort but left because of the Germanic military dominance. The German conquerors recognised the island&#x27;s strategic and aesthetically interesting location and started building a new fort. The foundation of the city of Schwerin took place in the same year. Schwerin became the seat of a bishopric.

In 1167, Henry gave the County of Schwerin to his vassal Gunzelin von Hagen, and the rest of the country around the city was returned to Niklot&#x27;s son Pribislav, forming a hereditary ducal line that lasted until 1918. In 1358, the County of Schwerin was purchased by the descendants of Niklot, who had been elevated to Dukes of Mecklenburg in 1348. They soon relocated further inland from &quot;Mikelenburg&quot;, near the city of Wismar, to Schwerin. During the late Gothic era, the growing prosperity and position of the dukes led to a growing need for a representative castle, which meant architectural changes to the fortress settlement. The Bishop&#x27;s House (&quot;Bischofshaus&quot;) from that period remains in a grave.

=== Renaissance (15th–18th centuries) ===
Under John Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg (1525–1576), the building experienced important changes. The fort became a palace, and its defensive functionality was replaced with ornamentation and concessions to comfort. The use of terracotta during the Renaissance was dominant in North German architecture, and Schwerin&#x27;s terracotta was supplied from Lübeck.
A few years after reworking the main building itself, from 1560 to 1563, John Albert rebuilt the palace&#x27;s chapel. It became the state&#x27;s first new Protestant church. The architecture was inspired by churches in Torgau and Dresden. The early Venetian Renaissance gate, its gable showing the carrying of the cross, was made by Hans Walther (1526–1600), a sculptor from Dresden. Windows on the northern face show biblical illustrations by Flemish artist Willem van den Broecke (also known as &quot;Paludanus&quot;; 1530–1579).

Despite its island site, the ducal residence needed additional defences; sometime in the middle of the 16th century, bastions were established to the northwest, southwest and southeast. They were probably built by the same Italian architects who, under Francesco a Bornau, also designed the Dömitz Fortress. The bastions were modified several times later and are still standing today.

Before the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the architect Ghert Evert Piloot, who had entered Mecklenburg&#x27;s service in 1612, made plans to completely rebuild the palace in the style of the Renaissance in the Low Countries. In 1617, work began under his supervision but soon had to cease because of the war. Piloot&#x27;s plans were partially realized between 1635 and 1643: the house above the palatial kitchen and that above the chapel were razed and given Dutch Renaissance style façades.

During this period, a half-timbered building was constructed near the chapel to house the archducal collection of paintings. Also, the &quot;Teepavillon&quot; (tea house) was built. The court moved to Ludwigslust Palace in 1756.

=== 19th century onward ===
In 1837, the ducal residence moved back to Schwerin, but the building was in relatively bad condition, and the Grand Duke disliked the individual buildings&#x27; incongruent origins and architectural styles.
Grand Duke Friedrich (1800–1842) instructed his architect Georg Adolph Demmler (1804–1886) to remodel the palace. A few months later, construction was halted by his successor, Friedrich Franz II (1823–1883), who wanted a complete reconstruction of the historic site. Only some parts of the building dating from the 16th and 17th centuries were retained.
Dresden architect Gottfried Semper (1803–1879) and Berlin architect Friedrich August Stüler (1800–1865) could not convince the Grand Duke of their plans. Instead, Demmler included elements from both of them into his plan, but found inspiration in French Renaissance castles. The castle became the most admired masterpiece of the student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. He also planned a government building in 1825–1826 located at Schlossstraße (today the State Chancellery). Renaissance châteaux of the Loire Valley (such as Chambord) also inspired him and contributed to the construction from 1843 until 1851. His successor, Stüler, again made a few alterations, including an equestrian statue of Niklot and the cupola.

Heinrich Strack (1805–1880) from Berlin was chosen for the interior design. Most of the work was carried out by craftsmen from Schwerin and Berlin. A fire destroyed about a third of the palace in December 1913. Only the exterior reconstruction had been completed when the revolution of 1918 resulted in the abdication of the Grand Duke. The castle later became a museum and, in 1948, the seat of the state parliament. The German Democratic Republic used the palace as a college for kindergarten teachers from 1952 to 1981. Then it was a museum again until 1993. The Orangerie had been a technical museum since 1961. From 1974 on, some renovated rooms were used as an art museum.

Since late 1990, it has once again been a seat of government as the seat of the &quot;Landtag&quot; (the state assembly of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern). Since then, there have been massive preservation and renovation efforts. Most of these were finished by 2019.

Currently, the building houses the regional parliament and an educational center for kindergarten teachers.

==Ghost of Petermännchen==
The ghost Petermännchen (&quot;little Peterman&quot;) is said to roam the halls of the Schweriner Schloss. This invisible little creature is said to be no more than a few feet high and is often depicted in clothes from the 17th century, something resembling a cavalier. Other legends describe him as a long-bearded blacksmith, night watchman, or prankster to those who would seek to harm or steal from the castle.

<doc id="615613" wikidata="Q1826411" url="?curid=615613" title="Line of Actual Control">
<text>The Line of Actual Control (LAC), in the context of the Sino-Indian border dispute, is a notional demarcation line
that separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory. The concept was introduced by Chinese premier Zhou Enlai in a 1959 letter to Jawaharlal Nehru as the &quot;line up to which each side exercises actual control&quot;, but rejected by Nehru as being incoherent. Subsequently, the term came to refer to the line formed after the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

The LAC is different from the borders claimed by each country in the Sino-Indian border dispute. The Indian claims include the entire Aksai Chin region and the Chinese claims include Arunachal Pradesh/Zangnan. These claims are not included in the concept of &quot;actual control&quot;.

The LAC is generally divided into three sectors:
* the western sector between Ladakh on the Indian side and the Tibet and Xinjiang autonomous regions on the Chinese side. This sector was the location of the 2020 China–India skirmishes.
* the middle sector between Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh on the Indian side and the Tibet autonomous region on the Chinese side.
* the eastern sector between Arunachal Pradesh/Zangnan on the Indian side and the Tibet autonomous region on the Chinese side. This sector generally follows the McMahon Line.

The term &quot;line of actual control&quot; originally referred only to the boundary in the western sector after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, but during the 1990s came to refer to the entire de facto border.

==Overview==
The term &quot;line of actual control&quot; is said to have been used by Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai in a 1959 note to Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The boundary existed only as an informal cease-fire line between India and China after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. In 1993, India and China agreed to respect of the &#x27;Line of Actual Control&#x27; in a bilateral agreement, without demarcating the line itself.

In a letter dated 7 November 1959, Zhou proposed to Nehru that the armed forces of the two sides should withdraw 20 kilometres from the so-called McMahon Line in the east and &quot;the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west&quot;. Nehru rejected the proposal stating that there was complete disagreement between the two governments over the facts of possession:

Scholar Stephen Hoffmann states that Nehru was determined not to grant legitimacy to a concept that had no historical validity nor represented the situation on the ground.
During the Sino-Indian War (1962), Nehru again refused to recognise the line of control: &quot;There is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call &#x27;line of actual control&#x27;. What is this &#x27;line of control&#x27;? Is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of September? Advancing forty or sixty kilometers by blatant military aggression and offering to withdraw twenty kilometers provided both sides do this is a deceptive device which can fool nobody.&quot;

Zhou responded that the LAC was &quot;basically still the line of actual control as existed between the Chinese and Indian sides on 7 November 1959. To put it concretely, in the eastern sector it coincides in the main with the so-called McMahon Line, and in the western and middle sectors it coincides in the main with the traditional customary line which has consistently been pointed out by China.&quot;

The term &quot;LAC&quot; gained legal recognition in Sino-Indian agreements signed in 1993 and 1996. The 1996 agreement states, &quot;No activities of either side shall overstep the line of actual control.&quot; However, clause number 6 of the 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas mentions, &quot;The two sides agree that references to the line of actual control in this Agreement do not prejudice their respective positions on the boundary question&quot;.

The Indian government claims that Chinese troops continue to illegally enter the area hundreds of times every year, including aerial sightings and intrusions. In 2013, there was a three-week standoff (2013 Daulat Beg Oldi incident) between Indian and Chinese troops 30 km southeast of Daulat Beg Oldi. It was resolved and both Chinese and Indian troops withdrew in exchange for an Indian agreement to destroy some military structures over 250 km to the south near Chumar that the Chinese perceived as threatening.

In October 2013, India and China signed a border defence cooperation agreement to ensure that patrolling along the LAC does not escalate into armed conflict. 

In October 2024, India announced that it had reached an agreement over patrolling arrangements along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border area, which would lead to disengagement and resolution of the long-running conflict that began in 2020.

== Evolution of the LAC ==

=== Predecessors ===
=== 1956 and 1960 claim lines ===


=== LAC of 7 November 1959 ===
The date of 7 November 1959, on which the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai alluded to the concept of &quot;line of actual control&quot;, achieved a certain sanctity in Chinese nomenclature. But there was no line defined in 1959. Scholars state that Chinese maps had shown a steadily advancing line in the western sector of the Sino-Indian boundary, each of which was identified as &quot;the line of actual control as of 7 November 1959&quot;.

On 24 October 1962, after the initial thrust of the Chinese forces in the Sino-Indian War, the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai wrote to the heads of ten African and Asian nations outlining his proposals for peace, a fundamental tenet of which was that both sides should undertake not to cross the &quot;line of actual control&quot;. This letter was accompanied by certain maps which again identified the &quot;line of actual control as of 7 November 1959&quot;. Margaret Fisher calls it the &quot;line of actual control as of 7 November 1959&quot; &quot;as published in November 1962&quot;. Scholar Stephen Hoffmann states that the line represented not any position held by the Chinese on 7 November 1959, but rather incorporated the gains made by the Chinese army before and after the massive attack on 20 October 1962. In some cases, it went beyond the territory the Chinese army had reached.

India&#x27;s understanding of the 1959 line passed through Haji Langar, Shamal Lungpa and Kongka La (the red line shown on Map 2).

Even though the Chinese-claimed line was not acceptable to India as the depiction of an actual position, it was apparently acceptable as the line from which the Chinese would undertake to withdraw 20 kilometres. Despite the non-acceptance by India of the Chinese proposals, the Chinese did withdraw 20 kilometres from this line, and henceforth continued to depict it as the &quot;line of actual control of 1959&quot;.

In December 1962, representatives of six African and Asian nations met in Colombo to develop peace proposals for India and China. Their proposals formalised the Chinese pledge of 20-kilometre withdrawal and the same line was used, labelled as &quot;the line from which the Chinese forces will withdraw 20 km.&quot;

This line was essentially forgotten by both sides till 2013, when the Chinese PLA revived it during its Depsang incursion as a new border claim.

=== Line separating the forces before 8 September 1962 ===
At the end of the 1962 war, India demanded that the Chinese withdraw to their positions on 8 September 1962 (the blue line in Map 2).

=== 1993 agreement ===

Political relations following the 1962 war only saw signs of improvement towards the later 1970s and 80s. Ties had remained strained until then also because of Chinese attraction to Pakistan during India Pakistan wars in 1965 and 1971. Restored ambassadorial relations in 1976, a visit of the Indian Prime Minister to China in 1988, a visit of the Chinese Premier to India in 1992 and then a visit of Indian President to China in 1992 preceded the 1993 agreement. Prior to the 1993 agreement, a trade agreement was signed in 1984, followed by a cultural cooperation agreement in 1988.

The 1993 agreement, signed on 7 September, was the first bilateral agreement between China and India to contain the phrase Line of Actual Control. The agreement covered force level, consultations as a way forward and the role of a Joint Working Group. The agreement made it clear that there was an &quot;ultimate solution to the boundary question between the two countries&quot; which remained pending. It was also agreed that &quot;the two sides agree that references to the line of actual control in this Agreement do not prejudice their respective positions on the boundary question&quot;.

== Clarification of the LAC ==

In article 10 of the 1996 border agreement, both sides agreed to the exchange of maps to help clarify the alignment of the LAC. It was only in 2001 when the first in-depth discussion would take place with regard to the central/middle sectors. Maps of Sikkim were exchanged, resulting in the &quot;Memorandum on Expanding Border Trade&quot;. However the process of exchange of maps soon collapsed in 2002–2003 when other sectors were brought up. Shivshankar Menon writes that a drawback of the process of exchanging maps as a starting point to clarify the LAC was that it gave both sides an &quot;incentive to exaggerate their claims of where the LAC lay&quot;.

On 30 July 2020, the Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong stated that China was not in favour of clarifying the LAC anymore as it would create new disputes. Similar viewpoints have been aired in India that China will keep the boundary dispute alive for as long as it can be used against India. On the other hand, there have been voices which say that clarifying the LAC would be beneficial for both countries.

== Patrol points ==

In the 1970s, India&#x27;s China Study Group identified patrol points to which Indian forces would patrol. This was a better representation of how far India could patrol towards its perceived LAC and delimited India&#x27;s limits of actual control. These periodic patrols were performed by both sides, and often crisscrossed.

Patrolling Points were identified by India&#x27;s China Study Group in the 1970s to optimize patrolling effectiveness and resource utilization along the disputed and non-demarcarted China-India border at a time when border infrastructure was weak. Instead of patrolling the entire border which was more than 3000 km long, troops would just be required to patrol up to the patrolling points. Over time, as infrastructure, resources and troop capability improved and increased, the patrolling points were revised. The concept of patrol points came about well before India officially accepted the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Patrolling points give a more realistic on–ground guide of India&#x27;s limits of actual control.

Most patrolling points are close to the LAC. However, in the Depsang plains, the patrolling points are said to remain well inside in LAC, despite having been revised a number of times. Former Army officers have said that patrolling points provide a better on-the-ground picture of India&#x27;s limits of control. Based on location, the periodicity of visiting patrolling points can vary greatly from a few weeks to a couple of months. In some cases, the patrolling points are well-known landmarks such as mountain peaks or passes. In other cases, the pattrolling points are numbered, PP-1, PP-2 etc. There are over 65 patrolling points stretching from the Karakoram to Chumar.

The patrolling points within the LAC and the patrol routes that join them are known as &#x27;limits of patrolling&#x27;. Some army officers call this the &quot;LAC within the LAC&quot; or the actual LAC. The various patrol routes to the limits of patrolling are called the &#x27;lines of patrolling&#x27;.

During the 2020 China–India skirmishes, the patrolling points under dispute included PPs 10 to 13, 14, 15, 17, and 17A. On 18 September 2020, an article in &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote that &quot;since April, Indian troops have been denied access to PPs numbered 9, 10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 14, 15, 17, 17A.&quot;

=== List of numbered patrol points ===

India has 65 patrolling points in Eastern Ladakh, from Karakoram Pass to Chumar. Patrolling points are not the limits of Indian claim, because Indian claim extends beyond these patrolling points. These patrolling points were set by India as the patrolling limits for the Indian Army to patrol and avoid confrontation with the PLA to maintain peace on LAC with China, which had proved to be a superior military power in 1962 border war. According to a 2020 report by an Indian police officer, India lost access to 26 of 65 patrolling points (PP 5–17 in Depsang Plains &amp; Depsang Bulge including Samar Lungpa &amp; Galwan, 24-32 in Changchenmo basin, 37 in Skakjung pasture, 51 &amp; 52 in Demchok &amp; Chardhing Nala, 62 in Chumar) in Ladakh due to being restricted by China. India&#x27;s opposition party Congress claims that the Narendra Modi-ruled government of India is covering up &quot;territorial setbacks&quot; in this area, while the ruling government has denied the charges as &quot;politically motivated&quot;.

Listed by the mountain ranges.

* Karakoram range: two important subranges in disputed area are Changchenmo Range and Pangong Range as below.
** Changchenmo Range - a subrange of Karakoram range.
*** PP1 to PP3 — near the Karakoram Pass
*** PP4 to PP9 — in Depsang plains.
*** PP10 to PP13 including PP11A — in the Depsang Bulge from Y-Junction to Raki Nala (PP10), Y-Junction to Jivan Nala (PP13), and in between these two.
*** PP14 — in Galwan Valley, a mutually agreed before zone has been created due to which India is unable to access this PP.
*** PP15 — on the watershed between Kugrang and Galwan basins (called Jianan Pass by China).
*** PP16, PP17 and PP17A — Kugrang River Valley, the last near Gogra
*** PP18 to PP23 — southeast of Gogra, from the Silung Barma (Chang Chenmo River tributary) towards Pangong Tso
** Pangong Range, a sub range of Karakoram Range, runs from Chushul along southern shore of Panggong Tso on India-China LAC.
*** PP24 to PP?
* Kailash Range
** PP35 to PP37 — in Skakjung pasture &amp; near China-administered Dumchele. There have been several incursions by the China in this area. Due to the different perception of the border India and China and continuing Chinese incursions in Chushul, Chumur, Dungti, Phobrang, and Demchok has adversely affected the life of local Changpa nomadic herders.
* Demchok sector: Demchok and Chardhing Nala
** PP 38 to ?.
* Chumar Range: 
** PP61? in Nilung Nala.
** PP 62 to 65 in Chumar sector.

<doc id="615617" wikidata="Q913145" url="?curid=615617" title="Hemerocallidoideae">
<text>Hemerocallidoideae is a subfamily of flowering plants, part of the family Asphodelaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; in the monocot order Asparagales according to the APG system of 2016. Earlier classification systems treated the group as a separate family, the Hemerocallidaceae. The name is derived from the generic name of the type genus, &quot;Hemerocallis&quot;. The largest genera in the group are &quot;Dianella&quot; (with 20 species), &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; (15), and &quot;Caesia&quot; (11).

In the 21st century, the group has had two basic forms, depending on whether &quot;Johnsonia&quot; and its relatives are included or not. Each of these forms can vary by the inclusion or exclusion of &quot;Xeronema&quot;. If defined narrowly, most of the group are native to tropical and temperate Eurasia and Australia. They also occur in New Zealand, many Pacific islands, western South America, and Madagascar, but not in Sub-Saharan Africa or North America. If defined broadly, then the group includes the genus &quot;Caesia&quot;, which is indigenous to Southern Africa, as well as Australia.

The APG III system of 2009 used the broader definition of the group, treating it as the subfamily Hemerocallidoideae of the family Xanthorrhoeaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. In the APG IV system of 2016 the name Asphodelaceae is used in preference to Xanthorrhoeaceae.

&quot;Hemerocallis fulva&quot; is a common ornamental. Other species of &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; are cultivated as well. &quot;Hemerocallis citrina&quot; has medicinal uses. &quot;Phormium tenax&quot; is a traditional source of fiber in New Zealand.


==Circumscription==
Some of the older systems included &quot;Xeronema&quot; in Hemerocallidaceae, but with considerable doubt about whether it really belonged there. Molecular phylogenetic studies of DNA sequences have shown that &quot;Xeronema&quot; is sister to a clade consisting of Asphodelaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, Amaryllidaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;, and Asparagaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. &quot;Xeronema&quot; is now placed in its own family, Xeronemataceae.

In 1985, Dahlgren, Clifford, and Yeo produced a work on monocot taxonomy that remained influential for over two decades. They defined Hemerocallidaceae as consisting only of &quot;Hemerocallis&quot;. They excluded &quot;Phormium&quot; and its relatives, placing them into a separate family, Phormiaceae. This treatment was followed by Armen Takhtajan in 2009, in a classification that was based almost entirely on morphology and that recognized paraphyletic groups. It was not followed in a major work on monocot taxonomy which appeared in 1998.

In the 21st century, Hemerocallidaceae has been defined in essentially two different ways in systems based on monophyletic groups. In the narrower of these circumscriptions, Hemerocallidaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, it consists of 12 genera and 40 to 50 species. It does not include the 8 genera and about 38 species that are placed in a separate family, Johnsoniaceae.

The broader version of the family, Hemerocallidaceae sensu lato, includes those species that would otherwise be assigned to Johnsoniaceae. Johnsoniaceae and Hemerocallidaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; form a clade that has strong statistical support. One study found Johnsoniaceae to be embedded in Hemerocallidaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, but this result did not have strong bootstrap support.

The broader version of Hemerocallidaceae is the one that was accepted by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group when they published the APG II system in 2003. When this system was superseded by APG III in 2009, Hemerocallidaceae was not recognized, instead being treated as subfamily Hemerocallidoideae of the expanded family Xanthorrhoeaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. In the APG IV system of 2016 the name Asphodelaceae is used in preference to Xanthorrhoeaceae.

For a phylogeny of Hemerocallidaceae, see the phylogenetic tree at Asphodelaceae.

==Genera==
As noted above, a broad circumscription of the group includes the two former families Hemerocallidaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; and Johnsoniaceae. The Kubitzki system of 1998 has 12 genera (not counting &quot;Xeronema&quot;) in Hemerocallidaceae and eight genera in Johnsoniaceae. Some authors combine some of the more closely related genera, recognizing as few as three genera in Hemerocallidaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; and as few as one in Johnsoniaceae. The genera listed below are from the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, which recognizes 19 genera, with the placement in the subfamily based on APWeb .

<doc id="615625" wikidata="Q723138" url="?curid=615625" title="1998 Greater London Authority referendum">
<text>The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum was held in Greater London on 7 May 1998, asking whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority, composed of a directly elected Mayor of London and a London Assembly to scrutinise the Mayor&#x27;s actions. Voter turnout was low, at just 34.1%. The referendum was held under the Greater London Authority (Referendum) Act 1998 provisions.

==Referendum question==
The question that appeared on ballot papers in the referendum before the electorate was:

permitting a simple YES or NO answer.

==Result==


===Results by borough===

The &#x27;Yes&#x27; vote won in every London Borough, though support was generally larger in Inner London than in Outer London. The lowest support figures were 60.5% in Havering and 57.1% in Bromley; the greatest were 83.8% in Haringey and 81.8% in Lambeth. The income level of boroughs was an even greater factor affecting the outcome.

==Aftermath==

The government passed the Greater London Authority Act 1999, creating the Greater London Authority. Elections for the Mayor of London and the London Assembly were held in May 2000.

<doc id="615626" wikidata="Q767448" url="?curid=615626" title="Xanthorrhoea">
<text>Xanthorrhoea () is a genus of about 30 species of succulent flowering plants in the family Asphodelaceae. They are endemic to Australia. Common names for the plants include grasstree, grass gum-tree (for resin-yielding species), kangaroo tail, balga (Western Australia), yakka (South Australia), yamina (Tasmania), and black boy (or &quot;blackboy&quot;). The most common species is &quot;Xanthorrhoea australis&quot;, and some of these names are applied specifically to this species.

==Description==

All species in the genus are perennials and have a secondary thickening meristem in the stem. Many, but not all, species develop an above ground stem. The stem may take up to twenty years to emerge. Plants begin as a crown of rigid grass-like leaves, the caudex slowly growing beneath. The main stem or branches continue to develop beneath the crown. This is rough-surfaced, built from accumulated leaf-bases around the secondarily thickened trunk. The trunk is sometimes unbranched, some species will branch if the growing point is damaged, and others naturally grow numerous branches.

Flowers are borne on a long spike above a bare section called a scape; the total length can be over three to four metres long in some species. Flowering occurs in a distinct period, which varies for each species, and often stimulated by bushfire. Fires will burn the leaves and blacken the trunk, but the plant survives as the dead leaves around the stem serve as insulation against the heat of a wildfire. Many Xanthorrhoeas bloom for the first time when they are one-hundred or more years of age.

The rate of growth of &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; is slow. Some species grow slowly ( in height per year), but increase their rate of growth in response to season and rainfall.
After the initial establishment phase, the rate of growth varies widely from species to species. Thus, while a member of the fastest-growing &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; may be 200 years old, a member of a more slowly growing species of equal height may have aged to 600 years.

==Systematics==
===Taxonomy===
&quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; is part of the family Asphodelaceae, containing related genera such as &quot;Aloe&quot;, &quot;Alstroemeria&quot;, &quot;Gasteria&quot;, &quot;Haworthia&quot; and &quot;Hemerocallis&quot; (to name a few), but is placed within its own monotypic subfamily, the Xanthorrhoeoideae. The Xanthorrhoeoideae are monocots, part of the greater order of Asparagales.

A reference to its yellow resin, &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; literally means &quot;yellow-flow&quot; in Ancient Greek. Smith named it, in 1798, from &#x27; (&#x27;yellow, golden&#x27;) and &#x27; (&#x27;flowing, flow&#x27;). The invalid &quot;Acoroides&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Acorus&quot;-like&#x27;) was a temporary designation in Solander&#x27;s manuscript from his voyage with Cook, originally not meant for publication.

&quot;Kingia&quot; and &quot;Dasypogon&quot; are unrelated Australian plants with a similar growth habit to &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot;. Both genera have, at times, been confused with xanthorrhoeas and misnamed as &quot;grasstrees&quot;. Some plant classification systems, such as Cronquist, have included a wide range of other genera in the same family as &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot;. However, future anatomical and phylogenetic research supported the views of Dahlgren, whom regarded &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; as the sole taxon of the family Xanthorrhoeaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;, which is now treated as a subfamily, Xanthorrhoeoideae.

===Names===

Common names for &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; include grasstree, grass gum-tree (for its resin-yielding species), and kangaroo tail. The name grasstree is applied to many other plants. They are also known as balga grass plants, which derives from the word &quot;balga&quot; in the Noongar language of south-west of Western Australia, particularly for &quot;X. preissii&quot;. Its meaning is &quot;black boy&quot; or &quot;blackboy&quot;, a name which was applied to the plant for many years. Some thought that Aboriginal peoples used the name balga because the trunk blackened after a bushfire resembles a child-like black figure. The name is now seen as racist, and &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; are more commonly known as grass tree. However a 2015 report written by Aboriginal Tasmanian authors, who refer to the plant as &quot;yamina&quot;, says &quot;yamina forest on lungtalanana is important to the community. yamina are also commonly known as black boys. They are called this because the plant has a thick black trunk&quot;. 

In South Australia, &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; is commonly known as &quot;yakka&quot;, also spelled &quot;yacca&quot; and &quot;yacka&quot;, a name probably from the Kaurna language (&quot;Yakko&quot;, or alternatively &quot;Kurru&quot;). The Ngarrindjeri name is &quot;Bukkup&quot;.

Some of the above names are applied specifically to &quot;Xanthorrhoea australis&quot;, the most common species.

== Diversity and distribution ==

The genus is endemic to Australia, occurring in all national states and territories. Some species have a restricted range, others are widely distributed.
According to the &quot;World Checklist of Selected Plant Families&quot;, the following species are accepted:

==Habitat==
Grasstrees grow in coastal heaths, and wet and dry forests of Australia. They are drought and frost tolerant. The grass tree mainly occurs in soils that are very free draining and consequently low in nutrients. It survives in the poorest soils, with a shallow root system, enabling it easily access nutrients from decaying litter, while storing all the food reserves in its stem.

==Ecology==
The grass tree has developed adaptations that help it better suit the environment where it occurs. If a fire breaks out, the grass tree has a special physiological adaptation called thermal insulation that helps protect the plant. The grass tree holds its thick, dead leaves around its stem which serves as insulation, and helps to protect the plant against the heat of the fire.

They need fire to clear away dead leaves and promote flowering, as these slow-growing trees were among the first flowering plants to evolve.
Grass trees have developed a structural adaptation which helps the grass tree take advantage of soil fertilized with ash after fire, producing a flowering stalk in the aftermath.

The grass tree forms a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi deep in its root system, wherein fungi live in a mutually beneficial relationship with the grass tree roots. The fungus increases the tree root&#x27;s access to water and nutrients and therefore increases tree growth especially in poor conditions. The grass tree also suffers from a condition known as phytophthora dieback. &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot; is a discrete soil borne pathogen that attacks and destroys vascular root systems, causing hosts to perish through lack of nutrients and water. It is spread through infected plants and the movement of contaminated soil and gravel. The leaves of the grass tree are hosts to another fungi, &quot;Pseudodactylaria xanthorrhoeae&quot;.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; may be cultivated, as seed is easily collected and germinated. While they do grow slowly, quite attractive plants with short trunks () and leaf crowns up to (to the top of the leaves) can be achieved in 10 years. The slow growth rate means that it can take 30 years to achieve a specimen with a significant trunk. Most &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; sold in nurseries are established plants taken from bushland. Nurseries charge high prices for the plants. However, there is a very low survival rate for nursery-purchased plants (mainly due to over watering), which may take several years to die. The most successful examples of transplanting have been where a substantial amount of soil, greater than , has been taken with the plants.

The genus &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot;, more commonly known as the grass tree, is an iconic plant that epitomizes the Australian bush in its ability to live in poor nutrient soils and respond to wildfire.

Commonly-grown species for the garden include &quot;Xanthorrhoea australis&quot;, &quot;X. malacophylla&quot;, and &quot;X. preissii&quot;.

== Uses ==
&quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; is important to the Aboriginal peoples. It is a highly-valued resource with many uses. The flowering spike may be utilised as the lightweight handle of a composite spear with a hardwood sharp shaft inserted into the end. It is also soaked in water and the nectar from the flowers gives a sweet-tasting drink.

In the bush the flowers could reveal directions, since flowers on the warmer, sunnier side – usually north – of the spike often open before the flowers on the cooler side facing away from the sun.

The resin from &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; plants is used in spear-making and is an invaluable adhesive for Aboriginal people, often used to patch up leaky coolamons (water containers) and even yidaki (didgeridoos). The dried flower stalk scape was also used to generate fire by the hand drill friction method.

On the Tasmanian island of lungtalanana, Aboriginal people use the leaves for weaving.

Resin collected from the plant was used in Australia until the mid-twentieth century for the following purposes:
*Burnt as an incense in churches
*A base component for a varnish used on furniture and in dwellings
*A polish and a coating used on metal surfaces including stoves, tin cans used for storing meat and brass instruments
*A component used in industrial processes, such as sizing paper, as well as making soap, perfumes, and early gramophone records

<text>Bořivoj (Boris) Čelovský (8 September 1923, in Ostrava-Heřmanice – 12 February 2008) was a Czech-Canadian historian, member of the post-1948 Czechoslovak political exile and former political adviser. He was mostly dealing with historical and contemporary reflections of the Czech-German relationships. 

== Biography ==
After finishing his secondary studies in Ostrava in 1942, Boris Čelovský was sent to Germany for compulsory labour. Later he was assigned to join the anti-aircraft service in Kiel where he saw many massive bombing campaigns of the Allies. After World War II he worked in the municipal archive in Opava and began to study law at the University of Prague. But a few years later, after the quickly forming communists took over the political power in Czechoslovakia in 1948, Čelovský escaped into exile, not willing to participate or passively linger on any kind of totality.

Čelovský got to various places during the exile, but Canada became his final second home country; there he is rather known as Boris Celovsky, a name that he used there, as the original was unpronounceable for English-speakers. He studied modern history at the University of Heidelberg and then at the Université de Montréal. His dissertation dealt with the Munich Agreement, still a &quot;hot&quot; theme at the time, and commenced both applausive as well as strictly negative reactions. After he had settled in Canada, he worked as a statistician for the Canadian government. At the same time, he cooperated with local counter-espionage, monitoring Czechoslovak agents in the country. Later he became an adviser of several Canadian politicians and in the 1970s he assisted the very successful election campaign of the New Democratic Party that later supported the government led by Pierre Trudeau in an unofficial coalition. Čelovský was the author of one of the most liberal immigration law of the time, under which Canada began to encourage a very large number of people from all over the world.

After the Velvet Revolution, when the communist regime in Czechoslovakia had been torn down, Čelovský moved back to Ostrava and started publishing plenty of books on various subjects (some of which were actually translated reprints of the books previously published in exile). He was known for his strongly anti-German opinions and a provoking style of presenting his ideas, yet still based on precise historical work. His books often escalated strong reactions, both positive and negative and initiated broad debates.

<doc id="615633" wikidata="Q644305" url="?curid=615633" title="Hillman Avenger">
<text>The Hillman Avenger is a five-passenger, front-engine, rear-drive B-segment/subcompact car, originally engineered and manufactured by the Rootes Group in the UK and marketed globally from 1970–1978 in two- or four-door sedan and five-door wagon body styles. 

As a completely new design, the Avenger was a conventional, straightforward and economical design – the sedan distinguished by its four-doors, chair-height seating, four-link coil rear suspension and unique, J-shaped or &quot;hockey stick&quot; taillights. 

The project was conceived in 1963; Design Director Roy Axe received his styling brief in 1965; and engineering began in 1966. The Avenger became one of the first automobiles to use computer-aided design (CAD) in the engineering of its unibody, and it was the one of the first cars to address growing safety requirements, featuring a rigid passenger compartment with a front crumple zone, strengthened windshield glass, and heavily padded instrument panel.

After its press introduction in Malta in early 1970, manufacture took place at the Rootes plant in Ryton-on-Dunsmore, England, near Coventry which had been renovated at a cost of £8M (£154M 2025) — with bodies and body panels shipped by train from the Linwood, Scotland and powertrains shipped from Stoke. Manufacture moved completely to Linwood in 1976.

Rootes marketed the Avenger for model years 1970–1975 soley under its Hillman brand, as the &quot;Hillman Avenger&quot;. After Rootes became a division of Chrysler Europe, the car was marketed for model years 1976–1978 as the Chrysler Avenger. After the sale of Chrysler Europe to PSA Peugeot Citroën it was marketed for model years 1979–1981 as the Talbot Avenger. 

The Avenger would ultimately spawn a host of global badge engineered variants, including prominently 
a North American variant marketed for model years 1971–1973, the [[#1971–1973: Plymouth Cricket|Plymouth Cricket]]; by Chrysler Brazil for 1971–1980 as the Dodge 1800 (notably in a two-door body style) and later as the Dodge Polara — by Volkswagen Argentina as the VW 1800.

Despite its conventional underpinnings, the Avenger was successful in motorsport, winning the 1971 Press-on-Regardless Rally (in &quot;Plymouth Cricket&quot; badging); winning the British Group 1 Rally Championship in 1975 and 1976 in Northern Ireland, winning the British Saloon Car Championship numerous times, and winning the 1976 Heatway Rally of New Zealand.

At its introduction, the Avenger&#x27;s success was considered crucial to Rootes, and by 1981, final UK production had reached 790,000. While the Avenger was one of the most popular British cars of the 1970s, by 2016 reportedly fewer than 260 remained in use in Britain.

== 1970: Hillman Avenger ==
Introduced in February 1970, the Avenger was significant as it was the first and last car to be developed by Rootes after the Chrysler takeover in 1967. Its styling used conventional three-box and two-box styling featuring an American-influenced &quot;Coke Bottle&quot; waistline and semi-fastback rear-end, later spawning a station wagon variant. 

The Avenger used conventional unibody construction and a 4-cylinder all-iron overhead valve engine in 1250 or 1500 capacities driving a coil spring suspended live axle at the rear wheels. The Avenger was praised by the press for its handling characteristics and overall road competence.
Initially, the Avenger was available as a four-door saloon in DL or Super trim levels with either the 1250 or 1500 cc engines, as well as a GL trim level with the 1500 cc engine. The DL featured rubber mat floor covering and a simple dashboard with a strip-style speedometer. The Super also featured carpets, armrests, twin horns reversing lights and dashboard carried from the DL. The GL trim featured four round headlights, internal bonnet release, two-speed wipers, brushed nylon seat trim (never previously used on British cars), reclining front seats, and round instruments in its dash along with extra instrumentation. During the first two years of production, only the car&#x27;s curb side featured the &quot;Avenger&quot; emblem, as a cost saving measure. 

In addition to its styling, its engine and transmission were purpose-designed exclusive to the Avenger. Its plastic front grille, a first in Britain and at wide was claimed as the largest mass-produced plastic component used at the time by a European car. The Avenger was a steady seller in the 1970s, in competition with the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Viva. Chrysler marketed the Avenger globally, prominently but unsuccessfully as the Plymouth Cricket in the U.S..

=== Body and trim variations ===

In October 1970, the Avenger GT was added to the range featuring a twin-carburettor 1500 cc engine, four-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission (also optional on the 1500 DL, Super and GL). The GT featured twin round headlights, door stripes and &quot;dustbin lid&quot; wheel covers, similar to on various 1970s Datsuns and Toyotas.

A basic fleet Avenger was added to the range in February 1972 with either 1250 or 1500 cc engines (the latter available with the automatic transmission option), only a driver sun visor and a single speed heater blower. In October 1972, the Avenger GT was replaced by the Avenger GLS, featuring a vinyl roof and Rostyle sports wheels.

In March 1972, the five-door estate versions were introduced, in DL and Super trim levels, both available with either 1250 or 1500 cc engines and using the same specifications as the saloon. The wagon featured &#x27;heavy-duty springing&#x27; with a maximum load capacity of , compared to for the saloon.
A two-door saloon model model was added in March 1973, with all engine and trim levels of the four-door range. 

The car was extensively marketed in continental Europe, first as a Sunbeam and as the Sunbeam 1250 and 1500 in France, later the 1300 and 1600. Some northern European markets marketed the car as the Sunbeam Avenger.

Both engine sizes were upgraded in October 1973. The 1250 became the 1300, while the 1500 became the 1600 with nearly all the same previous trim levels except for the basic fleet Avenger, which was discontinued at this point. The three speed automatic transmission was upgraded to four speeds with the Borg Warner 45 transmission replacing the earlier 35. The GL and GT trim levels were offered with the 1300 engine and two-door saloon body.

== 1972: Hillman Avenger Tiger ==

Named to evoke memories of the Sunbeam Tiger, the Avenger Tiger concept began as a publicity exercise. Avenger Super (four-door) cars were modified by the Chrysler Competitions Centre under Des O&#x27;Dell and the Tiger model was launched in March 1972. Modifications included the 1500 GT engine with an improved cylinder head with enlarged valves, twin Weber carburetors and a compression ratio of 9.4:1. The engine now developed at 6,100 rpm. The suspension was also uprated, whilst brakes, rear axle, and gearbox are directly from the GT.

A distinctive yellow colour scheme (&quot;Sundance&quot;) with a bonnet bulge, rear spoiler and side stripes was standard, set off with &quot;Avenger Tiger&quot; lettering on the rear quarters.

Road test figures demonstrated a 0–60 mph time of 8.9 seconds and a top speed of . These figures beat the rival Ford Escort Mexico, but fuel consumption was heavy. Even in 1972, the Tiger developed a reputation for its thirst.

All Avenger Tigers were assembled by the Chrysler Competitions Centre and production figures are vague but around 200 of the initial Mark 1 seems likely.

In October 1972, Chrysler unveiled the more production ready Mark 2 Tiger. The Avenger GL bodyshell with four round headlights was used. Mechanically identical to the earlier cars(from contemporary road tests, however, there were better performances and fuel consumption), the bonnet bulge was lost although the bonnet turned matt black, and there were changes to wheels and seats. These cars went on sale at £1,350. Production was around 400. Red (&quot;Wardance&quot;) was now available as well as yellow (&quot;Sundance&quot;), both with black detailing.
== 1976–1979: Chrysler Avenger ==
In September 1976, the Avenger was rebadged as a Chrysler. It also gained a comprehensive facelift which included a new frontal treatment and a new dashboard. Both treatments looked similar to those of the Chrysler Alpine. The greatest change was at the rear where, on the saloons, the distinctive &quot;hockey-stick&quot; rear lamp clusters were dropped in favour of a straight &quot;light-bar&quot; arrangement. The top of the former &quot;hockey-sticks&quot; had metal plates in their place, whilst the fuel cap was moved from the rear to the right hand side of the car.

Three trim levels were available, LS, GL (known as &#x27;Super&#x27; in certain markets) and GLS—the GLS being only available in a high-compression 1.6 L form.

From the beginning of production in 1970, the Avenger&#x27;s bodyshell components had been manufactured at Linwood, and then transported south to Ryton on the component trains used to move materials for the Hillman Imp north to Linwood. Following the Imp&#x27;s discontinuation in 1976, the Avenger production line was moved from Ryton to Linwood where it was produced until the end of its UK production life., whilst Ryton was switched over to producing the Simca-based Chrysler Alpine and later the Talbot Solara.
== 1977: Chrysler Sunbeam hatchback ==

In 1977, a hatchback variant was introduced, known as the Chrysler Sunbeam. This was based on a shortened version of the Avenger&#x27;s floorplan, and was intended to compete in the lower &quot;supermini&quot; class. It also shared doors with the 2-door Avenger. Initially three engines were available: a 928 cc Hillman Imp-derived unit and 1300 and 1600 Avenger units. A sporty &quot;Ti&quot; version was soon introduced, also with a 1600 engine.

The model&#x27;s name was a revival of the Rootes Sunbeam marque, which had recently been killed off along with the final Sunbeam model, the Rapier.

In 1979, Chrysler unveiled the Sunbeam Lotus at the Geneva Motor Show. Developed in conjunction with Lotus with rallying in mind (because none of the existing models were competitive) and using a 2200 cc Lotus engine, the road-going version of the rally car was not actually ready for delivery to the public until after the Peugeot buyout, and thus became the Talbot Sunbeam Lotus. At first, these were produced mostly in Lotus&#x27; then tobacco-sponsorship colours of black and silver, although later models came in a turquoise and silver scheme.

== 1979–1981: Talbot Avenger ==

Following the collapse of Chrysler Europe in 1978, and its takeover by PSA Peugeot Citroën, the Avenger was re-badged with the resurrected Talbot brand with the Avenger remaining in production alongside the hatchback-only Horizon to meet the demand which remained for traditional saloons and estates in this sector. Unlike newer Talbot models such as the Horizon, the Avenger retained the Chrysler &quot;Pentastar&quot; badge, instead of the Talbot logo featuring a letter &quot;T&quot; inside a circle – this was because Chrysler had retained the rights to the Avenger model after the sale of Chrysler Europe to PSA, who only had purchased the rights to the Simca-based Alpine and Horizon. The Sunbeam was afforded a minor facelift in Autumn 1980 with revised headlights and grille now featuring the round Talbot logo. Production continued until the middle of 1981, when PSA closed the Linwood production plant and concentrated all British production at the Ryton plant. The Avenger was discontinued with no direct replacement – the Peugeot 305, introduced in 1977, was the closest car to the Avenger&#x27;s size in PSA&#x27;s lineup; although the slightly larger Talbot Solara (a saloon version of the Alpine/Simca 1307) had been introduced shortly before the Avenger&#x27;s demise.

Chrysler retained ownership of the &quot;Avenger&quot; trademark, subsequently used on the Dodge Avenger 2007–2014. The name was also used on Jeep&#x27;s first electric model to be marketed in Australia in 2024

==1971–1973: Plymouth Cricket==
===Background===
Chrysler Corporation had repeatedly announced it would enter the North American small car market in the early 1970s to compete with Chevrolet Vega, Ford Pinto and AMC Gremlin, by developing and manufacturing its own domestic small car, known as its &quot;Project R-429&quot; — subsequently delaying the project again and again. 

In the meantime, having increased its ownership of Simca to 77% in 1963 and taken control of the Rootes Group by mid-1964, Chrysler had already marketed numerous Simca and Rootes models, e.g. the Simca 1204 and Sunbeam Arrow via a new Simca-Rootes Division, formed in 1966
— with 850 dealers selling four Simca models and 400 dealers selling four Rootes models. Results were dismal, and in late 1969, Chrysler announced it would henceforth market its Rootes and Simca products from its Chrysler-Plymouth Division.

===Debut===
Chrysler introduced a rebadged variant of the Hillman Avenger to the U.S. and Canadian market for model year 1971, as the &quot;Plymouth Cricket,&quot; via its Plymouth dealerships — as a 4-door saloon/sedan (and later, as a 5-door station wagon for MY 1972). The Cricket, and the Colt marketed simultaneously at Dodge dealerships, were both seen in the industry as stop-gap measures until Chrysler could design a small car to be manufactured domestically.

A Plymouth press release from June 30, 1970 announced a formal presentation of the Cricket in November 1970, with the first shipment of 280 Crickets arriving from the UK in the U.S. on 20 November 1970. Showroom sales began January 20, 1971. 

Where its Hillman antecedent had been marketed as the &quot;Avenger&quot;, i.e., someone who extracts revenge, the Cricket&#x27;s emblems featured a cartoonish font incorporating a flower, its marketing materials prominently featuring a cartoonish (cricket) mascot, using a &quot;The Little Car That Can, Chirp, Chirp&quot; tagline — recalling the light-hearted marketing of small cars common in the U.S., e.g., the Volkswagen Beetle, AMC Gremlin and, later, the Volkswagen Rabbit and Renault Le Car.

===Federalization===
To meet US DOT regulations, Rootes federalized the Avenger with the required side marker lamps, head restraints and round headlights — in both the USA and Canada, borrowed from the GL and GT model Avengers. The Cricket would subsequently receive a seat-belt warning light system (activated by a weight of 20lb or greater on a front seat) for 1972, as well as large rubber-tipped over-riders in compliance with bumper impact standards.

===Features===
Mechanical specifications included the Avenger&#x27;s 1500 cc engine with overhead cam shaft, rated at 70 gross horsepower, with its compression lowered from 9.2 to 8.0:1, a fully synchronized manual four-speed transmission, rack and pinion steering, 9.5&quot; front disc brakes and 8&quot; rear drums, radial tires, MacPherson front struts and a four-link rigid/live rear axle on coil springs; and front anti-roll bars. Mechanically, the Avenger was designed for ease of service. E.g., a mechanic could reach the oil drain plug standing next to the engine bay.

With a 1971 US base price of $1915, standard features included chair-height seating, pivoting front vent windows, rear windows that rolled down completely, flow-through ventilation with rear pillar extractors, recessed exterior door handles and flush interior door handles, radial tires, rubber mat passenger floor covering, spare tire mounted beneath the flat trunk floor, power front disc brakes, child proof rear door locks, 12.2 cu.ft. trunk capacity (variously reported as 14 cu.ft.), full-width dashboard padding, two-speed fan for flow through ventilation with upper level dash vents, impact absorbing steering wheel, horn control mounted at the end of the turn signal lever, electro-dip anti-corrosion treatment, acrylic enamel paint over two primer layers in nine colors, bolt-on front fenders and a 31.75 foot turning radius.

Optional equipment included a three-speed automatic transmission ($178), air conditioning ($338), fully transistorized AM radio, flush retracting fender-mounted antenna, white sidewall tires, twin carburetor and a &quot;Decor Package&quot; which included dual horns, center console with rear ash tray,glove box light and lock, cigarette lighter, oil pressure and the alternator gauges, front door storage pockets, day/night adjustable mirror, rear seat arm rests, color-keyed carpeting, window chrome moldings, dual paint stripes on the sides, bumper guards, wheel covers, courtesy lights, dimmable instrument panel lighting, rear door courtesy light switch and upgraded upholstery available in five colors: blue, olive, tan, vellum and black. From 1972, the single carburetor / automatic choke combination, dual carburetors, and air conditioning were optional.

===Wagon===
A press release on 23 February 1972 announced a station wagon, to be introduced in early spring, 1972, with its formal introduction at the 1972 Chicago Auto Show. 

Station wagons featured a 70bhp (8.5:1 compression ratio) engine with dual carburetors; three configurations for the rear seat (seating, loading or extended to an 80&quot; long &quot;sleeping&quot; mode); counterbalanced rear tailgate; 24&quot; liftover height; 60 cu ft capacity; and an overall length 4&quot; greater than the sedans; The wagons spare wheel was mounted under the rear load floor, outside the car, lowerable by a provided hexnut.

===Annual updates===
For model year 1971, an optional twin carburetor became available, the four-cylinder engine added 15 horsepower on August 23, 1971, and the standard engine was given an automatic choke. 

The Cricket survived for two full model years: 1971-1972. Chrysler appeared to market a Cricket for MY 1973, going so far as to publish marketing materials for MY1973 Crickets, but in fact none were imported after January 1, 1973 — and despite selling the vehicles after that as 1973 models, they carried 1972 MY vehicle identification numbers (VINs).

===Sales and Reception===
Despite its market strengths (multi-link rear suspension, strong ride and handling, four-door configuration, standard radial tires, chair-height seating, flow through ventilation, safety innovations and economical performance — in many regards on par with its Beetle/Vega/Pinto/Gremlin competitors — the Cricket&#x27;s reliability and dealer network became points of criticism. It languished in the market, with sales reaching approximately 41,000 over its two full years on the market, roughly half its projected sales. For model year 1971, Plymouth had sold 27,682 Crickets when Chevrolet had sold 275,000 Vegas and Ford, 352,000 Pintos. For 1972 (and 1973), 13,882 were sold.

With slow sales and stiff competition, re-engineering the Cricket to meet 1974 U.S. safety, bumper and emissions standards seemed like a poor investment. The Cricket was effectively discontinued after Plymouth dealers sold the last remaining 1972 models, shortly into Calendar Year 1973 — just prior to the gas crisis of 1973, which resulted in a sharp increase in demand for economical cars. Having reduced its economical offerings, Chrysler&#x27;s sales plummeted and the company had lost a record $170 million by 1974.

In retrospect, Chrysler had poorly prepared the Cricket for the US market. Though advertising that the Cricket had undergone millions of miles in testing from cold-weather testing in Norway to hot-weather testing in Spain, Chrysler began marketing the Cricket in the U.S. before testing on American roads, in harsh American climates. In its December 1970 issue, Car and Driver tested the Cricket, with the reviewer left stranded roadside. Consumer Reports did not give the Cricket a &quot;good&quot; rating, recommending a Plymouth Valiant instead. Weaknesses included the Stromberg fuel system and Lucas electricals; a design decision to replace underseal with electrolysed paint, resulting in corrosion issues; and an MSRP very close to the Plymouth Dart/Valiant MSRP.

Chrysler complicated matters for the Cricket, in its dealership arrangements. In 1966, the corporation had set up a separate &quot;Simca-Rootes Division&quot; with its own dealership to exclusively handle the Simca 1204 and any products imported from Rootes. Chrysler subsequently withheld the Cricket from these dealerships, arguing it was not a Rootes product. The dealerships accused Chrysler of &quot;surreptitiously&quot;
 changing the name of the &quot;Rootes Group&quot; to &quot;Chrysler UK&quot; in 1970 in its dealer agreements. At a time when the concepts of captive imports and badge engineering were new, the &quot;Simca-Rootes&quot; dealers had to argue in court that the Cricket was in fact a Rootes product. A judge found that Chrysler in fact had to supply these dealerships with the Cricket, as Plymouth, no less. Subsequently Chrysler dissolved its Simca-Rootes Division and began marketing its captive imports only through its Plymouth Dealershiops. Confusingly, for model year 1971, Chrysler continued to market the Simca 1204 via its Plymouth Dealerships — concurrently with the Cricket.

Furthermore, at the same time Chrysler marketed its captives imports, Chrysler executives denounced the very concept of subcompact cars, Chrysler&#x27;s Chairman, Lynn Townsend saying &quot;the subcompacts are just too small, the American people won&#x27;t climb into them. They have to give up too much in creature comfort.&quot; Chrysler would later enter the US small car market in earnest in 1978 with its Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon twins.

===Cricket nameplate in Canada===
The Cricket nameplate continued in Canada, when Chrysler Canada replaced the rebadged British-built Avenger with a rebadged Mitsubishi engineered and manufactured Dodge Colt in mid-1973 model year. The GT variant was marketed as the &quot;Plymouth Cricket Formula S.&quot; For model year 1975 this Canadian Plymouth Cricket was rebadged as the Plymouth Colt. Thus began Chrysler&#x27;s marketing system for the Colt in Canada: selling the Colt as both a Dodge and a Plymouth. 
==International production==
Chrysler&#x27;s global operations marketed the Avenger, in some cases, assembled the Avenger. In South Africa, as with the larger Hunter assembled there, the Avenger used Peugeot engines and was badged as a Dodge rather than a Hillman, while in New Zealand the car, assembled from CKD kits by importer Todd Motors (later Mitsubishi Motors NZ), was available initially in 4-door and, later, 5-door estate forms.

===Denmark and Europe===
In Denmark, the versions being sold were:
* 1300 (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)
* 1300 GL (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)
* 1600 GL (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)
* 1600 GLS (4-door saloon, 5-door estate car)
* 1600 GT (2-door saloon, 4-door saloon)

These Danish versions had two-door equivalents which were sometimes exported back to the UK, since two-door models were phased out in the UK market in 1979. The Hillman Avenger name was not used, instead the cars were simply badged as Sunbeam and the engine size and trim level (e.g. Sunbeam 1600 GLS).

Throughout most of Europe the Sunbeam name was used, except for the Netherlands, Italy and Spain.

===Argentina===


The Avenger was built in Argentina between 1971 and 1990, initially as the Dodge 1500 (or Dodge 1500M with the 1.8 engine) as a four-door sedan.

In 1977, the Dodge 1500 GT-100 producing was introduced. It had the 1800 engine, two Stromberg carburettors, a diameter clutch and a high performance manifold. This model could be had only in dark blue or black with obligatory sports stripes. In 1978, the first station wagon (estate version)–Dodge 1500 Rural–were announced. Later on, the Rural was only available with the 1.8 liter engine, albeit still using the &quot;1500&quot; name.

In the beginning of 1980 Volkswagen acquired Chrysler International&#x27;s remaining shares in their Argentinian subsidiary when the latter withdrew from South America (Volkswagen held 49% since earlier). The deal included the tooling to the Dodge 1500. The Chrysler range was discontinued, but the Dodge 1500 continued with a new &quot;Serie W&quot; suffix. In 1982 the car was renamed the Volkswagen 1500 (not to be confused with the totally different Volkswagen Type 3, which had been sold elsewhere in the world between 1961 and 1973 as a Volkswagen 1500 too).

Under Volkswagen, the car received its final facelift, gaining a sloping front grille which was more in vogue in the early 1980s. Details such as the rearview mirrors and doorhandles were replaced by squared-off units in black plastic, rather than the earlier chromed filigrane ones. Production ended in 1990, replaced with the more modern Volkswagen Gacel/Senda, with a total of 262,668 units sold in its almost 20-year lifespan. This vehicle was very popular with taxi drivers, but by the end of 1998 they had all fallen foul of the ten-year age rule on Argentine taxi vehicles. It was also very popular in the early TC 2000 touring car racing series, winning the 1980, 1981 and 1982 championships.

===Brazil===

The Avenger was also built in Brazil from 1973 until 1981 in two-door sedan form only, sold initially as Dodge 1800, named for its motor — the engine design was the same as found in Avengers sold elsewhere, although enlarged to a 1.8 L capacity. Styling was completely different from the British built Avengers (which only arrived four months later), with the bodywork from the A-pillar back being unique. The differences are very small, with the rear side window being somewhat larger and the overall appearance being slightly less curvy than the British model. More obvious is the use of larger bumpers, a four-headlamp grille (which was different from the design found on the quadruple headlamp Avengers and the American Plymouth Cricket), and conventional tail lights, which did not have the &quot;hockeystick&quot; shape of the Hillman Avenger. It was presented at the São Paulo Motor Show in November 1972.

In 1976, the car was renamed Dodge Polara (a nameplate Chrysler previously used on full-sized Dodge models in the U.S. and on a series of large Dodges in Argentina), and underwent a comprehensive facelift (in 1978), gaining the Chrysler Avenger&#x27;s front styling, and dashboard setup, the revised bumpers and tail light treatments remaining unique to Brazil. A further light facelift was given in 1980 before production ceased in 1981.

===New Zealand===
The Avenger was sold by Todd Motors in New Zealand from 1970–1980 in four-door sedan and five-door wagon (1975 onward) forms only. Todd&#x27;s of Petone and, later, Porirua also sold Chrysler Australia and Mitsubishi products and their assembly lines both at the original Petone plant (dating from the mid-1930s) and the new purpose-built plant opened in Porirua in 1974 were notable for the variety of models coming down the twin final assembly lines at any one time—vehicles sharing the trim lines with the Avenger on a daily shift might include the Hillman Hunter, Chrysler Valiant and Alpine hatchback, Mitsubishi Galant, Mirage and Lancer, as well as the Datsun 180B (due to Todd Motors for a time having a contract to build those as Nissan&#x27;s other contractor at the time, Campbell Motor Industries, did not have enough capacity).

The New Zealand Avenger initially was similar to the British line but there was just one engine and trim level to start: the &#x27;Super&#x27; (two headlights, vinyl trim, 1.5 L single carburettor engine, manual 4-speed gearbox.). In 1971 Todd&#x27;s added a unique-to-NZ, sporty, 1.5-litre twin-carburettor &#x27;TC&#x27; model with all-black interior trim, dashtop rev counter, side striping, high-back &#x27;tombstone&#x27; front seats, special bright paint colours and new wheel trims, among other detail changes. This was loosely based on the UK GT but lacked that car&#x27;s &#x27;Rostyle&#x27; wheels, using locally-made, look-alike pressed aluminium wheel trims instead.

The TC was effectively replaced in 1973 by the more upmarket Avenger Alpine, another local special loosely based on the UK &#x27;GL&#x27; (four headlights, four-round-dials dashboard instead of a rectangular instrument cluster (though early cars had a blanked-off space instead of the rev counter standardised later), better trim, twin carburettors and vinyl roof), initially with the twin-carburettor 1.5 L engine (changed to a 1.6 L from 1973, later changed again to a single-carb unit and also available for the first time with automatic transmission, the Borg Warner 45 four-speed unit). The Super sedan also gained the 1.6 L engine and auto option in &#x27;73 while the range was expanded in 1975 when 1.3 L variants (a result of the fuel crisis that also prompted rival Ford New Zealand to reintroduce a Cortina 1.3) and 1.6 L manual or automatic &#x27;Super&#x27; wagon models were added to the New Zealand assembled range.

Todd&#x27;s updated its Avenger line in 1978 with the Simca-style front end and dashboard and new tail lights, and added a luxury GLS version, similar to the UK model, in place of the earlier Alpine while the range was rebranded Chrysler Avenger. It again broadly followed the British lineup, albeit with a limited range of models, now consisting of a 1.3 GL sedan, a 1.6 LS wagon (marketed as Avenger Estate) and 1.6 GLS sedans, again with manual or automatic transmissions. The &#x27;base&#x27; 1.3 GL sedan was a very popular entry level B-category model for rental car company Avis right up to the Avenger&#x27;s demise in 1980.

While Avenger models in Europe were rebranded as Talbot, the New Zealand Avengers kept the Chrysler branding for 1980. 1980 models could be identified by a black grille, protective black body-side mouldings, window blackouts and unadorned steel wheels.

A variant unique to New Zealand, available for some years, was a vanbasically the manual Avenger wagon with a flat rear floor in place of rear seats and fixed, rather than wind-down, rear door windows. This, and rival models, were introduced around 1975 to get around New Zealand&#x27;s strict oil crisis hire purchase laws that required a 60 per cent deposit for a new car with only 12-month terms, versus 25 per cent and three years for a light commercial vehicle.

All New Zealand Avengers from 1973 onwards had metric instruments.

Along with the 1971–1979 Vauxhall HC Viva, 1968-72 FD Victors, and 1976–1981 Vauxhall Chevette ranges, and Austin Allegro, Maxi and Princess, the Avenger was one of several British models to be sold in New Zealand but not Australia. The Avenger was planned initially as a Hillman Hunter replacement for Australia but, due to economics of sourcing, the Japanese Mitsubishi Galant was chosen instead by Chrysler Australia for that market, though it was marketed as the &#x27;Chrysler Galant&#x27;. By contrast in New Zealand, the Avenger, Hunter and Mitsubishi Galant (offered from 1972–1977 in coupe form only) co-existed together in Todd Motors&#x27; overall lineup, though the Avenger-sized (but much more cramped inside) Mitsubishi Lancer eventually went into local assembly in 1975.

===South Africa===
The Avenger was assembled and sold in South Africa badged as the Dodge Avenger. To satisfy local content rules a locally made 1.6 L Peugeot engine, shared with the locally assembled Peugeot 404, was used. The Avenger was available from 1975 until its discontinuation in 1976, when it was renamed as a Chrysler. After &quot;Chrysler ZA&quot; was merged into Sigma Motor Corporation in 1976, the Avenger was soon cancelled to allow &quot;SIGMA&quot; to free up more production capacity for the Mazda 323.

===Iran===
The Avenger was built in Iran from 1978–1980 in two-door, form by Iran Khodro Co. and called the Hillman Avenger aside the locally manufactured Hillman Hunter (called Paykan). The engine used in it was the Hunter engine also used in the Paykan. The 4-door Avenger was imported to Iran for a few years starting in 1975.

===Uruguay===
An Avenger-based coupe utility (pickup) called the Dodge 1500 Pickup was made in Uruguay, but the conversion failed to properly account for structural rigidity and they literally broke apart.

<text>Maxwell House is an American brand of coffee manufactured by a like-named division of Kraft Heinz in North America and JDE Peet&#x27;s in the rest of the world. Introduced in 1892 by wholesale grocer Joel Owsley Cheek, it was named in honor of the Maxwell House Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee, which was its first major customer. For nearly 100 years, until the late 1980s, it was the highest-selling coffee brand in the United States. The company&#x27;s slogan is &quot;Good to the last drop,&quot; which is often incorporated into its logo and is printed on its labels.

Maxwell House coffee has been owned and produced by several companies, starting with Cheek&#x27;s company, Nashville Coffee and Manufacturing Company, then followed by General Foods and Kraft Foods Inc.

== History ==
=== Early origins ===
In 1884, Joel Cheek moved to Nashville and met Roger Nolley Smith, a British coffee broker. He was said to be able to tell the origin of a coffee simply by smelling the green beans. Over the next few years, the two worked on finding the perfect blend. In 1892, Cheek approached the food buyer for the Maxwell House Hotel and gave him 20 pounds of his special blend for free. After a few days, the coffee was gone, and the hotel returned to using its usual brand. But after hearing complaints from patrons and others who liked Cheek&#x27;s coffee better, the hotel bought Cheek&#x27;s blend exclusively. After six months, the hotel agreed to allow Cheek to name his coffee after his first big sale.

Inspired by his success, Cheek resigned from his job as a coffee broker and, with partner Maxwell Colbourne, formed a wholesale grocery distributor known as the &quot;Nashville Coffee and Manufacturing Company&quot;. They specialized in coffee, with &quot;Maxwell House Coffee&quot;, as it came to be known, as the central brand. Later, the Nashville Coffee and Manufacturing Company was renamed as the &quot;Cheek-Neal Coffee Company&quot;. Over the next several years, the Maxwell House Coffee brand became a well-respected name that set it apart from the competition.

=== &quot;Good to the last drop&quot; ===

In 1915, Cheek-Neal began using a &quot;Good to the last drop&quot; slogan to advertise their Maxwell House Coffee. For several years, the ads made no claim of Theodore Roosevelt being the originator of the phrase. The company was then sold to General Foods which took over the Maxwell House brand in 1925. By the 1930s, the company was running advertisements that claimed that the former president had taken a sip of Maxwell House Coffee on a visit to Andrew Jackson&#x27;s estate, The Hermitage, near Nashville on October 21, 1907, and when served the coffee, he proclaimed it to be &quot;good to the last drop&quot;. During this time, Coca-Cola also used the slogan &quot;Good to the last drop&quot;. Later, Maxwell House distanced itself from that 1930s advertising claim, admitting that the slogan was written by Clifford Spiller, former president of General Foods Corporation, and did not come from a Roosevelt remark overheard by Cheek-Neal. The phrase remains a registered trademark of the product and appears on its logo.

The veracity of the Roosevelt connection to the phrase has never been historically established. In the local press coverage of Roosevelt&#x27;s October 21 visit, a story concerning Roosevelt and the cup of coffee he drank features a quote that does not resemble the slogan. He is quoted as saying: &quot;This is the kind of stuff I like to drink, by George, when I hunt bears.&quot; The Maxwell House Company claimed in its advertising that the Roosevelt story was true. In 2009, Maxwell House ran a commercial featuring Roosevelt repriser Joe Wiegand, who tells the &quot;Last Drop&quot; story.

=== Expansion of the product line ===

In 1942 during World War II, General Foods Corporation, successor to the Postum Company established by Charles William Post, contracted to supply instant coffee to the U.S. armed forces. Beginning in the fall of 1945, this product, which by that time had come to be branded as Maxwell House Instant Coffee, entered test markets in the eastern U.S.; it began national distribution the following year

The Yuban brand (sometimes Yule brand) was John Arbuckle″s name for his personal mix of fresh coffees for Christmas gifts.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEAFtv/yuban&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, Arbuckle Brothers Company, the first merchant to sell packaged coffee, was merged with &quot;Maxwell House&quot;, later, General Foods.

From 1949 until 2015, Yuban brand coffee was made in San Leandro, California, with Arabica and Robusta,&lt;ref name=&quot;trung-nguyen-online/yuban-coffee&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while Maxwell House brand coffee only uses Arabica,&lt;ref name=&quot;taypresso/maxwell-v-yuban&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1988-04-11-fi-734&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, The New York Times noted it was available only on the West Coast, and was among the top three of thirteen that &quot;were the richest and most full-bodied&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1984/sampling-brands-plain-fancy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 the company introduced &quot;Maxwell House ElectraPerk&quot;, developed specifically for electric percolators.

In 1969 General Foods in the UK launched granulated coffee in a presentation at the London Hilton hotel, using a pantomime stage format in a show called &quot;Once Upon a Coffee Time&quot;. In this story, the weak &quot;Prince of Powdah&quot; and his mentor &quot;Reschem&quot; travel the world in search of blends. Meeting and falling in love with &quot;Princess Purity&quot; and fighting the dragon &quot;Old Hat&quot;, the young man emerges as &quot;Prince Granulo&quot;, heir to the Kingdom of Maxwell. This show was written by Michael Ingrams, produced by the Mitchell Monkhouse Agency, and designed by Malcolm Lewis and Chris Miles of Media.

In 1976 General Foods added &quot;Maxwell House A.D.C.&quot; coffee, the name reflecting its intended use in automatic drip coffeemakers such as Mr. Coffee, which were superseding traditional coffee-preparation methods. In 1972, the company had introduced &quot;Max-Pax&quot; ground-coffee filter rings, aimed at the then still-strong market for percolator coffee preparation. Although this method, too, has been eclipsed, the Max-Pax concept was subsequently adapted as Maxwell House Filter Packs, first marketed by this name in 1989, for use in automatic coffee makers. By the 1990s, the company had quietly discontinued formulations for specific preparation methods.

The brand is now marketed in ground and measured forms, as well as in whole-bean, flavored, and varietal blends. A higher-yield ground coffee, Maxwell House Master Blend, was introduced in 1981. Rich French Roast; Colombian Supreme, described as being 100% Colombian coffee; and 1892, described as a slow-roasted formulation, were all brought out in 1989, to compete in the increasingly competitive coffee market. In 1992, the company added cappuccino products to its line with Cappio Iced Cappuccino and Maxwell House Cappuccino in 1993. In recent years, the names of these products have been modified by the company to present a more uniform Maxwell House brand image.

After Kraft Foods Inc. was split into two companies in 2012, the rights to the Maxwell House brands were divided and are currently owned by Kraft Heinz in North America and JDE Peet&#x27;s (formed from merger of Douwe Egberts and Mondelez International coffee and tea division) in the rest of the world.

=== Decaffeinated coffee ===
General Foods marketed decaffeinated coffee under various brand names such as Sanka from 1927, and Brim and Maxim, the latter a freeze-dried instant coffee which is not decaffeinated, from the 1950s. But it refrained from selling Maxwell House-labeled decaffeinated coffee products until 1983, when it introduced ground Maxwell House Decaffeinated into East Coast markets.

General Foods... through its Maxwell House division, entered 1984 with the West Coast introduction of Yuban ground decaffeinated coffee, followed by the national rollout of Maxwell House decaffeinated&lt;ref name=&quot;thefreelibrary/a03841993&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, it introduced a decaffeinated version of its long-established, lighter-tasting Yuban brand on the West Coast. Maxwell House Instant Decaffeinated Coffee came to store shelves in 1985. A further modification of the decaf theme, Maxwell House Lite, a reduced-caffeine blend, was introduced nationally in 1992 by Kraft General Foods and in its instant form the following year.

== Advertising ==
===1920s advertising campaign===
During the 1920s, the Maxwell House brand began to be extensively advertised across the US. Total advertising expenditures rose from $19,955 in 1921 to $276,894 in 1924. The brand was cited as the most well-known coffee brand in a 1925 study of consumer goods.

===Radio===
Maxwell House was the sponsor of &quot;Maxwell House Coffee Time&quot;, which ran from 1937 to 1949 and featured Baby Snooks (a character portrayed by Fanny Brice), Charles Ruggles, Frank Morgan, Topper, and George Burns and Gracie Allen over the years in a predominately radio comedy and variety format. Maxwell House also sponsored &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; series on radio and later on television.

Maxwell House was also the sponsor of the radio version of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;. Each episode began with the youngest daughter asking, &quot;Mother, is Maxwell House really the best coffee in the whole world?&quot;, to which the mother would reply, &quot;Well, your father says so, and Father Knows Best!&quot; It was later replaced by Postum, a hot caffeine-free beverage that was touted as a calming beverage that would neither keep you up nor make you jittery.

On Canadian television in the early 1980s, actor Ricardo Montalbán promoted Maxwell House in commercials with the theme &quot;Morning and Maxwell House&quot;. In 1985, the company switched to more upbeat &quot;Me and Max&quot; campaigns with the common tagline &quot;Hugga Mugga Max&quot; and &quot;Good to the last drop&quot;.

===Television===

Maxwell House was the long-time sponsor of the early television series &quot;Mama&quot;, based on the play and film &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;. It starred Peggy Wood as the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family. It ran on the CBS network from 1949 to 1957. This was perhaps the first example of product placement on a TV show, as the family frequently gathered around the kitchen table for a cup of Maxwell House coffee, though these segments, aired toward the end of each episode, were usually kept separate from the main storyline. Early television programs were frequently packaged by the advertising agencies of individual sponsors. As this practice became less common in the late 1950s, Maxwell House, like most national brands, turned to &quot;spot&quot; advertising, with agencies creating sometimes long-running campaigns in support of their products.

One such 1970s campaign for Maxwell House featured the actress Margaret Hamilton, famous for playing the Wicked Witch of the West in the popular 1939 film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, as Cora, the general store owner who proudly announced that Maxwell House was the only brand she sold. Maxwell House was also a well-known sponsor of &quot;The Burns and Allen Show&quot;, during which time Maxwell House spots were incorporated into the plots of the radio scripts.

===Print advertisement===
Along with television advertising, Maxwell House used various print campaigns, always featuring the tagline &quot;good to the last drop&quot;. The publication of its Passover Haggadah by the Joseph Jacobs Advertising Agency, beginning in 1932, made Maxwell House a household name with many American Jewish families. This was part of a marketing strategy by advertiser Jacobs, who also hired an Orthodox rabbi to certify that the coffee bean was technically not &quot;kitniyot&quot; (because it was more like a berry than a bean) and was, consequently, &quot;kosher&quot; for Passover. Maxwell House was the first coffee roaster to target a Jewish demographic. The Maxwell House Haggadah was also the Haggadah of choice for the annual White House Passover Seder which President Barack Obama conducted during his presidency from 2009 to 2016.

==Manufacturing facilities==

Of its major manufacturing facilities, the third was established by Maxwell House in Jacksonville, Florida. This continues as its single operating plant for the North American market today.

The company first produced its coffee in Hoboken, New Jersey; this plant closed in the early 1990s. Its enormous rooftop sign, proclaiming the brand name and a dripping coffee cup, was a landmark visible in New York City across the Hudson River. The plant was later sold and demolished, and a condominium was subsequently built on the site. According to Ken Burns&#x27; &quot;Baseball&quot;, the Hoboken site was built on the Elysian Fields in 1939, believed to be the site of the first organized baseball game.

The company added plants in Houston, Texas; and San Leandro, California.

Kraft Foods sold the Houston plant to Maximus Coffee Group LP in late 2006. In March 2007, the neon coffee cup sign that glowed over the city&#x27;s east end was removed from the side of the 16-story coffee roaster building and the plant closed in 2018. The San Leandro plant closed in 2016 and was slated to become the site of a business park.

<doc id="615640" wikidata="Q163568" url="?curid=615640" title="Symphony No. 1 (Mozart)">
<text>The Symphony No. 1 in E major, K. 16, is a symphony written in 1764 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at the age of eight years. By this time, he was already notable in Europe as a &quot;wunderkind&quot; performer but had composed little music.

The autograph score (handwritten original) of the symphony is today preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska in Kraków.

==Background==

The symphony was written on the Mozart family&#x27;s Grand Tour of Europe in London when they had to move to Chelsea during the summer of 1764 due to Mozart&#x27;s father Leopold&#x27;s throat infection. The house at 180 Ebury Street, now in the borough of Westminster, where this symphony was written, is marked with a plaque. The symphony was first performed on 21 February 1765. The work shows the influence of several composers, including his father and the sons of Johann Sebastian Bach, especially Johann Christian Bach, an important early symphonist working in London whom Mozart had met during his time there.

==Movements and instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 2 oboes, 2 horns in E, and strings.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
\relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;string ensemble 1&quot;
 \key es \major
 \tempo &quot;Molto allegro&quot; \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 2 = 84
 es2\f g |
 \repeat unfold 8 { bes8 } |
 g4 es r2 |
 bes1\p | as | as | g | g |
&lt;/score&gt;

The work is in 3 movements:

#Molto allegro, 
#Andante, C minor, 
#Presto, 

In the second movement, the eight-year-old Mozart makes use of the four note motif that appears in the finale of his &quot;Jupiter&quot; symphony, No. 41. The four notes, C, D, F, E, make an appearance in several of Mozart&#x27;s works, including his Symphony No. 33. This theme is stated by the horns in his first symphony.

In his book on the piano concertos, Cuthbert Girdlestone pointed out the similarity between the opening of this symphony and that of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 22, K. 482, composed some twenty years later.

<text>These are the &quot;Billboard&quot; [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number one hits of 1975. Both 1974 and 1975 hold the Hot 100 record for the year with the most No. 1 hits with 35 songs reaching the No. 1 spot. Additionally, the period beginning January 11 and ending April 12 constitutes the longest run of a different No. 1 song every week (14 weeks) in &quot;Billboard&quot; history. Coincidentally, it both begins and ends with songs by Elton John. The longest running number one song of 1975 is &quot;Love Will Keep Us Together&quot; by Captain &amp; Tennille, which spent 4 weeks at the top spot.

That year, 18 acts earned their first number one song, such as Barry Manilow, Ohio Players, Linda Ronstadt, Average White Band, The Eagles, The Doobie Brothers, Labelle, Minnie Riperton, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Freddy Fender, Captain &amp; Tennille, Van McCoy, Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds, KC and the Sunshine Band, Glen Campbell, David Bowie, and Silver Convention. Frankie Valli, having already hit number one with The Four Seasons, also earns his first number one song as a solo act. Elton John, Neil Sedaka, The Eagles, John Denver, and KC and the Sunshine Band were the only acts to have more than one number one song, with Elton John having three, and the others with two.

<doc id="615642" wikidata="Q1932207" url="?curid=615642" title="West York Island">
<text>West York Island, also known as Likas Island (; Mandarin ; ), and several other names. With an area of , it is the third largest of the naturally occurring Spratly Islands, and the second largest (after Thitu Island) of the Philippine-occupied islands. It is wide, long, and its highest elevation is .

The island is administered by the Philippines as part of Kalayaan, Palawan; it is located 47 miles (76 km) northeast of Pagasa Island (Thitu Island), the location of the Philippine defined major town of Kalayaan. Filipino soldiers are stationed on the island.

The island is also claimed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and Vietnam.

==Structures and environment==
West York Island is covered with low vegetation and scrub. Outcrops are visible on the southern and eastern portion of the island during low tides. It is a sanctuary for giant sea turtles that lay their eggs on the island all year round. The high salinity of the groundwater on the island retards the growth of introduced trees like coconuts, ipil-ipil, and other types; only those plants indigenous to the area, (mostly beach types of plants), thrive and survive the hot and humid condition, especially during the dry season.

There are no buildings on the island, except for the ruins of houses built by Japanese soldiers during World War II, and a small Philippine observation post where Filipino soldiers are stationed.

The Philippine Coast Guard constructed 5 lighthouses in the area, and this includes one on West York Island.

==Plans==
Kalayaan municipal officials have proposed that this island be populated with civilian settlers &quot;within the coming years&quot;. If accomplished, it will be the second barangay of Kalayaan (after Thitu Island/Pag-asa). However, only naval vessels are currently capable of reaching the island. An estimate of 300 million pesos (US$7.5M) will be needed to construct an airstrip, a docking site, some land reclamation and other structures necessary to support an isolated community.

<text>The Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) is a project to find Kuiper belt objects (KBOs), using the facilities of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). The principal investigator is Robert L. Millis.

Since 1998 through the end of 2003, the survey covered 550 square degrees with sensitivity of 22.5, which means an estimated 50% of objects of this magnitude have been found.

The survey has also established the mean Kuiper Belt plane and introduced new formal definitions of the dynamical classes of Kuiper belt objects.

The remarkable first observations and/or discoveries include:
* 28978 Ixion, large plutino
* 19521 Chaos (cubewano)
* , the first binary trans-Neptunian object (TNO)
* , the first object with perihelion too far to be affected (scattered) by Neptune and a large semi-major axis
* , remarkable for its semi-major axis of more than 500 AU and extreme eccentricity (0.96) taking the object from the inside of the Neptune&#x27;s orbit to more than 1000 AU
* , the first Neptune trojan
*, with one of the most inclined orbits (&gt;68°)

<text>The 1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, also known variously as the Referendum on the European Community (Common Market), the Common Market referendum and EEC membership referendum, was a non-binding referendum that took place on 5 June 1975 in the United Kingdom (UK) under the provisions of the Referendum Act 1975 to ask the electorate whether the country should continue to remain a member of, or leave, the European Communities (EC) also known at the time as the Common Market — which it had joined as a member state two-and-a-half years earlier on 1 January 1973 under the Conservative government of Edward Heath. The Labour Party&#x27;s manifesto for the October 1974 general election had promised that the people would decide through the ballot box whether to remain in the EC.

In a 1975 pamphlet, Prime Minister Harold Wilson said: &quot;I ask you to use your vote. For it is &quot;your&quot; vote that will now decide. The Government will accept &quot;your&quot; verdict.&quot; The pamphlet also said: &quot;Now the time has come for &quot;you&quot; to decide. The Government will accept your decision — whichever way it goes.&quot; The electorate expressed significant support for continued EC membership, with 67% in favour on a national turnout of 64%.

This was the first national referendum ever to be held throughout the United Kingdom but due to the ancient principle of parliamentary sovereignty the result could not be binding on either the Government or Parliament, and would remain the only UK-wide referendum until the 2011 referendum on the Alternative Vote system was held thirty-six years later. It was also the only national referendum to be held on the UK&#x27;s relationship with Europe until the 2016 referendum on continued EU membership.

The February 1974 general election had yielded a Labour minority government, which went on to win a very small overall majority in the October 1974 general election. Labour pledged in its February 1974 manifesto to renegotiate the terms of British accession to the EC, and then to consult the public on whether Britain should remain in the EC on the new terms, if they were acceptable to the government. The Labour Party had historically feared the consequences of EC membership, such as the large differentials between the high price of food under the Common Agricultural Policy and the low prices prevalent in Commonwealth markets, as well as the loss of both economic sovereignty and the freedom of governments to engage in socialist industrial policies, and party leaders stated their opinion that the Conservatives had negotiated unfavourable terms for Britain. The EC heads of government agreed to a deal in Dublin on 11 March 1975; Wilson declared: &quot;I believe that our renegotiation objectives have been substantially though not completely achieved&quot;, and said that the government would recommend a vote in favour of continued membership. On 9 April, the House of Commons voted by 396 to 170 to continue within the Common Market on the new terms. Along with these developments, the government drafted a Referendum Bill, to be moved in case of a successful renegotiation.

The referendum debate and campaign was an unusual time in British politics and was the third national vote to be held in seventeen months. During the campaign, the Labour Cabinet was split and its members campaigned on each side of the question, an unprecedented breach of Cabinet collective responsibility. Most votes in the House of Commons in preparation for the referendum were only carried after opposition support, and the Government faced several defeats on technical issues such as the handling and format of the referendum counts.

The referendum did temporarily achieve Harold Wilson&#x27;s ambition to bring the divided Labour Party together on the European issue; however, eight years later, Labour&#x27;s 1983 general election manifesto pledged withdrawal from the Communities. It also significantly strengthened the position of the pro-marketeer (later pro-Europe) politicians in the UK Parliament for the next thirty years; however, the issue of continued membership, despite the outcome of the referendum, was ultimately never resolved and remained contentious.

In the decades that followed, successive UK governments integrated further into the European project by ratifying subsequent European treaties (in particular Maastricht and Lisbon). The UK Government did decide against adopting the euro after the pound was forced to withdraw from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992, in what became known as Black Wednesday. Despite this, increasingly Eurosceptic politicians believed that the principle of parliamentary sovereignty was being eroded, and called for a second referendum on Britain&#x27;s membership of what by now had become the European Union (EU), which resulted in a narrow majority in favour of the UK leaving the EU.

==Background==

When the European Coal and Steel Community was instituted in 1952, the United Kingdom decided not to become a member. The UK was still absent when the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, creating the European Economic Community (the &quot;Common Market&quot;). However, in the late 1950s the Conservative government of Harold Macmillan dramatically changed its attitude, and appointed Edward Heath to submit an application and to lead negotiations for Britain to enter the Common Market. The application was made at a meeting of the European Communities (EC) in January 1963, but the French president Charles de Gaulle rebuffed and vetoed Britain&#x27;s request. Despite the veto, Britain restarted talks with the EC countries in 1967; and in April 1970, shortly before the 1970 general election campaign, Heath — who by this time was the Conservative Party leader — said that further European integration would not happen &quot;except with the full-hearted consent of the Parliaments and peoples of the new member countries&quot;.

===1970 Conservative manifesto commitment===
The 1970 general election saw all the major political parties commit to either membership or to negotiate with the European Communities. The Conservative manifesto for the election on the issue was committed to negotiating membership but not at any price.

The Conservatives won a total of 330 seats (out of a total of 630) on 46.6% of the national vote share, gaining 77 seats, which gave them an unexpected overall majority of about 30 seats. Edward Heath became Prime Minister, and personally led many of the negotiations which began following the election; he struck up a friendship with the new French president Georges Pompidou, who oversaw the lifting of the veto and thus paved the way for UK membership.

===Negotiations and accession===

Negotiations on joining the EC first began on 30 June 1970 which was also the same day that the Common Fisheries Policy was first adopted and in the following year a UK Government white paper was published under the title of &quot;The United Kingdom and the European Communities&quot; and Edward Heath called for a parliamentary motion on the white paper. In a ministerial broadcast to the nation ahead of the debate in Parliament he said:

The debate itself took place between 21 and 28 October 1971, with the House of Commons debating directly whether or not the United Kingdom should become a member of the EC. Conservative MPs were given a free vote, Labour MPs were given a three-line whip to vote against the motion, and Liberal MPs were whipped into voting in favour of the motion. Prime Minister Edward Heath commented in the chamber just before the vote:

The House of Commons voted 356–244 in favour of the motion, a substantial majority of 112. Throughout this period, the Labour Party was divided, both on the substantive issue of EC accession and on the question of whether accession ought to be approved by referendum. In 1971 pro-Market figures such as Roy Jenkins, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, said a Labour government would have agreed to the terms of accession secured by the Conservatives. However, the National Executive Committee and the Labour Party Conference disapproved of the terms. In April 1972, the anti-EC Conservative MP Neil Marten tabled an amendment to the European Communities Bill, which called for a consultative referendum on entry. Labour had previously opposed a referendum, but the Shadow Cabinet decided to support Marten&#x27;s amendment. Jenkins resigned as Deputy Leader in opposition to the decision, and many Labour MPs abstained in the division.

No referendum was held when Britain agreed to an accession treaty on 22 January 1972, or when the twelve clause European Communities Bill went through the legislative process, on the grounds that to hold one would be unconstitutional; the bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons by just eight votes. In October 1972 the bill completed the legislative process in both the Commons and the House of Lords and was given Royal Assent completing ratification of the Accession Treaty and became the European Communities Act 1972 which was one of the most significant constitutional statutes ever to be passed by the UK Parliament in time for the accession entry date. The United Kingdom joined the European Communities as a member state on 1 January 1973, along with Denmark and Ireland. The EC would later become the European Union.

=== 1974 general elections &amp; Labour manifesto commitments ===


The initial euphoria and initial expectations of British membership after joining was very short lived as events in the Middle East would cause impacts which would be particularly felt within Britain. The Yom Kippur War would lead to an Oil embargo by Arab counties which would lead to the &quot;Three Day working week&quot; being introduced and would eventually lead to Edward Heath to call a snap election which would ultimately end his time as Prime Minister.

At the February 1974 United Kingdom general election, the Labour Party manifesto promised renegotiation of the UK&#x27;s terms of membership, to be followed by a consultative referendum on continued membership under the new terms if they were acceptable. Labour would become the largest party but were without an overall majority but managed to form a minority government.

Within one month of coming into office, the minority Labour Government started the negotiations promised in its February manifesto on the basis set out in that document.

This could be interpreted as including the option of an election in 1975.

Labour managed to win a very small working majority in a second general election which was held in October that year, and had no need of another general election and the referendum was organised.

== Legislation ==

The government produced a white paper on the proposed referendum on 26 February 1975: it recommended core public funding for both the &#x27;Yes&#x27; and &#x27;No&#x27; sides, voting rights for members of the armed forces and members of the House of Lords, and finally a proposed single central count of the votes for the whole country. This white paper was approved by the House of Commons. A Referendum Bill was introduced to the Commons on 26 March; at its second reading on 10 April, MPs voted 312–248 in favour. Prior to the Bill&#x27;s passing, there was no procedure or legislation within the United Kingdom for holding any such plebiscite. The vote, the only nationwide plebiscite to be held in the UK during the 20th century, was of constitutional significance. Referendums had been widely opposed in the past, on the grounds that they violated the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. The first major referendum (i.e. one covering more than one local government area) to be held in any part of the UK had been the sovereignty referendum in Northern Ireland in 1973.

How the votes were to be counted caused much division as the Bill went through Parliament. The government was of the opinion that, given that the poll was substantially different from a general election, and that as a national referendum the United Kingdom was a single constituency, an unprecedented single national count of all votes for the entire country would be held at Earls Court in London over several days, with one declaration of the final result by the National Counting Officer (later in the legislation the title was changed to Chief Counting Officer). This proposal did not attract the wider support of the Labour Party or the other opposition parties; the Liberal Party favoured individual counts in each of the parliamentary constituencies, and tabled an amendment to this effect, but was defeated by 263 to 131 votes in the House of Commons. However, another amendment, tabled in the Commons by Labour MP Roderick MacFarquhar, sought to have separate counts for each administrative region (the post-1974 county council areas): this won cross-party support, and was carried by 272 to 155 votes.

The Act did not specify any national supermajority of &#x27;Yes&#x27; votes for approval of the terms. It received royal assent on 8 May 1975, just under a month before the vote took place.

==Referendum question==
The question that would be put to the British electorate, as set out in the Act was:

A simple YES / NO answer was permitted (to be marked with a single &#x27;X&#x27;).

The question that was used was one of the options in the Government White Paper of February 1975, although during the passage of the Referendum Bill through Parliament, the Government agreed to add the words &quot;Common Market&quot; in brackets at the end of the question.

The referendum took place 25 years before the passing of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 by the Labour government of Tony Blair, which introduced into British law a general procedure for the holding of all future UK-wide referendums, and also created the Electoral Commission, a body that would oversee such votes and also test and research proposed referendum questions.

==Campaigning==
The referendum was called in April 1975 after the renegotiation was formally concluded. Since Prime Minister Harold Wilson&#x27;s cabinet was split between supporters and opponents of the Common Market, and since members of each side held their views strongly, he made the decision, unprecedented outside coalition government, to suspend the constitutional convention of Cabinet collective responsibility. Cabinet members would be allowed to publicly campaign against each other. In total, seven of the twenty-three members of the cabinet opposed EC membership. Wilson&#x27;s solution was that ministers speaking in the House of Commons should reflect government policy (i.e. support for EC membership), but would be allowed to speak freely elsewhere, thus avoiding a mass dismissal of Cabinet ministers. In spite of this, one minister, Eric Heffer, was obliged to resign after speaking against EC membership in the House of Commons. The main campaign period started as soon as the Referendum Act 1975 came into effect on 8 May 1975 with the vote taking place on 5 June it meant there would be just 27 campaigning days which was a very short period when compared with general elections which were held at the time (especially when compared with the ten week campaign period for the 2016 EU referendum).

===Yes campaign (Britain In Europe)===

The &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign was officially supported by Wilson and the majority of his cabinet, including the holders of the three other Great Offices of State: Denis Healey, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; James Callaghan, the Foreign Secretary; and Roy Jenkins, the Home Secretary. It was also supported by the majority of the Conservative Party, including its newly elected leader Margaret Thatcher and former Prime Minister Edward Heath (who actively campaigned for it) — 249 of 275 party members in Parliament supported staying in the EC in a free vote in April 1975 — the Liberal Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and the Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party.

===No campaign (National Referendum Campaign)===
The influential Conservative Edward du Cann said that &quot;the Labour party is hopelessly and irrevocably split and muddled over this issue&quot;. The &#x27;No&#x27; campaign included the left wing of the Labour Party, including the cabinet ministers Michael Foot, Tony Benn, Peter Shore, and Barbara Castle who during the campaign famously said &quot;They lured us into the market with the mirage of the market miracle&quot;. Some Labour &#x27;No&#x27; supporters, including Eric Varley and Douglas Jay, were on the right wing of the party, but most were from the left. The &#x27;No&#x27; campaign also included a large number of Labour backbenchers; upon the division on a pro-EC White Paper about the renegotiation, 148 Labour MPs opposed their own government&#x27;s measure, whereas only 138 supported it and 32 abstained.

&quot;Many Conservatives feel the European Community is not good for Britain ... The Conservative party is divided on it too&quot;, du Cann — head of the Conservatives&#x27; 1922 Committee — added, although there were far fewer Eurosceptic figures in the Parliamentary Conservative Party in 1975 than there would be during later debates on Europe, such as the accession to the Maastricht Treaty. Most of the Ulster Unionist Party were for &#x27;No&#x27; in the referendum, most prominently the former Conservative minister Enoch Powell, who after Benn was the second-most prominent anti-Marketeer in the campaign. Other parties supporting the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign included the Democratic Unionist Party, the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, and parties outside Parliament including the National Front and the Communist Party of Great Britain.

===Official party positions===
Conservative and Liberal Party conferences consistently supported EC membership for several years up to 1975. At a Labour Party conference on 26 April 1975, the Labour membership rejected continuing EC membership by almost a 2:1 margin. Tony Benn said, &quot;We have had a conference and the decision is clear ... It is very clear that there now must be a move for the Labour Party to campaign.&quot; The majority of the Labour Party leadership was strongly for continuing membership, and the margin of the party vote was not a surprise, since only seven of forty-six trade unions present at the conference supported EC membership. Prior to the conference, the party had decided that if the conference voted by a margin of 2:1 or more in favour of a particular option, it would then support that position in the referendum campaign. Otherwise, the &#x27;party machine&#x27; would remain neutral. Therefore, the Labour Party itself did not campaign on either side.

===The campaign, funding and media support===
The government distributed pamphlets from the official Yes and No campaigns to every household in Britain, together with its own pamphlet which argued in support of EC membership. According to this pamphlet, &quot;the most important (issues in the renegotiation) were FOOD and MONEY and JOBS&quot;.

During the campaign, almost the entire mainstream national British press supported the &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign. The left-wing &quot;Morning Star&quot; was the only notable national daily to back the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign. Television broadcasts were used by both campaigns, like party political broadcasts during general elections. They were broadcast simultaneously on all three terrestrial channels: BBC 1, BBC 2 and ITV. They attracted audiences of up to 20 million viewers. The &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign advertisements were thought to be much more effective, showing their speakers listening to and answering people&#x27;s concerns, while the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign&#x27;s broadcasts featured speakers reading from an autocue.

The &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign enjoyed much more funding, thanks to the support of many British businesses and the Confederation of British Industry. According to the treasurer of the &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign, Alistair McAlpine, &quot;The banks and big industrial companies put in very large sums of money&quot;. At the time, business was &quot;overwhelmingly pro-European&quot;, and Harold Wilson met several prominent industrialists to elicit support. It was common for pro-Europeans to convene across party and ideological lines with businessmen. John Mills, the national agent of the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign, recalled: &quot;We were operating on a shoe-string compared to the Rolls Royce operation on the other side&quot;. However, it was also the case that many civil society groups supported the &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign, including the National Farmers Union and some trade unions.

Much of the &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign focused on the credentials of its opponents. According to Alistair McAlpine, &quot;The whole thrust of our campaign was to depict the anti-Marketeers as unreliable people – dangerous people who would lead you down the wrong path ... It wasn&#x27;t so much that it was sensible to stay in, but that anybody who proposed that we came out was off their rocker or virtually Marxist.&quot; Tony Benn said there had been &quot;Half a million jobs lost in Britain and a huge increase in food prices as a direct result of our entry into the Common Market&quot;, using his position as Secretary of State for Industry as an authority. His claims were ridiculed by the &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign and ministers; the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; labelled Benn the &quot;Minister of Fear&quot;, and other newspapers were similarly derisive. Ultimately, the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign lacked a popular centrist figure to play the public leadership role for their campaign that Jenkins and Wilson fulfilled in the &#x27;Yes&#x27; campaign.

==Counting areas==
The referendum was held nationally across all four countries of the United Kingdom as a single majority vote in 68 counting areas under the provisions of the Referendum Act, for which the then administrative counties of England and Wales and the then newly formed administrative regions of Scotland were used, with Northern Ireland as a single counting area.

==Results==

Voting in the referendum took place across the United Kingdom on Thursday 5 June between 07:00 and 22:00 BST. All counting areas started their counts the following day on Friday 6 June at 09:00 BST, and the final result was announced just before 23:00 BST by the Chief Counting Officer (CCO) Sir Philip Allen at Earls Court Exhibition Centre in London, after all 68 counting areas had declared their totals. With a national turnout of 64% across the United Kingdom, the target to secure a majority for the winning side was 12,951,598 votes. The result was a decisive endorsement of continued EC membership, which won by a huge majority of 8,908,508 votes (34.5%) over those who had voted to reject continued membership.

In total, over two-thirds of voters supported continued EC membership. 67.2 per cent voted &#x27;Yes&#x27; and 32.8 per cent voted &#x27;No&#x27;. At council level, support for EC membership was positively correlated with support for the Conservative Party and with average income. In contrast, poorer areas that supported Labour gave less support to the question. Approval was well above 60% in almost every council area in England and also in Wales, with the strongly Labour-supporting Mid Glamorgan being the exception. Scotland and Northern Ireland gave less support to the question than the British average. Once the voting areas had declared, their results were then relayed to Sir Philip Allen, the Chief Counting Officer, who later declared the final result.

All the counting areas within the United Kingdom returned large majority &#x27;Yes&#x27; votes except for two Scottish regions, the Shetland Islands and the Western Isles, which returned majority votes in favour of &#x27;No&#x27;.
===Results by United Kingdom constituent countries===

==Reactions to the result==
On Friday 6 June 1975 at 18:30 BST the Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, gave his reaction outside 10 Downing Street as counting continued, although by this point the result was clear:
Enoch Powell gave this reaction to the result in a newspaper a few days after the referendum:
Roy Jenkins said: &quot;It puts the uncertainty behind us. It commits Britain to Europe; it commits us to playing an active, constructive and enthusiastic role in it.&quot; Tony Benn said: &quot;When the British people speak, everyone, including members of Parliament, should tremble before their decision and that&#x27;s certainly the spirit with which I accept the result of the referendum.&quot; Jenkins was rewarded for successfully leading the campaign for Britain to remain a member of the European Communities when two years later he became the first and only British politician during the period of British membership from 1973 until 2020 to hold the post of President of the European Commission, which he held for four years from 1977 to 1981.

The result strengthened Harold Wilson&#x27;s tactical position, by securing a further post-election public expression of support for his policies. According to Cook and Francis (1979), &#x27;The left of his party had been appeased by the holding of a referendum, the right by its result&#x27;. Following the result, the Labour Party and British trade unions themselves joined European institutions, such as the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, to which they had been reluctant to commit before public approval of EC membership.

In the House of Commons, the referendum result settled the issue of Europe for two years, until the debate about direct elections to the European Parliament began in 1977.

For the next forty-one years, the result provided a major pro-European direction to politicians, particularly in the UK Parliament and later in the newly devolved establishments in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, until the 2016 EU membership referendum was held on Thursday 23 June 2016, when the UK voted by 51.9% to 48.1% to leave the European Union. On that occasion the relative difference of enthusiasm for membership was reversed, with England and Wales voting to leave, whilst Scotland, London and Northern Ireland voted to stay. At 11pm GMT on 31 January 2020, after 47 years of membership, the United Kingdom left the European Union.

==TV coverage==
Both the BBC and ITV provided coverage throughout the following day, and the BBC programme was presented by David Dimbleby and David Butler. There were several programmes throughout the day. While ITV&#x27;s coverage was mixed in with live Horse Racing coverage from Epsom of the Epsom Oaks day card and was presented by Robert Kee and Peter Jay. This was the only major UK poll in which Alastair Burnet was not involved in the TV coverage as lead presenter as he was editing the Daily Express at the time of the referendum and was taking a break from broadcasting.

The BBC only kept two hours of coverage - that shown between 2pm and 4pm although even by then the outcome was very clear - and that coverage was repeated on BBC Parliament to mark the 30th anniversary of the referendum in June 2005. It was also reshown to mark the 40th anniversary in June 2015 on the BBC Parliament channel, and was also shown again to mark the 41st anniversary, ahead of the 2016 EU Referendum. 41 years after the 1975 referendum, David Dimbleby also hosted the BBC&#x27;s coverage as the UK voted to leave the EU.

<text>Sigma Chi () International Fraternity is one of the largest of North American social fraternities. The fraternity has 244 active undergraduate chapters and 152 alumni chapters across the United States and Canada and has initiated over 350,000 members. The fraternity was founded on June 28, 1855, at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, by members who split from the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

Sigma Chi is divided into seven operational entities: the Sigma Chi Fraternity, the Sigma Chi Foundation, the Sigma Chi Canadian Foundation, the Risk Management Foundation, Constantine Capital Inc., the Blue and Gold Travel Services, and the newly organised Sigma Chi Leadership Institute.

Like all fraternities, Sigma Chi has its own colors, insignia, and rituals. According to the fraternity&#x27;s constitution, &quot;the purpose of this fraternity shall be to cultivate and maintain the high ideals of friendship, justice, and learning upon which Sigma Chi was founded.&quot;

==History==
===Founding===

Sigma Chi was founded in 1855 by Benjamin Piatt Runkle, Thomas Cowan Bell, William Lewis Lockwood, Isaac M. Jordan, Daniel William Cooper, Franklin Howard Scobey, and James Parks Caldwell as the result of a disagreement over who would be elected Poet in the Erodelphian Literary Society of Miami University in Ohio.

Several members of Miami University&#x27;s Delta Kappa Epsilon chapter (of which all but one of Sigma Chi&#x27;s founders were members) were also members of the Erodelphian Literary Society. In the fall of 1854 the literary society was to elect its poet and a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon was nominated for the position. He was supported by five of his brothers, but four others, James Caldwell, Isaac Jordan, Benjamin Runkle, and Franklin Scobey, supported another man who was not a member of the fraternity. Although Thomas Bell and Daniel Cooper were not members of Erodelphian they had aligned themselves with the four dissenting members. The chapter had twelve members total and were evenly divided on the issue. Both sides saw this as a matter of principle and over the next few months their friendships became distanced.

In February 1855 Runkle and his companions planned a dinner for their brothers in an attempt to seal the rift. Whitelaw Reid, one of the other brothers who supported the Delta Kappa Epsilon member as poet, was the only one to arrive. Reid brought a Delta Kappa Epsilon alumnus named Minor Millikin from a nearby town. Reid had told Millikin his side of the dispute and they had arrived to punish the group for not supporting their Delta Kappa Epsilon brother. The leaders of the rebellion, Runkle and Scobey, were to be expelled from the fraternity. The other four would be allowed to stay in the fraternity. Runkle resigned, and after the parent chapter at Yale University was contacted, all six men were formally expelled.

The six men decided to form their own fraternity along with William Lewis Lockwood, a student from New York who had not joined a fraternity. On June 28, 1855, the organization was founded under the name &quot;Sigma Phi Fraternity&quot;. Lockwood used his business training to help organize the fraternity in its early years. The eventual theft of Sigma Phi&#x27;s constitution, rituals, seals, and other records from Lockwood&#x27;s room in Oxford in January 1856 prompted them to change the name of the fraternity to Sigma Chi. It is possible this action could have been forced upon the group as there was already a Sigma Phi Society.

Much of Sigma Chi&#x27;s heraldry was inspired by the legendary story of the Emperor Constantine from the Battle of Milvian Bridge against Maxentius. The White Cross and the motto &quot;In Hoc Signo Vinces&quot; are examples of the Constantine link.

===Founders===

*Benjamin Piatt Runkle (September 3, 1836 – June 28, 1916) was born in West Liberty, Ohio. Runkle helped design the badge of Sigma Chi based on the story of Constantine and the vision of the Cross. Runkle was known for having a fierce pride and was suspended from Miami University when he fought a member of Beta Theta Pi for sneering at his badge. When the Civil War began Runkle joined the Union Army. He was badly wounded at the Battle of Shiloh and left for dead on the battlefield. Runkle stayed in the army as a career and retired as a major general. After is service in the Union Army he was ordained an Episcopal priest. He was the only founder to serve as Grand Consul. He died on Sigma Chi&#x27;s 61st birthday in Ohio. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.
*Thomas Cowan Bell (May 14, 1832 – February 3, 1919) was born near Dayton, Ohio. He was twenty-three years old when Sigma Chi was founded, second oldest of the founders. He graduated from Miami University in 1857 and began teaching. In 1861 he enlisted in the Union Army and rose to the rank of lieutenant. After the war he returned to his career in education, serving as the superintendent of schools in Nobles County, Minnesota as well as the principal and president of several preparatory and collegiate institutions in the Western United States. Bell died the day after attending the initiation of &quot;Alpha Beta chapter&quot; at University of California Berkeley on February 3, 1919. He is buried at the Presidio of San Francisco in San Francisco National Cemetery in California. Section OS, Row 43A, Grave 3.
*William Lewis Lockwood (October 31, 1836 – August 17, 1867) was born in New York City. He was the only founder who had not been a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. He was considered the &quot;businessman&quot; of the founders and managed the first chapter&#x27;s funds and general operations, becoming the first treasurer of Sigma Chi. After graduating from Miami University in 1858 he moved back to New York and began work as a lawyer. He received serious wounds serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, from which he never fully recovered. He named his son after Franklin Howard Scobey.
*Isaac M. Jordan (May 5, 1835 – December 3, 1890) was born in Mifflinburg, Pennsylvania as Isaac Alfred Jordan. His family later moved to Ohio where Jordan met Benjamin Piatt Runkle and became close friends. After graduating from Miami University in 1857 he went on to graduate school, where he graduated in 1862. He then began work as an attorney and was elected to the United States Congress in 1882. He proceeded to change his middle name, Alfred, to just the letter &quot;M&quot; to help distinguish himself from his brother and law partner, Jackson A. Jordan. He died in 1890 after accidentally falling down an elevator shaft while greeting a friend. He is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio.
*Daniel William Cooper (September 2, 1830 – December 11, 1920) was born near Fredericktown, Ohio. Cooper was the oldest founder and was elected the first consul of Sigma Chi. After graduating from Miami University in 1857 he became a Presbyterian minister. Cooper&#x27;s original Sigma Chi badge came into the possession of the Fraternity at the time of his death. It is pinned on every new Grand Consul at their installation. Cooper is buried at the Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh, Pa.
*Franklin Howard Scobey (May 27, 1837 – July 22, 1888) was born in Hamilton, Ohio. Scobey was considered The Spirit of Sigma Chi for being friendly with everybody and not just a select group of people. After graduating from Miami University in 1858 he went on to graduate again in 1861 with a law degree. He worked as a journalist in his hometown until 1879 but went on to become a cattleman in Kansas until 1882. Scobey then moved back to Ohio where he took up farming until his death. Never physically robust, Scobey was afflicted with hearing loss in his final years.
*James Parks Caldwell (March 27, 1841 – April 5, 1912) was born in Monroe, Ohio. By the age of thirteen Caldwell had completed all academics which could be offered at his local academy. He was then sent to Miami University with advanced credits. Caldwell was just fourteen at the time of the founding making him the youngest of the founders. After Caldwell graduated from Miami University in 1857 he practiced some law in Ohio but moved to Mississippi to begin a career as an educator. When the Civil War broke out he joined the Confederate Army. During the war he was taken prisoner but later, due to the influence of General Benjamin Piatt Runkle, was offered freedom on the condition that he renounce his allegiance to the Confederacy. He rejected this offer and remained loyal to the south. He was later released, again due to the influence of General Runkle. After the war he moved back to Mississippi and was admitted to the bar. He moved to California in 1867 and practiced law. In 1875, he began to travel frequently practicing law and editing newspapers. He died in Biloxi, Mississippi where the latest issues of The Sigma Chi Quarterly were found in his room.

===Early years===
====Constantine chapter====

Harry St. John Dixon, a brother from the &quot;Psi chapter&quot; at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, who fought for the Confederacy, kept a record of all Sigma Chis within his vicinity on the flyleaf of his diary during the Civil War. He began planning a Confederate Army chapter of Sigma Chi with this information. On September 17, 1864 Dixon founded the &quot;Constantine chapter&quot; of Sigma Chi during the Atlanta campaign with Harry Yerger, a brother from Mississippi who was in Dixon&#x27;s division. Dixon stated the reasons for which the war-time chapter was created saying, 

Dixon and Yerger contacted all brothers listed in the diary who could come to the meeting. They met at night in a deserted log cabin a few miles southwest of Atlanta. Dixon later wrote, 
Dixon was elected &quot;Sigma&quot; (president) and Yerger was elected &quot;Chi&quot; (vice president); the chapter also initiated two men. The only badge in the chapter was one Dixon had made from a silver half-dollar.

The last meeting was held New Year&#x27;s Day 1865. The men at that meeting passed a resolution to pay a &quot;tribute of respect&quot; to the four brothers from the chapter who had died during the war. In May 1939 the &quot;Constantine chapter&quot; Memorial was erected by Sigma Chi in memory of the &quot;Constantine chapter&quot; and its members. The memorial is located on U.S. 41 in Clayton County, Georgia.

====Purdue case====
In 1876, Emerson E. White became president of Purdue University. He required each applicant for admission to sign a pledge &quot;not to join or belong to any so-called Greek society or other college secret society&quot; while attending the school. The Sigma Chi chapter at Purdue, which was already established at the university, sent petitions to the faculty and pleaded their case to the board of trustees, but was unsuccessful in changing the rule.

In the fall of 1881, Thomas P. Hawley applied for admission to the university. Having already been initiated into Sigma Chi, Hawley refused to sign the pledge and was denied admission. Hawley took Purdue to court, but the judge ruled in favor of the faculty&#x27;s decision. He also ruled, however, that the faculty had no right to deny Hawley from his classes based on the fraternity issue. The case was brought to the Indiana Supreme Court, which reversed the decision on June 21, 1882. This victory for Sigma Chi also allowed other fraternities at Purdue and led to the Purdue president&#x27;s resignation in 1883.

=== 20th century ===

During the first half of the 20th century the General Fraternity expanded in many places. In 1899, the fraternity adopted the flag design created by Henry V. Vinton. In 1901 the Grand Chapter approved the Fraternity&#x27;s pledge pin. In 1903 at the Grand Chapter in Detroit the Board of Grand Trustees was established. In 1922 the &quot;Alpha Beta chapter&quot; at University of California, Berkeley held the &quot;Channingway Derby&quot; which led to the creation of the &quot;Sigma Chi Derby Days&quot;. Some of the awards created during this time include the Significant Sig Award in 1935 and the Order of Constantine in 1948.

As of the beginning of the 20th century, Sigma Chi had installed a total of 74 chapters with 58 still active. Having only established a centralized form of government in 1922, Sigma Chi was installing new chapters at a rate of about one chapter per year. On April 22, 1922, the &quot;Beta Omega chapter&quot; was installed at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario thus making Sigma Chi an international fraternity.

The Sigma Chi Foundation was created on November 9, 1939, when the Sigma Chi Endowment Foundation was incorporated in Colorado. This educational endowment was first discussed in 1898 by alumni who wanted to assist undergraduates financially so they could finish their undergraduate studies.

The world wars of the 20th century took the lives of 103 Sigs in World War I and 738 in World War II. A great resurgence in undergraduate activity followed World War II due to an increase in chapter memberships. This increase was caused by the men returning from military service who went back to school and the usual addition of new brothers. During World War II, it became apparent to the General Fraternity officers that a few alumni as well as a few undergraduate chapters believed some of the prerequisites for membership in Sigma Chi were outdated and should be changed or eliminated. This led to the first discussions about membership within the fraternity that continued until early in 1970. Until this time, membership requirements had specified that a potential member must be a &quot;bona fide white male student&quot;. After the first discussion in 1948 at the Grand Chapter in Seattle, the committee on Constitutional Amendments tabled the issue pending a further study of the problem to be reported to the 1950 Grand Chapter. The study showed that the issue was &quot;very hot&quot; on 13 campuses with Sigma Chi chapters and only &quot;lukewarm&quot; on a dozen other campuses.

During this time period, the remaining four founders of Sigma Chi of the original seven all died; Daniel William Cooper was the last founder to die. Cooper&#x27;s death led up to the Fraternity gaining one of its most priceless objects, Cooper&#x27;s Sigma Phi badge. Cooper&#x27;s body was sent by train to his final resting place in Pittsburgh, and the &quot;Beta Theta chapter&quot; at the University of Pittsburgh was given the privilege to administer his memorial service. 

On December 13, 1920, Cooper&#x27;s body was conveyed to the &quot;Beta Theta chapter&quot; house, where Beta Theta Consul Donald E. Walker removed Cooper&#x27;s Sigma Phi Badge and replaced it with his own. Beta Theta Pro-Consul, Regis Toomey, sang the hymn &quot;With Sacred Circle Broken&quot; before Cooper was taken to his final resting place.

==Nomenclature and insignia==
===Badge===
The badge of Sigma Chi is a white cross with white and black enamel. Two gold chains connect the two upper arms. Crossed keys are in the upper arm, an eagle&#x27;s head lies in the left arm, and a scroll lies in its right arm. In the bottom arm lie two clasped hands and seven stars.

===Seal===

The seal of Sigma Chi is circular. On the outer edge is &quot;Sigma Chi Fraternity&quot; and at the bottom are the numbers &quot;1855&quot;. In the middle lie seven stars and a seven-branched candlestick.

===Coat of Arms===
The crest of Sigma Chi is a blue Norman Shield with a white cross in its center. On top of the Norman Shield is a scroll and a crest of an eagle&#x27;s head holding a key. Below it, the fraternity&#x27;s public motto, &quot;In Hoc Signo Vinces&quot; is placed on a scroll. It can be translated as, &quot;In this sign, thou shalt conquer.&quot;

==Governance==
===Chapter officers===
Officers in undergraduate chapters mostly have titles derived from Imperial Rome. The top officers of each chapter are known as the Consul (president), Pro Consul (vice-president), Annotator (secretary), Quaestor (treasurer), Magister (pledge trainer), Kustos (sergeant-at-arms), Tribune (communications), Risk Manager, and Historian. Those titles are the primary officers common to all chapters. Chapters also have other positions, such as Social Chairman, Sports Chairman, Scholarship Chairman, House Manager, Recruitment Chairman, etc., plus other positions and titles varying from chapter to chapter.

Alumni chapter positions and duties may also vary from chapter to chapter. Alumni chapters use the more common office titles such as: president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer.

===Grand officers===
The international organization uses similar Roman titles, typically with the prefix of &quot;Grand&quot;. The Grand Consul is the international president of Sigma Chi. He presides over the Executive Committee and the Grand Chapter.

===Grand Chapter===
Grand Chapter is the supreme legislative body of Sigma Chi and convenes on odd numbered years. It is composed of one delegate from each active undergraduate chapter and alumni chapter, the Grand Consul and Past Grand Consuls, each being entitled to one vote. The Grand Chapter elects the officers of the Fraternity as well as alter or amend the Constitution, Statutes, and Executive Committee Regulations. It may grant or revoke charters as well as discipline any chapter, officer or member. The most recent Sigma Chi Grand Chapter was held in Toronto, Ontario on June 22–25, 2023.

===Grand Council===
The Grand Council meets every year when no Grand Chapter is held. The Grand Council consists of the Grand Officers, Past Grand Consuls, members of the Executive Committee, Grand Trustees, Grand Praetors, members of the Leadership Training Board and one undergraduate from each province. It may amend the Statutes or Executive Committee Regulations.

===Executive Committee===
The Executive Committee meets at least four times a year. The Executive Committee consists of 12 members; Grand Consul, Grand Pro Consul, Grand Quaestor, the immediate Past Grand Consul, a Grand Trustee elected by the Board of Grand Trustees, two Grand Praetors elected by the Praetorial College, one alumnus member-at-large, two undergraduate representatives elected by the undergraduate delegates from each chapter, and the two most recent International Balfour Award winners. The committee regulates the budget and expenditures as well as assign duties to the International Headquarters staff.

===Charitable foundations===
The Sigma Chi Foundation is a charitable and educational tax-exempt organization, separate and independent from the Fraternity, whose express purpose is to serve as an educational funding resource for the undergraduate and graduate student members of the Sigma Chi Fraternity.

A Board of Governor governs the Foundation. The Foundation&#x27;s President and CEO is Ashley Woods and the Foundation&#x27;s offices are based in Evanston, Illinois.

The Sigma Chi Canadian Foundation is the Canadian counterpart of The Sigma Chi Foundation. It serves independently of both the fraternity and the American foundation. It was formed by Canadian Sigma Chi Alumni as a registered charitable foundation to provide a tax-effective way for Canadian Sigma Chi to support the educational pursuits of Canadian undergraduate chapters. The Foundation is guided by a Chair and a Board of Directors of alumni members.

==Leadership programs==
*The Krach Transformational Leaders Workshop (KTLW) is a three-day retreat held annually since 1947. Undergraduate members receive training for specific roles within their chapter. Alumni volunteers are also given mentorship training. The KTLW is named after the 64th Grand Consul of the Fraternity, Keith Krach.
*Horizons is a six-day workshop for undergraduate brothers. The program aims to create lifelong values-based leaders.
*Mission 365 is a recruitment workshop. Participants are taught how to &quot;increase both the quality and quantity&quot; of potential new members.
*The Journey Program is self-improvement training for undergraduate chapters. There are six Journey workshops, each with a specific aim to better one aspect of the chapter.
*The Sigma Chi Choices program and The Sigma Chi Crossroads Workshop both aim to combat drug and alcohol abuse and address mental health among members.
*Sigma Chi Lifeline is an online resource for those suffering from mental illness. The program aims to prevent suicide among college students by providing information and support for those affected by emotional and mental health issues.

==Philanthropy==
===Derby Days===
Derby Days is a series of charity events held by all Sigma Chi chapters. Throughout the course of a week, a participating chapter organizes and hosts a series of events and competitions among their campus&#x27; sororities. Money is raised through either donations, or through fundraising-type events. Hosting a Derby Days event is not mandatory for any chapter. A common event held across many campuses is the Derby Run, where brothers must wear derbies throughout the day, while sisters in participating sororities attempt to steal them. According to the International Fraternity&#x27;s official website, the basic mission of Derby Days is to serve the community. According to archival information at Sigma Chi International Headquarters, the first &quot;Derby Day&quot; event was held in 1916 at the University of California-Berkeley. Then known as the &quot;Channing Way Derby&quot; because of the California-Berkeley chapter&#x27;s location on Channing Way and College Avenue, the event spread to other chapters who created their own Derby Day. The most money raised by any Sigma Chi chapter was the &quot;Iota Psi chapter&quot; at Rutgers University in the fall of 2016. The brothers of the &quot;Iota Psi chapter&quot; raised $300,007 with the help of the eight sororities at the University: Zeta Tau Alpha, Phi Sigma Sigma, Sigma Delta Tau, Phi Mu, Delta Gamma, Gamma Phi Beta, Sigma Kappa, and Alpha Gamma Delta. This money is all donated to the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. $300,007 is the most money raised in a single event by any single Greek Organization in the world.

===Merlin Olsen Day of Service===
In honor of notable Sigma Chi alumni and NFL Hall of Fame inductee Merlin Olsen, September 15 is recognized by the fraternity as the Merlin Olsen Day of Service. On this day, members of the fraternity are encouraged to volunteer to improve their communities.

Children&#x27;s Miracle Network Hospitals (CMNH) is Sigma Chi&#x27;s suggested beneficiary. The organization was introduced to the fraternity by Olsen in 1992. Since then Sigma Chi alumni and undergraduate chapters have raised more than 6.9 million for CMNH. Every chapter has a CMNH affiliate within less than 200 miles, with each chapter donating to the nearest affiliated hospital.

===Huntsman Cancer Foundation/Huntsman Cancer Institute===
The Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCF/HCI) is Sigma Chi&#x27;s preferred charitable partner. It was chosen at Sigma Chi&#x27;s 150th anniversary celebration in 2005. The Huntsman Cancer Institute today is dedicated to researching the causes, treatments, and preventative methods of cancer. The institute was founded in 1995 by Sigma Chi alumnus, and founder of the Huntsman Corporation, Jon M. Huntsman Sr. Huntsman has donated more than 350 million dollars to the institute, and has encouraged his fellow brothers to contribute as well. By 2023, Sigma Chi undergraduate chapters had raised over $21 million to support the Huntsman Cancer Institute and have raised their pledge to an additional $20 million, for a $31 total pledge. In calendar year 2023, Sigma Chi undergraduate chapters raised $2,711,368.

==Awards==
===Undergraduate awards===
Sigma Chi gives out two undergraduate awards, The Peterson Significant Chapter Award, which is given to chapters who show a strong performance in all areas of chapter operations, and The International Balfour Award, which is given each year to one graduating senior who excels in four criteria; scholarship, character, Fraternity service and campus leadership.

===Alumni awards===
The fraternity also gives out three alumni awards: The Significant Sig Award is given to a member who has excelled greatly in his field of study or occupation. The first seven Significant Sig awards were given to George Ade, Roy Chapman Andrews, John T. McCutcheon, Chase S. Osborn, James Wallington, F. Dudleigh Vernor, and Samuel P. Cowley. The Order of Constantine is awarded to alumni members who have devoted long and distinguished service to the Fraternity. The Semi-Century Sig Award is given to brothers who have been active in the fraternity for 50 years or more.

===International Sweetheart===

Most undergraduate chapters elect a female associated with the chapter as the chapter sweetheart. At each Grand Chapter, the fraternity chooses a Sweetheart from one chapter to be the International Sweetheart of Sigma Chi for two years. The International Sweetheart Award is presented based on personality, character, campus involvement, Sigma Chi activities, general accomplishments, poise, and grace. Each nominee must be the sweetheart of an undergraduate chapter for the year nominated and a student at the nominating chapter&#x27;s university. Judy Garland was a Sigma Chi Sweetheart from the Ohio State University chapter and Faye Dunaway was a Sigma Chi Sweetheart from The University of Florida chapter.

===Military Service Recognition Pin===
The Military Service Recognition Pin recognizes honorably discharged veterans or currently serving members of the armed forces who are in good standing with the Sigma Chi Fraternity. The pin consists of a single Norman-style sword thrust upward with a small Sigma Chi Norman Shield with a cross embossed upon it placed upon the lower end of the blade just above the hilt and is to be worn on the brother&#x27;s lapel. The Military service pin concept and design was created by Life Loyal Sig Anthony Dauer Theta Beta 1993 and was first presented at the 2007 Grand Chapter.

==Publications==
===&quot;The Magazine of Sigma Chi&quot;===
&quot;The Magazine of Sigma Chi&quot; is the official quarterly publication for undergraduate and alumni brothers of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. First published in 1881 at Gettysburg College, &quot;Theta chapter&quot;, as &quot;The Sigma Chi&quot;, publication eventually moved to Chicago and the name was changed to &quot;The Sigma Chi Quarterly&quot;. The name was later changed to &quot;The Magazine of Sigma Chi&quot;

===&quot;The Norman Shield&quot;===
&quot;The Norman Shield&quot; is the reference manual of the Fraternity. It was authorized by the 24th Grand Consul Herbert C. Arms at the 1924 Grand Chapter. It was first compiled in 1929 by Arthur Vos, Jr. and based on the booklet he prepared for the &quot;Beta Mu chapter&quot; at the University of Colorado at Boulder which Vos indicated was based on the material contained in the 1922 Manual and Directory. It contained biographies of the founders, significant alumni, a history of the Fraternity, the Constitution and Statutes, and other writings relevant to the fraternity.

==Chapters==

As of 2023, the fraternity has sixteen associate chapters or colonies.

==Notable members==

Sigma Chi has alumni who are notable in many different industries and fields.

==Controversies and member misconduct==
=== 20th century ===
*In 1965 and 1967 respectively, the Sigma Chi chapters at Stanford University in Stanford, California and Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, disaffiliated from the national fraternity organization when they refused to abide by the whites-only membership policy of the national organization. The policy of the national organization was changed in 1971 to eliminate the racial discrimination.

=== 2000s ===
*In 2004, a 19-year-old University of Oklahoma freshman was found dead in the Sigma Chi fraternity house. The university suspended its recognition of the Beta Kappa chapter. In 2006 the Beta Kappa chapter of Sigma Chi was reinstated at the University of Oklahoma.
* The chapter at San Jose State University in San Jose, California found a member, Gregory Johnson, Jr., hanged in its basement on November 22, 2008. Ruled a suicide at the time, a group of activists in 2020 later publicized their concerns over what they believe to be an incomplete investigation of Johnson&#x27;s death, citing the possibility of racist motivations.
*The chapter at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln was suspended for hazing and alcohol consumption violations in 2009. The hazing pledges endured included taking shots of Tabasco hot sauce and vodka until they vomited, they were ordered to do strenuous exercises while their &quot;big brothers&quot; threw objects at them, and one pledge was randomly chosen and was anally penetrated with a vibrating dildo by a hired female stripper during an initiation party. Eight members were arrested and charged with hazing and providing alcohol to minors.

=== 2010s ===
*In September 2012, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga campus police fielded a report of a rape at the Sigma chi fraternity house.
*In 2012, the chapter at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama was sued by a former pledge after he was severely beaten by fraternity members at a party that resulted in serious injuries, depression, and severe anxiety. The chapter was also cited for providing alcohol to underage people.
*The chapter at the University of Dayton in Dayton was suspended for three years in 2013 for damaging a store&#x27;s property, urinating inside the store and exposing themselves to passersby.
*A fraternity member at Westminster College in St. Louis served 120 days in jail for violently beating up one of his fraternity brothers in 2013.
*The chapter at the University of Central Florida in Orlando was placed on suspension in 2013 after photos surfaced on social media of pledges being forced to consume alcohol and getting sick from over-consumption. Several other fraternities on campus were also accused of hazing and alcohol abuse with their pledges that same semester which led to the president of the university temporarily banning all Greek Life activities on campus.
* Three Sigma Chi members at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia were found guilty of sexually assaulting a female student and distributing a recording of the incident. The members were banned from the campus after their graduation in 2014.
* The chapter at the West Virginia University in Morgantown had six members arrested in 2014 and cited by the Morgantown police department for hazing pledges and facilitating underage drinking. After a party hosted by the fraternity, several members dropped off nineteen pledges, most of whom were intoxicated, at a random location far away from campus without their cellphones and wallets and told them to find their way back to their fraternity house on campus as part of a &quot;team building&quot; exercise.
* The University of Dayton in Dayton permanently banned the fraternity in 2014 after a member’s death revealed the chapter had not been abiding by the parameters of its suspension.
*A Sigma Chi member at Utah State University in Logan was kicked out the fraternity in 2015 after being charged with two counts of rape and aggravated sexual assault. The attacks are believed to have taken place at the fraternity house.
*The chapter at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island was suspended in 2015 for facilitating sexual misconduct and hosting an unauthorized party with alcohol.
* The chapter at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge was shut down in 2015 for repeatedly hazing pledges and illegal drug use in the fraternity house. Two months before the chapter closure a 21-year-old fraternity member died of a heroin overdose.
* The chapter at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga was suspended after the rape of a minor in 2016. The investigation uncovered 148 reports of sexual offenses over a 7 year period
* A former pledge at the University of Arizona in Tucson sued his chapter in 2016 after his fraternity brothers blamed him for the nonfatal overdose of a female party attendee.
* The chapter at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton expelled a member in 2017 after he was found out to have embezzled over $18,000 from the chapter funds. The reason the former brother embezzled the funds was to fund his heroin addiction.
*The chapter at Fresno State University was suspended in 2019 due to underage drinking, property damage, noise complaints, and multiple physical assaults that resulted in serious injuries at their fraternity-sponsored party they promoted as &quot;Cinco de Drinko&quot;, May 5. After learning of the incident, the university and Sigma Chi national headquarters placed the chapter on interim suspension.

===2020s===
*A former pledge at the University of Texas at Arlington (UT Arlington) sued the fraternity for $1 million in 2020. While pledging the fraternity, he was ordered by fraternity members to excessively consume alcohol which led to alcohol poisoning. Also he was subject to other hazing activities that often led to humiliation and black outs. National leadership of the fraternity decided to suspend the UT Arlington chapter indefinitely.
*In 2021, as part of an allegedly mandatory hazing event at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga chapter, 18-year-old freshman Dylan Johnson died as a result of excessive alcohol consumption. Manslaughter charges were brought against the Sigma Chi organization itself, rather than any individuals. In response, the chapter dissolved and the case was suspended. MIT later settled with Johnson&#x27;s family for 3.46 million dollars.
*A sexual assault was report to University of Nebraska campus police and on social media in August 2021 as having taken place at Sigma Chi in Lincoln. Sigma Chi announced the chapter was being placed on &quot;self-suspension&quot; and the accused fraternity member ejected. The report came in during ongoing street protests against nearby Phi Gamma Delta, where a sexual assault was reported a week prior.
* In January 2022, National Public Radio obtained a partial copy of a police report of a call by then-student Elizabeth Holmes on October 5, 2003, in which she said she had been sexually assaulted in the early hours of that morning at the Sigma Chi fraternity house at Stanford University. Holmes would found the biotechnology start-up company Theranos later that same year, and the alleged sexual assault came to light when she was on trial for fraud in her work at the company in 2021.

<text> (&quot;The Clemency of Titus&quot;), K. 621, is an &quot;opera seria&quot; in two acts composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to an Italian libretto by Caterino Mazzolà, after Pietro Metastasio. Mozart completed the work in the midst of composing &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot;, his last opera. &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; premiered on 6 September 1791 at the Estates Theatre in Prague.

== Background ==

In 1791, the last year of his life, Mozart was already well advanced in writing &quot;&quot; by July when he was asked to compose an &quot;opera seria&quot;. The commission came from the impresario Domenico Guardasoni, who lived in Prague and who had been charged by the Estates of Bohemia with providing a new work to celebrate the coronation of Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, as King of Bohemia. The coronation had been planned by the Estates in order to ratify a political agreement between Leopold and the nobility of Bohemia (it had rescinded efforts of Leopold&#x27;s brother Joseph II to initiate a program to free the serfs of Bohemia and increase the tax burden of aristocratic landholders). Leopold desired to pacify the Bohemian nobility in order to forestall revolt and strengthen his empire in the face of political challenges engendered by the French Revolution. The ceremony was to take place on 6 September; Guardasoni had been approached about the opera in June. No opera of Mozart was more clearly pressed into the service of a political agenda than &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, in this case to promote the reactionary political and social policies of an aristocratic elite. No evidence exists to evaluate Mozart&#x27;s attitude toward this, or even whether he was aware of the internal political conflicts raging in the kingdom of Bohemia in 1791.

In a contract dated 8 July, Guardasoni promised that he would engage a castrato &quot;of leading quality&quot; (this seems to have mattered more than who wrote the opera); that he would &quot;have the libretto caused to be written...and to be set to music by a distinguished maestro&quot;. The time was tight and Guardasoni had a get-out clause: if he failed to secure a new text, he would resort to &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, a libretto written more than half a century earlier by Pietro Metastasio (1698–1782).

Metastasio&#x27;s libretto had already been set by nearly 40 composers; the story is based on the life of Roman Emperor Titus, from some brief hints in &quot;The Lives of the Caesars&quot; by the Roman writer Suetonius, and was elaborated by Metastasio in 1734 for the Italian composer Antonio Caldara. Among later settings were Gluck&#x27;s in 1752 and Josef Mysliveček&#x27;s version in 1774. Mozart was definitely familiar with the libretto before composition; in 1770, he saw a production with his father of &#x27;s setting in Cremona. There would be three further settings after 1791. Mozart was not Guardasoni&#x27;s first choice. Instead, he approached Antonio Salieri, the most distinguished composer of Italian opera in Vienna and head of the music establishment at the imperial court. But Salieri was too busy, and he declined the commission, although he did attend the coronation.

The libretto was edited into a more useful state by the court poet Caterino Mazzolà. Unusually, in Mozart&#x27;s personal catalogue of compositions, Mazzolà is credited for his revision with the note that the libretto had been &quot;reworked into a true opera&quot;. Mazzolà conflated the original three act libretto into two acts, and none of the original Metastasio arias are from the original middle act. Mazzolà replaced a lot of the dialogue with ensembles and wrote a new act one finale, cobbled from lines in the original libretto, which presents the uprising, whereas Metastasio merely describes it.

Guardasoni&#x27;s experience of Mozart&#x27;s work on &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; convinced him that the younger composer was more than capable of working on the tightest deadline. Mozart readily accepted the commission given his fee would be twice the price of a similar opera commissioned in Vienna. Mozart&#x27;s earliest biographer Niemetschek alleged that the opera was completed in just 18 days, and in such haste that the &quot;secco&quot; recitatives were supplied by another composer, probably Franz Xaver Süssmayr, believed to have been Mozart&#x27;s pupil. Although no other documentation exists to confirm Süssmayr&#x27;s participation, none of the secco recitatives are in Mozart&#x27;s autograph, and it is known that Süssmayr traveled with Mozart to Prague a week before the premiere to help with rehearsals, proofreading, and copying. It has been suggested by scholars of Mozart that he had been working on the opera much longer, perhaps since 1789; however, all such theories have now been thoroughly refuted in the English-language musicological literature. The opera may not have been written in just 18 days, but it certainly ranks with Rossini&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot;, &quot;Il barbiere di Siviglia&quot; and &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; as one of the operas written in the shortest amount of time that is still frequently performed today.

It is not known what Leopold thought of the opera written in his honor. Reports that his wife Maria Luisa of Spain dismissed it as &quot;&quot; (literally in Italian &quot;German swinishness&quot;, but most idiomatically translated &quot;A German mess&quot;) do not pre-date 1871, in a collection of literary vignettes by Alfred Meissner about the history of Prague purportedly based on recollections of the author&#x27;s grandfather, who was present for the coronation ceremonies.

== Performance history ==

It has been commonly asserted that Mozart himself was the conductor, although H. C. Robbins Landon says that is &quot;most unlikely&quot;. The role of Sesto was taken by the castrato soprano Domenico Bedini. The opera was first performed publicly on 6 September 1791 at the Estates Theatre in Prague. While the orchestra was that of the theatre, the clarinet player Anton Stadler had journeyed to Prague with Mozart and played in the orchestra. It was for him that Mozart wrote two very prominent obbligati: for basset clarinet in Sesto&#x27;s aria &quot;Parto, parto, ma tu ben mio&quot;, and for basset horn in Vitellia&#x27;s aria &quot;Non più di fiori&quot;.

Excerpts from the opera were performed on 28 February 1796 at the Berlin Royal Opera, with Margarete Luise Schick, Henriette Righini, , , , and Constanze Mozart performing.

The opera remained popular for many years after Mozart&#x27;s death. It was the first full Mozart opera to reach London, receiving its première there at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on 27 March 1806. The cast included John Braham, whose long-time companion Nancy Storace had been the first Susanna in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; in Vienna. However, as it was only played once, it does not appear to have attracted much interest. As far as can be gathered, it was not staged in London again until at the St Pancras Festival in 1957. The first performance at La Scala in Milan was on 26 December 1818. The North American premiere was staged on 4 August 1952 at the Berkshire Music Center in Tanglewood. For a long time, Mozart scholars regarded &quot;Tito&quot; as an inferior effort of the composer. Alfred Einstein in 1945 wrote that it was &quot;customary to speak disparagingly of &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; and to dismiss it as the product of haste and fatigue&quot;, and he continues the disparagement to some extent by condemning the characters as puppets – e.g., &quot;Tito is nothing but a mere puppet representing magnanimity&quot; – and claiming that the &quot;opera seria&quot; was already a moribund form. However, in recent years the opera has undergone something of a reappraisal. Stanley Sadie considered it to show Mozart &quot;responding with music of restraint, nobility and warmth to a new kind of stimulus&quot;. The opera retains a reasonably high profile, and is in the lower reaches of the &#x27;Top 50&#x27; performed at major houses worldwide.

At the Salzburg Festival 2017, Peter Sellars directed his interpretation of the opera as &quot;a vision of peaceful coexistence&quot;, &quot;reaching far beyond the historical context&quot;. It was a coproduction with the Dutch National Opera, Amsterdam, and the Deutsche Oper Berlin. Conducted by Teodor Currentzis, it premiered on 27 July 2017 at the Felsenreitschule in Salzburg.

The opera was also performed as part of Glyndebourne&#x27;s 2017 summer festival. In 2019 the Los Angeles Opera put on the work for the first time in its history in an all new production, conducted by James Conlon and starring Russell Thomas in the title role and Elizabeth DeShong as Sesto. In the same year the opera was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and broadcast on 20 April 2019.

== Roles ==
== Instrumentation ==
The opera is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets (1 also basset clarinet and basset horn), 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani and strings. Basso continuo in &quot;recitativi secchi&quot; is made up of cembalo and violoncello. Period performance practice often uses a fortepiano.

== Synopsis ==
:Place and time: Ancient Rome, in the year 79.

=== Act 1 ===
Vitellia, daughter of the late emperor Vitellius (who had been deposed by Tito&#x27;s father Vespasian), wants revenge against Tito. She stirs up Tito&#x27;s vacillating friend Sesto, who is in love with her, to act against him (duet &quot;Come ti piace, imponi&quot;). But when she hears word that Tito has sent Berenice of Cilicia, of whom she was jealous, back to Jerusalem, Vitellia tells Sesto to delay carrying out her wishes, hoping Tito will choose her (Vitellia) as his empress (aria &quot;Deh, se piacer mi vuoi&quot;).

Tito, however, decides to choose Sesto&#x27;s sister Servilia to be his empress, and orders Annio (Sesto&#x27;s friend) to bear the message to Servilia (aria &quot;Del più sublime soglio&quot;). Since Annio and Servilia, unbeknownst to Tito, are in love, this news is very unwelcome to both (duet &quot;Ah, perdona al primo affetto&quot;). Servilia decides to tell Tito the truth but also says that if Tito still insists on marrying her, she will obey. Tito thanks the gods for Servilia&#x27;s truthfulness, and immediately forswears the idea of coming between her and Annio (aria &quot;Ah, se fosse intorno al trono&quot;).

In the meantime, however, Vitellia has heard the news about Tito&#x27;s interest in Servilia and is again boiling with jealousy. She urges Sesto to assassinate Tito. He agrees, singing one of the opera&#x27;s most famous arias (&quot;Parto, parto, ma tu, ben mio&quot; with basset clarinet obbligato). Almost as soon as he leaves, Annio and the guard Publio arrive to escort Vitellia to Tito, who has now chosen her as his empress. She is filled with feelings of guilt and worry over what she has sent Sesto to do.

Sesto, meanwhile, is at the Capitol wrestling with his conscience (recitativo &quot;Oh Dei, che smania è questa&quot;), as he and his accomplices set about burning it down. The other characters (except Tito) enter severally and react with horror to the burning Capitol. Sesto reenters and announces that he saw Tito slain, but Vitellia stops him from incriminating himself as the assassin. The others lament Tito in a slow, mournful conclusion to act one.

=== Act 2 ===
The act begins with Annio telling Sesto that Emperor Tito is in fact alive and has just been seen; in the smoke and chaos, Sesto had mistaken someone else for Tito. Sesto wants to leave Rome, but Annio persuades him not to (aria &quot;Torna di Tito a lato&quot;). Soon Publio arrives to arrest Sesto, bearing the news that it was one of Sesto&#x27;s co-conspirators who dressed himself in Tito&#x27;s robes and was stabbed, though not mortally, by Sesto. The Senate tries Sesto as Tito waits impatiently, sure that his friend will be exonerated; Publio expresses his doubts (aria &quot;Tardi s&#x27;avvede d&#x27;un tradimento&quot;) and leaves for the Senate. Annio begs Tito to show clemency towards his friend (aria &quot;Tu fosti tradito&quot;). Publio returns and announces that Sesto has been found guilty and that his death sentence only awaits Tito&#x27;s signature.

Attempting to obtain further details about the plot, the anguished Tito decides to send for Sesto first. Sesto takes all the guilt on himself and says he deserves death (rondo &quot;Deh, per questo istante solo&quot;), so Tito tells him he shall have it and sends him away. But after an extended inner struggle, Tito tears up the execution warrant for Sesto. He determines that, if the world will accuse him (Tito) of anything, it should charge him with showing too much mercy, rather than with having a vengeful heart (aria &quot;Se all&#x27;impero&quot;).

Vitellia at this time is wracked with guilt, but Servilia warns her that tears alone will not save Sesto (aria &quot;S&#x27;altro che lagrime&quot;). Vitellia finally decides to confess all to Tito, giving up her hopes of empire (rondo &quot;Non più di fiori&quot; with basset horn obbligato). In the amphitheatre, the condemned (including Sesto) are waiting to be thrown to the wild beasts. Tito is about to show mercy, when Vitellia offers her confession as the instigator of Sesto&#x27;s plot. Although shocked, the emperor includes her in the general clemency he offers (recitativo accompagnato &quot;Ma che giorno è mai questo?&quot;). The opera concludes with all the subjects praising the extreme generosity of Tito; he then asks that the gods cut short his days, should he ever cease to care for the good of Rome.

<doc id="615654" wikidata="Q707039" url="?curid=615654" title="Paul Morley">
<text>Paul Robert Morley (born 26 March 1957) is a British music journalist. He wrote for the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; from 1977 to 1983, and has since written for a wide range of publications and written his own books. He was a co-founder of the record label ZTT Records and was a member of the synthpop group Art of Noise. He has also been a band manager, promoter, and television presenter.

==Early life==
Paul Robert Morley was born on 26 March 1957 in Farnham, Surrey, and moved with his family to Reddish, Lancashire, before starting school. He was educated at Stockport Grammar School, at the time a direct grant grammar school. In his later teenage years, he would travel to London &quot;in search of music, and new experience&quot;.

==Career==
Morley wrote for three Manchester area magazines in the late 1970s, &quot;Penetration&quot;, &quot;Out There&quot;, and &quot;Girl Trouble&quot;. He then went on to write for &quot;NME&quot;, where he and colleagues such as Ian Penman developed an innovative style of music criticism that drew on critical theory and other non-musical sources. Whilst working at &quot;NME&quot;, he lived in NW London in between Swiss Cottage and Finchley Road. After leaving the &quot;NME&quot;, he was a regular contributor to &quot;Blitz&quot; magazine from 1984 to 1987, penning a monthly television column as well as a series of interviews.

For a time, Morley produced and managed Manchester punk band the Drones. However, he first came to wider attention with a brief appearance in the video for ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Look of Love&quot; (in which he mimes the words &quot;what&#x27;s that?&quot; in a call-and-response routine with singer Martin Fry), and some fame as co-founder, with Trevor Horn, of ZTT Records and electronic group Art of Noise.

Morley is credited with steering the marketing and promotion of the phenomenal early success of ZTT&#x27;s biggest act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, heavily influenced by Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft&#x27;s image for &quot;Alles ist gut&quot;. Although it has never been confirmed, it is claimed that Morley authored the provocative slogans on the band&#x27;s T-shirts (e.g. &quot;Frankie Say Arm the Unemployed&quot;, &quot;Frankie Say War! Hide Yourself&quot;).

He was the first presenter of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;The Late Show&quot;, and has appeared as a music pundit on a number of other programmes. For the short-lived Channel 4 arts strand &quot;Without Walls&quot; he wrote and presented a documentary on boredom. Morley regularly appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Review Show&quot;.

He was the focus of BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;How to Be a Composer&quot;, in which he spent a year at the Royal Academy of Music attempting to learn to compose classical music, despite being unable to read music or play an instrument.

Morley is the author of &quot;Words and Music: A History of Pop in the Shape of a City&quot;. The book is a journey through the history of pop; it seeks to trace the connection between Alvin Lucier&#x27;s experimental audio recording, &quot;I Am Sitting in a Room&quot; and Kylie Minogue&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Get You Out of My Head&quot;. A synthetic Kylie features as the central character of the book. The book was later turned into the hour-long epic musical track &quot;Raiding the 20th Century&quot; by DJ Food, which features Morley reading from his book and speculating on the cultural significance of the mashup, amidst the sounds of those very mashups.

His other books include &quot;Ask: The Chatter of Pop&quot; (a collection of his music journalism) and &quot;Nothing&quot;, concerning his father&#x27;s suicide and that of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis and such unhappy experiences as the time Morley spent at Stockport Grammar School.

Morley teamed up with the Auteurs&#x27; James Banbury to form the band Infantjoy and in 2005 released an album entitled &quot;Where the Night Goes&quot; on Sony BMG. &quot;With&quot;, an album featuring collaborations with Tunng, Isan and other musicians, was released in October 2006 on Morley and Banbury&#x27;s own label ServiceAV.

Morley is a fan of the jazz musician John Surman and conducted an interview with the artist for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

==Personal life==
Morley was married to Claudia Brücken with whom he has a son and a daughter.

He is the brother of filmmaker Carol Morley.

==Cultural references==
The Cure played a version of their song &quot;Grinding Halt&quot;, retitled for that performance as &quot;Desperate Journalist in Ongoing Meaningful Review Situation&quot;, on the John Peel radio show, with new lyrics parodying Morley&#x27;s writing style after an unfavourable review of their debut album &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot;. A 2010s post-punk band, Desperate Journalist, have adapted this as their name.

<text>Private George Lawrence Price (December 15, 1892 – November 11, 1918) was a Canadian soldier. He is traditionally recognized as the last soldier of the British Empire to be killed during the First World War.

== Early life ==
Price was born in Falmouth, Nova Scotia, on December 15, 1892, and raised on Church Street, in what is now Port Williams, Nova Scotia. George was the third child of James Ephraim and Annie Rose (Stephens) Price. He moved to Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, as a young man, where he was conscripted on October 15, 1917. He served with &quot;A&quot; Company of the 28th Battalion (Northwest), CEF, Canadian Expeditionary Force.

== November 11, 1918 ==
The 2nd Division&#x27;s 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade was selected to attack this day. From the 6th Brigade, the 28th &#x27;North-West&#x27; Battalion and the 31st Battalion/Alberta Regiment were chosen to lead the attack. The 28th Battalion had orders for November 11 to advance from Frameries (South of Mons) and continue to the village of Havre, securing all the bridges on the Canal du Centre. The battalion advanced rapidly starting at 4:00 a.m., pushing back light German resistance and they reached their position along the canal facing Ville-sur-Haine by 9:00 a.m. where the battalion received a message that all hostilities would cease at 11:00 a.m. Price and fellow soldier Art Goodmurphy were worried that the battalion&#x27;s position on the open canal bank was exposed to German positions on the opposite side of the canal where they could see bricks had been knocked out from house dormers to create firing positions. According to Goodmurphy, they decided on their own initiative to take a patrol of five men across the bridge to search the houses. Reaching the houses and checking them one by one, they discovered German soldiers mounting machine guns along a brick wall overlooking the canal. The Germans opened fire on the patrol with heavy machine guns but the Canadians were protected by the brick walls of one of the houses. Aware that they had been discovered and outflanked, the Germans began to retreat. A Belgian family in one of the houses warned the Canadians to be careful as they followed the retreating Germans. George Price was fatally shot in the right breast by a German sniper as he stepped out of the house into the street. He was pulled into one of the houses and treated by a young Belgian nurse who ran across the street to help, but died a minute later at 10:58 a.m., November 11, 1918. His death was just two minutes before the armistice came into effect at 11 a.m.

== Memorials ==
Price was originally buried in Havre Old Communal Cemetery, one of the cemeteries subsequently concentrated into the St Symphorien military cemetery, just southeast of Mons. Coincidentally, this is also the final resting place of John Parr and George Edwin Ellison, respectively the first and last British soldiers killed during the Great War. According to Veterans Affairs Canada, Price&#x27;s remains were reinterred at St Symphorien Military Cemetery after the war.

In 1968, on the 50th anniversary of his death and the armistice surviving members of his company traveled to Ville-sur-Haine and a memorial plaque was placed onto a wall of a house near the location of his death. The inscription, in English and then in French, reads in English:

The house has since been torn down, but the plaque has been placed on a brick and stone monument near the site where the house originally stood, and thus still near the place where he fell.

In 1991, the town of Ville-sur-Haine erected a new footbridge across the adjacent Canal du Centre, at . A plebiscite was held and on 11 November of that year the bridge was officially named the George Price Footbridge ().

On April 24, 2015, the local school in Ville-sur-Haine was renamed .

In 2016, Price&#x27;s medal set and the memorial plaque were donated to the Canadian War Museum.

On November 10, 2018, Canadian Governor General Julie Payette and other dignitaries attended the inauguration of a teardrop shaped monument in honour of Price, located in Ville-sur-Haine.

In Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, on August 26, 2021, a plaque was unveiled in Crescent Park commemorating &quot;The Last Commonwealth Soldier Killed In First World War&quot;.

<text>The Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey (ADAS; obs. code: 209) was an astronomical survey conducted in the early 2000s to search for comets and asteroids, with special emphasis on near-Earth objects. The Minor Planet Center directly credits ADAS with the discovery of more than 200 minor planets after 2001.

== Description ==

It was a joint venture between the Department of Astronomy of the University of Padua (using the Schmidt telescope at the Cima Ekar Observing Station) and the German Aerospace Center&#x27;s &quot;Institute of Space Sensor Technology and Planetary Exploration&quot; at Berlin-Adlershof, Germany. ADAS has IAU observatory code 209. Co-located with the Asiago Astrophysical Observatory, it conducted observations from 2001 to 2002. Principal investigators for the survey were Cesare Barbieri (at Padua/Asiago) and Gerhard Hahn (at DLR Berlin-Adlershof). The project worked in collaboration with the Uppsala-DLR Asteroid Survey (UDAS).

<text>Fernand Verhaegen (1883–1975) was a Belgian painter and etcher.

He was born in Marchienne-au-Pont, near Charleroi in Wallonia. He took courses at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts from 1900 to 1906 and there became friends with Rik Wouters and Edgard Tytgat. After graduation, he exhibited his works in Belgium and abroad (Biennale of Venice in 1920 and 1922). His style gradually evolved from impressionism and Belgian luminism to a synthetic form of capturing reality. In his later years, he came back to a personal form of impressionism.

Verhaegen specialized in painting Walloon folklore: Carnival of Binche (he was soon recognised as the painter of &quot;the Gilles of Binche&quot;), Doudou of Mons, Giants of Ath, Chinelles of Fosses, Chaudia of Leernes, Pasqueye, and so on. He also created a series of etchings devoted to the folklore in Wallonia. In his book about this artist, Robert Magremanne has named him &quot;the great master of the Walloon folklore&quot;. He died in Montigny-le-Tilleul in 1975.

Verhaegen&#x27;s works are in many museums of Belgium (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Ixelles, Liège, Mons) and abroad (Genève, Grenoble, Indianapolis).

<text>Urmia (; ) is the largest city in West Azerbaijan Province of Iran. In the Central District of Urmia County, it is capital of the province, the county, and the district. The city is situated near the borders of Iran with Turkey and Iraq.

The city lies at an altitude of above sea level along the Shahar River on the Urmia Plain. Lake Urmia, one of the world&#x27;s largest salt lakes, lies to the east of the city, and the border with Turkey lies to the west.

The city is the trading center for a fertile agricultural region where fruits (especially apples and grapes) and tobacco are grown. Even though the majority of the residents of Urmia are Muslims, the Christian history of Urmia is well preserved and is especially evident in the city&#x27;s many churches and cathedrals.

An important town by the 9th century, the city has had a diverse population which has at times included Muslims (Shias and Sunnis), Christians (Catholics, Protestants, Nestorians, and Orthodox), Jews, Baháʼís and Sufis. Around 1900 Christians made up more than 40% of the city&#x27;s population; however, in the next decades most of the Christians were either killed by the advancing Ottoman troops or in raids by Kurdish tribes or fled shortly after the end of the war.

Urmia, Takab and Piranshahr respectively have the highest number of registered provincial sites in the list of national sites.

== Etymology ==
Richard Nelson Frye suggested Urartian origin for the name, while T. Burrow connected the origin of the name Urmia to Indo-Iranian urmi- &quot;wave&quot; and urmya- &quot;undulating, wavy&quot;.

The name could also derive from the combination of the Assyrian Aramaic words &quot;Ur&quot; (; a common name for cities around Mesopotamia, meaning &quot;city&quot;) and &quot;Mia&quot; (), &quot;City of Water&quot; referring to the great Lake Urmia nearby. Compare Urhay, Ur of the Chaldees.

=== Variants and alternatives ===
As of 1921, Urmia was also called, &quot;Urumia&quot; and &quot;Urmi&quot;. During the Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979), the city was called &quot;Rezaiyeh&quot; (رضائیه) after Reza Shah, the dynasty&#x27;s founder, whose name ultimately derives from the Islamic concept of &quot;rida&quot; via the Eighth Imam in Twelver Shia Islam, Ali al-Ridha.

In his seyahatname, Evliya Çelebi referred to the city as (), also mentioning that the Mongols called the city (), Persians (), and some historians (), which he justified by the considerable amount of Turkoman awliya in the city.

Due to the city&#x27;s contact with many ethnic groups and cultures throughout its history, the name of the city has many linguistic variants:
* 
*, or 
*

== History ==

According to Vladimir Minorsky, there were villages in the Urmia Plain as early as 2000BC, with their civilization under the influence of the Kingdom of Van. Excavations of the ancient ruins near Urmia led to the discovery of utensils that date to the 20thcentury BC. In ancient times, the west bank of Urmia Lake was part of Gilzan, and in the 9thcentury BC an independent government ruled there, which later joined the Urartu or Manna empire; in the 8thcentury BC, the area was a vassal of the Asuzh government until it joined the Median Empire.

Assyrians who did survive the invasion of Baghdad by Timur fled through northern Iraq up into the Hakkari Mountains to the west of Lake Urmia and the area remained as their homeland until the 19th century.

During the Safavid era, the neighboring Ottoman Turks, who were the archrivals of the Safavids, made several incursions into the city and captured it on more than one occasion, but the Safavids successfully regained control over the area. When in 1622, during the reign of Safavid king AbbasI (1588–1629) Qasem Sultan Afshar was appointed governor of Mosul, he was forced to leave his office shortly afterwards due to the outbreak of a plague. He moved to the western part of Azerbaijan, and became the founder of the Afshar community of Urmia. The city was the capital of the Urmia Khanate from 1747 to 1865. The first monarch of Iran&#x27;s Qajar dynasty, Agha Muhammad Khan, was crowned in Urmia in 1795.

Due to the presence of a substantial Christian minority at the end of the 19thcentury, Urmia was also chosen as the site of the first Christian missionaries from the United States in Iran in 1835 led by Justin Perkins (1805–1869) with Asahel Grant (1807–1844); and followed by Fidelia Fiske (1816–1864), Joseph Gallup Cochran (1817–1871), and Joseph Plumb Cochran (1855–1905). Another mission was soon underway in nearby Tabriz as well. During World War I, the population was estimated by Dr.Caujole to be 30,000 people, a quarter of which (7,500) were Assyrians and 1,000 Jews.

During the 19th century, the region became the center of a short-lived Assyrian renaissance with many books and newspapers being published in Syriac. Urmia was also the seat of a Chaldean diocese.

During late 1914 Ottoman forces under the command of Enver Pasha stepped up clandestine activity in the region with the aim of committing the Ottoman Empire to war. During World War I, the city changed hands several times between the Russians and the Ottoman troops and their Kurdish allies in the following two years. In 1914, before the declaration of war against Russia, Ottoman forces crossed the border into Persia and destroyed Christian villages. Large-scale attacks in late September and October 1914 targeted many Assyrian villages, and the attackers neared Urmia. Due to Ottoman attacks, thousands of Christians living along the border fled to Urmia.

Many Christians fled during the Russian withdrawal from Azerbaijan at the beginning of January 1915, and 20,000 to 25,000 refugees were left stranded in Urmia. Nearly 18,000 Christians sought shelter in the city&#x27;s Presbyterian and Lazarist missions. Although there was reluctance to attack the missionary compounds, many died of disease. Between February and May (when the Ottoman forces pulled out), there was a campaign of mass execution, looting, kidnapping, and extortion against Christians in Urmia. More than 100 men were arrested at the Lazarist compound, and dozens (including Mar Dinkha, bishop of Tergawer) were executed on 23 and 24 February.

The Russian army advanced later in 1915. After Russia&#x27;s withdrawal as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution, about 5,000 Assyrian and Armenian militia policed the area, but they frequently abused their power and killed Muslims without provocation. 

From February to July 1918, the region was engulfed by ethnic violence. On 22 February, local Muslims and the Persian governor began an uprising against the Christian militias in Urmia. The better-organized Christians, led by Agha Petros, brutally crushed the uprising; hundreds (possibly thousands) were killed. On 16 March, Mar Shimun and many of his bodyguards were killed by the Kurdish chieftain Simko Shikak, probably at the instigation of Persian officials fearing Assyrian separatism, after they met to discuss an alliance. Assyrians went on a killing and looting spree; unable to find Simko, they murdered Persian officials and inhabitants. The Kurds responded by massacring Christians, regardless of denomination or ethnicity. Christians were massacred in Salmas in June and in Urmia in early July, and many Assyrian women were abducted.

Christian militias in Azerbaijan were no match for the Ottoman army when it invaded in July 1918. Tens of thousands of Ottoman and Persian Assyrians fled south to Hamadan, where the British Dunsterforce was garrisoned, on 18 July to escape Ottoman forces approaching Urmia under Ali İhsan Sâbis. The Ottoman invasion was followed by killings of Christians, including Chaldean archbishop Toma Audo, and the sacking of Urmia.

==Demographics==
=== Ethnic composition ===

The city has been home to various ethnic groups during its history. The population of Urmia in the early Islamic period was Christian. In late 19th century, George Curzon reported a population of 30 to 40 thousand people, chiefly Afshars, Nestorians, Jews, and Armenians, while other sources also referred to an additional Persian community. At the beginning of the 20thcentury, the city had a significant Christian minority (Assyrians and Armenians). According to Macuch, and Ishaya, the city was the spiritual capital of the Assyrians, who were influenced by four Christian missions that had been established in the city in the period from 1830 to the end of World War I. A large number of the Assyrians and Armenians were killed in 1914 during the Armenian and Assyrian genocides, which resulted in a change in the city&#x27;s demographics. In the fourteenth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica from 1929, the town&#x27;s population was roughly estimated to be 45 thousand before the war, mainly being Turkish with Armenian and Nestorian minorities. During the era of Reza Shah Pahlavi, Iranian Assyrians were invited to return to the region, and several thousand did return. There are around 5,000 Assyrians remaining in the city.

Until the Iran crisis of 1946 and the Establishment of the State of Israel in 1947, several thousand Jews also lived Urmia, and their language (Lishán Didán) is still spoken by an ageing community in Israel.

According to the Federal Research Division of Library of Congress, ethnic Azeris form around 40% of the population of Urmia region. The majority of the city&#x27;s residents are Azerbaijanis, with a large minority of Kurds, and a smaller number of Assyrians, and Armenians, as well as Persian-speakers who moved to the city mostly for employment.

The majority of the population can speak the official language of Iran, Persian, in addition to their own native tongue.

=== Religion ===

The city is the archiepiscopal see of the Eastern Catholic Metropolitan Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Urmyā, which has a suffragan in Salmas. There are also Protestants, Church of the East adherents and Armenian Orthodox. There are four churches in the central part of the city, two being Assyrian Church of the East, one Armenian, and one Chaldean.

When 17th-century explorer Evliya Çelebi visited the region, the city&#x27;s Muslim population was mostly Sunni and not yet converted to Shia Islam. Around 1900, Christians made up more than 40% of the city&#x27;s population; however, most of the Christians were either killed when the Ottoman Empire invaded Qajar Iran and committed genocide against Urmia&#x27;s Assyrian and Armenian population or fled shortly after the end of the war. Approximately 15,000 Assyrians reside in northern Iran, in Urmia and various Assyrian villages in the surrounding area. The Christian history of Urmia is well preserved and is especially evident in the city&#x27;s many churches and cathedrals.

===Population===
Urmia is the 10th-most populous city in Iran. At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 577,307 in 153,570 households. The following census in 2011 counted 667,499 people in 197,749 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 736,224 people in 225,050 households.

== Parks and touristic centres ==
The tourist attractions of the city of Urmia include many parks and coastal villages lying on or near the shores of Lake Urmia. The oldest park in Urmia, called Park-e Saat, was established in the first Pahlavi era. Urmia&#x27;s largest park is Ellar Bagi Park (Azerbaijani &quot;People&#x27;s Garden&quot;) along the Shahar Chayi, or the &quot;City River&quot;.

== Climate ==
Urmia&#x27;s climate is cold semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;BS&quot;), bordering on humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfa&quot;, Trewartha: &quot;Dc&quot;), with cold winters, mild springs, hot dry summers, and cool autumns. Precipitation is heavily concentrated in late autumn, winter (mostly in the form of snow), and especially spring, while precipitation is scarce in summer. Temperatures in Urmia are much colder than most of the remainder of Iran. The drought of Urmia Lake will have a negative impact on the climate of the region.

Being on the downwind and rain shadow side of the Zagros Mountains, its winters are relatively drier and less snowy than Hakkari&#x27;s (to the west) in southeastern Turkey due to the foehn effect.

== Sport ==

Sports are an important part of Urmia&#x27;s culture. The most popular sport in Urmia is volleyball. Urmia is considered Iran&#x27;s volleyball capital, and that is because of the ranks that Shahrdari Urmia VC got in Iranian Volleyball Super League and for the great volleyball players who play on the Iran men&#x27;s national volleyball team (such as Saed Marouf, Abdolreza Alizadeh, and Milad Ebadipour) and first-class coaches in Iran. Recently, Urmia has also been called &quot;the city of volleyball lovers&quot; by the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (International Volleyball Federation, FIVB) official website.

The 2010 Asian Men&#x27;s Cup Volleyball Championship was held in Ghadir Arena in Urmia, 2012 WAFF Futsal Championship, and the 2012 Asian Junior Men&#x27;s Volleyball Championship was also held in Urmia. It is also one of the venues of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Men&#x27;s Nations League.

== Culture ==

Azerbaijanis hold festivals and ceremonies such as Nowruz and Eid al-Adha like other Iranian ethnic groups with small differences. Ashik music is one of the features of the Turkish speaking people of the world. It has different versions in Iran. Meanwhile, as many experts of this art testify the Urmia Ashik, is the most original and oldest version in the world, which has preserved its origin until the present day. Ashik music has its unique styles. As a piece of the culture of Azerbaijan, Urmia Ashik music has been registered in Iran&#x27;s national heritage.

<text>Percy Cunningham Mather (; 9 December 1882 – 24 May 1933) was a pioneer British Protestant Christian missionary to China, the second China Inland Mission missionary to Xinjiang.

Mather was born in Fleetwood, Lancashire, England in 1884, the son of a railway employee and an Irish nurse. Mather went into railway service like his father. In 1903 he was converted to Christianity through the ministry of J. H. Doddrell of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. Mather soon became a Sunday school teacher and local preacher. While his ordination was delayed, he learned about the China Inland Mission (CIM) and decided to go to China after assisting his sister financially to get an education.

In 1910 Mather sailed to Shanghai, then moved up the Yangtze river to attend the Anqing language school. Afterward he was stationed in Ningguo in Anhui Province. Mather was influenced by reading Roland Allen&#x27;s book, &quot;Missionary Methods: St. Paul&#x27;s or Ours?&quot; and then he volunteered to join George Hunter in Ürümqi, Xinjiang, arriving there in 1914. Until 1926 the two itinerated in Xinjiang and Outer Mongolia. When Mather joined him, Hunter had a work among all the different peoples of Central Asia. Mather joined full heartedly in the work, but his specific focus was towards the Mongols. Quickly he set about learning Mongol, but the only Mongol teacher he could find in the city with extra time was in the local jail. Afterward he produced a grammar, and a dictionary in Oirat Mongolian, as well as a grammar and dictionary of Manchu, but they were never published, and it is unclear what became of the manuscripts.

Following intensive medical studies while on furlough in 1927, Mather returned to China to concentrate on medical work as well as on translations, grammars, and dictionaries of Mongolian languages.

Mather was caught up in hostilities in China during the Chinese Civil War, and was accused of political intrigue. He died on 24 May 1933 of typhus, during the siege of Ürümqi, when caring for people wounded during the Kumul Rebellion led by Ma Zhongying. He was buried in Ürümqi.

<text>A candidate, or nominee, is a prospective recipient of an award or honor, or a person seeking or being considered for some kind of position. For example, one can be a candidate for membership in a group or election to an office, in which case a candidate selection occurs.

&quot;Nomination&quot; is part of the process of selecting a candidate for either election to an office by a political party, or the bestowing of an honor or award. This person is called a &quot;nominee&quot;, though &quot;nominee&quot; is often used interchangeably with &quot;candidate&quot;. A presumptive nominee is a person or organization whose nomination is considered inevitable or highly likely. The phenomenon of being a candidate in a race for either a party nomination or for electoral office is called &quot;candidacy&quot;. The term &quot;presumptive candidate&quot; may be used to describe someone who is predicted to be a formal candidate.

==Etymology==
&quot;Candidate&quot; is a derivative of the Latin (‘shining white’). In ancient Rome, men seeking political office would usually wear the &quot;toga candida&quot;, a toga chalked and bleached to be bright white at speeches, debates, conventions, and other public functions.

==In the Roman Catholic Church==
Individuals who wish to be received into the membership of the Catholic Church who have been baptized in another mainstream Christian denomination are known as &quot;candidates&quot;; their reception into the Catholic Church is done through a profession of faith, followed by the reception of Holy Communion and Confirmation. In contrast, those persons who have never received the sacrament of baptism are, as a matter of Catholic canon law, considered non-Christians and if they are preparing to become a member of the Catholic Church (through the church process called the Christian Initiation of Adults, they are known as catechumens.

==Candidates in elections==
In the context of elections for public office in a representational partisan democracy, a candidate who has been selected by a political party is normally said to be the nominee of that party. The party&#x27;s selection (that is, the nomination) is typically accomplished either based on one or more primary elections according to the rules of the party and any applicable election laws.

Candidates are called &quot;incumbents&quot; if they are already serving in the office for which they are seeking re-election, or &quot;challengers&quot;, if they are seeking to replace an incumbent.

In the context of elections for public office in a direct democracy, a candidate can be nominated by any eligible person—and if parliamentary procedures are used, the nomination has to be seconded, i.e., receive agreement from a second person.

===&quot;Spitzenkandidat&quot;===

In German politics, the person at the head of an electoral list is called the &quot;Spitzenkandidat&quot; (&quot;lead candidate&quot;). By convention, this means that this person (normally the party leader) will be elected to lead the government if their party wins the election. Various other countries with a parliamentary democracy have the same system.

In 2014, the major groups represented in the European Parliament and the European Council agreed to apply this process to determine the next President of the European Commission, as a way of the Council &quot;taking account of the results of the European Parliament election&quot; as required by the Union treaties. This led to the appointment and confirmation of Jean-Claude Juncker.

In , parties nominate a &quot;Chancellor candidate&quot;.

<text>Nomination is part of the process of selecting a candidate for either election to a public office, or the bestowing of an honor or award. A collection of nominees narrowed from the full list of candidates is a short list.

==Political office==
In the context of elections for public office, a candidate who has been selected to represent or is endorsed by a political party is said to be the party&#x27;s nominee. The process of selection may be based on one or more primary elections or by means of a political party convention or caucus, according to the rules of the party and any applicable election laws. In some countries the process is called preselection.

Public statements of support for a candidate&#x27;s nomination are known as endorsements or testimonials.

In some jurisdictions the nominee of a recognized political party is entitled to appear on the general election ballot paper. Candidates who are endorsed by a political party may be required to submit a nominating petition in order to gain ballot access. In others all candidates have to meet nomination rules criteria to stand.

== Parliamentary procedure ==
In parliamentary procedure, a nomination is basically a motion to fill a blank in a motion &quot;that _____ be elected.&quot; Nominations are used to provide choices of candidates for election to office. After nominations have been made, the assembly proceeds to its method of voting used for electing officers.

=== Motions relating to nominations ===
There are a number of motions relating to nominations. They include the motions to make, close, and reopen nominations, and motions to designate the method of making nominations. The motion to select a method of nominating is also treated as filling a blank, in which votes are taken on suggested methods of nomination in the following order: 
* by the chair
* from the floor (open nominations)
* by a committee
* by ballot
* by mail
* by petition
Not all of these methods may be suitable for a particular organization.

=== Legitimate use of closing nominations ===
Normally, nominations are closed when no one else wants to make a nomination. This is done without a motion (using a form of unanimous consent). A motion to close nominations cannot be used to prevent a member from making a nomination. A legitimate use of a motion to close nominations is that some members are obviously delaying the election by nominating persons who have no chance of being elected. It takes a two-thirds vote to close nominations, but only a majority vote to reopen them.

==Awards and honours==

The rules of a number of awards or honours require the nomination of candidates. The rules for who and how candidates are nominated vary with each award or honour, as do the processes of selecting from the candidates.

For some awards and honours, being nominated or shortlisted is itself considered an honour, as in the case of the Academy Awards and other similar events, and with events such as book and arts awards. In 2015 there were 273 candidates nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, while 9000 are nominated for the more satirical Ig Nobel Prizes every year.

<text>Le Livre des tournois (&quot;Traicte de la Forme de Devis d&#x27;un Tournoi&quot;) or King René&#x27;s Tournament Book is a treatise describing rules for tournaments by the French prince René d&#x27;Anjou. It is best known from what appears to be Rene&#x27;s own illuminated copy from the 1460s, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris (MS Fr. 2695) with illustrations, or at least the drawings before colouring, attributed to Barthélemy d&#x27;Eyck.

The description given in the book is different from that of the pas d&#x27;armes held at Razilly and Saumur; conspicuously absent are the allegorical and chivalresque ornamentations that were in vogue at the time. René instead emphasizes he is reporting on ancient tournament customs of France, Germany and the Low Countries, combining them in a new suggestion on how to hold a tournament.
The tournament described is a melee fought by two sides. Individual jousts are only briefly mentioned.

In the original BnF manuscript van Eyck did the line drawings, possibly intended as preparatory only, which were later coloured either by him or by another artist. There are twenty-six full and double page illustrations. The BNF also has three illuminated copies of the manuscript made shortly after the original, MS Fr. 2692 is dated to 1488/9, Fr. 2693 to 1480–1488, and Fr. 2696 to c. 1483, plus one early modern copy, Fr. 2694 (17th century).

Formerly, the MS Fr. 2695 manuscript was regarded as directly inspired by a series of tournaments held at the Anjou court at Nancy, Saumur and Tarascon between 1445 and 1450, but it is now considered somewhat younger, dating to the 1460s, not least because the text makes several critical allusions the &quot;Traité des anciens et nouveaux tournois&quot; written by Antoine de La Sale in 1459. Also, the emblem of the duke of Bourbon is represented as including two white dogs, which had fallen out of use in the 1420s and were only re-introduced by Jean II of Bourbon in 1457. Finally, the paper itself was dated to the 1450s.
According to Gautier (2009), the manuscript would have been redacted during 1462–69, when René was at Angers. It was most likely complete before 1471, as an inventory of Angers castle in 1471/2 mentions a &quot;cayez de papier en grant volume, ouquel est le commencement d&#x27;un tournoy&quot;, which has been identified with this manuscript.
The manuscript later came into possession of Marie of Luxembourg (d. 1546) and later again of Louis Nicolas Fouquet (d. 1705), then passing to Louis François de Bourbon-Conti and finally to Louis-César de La Baume Le Blanc de La Vallière who in 1766 sold it to the royal library of Louis XV (which became the BNF after 1789).

<text>The Tucson Garbage Project is an archaeological and sociological study instituted in 1973 by Dr. William Rathje in the city of Tucson in the Southwestern American state of Arizona. This project is sometimes referred to as the &quot;garbology project&quot;.

==History==
Dr. Rathje (also known affectionately as &quot;Captain Planet&quot;) and his students studied the contents of Tucson residents&#x27; waste to examine patterns of consumption. Quantitative data from bins was compared with information known about the residents who owned them. The results have shown that information people freely volunteered about their consumption habits did not always tally with the contents of their waste bins. For example, alcohol consumption was proven to be significantly higher in reality than in the questionnaires completed by the people studied. Such findings have highlighted the difference between people&#x27;s self-reported and actual behaviors.

Such findings cast doubt on the reliability of historical record when applied to archaeological sites in general and follow a processualist approach stressing the benefits of scientific analysis. 

The project has since expanded to other American cities and has undertaken excavation of landfill sites. Among many of the important results of Rathje, were his conclusion on landfill degradation and consumer waste patterns. For example, an intuitive idea that existed before Rathje&#x27;s work is that people will waste less expensive food in times of economic recession. Rathje&#x27;s landfill project proved this idea to be incorrect: when resources are scarce, people tend to buy larger quantities of -for example- beef-meat, when they are on sale, only to end up throwing it out again as they have bought too much to consume before the expiration dates. Rathje&#x27;s data shows that waste beef is far more common during an economic recession.
Another idea Rathje shattered is that of paper degradation in landfills. For a long time, it was believed that paper is a relatively safe and environmentally friendly waste product, degrading quickly in landfills. Rathje showed, however, that paper is typically a &quot;bad degrader&quot;: newspapers dumped in landfills as much as over half a century ago, turn up again as fresh and as readable as the day they were issued.

<text>&quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; (English: &quot;Grândola, Swarthy Town&quot;) is a Portuguese song by singer-songwriter José Afonso, recorded in 1971. It was originally released in Afonso&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Cantigas do Maio&quot; and later released in an EP of the same name in 1973, and as a single in 1977.

&quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; became an iconic song in Portugal after being used as a radio-broadcast signal by the Portuguese Armed Forces Movement during their military coup operation on the morning of 25 April 1974, which led to the Carnation Revolution and the transition to democracy in Portugal. It has since been considered a symbol of the revolution and anti-fascism.

== Composition and structure ==
José Afonso was inspired to write a song about the town of Grândola after performing at the &quot;Sociedade Musical Fraternidade Operária Grandolense&quot;, a working-class musical fraternity in Grândola, on 17 May 1964. Afonso created the lyrics and melody while driving back home from Grândola. In the car with him were guitarists Carlos Paredes and Fernando Alvim.

&quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; is an a cappella song, sung in the style of cante alentejano, which tells about the fraternity among the people of Grândola, a town in the Alentejo region of Portugal. Each quatrain of the song is first sung solo, and is followed by a quatrain that repeats the same lines in reverse order, this time sung by a choir.

== Recording ==
The recording of the album &quot;Cantigas do Maio&quot;, in which &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; was included, took place at the Strawberry Studio in Château d&#x27;Hérouville, in Hérouville, France, in October 1971. It was arranged and produced by José Mário Branco, another famous Portuguese singer-songwriter of &quot;canções de intervenção&quot; (Portuguese protest songs), whom Afonso had met and befriended in 1969, in France.

The footsteps that can be heard throughout the song marking the rhythm were recorded on an early morning, on a gravel floor outside of the studio building. Branco, Afonso and two other musicians, Francisco Fanhais and Carlos Correia, went out at 3 a.m. to do the recording, in order to avoid the noise caused by passing cars on a nearby road. Later that day, in the afternoon, the vocals were recorded in the studio.

==Live performances==
The song was performed live by José Afonso for the first time at a show in Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, on 10 May 1972. The show was part of an event organized by students involved in anti-Francoism.

On 29 March 1974, Afonso participated in a concert event at the Coliseu dos Recreios in Lisbon, called &quot;First Meeting of the Portuguese Song&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Primeiro Encontro da Canção Portuguesa&quot;). This was an event sponsored by Casa da Imprensa in which several folk singer-songwriters and musicians with anti-Estado Novo inclinations participated. The state censorship still operated in the event, and Afonso was forbidden from performing some of his songs with more political messages, such as &quot;Venham Mais Cinco&quot; and &quot;A Morte Saiu à Rua&quot;. &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot;, however, was not seen as a subversive song and was allowed to be performed.

Afonso was the last performer of the evening and sang &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot;, which was received with enthusiasm by the audience. In a report covering the event, agents of the State Secretariat of Information and Tourism who were in the attendance described Afonso&#x27;s performance:

«Finally José Afonso also sang. But first all the artists joined their arms and began swinging their bodies from left to right, to which they were joined by the audience. He performed &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; and &quot;Milho Verde&quot; and again &quot;Grândola&quot;, accompanied by the audience, which screamed, we think intentionally, the line &quot;o povo é quem mais ordena&quot; (&quot;the people are the ones who order the most&quot;). The ending can be considered apotheotic, with light effects focusing on the artists and the audience.»

==Role in the Carnation Revolution==
In the early 1970s, a number of José Afonso&#x27;s songs were banned by the Estado Novo censors from being publicly played or broadcast, as they were considered to be associated with Communism. &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; was not one of the banned songs.

Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho, the chief strategist of the military coup by the Armed Forces Movement (MFA), needed a signal that could be transmitted nationwide via radio to all the military officers of the MFA, to indicate the start of their operation. His initial idea was to transmit Afonso&#x27;s song &quot;Venham Mais Cinco&quot;, but João Paulo Diniz, a radio host who participated in the planning, convinced Saraiva de Carvalho that it was not a good idea since the song was forbidden by censors and that would raise suspicion.

Two signals were then decided: the first would be Paulo de Carvalho&#x27;s &quot;E Depois do Adeus&quot; (which was the Portuguese entry in the Eurovision Song Contest of 1974) and the second would be Afonso&#x27;s &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot;. The plan was to transmit the first signal at 22:55 on 24 April, and the second signal between 00:00 and 01:00 on 25 April.

&quot;E Depois do Adeus&quot; was aired by the Emissores Associados de Lisboa at 22:55, on 24 April 1974. &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; was afterwards aired by Rádio Renascença, at 00:20 on 25 April 1974. None of the radio hosts involved were aware that there was a plan for a coup d&#x27;état.

After the broadcasts, strategic points in Portugal were occupied by the MFA troops. The military coup operation was successful and resulted in the Carnation Revolution, which overthrew the dictatorship of the Estado Novo regime and marked the beginning of the transition to democracy in Portugal.

==Legacy==
=== Political legacy ===
&quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot; continues to be sung in celebrations of the Carnation Revolution every year in Portugal, on 25 April.

On 15 February 2013, the Prime Minister of Portugal was interrupted by a rendition of the song in the Assembly of the Republic (Portuguese Parliament). Protesters in the Assembly&#x27;s public galleries, unhappy with the contemporary social and economic policies, expressed their discontent through the song.

In September 2020, protests against the Portuguese far-right party Chega in Évora were marked by crowds singing &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot;.

=== Cover versions ===
Various artists from around the world have recorded cover versions of &quot;Grândola, Vila Morena&quot;. Portuguese artists who have covered the song include Amália Rodrigues, Dulce Pontes, Roberto Leal, María do Ceo and UHF. Internationally, it has been covered by Nara Leão, Franz Josef Degenhardt, Charlie Haden, Agit-Prop, Betagarri, Autoramas, Reincidentes and Garotos Podres. 

A version by Spanish singers Cecilia Krull and Pablo Alborán is included in Season 5 of the Netflix series &quot;Money Heist&quot;.

There also exists an Esperanto version by singer-songwriter Gianfranco Molle, in his 1979 album ´Horo da opozicio´, titled &#x27;Grandula, Urbeto Bruna´.

<text>Steganalysis is the study of detecting messages hidden using steganography; this is analogous to cryptanalysis applied to cryptography.

== Overview ==
The goal of steganalysis is to identify suspected packages, determine whether or not they have a payload encoded into them, and, if possible, recover that payload. 

Unlike cryptanalysis, in which intercepted data contains a message (though that message is encrypted), steganalysis generally starts with a pile of suspect data files, but little information about which of the files, if any, contain a payload. The steganalyst is usually something of a forensic statistician, and must start by reducing this set of data files (which is often quite large; in many cases, it may be the entire set of files on a computer) to the subset most likely to have been altered.

== Basic techniques ==
The problem is generally handled with statistical analysis. A set of unmodified files of the same type, and ideally from the same source (for example, the same model of digital camera, or if possible, the &quot;same&quot; digital camera; digital audio from a CD MP3 files have been &quot;ripped&quot; from; etc.) as the set being inspected, are analyzed for various statistics. Some of these are as simple as spectrum analysis, but since most image and audio files these days are compressed with lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, they also attempt to look for inconsistencies in the way this data has been compressed. For example, a common artifact in JPEG compression is &quot;edge ringing&quot;, where high-frequency components (such as the high-contrast edges of black text on a white background) distort neighboring pixels. This distortion is predictable, and simple steganographic encoding algorithms will produce artifacts that are detectably unlikely.

One case where detection of suspect files is straightforward is when the original, unmodified carrier is available for comparison. Comparing the package against the original file will yield the differences caused by encoding the payload—and, thus, the payload can be extracted.

== Advanced techniques ==

=== Noise floor consistency analysis ===
In some cases, such as when only a single image is available, more complicated analysis techniques may be required. In general, steganography attempts to make distortion to the carrier indistinguishable from the carrier&#x27;s noise floor. In practice, however, this is often improperly simplified to deciding to make the modifications to the carrier resemble white noise as closely as possible, rather than analyzing, modeling, and then consistently emulating the actual noise characteristics of the carrier. In particular, many simple steganographic systems simply modify the least-significant bit (LSB) of a sample; this causes the modified samples to have not only different noise profiles than unmodified samples, but also for their LSBs to have different noise profiles than could be expected from analysis of their higher-order bits, which will still show some amount of noise. Such LSB-only modification can be detected with appropriate algorithms, in some cases detecting encoding densities as low as 1% with reasonable reliability.

== Further complications ==

=== Encrypted payloads ===
Detecting a probable steganographic payload is often only part of the problem, as the payload may have been encrypted first. Encrypting the payload is not always done solely to make recovery of the payload more difficult. Most strong ciphers have the desirable property of making the payload appear indistinguishable from uniformly-distributed noise, which can make detection efforts more difficult, and save the steganographic encoding technique the trouble of having to distribute the signal energy evenly (but see above concerning errors emulating the native noise of the carrier).

=== Barrage noise ===

If inspection of a storage device is considered very likely, the steganographer may attempt to barrage a potential analyst with, effectively, misinformation. This may be a large set of files encoded with anything from random data, to white noise, to meaningless drivel, to deliberately misleading information. The encoding density on these files may be slightly higher than the &quot;real&quot; ones; likewise, the possible use of multiple algorithms of varying detectability should be considered. The steganalyst may be forced into checking these decoys first, potentially wasting significant time and computing resources. The downside to this technique is it makes it much more obvious that steganographic software was available, and was used.

== Conclusions and further action ==
Obtaining a warrant or taking other actions based solely on steganalytic evidence is a very dicey proposition unless a payload has been completely recovered &quot;and decrypted&quot;, because otherwise all the analyst has is a statistic indicating that a file &quot;may&quot; have been modified, and that modification &quot;may&quot; have been the result of steganographic encoding. Because this is likely to frequently be the case, steganalytic suspicions will often have to be backed up with other investigative techniques.

<text>The comic book series &quot;Elfquest&quot;, created by Wendy and Richard Pini, features a race of elves on the World of Two Moons, searching for their origins and place in the world.

==Origin==
The elves are descended from a spacegoing race known as the High Ones, who were accompanied by small workers (later to evolve into trolls) and winged flitters (later to become the Preservers). One isolated group of High Ones, seeking a new world to dwell in, encountered an unknown planet with two moons inhabited by humans.

Scanning the planet from orbit, they learned of human legends which suggested that other High Ones had once visited the planet. Intending to communicate with the humans in order to learn more, the High Ones reshaped their bodies into elfin form and their spaceship into a Medieval-style palace. Just as they were about to land, the troll servants rebelled and caused the ship to jump back in time 20,000 years (as stated on the official &quot;Elfquest&quot; timeline), to an age when humans were at a paleolithic stage of development. The primitive humans killed some of the elves and drove the rest away. The preservers followed the elves while the trolls, freed from their masters, established underground colonies.

Thus the elves were both the cause and the result of a time paradox, because the legends the High Ones had seen were about their own time-shifted descendants.

Most of the High Ones died out, and their descendants forgot their origins completely until Cutter&#x27;s quest led to their rediscovery.

==Physical characteristics==
While the Original High Ones (including the partial remnant of High Ones within Glider elves) are only a headlength shorter than humans and much slenderer, the Wolfriders and the Go-Backs tribes are between one half and one third of a human. The elves of &quot;Elfquest&quot; are broadly human in appearance, but are distinguished from humans by the following characteristics:
* Ears are the most obvious elfin characteristic. They are much bigger than human ears, and prominently pointed. Their tips are supported by prominent bony ridges on either side of the skull.
* Eyes are larger than human eyes, with slanted eyelids.
* Cheekbones are high and prominent.
* Noses are smaller and narrower.
* Hair is much finer and silkier than human hair (Wolfriders&#x27; hair is coarser than that of pure elves, due to their wolf blood).
* Facial hair: None, except in the case of male Wolfriders, who develop &quot;face fur&quot; - mutton chops, beards and moustaches - after living for several centuries.
* Fingers and toes: Only four digits on each hand and foot.
* Skin color: Elves generally exhibit the same range of variation as humans. The Sun Folk, adapted to desert conditions, have medium to dark brown skin. Wolfriders have adapted to cold temperate climates; they are pale pink or ruddy, but tan in hotter climates. Go-backs have a lighter complexion from living in Abode&#x27;s northern mountains. Gliders - who mostly lived inside a mountain - are fair to pallid.

==Tribes==
Subsequent to their arrival on the World of Two Moons, the elves splintered into a number of different tribes. These tribes differ considerably in culture and even physical appearance but all of them have some kind of animal that they use and that can be related to a form of tribe totem.

===Wolfriders===

The Wolf-riders are a hunter-gatherer society of nocturnal elves who possess wolf blood, which gives them characteristics unique from other tribes. In addition to having keener senses, they are mortal. Wolfriders live by a code of conduct called &quot;The Way&quot;. It is based on the natural cycle of the wolf; it glorifies the wild freedom of a hunter&#x27;s life, and the &quot;now&quot; of wolf-thought.

===Sun Folk===

The Sun Folk are a peaceful, largely agrarian desert-dwelling tribe whose dark skin helps protect them from the powerful sunlight of their home, a village called Sorrow&#x27;s End. The Sun Folk can work soft metals, such as copper, silver, and gold. They are excellent weavers and are capable of building elaborate homes of sun-dried clay.

===Gliders===
The Gliders are a tall race of elves, almost all of whom possess the power of gliding. To avoid human persecution they have cloistered themselves inside the hollowed-out Blue Mountain, devoting themselves to art and contemplation. In the process they have become arrogant and decadent, none more so than the black-robed Winnowill. Because they had lived so long in claustrophobic isolation, the Gliders ceased to Recognize and therefore ceased having children. Eventually, they found themselves worshiped by a human tribe that dwelt at the foot of Blue Mountain. A race of giant hawks were bred to bear the Chosen Eight, the elfin messengers who bore gifts to the humans, received tokens and live offerings of human tribe members, and hunted for the other Gliders.

===Go-Backs===

The Go-Backs, as their name suggests, desire to return to the Palace, but the Palace had long been claimed by King Guttlekraw&#x27;s trolls, enemies of the elves. In response, the Go-Backs have become a race of brutally barbaric warriors, constantly fighting the trolls until the war had become their &quot;meat and milk&quot;. Their life was short and harsh, and they opted not to use magic because it made life deceptively soft. They value offspring, but believe in a warrior&#x27;s early death. The Go-Backs had domesticated giant elks for use as mounts, and primarily dwell in lodges built into the mountains. Unknown to the Go-Backs, their chief Kahvi actually has long hidden Wolf-rider blood.

In the German edition, the Go-backs are called snow-elves.

===Wave-dancers===
The Wave-dancers are a tribe of elves who took refuge in the oceans of the World of Two Moons. Thanks to elfin flesh-shaping magic, the Wave-dancers have in some cases undergone physical alterations such as fins and fish-like tails to help them adapt to an aquatic life.

==Longevity==
Most elves are effectively immortal unless killed in battle, or by disease or misadventure. The oldest known elf, Timmain, has lived at least 20,000 years by World of Two Moons&#x27; reckoning (the length of the elves&#x27; presence on the planet), and for countless time before her arrival on that planet. Wolfriders, however, because of their wolf blood, will eventually grow old and die - something that was forgotten during their conflict with humans because of the high mortality rate in that period. It is not known just how long a Wolfrider can live, but some have been known to survive for 3,000-3,500 years. This wolf trait can be removed by a healer, but such a profound excision of an inherent element of themselves is an option few Wolfriders find desirable. So far the only &#x27;reverted&#x27; wolfriders are Skywise, in an act of desperation, and Windkin, who had his wolf blood removed in infancy without consent, and more recently, Moonshade, after a certain time of living in near proximity of the Palace of the High Ones, which altered her perceptions of life. Suntop (later renamed Sunstream), though of Wolfrider descent, never had wolf blood; his twin sister Ember &#x27;called&#x27; the wolf blood to herself in the womb.

After death an elf&#x27;s immortal spirit survives. Most elfin spirits journey to the Palace of the High Ones, but the descendants of Timmorn Yellow-Eyes, due to their wolf blood, can choose to remain to watch over their people. It has been stated that they are the only elves who are able to go where they wish after death, while all others are involuntarily drawn back to their ancestral home.

==Magic==
Many elves have some magic, or psi powers. These include the following abilities, most of which are never given a name within the comic itself. Many of these are rare talents:
* Animal-bonding: The ability to develop an empathic or telepathic connection with an animal. Only Wolfriders are able to bond with wolves, and have a particularly close connection with them thanks to their wolf blood. A similar power exists among other tribes, such as the Gliders, who bond with giant birds. 
** Animal control: Teir&#x27;s skills with animals go considerably further, allowing him to be considered part of any pack of animals.
* Astral projection: The ability to &#x27;go out&#x27; and communicate with other magic-users in a bodiless psychic plane.
** Mind-snare: The ability, possessed by strong astral projectors, to &#x27;trap&#x27; other projectors in the astral plane, preventing their return to their bodies.
* Fire-starting: The ability to start and control fires. This ability is very rare; among the Wolfriders, the last known possessor who was able to control this magic was Zarhan Fastfire, in the time of the Wolfriders&#x27; second chief. It may have been a failed firestarting attempt by him that created the bad magic pool that spawned Madcoil. Per the novelizations, both Savah and Winnowill also have this ability, but Winnowill has never been shown using it in the comic itself. Savah has only rarely done so, as when she magically lights the lanterns for the Sun Village&#x27;s annual festival.
* Freezing stare: The ability to paralyze an animal or intelligent being with a stare, a kind of hypnosis. It was introduced by Rayek in the &quot;Original Quest&quot;.
* Force shield: The power to create a magical barrier capable of holding back magical attacks or physical objects. This is most effectively demonstrated by Zhantee of the SunFolk in the Forbidden Grove when he shields Krim and Skot from a falling branch and again when he keeps the Djun&#x27;s tower from crushing the others as they escaped.
* Gliding: The ability to &#x27;fly&#x27; or self-levitate, allowing an elf to glide with the winds or with an initial kick-off. Strong gliders use the power more fully for self propulsion, at high speed and maneuverability. Tyldak of the Gliders had Winnowill reshape his body into a bat-like structure so to be able to truly fly with his own propulsion. Gliding is a very deeply innate ability - the Glider elves of Blue Mountain are shown to glide while unconscious, sleeping, or having sex. The magic-user Rayek doesn&#x27;t actually glide - rather, he uses powerful telekinesis to move himself, somewhat lacking in finesse.
* Healing: The ability to heal injury or disease. Unscrupulous healers can invert the power by violently stimulating pain nerves to make the target experience agonizing pain. Conversely, the pleasure nerves can also be stimulated with equal strength, producing intensely pleasurable sensations that can dramatically enhance sexual experiences. Healers can also induce Recognition, with varying degrees of success. Go-backs stigmatize healers, believing they make warriors soft and careless. It is possible for an elf to heal a non-elf (such as a human) but this is significantly more difficult as their bodies are much less malleable.
** Flesh-shaping: The ability, possessed by sophisticated healers, to manipulate flesh to shape it to their desires. This can be done on a large scale, such as Winnowill&#x27;s reshaping of Tyldak into a birdlike being, or on a very subtle level, such as the removal of &#x27;wolf blood&#x27; from Wolfriders.
** Shielding: The ability to protect another from magical attack using one&#x27;s own healing power.
* Levitation: The ability to telekinetically manipulate objects.
* Magic feeling: The ability to detect past and present use of other psi powers.
* Rock-shaping: The ability to sculpt and mold solid rock, but generally this power cannot affect refined metal. This ability is most notably used by the Gliders Egg and Door, as well as firstborn to the High Ones Ekuar.
* Sending: The ability to exchange thoughts and feelings by telepathy. All elves appear to have the capacity for sending, but some tribes use it more often than others; the Wolfriders send frequently, whereas the Go-Backs send very rarely and the Sun Folk hardly at all. Wolfriders can send to their wolves (only the original wolves and their offspring, due to being descendants of Timmorn Yellow-Eyes) but the wolves communicate in images more than words.
** Black-sending: The ability to send in such a way as to cause psychic pain. Winnowill is adept at black-sending. This attack can be blocked by a healer in physical contact with a victim to counter the induced pain.
** Power sending: Strongbow&#x27;s sending is significantly stronger than most, allowing him to reach large distances, or impose his will over weaker minds.
** Send-shielding: The ability to block or protect against the sendings of others. Venka displayed this power at a very young age.
* Shapeshifting: The ability to assume the form of other living creatures (even humans in some cases). Experienced healers can flesh-shape themselves to (for instance) grow gills, but the process is notoriously slower.
* Tree-shaping: The ability to grow and shape plants. Especially skilled is the wolfrider Redlance.

There are also certain abilities that the elves attribute to their family bonds:
* Cutter, Leetah, and the twins (Suntop and Ember) have shown increased strength (in resisting Winnowill&#x27;s attacks, and using sending to overpower her) through being together and acting as a unit (in &quot;Siege at Blue Mountain&quot;). They attributed this specifically to their being a family.
* The twins have a connection that defies any distance, and they attribute it specifically to their being twins. In what appears to be sending but might have an astral projection component, they can communicate even when on opposite sides of the planet, and Suntop has sensed Ember&#x27;s emotional turmoil without any physical communication attempt on her part.

Furthermore, the knowledge of an elf&#x27;s soulname gives the person who knows said soulname power over that elf, in a notably similar manner as True Names in Ursula K. Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;Earthsea&quot; series. While the Wolfriders were at Blue Mountain, Winnowill was able to prevent Dewshine from leaving the mountain by using her soulname as a form of mind control. She had discovered it by spying on Tyldak, who had recently Recognized Dewshine.

The soulname is known from conception to the child&#x27;s parents, and it is forgotten by all involved at birth, later revealed only to the child in a spirit quest. It is often only revealed in Recognition to the Recognized lifemate, unless the elf decides to divulge the name willingly to another, but this is rarely done; two notable occurrences are Dewshine, Tyleet and Scouter, and Nightfall and Redlance, before the fight for the palace with the Go-Backs. Generally, only Wolfriders had soulnames: according to Leetah in the first album, the Sun Folk have either forgotten how to send or do so rarely, which eliminates the need to protect the inner self with a secret name. Gliders, on the other hand, are capable senders and have no soulnames either, and Go-Backs have no soulnames as well, with Kahvi being a possible exception.

===New Moon===
New Moon is Cutter&#x27;s curved sword, passed down to him by his father Bearclaw when he died and Cutter became chief of the Wolfriders. Forged from steel (called &quot;bright-metal&quot; by elves, whose metalwork knowledge is limited), its hilt comes apart to reveal a hidden key. The key&#x27;s purpose, and what it unlocks, are pivotal to the outcome of the original series of &quot;Elfquest&quot;.

===Palace of the High Ones===
There is a familial spirit that exudes this place. Originally it was a cosmic egg, space craft that transmogrified into a Castle, a form that the human inhabitants could identify with. In the beginning of the saga, this is the hidden object of Cutter&#x27;s quest, but in later series, the united elves can join in a united &quot;sending&quot; to lift the Palace and transport themselves throughout the cosmos.

===Egg===
Egg is &quot;the pride of the Gliders&quot;, and refers both to the elf permanently fixed in a stone chair in Blue Mountain, entranced in the levitation and constantly reshaped egg (actually several eggs one inside the other). It is at once an elaborate work of art and history of the elves. Winnowill&#x27;s uniquely long meditations upon the Egg (she was patient enough to watch it shaped from the first shell) allow her to conceive a plan which is the subject of the second series of &quot;Elfquest&quot;, &quot;Siege at Blue Mountain&quot;. Egg (the rock shaper, real name Aurek) is later called Father of Memory by Jink.

==Sex and relationships==
===Fertility===
Because of their extreme longevity, elves have a very low birth rate. Stable and peaceful elf societies such as the Sun Folk and the Gliders have no deaths for long periods and therefore no births, while the Wolfriders and Go-Backs, plagued by centuries of war against humans and trolls respectively, have a higher birth rate in order to stabilize their populations, although still very low by human standards.

Elves also have a very long gestation period - about two years. The reason for this is not entirely clear, but it does make the eventual birth of a child an eagerly-anticipated event. Among elves the concept of an unwanted child is unthinkable.

Perhaps because of the low birth rate, and the fact that elves have no sexually transmitted diseases, sex is regarded also as a recreational rather than a reproductive activity and there are few taboos.

===Relationships: Lovemates and lifemates===
Elves who form casual relationships with partners of either sex are called &quot;lovemates&quot;, and it is fairly common for an elf to have more than one lovemate at a time. Although this is not like marriage, lovemates can be very close, and the loss of a lovemate can be traumatic.

Some elves choose partners, usually of the opposite sex, for life, called &quot;lifemates&quot;. This is the closest elfin equivalent to marriage, but there is no bar against one or both lifemates of a pair taking other lovemates (or even other lifemates) of either sex, as long as the other does not object. While lifemates usually share soul names, lovemates usually do not.

While elves tend to remain emotionally loyal to their lifemates, they can be free with their sexuality.

These arrangements usually run smoothly, although possessiveness and jealousy are not unknown. Freedom and independence within a relationship were key concerns for Leetah, as she struggled over whether to form a relationship with Cutter; Savah made her realize that the Wolfriders value freedom too, so Cutter was not likely to be a controlling mate. True to Savah&#x27;s word, the couple&#x27;s submission to the demands of Recognition eventually were replaced with a deep mutual love, to the point Leetah later told Rayek &quot;He [Cutter] was my SOUL!&quot;

===Recognition===
Among the elves there is the phenomenon known as &quot;Recognition&quot;. When two elves of opposite sex having exceptionally compatible qualities for reproduction meet they experience a sudden and immediate compulsion to mate. This leads to a child and often becoming life-mates. A Wolfrider who experiences Recognition involuntarily surrenders his or her soul name to the other recognized elf. This is described by the phrase, &quot;soul meets soul when eyes meet eyes&quot;.

Recognition is a purely involuntary urge that has no regard for pre-existing relationships. This can cause considerable tension between one or both of those experiencing it and their established partners; while Recognition does not dictate the formation of a lasting relationship, it is very common. This is likely due to the two elves involved knowing the other&#x27;s soulname, removing all barriers to essentially knowing everything about the person. Generally, even if a longer relationship does not develop, a new-found level of respect is formed. Some elves have tried to resist Recognition, but this only causes them to experience increasing physical and mental distress. Richard Pini has stated that unconsummated Recognition is never fatal.

Emotional reactions to Recognition have varied widely with different characters. For instance, Leetah&#x27;s parents were close for some time before they Recognized, and they immediately complied with the biological imperative without any argument. By contrast, Leetah attempted to resist her Recognition with Cutter, but the combination of Cutter&#x27;s patience with her reticence, her growing appreciation for Wolfrider culture, and her elder&#x27;s counsel on the matter convinced her to cooperate, until Recognition faded favor of a strong love. On the other hand, Dewshine and Tyldak of the Gliders were mutually resistant until they were convinced to fulfill the physical requirements before agreeing to go their separate ways. When Dewshine&#x27;s lifemate, Scouter, recognized Tyleet, Dewshine was delighted at this development, and in turn they formed a triad.

The purpose of Recognition is to produce healthy offspring that have their beneficial inherited characteristics maximized. Whatever emotional upheavals it may cause, all elves agree that children conceived in Recognition have greater physical, mental and magical gifts than those who are not. For example, the children of the recognized lifemates, Cutter and Leetah, Suntop and Ember have considerable magical potential and physical hardiness respectively. A gifted offspring resulting from non-Recognized parents do occur; one example is Kahvi and Rayek&#x27;s magically endowed daughter Venka.

Recognition can have direct consequences for the affected adults. For instance, Dewshine and Tyldak&#x27;s perception of each other is directly influenced by the effect; Dewshine sees Tyldak in his normal form before Winnowil altered his body into a bird-like structure while Tyldak sees her as a half-animal with fur and a vaguely lupine face. Another example is the Recognized union of Woodlock and Rainsong, notably prolific as far as elves go.

Probably the strangest noted &quot;Recognition&quot;, confirmed by Wendy and Richard Pini from &quot;Wolfrider! The Newer edition&quot; is between Skywise and Cutter. After a daunting year of Cutter being forced to be the trolls&#x27; slave, Skywise bought his freedom, causing great anger to Cutter (who wanted to gain the trolls&#x27; respect), and the tension thus caused the two of them to discover the other&#x27;s soulname whilst fighting. The two have determined they are &quot;brothers in all but blood&quot; since then, even experiencing the other&#x27;s pain in times of duress.

===The Go-Backs&#x27; Orgy===
Among the Go-backs one further form of sexual relationship exists: the orgy. In Go-back society both sexes fight in wars. Thus the night before a battle is usually marked by frenzied dancing followed by group sexual activity. This is partly in order to celebrate life before risking it in battle, and partly to scatter seed as widely as possible so that those females who survive will replenish the tribe. In addition, the founder of this tribe favored quantity over quality in reproduction and thus Recognition&#x27;s influence was significantly reduced to allow for more frequent conceptions.

<text>Patent infringement is an unauthorized act of - for example - making, using, offering for sale, selling, or importing for these purposes a patented product. Where the subject-matter of the patent is a process, infringement involves the act of using, offering for sale, selling or importing for these purposes at least the product obtained by the patented process. In other words, patent infringement is the commission of a prohibited act with respect to a patented invention without permission from the patent holder. Permission may typically be granted in the form of a license. The definition of patent infringement may vary by jurisdiction.

The scope of the patented invention or the extent of protection is defined in the claims of the granted patent. In other words, the terms of the claims inform the public of what is not allowed without the permission of the patent holder.

Patents are territorial, and infringement is only possible in a country where a patent is in force. For example, if a patent is granted in the United States, then anyone in the United States is prohibited from making, using, selling or importing the patented item, while people in other countries may be free to exploit the patented invention in their country. The scope of protection may vary from country to country, because the patent is examined – or in some countries not substantively examined – by the patent office in each country or region and may be subject to different patentability requirements.

== Overview ==
Typically, a party (other than the patentee or licensee of the patentee) that manufactures, imports, uses, sells, or offers for sale patented technology without permission/license from the patentee, during the term of the patent and within the country that issued the patent, is considered to infringe the patent.

To determine if a patent has been infringed, a specific test is used. The test varies from country to country, but in general it requires that the infringing party&#x27;s product (or method, service, and so on) falls within one or more of the (independent) claims of the patent. The process employed involves &quot;reading&quot; a claim onto the technology of interest. If all of the claim&#x27;s elements are found in the technology, the claim is said to &quot;read on&quot; the technology; if a single element from the claim is missing from the technology, the claim does not literally read on the technology and the technology generally does not infringe the patent with respect to that claim, except if the doctrine of equivalents is considered applicable.

In response to allegations of infringement, an accused infringing party typically asserts one or more of the following:

* that it was not practicing the patented invention, i.e. the invention claimed in the patent (the claims define the extent of protection conferred by a patent);
* that it was not performing any infringing act in the territory covered by the patent (patents are indeed territorial in nature);
* that the patent has expired (since patents have a limited patent term, i.e. a limited lifetime);
* that the patent (or the particular claim(s) alleged to be infringed) is invalid, because the invention in question does not meet the patentability requirements or includes a formal defect, this rendering the patent invalid or unenforceable;
* that it has obtained a license under the patent.

The parties may also resolve their dispute in a settlement, which may involve a licensing agreement, such as a cross-licensing agreement. Private settlements may not always serve the public interest, &quot;because litigating patent disputes to completion tends to generate positive externalities, by clarifying the limits of patent protection if the patent is upheld or encouraging wider use of the innovation if the patent is invalidated&quot;.

=== Indirect infringement ===
In certain jurisdictions, there is a particular case of patent infringement called &quot;indirect infringement.&quot; Indirect infringement can occur, for instance, when a device is claimed in a patent and a third party supplies a product which can only be reasonably used to make the claimed device.

==Clearance searches and opinions ==

A clearance search, also called freedom-to-operate (FTO) search or infringement search, is a search done on issued patents or on pending patent applications to determine if a product or process infringes any of the claims of the issued patents or pending patent applications. A clearance search may also include expired art that acts as a &#x27;safe harbor&#x27; permitting the product or process to be used based on patents in the public domain. These searches are often performed by one or more professional patent searchers who are under the direction of one or more patent attorneys.

Clearance searches may also be performed on a regular basis (e.g., monthly) if an individual is concerned about patenting activity in a particular industry or with respect to a particular product.

A clearance search can be followed by a &quot;clearance opinion&quot;, i.e. a legal opinion provided by one or more patent attorneys as to whether a given product or process infringes the claims of one or more issued patents or pending patent applications. Clearance opinions may be done in combination with a &quot;validity and enforceability&quot; opinion. A validity and enforceability opinion is a legal opinion as to whether a given patent is valid and/or enforceable. In other words, a &quot;validity opinion&quot; is a legal opinion or letter in which a patent attorney or patent agent analyzes an issued patent and provides an opinion on how a court might rule on its validity or enforceability. Validity opinions are often sought before litigation related to a patent. The average cost of a validity opinion (according to one 2007 survey) is over $15,000, with an infringement analysis adding $13,000.

The cost of these opinions for U.S. patents can run from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars (or more) depending upon the particular patent, the number of defenses and prior art references, the length of the prosecution file history, and the complexity of the technology in question.

An &quot;exculpatory opinion&quot; (setting forth reasons the patent is not infringed, or providing other defenses such as prior use, intervening rights, or prior invention) is also possible.

== Patent infringement insurance ==

Patent infringement insurance is an insurance policy provided by one or more insurance companies to protect either an inventor or a third party from the risks of inadvertently infringing a patent.

In June 2006, a Study for the European Commission on the feasibility of possible insurance schemes against patent litigation risks was published. The report concluded that the continuation of the status quo with very little, disproportionately expensive, bespoke patent litigation insurance (PLI) would not meet any objectives for a feasible insurance scheme. Instead, only a mandatory scheme was considered to be viable in order to provide the economic and technical benefits to the EU and individual patentees which would arise from a widespread PLI scheme.

== Legislation ==
=== Australia ===
In Australia, a patent infringement occurs when a person, who is not the patentee, exploits or authorises another person to exploit the patent in question.

&#x27;Exploit&#x27; in this context includes:

*(i) Make, hire, sell or otherwise dispose of a patented product; or 
*(ii) Offer to make, sell, hire or otherwise dispose of a patented product; or
*(iii) Use or import a patented product; or
*(iv) Keep it for the purposes of doing (i), (ii) or (iii); or
*(v) Use a patented method or process; or
*(vi) Do any act mentioned from (i) to (iv) above in respect of a product resulting from the use of a patented method or process.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, patents are governed by the Patent Act, and the rights of a patent holder are summarized at s. 42:

By granting the patent holder the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of making, constructing, using, and selling the invention, the Act establishes that any other person making, constructing, using, or selling the patented invention is infringing that patent. Whether there has been an infringement of a patent is usually a question of fact.

Canada is considered to be more friendly for rights holders in pursuing patent claims than in the United States, due to significant differences between the two jurisdictions:

:* Patents in Canada are subject to a purposive construction, which relies on reading both the claims and the specifications to determine the scope of a patent, and extrinsic evidence is not permitted, leading to the absence of prosecution history estoppel.
:* While US patent trials are heard by a jury, Canadian trials are heard by a judge only, and thus the claims of a Canadian patent are construed only once as part of the trial judge&#x27;s decision on the merits of the case as a whole. In that regard, the Federal Court of Appeal has ruled that Markman hearings are not allowed under Canadian law.
:* In Canada, the applicant has no obligation to disclose material prior art, so patents cannot be invalidated on that basis.
:* The same absence of obligation also means that the &quot;Competition Act&quot; will not come into play, unlike what occurs with antitrust law in the US.
:* The Canadian discovery process is more streamlined than the US procedure, resulting in less cost and time in pursuing the lawsuit, and it also possesses an implied undertaking rule, barring use of information produced or disclosed in discovery from any purpose other than the present litigation (other than by leave of the court).
:* Canadian law allows a plaintiff to elect to claim either compensatory damages or an accounting of profits, which can either act as a deterrent on infringement or as an incentive to reach a settlement before trial.
:* The availability of costs in Canadian courts is a significant advantage to a plaintiff confident of success, but is also a deterrent to pursuing more speculative cases.
:* Treble damages are not awarded in Canadian courts, and punitive damages are less likely to be awarded.

=== Europe ===

In Europe, national courts are competent for adjudicating patent infringement of national patents, national parts of European patents and Eurasian patents when the infringement takes place on their territory. Jurisdiction is determined for the countries in the European Economic Area by the Brussels regime, which means that for those countries also the court of the residence of the infringer is competent. 

For the 17 countries participating in the Unified Patent Court (UPC), that court is competent for European patents in the same way as the national courts are, unless they are opted out. The UPC is furthermore competent for hearing cases regarding infringement of unitary patents, alongside the EEA courts of non-UPC countries (eg Spain, Norway) if the defendant has his residence/place of business there.

=== India ===

The Indian Patents Act 1970 does not specifically define activities that constitute infringement of patents. However, the following acts are deemed to be infringements according to the Patent Act:

:* Mechanical equivalents; 
:* Carrying essential features of the invention; 
:* Immaterial variation in the invention; and 
:* The colorable imitation of the invention. 

=== Japan ===
Infringement under the patent law in Japan is defined by Article 68 and Article 101 of Patent Act (Act No. 121 of 1959). Article 68 sets out the following types of infringement:
* Where the invention is a product, by making, using, assigning, etc., importing, exporting or offering for assignment, etc. of the product as a business.
* Where the invention is a process, by using as a business. 
* Where the invention is a process to obtain a product, by making, using, assigning, etc., importing, exporting or offering for assignment, etc. of the product as a business.

Article 101 shows the following acts shall be deemed to constitute infringement of a patent right or an exclusive license:
* (i) where a patent has been granted for an invention of a product, acts of producing, assigning, etc., importing or offering for assignment, etc. any product to be used exclusively for the producing of the said product as a business;
* (ii) where a patent has been granted for an invention of a product, acts of producing, assigning, etc., importing or offering for assignment, etc. any product (excluding those widely distributed within Japan) to be used for the producing of the said product and indispensable for the resolution of the problem by the said invention as a business, knowing that the said invention is a patented invention and the said product is used for the working of the invention;
* (iii) where a patent has been granted for an invention of a process, acts of producing, assigning, etc., importing or offering for assignment, etc. any product to be used exclusively for the use of the said process as a business; and
* (iv) where a patent has been granted for an invention of a process, acts of producing, assigning, etc., importing or offering for assignment, etc. any product (excluding those widely distributed within Japan) to be used for the use of the said process and indispensable for the resolution of the problem by the said invention, knowing that the said invention is a patented invention and the said product is used for the working of the invention as a business.

=== United Kingdom ===

Infringement under United Kingdom patent law is defined by Section 60 of the UK Patents Act 1977 (as amended), which sets out the following types of infringement:

* Where the invention is a product, by the making, disposing of, offering to dispose of, using, importing or keeping a patented product.
* Where the invention is a process, by the use, or offer for use where it is known that the use of the process would be an infringement. Also, by the disposal of, offer to dispose of, use or import of a product obtained directly by means of that process, or the keeping of any such product whether for disposal or otherwise.
* By the supply, or offer to supply, in the United Kingdom, a person not entitled to work the invention, with any of the means, relating to an essential element of the invention, for putting the invention into effect, when it is known (or it is reasonable to expect such knowledge) that those means are suitable for putting, and are intended to put, the invention into effect in the United Kingdom.

=== United States ===

In United States law, an infringement may occur where the defendant has made, used, sold, offered to sell, or imported an infringing invention or its equivalent. One also commits indirect infringement if he actively and knowingly induces another to infringe, and is liable for that infringement. Types of &quot;indirect infringement&quot; include &quot;contributory infringement&quot; and &quot;induced infringement.&quot;

No infringement action may be started until the patent is issued. However, pre-grant protection is available under (d), which allows a patent owner to obtain reasonable royalty damages for certain infringing activities that occurred before patent&#x27;s date of issuance. This right to obtain provisional damages requires a patent holder to show that (1) the infringing activities occurred after the publication of the patent application, (2) the patented claims are substantially identical to the claims in the published application, and (3) the infringer had &quot;actual notice&quot; of the published patent application.

Patent infringement cases are decided exclusively by Federal, rather than by State, courts. A court can impose one or more of the following remedies:

* an injunction, i.e. an order to stop an infringing act. If an injunction order is not followed, the infringer can be criminally charged with contempt of court. Preliminary injunction can be imposed before trial in order to end the infringing activity immediately. However, since 2006 an injunction is available only under limited circumstances, as prescribed by the SCOTUS in &quot;eBay v. MercExchange&quot;. According to this ruling, in order to have a preliminary injunction issued by a judge, the plaintiff must show 
# that it has suffered irreparable injury (note: &quot;has suffered&quot; not &quot;will suffer&quot;), 
# that remedies at law (e.g., monetary damages) are inadequate,
# that a balancing of hardships favors a grant of injunction, and 
# that the public interest would &quot;not be disserved&quot; by the grant of a preliminary injunction.

The Court issued this decision in order to reduce the impact of patent lawsuits initiated by non-practicing entities, such as patent trolls or universities acting like patent trolls. 

* reasonable royalty remedy is available in most patent infringement cases. Since 1971, this remedy is controlled by Federal Circuit precedent in Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. United States Plywood Corp.

In the US there are safe harbor provisions to use a patented invention for the purposes of gathering data for a regulatory submission.

== &quot;Piracy&quot; ==
Since the 1840s, the expression &quot;patent pirate&quot; has been used as a pejorative term to describe those that infringe a patent and refuse to acknowledge the priority of the inventor. Samuel F. B. Morse, inventor of the telegraph, for example, complained in a letter to friend in 1848

The term &quot;pirate&quot; has also been used to describe patent owners that vigorously enforce their patents. Thus whether one deliberately infringes a patent or whether one vigorously enforces a patent, they may be referred to as a pirate by those that feel they are overstepping their bounds.

==Threat to bring a patent infringement action==
&quot;A threat to bring a patent infringement action is highly likely to influence the commercial conduct of the person threatened, which is why the law of some countries, including the UK, provides that the making of a groundless threat to sue is, within certain carefully prescribed limits, an actionable wrong in itself.&quot; This however is not the case in the United States.

<doc id="615718" wikidata="Q1982103" url="?curid=615718" title="Post-medieval archaeology">
<text>Post-medieval archaeology is a term used in Europe to describe the study of the material past over the last 500 years. The field is also referred to as historical archaeology, a term originating in North America, and common in countries impacted by European colonialism. It is closely related to industrial archaeology and contemporary archaeology. Many scholars have found a connection between post-medieval and contemporary archaeology particularly in how scholars can view their archaeological study and apply in their own present contexts. It is also crucial by studying both post-medieval and contemporary archaeology that it can benefit the future of archaeology, particularly as scholars can apply the studies in more recent periods as time progresses.

Initially post-medieval archaeology did not extend its studies past the mid 18th century, though as a result of subsequent critiques within the field this cut-off date has been discarded, and the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology, Europe&#x27;s leading professional society for the period, now explicitly considers its remit to be &quot;the archaeology of the post-medieval world up to the present day and beyond&quot;.

The emergence of post-medieval archaeology began in the second half of the 20th century by exploring primarily European cultures such as Germany, France, The Mediterranean, and Scandinavia. This was done after World War II, where archaeology was primarily focused on richer countries in Europe such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Ever since then, there has been an emergence in studying post-medieval archaeology which has expanded along with the expansion of access to education and differing educational studies. This emergence of archaeology has also expanded the field of archaeological study and has allowed further study in the field of archaeology.

The traditional date for the beginning of the post-medieval period in Britain has been 1485 when, following the Battle of Bosworth, the Tudor dynasty took the throne. In practice, the medieval period is now often extended into the reign of the Tudor monarchs and the boundary between the two eras is not precise. As with all attempts to neatly periodise the archaeological record, efforts to impose an exact date on the transition are doomed to be questioned by current and new findings. As there is the urge to learn more about post-medieval archaeology in Europe, there is an additional urge to explore post-medieval archaeology in the wider world. Archaeologists and historians are hoping to expand the study of post-medieval archaeology to help better learn about the way of life after the medieval period.

Given the relatively strong historical record running alongside the archaeological one, post-medieval archaeology is often strongly positioned to study the effects of known social and political change. The immediacy of the period means that it appeals in fields such as genealogy as well as to students of social history.

Post-medieval sites include Nonsuch Palace in Surrey, the Rose Theatre in London and Fort Amherst in Chatham.

== History ==

The emergence of post-medieval archaeology was first recognised in the 1970s in Europe. Before there had been no specific studies associated with this archaeological term. Considering prior to World War II, the use of archaeology wasn’t presented to examine the history and artefacts of Europe. This emergence of the term post-medieval archaeology was crucial in revealing parts of Europe which hadn’t gained full recognition and by further expanding the story of these European countries. It was also crucial in expanding further knowledge of Europe, which would benefit for tourism opportunities. For present day, the exploration of post-medieval archaeology continues to be explored. There is an expansion in the way that archaeologists take part in the different practices of archaeology and how the study of archaeology is accessed. For the future, the study of post-medieval archaeology is an ongoing practice which archaeologists are striving to uncover and connect with differing archaeological studies. During the beginnings of the study of post-medieval archaeology, there has been an issue regarding how to define the subject, and even had become a term which had been isolated in certain European settings. This is due to how the study of post-medieval archaeology can be viewed as an umbrella term in how it covers various periods of history. However, it is important to recognise the subject matter in a study of post-medieval archaeology and question how post-medieval archaeology can be displayed in a general term. Throughout the study of post-medieval archaeology, it is argued that it can be practised without written sources, that it primarily functions on the physical grand artefacts. Just like the study of history, post-medieval archaeology can benefit from the use of written sources.  Additionally, the study of post-medieval archaeology goes beyond merely studying artefacts. It benefits to study the role of religion and other aspects which benefit archaeologists in gaining a better understanding of way of living. In a book titled ‘The Archaeology of Post-medieval Religion’, it strives to understand post-medieval religion, which can benefit study into other factors of post-medieval life such as the role of gender and other cultural aspects. A majority of research articles about this study of archaeology can be credited to the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology. Another aspect of post-medieval archaeology finds that there is a focus on a fresh perspective in archaeological approaches. This is due to how discussions surrounding contemporary archaeological matters influence a better appreciation for the past and thus influencing archaeological research.

== The Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology ==
The Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology is an ongoing leading society regarding the study of historical archaeology in the post-medieval period. It is a society which was stemmed from the Post-Medieval Ceramic Research Group, which was established in the 1960s. With this establishment, there was a gradual increase in their influence, however in the beginning they experienced financial difficulties in relation to printing research papers and articles. The 1970s saw a period of inflation which hugely affected the production of research. The initial focus for this society was on British archaeology, yet there is a desire to explore further archaeology in Europe through the post-medieval period. In present day, the expansion of this society has grown to include the study of post-medieval archaeology outside of Europe. The society produces a journal titled ‘Post-Medieval Archaeology’, which archives all types of post-medieval archaeology from around the world. There have been additional discussions in the present day about the reputation and the way that the society strives to engage with this study of archaeology. This links to the recent discussions about the society including archaeology which leads up to the present day. The Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology’s response shows that it is inclusive of all archaeological studies in striving to promote their enthusiasm for the study of archaeology.

== Contribution to Contemporary Archaeology ==
Through the continued research of post-medieval archaeology, many academics including those in the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology, have found a connection between the post-medieval and contemporary archaeology. As the discovery of post-medieval archaeology has emerged, there is a link with contemporary archaeology as it encourages archaeologists to look at their current lives and the way they engage with archaeological study. Additionally, the rise in contemporary archaeology allowed for archaeologists and people studying to be able to examine their own way of living in the present moment. The term contemporary archaeology is a term which doesn’t display clarity in what period of archaeology it examines. According to the Post-Medieval Archaeology journal, it examines that the role of ‘contemporary’ is lacking, in the way that there is conflict regarding the way that the term contemporary is interpreted in archaeology. Through the initial research of this debate of what to label as contemporary, academics and archaeologists rely on public research and social support for mainstream archaeological aide. Contemporary archaeology links with post-medieval archaeology as it is rooted on the future of studying archaeology. Through various studies which archaeologists have done, many of them including Hilary Orange who conducted research on artificial light in relation to her studies finds the relationship between the methods of post-medieval and contemporary archaeology. Ultimately, both of these studies of archaeology are being examined for future use, which intrigues many archaeologists and those in the Society for Post-Medieval Archaeology. Additionally, there are certain areas of study in archaeology which can draw a connection between post-medieval and contemporary. One of these is the study of battle and conflict. These areas of study blend the two areas of archaeology together as well as providing further study conducted by academics and archaeologists. Contemporary archaeology is crucial through the study of urban archaeology, as it furthers understanding regarding material dynamics in past living conditions. This information can thus be related to our own way of living and further enhance the continued study of archaeology.

== Post-Medieval Archaeology in different cultures ==

The study of post-medieval archaeology was initially used to examine European cultures following the medieval period. Whilst post-medieval archaeology has a strong presence in learning about archaeology in Europe, there is an urge to delve deeper in learning about archaeology in other parts of the world.

===Germany===

The post-medieval archaeology of Germany can be linked to the study of World War II in Nazi Germany, as it is a subject with ongoing study and inquiry. The study of post-medieval archaeology can be used to examine the archaeology of Nazi Germany in relation to the populations and human activity of the Nazi region during the period before and during World War II. Additionally, the study of post-medieval archaeology has brought about a new finding for artefacts which came from the post-medieval period. Aspects such as Christian burials were considered important artefacts in this period, even though it came with its own complications, it produced research for burial grounds in Germany.
===Italy===
The post-medieval archaeology of Italy was first researched in the 1960s and 1970s to investigate archaeological evidence. Eventually there was a growing pursuit to study not only post-medieval archaeology but also rural archaeology specifically in urban parts of Italy. Through post-medieval archaeology, archaeologists found many artefacts which can be classified in this period of study. In addition, there was an environmental focus for post-medieval archaeology which has influenced the ways of studying the land management during this period.

===France===

The post-medieval archaeology of France is extensive in relation to France’s vast history. Like the general pursuit of archaeology, the study of post-medieval archaeology in France commenced in the late 1960s. French post-medieval archaeology can extend up to World War II, with campaigns including the 1944 Normandy Campaign, in which archaeologists’ study both the battlefield and its artefacts but also the urbanisation of that period. Furthermore, the use of post-medieval archaeology in France can be expanded based on colonialism. There are French archaeology sites that extend beyond France, such as the Saint-Louis forts and chateaux site in Canada which allows archaeologists to examine French expansion and what is referred to as the “new France”. Through the study of post-medieval archaeology in France, it can be linked to Canadian archaeology through France’s expansion in Canada. A great number of archaeology studies were undertaken in these archaeological sites such as the Fortress of Louisburg and other urban estates in Canada after France claimed territory. With this information, it expands the knowledge of post-medieval archaeology and drifts it away from being mainly focused on Europe and more expansive in the wider world.

===Portugal===

The beginnings of studying post-medieval archaeology in Portugal began in the 1980s and yet it was a while before it was recognised as an academic field of archaeological study. The post-medieval archaeology of Portugal is predominantly focused on the periods between the 16th and 18th century. It is additionally notable for its distinct artefacts which have been found which many appear to be imported from places outside of Portugal. A big factor concerning post-medieval archaeology of Portugal was through the Carnation Revolution in which Portuguese people became more intrigued by their culture and urban archaeology. Following this, there were certain laws which allowed archaeological study as well as construction work, which displayed a lacking in the study as many archaeologists didn’t appear to have a background in medieval or post-medieval history. Notable factors of post-medieval archaeology in Portugal include the many sites in Lisbon. This includes the remains of buildings that were due to the 1775 Lisbon earthquake. Post-medieval archaeology of Portugal also extends beyond Portugal itself. The discovery of Portuguese pottery was examined in Southampton, England. This artefact of Merida-type ware was presented in an assemblage in Southampton. Whilst there is no accurate dating, it is believed that these importations to England began in the 13th century and expanded through the post-medieval period.

<doc id="615732" wikidata="Q1637292" url="?curid=615732" title="Three-strikes law">
<text>In the United States, habitual offender laws (commonly referred to as three-strikes laws) have been implemented since at least 1952, and are part of the United States Justice Department&#x27;s Anti-Violence Strategy. These laws require a person who is convicted of an offense and who has one or two other previous serious convictions to serve a mandatory life sentence in prison, with or without parole depending on the jurisdiction. The purpose of the laws is to drastically increase the punishment of those who continue to commit offenses after being convicted of one or two serious crimes.

Twenty-eight states have some form of a &quot;three-strikes&quot; law. A person accused under such laws is referred to in a few states (notably Connecticut and Kansas) as a &quot;persistent offender&quot;, while Missouri uses the unique term &quot;prior and persistent offender&quot;. In most jurisdictions, only crimes at the felony level qualify as serious offenses, with some jurisdictions further restricting qualifying offenses to only include violent felonies.

The three-strikes law significantly increases the prison sentences of persons convicted of a felony who have been previously convicted of two or more violent crimes or serious felonies, and limits the ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life sentence.

The expression &quot;Three strikes and you are out&quot; is derived from baseball, where a batter has three chances to either hit a pitched ball or earn an error called a &quot;strike.&quot; After three &quot;strikes&quot; the batter strikes out and their chance to score is over.

==History==
The practice of imposing longer prison sentences on repeat offenders (versus first-time offenders who commit the same crime) is present throughout most of American history, as judges often take into consideration prior offenses when sentencing. However, there is a more recent history of mandatory prison sentences for repeat offenders. For example, New York State had a long-standing &quot;Persistent Felony Offender&quot; law dating back to the early 20th century (partially ruled unconstitutional in 2010, but reaffirmed &quot;en banc&quot; shortly after). But such sentences were not compulsory in each case, and judges had much more discretion as to what term of incarceration should be imposed.

During Prohibition the state of Michigan enacted one of the harshest laws against bootlegging in the nation. The law required a life sentence for those violating liquor laws for the fourth time. In late 1928 Etta Mae Miller, a mother of four was found guilty under this law, sparking outrage.

The first true &quot;three-strikes&quot; law was passed in 1993, when Washington voters approved Initiative 593. California passed its own in 1994, when their voters passed Proposition 184 by an overwhelming majority, with 72% in favor and 28% against. The initiative proposed to the voters had the title of &quot;Three Strikes and You&#x27;re Out&quot;, referring to &quot;de facto&quot; life imprisonment after being convicted of three violent or serious felonies which are listed under California Penal Code section 1192.7.

The concept swiftly spread to other states, but none of them chose to adopt a law as sweeping as California&#x27;s. By 2004, twenty-six states and the federal government had laws that satisfy the general criteria for designation as &quot;three-strikes&quot; statutes—namely, that a third felony conviction brings a sentence of 20 to life where 20 years must be served before becoming parole eligible.

Three-strikes laws have been cited as an example of the McDonaldization of punishment, in which the focus of criminological and penological interest has shifted away from retribution and treatment tailored to the individual offender and toward the control of high-risk groups based on aggregations and statistical averages. A three-strikes system achieves uniformity in punishment of criminals in a certain class (viz., three-time offenders) in a way that is analogous to how a fast food restaurant achieves uniformity of its product.

==Enactment by states==

The following states have enacted three-strikes laws:
*New York has employed a habitual felon statute since 1797.
*North Carolina has had a law dealing with habitual felons since 1967, but the law was amended in 1994 and now means that a third conviction for any violent felony (which includes any Class A, B, C, D or E Felony) will result in a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole. 
*Maryland has had a habitual felon statute for violent offenders since 1975. The law was amended in 1994, meaning that a fourth conviction for a crime of violence mandates a sentence of life imprisonment without parole. 
*Alabama has had a habitual felon statute for serious and violent felons since 1977, providing for up to life imprisonment, and includes a mandatory life sentence without parole for three or more felony convictions if at least one of these was for an offense classified as a Class A Felony (10–99 years or life). 
*Delaware has had a three-strikes law providing up to life imprisonment for serious felonies since 1973, when the Delaware Criminal Code, contained under Part I, Title 11 of the Delaware Code, became effective. 
*Texas has had a three-strikes with mandatory life sentence since at least 1952.
**In &quot;Rummel v. Estelle&quot; (1980), the US Supreme Court upheld Texas&#x27;s statute, which arose from a case involving a refusal to repay $120.75 paid for air conditioning repair that was, depending on the source cited, either considered unsatisfactory or not performed at all, where the defendant had been convicted of two prior felony convictions, and where the total amount involved from all three felonies was around $230.
*In 1993: Washington
*In 1994: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina, Virginia, Louisiana, Wisconsin, and Tennessee. Tennessee is one of the few states, together with Georgia, Florida, Montana and South Carolina, that mandates life without parole for two or more convictions for the most serious violent crimes, including murder, rape, aggravated cases of robbery, sexual abuse or child sexual abuse, etc. 
**California&#x27;s original Proposition 184 was later modified by 2012 California Proposition 36. In 2003, a sentence under the law was upheld in &quot;Ewing v. California.&quot; 
*In 1995: Arkansas, Florida, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah, Georgia and Vermont. Georgia has a &quot;two strikes&quot; law, also known as the &quot;seven deadly sins&quot; law, which mandates a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for two or more convictions of murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, aggravated sexual battery, aggravated sodomy, or aggravated child molestation or any combination of those offenses. In 1995, Montana also enacted a two strikes law during this period and has since mandated life imprisonment without parole for any person convicted a second time of deliberate homicide, aggravated kidnapping, sexual intercourse without consent, sexual abuse of a child or ritual abuse of a minor. A three strikes law in the state also exists for lesser crimes, such as aggravated assault, mitigated kidnapping and robbery. This means that a third conviction of any such crimes also mandates life without parole.
*In 1996: South Carolina. South Carolina also has a &quot;two strikes&quot; law for crimes known as a &quot;most serious offense&quot;, which are crimes like murder, rape, attempted murder, armed robbery, etc. whereas, the &quot;three strikes&quot; law applies to &quot;serious offenses&quot; which are many drug offenses, other violent crimes like burglary, robbery, arson, etc. and even serious nonviolent crimes like insurance fraud, forgery, counterfeit, etc. Two convictions or three convictions under these provisions or any combination of these will automatically result in a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. The South Carolina &quot;two strikes&quot; law is similar to Georgia&#x27;s seven-deadly-sins law. 
*Florida passed HB 1371, the Prisoner Release Reoffender Act, in May 1997, which in of itself is a &quot;two-strikes&quot; law. The Florida &quot;two strikes law&quot; dictates that individuals convicted of certain categories of crime who reoffend within three years is subject to life in prison without parole, even if this is only a second offense, gaining the distinction of, &quot;one of the strictest sentencing laws in the U.S.&quot;.
*In 2006: Arizona
*In 2012: Massachusetts
*In 2012: Michigan In 2012, Michigan&#x27;s legislature passed Senate Bill 1109, enacting Public Act 319 amending Section 769.12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. More commonly referred to as the three strikes law, the change updated sentencing guidelines to crack down on habitual offenders, specifically habitual felony offenders. This took effect on October 1, 2012. While it is commonly referred to as the three strikes law, that name is misleading. The law actually applies to an individual convicted of a fourth felony. The new law exposes the individual who is convicted of a fourth felony offense to a mandatory minimum prison sentence of at least 25 years. The law also allows for extending the maximum sentence.
Georgia, South Carolina, Montana and Tennessee are the only states in the United States to date that have &quot;two strikes&quot; laws for the most serious violent crimes, such as murder, rape, serious cases of robbery, etc. and they all mandate a sentence of life imprisonment without parole for a conviction of any such crimes a second time around.

==Application==

The exact application of the three-strikes laws varies considerably from state to state, but the laws call for life sentences for at least 25 years on their third strike. In the state of Maryland, any person who receives their fourth strike for any crime of violence will automatically be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.

Most states require one or more of the three felony convictions to be violent crimes in order for the mandatory sentence to be pronounced. Crimes that fall under the category of &quot;violent&quot; include: murder, kidnapping, sexual abuse, rape, aggravated robbery, and aggravated assault.

Some states include additional, lesser offenses that one would not normally see as violent. For example, the list of crimes that count as serious or violent in the state of California is much longer than that of other states, and consists of many lesser offenses that include: firearm violations, burglary, simple robbery, arson, and providing hard drugs to a minor, and drug possession. As another example, Texas does not require any of the three felony convictions to be violent, but specifically excludes certain &quot;state jail felonies&quot; from being counted for enhancement purposes.

One application of a three-strikes law was the Leonardo Andrade case in California in 2009. In this case, Leandro Andrade attempted to rob for $153 in videotapes from two San Bernardino K-Mart stores. He was charged under California&#x27;s three-strikes law because of his criminal history concerning drugs and other burglaries. Because of his past criminal records, he was sentenced to 50 years in prison with no parole after this last burglary of K-Mart. Although this sentencing was disputed by Erwin Chemerinsky, who represented Andrade, as cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled in support for the life sentencing.

In 1995, Sioux City, Iowa native Tommy Lee Farmer, a professional criminal who had served 43 years in prison for murder and armed robbery was the first person in the United States to be convicted under the federal three-strikes law when he was sentenced to life in prison for an attempted robbery at an eastern Iowa convenience store. He was prosecuted by Stephen J. Rapp, a US Attorney appointed by Clinton. The sentencing was considered so significant that President Bill Clinton interrupted a vacation to make a press statement about it.

Another example of the three-strikes law involves Timothy L. Tyler who, in 1992 at age 24, was sentenced to life in prison without parole when his third conviction (a federal offense) triggered the federal three-strikes law, even though his two prior convictions were not considered violent, and neither conviction resulted in any prison time served.

==Effects==
===United States===

Analyzing the effect of the Three-Strikes legislation as a means of deterrence and incapacitation, a 2004 study found that the Three-Strikes Law did not have a very significant effect on deterrence of crime, but also that this ineffectiveness may be due to the diminishing marginal returns associated with having pre-existing repeat offender laws in place.

Another study found that arrest rates in California were up to 20% lower for the group of offenders convicted of two-strike eligible offenses, compared to those convicted of one-strike eligible offenses. The study concluded that the three-strikes policy was deterring recidivists from committing crimes. California has seen a reduction in criminal activity, and &quot;Stolzenberg and D’Alessio found that serious crime in California’s 10 largest cities collectively had dropped 15% during the 3-year post-intervention period&quot;.

A study written by Robert Parker, director of the Presley Center for Crime and Justice Studies at UC Riverside, states that violent crime began falling almost two years before California&#x27;s three-strikes law was enacted in 1994. The study argues that the decrease in crime is linked to lower alcohol consumption and lower rates of unemployment.

A 2007 study from the Vera Institute of Justice in New York examined the effectiveness of incapacitation under all forms of sentencing. The study estimated that if US incarceration rates were increased by 10 percent, the crime rate would decrease by at least 2 percent. However, this action would be extremely costly to implement.

Another study found that three-strikes laws discourage criminals from committing misdemeanors for fear of a life prison sentence. Although this deters crime and contributes to lower crime rates, the laws may possibly push previously convicted criminals to commit more serious offenses. The study&#x27;s author argues that this is so because under such laws, felons realize that they could face a long jail sentence for their next crime regardless of type, and therefore they have little to lose by committing serious crimes rather than minor offenses. Through these findings, the study weighs both the pros and cons for the law.

A 2015 study found that three-strikes laws were associated with a 33% increase in the risk of fatal assaults on law enforcement officers.

===New Zealand===
In 2010, New Zealand enacted a similar three-strikes law called the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act 2010. The bill was sponsored by Police and Corrections Minister Judith Collins from the ruling National Party. It was passed into law by the National and ACT parties but was opposed by the opposition Labour and Green parties, and National&#x27;s support partner, the Māori Party. While the Sentencing and Parole Act was supported by conservative groups such as the Sensible Sentencing Trust, critics attacked the law for promoting penal populism and disproportionately targeting the Māori community.

In early June 2018, an attempt by the Labour-led coalition government to overturn the Sentencing and Parole Act was blocked by Labour&#x27;s support partner New Zealand First and the opposition National and ACT parties. NZ First had indicated its opposition to overturning the three-strikes bill, prompting the Justice Minister, Andrew Little, to abandon the attempt.

On 11 November 2021, the Minister of Justice Kris Faafoi announced that the Government was introducing legislation to repeal the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act. On 9 August 2022, the New Zealand Parliament passed the Three Strikes Legislation Repeal Bill, which repealed the Sentencing and Parole Reform Act. The repeal legislation was supported by the Labour, Green, and Māori parties but was opposed by the National and ACT parties, who moved to reinstate three-strikes legislation in April 2024 after being re-elected in 2023.

On 13 December 2024, the New Zealand Parliament passed legislation reinstating a three-strikes sentencing regime in New Zealand. The law was supported by the National, ACT and New Zealand First parties but was opposed by the opposition Labour, Green parties and Te Pāti Māori.

==Criticism==
Some criticisms of three-strikes laws are that they clog the court system with defendants taking cases to trial in an attempt to avoid life sentences, and clog jails with defendants who must be detained while waiting for these trials because the likelihood of a life sentence makes them a flight risk. Life imprisonment is also an expensive correctional option, and potentially inefficient given that many prisoners serving these sentences are elderly and therefore both costly to provide health care services to and statistically at low risk of recidivism. Dependants of prisoners serving long sentences may also become burdensome on welfare services.

Prosecutors have also sometimes evaded the three-strikes laws by processing arrests as parole violations rather than new offenses, or by bringing misdemeanor charges when a felony charge would have been legally justified. There is also potential for witnesses to refuse to testify, and juries to refuse to convict, if they want to keep a defendant from receiving a life sentence; this can introduce disparities in punishments, defeating the goal of treating third-time offenders uniformly. Sometimes a non-violent felony also counts as a third strike, which thus would result in a disproportionate penalty. Three-strikes laws have thus also been criticized for imposing disproportionate penalties and focusing too much on street crime rather than white-collar crime.

<text>Calder Park is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Brimbank local government area. Calder Park recorded no population at the 2021 census.

Wedged between the Calder Freeway and the Bendigo railway line, Calder Park has no residential dwellings within its bounds, with the chapel being the only structure, situated adjacent to the Calder Park Raceway. This is located in the northern half of the suburb, with the southern half comprising open fields and the adjoining Taylors Lakes.

The land located between the raceway and Taylors Lakes is zoned for future industrial use and is shown in some maps as a future industrial estate. The development type is restricted due to its proximity to Melbourne Airport and its planned future second runway project.

<text>Deer Park is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of the Melbourne central business district, located within the City of Brimbank local government area. Deer Park recorded a population of 18,145 at the 2021 census.

==History==

The suburb was originally named Kororoit Creek, after the creek running through the suburb but was renamed after the Melbourne Hunt Club used the area to house their stock of game deer. The original Hunt Club building still stands on Ballarat Road, next to the Deer Park sports oval and is now a community centre. The Hunt Club was opened on Saturday, 11 July 1885.
The Post Office opened in 1878 as Kororoit Creek, and was renamed Deer Park in 1889.

Following the discovery of gold in Ballarat and Bendigo, to the west, there became a great demand for explosives. Deer Park was chosen as the site of Melbourne&#x27;s first explosives factory, commenced by Jones Scott and Co in about 1874 and later reformed as Australian Explosives and Chemical Co, then Nobel (Australasia), Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ) and most recently Orica. The site was chosen for its isolation, as it was several miles from the outskirts of Melbourne. The availability of water in Kororoit Creek was also a factor. In the 1920s, Nobel constructed a number of houses around its factory for workers and managers, expanding the former rural village into a substantial industrial suburb.

A fatal accident at the factory in 1923 led to production of black powder being stopped. In 1928, Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICI, now Orica) took control of the factory. A new Black Powder factory was built in Deer Park in 1936 and enlarged during World War II. Charcoal from Australian timbers also began to be manufactured.

Suburban expansion in the 1920s was slowed during the 1930s depression, but in the post war period the suburb expanded rapidly. With labour shortages and a large demand for products during the post-war boom, ICI commenced housing development in Deer Park to attract workers to the area and many of the surrounding streets are named for localities in the UK, where ICI had operations.

==Transport==
Deer Park railway station is on the Serviceton railway line. The station is also served by trains running via the Regional Rail Link which forms part of the Geelong line. RRL also completed a minor upgrade to the station and that portion of the Serviceton line, and the junction between the RRL and Melton line is situated three kilometres west of Deer Park station, just beyond the former Robinsons Road level crossing.

The electrification of the train line to Deer Park was expected to occur in the 1980s, however the project has been ignored by successive State Governments. Many residents believe the delay in upgrading the train line is related to the fact that Deer Park is situated in one of the safest Labor seats in the country.

Melbourne bus routes 215, 400, 420, 422, 426 and 456 service the area, with the 422 and 420 servicing the Deer Park station.

The main road through Deer Park is Ballarat Road, which carries traffic between Melbourne and Ballarat, Victoria&#x27;s third largest city. Station Road intersects north–south with Ballarat Road and is a major local route. The Deer Park Bypass, completed in 2009, allows motorists to avoid the suburban streets of Deer Park on their journey from Melbourne to Caroline Springs, Ballarat and beyond.

==Facilities==
===Education===
Deer Park boasts two public primary schools, a Catholic primary school, and a secondary college.
* Deer Park North Primary School
* Deer Park West Primary School
* St Peter Chanel School
* Victoria University Secondary College – Junior Campus

==Flora and fauna==

Kororoit Creek is located on the northern boundary of the suburb. This area (particularly in the West) has been home to large healthy populations of native reptiles for thousands of years, including Tiger snake, Eastern blue-tongued lizard, stump-tailed skink and Eastern brown snake. Due to development, these species are now rarely seen in the area.

Due to more recent development of the Cairnlea estate and improved vegetation on the banks of Kororoit Creek, native species of frogs have taken advantage and have taken up residents in the new wetlands and lakes. The common eastern froglet and even the now endangered growling grass frog have been seen and heard in the new wetlands and around Kororoit Creek.

* Kororoit Creek Trail

==Prison==

The Deer Park Metropolitan Women&#x27;s Correctional Centre, which opened on 15 August 1996, was the first privately owned and -operated prison in Victoria. It transferred to public ownership on 3 October 2000, the government took control of the facility, and it was renamed the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre, after prison welfare campaigner Phyllis Frost. As of 2022 it is run by Corrections Victoria.

==Today==

On the southern outskirts of the suburb there are large farm properties which have now being developed for housing under the development names Brimbank Gardens and St Andrews Field. This area surrounds Mount Derrimut, which saw the relocation of the Sunshine Golf Club to allow its former location, east of Fitzgerald Road, to be redeveloped as housing.

==Sports==
Deer Park Football Club is the local Australian Rules football team, competing in the EDFL since 2023. There is also cricket, rugby union and tennis clubs in the suburb.

==Notable residents==
* Marlene Kairouz
* Nathan Phillips (actor)
* Marilyn Anderson, fellow of the Australian Academy of Science

<doc id="615743" wikidata="Q1495018" url="?curid=615743" title="Help the Aged">
<text>Help the Aged was a United Kingdom based international charity founded in 1961 by Cecil Jackson-Cole and Hugh Faulkner to help disadvantaged older people who were affected by poverty, isolation and neglect. It merged with Age Concern in 2009 to form Age UK.

==Organisation and campaigns==
Help the Aged had national offices in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. As of 2005 the Charity employed over 1,800 people and had an income of £75 million per year.

The Charity was an active campaigner on a number of issues affecting older people including:

* Elder Abuse
*Poverty among older people
* Health and Social Care
* Neighbourhoods
* Pensions and Benefits
* Isolation and loneliness

On 26 June 2008, and after years of campaigning by Help the Aged, the British Government announced new legislation aimed at making age discrimination illegal. Equalities Minister Harriet Harman unveiled the first draft of the Equalities Bill in Parliament to outlaw discrimination through the provision of goods and services on the basis of age.

Help the Aged also conducted a high-profile campaign on fuel poverty, which affects an estimated 3 million pensioners in the UK. A household is deemed to be in fuel poverty when more than 10% of its income is spent on heating the house to an adequate standard of warmth. Fuel poverty, caused by low income and non energy-efficient housing, is thought to be a main cause of excess winter deaths.

==Research into Ageing==
&quot;Research into Ageing&quot; is a medical research trust that was the research arm of Help the Aged. It operates &quot;The Disconnected Mind&quot;, a research project that seeks to improve the lives of older people by unlocking the causes of age-related mental decline.

==intune group==
In 2007, Help the Aged launched &quot;intune group&quot;, a new financial services brand. The service exists as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Charity and offers tailored financial services products including home, car and travel insurance. The charity launched the initiative to remove age discrimination as a barrier to older people wishing to access certain financial products. Any profits generated by the company go towards the charity&#x27;s work.

==Merger==
In May 2008, Help the Aged and Age Concern England announced plans for the two charities to merge. Following consultation, this was confirmed in September, when Dianne Jeffrey was confirmed as the new chair of trustees.

Tom Wright CBE, then chief executive of VisitBritain, was appointed Chief Executive of the new charity in November 2008. He is also a Trustee of the Imperial War Museum.

The merged charity – known initially as Age Concern and Help the Aged, but now branded Age UK – was formed on 1 April 2009.

<text>Mika Juhani Kaurismäki (; born 21 September 1955) is a Finnish film director.

== Early life and education==

Mika Kaurismäki was born in Orimattila. He is the elder brother of Aki Kaurismäki.
After high school, Kaurismäki worked as a painter of houses and apartments in the small town of Kuusankoski in the southeastern part of Finland. In the autumn of 1976, when the winter was coming and the annual high season for painting houses was over, he thought of doing something else in life. Still wearing his painter overalls, he walked into a bookstore and bought the newly published &quot;History of Cinema&quot; by Peter von Bagh. He started reading it from page one and decided to become a film director.
Kaurismäki studied cinema in Munich, Germany, at the Hochschule für Film und Fernsehen (1977–1981).

==Career ==
Kaurismäki&#x27;s first film, &quot;The Liar&quot; (1980), made in Finland, was his diplom film. His younger brother Aki Kaurismäki, then a student of journalism, played the main role and also co-wrote the screenplay. &quot;The Liar&quot; was an overnight sensation, when first shown in Finland; it marked the beginning of the Kaurismäki brothers&#x27; film career and started a new era in Finnish cinema. After the success of &quot;The Liar&quot;, Mika Kaurismäki decided to stay in Finland and together with his brother and some friends he founded the production company Villealfa Filmproductions, which soon became a home of vital low- or no-budget film making; by the end of the 1980s it was the third biggest film production company of all time in Finland. The Villealfa film family consisted of many colleagues and friends in addition to the Kaurismäki brothers, including the actors Matti Pellonpää and Kari Väänänen and the cinematographer Timo Salminen. Mika&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;The Clan – Tale of the Frogs&quot; was entered into the 14th Moscow International Film Festival.

Aki Kaurismäki, who had worked as Mika&#x27;s assistant and a screenwriter, began his career as a director when Mika produced his film &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1984). During the active Villealfa years, Mika co-founded the Midnight Sun Film Festival (1986) and the distribution company Senso Films (1987), and the Andorra cinemas in Helsinki.

The 1990s saw the gradual fading of the Villealfa spirit; Mika and Aki started to produce their films separately, through their own production companies. Mika had founded Marianna Films in 1987 and its first independent production was &quot;Zombie and the Ghost Train&quot; (1991).

Over the course of the 1990s Mika established his base and second home in Rio de Janeiro, and started to concentrate more in international co-productions. He made several Brazilian-themed films, including &quot;Amazon&quot;, &quot;Tigrero&quot;, &quot;Sambólico&quot;, &quot;Rytmi&quot;, and &quot;Moro no Brasil&quot;. His film &quot;Brasileirinho&quot; is a 2005 musical documentary about traditional Brazilian &quot;choro&quot; music. In 1995 in Philadelphia he directed the no-budget thriller &quot;Condition Red&quot; with James Russo, Cynda Williams and Paul Calderón. &quot;Condition Red&quot; was entered into the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. His biggest production so far is the comedy &quot;L.A. Without a Map&quot; (1998), with David Tennant, Julie Delpy, Vincent Gallo, Johnny Depp, James LeGros, Anouk Aimée, Joe Dallesandro, etc.

During the production of &quot;Moro no Brasil&quot; (2002) Kaurismäki opened a live music club, Mika&#x27;s Bar, in Rio de Janeiro, but gave it up later and decided to concentrate primarily on film making. In 2003 he was a member of the jury at the 25th Moscow International Film Festival.

On 24 August 2012, &quot;The Road North&quot;, starring Vesa-Matti Loiri and Samuli Edelmann, premiered in Finland, and has been a success with more than 200.000 viewers by the end of September 2012. Kaurismäki is the producer and co-writer of the 2012 documentary film &quot;The King – Jari Litmanen&quot; which tells about the career of Finnish footballer Jari Litmanen.

&quot;Gracious Night&quot;, starring Timo Torikka, Pertti Sveholm and Kari Heiskanen, premiered in 2020, in the Estonian Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Kaurismäki has lived in Brazil since approximately 1992. He is the father of Maria Kaurismäki. She graduated from Tampere School of Art and Media in 2008 with her movie &quot;Sideline&quot;.

<text>Dame Elmira Minita Gordon (30 December 1930 – 1 January 2021) was a Belizean educator, psychologist and politician; she served as the first governor general of Belize from its independence in 1981 until 1993. She was the first Belizean to receive a doctorate in psychology. She is one of the few &quot;double dames&quot;, having received damehoods in two separate orders: the Order of St Michael and St George and the Royal Victorian Order.

She was the first woman to serve as governor-general in the history of the Commonwealth.

==Biography==

Elmira Minita Gordon was born 30 December 1930 in Belize City, British Honduras. Her parents, Frederick Gordon and May Dakers, had immigrated from Jamaica to Lucky Strike, Belize in the 1920s. Gordon had five siblings: Lincoln Coyi, Dorinda Henderson, Kelorah Franklin, Rolston Coyi, and Robert Reyes. She grew up in Belize City, attending St. John&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School and St. Mary&#x27;s Primary. Gordon was a member of the Girl Guides from 1946. Years later, in 1970 Gordon became the District Commissioner of the Girl Guides for the Belize district. 

Gordon continued her education at St. George&#x27;s Teachers&#x27; College. She also took a correspondence course from the College of Preceptors, Oxford, England. 

After graduation, she began teaching at an Anglican school. She also served as a missionary throughout Belize between 1946 and 1958. From 1959 to 1969, she was a lecturer at the Belize Teachers&#x27; Training College. From 1969 to 1981, she served as a Government Education Officer.

Gordon graduated from the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada with a B.Ed. (1967) and an M.Ed. (1969) specialising in educational psychology. She completed postgraduate studies at the University of Nottingham and University of Birmingham in England. Between 1977 and 1980, when Gordon was in Canada, she served on the Educational Psychology Programme Planning Committee and was a member of the Toronto Leather Craft Club. She graduated with a PhD in applied psychology from the University of Toronto in 1980, becoming the first trained Belizean psychologist.

She returned to Belize after graduating. In 1981 Gordon was appointed as Governor General of Belize. She succeeded James P. I. Hennessy, the last Governor of Belize. She became the first Governor-General of Belize upon Belize gaining independence that year. 

Gordon became a justice of the peace in 1974 and a senior Justice of the Peace in 1987. Gordon received a lifetime membership of the British Red Cross in 1975, and in the Belizean Red Cross in 1981. In addition to her public works, Gordon was a master leather crafts artisan, having won numerous prizes for her works.

Gordon stepped down as Governor-General in 1993, and was succeeded by Sir Colville Young. In later years, poor health prompted her to move to the United States in 2016 to live with her sister, Kelorah Franklin. She died on 1 January 2021, in Inglewood, Los Angeles County, California, two days after her 90th birthday.

<text>Derrimut ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Brimbank Local government area. Derrimut recorded a population of 8,651 at the 2021 census.

Derrimut is a newly developed suburb in Melbourne. It is named after Derrimut, a nineteenth-century Aboriginal Elder. Derrimut is bounded by Foleys Road to the north, Robinsons Road to the west, the Western Ring Road to the east and Boundary Road to the south. Derrimut was once part of Deer Park, but was detached from the latter in 1998.

== History ==
Derrimut is located on the lands of the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people, of the Kulin Nation.

Derrimut Post Office opened on 1 June 1866 in the rural area, but closed in 1918.

The area was home to the &quot;Mount Derrimut&quot; field station of the University of Melbourne from 1964 to 1996. It focused on agriculture. The site was also used by the Victoria University Western Institute to deliver courses in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Before being used by the university, it was used by ICI (now Orica) for training and conference purposes. The site is now occupied by the Sunshine Golf Club; the course opened in November 2007.

On 10 July 2023, a chemical explosion started a fire at the ACB Group factory on Swann Drive. The explosion resulted in one of Victoria&#x27;s biggest fires in recent years. The fire left one worker dead.

<text>Aerial archaeology is the study of archaeological sites from the air. It is a method of archaeological investigation that uses aerial photography, remote sensing, and other techniques to identify, record, and interpret archaeological features and sites. Aerial archaeology has been used to discover and map a wide range of archaeological sites, from prehistoric settlements and ancient roads to medieval castles and World War II battlefields.

Aerial archaeology involves interpretation and image analysis of photographic and other kinds of images in field research to understand archaeological features, sites, and landscapes. It enables exploration and examination of context and large land areas, on a scale unparalleled by other archaeological methods. The AARG (Aerial Archaeology Research Group) boasts that &quot;more archaeological features have been found worldwide through aerial photography than by any other means of survey&quot;.

Aerial archaeological survey combines data collection and data analysis. The umbrella term &quot;aerial images&#x27;&quot; includes traditional aerial photographs, satellite images, multispectral data (which captures image data within specific wavelength ranges across the electromagnetic spectrum) and hyperspectral data (similar to multi-spectral data, but more detailed).

A vast bank of aerial images exists, with parts freely available online or at specialist libraries. These are often vertical images taken for area surveys by aircraft or satellite (not necessarily for archaeological reasons). Each year a small number of aerial images are taken by archaeologists during prospective surveys.

==History ==
=== Late-19th and early-20th century observations ===
The origins of aerial photography, which led to the rise of aerial archaeology, began in the mid-19th century with early experiments in capturing landscapes from above. The French photographer Nadar (Gaspard-Félix Tournachon), who is credited with taking the first aerial photograph from a balloon in 1858 over the outskirts of Paris. In America, a man named James Wallace Black, in 1860, became the first person to successfully take aerial photographs from a hot air balloon over Boston. Around the same time, Thaddeus Lowe, a scientist and aeronaut, also used balloons for military reconnaissance during the American Civil War.

In the years leading up to the First World War, several early attempts were made to use aerial photography for archaeological purposes, though they often faced significant technical and practical challenges. One of the earliest figures involved in this effort was Sir Henry Wellcome, a British-American pharmaceutical entrepreneur and philanthropist. In the early 1900s, Wellcome financed several archaeological expeditions in Sudan, where he employed aerial photography using a box kite to document excavations in Jebel Moya, Sudan.

Nevertheless, while the products of these efforts proved the potential value of aerial photographs for archaeological research, these early attempts to obtain usable photographs fell short. Camera technology of the time was insufficient, let alone the erstwhile methods for getting cameras into the air.

=== World War I and the birth of aerial archaeology ===
The outbreak of World War I marked a critical turning point in the development of aerial archaeology. British and Belgian air forces pioneered the use of aerial photography for reconnaissance as early as 1914, marking the beginning of a systematic approach to aerial observations. Aerial photography advanced rapidly due to its essential role in military reconnaissance. Both the Allies and Central Powers relied heavily on aerial photographs to map enemy positions and monitor battlefield activity. It was during this time that aerial photography techniques improved dramatically, particularly in terms of camera technology, altitude, and film quality. The use of specialized reconnaissance aircraft, which were equipped with advanced cameras, allowed for the collection of high-resolution images on a scale and precision previously unattainable.

Although aerial photography during the war was primarily a military tool, its application to archaeology was soon recognized. The thousands of aerial photographs captured over Europe revealed previously unknown archaeological features, such as crop marks, that were visible from the air but invisible from the ground. These images, primarily intended for military strategy, revealed unexpected archaeological features, especially in Europe. This discovery highlighted the potential of aerial photography not just for military purposes but also for archaeological discovery and documentation.

After the war, many of the techniques and technologies developed during the conflict were adopted by archaeologists. Figures like English archaeologist O.G.S. Crawford, who is widely considered the &quot;father of aerial archaeology,&quot; were instrumental in applying wartime advances to peacetime archaeological research. Crawford recognized the potential of aerial photography for archaeological research and conducted extensive surveys of the English landscape from the air. He published numerous articles and books on the subject, laying the foundation for the development of aerial archaeology as a scientific discipline. Crawford&#x27;s systematic use of aerial photography in the 1920s marked the beginning of modern aerial archaeology, building on the foundations laid by earlier pioneers and the technological leaps made during the war.

=== O.G.S. Crawford and the systematic use of aerial photography ===
In the 1920s, Osbert Guy Stanhope Crawford emerged as a key figure in the development of aerial archaeology. Crawford recognized the potential of aerial photography for systematically documenting archaeological sites. His work in Britain and the Middle East demonstrated that aerial surveys could reveal features such as crop marks and soil disturbances that were undetectable from ground level. His pioneering efforts helped establish aerial archaeology as a legitimate and essential method within the broader field of archaeological research.

Major G. W. G. Allen was an English engineer who, after learning of the work Crawford was doing, he was inspired to use his own airplane around Southern England, taking photographs of the landscape. His work in documenting prehistoric landscapes and Roman roads in England marked a significant advancement in the application of aerial methods for archaeological surveys.

=== Post-war expansion ===

==== Technological advances ====
Following the Second World War, advancements in aerial photography and imaging techniques significantly broadened the scope of aerial archaeology. The introduction of infrared photography and multispectral imaging enabled archaeologists to detect subtle variations in vegetation and soil, allowing for the identification of buried structures that would otherwise remain hidden. These technological innovations made it possible to conduct more detailed and accurate surveys, further enhancing the effectiveness of aerial archaeology.

==== Global expansion of aerial archaeology ====
In the post-war period, aerial archaeology expanded beyond Europe, becoming an invaluable tool for researchers working in regions with vast and difficult-to-access landscapes, such as the Americas, Africa, and Asia. In these areas, aerial surveys uncovered ancient civilizations and revealed the locations of significant archaeological sites, many of which had been previously unknown. The ability to survey large areas quickly and efficiently made aerial archaeology a critical tool for understanding diverse archaeological landscapes across the globe.

=== Modern aerial archaeology ===

==== Drones and UAVs ====
In recent years, the advent of drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), has revolutionized aerial archaeology. Drones offer greater flexibility and lower operational costs compared to traditional manned aircraft. With the ability to capture high-resolution images and access areas that are otherwise difficult to reach, drones have become an essential tool for modern archaeological surveys. The increased use of drones has made aerial archaeology more accessible to a broader range of researchers and has led to more frequent and detailed studies of archaeological landscapes.

==== LiDAR and photogrammetry ====
Technological advancements such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and photogrammetry have further enhanced aerial archaeology. LiDAR, in particular, is capable of penetrating dense vegetation to reveal features hidden beneath forest canopies, making it an invaluable tool for studying heavily forested regions. Photogrammetry, which allows for the creation of precise 3D models of archaeological sites, has enabled researchers to document and analyze sites with unprecedented accuracy. Together, these technologies have expanded the potential of aerial archaeology, allowing for more detailed and comprehensive analyses of archaeological sites.

Pioneers of aerial archaeology include:

* O. G. S. Crawford (England): Pioneered the use of aerial photography for archaeological survey.
* Roger Agache (France): A leading figure in the development of aerial archaeology in France, known for his work on Gallo-Roman sites.
* Antoine Poidebard (Syria): Used aerial photography to study Roman limes in the Middle East.
* Dache McClain Reeves (United States): A pioneer in the use of aerial photography to study Native American archaeology in the United States.
* Henry Wellcome (Sudan)
* Lionel Rees (Jordan)
* Giacomo Boni (Italy)

== Applications of aerial archaeology ==
Aerial archaeology plays a crucial role in discovering new archaeological sites and mapping their extent. By providing a bird&#x27;s-eye view, aerial images can reveal subtle features and patterns that are often invisible from the ground. This is particularly valuable in areas with:

* Dense vegetation: Aerial photography can penetrate tree canopies and reveal hidden earthworks, structures, and other features obscured by foliage.
* Large-scale features: Extensive archaeological landscapes, such as ancient field systems, roads, or settlements, are often best appreciated and understood from the air.
* Inaccessible terrain: Aerial reconnaissance allows archaeologists to survey remote or difficult-to-access areas, such as mountains, deserts, or wetlands, where ground surveys would be challenging.

=== Identifying and recording archaeological features ===
Aerial images provide a wealth of information for identifying and recording archaeological features. These include:

* Earthworks: Banks, ditches, mounds, and other earthworks often create subtle variations in topography that are readily visible in aerial photographs, particularly when illuminated by low-angle sunlight.
* Cropmarks and soil marks: Variations in plant growth or soil color can reveal the presence of buried features, such as walls, ditches, or pits.
* Stone structures: Walls, buildings, and other stone structures can often be identified by their shape, shadow, and texture in aerial images.
* Ancient land use: Traces of past human activities, such as field systems, roads, and canals, can often be detected in aerial photographs.

By carefully analyzing aerial images, archaeologists can identify, document, and interpret a wide range of archaeological features, providing valuable insights into past human activities and settlement patterns.

=== Creating site plans and maps ===
Aerial photographs provide the foundation for creating accurate and detailed site plans and maps. This involves:

* Georeferencing: Aligning aerial images with real-world coordinates, ensuring accurate spatial referencing.
* Orthorectification: Correcting for geometric distortions in aerial images, creating a planimetrically accurate representation of the ground.
* Mapping features: Tracing the outlines of archaeological features identified in the imagery, creating a digital record of the site.
* Creating topographic maps: Using aerial photographs and elevation data to generate contour maps that illustrate the shape and relief of the terrain.

These site plans and maps are essential for documenting archaeological sites, planning excavations, and managing cultural heritage resources. They provide a valuable record of the site&#x27;s extent, features, and spatial context, aiding in interpretation and future research.

== Techniques and technologies ==
=== Aerial photography ===
Photography is the most common method used in aerial archaeology. Archaeologists use specialized cameras and lenses to capture high-resolution images of the ground from aircraft or drones.

==== Oblique vs. vertical photography ====
Aerial photographs can be captured from different angles, each offering distinct advantages for archaeological investigation:

* Oblique photography: Taken at an angle, oblique photographs provide a more familiar perspective, similar to what the human eye would see. This allows for easier recognition of features and provides a sense of depth and context. Oblique images are particularly useful for visualizing the relationship between archaeological sites and their surrounding landscape.
* Vertical photography: Captured directly overhead, vertical photographs offer a planimetric view, minimizing distortion and enabling accurate measurements and mapping. These images are ideal for creating precise site plans, documenting the extent of archaeological features, and monitoring changes over time.
The choice between oblique and vertical photography depends on the specific research questions and the characteristics of the site being investigated. Often, archaeologists utilize a combination of both techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the archaeological record.

=== Identifying archaeological features in aerial images ===
Certain archaeological features are more visible from the air than on the ground due to their nature. A key concept behind interpretation in aerial archaeology is that formation processes affect site features differently after abandonment. For a site to be detected by a remote sensing method, one would expect alterations to the soil or subsoil e.g. ditches, pits, banks, mounds, walls etc. which often are visible in relief.

Tiny differences in ground conditions caused by buried features can be emphasized by a number of factors and viewed from the air:
* Shadow marks: slight differences in ground levels will cast shadows when the sun is low and are best from above.
* Cropmarks: buried ditches will hold more water and buried walls will hold less water than undisturbed ground, which causes crops to grow taller or shorter, and therefore define buried features, e.g. as tonal or color differences.
*Soil marks: slight differences in soil color between natural deposits and archaeological ones can also often show in ploughed fields as.
*Frost marks: frost can also appear in winter on ploughed fields where water has naturally accumulated along the lines of buried features.
* Water pooling: differences in levels and buried features will also affect the way surface water behaves across a site, producing striking effects after heavy rain.
For a three-dimensional effect, an overlapping pair of vertical photographs, taken from slightly offset positions, can be viewed stereoscopically.

=== Remote sensing ===
Beyond traditional aerial photography, archaeologists utilize a range of remote sensing techniques to investigate sites without physical excavation. These methods involve collecting data from a distance using specialized sensors that detect and record different forms of electromagnetic radiation. This information can reveal subsurface features, variations in vegetation, and other archaeological clues hidden from the naked eye. Digital data, for example, ALS, can be used effectively in &quot;heavily automated workflows,&quot; (a process that uses rule-based logic to launch tasks that run without human intervention), e.g. a six-year project using supervised automated classification to survey of Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany, identified as many as 600,000 possible sites.

The NASA LANDSAT series (satellite observations) are often used in aerial archaeology. Renfrew and Bahn describes the techniques used as scanners that &quot;record the intensity of reflected light and the infrared radiation from the earth surface and convert these electronically into photographic images.&quot; LANDSAT images have helped in identifying large-scale features, such as an ancient riverbed running from the Saudi Arabian desert to Kuwait.

SLAR (sideways looking airborne radar) is a remote sensing technique that records pulses of electromagnetic radiation from an aircraft. Richard Adams used SLAR to identify a matrix of possible Mayan water irrigation systems underneath the dense rainforest from a NASA aircraft.

SAR (synthetic aperture radar) involves radar images that are processed to create high-resolution data. This technique stands out, as weather conditions and nightfall do not affect its results. Renfrew and Bahn describe it as a &quot;rapid non-destructive alternative to surface survey that does not involve the collection of artifacts.&quot; It can be faster and less time-consuming than surface survey.

=== LiDAR ===
LiDAR (light detection and ranging) aka ALS (airborne laser scanning) uses laser scanner pulses to measure the distance to the ground and other objects. By emitting thousands of pulses per second and recording the time it takes for them to return to the sensor, LiDAR creates highly accurate 3D models of the Earth&#x27;s surface. In archaeology, LiDAR is invaluable for:

* Mapping terrain: LiDAR can penetrate dense vegetation, revealing subtle variations in topography that may indicate the presence of buried features like walls, ditches, or mounds.
* Creating digital elevation models (DEMs): These models provide detailed representations of the ground surface, allowing archaeologists to identify archaeological features that are not readily apparent on the ground.
* Visualizing landscapes: LiDAR data can be used to create stunning visualizations of archaeological landscapes, aiding in the interpretation of site layout and land use patterns.

=== Satellite imagery ===
In places yet to be documented (or where maps are considered confidential), satellite imagery is vital to providing base maps for excavation. Satellite imagery offers a broad perspective, covering vast areas and providing valuable data for regional studies and landscape archaeology. Different types of satellites capture various wavelengths of light, providing information about:

* Vegetation patterns: Analyzing variations in vegetation health and density can reveal traces of ancient structures or land use practices.
* Soil composition: Satellite imagery can help identify different soil types, which can be associated with past human activities.
* Land use changes: Monitoring changes in land use over time can provide insights into settlement patterns and environmental impacts.

One of the useful resources for accessing satellite imagery is Google Earth. This platform includes a range of different satellite and aerial images, such as the NASA LANDSAT series, Ikonos, QuickBird, GeoEye alongside more.

The Cold War CORONA satellite photographs have been used extensively for base maps and provisional interpretation. In contrast to other imagery, CORONA uses two images of the same feature to create a stereoscopic view, which can allow for more accurate examination and interpretation in 3D.

=== Thermal imaging ===
Thermal imaging captures infrared radiation emitted by objects, revealing differences in temperature. In archaeology, this can be used to:

* Detect buried structures: Walls, foundations, and other subsurface features may retain heat differently than the surrounding soil, creating thermal anomalies visible in thermal images.
* Identify moisture patterns: Variations in soil moisture can affect temperature, revealing potential archaeological features.
* Monitor site conditions: Thermal imaging can help assess the condition of archaeological sites and identify areas at risk of damage.

ASTER (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer) is used to create maps of &quot;land surface temperature, reflectance, and elevation.&quot; It is attached to the side of satellite Terra and can be used to create digital elevation models.

=== Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging ===
These advanced imaging techniques capture data across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, going beyond the visible light captured by traditional cameras.

* Multispectral imaging: Records data in a select number of broader wavelength bands, often including infrared and ultraviolet light. This can help differentiate between subtle variations in vegetation, soil, and building materials, aiding in the identification of archaeological features.
* Hyperspectral imaging: Acquires data in hundreds of very narrow, contiguous spectral bands, providing a detailed spectral signature for each pixel in the image. This allows for precise identification of materials based on their unique spectral properties, which can be used to map different types of vegetation, identify buried features, and even analyze the composition of archaeological materials.

=== Data processing and interpretation ===
For data analysis, aerial images must be analyzed and interpreted using specialized skill-sets. This includes an understanding of formation processes as well as contemporary history and landscape history. Often aerial archaeology will be carried out using computer programmed (such as GIS) aiding interpretation. The raw data collected through aerial photography and remote sensing requires careful processing and interpretation to extract meaningful archaeological information. This involves:

* Georeferencing: Aligning images with real-world coordinates, ensuring accurate spatial referencing.
* Orthorectification: Correcting for geometric distortions in aerial images, creating a planimetrically accurate representation of the ground.
* Image enhancement: Applying various techniques to improve image clarity, highlight subtle features, and remove noise.
* Feature extraction: Identifying and delineating archaeological features from the imagery, often aided by visual interpretation and image analysis software.
* Spatial analysis: Using GIS software to analyze the spatial relationships between archaeological features and their surrounding landscape.

=== Photogrammetry and 3D modeling ===
Photogrammetry is a technique for creating 3D models from overlapping photographs. By analyzing the different perspectives captured in multiple images, specialized software can reconstruct the geometry of the scene. In archaeology, photogrammetry is used to:

* Create detailed 3D models of sites and artifacts: These models can be used for documentation, analysis, and virtual exploration.
* Generate accurate measurements and plans: Precise dimensions and spatial relationships can be extracted from the 3D models.
* Monitor site changes: Comparing models created at different times can reveal subtle changes in site condition, aiding in conservation efforts.

=== GIS applications ===
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are essential tools in modern archaeology, providing a powerful platform for managing, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. In aerial archaeology, GIS plays a crucial role in:

* Data integration: GIS allows archaeologists to combine data from various sources, such as aerial photographs, satellite imagery, LiDAR, and ground surveys, into a single georeferenced database. This facilitates a holistic understanding of the site and its surrounding landscape.
* Spatial analysis: GIS enables sophisticated spatial analysis, allowing archaeologists to investigate patterns and relationships within the data. This includes analyzing site distribution, identifying clusters of features, and modeling the relationship between sites and environmental factors.
* Predictive modeling: By analyzing known site locations and environmental variables, GIS can be used to predict the likelihood of finding undiscovered archaeological sites in a given area. This helps prioritize survey efforts and increases the efficiency of archaeological investigations.
* Visualization and interpretation: GIS provides tools for creating maps, 3D visualizations, and interactive displays of archaeological data. This aids in interpreting the spatial context of sites, communicating findings to stakeholders, and engaging the public with archaeological research.

=== Image enhancement and analysis techniques ===
Raw aerial images often require enhancement to improve their clarity and highlight archaeological features. Various digital image processing techniques are employed, including:

* Contrast stretching: Increases the difference between light and dark tones in an image, making subtle features more apparent.
* Spatial filtering: Reduces noise and enhances edges, improving the visibility of linear features like walls or roads.
* Band ratioing: Combines data from different spectral bands to highlight specific features or materials, such as vegetation or soil types.
* Principal component analysis (PCA): Reduces data redundancy and highlights subtle variations in multispectral or hyperspectral images.
* Classification: Assigns pixels to different categories based on their spectral properties, helping to identify and map different types of land cover or archaeological features.

These image enhancement and analysis techniques are crucial for extracting meaningful information from aerial imagery, allowing archaeologists to identify subtle archaeological features and interpret their significance within the broader landscape.

== Case studies ==
* Nazca Lines, Peru: Aerial photography played a crucial role in documenting and understanding the enigmatic Nazca Lines, giant geoglyphs etched into the desert.
* Angkor Wat, Cambodia: Aerial laser scanning (LiDAR) has been used to map the extensive temple complex of Angkor Wat and its surrounding landscape, revealing previously unknown features.
* Caracol, Belize: LiDAR surveys have helped to map the ancient Maya city of Caracol, revealing its size and complexity.
* Roman Limes in the Middle East: Antoine Poidebard&#x27;s pioneering work using aerial photography to document the Roman frontier fortifications.

=== Caracol, Mayan City ===
Aerial archaeology, specifically LIDAR, was used to study Caracol, a Mayan city in Belize, dated to 550-900 AD. Archaeologists Arlen and Diane Chase, from the University of Central Florida, worked for 25 years in the dense tropical rainforest, managing to map of settlement. At the end of the dry season of 2009, they embarked on four continuous days of LIDAR flying, followed by three weeks of analysis by remote sensing experts. This allowed them to surpass the results of the prior 25 years, revealing over of city—a far larger area than expected. Furthermore, the landscape was modelled in 3D, leading to the discovery of possible new sites such as &quot;ruins, agricultural terraces and stone causeways&quot; (to be investigated further for a greater understanding). We can thus see the impressive effect aerial methods can have on streamlining archaeological survey, and pushing the limits of what is possible.

=== Homs, Syria ===
Homs, Syria provides an example of how different types of satellite imagery can be used in combination. The site is based in an area notorious for its difficulties surrounding archaeological survey, as the diversity of terrain makes the detection of archaeological sites difficult. As a result, Homs is a perfect candidate for aerial reconnaissance. Modern agriculture often obscures remains through practices such as deep ploughing (which removes many levees and low-lying sites from the archaeological record). Furthermore, vegetation of different types/densities frequently disguises sites, impeding site visibility.

The Homs projects combined the usage of CORONA, LANDSAT, IKONOS, and Quickbird imagery to observe &quot;long-term human and environmental interactions&quot; and, more broadly, to assess the landscape, over an area of 630 quare kilometres that had no prior database of remains or aerial photography. Through fieldwork, the different applications and abilities of these satellite imagery techniques were revealed, highlighting the importance of using multiple methods of archaeological investigation together.

The LANDSAT imagery fell short when used for site detection and mapping, due to its lower resolution compared to Quickbird and IKONOS, but was most successful at characterizing the environment and visualizing rates of change.

CORONA imagery successfully detected single-period sites, which could not be detected by IKONOS. Furthermore, CORONA imagery assisted in exposing ancient field systems, and crop marks within fields, revealing early watercourses.

In this instance, visual detection and interpretation of satellite imagery proved more useful than processing LANDSAT imagery.

Through interpretation archaeological sites were identified as tells with low-relief soil markings, &quot;with remains ranging from small walls less than 1 m wide to large multi period settlements.&quot; The projects as a whole demonstrated how valuable aerial archaeology is to archaeological survey, especially across terrains where other techniques are not possible.

<doc id="615753" wikidata="Q6382123" url="?curid=615753" title="Kealba, Victoria">
<text>Kealba ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Brimbank local government area. Kealba recorded a population of 3,226 the 2021 census.

The name of the suburb is derived from the letters of two of its neighbouring suburbs, namely Keilor and St Albans.

==History==

The land was part of the Overnewton Estate owned by William Taylor, who had Overnewton Castle built on the Calder Highway. After the Government demanded the release of land by large landowners, two large farm allotments were sold to Farquhar Macrae and his wife Annie (née Ritchie). After the Macraes&#x27; death, the land contained in the suburb of Kealba was owned by their son Malcolm Ritchie Macrae. The farm was used to grow oats and for the breeding of horses, cows and sheep.

During the 1960s the land was sold for subdivisional purposes, the first land auction taking place on 22 March 1969. During this time the area came under the St. Albans postal district, 3021, and was called St Albans.

Over the following years all the land was subdivided and in February 1970, a school, Kealba Secondary College (originally named St Albans Park High School) was established. In July 1970, the principal, Mr Leo Webb, requested that the name be changed due to the confusion with St Albans High. A community group was formed to choose a name (former Mayor Ciro Lombardi was part of this group). The group originally put forward the names &#x27;Albakei&#x27;, &#x27;Keialba&#x27; and &#x27;Kealba&#x27; which were a combination of the names Keilor and St Albans. The group settled on the name &#x27;Kealba Secondary College&#x27;.

After changing the schools name to Kealba Secondary College and Under the Survey Co-Ordination Act 1958, the City of Keilor applied to a name changed from St Albans East to the name of Kealba. The location was named as being – that portion of the City bounded by St Albans Road, Taylors Creek, the Maribyrnong River, McIntyre Road, Main Road East and Sunshine Avenue. A few light industrial areas in Malcolm Court and Stenson Rd were later added.

In the early 1970s, the main road that runs along the centre of Kealba (Driscolls Rd) was originally called Fox Rd. The reason for the name change was due to the confusion with a street in St Albans called Fox St. Many residents were consistently receiving the wrong mail or none at all due to the difference. The problem became increasingly evident when a foam insulation company incorrectly carried out a job on a house in Fox St rather than Fox Rd. The residents then lobbied the council to have the name of the road changed from Fox Rd to Driscolls Rd.

In the late 1970s, a severe storm caused damage to half a dozen homes in which a number of them were completely destroyed.

In the 1990s without any consultations with the residents, the council renamed the area bounded by Main Road East, Cowper Avenue, Errington Road and Sunshine Avenue as St Albans. Today the area is still known to many as Kealba, or by its original name Kealba Views.

In the late 1990s, the land to the east of Stenson Rd was subdivided and released for sale. This land was marketed as &#x27;Observatory Point&#x27; due to the views of the Brimbank Park, EJ Whitten Bridge and the Melbourne CBD. This is the reason for the names &#x27;Orbital Drive&#x27;, &#x27;Meteor Rise&#x27;, &#x27;Nebula Court&#x27; and &#x27;Pulsar Place&#x27;. A nearby section was subdivided afterwards hence why the name &#x27;Henley Court&#x27; does not conform to the space theme.

In 2011, Kealba Secondary College merged with Victoria University Secondary College. Due to the low number of students attending the Kealba Secondary College, the school relocated to new sites in Deer Park and Cairnlea and Kealba Secondary College was closed down. In 2016, the Victorian education department had deemed the site &quot;surplus&quot; and listed the 6.07-hectare site for sale by public tender. In July 2017, the local newspaper, Star Weekly, reported that the Kealba Secondary site had been sold for $24.16 million. In 2019, a Development Plan was submitted by the land owner for the development of the site into 218 dwellings. Local residents campaigned against the plan due to the overdevelopment of the site and the impact it was have on the neighbouring houses. The local council voted against the Development Plan which was subsequently lodged to VCAT. In September 2019, the application was rejected by VCAT. The site is currently vacant.

== Environmental issues ==
=== Sunshine Landfill and Odour pollution ===
Sunshine Landfill was operated by Barro Group and handled construction waste and shredded tyres since 2015. The landfill has had four underground fires burning for three years starting in 2019 which produced a smell described as &quot;rotting carcasses&quot; and was the result of oxygen being in contact with decomposed waste.

EPA charged Barro Group and its three directors with several breaches of their general environmental duty which implies the need for polluters to take reasonable steps to minimise the risks to human health and the environment from their pollution.

The penalty faced in 2022 was up to $1.8 million for the company and $360,000 for each individual director.

Both EPA Victoria and Barro Group monitored the air quality and concluded that the long-term risk to health from the smell was low.

Early 2023, the licence to operate the landfill, which was suspended in 2021 got cancelled by EPA and the remaining fire kept burning.

<text>Keilor is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Brimbank and Hume local government areas. Keilor recorded a population of 5,906 at the 2021 census.

Whilst most of the suburb is contained within the City of Brimbank, the northern section of Keilor, north of the Calder Freeway, is within the City of Hume. This section of the suburb is located on the flood plain of the Maribyrnong River, and is home to many market gardens.

The suburb is mainly residential with large industrial developments in adjacent suburbs. There are several shopping centres in the area including Keilor Shopping Centre and Watergardens Town Centre approximately 5 km away.

==History==
Keilor is a township in a basin of the Maribyrnong River. James Watson from Scotland was the first land-holder in the district and also gave the suburb its name. Keilor in the early times of the gold diggings was a noted camping place for bullock teams to and from the diggings at Castlemaine and Ballarat. Spanning the river was a wooden bridge which was replaced by an iron bridge in 1868.

About 1 million years ago lava covered the previous landscape and created basalt plains. Over time, the Maribyrnong River carved itself through the basalt plains. Australian megafauna including 3-metre high kangaroos and Diprotodons were found in the area until extinction about 13,000 years ago at the end of the ice age.

The Wurundjeri Indigenous Australians inhabited the area for approximately 40,000 years. It is one of the oldest inhabited sites in Australia.

In about 1838-39 the first European settlements were established by pastoralists James Watson and Alexander and John Hunter. James Watson is thought to have named their home station after a farm called Keillor &lt;sic&gt; in Forfarshire, Scotland, one of four which his father, Hugh Watson, tenanted.

One of the earliest settlers in Keilor was William Taylor (1818–1903) who in 1849 bought 13,000 acres in the district and built a house which he called Overnewton. He transformed this building in 1859 into a Scottish Baronial mansion known today as Overnewton Castle.

In the 1850s people would stopover at Keilor during their travels from Melbourne to the Bendigo goldfields. Keilor saw an influx of new settlers who intended to cash in on this new market. Keilor Post Office opened on 2 March 1854 and a general store, blacksmith, hotel, police station, courthouse and bridge were all built during this time. The area became an agricultural district and remained so until after World War II when the suburb saw a rapid increase in population due to cheap land and the establishment of large industries in surrounding suburbs.

==Sport==

Keilor Football Club, an Australian Rules football team, competes in the Essendon District Football League.

Golfers play at the Keilor Public Golf Course on the Calder Highway in the neighbouring suburb of Keilor North.

==Facilities==

Keilor Fire Station is a Melbourne suburban fire station.

==Notable people==
* Mark Viduka, English Premier League player and former captain of the Australian National Football Team, grew up in Keilor.
* Dante Exum, NBA basketball player, played for Keilor
* Brendan O&#x27;Connor (politician), former federal minister, lives in Keilor.
