<text>Manfred baron von Ardenne (; 20 January 190726 May 1997) was a German researcher, autodidact in applied physics, and an inventor. He took out approximately 600 patents in fields including electron microscopy, medical technology, nuclear technology, plasma physics, and radio and television technology. From 1928 to 1945, he directed his self-funded and private research laboratory &quot;Forschungslaboratorium für Elektronenphysik&quot;, where he developed and invented many techniques used in modern physics. 

After the World War II, von Ardenne was held in Soviet custody and was one of many of the German nuclear physicists in the former Soviet program of nuclear weapons, and later honored with the Stalin Prize by the former Soviet Union. 

Upon his return to the then East Germany, he started another private engineering firm, &quot;Forschungsinstitut Manfred von Ardenne&quot;. Ardenne is seen as one of the main inventors of the television.

==Career==

===Early years===

The stormy life of von Ardenne&#x27;s grandmother, Elisabeth von Ardenne (1853–1952), is said to have been the inspiration for &quot;Effi Briest&quot; by Theodor Fontane, one of the most famous German realist novels.

Born in 1907 in Hamburg to a wealthy aristocratic family, Ardenne was the oldest of five children. In 1913, Ardenne&#x27;s father, assigned to the &quot;Kriegsministerium&quot;, moved to Berlin. From Ardenne&#x27;s earliest youth, he was intrigued by any form of technology, and this was fostered by his parents. Ardenne&#x27;s early education was at home through private teachers. In Berlin, from 1919, Ardenne attended the &quot;Realgymnasium&quot;, where he pursued his interests in physics and technology. In a school competition, he submitted models of a camera and an alarm system, for which he was awarded first place.

In 1923, at the age of 15, he received his first patent for an electronic tube with multiple (three) systems in a single tube for applications in wireless telegraphy. At this time, Ardenne prematurely left the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; to pursue the development of radio engineering with the entrepreneur Siegmund Loewe, who became his mentor. Loewe built the inexpensive Loewe-Ortsempfänger OE333 with Ardenne&#x27;s multiple system electronic tube. In 1925, from patent sales and publication income, Ardenne substantially improved the broadband amplifier (resistance-coupled amplifier), which was fundamental to the development of television and radar.

Without an Abitur, because he did not graduate from the &quot;Gymnasium&quot;, Ardenne entered university-level study of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. After four semesters, he left his formal studies, due to the inflexibility of the university system, and educated himself; he became an autodidact and devoted himself to applied physics research.

In 1928, he came into his inheritance with full control as to how it could be spent, and he established his private research laboratory &quot;Forschungslaboratorium für Elektronenphysik&quot;, in Berlin-Lichterfelde, to conduct his own research on radio and television technology and electron microscopy. He invented the scanning electron microscope. He financed the laboratory with income he received from his inventions and from contracts with other concerns. For example, his research on nuclear physics and high-frequency technology was financed by the &quot;Reichspostministerium&quot; (RPM, Reich Postal Ministry), headed by Wilhelm Ohnesorge. M von Ardenne attracted top-notch personnel to work in his facility, such as the nuclear physicist Fritz Houtermans, in 1940. Ardenne also conducted research on isotope separation. The small list of equipment Ardenne had in the laboratory is impressive for a private laboratory. For example, when on 10 May 1945 he was visited by NKVD Colonel General V. A. Makhnjov, accompanied by Soviet physicists Isaak Kikoin, Lev Artsimovich, Georgy Flyorov, and V. V. Migulin (of the Russian Alsos operation), they praised the research being conducted and the equipment, including an electron microscope, a 60-ton cyclotron, and plasma-ionic isotope separation installation.

At the Berlin Radio Show in August 1931, Ardenne gave the world&#x27;s first public demonstration of a television system using a cathode-ray tube for both transmission and reception. (Ardenne never developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film.) Ardenne achieved his first transmission of television pictures on 24 December 1933, followed by test runs for a public television service in 1934. The world&#x27;s first electronically scanned television service then started in Berlin in 1935, the Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow, culminating in the live broadcast of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games from Berlin to public places all over Germany.

In 1937, Ardenne developed the scanning transmission electron microscope. During World War II, he took part in the study and application of radar.

In 1941 the &quot;&quot; of the &quot;Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften&quot; was awarded to Ardenne, and in January 1945, he received the title of &quot;Reichsforschungsrat&quot; (Empire Research Advisor).

===In the Soviet Union===

Von Ardenne, Gustav Hertz, Nobel laureate and director of Research Laboratory II at Siemens, Peter Adolf Thiessen, ordinarius professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin and director of the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für physikalische Chemie und Elektrochemie (KWIPC) in Berlin-Dahlem, and Max Volmer, ordinarius professor and director of the Physical Chemistry Institute at the Berlin Technische Hochschule, had made a pact. The pact was a pledge that whoever first made contact with the Soviets would speak for the rest. The objectives of their pact were threefold: (1) Prevent plunder of their institutes, (2) Continue their work with minimal interruption, and (3) Protect themselves from prosecution for any political acts of the past. Before the end of World War II, Thiessen, a member of the NSDAP, had Communist contacts. On 27 April 1945, Thiessen arrived at von Ardenne&#x27;s institute in an armored vehicle with a major of the Soviet Army, who was also a leading Soviet chemist, and they issued Ardenne a protective letter (&quot;Schutzbrief&quot;).

All four of the pact members were taken to the Soviet Union. Von Ardenne was made head of Institute A, in Sinop, a suburb of Sukhumi. In his first meeting with Lavrentiy Beria, von Ardenne was asked to participate in the Soviet atomic bomb project, but von Ardenne quickly realized that participation would prohibit his repatriation to Germany, so he suggested isotope enrichment as an objective, which was agreed to.

Goals of Ardenne&#x27;s Institute A included: (1) Electromagnetic separation of isotopes, for which von Ardenne was the leader, (2) Techniques for manufacturing porous barriers for isotope separation, for which Peter Adolf Thiessen was the leader, and (3) Molecular techniques for separation of uranium isotopes, for which Max Steenbeck was the leader; Steenbeck was a colleague of Hertz at Siemens.

Others at Institute A included Ingrid Schilling, Alfred Schimohr, Gerhard Siewert, and Ludwig Ziehl. By the end of the 1940s, nearly 300 Germans were working at the institute, and they were not the total work force.

Hertz was made head of Institute G, in Agudseri (Agudzery), about 10 km southeast of Sukhumi and a suburb of Gul’rips (Gulrip&#x27;shi); after 1950, Hertz moved to Moscow. Volmer went to the Nauchno-Issledovatel&#x27;skiy Institut-9 (NII-9, Scientific Research Institute No. 9), in Moscow; he was given a design bureau to work on the production of heavy water. In Institute A, Thiessen became leader for developing techniques for manufacturing porous barriers for isotope separation.

At the suggestion of authorities, Ardenne eventually shifted his research from isotope separation to plasma research directed towards controlled nuclear fusion.

In 1947, Ardenne was awarded a Stalin Prize for his development of a table-top electron microscope. In 1953, before his return to Germany, he was awarded a Stalin Prize, first class, for contributions to the atomic bomb project; the money from this prize, 100,000 Rubles, was used to buy the land for his private institute in East Germany. According to an agreement that Ardenne made with authorities in the Soviet Union soon after his arrival, the equipment which he brought to the Soviet Union from his laboratory in Berlin-Lichterfelde was not to be considered as &quot;reparations&quot; to the Soviet Union. Ardenne took the equipment with him in December 1954 when he returned to the then East Germany.

===Return to (East) Germany===
After Ardenne&#x27;s arrival in the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (DDR), he became &quot;Professor für elektrotechnische Sonderprobleme der Kerntechnik&quot; (Professor of electrotechnical special problems of Nuclear Technology) at the Technische Hochschule Dresden. He also founded his research institute, &quot;Forschungsinstitut Manfred von Ardenne&quot;, in Dresden, which with over 500 employees became a unique institution in East Germany as a leading research institute that was privately run. However it collapsed with substantial debts after German reunification in 1991 and re-emerged as Von Ardenne Anlagentechnik GmbH. Ardenne twice won the GDR&#x27;s National Prize.

In 1957, Ardenne became a member of the &quot;Forschungsrat&quot; of the DDR. In that year, he developed an endoradiosonde for medical diagnostics. In 1958, he was awarded the &quot;Nationalpreis&quot; of the DDR; the same year he became a member of the &quot;Friedensrat&quot;. In 1959, he received a patent for the electron-beam furnace he developed. In 1961, he was selected a chairman of the &quot;Internationale Gesellschaft für medizinische Elektronik und biomedizinische Technik&quot;. From the 1960s, he expanded his medical research and became well known for his oxygen multi-step therapy and cancer multi-step therapy.

In 1963, Ardenne became president of the &quot;Kulturbund&quot; of the DDR. During the period 1963 to 1989, he was a delegate to the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; of the DDR, as well as a member of the &quot;Kulturbund-Fraktion&quot;.

After the creation of the Dresden-Hamburg city partnership (1987), Ardenne became an honorary citizen of Dresden in September 1989.

At the time of his death on 26 May 1997, Ardenne held around 600 patents.

In 2002 the German &quot;Europäische Forschungsgesellschaft Dünne Schichten&quot; (&quot;European Thin-Film Research Society&quot;) named an annual prize in von Ardenne&#x27;s honor.

<text>Betws-y-Coed (; meaning &#x27;prayer-house in the woods&#x27;) is a village and community in the Conwy valley in Conwy County Borough, Wales, located in the historic county of Caernarfonshire, right on the boundary with Denbighshire, in the Gwydir Forest. It is now a very popular visitor destination in the Snowdonia National Park. The population of the community as of the 2021 census was 476, a decline on the previous census.

The village has a large village green which is bounded on its western side by the A5 trunk road. There are numerous 19th-century buildings, including outdoor clothing shops, hotels, and the Church of St Mary.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the village comes from the Welsh words &quot;betws&quot; (a borrowing from the Old English &quot;bed-hus&quot; &#x27;a prayer-house&#x27; or &#x27;oratory&#x27;) and &quot;y coed&quot; (&#x27;the wood&#x27;). The name therefore means &#x27;prayer-house in the wood&#x27;. The earliest record of the name is &quot;Betus&quot; in 1254. 

The Welsh Language Commissioner gives the standard form of the name as &quot;Betws-y-coed&quot;, with a lower case &#x27;c&#x27;. The local community council gives the name as &quot;Betws-y-Coed&quot;, with an upper case &#x27;C&#x27;.

== History ==

The village, which is now within the Snowdonia National Park, stands in a valley near the point where the River Llugwy and the River Lledr join the River Conwy. The location is where a Celtic Christian community founded a monastery in the late 6th century AD. A village developed around the site over subsequent centuries. In the medieval period, the local lead mining industry brought miners and their families to the village.

Following the Acts of Union 1800 between Ireland and the UK, better transport links were proposed between the two countries. Surveyors decided that the best route for a road (now the A5) between London and Holyhead should pass through the village. In 1815, Waterloo Bridge, built by Thomas Telford, opened to carry the Irish Mail road across the River Conwy and through the village. The establishment of the route brought an economic boost to the area as the village became a major mail coach stop between Corwen (to the east) and Capel Curig (to the west). It also led to improvement of the roads to Blaenau Ffestiniog and to Llanrwst and Conwy.

In 1868 Betws-y-Coed railway station opened with the extension of the Conwy Valley line from Llanrwst. The railway was later further extended to serve the mineral industries in Blaenau Ffestiniog. With the arrival of the railway from Llandudno Junction railway station, the village&#x27;s population increased by around 500 people.

==Places of worship==

Church of St Mary is an active Anglican parish church of the Church in Wales, in the deanery of Arllechwedd, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the diocese of Bangor. It is designated by Cadw as a Grade II* listed building.

The Anglican church was constructed to accommodate increasing numbers of summer visitors to the area. It replaced the earlier 14th century St Michael&#x27;s Old Church, from which the village took its name &quot;Betws&quot;. The building, which cost £5,000 (equivalent to £ in )., was designed by the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin. The principal benefactor was the Liverpool businessman Charles Kurtz. Work began on the village&#x27;s former cockpit and fairground in 1870.

The church was consecrated in July 1873. Interior features include a wooden cross-beamed roof with walls and floors made from various types of stone, such as local bluestone, sandstone (floor tiles) from Ancaster, and black serpentine from Cornwall. There is seating for a congregation of 150 people.

The square bell tower was completed in 1907. An integrated church hall was added in the 1970s; its commemorative stone was laid by the Earl of Ancaster in 1976.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Betws-y-Coed, at community and county borough level: Betws-y-Coed Community Council and Conwy County Borough Council. The community council meets at the Memorial Hall on Mill Street (Pentre Felin).

The community, including the village itself and its immediate neighbourhood, has a population of 564. An electoral ward of the name Betws-y-Coed also exists. This ward includes a large additional area including two neighbouring communities Capel Curig and Dolwyddelan and has a total population of 1,244. The ward elects a county councillor to Conwy County Borough Council.

===Administrative history===
Betws-y-Coed was an ancient parish in the historic county of Caernarfonshire. When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894 it was given a parish council and included in the Bettws-y-Coed Rural District, which covered the Caernarfonshire parishes from the Llanrwst poor law union. The parish was converted into an urban district in 1898.

The official spelling was &quot;Bettws-y-Coed&quot; until 1950, when the urban district council changed it to &quot;Betws-y-Coed&quot;, to respect modern Welsh orthography. The General Post Office adopted the same spelling as the council three years later in 1953.

Betws-y-Coed Urban District was abolished in 1974, with the area instead becoming a community. District-level functions passed to Aberconwy Borough Council, which in turn was replaced in 1996 by Conwy County Borough Council.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Betws-y-Coed railway station is a stop on the Conwy Valley line, with passenger services running approximately every three hours each way between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno. Services are operated by Transport for Wales.

The station buildings were constructed from local materials by local builder Owen Gethin Jones. The station had double platforms and an extensive goods yard. In LMS timetables, the station was listed as &quot;Betws-y-Coed for Capel Curig&quot;. 

The Conwy Valley Railway Museum, with its extensive miniature railway, now occupies the former goods yard.

===Buses===
Local bus services are operated predominately by Llew Jones Coaches and Gwynfor Coaches. Routes connect the town with Llandudno, Llanberis, Llanrwst and Caernarfon.

===Road===
Since the opening of the A5 in the early 19th century, the village has been a primary destination for road signage in Snowdonia.

==Tourism==

The village is a centre for outdoor activities and lies within the Gwydyr Forest. 

The current Betws-y-Coed Golf Club was founded in the 1970s. There was an earlier club and course located on or near the Recreation Ground. 

The Llyn Elsi reservoir nearby is used by walkers and anglers, and provides water for the village. Footpaths provide access to the lake, both from Betws-y-Coed itself and the outlying village of Pentre Du. 

Conwy Valley Railway Museum, with its miniature railway, lies next to the railway station.

==Music==
Melys, an independent rock band, was founded in Betws-y-Coed in 1997. The group, who sing in both English and Welsh, have recorded eleven sessions for John Peel on BBC Radio 1 and came first in his &quot;Festive Fifty&quot; in 2001. They won &quot;Best Welsh-language Act&quot; at the Welsh Music Awards in 2002.

<text>Bethesda (; ) is a town and community in Gwynedd, Wales. It is on the banks of Afon Ogwen and on the edge of Snowdonia. It is about south-west of Bangor. It is a predominantly Welsh-speaking town.

== History ==
The settlement&#x27;s ancient name was Cilfoden, formerly known as Glanogwen. In 1820 the Bethesda Independent Chapel was built and the town subsequently grew around and later named after it. The chapel was enlarged in 1840.

The town grew around the slate quarrying industries; the largest of the local quarries is the Penrhyn Quarry. At its peak, the town exported purple slate all over the world. Penrhyn Quarry suffered a three-year strike led by the North Wales Quarrymen&#x27;s Union between 1900 and 1903 – the longest industrial dispute in British history. This led to the building of a street of houses in the nearby village of Tregarth, by the quarry owners, to house the families of those workers who opted not to strike. It also led to the formation of three co-operative quarries, the largest of which Pantdreiniog dominated the town for many years.

The A5 road runs through Bethesda and marked the border between Lord Penrhyn&#x27;s land, and the freehold land. Most of the town is to the east and northeast of the road, with housing packed onto the hillside in irregular rows, built on the commons. On the current high street, all the public houses are found on the south side of the road.

=== Railways ===
The narrow gauge Penrhyn Quarry Railway opened in 1801 to serve Penrhyn Quarry. It connected the quarry with Port Penrhyn on the coast and operated until 1962. In 1884, a branch of the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s network from Bangor was opened, along with a station for the town. The line closed to passengers in 1951 and to freight in 1963.

The trackbed of the Penrhyn Quarry Railway towards Porth Penrhyn is taken over by the Lôn Las Ogwen cycle path.

== Modern Bethesda ==
The population of Bethesda was 4,735 in 2011. Current opportunities for employment in the town are limited: there are a few manufacturing businesses; most businesses are in the low-paid service sector and hospitality industry. 

Ysgol Dyffryn Ogwen (&quot;Ogwen Valley School&quot;) is a bilingual comprehensive school, with 374 pupils, established in 1951.

Zip World Velocity in Penrhyn Quarry is the longest zipline in Europe, at just over long, and brings the town hundreds of visitors.

== Governance ==
There are two tiers of local government covering Bethesda, at community and county level, with both councils using Welsh as their primary language: Cyngor Cymuned Bethesda (Bethesda Community Council) and Cyngor Gwynedd (Gwynedd Council). The community council has its offices at 26 Stryd Fawr (High Street) and meets at Canolfan Cefnfaes, a former school on Mostyn Terrace, now converted into a community facility.

===Administrative history===
Bethesda was historically part of the parish of Llanllechid. The nascent town grew rapidly from the 1820s with the development of the local quarries. By the 1850s it was clear that the area needed more formal structures of local government, particularly to supply water and sewers, maintain the streets, and regulate the town&#x27;s further development. A body of improvement commissioners was therefore established in 1854.

Improvement commissioners&#x27; districts such as Bethesda were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so a parish of Bethesda was created from the part of Llanllechid parish within the urban district.

Bethesda Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Bethesda was created instead, covering the area of the abolished urban district. District-level functions passed to Arfon Borough Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Gwynedd Council.

== Architecture ==

The architecture and layout of the town are largely utilitarian. Most of the buildings are constructed of stone with slate roofs. Some are constructed wholly of slate blocks, although such buildings tend to suffer from damp and structural slippage because the very flat and smooth surfaces of slate do not bind well to mortar.

The town has 40 Grade II listed buildings, including three pubs, in addition to the substantial and imposing Grade I listed Nonconformist Jerusalem Chapel

The upper parts of Carneddi, Cilfodan and Tan y Foel owe more to stone quarrying on the nearby hills rather than slate quarrying that supported the lower end of the town. At the eastern limits, the town is bounded by the rising land of the Carneddau mountains which form some of the more remote landscapes of Snowdonia. Much of Bethesda once consisted of discrete villages such as Gerlan, Rachub, Tregarth, Llanllechid and Braichmelyn; their names are retained as districts of the town.

== Religion ==
Bethesda is noted for both the number of chapels (mostly dating from the 1904-1905 Welsh Revival) in the town. The town was named after the Bethesda Chapel, which was recently converted into residential flats.

== Commerce and industry ==
Llanllechid, on the outskirts of Bethesda, is the home of the Popty Bakery, the origins of which date back to the bakery opened by O. J. Williams in the early 1900s. The product range highlights Welsh cuisine, including Welsh cakes and Bara Brith.

== Language and culture ==
The dominant language of the town is Welsh and can be seen written and heard spoken in most settings. According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, 77.5% of the residents are Welsh-speaking (with some parts being over 80.0%+), higher than the average for both Gwynedd and Wales as a whole. In successive census returns (1901 and 1911) Bethesda had the highest percentage of Welsh speakers of its respective shire (Caernarfonshire) and of any district in Wales (with 1,500 monolingual Welsh speakers in 1901). The name of the town is known colloquially &quot;Pesda&quot; in the local Welsh dialect.

The S4C series &quot;Amdani!&quot; (a play on words that can mean &quot;go for it!&quot; and &quot;about her&quot;) was based on a fictitious women&#x27;s rugby team in Bethesda, and many of the location shots were filmed in the area. The series was based on the novel of the same name, by Bethan Gwanas, who lived in the town.

In June 2012 Tabernacl (Bethesda) Cyf., a non-profit co-operative based in the town was awarded a grant of around £1 million to renovate Neuadd Ogwen, a performance venue on the High Street. It was due to reopen as a community arts centre in June 2013.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Bethesda developed a reputation as a hub of musical creativity. Jam sessions and small home studios abounded alongside a burgeoning pub rock scene. As well as the now well-established &#x27;Pesda Roc&#x27; festival, Bethesda has nurtured the Welsh language bands &quot;Celt&quot;, &quot;Maffia Mr Huws&quot; and experimentalists &quot;Y Jeycsyn Ffeif&quot;. In more recent years it continues to spring up bands from the local community such as &quot;Radio Rhydd&quot;.

<doc id="619980" wikidata="Q849599" url="?curid=619980" title="Thermocline">
<text>A thermocline (also known as the thermal layer or the metalimnion in lakes) is
a distinct layer based on temperature within a large body of fluid (e.g. water, as in an ocean or lake; or air, e.g. an atmosphere) with a high gradient of distinct temperature differences associated with depth. In the ocean, the thermocline divides the upper mixed layer from the calm deep water below.

Depending largely on season, latitude, and turbulent mixing by wind, thermoclines may be a semi-permanent feature of the body of water in which they occur, or they may form temporarily in response to phenomena such as the radiative heating/cooling of surface water during the day/night. Factors that affect the depth and thickness of a thermocline include seasonal weather variations, latitude, and local environmental conditions, such as tides and currents.

==Oceans==


Most of the heat energy of the sunlight that strikes the Earth is absorbed in the first few centimeters at the ocean&#x27;s surface, which heats during the day and cools at night as heat energy is lost to space by radiation. Waves mix the water near the surface layer and distribute heat to deeper water such that the temperature may be relatively uniform in the upper , depending on wave strength and the existence of surface turbulence caused by currents. Below this mixed layer, the temperature remains relatively stable over day/night cycles. The temperature of the deep ocean drops gradually with depth. As saline water does not freeze until it reaches (colder as depth and pressure increase) the temperature well below the surface is usually not far from zero degrees.

The thermocline varies in depth. It is semi-permanent in the tropics, variable in temperate regions and shallow to nonexistent in the polar regions, where the water column is cold from the surface to the bottom. A layer of sea ice will act as an insulation blanket. The first accurate global measurements were made during the oceanographic expedition of HMS Challenger.

In the open ocean, the thermocline is characterized by a negative sound speed gradient, making the thermocline important in submarine warfare because it can reflect active sonar and other acoustic signals. This stems from a discontinuity in the acoustic impedance of water created by the sudden change in density.

In scuba diving, a thermocline where water drops in temperature by a few degrees Celsius quite suddenly can sometimes be observed between two bodies of water, for example where colder upwelling water runs into a surface layer of warmer water. It gives the water an appearance of wrinkled glass, the kind often used in bathroom windows to obscure the view, and is caused by the altered refractive index of the cold or warm water column. These same schlieren can be observed when hot air rises off the tarmac at airports or desert roads and is the cause of mirages.

==Thermocline seasonality==
The thermocline in the ocean can vary in depth and strength seasonally. This is particularly noticeable in mid-latitudes with a thicker mixed layer in the winter and thinner mixed layer in summer. The cooler winter temperatures cause the thermocline to drop to further depths and warmed summer temperatures bring the thermocline back to the upper layer. In areas around the tropics and subtropics, the thermocline may become even thinner in the summer than in other locations. At higher latitudes, around the poles, there is more of a seasonal thermocline than a permanent one with warmer surface waters. This is where there is a dichothermal layer instead.

In the Northern hemisphere, the maximum temperatures at the surface occur through August and September and minimum temperatures occur through February and March with total heat content being lowest in March. This is when the seasonal thermocline starts to build back up after being broken down through the colder months.

A permanent thermocline is one that is not affected by season and lies below the yearly mixed layer maximum depth.

==Other water bodies==
Thermoclines can also be observed in lakes. In colder climates, this leads to a phenomenon called stratification. During the summer, warm water, which is less dense, will sit on top of colder, denser, deeper water with a thermocline separating them. The warm layer is called the epilimnion and the cold layer is called the hypolimnion. Because the warm water is exposed to the sun during the day, a stable system exists and very little mixing of warm water and cold water occurs, particularly in calm weather.


One result of this stability is that as the summer wears on, there is less and less oxygen below the thermocline as the water below the thermocline never circulates to the surface and organisms in the water deplete the available oxygen. As winter approaches, the temperature of the surface water will drop as nighttime cooling dominates heat transfer. A point is reached where the density of the cooling surface water becomes greater than the density of the deep water and overturning begins as the dense surface water moves down under the influence of gravity. This process is aided by wind or any other process (currents for example) that agitates the water. This effect also occurs in Arctic and Antarctic waters, bringing water to the surface which, although low in oxygen, is higher in nutrients than the original surface water. This enriching of surface nutrients may produce blooms of phytoplankton, making these areas productive.

As the temperature continues to drop, the water on the surface may get cold enough to freeze and the lake/ocean begins to ice over. A new thermocline develops where the densest water () sinks to the bottom, and the less dense water (water that is approaching the freezing point) rises to the top. Once this new stratification establishes itself, it lasts until the water warms enough for the &#x27;spring turnover,&#x27; which occurs after the ice melts and the surface water temperature rises to 4 °C. During this transition, a thermal bar may develop.

Waves can occur on the thermocline, causing the depth of the thermocline as measured at a single location to oscillate (usually as a form of seiche). Alternately, the waves may be induced by flow over a raised bottom, producing a thermocline wave which does not change with time, but varies in depth as one moves into or against the flow.

==Atmosphere==

The thermal boundary between the troposphere (lower atmosphere) and the stratosphere (upper atmosphere) is a thermocline. Temperature generally decreases with altitude, but the heat from the day&#x27;s exposure to sun is released at night, which can create a warm region at ground with colder air above. This is known as an inversion (a further example of a thermocline). At sunrise, the sun&#x27;s energy warms the ground, causing the warming air to rise, thus destabilizing and eventually reversing the inversion layer. 
This phenomenon was first applied to the field of noise pollution study in the 1960s, contributing to the design of urban highways and noise barriers.

<doc id="619984" wikidata="Q1046363" url="?curid=619984" title="Surface layer">
<text>The surface layer is the layer of a turbulent fluid most affected by interaction with a solid surface or the surface separating a gas and a liquid where the characteristics of the turbulence depend on distance from the interface. Surface layers are characterized by large normal gradients of tangential velocity and large concentration gradients of any substances (temperature, moisture, sediments et cetera) transported to or from the interface.

The term [[boundary layer]] is used in meteorology and physical oceanography. The atmospheric surface layer is the lowest part of the atmospheric boundary layer (typically the bottom 10% where the log wind profile is valid). The ocean has two surface layers: the benthic, found immediately above the sea floor, and the marine surface layer, at the air-sea interface.

==Mathematical formulation==
A simple model of the surface layer can be derived by first examining the turbulent momentum flux through a surface.
Using Reynolds decomposition to express the horizontal flow in the formula_1 direction as the sum of a slowly varying component, formula_2, and a turbulent component, formula_3,

:formula_4 

and the vertical flow, formula_5, in an analogous fashion,

:formula_6

we can express the flux of turbulent momentum through a surface, formula_7, as the time-averaged magnitude of vertical turbulent transport of horizontal turbulent momentum, formula_8:

:formula_9.

If the flow is homogeneous within the region, we can set the product of the vertical gradient of the mean horizontal flow and the eddy viscosity coefficient formula_10 equal to formula_11:

:formula_12,

where formula_10 is defined in terms of Prandtl&#x27;s mixing length hypothesis:

:formula_14

where formula_15 is the mixing length.

We can then express formula_7 as:

:formula_17.

==Assumptions about the mixing length==
From the figure above, we can see that the size of a turbulent eddy near the surface is constrained by its proximity to the surface; turbulent eddies centered near the surface cannot be as large as those centered further from the surface. From this consideration, and in neutral conditions, it is reasonable to assume that the mixing length, formula_15 is proportional to the eddy&#x27;s depth in the surface:

:formula_19,

where formula_20 is the depth and formula_21 is known as the von Kármán constant. Thus the gradient can be integrated to solve for formula_2:

:formula_23.

So, we see that the mean flow in the surface layer has a logarithmic relationship with depth. In non-neutral conditions the mixing length is also affected by buoyancy forces and Monin-Obukhov similarity theory is required to describe the horizontal-wind profile.

==Surface layer in oceanography==
The surface layer is studied in oceanography, as both the wind stress and action of surface waves can cause turbulent mixing necessary for the formation of a surface layer.

The world&#x27;s oceans are made up of many different water masses. Each have particular temperature and salinity characteristics as a result of the location in which they formed. Once formed at a particular source, a water mass will travel some distance via large-scale ocean circulation. Typically, the flow of water in the ocean is described as turbulent (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t follow straight lines). Water masses can travel across the ocean as turbulent eddies, or parcels of water usually along constant density (isopycnic) surfaces where the expenditure of energy is smallest. When these turbulent eddies of different water masses interact, they will mix together. With enough mixing, some stable equilibrium is reached and a mixed layer is formed. Turbulent eddies can also be produced from wind stress by the atmosphere on the ocean. This kind of interaction and mixing through buoyancy at the surface of the ocean also plays a role in the formation of a surface mixed layer.

===Discrepancies with traditional theory===
The logarithmic flow profile has long been observed in the ocean, but recent, highly sensitive measurements reveal a sublayer within the surface layer in which turbulent eddies are enhanced by the action of surface waves.
It is becoming clear that the surface layer of the ocean is only poorly modeled as being up against the &quot;wall&quot; of the air-sea interaction.
Observations of turbulence in Lake Ontario reveal under wave-breaking conditions the traditional theory significantly underestimates the production of turbulent kinetic energy within the surface layer.

===Diurnal cycle===
The depth of the surface mixed layer is affected by solar insolation and thus is related to the diurnal cycle. After nighttime convection over the ocean, the turbulent surface layer is found to completely decay and restratify. The decay is caused by the decrease in solar insolation, divergence of turbulent flux and relaxation of lateral gradients.
During the nighttime, the surface ocean cools because the atmospheric circulation is reduced due to the change in heat with the setting of the sun each day. Cooler water is less buoyant and will sink. This buoyancy effect causes water masses to be transported to lower depths even lower those reached during daytime. During the following daytime, water at depth is restratified or un-mixed because of the warming of the sea surface and buoyancy driving the warmed water upward. The entire cycle will be repeated and the water will be mixed during the following nighttime.

In general, the surface mixed layer only occupies the first 100 meters of the ocean but can reach 150 m in the end of winter. The diurnal cycle does not change the depth of the mixed layer significantly relative to the seasonal cycle which produces much larger changes in sea surface temperature and buoyancy. With several vertical profiles, one can estimate the depth of the mixed layer by assigning a set temperature or density difference in water between surface and deep ocean observations – this is known as the “threshold method”.

However, this diurnal cycle does not have the same effect in midlatitudes as it does at tropical latitudes. Tropical regions are less likely than midlatitude regions to have a mixed layer dependent on diurnal temperature changes. One study explored diurnal variability of the mixed layer depth in the Western Equatorial Pacific Ocean. Results suggested no appreciable change in the mixed layer depth with the time of day. The significant precipitation in this tropical area would lead to further stratification of the mixed layer. Another study which instead focused on the Central Equatorial Pacific Ocean found a tendency for increased depths of the mixed layer during nighttime. The extratropical or midlatitude mixed layer was shown in one study to be more affected by diurnal variability than the results of the two tropical ocean studies. Over a 15-day study period in Australia, the diurnal mixed layer cycle repeated in a consistent manner with decaying turbulence throughout the day.

<doc id="619985" wikidata="Q2655856" url="?curid=619985" title="Menai Bridge">
<text>Menai Bridge (; usually referred to colloquially as &quot;Y Borth&quot;) is a town and community on the Isle of Anglesey in north-west Wales. It overlooks the Menai Strait and lies by the Menai Suspension Bridge, built in 1826 by Thomas Telford, just over the water from Bangor. It has a population of 3,376. 

There are many small islands near the town, including Church Island. The Menai Heritage Bridges Exhibition celebrates the Menai Suspension Bridge, built by Thomas Telford, and the Britannia Bridge, built by Robert Stephenson.

==Description and attractions==
At the eastern edge of the town is &quot;Cwm Cadnant&quot; Dingle which is now by-passed by a modern bridge constructed in the 1970s. The Afon Cadnant drains into the Menai Strait at this point and this small estuary provides a natural haven for small boats crossing from the mainland. This was the location of the landing stage for the Bishops of Bangor who had their residence at Glyn Garth on Anglesey but whose cathedral was in Bangor on the mainland.

There are a number of small islands in the Menai Strait some of which are connected to the town by causeways, including &quot;Ynys Faelog&quot;, Ynys Gaint, Ynys Castell and Ynys y Bîg east of the suspension bridge and Church Island (&quot;Ynys Tysilio&quot; in Welsh) west of the bridge. The Isle of Anglesey Coastal Path passes along the waterfront.

Menai Bridge has several churches and chapels, including an English and Welsh Presbyterian church and a Catholic church. The town also has a primary school, Ysgol y Borth, and a large bilingual comprehensive school, Ysgol David Hughes.

Menai Bridge is home to the School of Ocean Sciences, part of Bangor University. Their research ship, the Prince Madog, is based at the pier when not at sea.

Attractions in Menai Bridge include the 14th-century Church of St Tysilio, St George&#x27;s Pier, a butterfly house, Pili Palas, and the Plas Cadnant Hidden Gardens, a 200-acre (80 hectare) estate originally developed as a picturesque garden in the 1800s. The garden had been the site of restoration for twenty years. In December 2015, heavy rains caused flooding which washed away rare plants representing twenty years of work by Anthony Tavernor. Tavernor received some help to restore the garden, enabling him and his small staff to begin rebuilding and replanting the garden. The garden was able to reopen by Easter, 2016.

==Listed buildings==
There are over 30 buildings listed by Cadw of being of special importance. These include the suspension bridge itself, St. Mary&#x27;s Church, the church of St. Tysilio, the Victoria Hotel, and the War memorial on Church Island and several individual houses and buildings

==Glyn Garth ==
Menai Bridge includes the development along Beaumaris Road known as Glyn Garth. This was a favoured location for holiday houses for the wealthy from the Manchester and Liverpool areas in the late 19th century, and many large houses of that period remain. This was also where the Bishop of Bangor had his palace. The palace was demolished in the early 1960s and replaced by a block of flats, Glyn Garth Court, completed in 1966.

==History==
The town existed as &quot;Porthaethwy&quot; for centuries and still has a house which dates from the 17th century. The name derives from &quot;Porth&quot; (harbour) + &quot;Daethwy&quot; (the name of a local Celtic tribe and later of a local medieval commote). It is likely that a community existed here in Roman times as it is the shortest crossing of the Menai Strait.

In the 9th century, St Tysilio lived here as a hermit on Church Island.

A ferry across the Menai was first recorded in 1292. When the bridge opened in 1826, the ferry closed, but connections with the sea remained through the import, export and shipbuilding trades.

Lewis Carroll&#x27;s &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; (1872) mentions the Menai Bridge in chapter 8 in a nonsense song.

From 1877 to 1920, the ship HMS &quot;Clio&quot; was docked at Menai Bridge; it was lent to the North Wales Society to teach young men the ways of seafaring. Many local people believed the ship was used for some type of prison, but this was not entirely true. The ship was home to young men who were in need of discipline to keep them from getting into serious trouble; some were sent to the Clio against their will. The young men on the &quot;Clio&quot; were not permitted to leave the ship; some of the corporal punishment administered was cruel. Stories about life on the &quot;Clio&quot; were commonplace among the residents of Menai Bridge; for many years, some mothers threatened their misbehaving children with being sent to live on the ship.

On 12 November 1918, Major Thomas Elmhirst (later Air Marshal Sir Thomas Elmhirst), commanding officer of RNAS Anglesey, flew airship SSZ73 under the Menai Bridge following the armistice at the end of World War I.

===Carreg yr Halen===
Carreg yr Halen is a small tidal island in the Menai Strait. Its centre lies approximately 20 metres offshore from the Belgian Promenade just upstream of the suspension bridge. Only the rocky tip of the island is visible at high spring tide but at low tide area of rock, sand and some seaweed are exposed which provides feeding ground for a variety of wading birds including oystercatcher, redshank, and curlew.

It is the site of one of the many ferry crossings of the Menai Strait which were in use prior to the construction of the suspension bridge in 1826 

In 1914, Belgian refugees from Mechelen, who had settled in the area, built a promenade (the &quot;Belgian promenade&quot;) out of gratitude for the town&#x27;s hospitality. The promenade was built along the Menai Strait from Ynys Tysilio (Church Island) to Carreg yr Halen and was completed in 1916. It was rebuilt in 1963. The ceremonial reopening in 1965 was performed by the only surviving refugee, Eduard Wilhelms. Most of the refugees lived at three houses in Menai Bridge, with 12 housed at the Village Hall in Llandegfan. Most of the men were skilled in marquetry.

A special celebration was held in 2014 at Menai Bridge to celebrate to centenary of the construction of the promenade.

==TV location==
Welsh-language production company, Rondo Media, has converted a disused garage into a fake row of shops in the centre of Menai Bridge as a film set for the soap opera &quot;Rownd a Rownd&quot;, shown on the Welsh-language channel S4C. They also film the show in schools in the town, Ysgol y Borth, and around the town itself.

==Fair==
The large car park to the north of the High Street is the &quot;fair field&quot;. This is a piece of common land set aside for the holding of an annual fair called Ffair Borth, a tradition dating back to 1691. It started as a horse fair, and livestock trading was carried out until the 1970s. It was also a hiring fair. It was one of the year&#x27;s great occasions for the folk of Anglesey and Arfon. The fair now features traditional fair rides. It comes to Menai Bridge on 24 October every year, unless it falls on a Sunday, in which case it is held on either 23 or 25 October. The fair stalls also take over most of the roads and streets in the town, making passage through the town very difficult.

A traditional verse goes: 
==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Menai Bridge, at community (town) and county level: Menai Bridge Town Council and Isle of Anglesey County Council. The town council is based at Canolfan Coed Cyrnol on Mona Road.

===Administrative history===

The community of Menai Bridge corresponds to the ancient parish of Llandysilio, which had its parish church at St Tysilio&#x27;s Church on Church Island.

In 1884 the parish was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. Although its area was defined as the parish of Llandysilio, the local government district took the name Menai Bridge. The local board also took over the functions of the Llandysilio improvement commissioners, which had been established in 1879 to manage certain areas of former common land in the parish. Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894.

Menai Bridge Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area instead becoming a community called Menai Bridge. District-level functions passed to Ynys Môn-Isle of Anglesey Borough Council, which in 1996 was reconstituted as a county council.

<text>Bert Sakmann (; born 12 June 1942) is a German cell physiologist. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Erwin Neher in 1991 for their work on &quot;the function of single ion channels in cells,&quot; and the invention of the patch clamp. Bert Sakmann was Professor at Heidelberg University and is an Emeritus Scientific Member of the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg, Germany. Since 2008 he leads an emeritus research group at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology.

==Life and career==
Sakmann was born in Stuttgart, the son of Annemarie (née Schaefer), a physical therapist, and Bertold Sakmann, a theater director. Sakmann enrolled in Volksschule in Lindau, and completed the Wagenburg gymnasium in Stuttgart in 1961. He studied medicine from 1967 onwards in Tübingen, Freiburg, Berlin, Paris and Munich. After completing his medical exams at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, he became a medical assistant in 1968 at Munich University, while also working as a scientific assistant (Wissenschaftlicher Assistent) at Munich&#x27;s Max-Planck-Institut für Psychiatrie, in the Neurophysiology Department under Otto Detlev Creutzfeldt. In 1971 he moved to University College London, where he worked in the Department of Biophysics under Bernard Katz. In 1974, he completed his medical dissertation, under the title &quot;Elektrophysiologie der neuralen Helladaptation in der Katzenretina&quot; (&quot;Electrophysiology of Neural Light Adaption in the Cat Retina&quot;) in the Medical Faculty of Göttingen University.

Afterwards (still in 1974), Sakmann returned to the lab of Otto Creutzfeldt, who had meanwhile moved to the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Göttingen. Sakmann joined the membrane biology group in 1979.

In 1990 he accepted a position at the Faculty of Natural Science Medicine at Heidelberg University. One year later, he became a full university professor at the Faculty of Biology in Heidelberg.

On 2 June 2009, Peter Gruss, the president of the Max Planck Society, announced that Sakmann would serve as the scientific director of the Max Planck Florida Institute, the organization&#x27;s biomedical research facility at Florida Atlantic University in Jupiter, Florida.

Sakmann is the founder of the Bert-Sakmann-Stiftung.

==Awards and honors==
In 1986, Sakmann and Erwin Neher were awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University. In 1987, he received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 1991, he received the Ralph W. Gerard Prize in Neuroscience, the Harvey Prize and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine along with Neher, with whom he had worked in Göttingen. In 1993 he became a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1994.

<doc id="619990" wikidata="Q2233618" url="?curid=619990" title="Llanrwst">
<text>; ) is a market town and community on the A470 road and the River Conwy, in Conwy County Borough, Wales, and the historic county of Denbighshire. It developed around the wool trade and became known also for the making of harps and clocks. Today, less than from the edge of Snowdonia, its main pursuit is tourism. Notable buildings include almshouses, two 17th-century chapels, and the Parish Church of St Grwst, which holds the stone coffin of Llywelyn the Great. The 2011 census gave it a population of 3,323.

==History==
The site of the original church dedicated to Saint Grwst was Cae Llan in Llanrwst, on a site now occupied by Seion Methodist Chapel. The current church of St Grwst is on land which was donated in about 1170 by Rhun ap Nefydd Hardd, a member of the royal family of Gwynedd, specifically to build a new church so dedicated.

Llanrwst developed around the wool trade, and for a long time the price of wool for the whole of Britain was set here. The growth of the village in the 13th century was considerably aided by an edict by Edward I of England (who built Conwy Castle) prohibiting any Welshman from trading within of the town of Conwy. Llanrwst, located some from that town, was strategically placed to benefit from this.

In 1276, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, seized the town, declaring it the Free Borough of Llanrwst independent of the diocese of Llanelwy. This the bishop contested, but the borough kept its freedom for the lifetime of Llywelyn and later through efforts by Aberconwy Abbey, which tore down banners relating to the bishopric or to Edward I. A century later, after the monastery moved to Maenan Abbey, the town had its own coat of arms and flag, the origin of the local motto &quot;Cymru, Lloegr a Llanrwst&quot; (Wales, England and Llanrwst). This motto, a testament to this apparent independence, has now become synonymous with the song of that title by a local band, Y Cyrff. When the Llanrwst Almshouses &amp; Museum Trust closed in 2011, it returned to the community the 12th-century Llanrwst flag, as an emblem central to the town&#x27;s belief in its independence.

In 1610 Sir John Wynn of Gwydir had the historic Llanrwst Almshouses built to house poor people of the parish. These closed in 1976, but were restored in 1996 with the aid of Heritage Lottery funding, reopening as a museum of local history and community focal point. It held a collection of over 100 items relating largely to the rural Conwy valley, and a number associated with the renowned Llanrwst Bards of the late 19th century. It closed as a museum in 2011, but reopened in 2013 as the new council chamber.

The Grade I-listed Pont Fawr, a narrow, three-arched stone bridge said to have been designed by Inigo Jones, was built in 1636 by Sir Richard Wynn (son of Sir John Wynn) of Gwydir Castle. It links the town with Gwydir, a manor house dating from 1492, a 15th-century courthouse known as Tu Hwnt i&#x27;r Bont, and a road from nearby Trefriw. North of the village is the site of a house, Plas Madoc, which was the home of Colonel John Higson. A friend of Henry Pochin of Bodnant, Higson developed a garden at Plas Madoc which may have had input from, or been influenced by, Henry Ernest Milner. The house has been demolished but the garden remain and are listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

In 1947, Llanrwst Town Council allegedly sought in vain for a seat on the United Nations Security Council as an independent state within Wales. This is not confirmed in the United Nations Security Council minutes available online.

Llanrwst hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1951, 1989 and 2019.
==Geography==
Llanrwst lies between above sea level on the eastern bank of the River Conwy. The A470 trunk route between North and South Wales runs through the town, joined by the A548 main road from Rhyl, Prestatyn and Chester. To the south-west is Gwydir Forest. On the hills above is Moel Maelogan wind farm; the power generated by its turbines is fed to the town sub-station.

In 1830 the local doctor and naturalist John Williams published a work &quot;Faunula Grustensis&quot; (&#x27;Crusty Plants&#x27;) which described the fauna, geography and pathologies in and around Llanrwst.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Llanrwst, at community (town) and county borough level: Llanrwst Town Council and Conwy County Borough Council.

Llanrwst was the name of the electoral ward to Gwynedd County Council between 1973 and 1996, electing one county councillor.

Llanrwst now divides into two such wards, Gower and Crwst, each sending a councillor to Conwy County Borough Council. In 2017, Plaid Cymru&#x27;s Aaron Wynne was elected to the Crwst ward at the age of 20 years, making him Wales&#x27;s youngest county councillor and Conwy County Borough Council&#x27;s youngest ever elected member. The town also elects members to Llanrwst Town Council.

===Administrative history===
Llanrwst was an ancient parish in the historic county of Denbighshire. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894 it was given a parish council and included in the Llanrwst Rural District. In 1897 part of the parish was converted into an urban district. Llanrwst Urban District was abolished in 1974 and its area became a community instead. District-level functions passed to Aberconwy Borough Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Conwy County Borough Council.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census the town population was put at 3,323, 61 per cent being Welsh speakers. At one time Llanrwst was the Wales&#x27;s eighth largest town, with a higher population than Cardiff.&lt;ref name=&quot;VOB - Llanrwst CP/AP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The change in the town population in the 19th and 20th centuries appears in the chart below.
==Transport==
Llanrwst has two railway stations, Llanrwst and North Llanrwst, on the Conwy Valley Line, which terminated here before being extended to Betws-y-Coed in 1867 and Blaenau Ffestiniog in 1879. It was originally envisaged that the railway would pass closer to the river, on the site of today&#x27;s Central Garage. The Victoria Hotel was built opposite the bridge in anticipation of this. Had the line been built on the west bank of the River Conwy, as originally planned, to serve the inland port of Trefriw across the river from Llanrwst, it is unlikely that Llanrwst would have gained its present status.

==Education==
Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy, previously Llanrwst Grammar School, is a bilingual secondary school with about 790 pupils. According to the latest inspection report by Estyn, it has a GCSE pass rate of 71 per cent (based on five GCSEs, grades A–C), putting the school in equal 24th place, just outside the top 10 per cent of secondary schools in Wales. It is also the second best-performing secondary school in Conwy, behind Eirias High School in Colwyn Bay.

<doc id="619994" wikidata="Q3757704" url="?curid=619994" title="Ffestiniog">
<text>Ffestiniog (; ) is a community in Gwynedd, Wales, containing several villages, in particular the settlements of Llan Ffestiniog and Blaenau Ffestiniog. It has a population of 4,875.

==History==

Ffestiniog was a parish in Cantref Ardudwy; in 1284, Ardudwy became part of the county of Merionethshire, which became an administrative county in 1888.
Mary Evans (1735–89) founded a sect in Ffestiniog around 1780, whose believers held that she had married Christ in a ceremony held in Ffestiniog church. The sect soon died out after her death. 
The parish was created an urban district in 1894. On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, &quot;Ffestiniog Urban District&quot; was abolished, becoming merged with other districts to form Meirionnydd District, which was itself abolished in 1996. Ffestiniog became a community with an elected town council.

Ffestiniog Golf Club was founded in 1893. The club closed at the end of March 2014.

== Toponymy ==
Celtic place-name in &quot;*-ākon&quot; &quot;place of&quot;, then, &quot;place belonging to, territory of&quot; &gt; Old Welsh &quot;-auc, -awg&quot; &gt; Welsh &quot;-og&quot;. The form &quot;-iog&quot; with an additional /i/ can be explained by the preceding element, which is a personal name ending with &quot;-i-us&quot; : &quot;Festinius&quot;. The whole name should be &quot;*Festiniākon&quot;. Probably same name as Festigny (France, e.g.: Festigny, Marne, &quot;Festiniacus&quot; in 853). A Roman Inscription in Chester honours Lucius Festinius Probus; Chester was the main Roman base for North Wales, so this is probably he.

<doc id="619996" wikidata="Q711015" url="?curid=619996" title="Mike Vallely">
<text>Mike Vallely ( ; born 1970), also known as Mike V, is an American professional skateboarder and musician. Since November 2013, he has been the lead vocalist of the hardcore punk band Black Flag. Vallely is the second-longest-serving member of the band, although he has not appeared on any albums.

== Early life ==
Born in 1970, Vallely grew up in Edison, New Jersey. He has an older brother, Joe, and a younger sister, Amy. Growing up, Vallely played little league baseball, but, in 1984, aged 14, Vallely discovered skateboarding and punk music, borrowed a skateboard from a friend and proceeded to dedicate his life to skateboarding.

At Christmas in 1984, Vallely&#x27;s parents purchased a Jeff Phillips professional signature model skateboard for him. Besides street skating, Vallely also began vert skateboarding, and often skated at Tom Groholski&#x27;s ramp, as well as The Barn Ramp, both of which are located in New Jersey. Vallely also skated at the Brooklyn Banks, a well-known skateboarding location under New York&#x27;s Brooklyn Bridge.

In 1986, Vallely moved with his family to Virginia Beach, Virginia, for a brief period and, while living there, befriended some local skaters at Kempsville High School. Skating with a local team called &quot;Subculture&quot;, in the Kempsville area of Virginia Beach, Vallely tested his street skills in local contests, as well as on neighborhood quarter-pipe and launch ramps. In the spring of 1986, the Virginia Beach Skate park, Mount Trashmore, hosted a professional vert skateboard contest. Vallely and his friend began skating in the car park, adjacent to the vert ramp, during practice, and drew the attention of professional skateboarder, Neil Blender, from atop the ramp. Lance Mountain and Stacy Peralta, both of Powell Peralta and the Bones Brigade, were also impressed with Vallely. Seeing Vallely skate on a worn board, Mountain provided him with a brand new skateboard. Following the impromptu demo, Peralta offered Vallely an amateur sponsorship deal with Powell-Peralta Skateboards.

== Professional skateboarding ==

&quot;Thrasher Magazine&quot; photographed Vallely performing in the handplant circle, one of the photographs appearing on the cover of magazine&#x27;s August 1986 issue. In July 1986, Vallely&#x27;s new sponsor flew him to California to compete at the &quot;Street Attack&quot; contest, in Oceanside, California. Vallely won the amateur division, which led to a full-page spread in &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot;&#x27;s September issue. Also in 1986, Vallely appeared in the third Powell-Peralta video, &quot;The Search for Animal Chin&quot;, which was released in 1987. Later that year, Vallely became a professional skateboarder at a vert contest in Toronto, Canada on May 31, 1987.

In 1988, Powell-Peralta released Vallely&#x27;s first professional signature model skateboard. Initially adorned with graphics of a large bug, which was later changed to a graphic that featured an elephant. In 1989, Vallely left Powell-Peralta, at which time the company was the largest skateboarding brand in the world. Following this departure, Vallely became involved with World Industries, a skater-run brand that was conceived of and launched with peers Steve Rocco, Jesse Martinez, and Rodney Mullen. World Industries created the second ever double-kick skateboard design (a skateboard deck with a kicktail at both ends). The first was the Vision Double Tail, which Vallely&#x27;s double kick was modeled after but with a mellower kick and shorter tail than nose which would become the industry standard. A Vallely signature board was used for the new design&#x27;s introduction into the retail market.

Vallely was a part of World Industries until early 1991, when he joined New Deal Skateboards, where he stayed until January 1992, before starting the short-lived TV Skateboards with friend and professional skateboarder Ed Templeton. Due to health concerns and financial setbacks, TV Skateboards folded later that year, and Vallely returned to the newly reformed Powell Skateboards in 1993, where he stayed until 1997. Vallely then briefly rode for Transit Skateboards, before joining Black Label Skateboards in 1998, a company that he rode for until 2002. Vallely appeared in the Black Label video &quot;Label Kills&quot;. Vallely founded Vallely Skateboards in 2002, after he left Black Label. Vallely Skateboards were distributed through Giant Distribution and eventually folded in 2003 due to poor growth.

From 2003 until 2010, Vallely rode for Element Skateboards, before leaving to start yet another company, By the Sword, with fellow skateboarder Jason Filipow. However, the company was short-lived, as Vallely joined the roster of a rejuvenated Powell Peralta Skateboards in late 2010 – his third time with Skate One Distribution – along with Airwalk Footwear and Bones Bearings. In mid-2011, Vallely joined Iron Fist Clothing, as well as Tork Trux as their first team rider, after noticing the company&#x27;s innovative assembly method; however, Vallely quickly left Tork. A press release from the Swedish skate shoe company, Servant Footwear, was published in February 2013, announcing that Vallely was the first American ambassador and team rider for the brand.

=== Elephant Brand ===
In late 2011, Vallely again resigned from Powell-Peralta and founded Elephant Skateboards in December 2011. In April 2012, Jason Adams – formerly of Black Label and Enjoi – was added to the team roster. On a late June episode of the Ride Channel&#x27;s &quot;Weekend Buzz&quot;, the addition of Kyle Berard to the Elephant team roster was revealed.

In early 2015, Vallely launched a new skateboard company called &quot;Street Plant&quot;. As of 2016, the Street Plant team roster includes Vallely, Kristian Svitak and Joey Jett. The company was inspired by the DIY ethic, which influenced Vallely deeply, and the constant pressure from sponsors which constrained his values. After cutting all ties with sponsorships, he established Street Plant along with his family, completely independent of industry financial, distribution and marketing support. Vallely is involved in the addition of personal artwork on the decks and complete skateboard ordered from his house in Long Beach, California.

== Music ==

Vallely joined a band called Resistance in 1985, although he only played one live show with the group, in which the bands 7 Seconds and Agression also played. Vallely was asked to leave the band for spending too much time on skateboarding.

Vallely was the lead singer for Mike V &amp; The Rats, and the band&#x27;s song &quot;The Days&quot; appeared in the video game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot; (THUG). Their song &quot;Never Give Up&quot; appeared in THUG&#x27;s successor, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground 2&quot;.

In 2003, Greg Ginn invited Vallely to sing for Black Flag at their 2003 reunion shows in Los Angeles, where he performed the entire &quot;My War&quot; album.

In 2013, Vallely formed a band called Good for You with Greg Ginn. Their debut album was released on SST Records in February 2013.

In November 2013 during a Black Flag show in Australia, singer Ron Reyes was fired mid-show by the band with Vallely doing the duties of informing him and replacing him on vocals for the remainder of the show. Reyes said that his microphone was taken and he was told to get off the stage by Vallely: &quot;&#x27;You&#x27;re done, party&#x27;s over get off it&#x27;s over...&#x27; He said something else to me but it was a lie so I won&#x27;t repeat it here. So with a sense of great relief that it was finally over I left the stage and walked to the hotel room. They finished the set with Mike V on vocals.&quot;

In January 2014, founding member Greg Ginn announced Vallely would be the new lead singer of Black Flag. In July 2015, Vallely put together the &#x27;Switchblades &amp; Urethane&#x27; music festival taking place at Alex&#x27;s Bar in Long Beach, California.

== Other ventures ==
=== Video game appearances ===
Vallely appears in the &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s&quot; skateboarding video game series, from the fourth release (&quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot;) onwards. He appears as a secret character in &quot;Pro Skater 4&quot;, but has been featured more prominently in the subsequent releases. In the fifth game of the series, &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, Vallely&#x27;s ingame character teaches a special trick in the game.

Vallely released his own skateboarding video game for the iPhone and the iPod Touch, entitled &quot;Mike V: Do or Die – Skateboarding&quot;, in February 2010.

=== Hockey ===
In 2010, Vallely signed a contract to play professional hockey for the Danbury Whalers of the Federal Hockey League, becoming the first-ever professional board sport athlete to play a traditional team sport at a professional level. In his first career game (October 23, 2010), he fought Joe Pelle of the Brooklyn Aviators, a career minor-league enforcer. Several seconds into the fight, Vallely lost his footing and landed awkwardly, breaking his right arm.

=== Podcasting ===
In 2015, Vallely started his own podcast, &quot;The Mike V Show&quot;, with his friend, author and podcaster Daniele Bolelli.

=== Films ===
Vallely has appeared in several films, including &quot;Paul Blart: Mall Cop&quot;, &quot;The Hangover, The Hangover Part III&quot; and &quot;XXX&quot;.

== Personal life and activism ==
Vallely has been married to his wife Ann since 1992. The couple have two daughters, born in 1992 and 2001. His family has been key in the establishment of some of his ventures, such as Street Plant. They have resided in Des Moines, Iowa since early 2021.

As of 2016, Vallely only agrees to give interviews about animal rights and safety of children athletes.

One of Vallely&#x27;s daughters, Emily, has been married to former Black Flag drummer Brandon Pertzborn since October 8, 2022.

=== Veganism and animal rights ===
At the age of seventeen, Vallely watched a television program about endangered African elephants which impacted and made him reflect on the harm that humans do to other species. This led him to become a vegetarian and subsequently vegan. His 1988 debut skateboard model had an African elephant as the artwork, because he wanted &quot;to remind people&quot; of them. His third signature model skateboard, 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Barnyard&quot;, had emblazoned the words &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Eat My Friends&quot; and was one of the first models that promoted vegetarianism. Vallely&#x27;s vocal opinions on this subject were typically met with derision by both skaters and promoters. In 1999, he and his family abandoned this lifestyle. He later stated that this decision was partly due to compromising himself to please his sponsors and that he felt &quot;lost&quot; for the next fifteen years.

In 2014, Vallely was touring with Black Flag as vocalist and before a show in Louisville, Kentucky he walked through the city and accidentally came across an open slaughterhouse, which &quot;completely crumble[d]&quot; him and motivated to change his diet again. After sharing this decision with his family, they all became vegans in 2015. In 2016, his two daughters and wife started the blog &quot;The Vintage Vegans&quot; which shares cruelty-free fashion and American cuisine options.

Vallely inspired his friend Ed Templeton to become a vegan in the early 1990s.

<doc id="619999" wikidata="Q3405667" url="?curid=619999" title="Llan Ffestiniog">
<text>Llan Ffestiniog, also known as Ffestiniog or simply Llan, is a village in Gwynedd (formerly in the county of Merionethshire), Wales, about 2 miles south of Blaenau Ffestiniog. Llan Ffestiniog is the older of the two communities, with its church and other buildings predating most of Blaenau Ffestiniog. The population was given as 864 in the 2011 census.

==Buildings==
Attractions near the village include the Rhaeadr Cynfal waterfalls and the remains of the Tomen-y-Mur Roman fort and amphitheatre. A decommissioned nuclear power station lies south of the village, at Trawsfynydd.

===Historic house===
Situated in the square opposite the Pengwern Arms, is the oldest dwelling and established business in the area, Meirion House, a Grade II* listed building. Its name is derived from the county of Meirionydd, and the core of the building is thought to date back to 1411. Several annexes were added over the years, with a business established in 1726. It has nevertheless retained much of its original character, including the original pitch pine and oak beams and lath and plaster ceiling, slate floors and inglenook fireplace with inset cast iron double oven. There is a headstone inlaid in the slate floor, part of which is under the second stairway, believed to have been constructed in the late 19th century.

Part of Meirion House was once a small drover&#x27;s bank, known as Banc y Ddafad Ddu (&quot;The Bank of the Black Sheep&quot;). In the early 19th century, it was a draper&#x27;s shop. In the early 20th century, it became a guest house, with the original visitors book dating back to 1909. It was used extensively by cyclists, and was at one time the official quarters of the National Cyclists Union (NCU). In the visitors book there is an entry referencing the ghost of &quot;Elizabeth&quot;. The house was owned by Thomas John Wynn, 5th Baron Newborough until 1925, when it was sold to Robert Thomas Williams. During World War II, officials from the National Gallery stayed there, whilst working at the Cwt y Bugail quarry, which was used to house the nation&#x27;s art galleries&#x27; treasures. The houses next door were built on the site of Abbey Arms, an old coaching inn, which once had its own stables.

==Notable residents==
Notable persons who live, or have lived, in Llan Ffestiniog include actor, author and comedian Mici Plwm, journalist and TV presenter Mared Parry. The cartoonist Mal Humphreys, otherwise known as Mumph, who worked for many Welsh and UK broadcasters and publications. His life&#x27;s work is now held at the National Library of Wales

==Writers on the village==
Elizabeth Gaskell, the Victorian era writer whose novels and short stories were a critique of the era&#x27;s inequality in industrial cities and of its attitudes towards women, was fond of Ffestiniog. Mr and Mrs Gaskell visited the village and spent some time there on their wedding tour. On another, later visit in 1844, it was at the inn there that their young son William caught scarlet fever, from which he died. It was to turn her thoughts from her bereavement that she took her husband&#x27;s advice and began to write her first novel, &quot;Mary Barton&quot;.
George Borrow wrote briefly about Ffestiniog and its church-side pub, the &quot;Pengwern&quot;, in his travelogue &quot;Wild Wales&quot;. He says, 

==Transport==
Ffestiniog railway station opened on 30 May 1868. It was closed to passenger services on 2 January 1960. There are several bus services running.

==Legend==
The area is connected with Blodeuwedd, Lleu Llaw Gyffes and Gronw Pebr, all characters in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. An old rock on the bank of Afon Cynfal, to the south of the village, is called Gronw&#x27;s Slate. It has a small hole through it, and it is believed that this was the rock that Gronw grasped to defend himself against a spear thrown by Lleu. Four km or 2 miles east of the village is Llyn Morwynion, a lake which is now a reservoir, where Blodeuwedd and her maidens of Ardudwy are said to have drowned; nearby are the Beddau Gwŷr Ardudwy (graves of the men of Ardudwy).

<doc id="620000" wikidata="Q1132569" url="?curid=620000" title="Full Members' Cup">
<text>The Full Members&#x27; Cup was an association football cup competition held in English football from 1985 to 1992. It was also known under its sponsored names of the [[Simod|Simod Cup]] from 1987 to 1989 and the [[Zenith Data Systems|Zenith Data Systems Cup]] from 1989 to 1992.

The competition was created after the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, when English clubs were banned from European competition, as an additional competition for clubs in the top two English League divisions. The competition&#x27;s name refers to the clubs that were Full Members of the Football League, with full voting rights; teams from the lower two divisions were Associate Members and were only eligible for the Associate Members&#x27; Cup (now known as the EFL Trophy). The initial Full Members&#x27; Cup did not include the six teams that had qualified for 1985–86 European competitions, as these played in the Super Cup instead.

While the European ban of English clubs was partially lifted for 1990–91, and fully lifted for 1991–92, the Full Members&#x27; Cup survived through the end of 1991–92, its seventh season. The competition was then cancelled the following season when the Football League First Division was superseded by the Premier League as the top division.

Seven finals took place between 1986 and 1992. Blackburn Rovers and Reading were the only Second Division teams to win the cup.

Chelsea and Nottingham Forest were the most successful teams in the competition, with both of them winning it twice.

==Participants==
The competition was open to all teams from the top two levels of the English Leagues, namely the First and Second Divisions. The six First Division teams that qualified for 1985–86 European play were invited to the English Super Cup tournament rather than the Full Members&#x27; Cup.

Some eligible teams chose not to compete in the tournament in a particular year, while four teams in the First Division throughout the seven seasons of the tournament never entered the competition – Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.

<text>Llan is a village in Powys, Wales, located on the B4518 road to Llanidloes, from Llanbrynmair.

The parish church of St Mary is located here.

This area was the original centre of Llanbrynmair up to the early to mid 19th century. At this time the community relocated to its current location at the junction of the A470 &amp; B4518 as a result of the new turnpike road opening (built in 1821) and the arrival of the railway in 1861.

<doc id="620012" wikidata="Q1024935" url="?curid=620012" title="Harlech">
<text>Harlech () is a seaside resort and community in Gwynedd, North Wales, and formerly in the historic county of Merionethshire. It lies on Tremadog Bay in the Snowdonia National Park. Before 1966, it belonged to the Meirionydd District of the 1974 County of Gwynedd. Its landmark Harlech Castle was begun in 1283 by Edward I of England, captured by Owain Glyndŵr, and in the 1480s, a stronghold of Henry Tudor. Once on a seaside cliff face, it is now half a mile (800 m) inland. New housing has appeared in the low town and in the high town around the shopping street, church and castle. The two are linked by a steep road called &quot;Twtil&quot;. Of its 1,447 inhabitants, 51 per cent habitually speak Welsh. The built-up area with Llanfair had a population of 1,762 in the 2001 census, over half of whom lacked Welsh identity, and the electoral ward which includes Talsarnau 1,997 in the 2011 census. The estimate in 2019 was 1,881. The population of the community, which includes just the village, was 1,263 as of the 2021 census.

==Etymology==
The exact derivation of the name &quot;Harlech&quot; is unclear. Some, mostly older sources, derive it from &quot;Arddlech&quot;, i.e. (high) + (rock), referring to the prominent crag on which the castle stands. Recent sources prefer a simpler derivation from the two Welsh words (fair/fine) and &quot;llech&quot; (slate/rock).

As late as the 19th century, some texts referred to &quot;Harddlech&quot; and &quot;Harddlech Castle&quot;. This name appears in the mid-19th century translation of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;: &quot;And one afternoon he was at Harddlech in Ardudwy, at a court of his. And they were seated upon the rock of Harddlech overlooking the sea.&quot; Contemporary documents from the time of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; do not mention Harlech, referring only to Llywelyn building his castle &quot;at Ardudwy&quot;.

==History==
In 2007, a Lockheed P-38 Lightning (a World War II-era fighter aircraft) was rediscovered on Harlech beach. It has been described as &quot;one of the most important WWII finds in recent history.&quot; The &quot;International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery&quot; (TIGHAR) expressed an interest in salvaging the wreck of the U.S. Army Air Forces plane, known as the &quot;Maid of Harlech&quot;. 

However, in August 2019, Cadw, the Welsh government&#x27;s historic environment service, gave the remains scheduled status, making it the first legally designated military aircraft crash site in the UK to be protected for its historic and archaeological interest. The site is also controlled under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. The aircraft came down in September 1942 when it was on a gunnery practice mission. The pilot was Second Lt Robert F Elliott, 24, of Rich Square, North Carolina, survived the crash, only to be reported missing in action a few months later.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name existed including Talsarnau community. The ward population at the 2011 census was 1,997. From the 2022 Gwynedd Council election the ward was increased in size to include Llanbedr and Llanfair, renamed &quot;Harlech a Llanbedr&quot; and the representation increased to 2 county councillors.

==Transport==
Harlech railway station is a stop on the Cambrian Coast Line. Services run between and , operated by Transport for Wales.

Local bus services are operated by Lloyds Coaches, with services to Porthmadog and Barmouth.

The town contains Ffordd Pen Llech, a street down the rock spur to the north of the castle. It is the steepest signed, public paved road in the United Kingdom and one of the steepest in the world.

==Educational facilities==
Ysgol Ardudwy is the county secondary school for children aged 11–16. Ysgol Tanycastell is the town&#x27;s primary school for children aged 3–11. Wales&#x27;s only long-term adult residential college, Coleg Harlech, also known as the &quot;college of second chance&quot;, existed in the town from 1927 to 2017. It was renowned for its mixed classical and brutalist architecture. Harlech&#x27;s library, previously run by Gwynedd Council, also closed in 2017. Harlech&#x27;s Old Library Institute runs as Harlech Hwb, offering cost-of-living support and click-and-collect library books from Gwynedd Libraries.

==Demographics==
The 2011 census recorded 1,762 usual residents. The village is fairly Anglicised, with 48% of residents having been born in Wales and 46.9% born in England. Correspondingly, only 42.6% reported having a Welsh national identity.

==Recreation==
Harlech has a beach backed with sand dunes and the Royal Saint David&#x27;s Golf Club, which hosted its fifth British Ladies Amateur in 2009. The Rhinogydd (or Rhinogs) range of mountains rises to the east.

Harlech has a Scout hut, which acts as a base for outdoor recreational activities.

==In traditional and popular culture==
*A street in Harlech, Ffordd Pen Llech, was recognised in 2019 by Guinness World Records as the steepest residential street in the world with a gradient of 1:2.67 (37.45%); however, Baldwin Street in Dunedin, New Zealand, was then recognised with a gradient of 1:2.86 (35%). The steepness was determined by measuring consistently on the lower side of the street – the left or right, whichever was lower. It was later decided that measuring consistently in the middle of the street would be more accurate. This gave Baldwin Street a gradient of 34.8% and Ffordd Pen Llech one of 28.6%, so the title returned to Baldwin Street.
*In the second branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; (&quot;Branwen, Daughter of Llŷr&quot;), Harlech is the seat of Bendigeidfran, Branwen&#x27;s brother and king of the Isle of the Mighty.
*The song &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; is traditionally said to describe events during the seven-year siege of the castle in 1461–1468.
*ITV Wales &amp; West was formerly known as HTV/Harlech Television after its founder Lord Harlech.

<text>Cardigan (, ) is a town and community in the county of Ceredigion, Wales. Positioned on the tidal reach of the River Teifi at the point where Ceredigion meets Pembrokeshire, Cardigan was the county town of the historic county of Cardiganshire. Cardigan is the second-largest town in Ceredigion. The largest town, Aberystwyth, is one of the two administrative centres; the other is Aberaeron.

The settlement at Cardigan was developed around the Norman castle built in the late 11th or early 12th century. The castle was the location of the 1176 Cardigan eisteddfod, precursor of the present-day National Eisteddfod. The town became an important port in the 18th century, but declined by the early 20th century owing to its shallow harbour. The castle underwent restoration in 2014.

The population in 2001 was 4,203, reducing slightly to 4,184 at the 2011 census.

==Toponymy==
Cardigan is an anglicisation of the Welsh &quot;&quot; (&quot;Ceredig&#x27;s land&quot;), the surrounding territory its Norman castle once controlled. Ceredig was supposedly one of the sons of Cunedda Wledig, who Welsh legend records invaded from the north to recover lands in Roman Britain from invading Irishmen in late antiquity.

The Welsh name &#x27; refers to its position by the mouth (&#x27;) of the River Teifi.

== History ==

=== Roman Britain ===
The nearest known Roman forts were at Loventium and Bremia at the gold mines near Llanio above the River Teifi on the Sarn Helen road.

=== Middle ages ===

The present town grew up near the medieval forts established to control the access of the Teifi and its confluents to Cardigan Bay on the Irish Sea. A castle was built by Roger de Montgomery in 1093 after a Norman army conquered Ceredigion. Its hinterland was regained by Owain Gwynedd, Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, and Gruffydd ap Rhys in October 1136 after their victory at Crug Mawr over Norman forces army led by Roberts fitz Martin and fitz Stephen and Maurice FitzGerald. Rhys ap Gruffydd fortified the town and was credited with the establishment of the castle near the bridge over the Teifi. In 1176, he instituted the first eisteddfod. Contestants came from all over the British Isles to compete for chairs in music and poetry. Lord Rhys&#x27; grandson Maelgwn razed the castle and sacked the town.

Cardigan became an important trade centre. In 1227 a weekly market was established which continues to this day. Welsh rule over Cardigan continued, for some periods under royal lordship, until it was annexed to the English crown in 1283 when the county of Cardiganshire was created. The town wall was built in the 1240s and the castle was rebuilt. St Mary&#x27;s Church was established as a Benedictine Priory and parish church in mediaeval times and survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The castle ceased being the administrative centre of the county with the Act of Union in 1536 and by the early 17th century was already falling into ruins.

=== Early modern period ===

A small Benedictine priory operated until the Reformation and the more important abbey of St Dogmael&#x27;s was also nearby. With Wales formally annexed by England through the Laws in Wales Acts, political and domestic stability boosted economic prosperity through the increase in maritime trade. At the end of the 16th century the port&#x27;s principal trade was fishing, but over the next century trade expanded to include a range of imports and exports, and a Customs House was established to collect revenues.

During the Civil War, the town&#x27;s castle was held for a time by the Royalists. In the 17th century, the residence erected around the old priory was famed as the home of Orinda (Catherine Philips), the friend of Jeremy Taylor.

The herring fishery developed and by the beginning of the 18th century there was a large merchant fleet. Exports included herring and salmon, slate, bark for tanning, corn and ale. Imports included oranges, manufactured goods, building materials and coal. Industries that developed included shipbuilding, brickworks, a foundry, ropemakers and sailmakers.

A county jail was erected in 1793.

In 1819, the ship &quot;Albion&quot; left Cardigan for New Brunswick, carrying the first Welsh settlers to Canada; on board were 27 Cardigan families, many of whom were farmers.

=== Town centre ===

In the 18th and early 19th century, Cardigan was the commercial centre of its county and the most important port in South Wales, exporting slate, oats, barley, and butter. In 1815, it possessed 314 ships totaling . This was seven times as many vessels as Cardiff and three times as many as Swansea. It had a thriving shipbuilding industry, with over 200 vessels being built both in Cardigan and downstream in the village of Llandudoch (St Dogmaels). By mid-century, it was connected with the Welsh rail network but its harbour was obstructed by a sand bar that made it dangerous for vessels over 300 tons burden except during the high spring tides.

Rural industries and craftsmen were an important part of life in a country town. Information recorded in &quot;Trade Directories&quot; show that in 1830 there were &quot;Thirteen boot makers, three bakers, one miller, four blacksmiths, seven carpenters, two coopers, six tailors, five dressmakers and milliners, two straw hat makers, two weavers, three curriers, three saddlers, two whitesmiths, four glaziers, five maltsters, two printers, two tanners and one stonemason&quot;. The houses were mostly of slate and the streets narrow, steep, and irregular, with a grammar school erected in 1804 and a national school in 1848. The town also had a public library.

Cardigan Guildhall was built between 1858 and 1860 on the site of the old grammar school and a house with a coach-house owned by Abraham Morgan. The cost of building was £1,880 5s for the front buildings, and £2,174 15s for the markets.

By the mid-19th century there were more than 60 taverns in the town. The decline of the port was hastened by the coming of the railway in 1886. The river silted up and larger vessels could no longer reach the port, which had largely become inactive by the early part of the 20th century. Some test dredging was carried out in 2009.

For the last 40 years of the 20th century, a factory in the town made 35,000 pairs of jeans per week for Marks &amp; Spencer, but closed in 2002 with the loss of 400 jobs when M&amp;S sourced from overseas. A new jeans manufacturer—the Hiut Denim Company—opened in 2012, employing some of the original staff and in 2017 became globally recognised for its connection with Meghan Markle.
In 2006 and 2008, the town undertook a coordinated programme of building works, sympathetically restoring many of the shop facades in the town centre. The quayside has been rebuilt with a new civic area and landing stage.

Until 2011, traders in Cardigan were represented by the Chamber of Commerce. Cardigan Traders&#x27; Group was set up in that year, attracting half of the members of the Chamber of Commerce. The new group was set to meet in February 2011 to decide how to proceed.

Cardigan was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.

Cardigan and District Community Hospital closed in 2019, after outpatient services were transferred to Cardigan Integrated Health Centre. The future of the former hospital site is under discussion.

==Geography==
Cardigan lies astride the Afon Teifi and includes the last bridging point of the river before the sea northwest. It is northwest of Cardiff and from London. The majority of the town was north of the river before the 20th century. Afon Mwldan which flows south to the west of the town centre has suffered from pollution. The town and rivers are prone to flooding. An earthquake of magnitude 4.4 was felt in the community on 17 February 2018; this was the biggest UK earthquake in ten years.

Glaciolacustrine clay from local brick pits in Bath House Road and on the site of King George&#x27;s field was used for brick-making until the early 20th century.

===Climate===
Cardigan experiences a maritime climate with comfortable summers and cold winters. The nearest Met Office weather station for which online records are available is at Aberporth approximately east-northeast.

Typically, fewer than 3 days of the year will reach a value above . The highest temperature recorded at Aberporth was , on 19 July 2006.
On average 18.3 nights will report air frost and the coldest night of the year should fall to . The coldest month was January 1963, with a mean minimum temperature of .

Rainfall averages around per year, with at least falling on 146.4 days.

==Cardigan Castle==
In 1176, Cardigan Castle became the site of the first competitive Eisteddfod. Cardigan also hosted the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1942 and 1976. The castle was for many years privately owned and became run down and derelict. The town council itself showed little interest in saving it. However, a group of volunteers and the local Catholic priest, Seamus Cunane, working separately, did raise its profile. Ceredigion County Council bought it in 2003. The castle and house underwent restoration in 2014.

The castle is open to the public. There is luxury accommodation for hire, a heritage centre with education facilities, a restaurant, an events and open-air concert area, and there are rooms for hire for classes.

==Listed buildings==
Including the castle (Grade I-listed) and the old bridge (Grade II*), there are over 100 listed buildings in Cardigan community, most in the town itself. These include the Old Shire Hall which ids Grade II* listed.

==Demographics==
Cardigan is the second largest town in Ceredigion with 4,203 inhabitants (2001), reducing slightly to 4,184 at the 2011 census.

At the 2001 census more than 69% of the residents were recorded as being able to speak or understand spoken Welsh, with 45% able to speak, read and write in the language. In 2011 54.6% were able to speak Welsh. In 1176, and again 800 years later, the National Eisteddfod was held in the town (also in 1942). In 2003 the community, together with the Welsh Language Board, set up a language action plan designed to provide opportunities for people of all ages to get together to speak Welsh.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Cardigan, at community (town) and county level: Cardigan Town Council (Cyngor Tref Aberteifi) and Ceredigion County Council (Cyngor Sir Ceredigion). The town council meets at Ty Cadwgan at Cardigan Castle, and has its offices at 36 Pendre. Cardigan Town Council comprises thirteen councillors. Following the 2017 election the council was unique in Wales for having a female majority (seven women, six men).

===Administrative history===
Cardigan was an ancient parish, also known as St Mary&#x27;s after its parish church. The town was administered as a borough from 1284, when it received its first municipal charter.

In 1832, the Cardigan constituency was enlarged to include the Bridgend and Abbey hamlets of the parish of St Dogmaels on the south side of the River Teifi in Pembrokeshire. The borough of Cardigan was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country; as part of those reforms the borough was enlarged to match the constituency. The borough then straddled Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire until 1889, when the Local Government Act 1888 directed that boroughs could no longer straddle county boundaries, and so the borough was placed entirely in Cardiganshire.

The Cardiganshire assizes were held at Cardigan Castle until 1763 when they transferred to Shire Hall on High Street. In 1889, Cardiganshire County Council was formed; unlike the assizes, it chose to hold its meetings alternately at Lampeter Town Hall and Aberaeron Town Hall. Levi James, one of the town&#x27;s two inaugural county councillors, was immediately made an alderman and became the second chairman of the council.

The borough of Cardigan was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Cardigan was created instead, covering the area of the abolished borough. District-level functions passed to Ceredigion District Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Ceredigion County Council. Some of the parts of the old parish of St Dogmaels which had been included in Cardigan borough in 1836 were returned to Pembrokeshire in 2003.

== Amenities ==
The town has several health centres, a college, modern arts centre (with three-screen cinema), theatre and recently refurbished 19th century guildhall housing market stalls. For shopping there are supermarkets, town centre shops and several trading estates.

===Education===
Cardigan&#x27;s college, &quot;Coleg Ceredigion&quot;, is located north of the town centre and educates 700 full-time and 2,000 part-time students in both Welsh and English languages, and is Ceredigion&#x27;s only further education college. The college became a constituent college of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. In a special ceremony at the guildhall, the university&#x27;s vice-chancellor, Prof Medwin Hughes, chair of the university council, Ven Randolph Thomas and Dr. Brinley Jones, president of UWTSD officially welcomed Coleg Ceredigion to the UWTSD group.

The college and Cardigan Secondary School, &quot;Ysgol Uwchradd Aberteifi&quot; share the same site. &quot;Ysgol Gynradd Gymunedol Aberteifi&quot; was established in 2008 when the former Cardigan Infant and Cardigan Junior schools were combined. The school educates more than 300 pupils.

===Worship===
The parish church is dedicated to St Mary.

Cardigan is the site of Our Lady of Cardigan, a Roman Catholic shrine, also known as the shrine to Our Lady of the Taper.

Other churches include:
*Bethania Welsh Baptist Church, on William Street, first built in 1775–76 but modified in 1819, 1843 and finally in 1846–47 to the design of architect Daniel Evans of Cardigan.
*Mount Zion Baptist Church, which was built in 1878 in mixed Romanesque/Lombardic style, to the design of architect George Morgan of Carmarthen. It is Grade 2 listed.
*Tabernacl Methodist Chapel, built in 1760, rebuilt in 1807 and 1832, restored and extended by architect Lloyd Edwards in 1886. The body of the present chapel, dated 1832, is built in Romanesque style but was deeply altered in 1902 with a large projecting central organ chamber, flanking porches and new stucco cladding, and in 1986 when the pyramid roof was modified to a flatter design.

There is also a small Islamic centre on Quay Street called the &quot;Cardigan Islamic Cultural Centre&quot;. It serves the local Muslim community in the town. 

===Leisure activities===

There is a leisure centre in the grounds of the college offering sport and fitness facilities, and a swimming pool and leisure complex (a registered charity opened in 1977) in Napier Street. A public library was situated in &#x27;Canolfan Teifi&#x27; near the guildhall, but, in July 2017 moved to the local Council Offices on Morgan Street.

===Sport===
Cardigan Rugby Football Club was founded in 1876 and plays in WRU Division Two West. It is a feeder club for the Llanelli Scarlets.

Cardigan Golf Club is a 6,500-yard 18 hole clifftop course at Gwbert, north of the town. The current clubhouse was opened in 1977 but the links course originated with 9 holes in 1895.

A blue plaque was put up at Cardigan Quay in 2018 to honour multiple powerboat champion, boat-builder and commentator Jonathan Jones in his home town.

===River===
Moorings in the River Teifi are under the control of Afon Teifi Fairways and there is some deepwater mooring on the south bank downstream of the old bridge. Other midstream moorings exist from Cardigan downstream to the estuary and there are occasional slipways on both sides of the river. There is an activity centre by the old bridge for kayaking in the river when tide and river conditions permit.

Cardigan Lifeboat Station is situated at Poppit Sands on the Teifi estuary, having been operational since 1849 apart from the period 1872–1931. Its boathouse and shop are open to the public during the summer months.

===Annual events===
Barley Saturday, an agricultural event, has been held in the town on the Saturday following the last Friday in April since the 19th century. Historically the farmers from the surrounding area would come to the town to hire workers and to inspect stallions that are put out to stud. In modern times the horses have become the centre of attention. After judging, the horses are paraded through the town followed by vintage tractors, cars and motorbikes.

In August there is a wine and food festival.

Each August (since 2014), British record label Fruits de Mer Records organizes a three-day psychedelic music festival, The Dream of Dr. Sardonicus: A Festival of Psychedelia, which is held at The Cellar Bar in Cardigan.

==Transport==

The A487 coastal trunk road provides links to the northeast and southwest; the A478 south to Narberth and Tenby and the A484 southeast to Swansea. A bypass was constructed to the southeast of the town in 1989–90, including a new concrete bridge (Priory Bridge) over the River Teifi. Bus services link Cardigan with most nearby towns and villages in Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire.

Cardigan railway station was the terminus of the Whitland and Cardigan Railway. On 2 August 1877, the Whitland and Taf Vale Railway Company obtained an act of Parliament giving authorisation to extend the line to Cardigan. Completion to Cardigan was slow; the opening was finally achieved on 1 September 1886 and on the same day the Great Western Railway took over the working of the line.

The railway station closed to passengers prior to the Beeching Axe on 10 September 1962 but remained open to goods traffic until 27 May 1963. After that, the station remained open as a coal depot until April 1965, staffed by British Railways staff until November 1964. Final closure came on 6 September 1965. The old goods shed marks the site of the former station. A local Welsh language newspaper uses the nickname of the line, &quot;Cardi bach&quot;, as does the shuttle bus service between Cardigan and New Quay.

The section of old trackbed between Cardigan and Cilgerran is now a footpath and cycle track to the Teifi estuary woodlands and marshes and the Welsh Wildlife Centre.

<text>The Fort Worth Cavalry was an Arena Football League team which operated for a single season, 1994, in the National Conference. The league did not want to abandon the idea of having a franchise in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, a major media market, after the demise of the Dallas Texans (1990–1993), and granted a new franchise to an ownership group in Fort Worth. The team was owned by Peter &quot;Woody&quot; Kern and led by head coach Michael Trigg. The team struggled with ticket sales and financial issues lead to the team being folded after the 1994 season.

==History==
In December 1993, the Arena Football League announced that Fort Worth would join the league as one of three expansion teams for 1994. The Fort Worth Cavalry franchise was owned by businessman and minor-league baseball team owner Peter &quot;Woody&quot; Kern. The Fort Worth franchise replaced the Dallas Texans as the Metroplex&#x27;s Arena League representative. Kern folded the team after the 1994 season due to attendance and revenue problems then, in 1995, sold the franchise to concert promoter Doug Logan and purchased a majority stake in the rival Tampa Bay Storm.

The team struggled to find buyers for season tickets. In addition to ongoing season-ticket sales, the club began selling single-game tickets for the 1994 season on May 2, 1994.

To drum up regional interest in the team and the sport, the Cavalry&#x27;s first pre-season game was played at the Myriad Convention Center in Oklahoma City. The game was one of four exhibition games played by AFL teams in non-AFL cities in 1994. Halftime festivities included a tribute to longtime Oklahoma Sooners football coach Barry Switzer, then recently named as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.

The Cavalry played their regular season home games at the Tarrant County Convention Center. All but the final home game were played on Monday nights due to other events tying up more lucrative weekend dates. They ended the season with the lowest home attendance of any AFL team in 1994. On the field, however, they were somewhat successful, advancing to the playoffs after finishing one game under .500 in the regular season. They lost to the Orlando Predators in the first round of the playoffs and were disbanded shortly thereafter.

===Off-field moves===
Fort Worth hired Arena Football League veteran Michael Trigg as its head coach. Trigg played college football at East Texas State University and as a quarterback led the Detroit Drive to the 1989 and 1990 Arena Bowl championships. After Trigg retired as a player, he spent two seasons as an assistant coach at ETSU and three seasons as offensive coordinator for the AFL&#x27;s Dallas Texans. After the financial collapse of the Cavalry after the 1994 season, Trigg moved on to become the head coach of the Milwaukee Mustangs in 1995.

In his role as the team&#x27;s general manager, Trigg hired NFL veteran Tate Randle as defensive coordinator, Marshall Foreman as special-teams coach, and Terry Gray as coach of the offensive and defensive lines as well as director of player personnel.

Controversy erupted when fans found out that one of the team&#x27;s largest advertisers was Club Legends, a &quot;totally nude&quot; female strip club in neighboring Arlington. The strip club&#x27;s promotional efforts included having its female employees wearing Club Legends T-shirts around the arena and a sideline advertisement urging Cavalry fans to &quot;Call 1-800-NUDE BAR&quot;.

===Roster moves===
On December 13, 1993, the Cavalry, Las Vegas Sting, and Milwaukee Mustangs participated in the 1994 AFL Expansion Draft. Fort Worth acquired 16 players, one in each round, including 9 former Dallas Texans. One of these, then-current Dallas Cowboys player Lincoln Coleman, was chosen in the 16th round to secure his rights should the Cowboys release him.

In late April 1994, Fort Worth signed Steve Berry to play wide receiver and defensive back. Berry was one of 30 prospective players (along with quarterbacks Todd Hammel and Kyle Mackey plus wideout Robert Kirksey) in the Cavalry training camp and pre-season rosters. Before the regular season began, the roster was trimmed to the league maximum of 23 players.

Ultimately, Mackey split the starting job at quarterback with Hammel who had played for the Texans under coach Michael Trigg the previous two seasons. Mackey was injured during a July 1994 game against the Albany Firebirds. After the Cavalry shut down, Hammel followed Trigg to the Milwaukee Mustangs for the 1995 season.

After veteran kicker Ian Howfield departed for the Baltimore Colts of the Canadian Football League just before the regular season started, the Cavalry signed local favorite Trey Weir as a replacement in late May 1994. Cut by the Colts in mid-June, Howfield returned to the Cavalry for the remainder of the season.

Kelly Blackwell, a tight end for the Chicago Bears in 1992 and Dallas Cowboys in 1993, joined the Cavalry in June 1994. Blackwell has strong ties to the Fort Worth area having played high school football at Richland High School and college football for Texas Christian University.

<doc id="620025" wikidata="Q1139893" url="?curid=620025" title="Criccieth">
<text>Criccieth, also spelled Cricieth (), is a town and community in Gwynedd, Wales, on the boundary between the Llŷn Peninsula and Eifionydd. The town is west of Porthmadog, east of Pwllheli and south of Caernarfon. It had a population of 1,826 in 2001, reducing to 1,753 at the 2011 census.

The town is a seaside resort, popular with families. Attractions include the ruins of Criccieth Castle, which have extensive views over the town and surrounding countryside. Nearby on Castle Street is Cadwalader&#x27;s Ice Cream Parlour, opened in 1927, and the High Street has several bistro-style restaurants. In the centre is Y Maes, part of the original medieval town common.

The town is noted for its fairs, held on 23 May and 29 June every year, when large numbers of people visit the fairground and the market which spreads through many of the streets of the town.

Criccieth hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1975, and in 2003 was granted Fairtrade Town status. It won the Wales in Bloom competition each year from 1999 to 2004.

The town styles itself the &quot;Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia&quot;.

==Etymology==
The earliest recorded form of the place name Criccieth in Welsh is found in , where reference is made to the imprisonment of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn in the &#x27;castle of Cruceith&quot;&quot;&#x27; (Middle Welsh orthography: &quot;Kastell Krukeith&quot;). The form was used by Iolo Goch in a famous 14th century poem addressed to Sir Hywel y Fwyall, custodian of the castle. 

There are a number of theories as to the meaning, but the most popular is that it comes from : &#x27; may mean &#x27;prisoner&#x27; and thus the name could mean &#x27;prisoner&#x27;s rock&#x27;, a reference to the imprisonment of one of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth&#x27;s sons in the castle by his brother. However, &#x27; has the primary meaning in Middle Welsh of &#x27;serf[s]&#x27; and the name could refer to a bond community nearby. In later medieval times the settlement was also known as &quot;&quot; (martyr&#x27;s town), probably a reference to Saint Catherine, after whom the parish church is named.

The Welsh Language Commissioner gives the standard form of the name as &quot;Cricieth&quot;. However, the post town, Ordnance Survey and the legal name of the community all use the spelling &quot;Criccieth&quot;. The town council has the power to change the legal name of the community, or to adopt different forms of the name for use in Welsh and English language contexts. The council has been petitioned to adopt the Cricieth spelling on multiple occasions, dating back to at least 1969 when the county council asked the urban district council (the town council&#x27;s predecessor) to change the name, but it declined to do so. This led to a row between the two councils over various road signs the county council had already put up with the Cricieth spelling. The town council maintained its position of using the spelling Criccieth in both Welsh and English contexts when similar requests for it to change the name were made in 1985 and 2008.

==History==
The area around Criccieth was settled during the Bronze Age, and a chambered tomb, Cae Dyni, survives on the coast to the east of the town; it consists of seven upright stones, and there are 13 cup marks, arranged in several groups. Evidence from other sites on the Llŷn Peninsula suggests that the area was colonised by a wave of Celtic settlers, who explored the Irish Sea, probably around the 4th century BC. Ptolemy calls the peninsula (English: Peninsula of the Gangani); the Gangani were a tribe of Irish Celts, and it is thought there may have been strong and friendly links with Leinster.

Although it is thought that Criccieth Castle was built around 1230 by Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, who had controlled the area since 1202, the first record of the building was in 1239, when the administrative centre of Eifionydd was moved from Dolbenmaen.

In the later years of his life, Llywelyn turned his attention to his successor. Welsh law stipulated that illegitimate sons had equal rights with legitimate sons; Llywelyn sought to ensure that Dafydd ap Llywelyn, his legitimate offspring, would inherit Gwynedd in place of his eldest, but illegitimate, son Gruffydd. On Llywelyn&#x27;s death in 1240, Dafydd sought to secure his position. Dafydd was half English and feared that his pure Welsh half-brother would be able to gather support to overthrow him. Gruffydd was held prisoner in Criccieth Castle, until he was handed over to Henry III of England in 1241, and moved to the Tower of London.

Dafydd ap Llywelyn died in 1246, without leaving an heir, and was succeeded by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, his nephew. Edward I had inherited the English throne in 1272, and in 1276 declared Llywelyn a rebel. By 1277, Edward&#x27;s armies had captured the Isle of Anglesey, and were encamped at Deganwy; the settlement, the Treaty of Aberconwy, forced Llywelyn to acknowledge Edward as his sovereign, and stripped him of much of his territory. Dafydd ap Gruffydd, Llywelyn&#x27;s younger brother, attacked the English forces at Hawarden in 1282, setting off a widespread rebellion throughout Wales; Edward responded with a further invasion of Gwynedd, during which Llywelyn was killed on the battlefield at Cilmeri.
With the final defeat of Gwynedd, Edward set about consolidating his rule in Wales. Criccieth Castle was extended and reshaped, becoming one of a ring of castles surrounding Edward&#x27;s newly conquered territories. A township developed to support the garrison and a charter was granted in 1284; the charter was intended to create a plantation of English burgesses who would provide food for the soldiers from the arable land behind the &quot;Dinas&quot; and the grazings on the slopes beyond. Weekly markets were held on Thursdays and there were annual fairs on 25 April and 18 October, the evangelical feasts of Saint Mark and Saint Luke.

The new administration soon proved unpopular among the native Welsh, and in 1294, Madog ap Llywelyn led a national revolt against English rule. Criccieth was besieged for several months over the winter; 41 residents sought refuge within its walls, joining the garrison of 29 men under William de Leybourne, until supplies were brought in from Ireland the following April. The following year, the castle was again used as a prison, housing captives taken in Edward&#x27;s wars against Scotland.

Three Welshmen who had settled in the borough, which was supposedly reserved for the English, were evicted in 1337, but times were about to change. Hywel ap Gruffydd was appointed constable of the castle in 1359, the first Welshman to hold the post. The following year came mayor of the town, holding the office for twenty years; in a poem of praise, Iolo Goch described him as &quot;a puissant knight, head of a garrison guarding the land&quot;. By 1374 eight jurymen from the borough had Welsh names.
Richard II was deposed and imprisoned in 1399, and died in mysterious circumstances the following year. Opposition to the new king, Henry IV, was particularly strong in Wales and Cheshire, and in 1400 serious civil unrest broke out in Chester. Henry had already declared Owain Glyndŵr, a descendant of the Princes of Powys, a traitor, and on 16 September 1400 Owain launched a revolt. He was proclaimed Prince of Wales, and within days a number of towns in the north east of Wales had been attacked. By 1401 the whole of northern and central Wales had rallied to Owain&#x27;s cause, and by 1403 villages throughout the country were rising in support. English castles and manor houses fell and were occupied by Owain&#x27;s supporters. Although the garrison at Criccieth Castle had been reinforced, a French fleet in the Irish Sea stopped supplies getting through, and the castle fell in the spring of 1404. The castle was sacked; its walls were torn down; and both the castle and borough were burned. The castle was never to be reoccupied, while the town was to become a small Welsh backwater, no longer involved in affairs of state. The town was described in 1847 as follows,
The town expanded in the 19th century with the coming of new transportation links. In 1807 a turnpike road was built from Tremadog to Porthdinllaen, which was intended to be the main port for traffic to Ireland; and with the construction of the &quot;Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway&quot; in 1868, the town began to develop as a Victorian seaside resort.

Criccieth solicitor David Lloyd George was elected as Liberal Member of Parliament for the Caernarfon Boroughs in 1890. He was to hold the seat for 55 years, during which he was Prime Minister from 1916 to 1922, contributing greatly to victory in the First World War (he was &#x27;the man who won the war&#x27;) through brilliant administration, leadership skills and personal energy, and negotiating the ill-fated Versailles peace treaty. Before that he was one of the great welfare reformers of the 20th century, starting old age pensions and unemployment payments. His position as a leading statesman brought Criccieth national and international prominence that it had never previously enjoyed; the town still has many locations connected with Lloyd George and his family.

Disaster struck Criccieth in October 1927; a great storm in the Irish Sea stopped the tidal flow, causing a double high tide. High seas and strong on-shore winds destroyed houses at Abermarchnad, the pressure of the waves punching holes through the back walls; the houses subsequently had to be demolished and the occupants rehoused.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Criccieth, at community (town) and county level: Criccieth Town Council (Cyngor Tref Criccieth) and Gwynedd Council (Cyngor Gwynedd). The town council meets at the Memorial Hall on High Street.

The town forms part of the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency for elections to the House of Commons, and also forms part of the Dwyfor Meirionnydd constituency for the Senedd.

===Administrative history===

Criccieth was an ancient parish. It was also the main town in the ancient commote of Eifionydd, which in 1284 was made part of the new county of Caernarfonshire under the Statute of Rhuddlan. Also in 1284 the town was made a borough under a charter granted by Edward I of England. The first mayor was William de Leybourne, who was appointed constable of the castle a month after the charter was granted.

It became customary for the constable of the castle to also serve as mayor &quot;ex officio&quot;, and the Town Hall (also known as the Guildhall) was built within the castle grounds. A government survey of boroughs in 1835 found that the borough corporation had very few powers. The role of mayor and constable of the castle had become hereditary; in 1835 it was held by William Ormsby-Gore, who lived in Shropshire.

Given its limited powers, the borough was left unreformed when the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 reformed most ancient boroughs across the country into municipal boroughs. The old corporation continued to operate, but with very few functions. In order to provide more modern forms of local government, a local government district was created under the Criccieth Improvement Act 1873, which also disbanded the old borough corporation, replacing it with an elected local board. Any residual claim Criccieth may have had to be called a borough was extinguished under the Municipal Corporations Act 1883.

Local government districts were converted into urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so the part of Criccieth parish outside the urban district became a separate parish called Penllyn. The urban district was extended in 1934 to take in parts of the neighbouring parishes of Penllyn and Treflys, and again in 1938 to take in part of Llanystumdwy.

Criccieth Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Criccieth was created instead, covering the area of the abolished urban district. District-level functions passed to Dwyfor District Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Gwynedd Council.

==Geography==

Criccieth is located in Eifionydd on the Cardigan Bay shore of the Llŷn Peninsula. The town is south facing and built around the rocky outcrop containing Criccieth Castle, which effectively divides the shoreline in two at this point. The East Shore has a sandy beach with a shallow area for bathing, whilst the Marine Beach, to the west, is quieter and has a number of hotels and guest houses.

The rhyolitic headland on which the castle is built is strong and not easily eroded. The cliffs to each side, however, are less resistant, being made up of glacial drift, layers of boulders, stones, clay and silt which were laid down during the last ice age. Sea walls were already in existence at the time of the first Ordnance Survey map in 1891, and the west shore sea wall had been extended and groynes built by 1913. Extensive remedial work was completed in 1965, and the defences were again strengthened in 1974 and 1985. In 1995 work was started on improving the defences along The Esplanade, followed in 1997 by further work to replace the crumbling gabions below Lôn Felin. Submerged forests occur in a number of places off the Cardigan Bay coastline, including Criccieth; these are deposits of peat, soil and tree remains and appear to be post-glacial coastal lagoons and estuaries, which have been flooded by rising sea levels.

The town has a temperate maritime climate which is influenced by the Gulf Stream. Frost and snow are rare; the last serious snowfall, of , was in 1985. The climate results in a luscious, green countryside and many delicate plant species grow wild; gorse flowers throughout the year. One plant unusual to Criccieth is &quot;Lampranthus multiradiatus&quot; (syn. &quot;Lampranthus roseus&quot;), known locally as the Oxenbould daisy and introduced in the late 19th century by a resident of Min-y-Mor.
==Demography==

At the 2001 Census, Criccieth had a population of 1,826, of which 62.76% were born in Wales, whilst 32.61% were born in England. 62.54% of households were owner occupied, and 25.30% were in rented accommodation.

==Economy==
In the 16th century, at the bottom of Lôn Felin stood the town&#x27;s mill, powered by water from a millpond near to the present level crossing and fed from the Afon Cwrt.

The herring industry was important by the 19th century, with horsedrawn carts converging on Abermarchnad to transport the catch to neighbouring villages. There was also a coal yard and other storehouses by the quay, where the Afon Cwrt enters the sea. Opposite stood a lime kiln, with lime produced both for local use and export, limestone for the kiln being unloaded from ships on the quay.

At the 2001 Census 54.18% of the population were in employment, whilst the unemployment rate stood at 3.81%. The proportion retired accounted for 22.99% of the inhabitants. Of those employed, 23.04% worked in the wholesale and retail trades and 19.86% in hotels and restaurants.

==Landmarks==
Criccieth Castle dominates the town, standing on a rock overlooking Cardigan Bay. Little survives of the original building, but the outer defences are still prominent. The inner bailey contains the earliest remains, including the inner gatehouse, which has two semi-circular towers. It is thought that the original living quarters were in the south west tower, overlooking the sea, and that the square north tower supported a catapult.

To the south of Y Maes stands Caffi Cwrt, an early 18th century detached stone house where the burgesses held court when rain prevented them meeting in their usual location on the bridge. The house has been owned by just two families since 1729. Two medieval strip fields to the rear, Llain Fawr (large strip) and Llain Bella (furthest strip), formed most of the smallholding of Cwrt but were lost when the railway was built. Nearby, where the slate shop now stands, was a smithy.
On Penpaled Road is a cottage, Penpaled, built in 1820 on a plot lying between two enclosed meadows. The meadows, Cae&#x27;r Beiliaid (bailiff&#x27;s field) and Llain y Beiliaid (bailiff&#x27;s strip) were subsequently to form part of the route of both the road and the railway.

Further uphill stand a 17th-century whitewashed cottage, Ty&#x27;r Felin, and Foinavon, a yellow pebble-dashed building once owned by the Bird&#x27;s Custard family.

Morfin, on Tan-y-Grisiau Terrace was used as an office by David Lloyd George whilst he was practising as a solicitor. Nearby, Ty Newydd, a mid-16th century house, was originally built to house the estate bailiff. Criccieth&#x27;s first council houses on the adjacent Henbont Road were built on land donated to rehouse families made homeless by the 1927 storm. Three 600-year-old cottages, originally thatched, make up Wellington Terrace. They are thought to be the oldest in the town.
Castle Road is within the original settlement, Yr Hen Dref, though most of the houses are Victorian. Ty Mawr, however, originally a smallholding and later a public house, dates from the 16th century, whilst on the opposite side of the street a long stone building, divided into three cottages, Porth yr Aur, Trefan and Cemlyn, dates from 1700. The Castle Bakery next door features a stained glass insertion above the shop window which depicts bakers at work. In the past nearby residents could bring their own dough to be baked in the ovens. By the castle entrance Gardd y Stocs, a small green, was home to the town&#x27;s stocks, whilst the building that houses the castle information centre was part of the town&#x27;s guildhall.

The heart of the old town is Y Dref. It was here that the weekly market was held, and it was also the venue for numerous political meetings.

Edward I granted lands north of the borough to the Bishop of Bangor, and it is thought that Gardd yr Esgob on Lôn Bach formed part of these. In the 19th century one of the town&#x27;s abattoirs stood here. Tan y Graig, a house at the end of a long garden, dates from at least 1800. Three 16th century fishermen&#x27;s cottages stand in Rock Terrace. Named Sea Winds, Ty Canol and Ty Isaf, they have 14th century foundations.

On the green at West Parade stands a shelter donated by Margaret Lloyd George, the wife of the former prime minister.
Muriau on Lôn Fel includes a group of partly 17th century farm buildings set around a square, which were converted into houses by Elizabeth Williams Ellis of Chwilog. Muriau Poethion contains an early spiral staircase going round a large inglenook fireplace. North of Pwllheli Road, several mansions are along the lane, now named Lôn Fel Uchaf. Parciau was once owned by Ellis Annwyl Owen, rector of Llanystumdwy from 1837 to 1846, whilst Parciau Mawr has a notable 19th century hay barn. Bryn Awelon was the home of David Lloyd George before the First World War, and later of his daughter Megan. Nearby, on Arfonia Terrace, is Parciau Uchaf, a farmhouse dating from 1829.

Y Gorlan on Caernarfon Road formed part of the small estate of Cefniwrch Bach, a hunting lodge for Edward I at the time the castle was being built, and is thought to have been a tannery in medieval times.

Ger y Maes, the end house on Holywell Terrace, is close to an ancient well, Ffynnon y Saint, which supplied much of the town&#x27;s water. The house had a spring inside a cupboard, and ginger beer was manufactured and sold. The house at the opposite end of the terrace was a dairy, and to the south are the ruins of the former animal pound, where stray animals were held before being sold.

The former National Westminster Bank on the High Street has step gables and is a duplicate of a building at Talgarth in Powys. On the south side of the street are a number of 19th century shops, including the Medical Hall, dating from 1875 and Siop Newydd, built in 1869.

At the eastern end of the Esplanade stands the Morannedd Café, built in 1954 by Clough Williams-Ellis.

Talhenbont Hall is a Grade II listed manor house. It was built in 1607 was once the home of William Vaughan. In 1642, the owner William Lloyd was arrested as a Royalist sympathiser as Cromwell&#x27;s men took over the hall. In 1758 Talhenbont was the largest single owned piece of land in the district of Eifionydd. The estate was occupied by Sir Thomas Mostyn, the sixth baronet, from 1796. In 1884 the estate was split into sections to pay off debts that had crept up during the Napoleonic Wars. It is now operated as a holiday centre.

==Lifeboat station==

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboat station stands on Lôn Felin and was built in 1853, although it was known as Porthmadoc Lifeboat Station until 1892. It was closed in 1931 but reopened in 1953. It operates an lifeboat but also has a smaller lifeboat which can get into shallower parts of the Glaslyn and Dwyryd estuaries than the larger boat can reach.

==Transport==

Criccieth lies on the A497, the main road running through the southern Llŷn Peninsula from Porthmadog to Pwllheli. The B4411 runs north from Criccieth to join the A487 near Garndolbenmaen, giving access to Caernarfon to the north.

The town is served by Criccieth railway station on the Cambrian Coast Line between Pwllheli and Machynlleth. Trains, operated by Transport for Wales, run through to Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton and Birmingham. The station, which is unstaffed, has been adopted by the local community which provides flower displays, and has engaged local artists to paint scenes of the town on the previously boarded up windows

Buses are operated by Caelloi Motors and Lloyds Coaches. Caelloi Motors, of Pwllheli, operate local service 3 from Pwllheli to Porthmadog. Lloyds Caches, of Machynlleth, operate TrawsCymru service T2 from Bangor to Aberystwyth via Caernarfon, Criccieth, Porthmadog, Dolgellau and Machynlleth.

==Education==
Primary education is provided by Ysgol Treferthyr on Lôn Bach, which has 131 pupils. At the last school inspection by Estyn, in 2010, 7% of pupils were entitled to free school meals and over half came from homes where Welsh was the main spoken language. Welsh is the main medium of teaching, and 94% of the pupils can speak Welsh. Secondary school pupils mainly attend Ysgol Eifionydd in Porthmadog.

==Culture==

Criccieth is a predominantly Welsh speaking community, with 64.2% of residents aged three and over being able to speak the language according to the 2011 Census.

The Memorial Hall, fronting Y Maes, is a venue for concerts, dramas and other community events and the main venue during the annual Criccieth Festival. It was designed by Morris Roberts of Porthmadog in a fusion of the art deco and arts and crafts architectural styles and completed in 1925, the foundation stone having been laid in 1922 by David Lloyd George.

The construction of Criccieth Library on the High Street was financed by Andrew Carnegie. A plaque inside the doorway commemorates local historian Colin Gresham. Among the services provided is free broadband access.

The National Eisteddfod was held in Criccieth in 1975, and a new housing estate, Gorseddfa marks the place where the Gorsedd stones then stood.

The Brynhir Arms on the High Street dates from 1631. Originally a single storey farm building, it was extended in 1840 to serve the new turnpike road.
The Lion Hotel, an old coaching inn, was built on Y Maes in 1731. It was here that the town&#x27;s councillors would retire after their meetings in Cwrt.

Several of the town&#x27;s hotels, including the Marine Hotel on Min-y-Mor and the Caerwylan Hotel on Min-y-Traeth, date from the period after Porthmadog&#x27;s new harbour was developed in 1811, when prosperous sea captains invested in properties where their wives could provide accommodation during the summer months.

An inn had reputedly existed on the site of the George IV Hotel in 1600, but the present building on the High Street dates from 1830, shortly after the turnpike opened. In the 1920s the hotel boasted that it generated its own electricity, and, for a fee, it offered a fire and private bath in guests&#x27; rooms. Servants could stay at reduced rates when accompanying their masters.

Clwb Cerdd Dwyfor stages performances at the Holiday Club Hall, ranging from traditional folk to opera and chamber music.

&quot;Côr Eifionydd&quot;, a mixed voice choir, was formed in 1986 to compete in the National Eisteddfod at Porthmadog the following year. Conducted by Pat Jones, originally from Newcastle Emlyn, the choir has won a number of first prizes at the National Eisteddfod. They have toured internationally and have sung in the &quot;International Choral Festival&quot; in Paris.

It used to be the custom, on Easter Sunday morning, for keys or pins to be thrown into Ffynnon Fair as an offering to Saint Catherine.

The town features in Welsh Incident, a humorous poem published in 1950 by Robert Graves, which tells of the mysterious creatures that supposedly, one Tuesday afternoon, &quot;... came out / From the sea caves of Criccieth yonder.&quot; It is also the subject of Shipwrecked Mariners, a painting by English Romantic landscape painter Joseph Mallord William Turner; the painting uses his sketch of Criccieth Castle but, although the rock is depicted correctly, the building is a mirror image.

There is a local legend that a piper named Dic, and two fiddlers named Twm and Ned, were once lured into a nearby cave by fairies. They were not seen again, but their music could still occasionally been heard coming from the cave.

==Religion==

Religion has been an important part of Criccieth&#x27;s life since early days, and around 1300 &quot;St Catherine&#x27;s Parish Church&quot; was built on what is thought to be the site of an early religious foundation. As the town developed so did the church, and in 1500 an extra nave was added. The church was restored in 1869 by Henry Kennedy and Gustavus O&#x27;Donoghue of Bangor It contains wooden panelling made from old box pews and a communion table dating from the 17th century. On the wall is a list of rectors stretching back to 1301. In the graveyard, the oldest stone commemorates the death in 1688 of Robert Ellis who was Groom of the Privy Chamber in Ordinarie to Catherine of Braganza, the wife of Charles II. Outside the west door is a sundial dating from 1734 with distances to ports in all directions.

In 1749 St Catherine&#x27;s was one of the buildings visited by Griffith Jones&#x27;s Circulating School. Out of a population of 600, 543 illiterates were taught to read so that they would be able to understand the Bible.
The nearby Rectory was built in 1831 by John Jones, son of the then rector Owen Jones, who had offered to have the house built if his son could succeed to the position. However, Erasmus Parry, rector from 1863 to 1884, was the first to officially live there.

St Deiniol&#x27;s Church was completed in 1887 by the Chester architects Douglas &amp; Fordham. Built as a chapel of ease for St Catherine&#x27;s, it was financed by the Greaves family for the use of English speaking visitors as services at the parish church were held in Welsh. It eventually closed in 1988, its pipe organ being transported to Sydney in Australia.

By the 19th century Wales was a predominantly nonconformist country, and this pattern was mirrored in Criccieth with the construction of a number of dissenting chapels. The Congregationalists had met on Castle Hill but 1886 saw the building of Jerusalem Congregational Chapel on Cambrian Terrace.
Capel Uchaf on Caernarfon Road was built in 1791 by the Scottish Baptists. In 1841 the congregation broke away to become Particular Baptists, followers of Alexander Campbell and the Disciples of Christ. David Lloyd George&#x27;s uncle often preached here and it was from the steps opposite, leading down into the Afon Cwrt, that the future prime minister was baptised. 1886 saw the Particular Baptists move to their new home at Berea on Tan-y-Grisiau Terrace, and in 1939 they joined the Mainstream Baptists.
The Calvinistic Methodists originally met at Tan y Graig on Lôn Fach but moved to Tal Sarnau, a house on the site of the Memorial Hall. From here they moved again, to a site on the High Street, rapidly outgrowing the small chapel. The neo-classical Capel Mawr was built on the same site in 1813. A second chapel, Capel y Traeth on Penpaled Road, with a notable porticoed facade, was built at a cost of £2,040 in 1895 by Owen Roberts of Porthmadog. Previously known as Capel Seion, it was renamed in 1995 when the congregation merged with that of Capel Mawr, reuniting the two congregations that had separated in 1889.

Salem Methodist Chapel was built on Salem Terrace in 1901. It is now a chapel of rest.

Roman Catholics worship at the Church of the Holy Spirit on Caernarfon Road, whilst Criccieth Family Church meets at the Holiday Club Hall on Lôn Ednyfed.

For over a hundred years community hymn singing has taken place on Sunday evenings on the small green at Abermarchnad, the site of the old market of the original fishing village.

At the 2001 census 82.19 per cent of the population claimed to be Christian, whilst 12.40 per cent stated that they had no religion.

==Sport==
Criccieth Tennis Club can claim to be one of the oldest clubs in existence today. It began in 1882 in the grounds of Parciau Mawr and transferred to its present site in 1884. It was first affiliated to the Lawn Tennis Association in 1896. Fifty-one open tournaments were held up to 1939, with players competing for the North Wales Championships. Notables who played here included John Boynton Priestley, the novelist, playwright and broadcaster; Frank Riseley who partnered Sydney Smith and won the Men&#x27;s Double Championship at Wimbledon in 1902 and 1906; his brother Bob Riseley who was on the Wimbledon Committee of Management for many years; Dodd and Mellet of South Africa; Dorothy Round Little who was Ladies&#x27; Singles Champion at Wimbledon in 1934 and 1937 and Mixed Doubles Champion in 1934, 1935 and 1936; Commander Philip Glover, Royal Navy champion; Thelma Cazalet-Keir, the Conservative feminist politician; Alan Davies; Duncan Macaulay, who was Secretary of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club from 1946 to 1963; and Megan Lloyd George, the Liberal Party&#x27;s Deputy Leader from 1949 to 1952.

Golf started in Criccieth with a few holes on Caerdyni Hill, but in 1906 Criccieth Golf Club opened. It was an undulating nine-hole course on natural terrain with views of the coast and the mountains of Snowdonia. The penultimate hole was a challenging par 4 with a green above the tee, whilst the finishing hole was just long with the green below the tee. The club holds the distinction of having three British prime ministers, Bonar Law, David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, play the course on the same day. It closed on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 2017.
The town is a popular venue for sea anglers. From the East Shore, bass, dogfish, mackerel and whiting can be caught. The Stone Jetty, in addition, is a good spot for conger, pollock and wrasse dabs, whilst bass, dogfish, mackerel, pollock and whiting can all also be found from the Marine Beach.

Criccieth, Llanystumdwy and District Angling Association, formed in 1927, controls the fishing rights on of the Afon Dwyfor and Afon Dwyfach. Each year between 2,000 and 3,000 sea trout and 30 to 40 salmon are caught; the association runs a hatchery where between 8,000 and 10,000 sea trout are reared annually. Gloddfa Lake, a disused quarry pool on Criccieth Golf Course, is a location for coarse fishing, with catches of rudd, roach and eels.

Bathing is popular, particularly on the East Shore, which is sandy and has a safe shallow area for children. At the eastern end is a rocky area with rock pools exposed at low tide. Graig Ddu (English: Black Rock) marks the boundary with Black Rock Sands. The Marine Beach to the west of the castle is pebbly. The water quality prediction is &quot;good&quot; and in 2009 both beaches were awarded a yellow flag seaside award.

Surfing is possible at all stages of the tide, but there is a fairly exposed beach break that does not work very often. It is particularly flat in summer. Most of the surf comes from groundswells and the best swell direction is from the southwest, the beach break providing left- and right-handers. Offshore winds blow from the north-northeast.

Crown green bowls is played at Criccieth Bowling Club, and there is a miniature golf course nearby.

<text>Predator 2 is a 1990 American science fiction action film written by brothers Jim and John Thomas, directed by Stephen Hopkins, and starring Danny Glover, Gary Busey, Rubén Blades, María Conchita Alonso, Bill Paxton, and Kevin Peter Hall. It is the second installment of the &quot;Predator&quot; franchise, and sequel to 1987&#x27;s &quot;Predator&quot;, with Kevin Peter Hall reprising the title role of the Predator.

Set ten years after the events of the first film, in Los Angeles, &quot;Predator 2&quot; focuses on a disgruntled police officer and his allies battling a malevolent and technologically-advanced extraterrestrial known as the Predator.

Upon release, the film received generally negative reviews and earned a moderate box office return, grossing $57 million worldwide, compared to the previous film&#x27;s $98 million gross on a smaller production budget. The film has been viewed more positively over time, especially for Danny Glover&#x27;s performance, the direction, and the musical score, and has gained a cult following in the decades since its initial release.

==Plot==

In 1997, Los Angeles is experiencing a heat wave and a turf war between heavily armed Colombian and Jamaican drug cartels. A Predator watches a shootout between the police, Jamaicans, and Colombians, observing as Lieutenant Michael R. Harrigan charges into the firefight to rescue two wounded officers and drive the Colombians back into their hideout. The Predator assaults the Colombians, causing a disturbance that prompts Harrigan and detectives Leona Cantrell and Danny Archuleta to defy orders and enter the hideout, where they find the slaughtered Colombians. On the roof, Harrigan shoots the crazed gang leader and catches a glimpse of the camouflaged Predator, but dismisses it as a mirage due to extreme heat and his acrophobia.

At the station, his superiors reprimand Harrigan for his disobedience. He is then introduced to Special Agent Peter Keyes, the leader of a task force investigating the cartels, and Detective Jerry Lambert, the newest member of Harrigan&#x27;s team.

Later that evening, Jamaicans invade the Colombian drug lord&#x27;s penthouse and murder him before they are killed in turn by the Predator. Upon their arrival, Harrigan&#x27;s team notes the similarities between the crime scene and the earlier Colombian massacre, including the flayed corpses, until Keyes&#x27;s team arrives and removes them.

Archuleta returns alone, finding one of the Predator&#x27;s spear tips before the creature kills him. As an enraged Harrigan vows to stop Archuleta&#x27;s killer, forensic analysis reveals the spear tip is not composed of any known element on the periodic table. Seeking answers, Harrigan meets with Jamaican drug lord King Willie, a voodoo practitioner who believes the killer is supernatural and that he should prepare himself for battle against it. Harrigan leaves before the Predator kills King Willie, taking his head as a trophy. Tracing a lead indicating Archuleta&#x27;s killer had recently been in a slaughterhouse, Harrigan arranges to meet his team at the warehouse district to investigate.

Cantrell and Lambert take the subway there, but are ambushed by the Predator, who kills Lambert and numerous armed passengers but spares Cantrell after its helmet&#x27;s scanners indicate that she is pregnant. Arriving in time to see it claim Lambert&#x27;s head, Harrigan chases the fleeing Predator, but Keyes&#x27;s men intercept him. Keyes reveals that the monster is an extraterrestrial hunter with infrared vision and active camouflage that has been hunting humans for sport, most recently one decade prior in Central America. Keyes and his team have set a trap in a nearby slaughterhouse, using thermally insulated suits with mounted ultraviolet lights and cryogenic weapons to capture it for study. However, the suspicious Predator, upon hearing step sounds, uses its scanners to track, outmaneuver, and slaughter Keyes&#x27;s men via their lights.

Harrigan attacks and wounds the Predator, but it destroys his weapon. It nearly kills him before Keyes tries to freeze the creature, the Predator throws a Smart Disc to bisect him. The Predator chases Harrigan to the roof, where they clash until they are left hanging from a ledge. The creature activates a self-destruct device on its forearm, which Harrigan severs with the disc, disarming it.

The Predator enters an apartment, where it treats its wounds and flees. Harrigan pursues it to a spacecraft hidden underground and engages it in combat, eventually killing the Predator with its disc.

Suddenly, a group of Predators, which remained hidden, emerge to collect their dead comrade. Their leader, an elder Predator, gives Harrigan an antique flintlock pistol as a trophy. As the ship takes off, Harrigan escapes to the surface and meets with Keyes&#x27;s team. Despite their lost opportunity to capture the creature, Harrigan privately muses that the Predators will return.

==Cast==

Elpidia Carrillo reprises her role as Anna Gonsalves from the first film in a cameo appearance. She aids government agents in a videotape, showing the devastating after-effects of the first Predator&#x27;s self-destruct device to the U.S. Army. Carrillo filmed an additional scene in which she talks to the camera and describes the events of the first film, but this scene was cut.

==Production==
Once 20th Century Fox approached &quot;Predator&quot; screenwriters Jim and John Thomas to write a sequel, they pitched six ideas, one of which was &quot;putting the creature in an urban jungle&quot;, which the studio liked. The eventual setting was Los Angeles, blighted by gang warfare during a severe heat wave, creating the ideal &quot;hot spot&quot; in which the Predator hunts targets. The script was then developed in just three weeks. A goal of the sequel was to expand on the Predator&#x27;s origins and motives, showing the creature has been visiting the planet for centuries, is not psychopathic, but just interested in hunting, and exploring its spacecraft&#x27;s interior.

Producer Joel Silver invited director Stephen Hopkins, who drew his interest while directing &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child&quot;. As Hopkins joined production before the screenplay was finished, he worked closely with the Thomases in the script revisions and storyboarding the sequences they had written. For the lead role of LAPD police officer Harrigan, Hopkins had originally envisioned Patrick Swayze playing the role, teaming up with a returning Arnold Schwarzenegger, who starred as Dutch in the first film. Hopkins also met with Steven Seagal for the role; although the actor was interested in starring in the film and had his own ideas about the character, wanting to portray him as a CIA psychiatrist and martial arts expert, Hopkins ultimately decided against it, as he wanted the character to be an average Joe type. Due to a dispute over salary, Schwarzenegger declined to return to the sequel, and Silver brought in three actors he had worked with in &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot;: Gary Busey, Steve Kahan, and Danny Glover in the role of Harrigan. Production was split between location shooting, mostly at night, and soundstage filming.

The main Predator was designed to look more urban and hip than its predecessor. Design changes included tribal ornamentation on the forehead, which is steeper and shallower, brighter skin coloration, and a greater number of fangs. Describing the new Predator&#x27;s design, Stan Winston said, &quot;Broad concept&#x27;s the same. The difference is, this is a different individual. A different individual of the same species. As in a snake is a snake, but different snakes are different. Their colorings are different, different parts of their characteristics, their facial structures, subtle differences.&quot; Production designer Lawrence Paull said that with the Predator ship, he attempted &quot;a space vehicle unlike anything that had ever been designed before&quot;, a snail-shaped vessel whose interior was &quot;both technological and reptilian, where the creature and its ship blend and work together&quot;. Given the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise is also by Fox with effects work by Winston, the crew added an Xenomorph head among the trophy skulls in the Predator ship.

&quot;Predator 2&quot; is set ten years after the original, which was the then-future of 1997, leading to some developments like new video technology and a nonexistent subway in Los Angeles. (The Los Angeles Metro Rail started operating the same year as the film&#x27;s release.) For the set design, Paul aimed for a &quot;kind of retrograde future that&#x27;s equal parts &quot;Brazil&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; mixed in with modern-day technology&quot;, with &quot;big and outrageous&quot; structures but simpler prop design, such as boxy and colorless cars.

The MPAA initially gave &quot;Predator 2&quot; an NC-17 rating, so several cuts were made to bring it down to an R rating.

Toward the end of filming, a short unofficial music video was made, with Danny Glover dancing with the Predator and others.

==Music==

Alan Silvestri returned to score the sequel, conducting the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra. Whereas the first film did not have its music released until years later, a soundtrack album for the sequel was issued on December 13, 1990, from Varèse Sarabande. On December 1, 2014, the label issued &quot;Predator 2: The Deluxe Edition&quot;.

==Release==
===Home media===
&quot;Predator 2&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc in 1991, on DVD in 2003, a two-disc special edition in January 2005, on Blu-ray on June 9, 2009, in North America, and 4K UHD Blu-Ray on August 7, 2018.

==Reception==
===Box office===
Released on November 21, 1990, &quot;Predator 2&quot; was #4 at the US box office in its opening weekend, with a gross of over $8 million behind the films &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, &quot;Three Men and a Little Lady&quot;, &quot;Rocky V&quot;, and Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s own film &quot;Home Alone&quot;. The film grossed a total of $57 million, $30 million of which was from the United States. The worldwide box office revenue totaled $57,120,318 in ticket sales. The film became the lowest-grossing film in the &quot;Predator&quot; franchise.

===Critical response===

In 1990, the film&#x27;s reviews were generally negative, though reviewers were generally impressed by the casting of Danny Glover as an action hero. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 29% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;The thrill of the hunt is gone in this hackneyed sequel.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 46 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The reviewers for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; were split: Rita Kempley enjoyed the film, saying that it had &quot;the dismal irony of &quot;RoboCop&quot; and the brooding fatalism of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;&quot;, and that Glover &quot;brings an unusual depth to the action-adventure and proves fiercely effective as the Predator&#x27;s new nemesis&quot;. Desson Howe said the film was &quot;blithely unoriginal&quot; and numbingly violent, but also praised Glover&#x27;s ability to bring warmth to the center of a cold film.

In her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin called the film &quot;an unbeatable contender&quot; for the &quot;most mindless, mean-spirited action film of the holiday season&quot;. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert, in giving the film two out of four stars, suggested that it represents an &quot;angry and ugly&quot; dream. He said that the creatures&#x27; design had racist undertones where &quot;subliminal clues [...] encourage us to subconsciously connect the menace with black males&quot;.

===Legacy===

Several retrospective reviews have considered the film underrated, and it has gained a cult following.

Later, director Stephen Hopkins said: &quot;It&#x27;s so over the top. I just sort of went for it and made the biggest, boldest, loudest movie I could make. I was only 29 years old – I was like a rampant child, running around Los Angeles, blowing the shit out of everything and making things as bloody as possible.&quot; About the modest reception at the box office and the cult status since its release, he added &quot;It had a big initial opening weekend if I remember correctly – but I think many people were disappointed that Arnold wasn’t in it. A lot of people like the film and some prefer it to the original – just because it’s in a city and more contemporary.&quot;

Danny Glover was proud of his performance, saying:
I have two films I’ve done that I feel that I was bigger than life in, in which I felt that I could control the space. &quot;Silverado&quot; for me, and &quot;Predator 2&quot;. In &quot;Predator 2&quot;, it was like &#x27;who&#x27;s the baddest cat in your space, and the baddest cat says &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna challenge you.&#x27; Mano y mano. I was the baddest guy in his space. What happens? I kill him, and then the others come around, and I’m like &#x27;alright... who&#x27;s next?&#x27; I was about 42, 43.. in the best shape in my life, best shape I’ve been in. I was running on the beach, had my training, I was lifting weights a lot more than I am now. I was really feeling it in that movie.

==Other media==
A third main film titled &quot;Predators&quot; was released in 2010. A fourth, &quot;The Predator&quot; was released in 2018, which is set between the events of &quot;Predator 2&quot; and &quot;Predators&quot;. A prequel titled &quot;Prey&quot; was released in 2022, which takes place in 1719.

A novelization written by Simon Hawke was released on December 1, 1990, by the publishing company Jove. It briefly covers the fate of Dutch from the first film. Keyes recalls memories of speaking with the battered Major while infirmed in a hospital, suffering from radiation sickness. Dutch is said to have escaped from the hospital, never to be seen again. It tells a great deal of the story from the Predator&#x27;s point of view, such as its humiliation of having its mask removed by Harrigan and its reasoning for not killing Cantrell due to its discovery of her pregnancy.

The film was adapted as two video games: the first for computer in 1990 and the second for Sega Genesis in 1992.

<text>Pwllheli ( ; ) is a market town and community on the Llŷn Peninsula (), in Gwynedd, north-west Wales. It had a population of 4,076 in 2011, which declined slightly to 3,947 in 2021; a large proportion (81%) were Welsh speaking. Pwllheli is the place where Plaid Cymru was founded. It is the birthplace of the Welsh poet Sir Albert Evans-Jones (bardic name ).

Pwllheli has a range of shops and other services. As a local railhead with a market every Wednesday, the town is a gathering point for the peninsula&#x27;s population.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name means &#x27;salt-water pool&#x27;.

==History==
The town was given its charter as a borough by Edward, the Black Prince in 1355; a market is still held each Wednesday in the centre of the town on &quot;Y Maes&quot; (‘the field’ or ‘the town square’ in English).

The town grew around the shipbuilding and fishing industries and the granite quarry at Gimlet Rock ().

The population in 1841 was 2,367.

During the 1890s, the town was developed by Solomon Andrews, a Cardiff businessman. This work included the promenade, roads and houses at West End. The Pwllheli and Llanbedrog Tramway was built, linking the town to Llanbedrog. The trams ran until 1927, when the section of track between Carreg-y-Defaid and Tyddyn-Caled was seriously damaged by a storm. Andrews ran the Cardiff Road section in 1928 and offered to sell the tramway to Pwllheli Corporation at the end of the season, but they did not take up his offer. He then sold the assets and the Corporation removed the tracks during the winter of 1928/29.
Poet Albert Evans-Jones, who was an archdruid for the National Eisteddfod of Wales and was known by his bardic name , was born in Pwllheli. Before becoming an archdruid, he joined the First World War effort through the Welsh Student Company of the RAMC, serving in Salonika and France, initially as an ambulance driver and medic, later as the company&#x27;s chaplain. He was the son of the proprietor of the Central Restaurant in Penlan Street, Pwllheli.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Pwllheli, at community (town) and county level, with both councils using Welsh as their primary language: (&#x27;Pwllheli Town Council&#x27;) and (&#x27;Gwynedd Council&#x27;). The town council is based at the Old Town Hall at 9 Penlan Street.

===Administrative history===
Pwllheli formed part of the ancient parish of Denio (or Deneio). It also was part of the medieval cantref of Llŷn, which in 1284 was made part of the new county of Caernarfonshire under the Statute of Rhuddlan. Pwllheli was made a borough in 1355 under a charter from Edward the Black Prince. The borough covered the same area as the parish of Denio. The borough was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.

The borough of Pwllheli was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. A community called Pwllheli was created instead, covering the area of the abolished borough. District-level functions passed to Dwyfor District Council, which was in turn replaced in 1996 by Gwynedd Council.

==Education==
 is the town&#x27;s primary school.

 was formed in 1969 by the merger of the former Pwllheli Grammar School at Penrallt and the Frondeg Secondary Modern School in Upper Ala Road to form a comprehensive school based on two sites in the town. The junior pupils (year 1 and year 2) were located at the Penrallt site and the senior pupils (year 3 and upwards) at a new complex in Cardiff Road. This new school was subsequently expanded to accommodate all pupils under the name.

The Penrallt site was later redeveloped as the Pwllheli campus of . The façade of the main building of the old grammar school was retained and incorporated into the design of the current college buildings. Thus the &#x27;old school&#x27; is readily seen from the town square (), as it has been since the former Pwllheli County School moved to Penrallt in the early 20th century.

==Transport==
Pwllheli railway station is the north-western terminus of the Cambrian Coast Line, which provides services to ; most trains continue on to and . Services are operated by Transport for Wales.

The railway line to , via the Carnarvonshire Railway, was axed under the Beeching cuts and it closed in December 1964.

Pwllheli is connected to the wider road network by the A497 to Porthmadog and the A499 to Caernarfon. From there, major roads lead away from Gwynedd to the rest of Wales.

Bus services on the Llŷn Peninsula are operated by Berwyn Coaches and Nefyn. Routes connect the town with Aberdaron, Caernarfon, Nefyn and Rhydlios. Pwllheli bus station is sited in the town centre.

==Attractions==

=== Pwllheli Harbour and Hafan Pwllheli ===

Pwllheli has a small harbour at the confluence of the Afon Erch and Afon Rhyd-Hir.

&quot;Hafan Pwllheli&quot; is a marina built in Pwllheli Harbour during the 1990s.

==Arts==
Pwllheli hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1925, 1955 and 2023, as well as an unofficial National Eisteddfod event in 1875.

==Language==
According to the 2011 Census, 80% of the population spoke Welsh.

==Sport and leisure==
Pwllheli is home to association football team Pwllheli F.C., rugby union team Pwllheli RFC and running club Llŷn Striders. There is a hockey club, .

It is a hub for water sports, owing in part to a marina; Pwllheli Sailing Club and (the Welsh National Sailing Academy) are based here.

The town has two beaches, South Beach and Glan-y-don. South Beach stretches from Gimlet Rock, across the Promenade and West End, towards Penrhos and Llanbedrog. Glan-y-don Beach is on the eastern side of the river mouth and runs for 3 miles (5 km) from behind the marina workshops and out towards Penychain (holiday camp).

The town has a golf club on the Llŷn coastline.

<doc id="620038" wikidata="Q389020" url="?curid=620038" title="Audi 80">
<text>The Audi 80 is a compact executive car produced by the Audi subdivision of the Volkswagen Group across four generations from 1966 to 1996. It shared its platform with the Volkswagen Passat from 1973 to 1986 and was available as a saloon, and station wagon — the latter marketed by Audi as the Avant. The coupé and convertible models were not badged as members of the range, but used a derivative of the same platforms.

In North America and Australia, the 80 was marketed as the Audi Fox for model years 1973–1979, as the Audi 4000 for model years 1980–1987 in the US, as Audi 4000 5+5 from 1981 in the US, and Audi 5+5 in Australia during 1981 through 1983. 

The Audi 90 was an upmarket version of the Audi 80, although all North American sedans of the B4 generation were called Audi 90.

== Naming convention ==
Under Audi&#x27;s platform numbering convention, the 80 is classified as a member of the &quot;B-series&quot; or &quot;B platform&quot; family of vehicles, with the four generations of 80 being numbered as B1, B2, B3, and B4; its replacement – the Audi A4 – continues this sequence with platform numbers B5 through to B9. Originally this numbering convention ran concurrently with that of the Volkswagen Passat, the first generation of which was essentially a badge engineered clone of the Audi 80. This link was severed in 1988 when the Passat moved to a transverse-engined, VW-specific platform for its 80-unrelated B3 and B4 versions. The Passat was based again on the Audi A4 (B5 or &quot;8D&quot; platform) for its B5 generation, and returned to a transverse engine for the B6 and later generations.

== F103 (1966–1972) ==

The Audi F103 series, based on the DKW F102 but with an all-new range of four-stroke engines developed in conjunction with Daimler-Benz, was sold between 1965 and 1972. It comprised several models named for their horsepower ratings. From 1966 to 1969 this series included an Audi 80, and there were also Audi 60, 72, 75, and Super 90 models available over the years.

== B1 (1972–1978) ==


This model debuted in Europe in 1972 as the Audi 80, and in 1973 in Australia and North America (Canada and the USA) as the Audi Fox, and was available as either a two-door or a four-door saloon (sedan). It effectively took the place of several models that Audi had discontinued (the F103 series, which included the first model designated as an &quot;Audi 80&quot;), and provided the company with a viable rival to the Opel Ascona and the Ford Taunus (Ford Cortina in the UK), as well as more upmarket offerings including the Alfa Romeo Alfetta and Triumph Dolomite.

The Audi 80 B1 was only the second modern-era Audi product to be developed entirely under Volkswagen ownership - Audi chief engineer Ludwig Kraus had famously been disparaging about the outgoing F103 series, referring to it as the &quot;bastard&quot;, owing to its Auto Union/DKW bodyshell and Mercedes-Benz engine. The B1 was a clean break from the Auto Union era, being equipped with a range of brand new 1.3- and 1.5-litre SOHC inline-four petrol engines - the first appearance of the now legendary &quot;EA827&quot; series of engines, whose descendants are still used in VW Group vehicles to the present day. The internal combustion engines were available in various rated power outputs. For the 1.3-litre engines, (identification code: ZA) was rated at , code: ZF was rated at . The 1.5-litre (codes: ZB, ZC) at for the ZB and for the ZC.

On the home market, two-door and four-door saloons were available in base trim (55 or 60 PS, called simply Audi 80 and 80 S, respectively), as L models (LS with 75 PS engine) or as a more luxurious GL (85 PS only). In September 1973, Audi added the sporty 80 GT (two-door only) featuring a carburettor 1.6-litre engine (code: XX) rated at .

The Audi 80 had a MacPherson strut front suspension, and a C-section beam rear axle located by trailing arms and a Panhard rod, and using coil springs and telescopic dampers.

Audi&#x27;s design and development efforts paid off during the 1973 European Car of the Year competition where the 80 won ahead of the Renault 5 and the Alfa Romeo Alfetta.

A facelift in autumn 1976 brought about a revised front end in the style of the newly introduced Audi 100 C2 with square instead of round headlights, 1.6- instead of 1.5-litre engines (still of 75/85 PS) and a new 80 GTE model with a fuel-injected version of the 1.6-litre () replacing the former 80 GT.

In certain markets a five-door &quot;Avant&quot; (Audi&#x27;s name for an estate/wagon) variant was offered — effectively a rebadged Volkswagen Passat with Audi front panels. This version, first seen in mid-1975, appeared in the United States, South Africa, and several other markets.

The Fox originally had a 1.5 litre engine rated at , attached to a four-speed manual transmission. Subsequent versions came with 1.6-litre engines rated at . By 1978, ever more stringent emissions rules meant that this had dropped to . Four-speed manuals or three-speed automatics were on offer, in all three bodystyles. Aside from the required larger bumpers, early models looked very similar to their European counterparts, while facelift versions (model year 1977) received a large black grille with double, round headlights, without the wraparound turn signals used elsewhere. There was also a sporting GTi package on offer in later years. The B1 platform was dropped from the European market in 1978, although it was sold into the 1979 model year in North America.
== B2 (1978–1986) ==

Audi presented a redesigned 80 based on the B2 platform (&quot;Typ&quot; 81) in September 1978 and deliveries of the four-door sedan began a few weeks later in Europe. Deliveries of the fuel injected GLE and two-door bodied cars began early in 1979. The redesigned car was first seen in North America in 1979 (as a 1980 model). Audi continued to use the 80 nameplate in Europe, but badged their &quot;Typ&quot; 81 as the Audi 4000 in North America. The body of the B2 Audi 80 was designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro. No Avant variant was available, as the Volkswagen Passat filled that role, as the B2 was intended to move the 80 upmarket from the mid-sized family segment to a compact executive model pitched to rival the BMW 3 Series. The B2 also acted in a de facto sense, as a replacement for the ill-fated NSU Ro 80 that ceased production the year before, since Audi dropped the NSU brand completely following that car&#x27;s demise. The corresponding B2 version of the Passat appeared two years later and, although the two cars shared the same platform and running gear as before, the Passat had a much stronger visual identity distinct from its Audi 80 sister in comparison with the B1.

The 80 first became available with four-wheel drive in 1983. The model was essentially an Ur-Quattro without the turbocharger and with saloon bodywork. The four-wheel drive 80, however, weighed more than a front-wheel drive Audi 100 CD with the same 2144 cc engine, and with its worse aerodynamics it was slower than the larger, better-equipped, and lower-priced 100. Top speeds are respectively, with similar fuel economy advantages for the larger 100. The 80 quattro received twin headlamps, a front spoiler with integrated foglights, and a body-coloured rubber spoiler on the rear. There was also a &quot;quattro&quot; script on the bootlid and a twin exhaust. The luggage compartment was marginally smaller (mostly in height), which meant only a temporary spare tire could be fitted. The 80 quattro was a bargain compared to the Ur-Quattro, but less so in comparison with the two-wheel drive 80 GTE or the 100 CD, although they did not offer the impressive road holding that the quattros do.
In Europe, the 80 was the standard model, while after a 1984 facelift the Audi 90 was launched as a larger-engined version of the 80; with more options, and, aside from the , four-cylinder 1.6-litre turbodiesel (TD) engine which was also available for the 80, two five-cylinder in-line petrol engines — a 2.0-litre with and a 2.2-litre with which was later enlarged into a 2.3-litre. The 2.2-litre was available with a catalytic converter and power ratings of for front-drive and for quattro models. European models had two headlamp casings, while North American models generally had quad headlamps.

In 1983, the 80 Sport was introduced in the UK, based on the GTE. It came with quattro-style Ronal alloys, rubber rear spoiler, deep chin spoiler, striped charcoal Recaro interior, and optional body graphics including full-length &quot;Audi Sport&quot; stripes.

=== 1984 facelift ===


In Mid-1984 for the 1985 model year, Audi gave the B2 a subtle facelift with tail lights resembling the ones of the &quot;Typ&quot; 44 Audi 100, and different front and rear bumpers and headlights and an updated interior. In Europe, engines with catalytic converter emissions controls were made available for the first time. The 1.6- and 1.8-litre engines were replaced by newer iterations of the same, enabling the fitment of catalytic converters.

The B2 platform proved to be both quite versatile and quite profitable; many components were shared to or borrowed from the Audi Coupé, Audi Quattro, and Audi Sport Quattro, which in the process helped to cement the company into the public eye after their quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system proved useful in various forms of racing.

The saloons were offered until late 1986 in Europe and 1987 abroad, and the B2-based Audi Coupé lasted through to 1988 (as an early 1989 model) before being changed. The Coupé shared many components, and its basic body shape, with the original Audi Quattro.

== 4000 ==

=== 4000 (North America)===
The North American Audi 4000 was first introduced for the 1980 model year, with a 1588 cc inline-four with . This engine came in for some criticism, being somewhat buzzy and underpowered for a car in this price segment. Audi did not offer an automatic transmission, as the engine could not quite cope. A five-speed transmission was also not available until the 1981 model year. For 1981, the 4000 received a long-stroke 1.7-litre engine and a standard five-speed manual (with a three-speed automatic still available). The new engine was a fifty-state version with a three-way catalyst, and power dropped to . Nonetheless, more torque and the new gearbox translated into better performance and improved gas mileage.

==== Audi 4000 5+5 (North America) ====
The Audi 4000 5+5 was launched onto the American market in the 1981 model year. The 5+5 was essentially an 80 B2 two-door saloon with the 2144 cc five-cylinder engine from the 5000 and a five-speed transmission. 

The 4000 5+5 was the precursor to what would become the Audi 90. It was fitted with various sporty parts such as an oil pressure gauge, sports interior, and alloy wheels as standard equipment.

==== Audi 5+5 (Australia) ====
The Audi 5+5 name was used in the Australian market for a unique four-door Audi 80, so named as it was fitted with the 2144-cc, five-cylinder engine coupled with a five-speed manual gearbox. An automatic option was also offered. The 5+5 was marketed in Australia from October 1981 through to 1983.

==== Audi 4000S ====
The 4000 5+5 was accompanied on the American market by the 4000S. This is a more pedestrian yet well-equipped four-door version with the same engine, originally only coupled to a three-speed automatic.

After a facelift it was sold in North America in 4000S (1.8-litre) and 4000S/CS quattro (2.2-litre) derivatives, with the S and CS quattros corresponding to the European Audi 90 quattro. The Audi 4000 quattro debuted in 1984 and was sold in four colors, Black, Alpine White, Tornado Red, and optional Zermatt Silver metallic. It came standard with a five-speed manual transmission, brown velour interior, and automatic windows up front and manuals in the rear. The early Audi 4000 models were very similar to the Audi 80 with the addition of USA mandated crash safety bumpers and quad sealed beam headlights. The mounting for the safety bumpers intruded into the luggage compartment floor, making for a very irregularly shaped and less useful space.

The S has a 1.8-litre inline-four-cylinder engine that puts out at 5500 rpm. The CS quattro has a CIS-E fuel-injected 2.2-litre inline-five cylinder petrol engine (identification code: JT). It displaces 2226 cc and was constructed from a grey cast-iron cylinder block, with an aluminium alloy cylinder head, and uses a timing belt-driven single overhead camshaft (SOHC). The rated horsepower is at 5500 rpm, and the torque is at 3000 rpm. The only transmission available on the 4000CS was a five-speed close-ratio manual.

== B3 (1986–1992) ==
In September 1986, Audi released a new &quot;Typ&quot; 89 Audi 80 for the 1987 model year on the European market and introduced it elsewhere within a year. It was based on a new platform that broke the relationship between the 80 and the Volkswagen Passat, the corresponding third generation of which used the transverse-engined Volkswagen B3 platform, whilst Audi stuck with the longitudinal front wheel drive layout for the B3-series 80. Production codes were &quot;Typ&quot; 89 from 1987 to 1989, and &quot;Typ&quot; 8A from 1990 onward (in line with a restructuring of many VW platform designations). It introduced a new aerodynamic look and a fully zinc-coated galvanised bodyshell.

Unlike its predecessor, the B3 was marketed worldwide only as the Audi 80 or Audi 90. Initially, Audi transferred existing powertrain concepts to the new model although fuel injection was now available for some engines. A range of new petrol and diesel inline four-cylinder engines became available to European customers along with the &quot;procon-ten&quot; safety system which became standard fitment from 1991.

Procon-ten was a notable safety feature comprising a series of hidden steel cables routed behind the gearbox, attached to the steering wheel and front seatbelt inertia reels. In the event of a front impact, the engine and gearbox are forced rearward, pulling on these cables. This action simultaneously pulls the steering wheel into the dashboard to prevent the driver colliding with it while tightening the front seatbelts. This innovation was a precursor to the airbag, which became popular on mass produced cars during the 1990s after being patented by Mercedes-Benz in 1982.

In 1987, the Audi 90 was reintroduced as an upmarket, more luxurious variant of the 80. To begin with it would again feature a choice of 10-valve inline five-cylinder petrol engines, and could be specified with or without quattro. The 90 differs visually from the 80 by a full width tail-light panel; headlights that featured additional high-beam lights and a slightly different front grille. Indicator lamps were moved from beside the headlights to the bumpers next to the fog lights, which were standard fitment on the 90. Brightwork surrounds for the windows, tops of the bumpers and side rubbing strips were also standard. Interiors were upgraded over the 80 featuring velour seat coverings and a slightly more generous level of equipment. The then range-topping 2.2E offered a boot spoiler, alloy wheels, leather steering wheel, and sports front seats. Switchable ABS was standard on quattro versions.

From 1989 to 1991 the Audi 90 offered the first 20-valve engine from Audi since the turbocharged engine used in the Audi Sport Quattro. This new 2.3-litre engine produced and featured in the front wheel drive 20V, 20V Sport, and four-wheel drive 20V quattro derivatives. The non-quattro 20V models were 120 kg lighter. The Audi 80 16V, new in 1990, was also offered with the quattro system, making for a certain amount of overlap with the 2.3-liter Audi 90. The quattro 16V was built in comparably small numbers, meaning that it did not reach the initial annual production requirement of 5,000 examples required to be homologated for Group A rallying.

Externally, Sport versions of the 90 were visually distinguished by the deletion of brightwork in favour of satin black window surrounds, bumper cappings, and thinner side mouldings. A raised aluminium boot spoiler, lowered suspension, and uprated brakes were fitted as standard, Speedline wheels were also standard fitment in the UK.

In October 1988, a Coupé version based on the 80/90 appeared, called simply the Audi Coupé (&quot;typ 8B&quot;). This had completely different three-door liftback bodywork and replaced the earlier, B2-based Coupé which had been manufactured into early 1988. This version remained in production until 1996, in parallel with the succeeding B4 generation Audi 80. A convertible was planned from the beginning, but did not appear until May 1991 as the Audi Cabriolet. This model remained in production until 2000 and was optically aligned with the B4 Audi 80 from its introduction.

Altogether, the Audi 80 came with the following engine range, although not all of these were available in all markets:
The Audi 90 came with the following engines:
=== North America ===
In 1989, for the 1990 model year, North America received the 90 quattro model (and Coupé quattro) that was powered by a detuned of the 20v 2.3-litre 5-cylinder engine. It was marketed in the &quot;Grand Tourismo&quot; (GT) style of a comfortable luxury car with sporting tendencies, as opposed to a dedicated lightweight sports car. Weighing between (1990 sedan model) to (1991 Coupé model), these cars were not lightweight, especially in consideration of the 164 hp powerplant (slightly less than the European version). These models can be recognised by their distinctive wheels, 14&quot; BBS Mesh wheels or 15&quot; Six-star Speedlines. They differed from regular 80/90 models in several ways. Notable differences include their standard leather interiors with Zebrano wood trim, additional VDO gauges mounted in the bottom of the centre console, a carbon fibre centre prop shaft, and push-button locking rear differential.

The final type 89 80s and 90s were sold as 1992 models in North America; in Europe, all type 89 sedans were discontinued at the end of the 1991 model year to give way to the B4 series; a few Audi 90 Sport Quattro with the 2.3-litre 20v engine were assembled in early 1992.

== B4 (1991–1996) ==


The Audi 80 (B3) obtained a major facelift in the autumn of 1991, although the UK launch was not until early 1992. From then on it was known internally as the B4 (or &quot;Typ&quot; 8C). Changes from the B3 included a longer wheelbase, a fully redesigned fuel tank and rear axle to enable the use of folding seats, 15&quot; wheels with more prominent wheel arches, redesigned and painted rear and front bumpers, as well as higher-quality materials for the interior, and a larger boot. The front grille was merged with the bonnet and given a bolder look. This design had been previewed on the 1990 Audi Coupé S2 and was applied to the full lineup of the B3-based Coupés as well in July 1991. The Cabriolet (&quot;Typ&quot; 8G) had been introduced in May 1991 and continued to be built long after the B4 had been replaced, receiving similar updates to the Audi 80 B4 and succeeding Audi A4.

The B4 also marked the beginning of Audi&#x27;s move into the German luxury mid-sized vehicle segment, which until then was clearly dominated by Mercedes-Benz and BMW. On the European market, and in Germany in particular, the B4 and its variants were highly successful and popular.

In Europe, the 90 designation for five-cylinder models was dropped for this generation, and all saloons were badged as 80, regardless of which engine they had. Audi of America went the opposite direction, and sold the saloon as the 90. B4s for the American market typically offered more luxury and style even in the standard version, such as automatic transmission, cruise control, air conditioning, and leather seats, all of which were usually optional at additional cost on European models.

Because the United States does not recognise the international ECE Regulations on auto safety components and constructions, but rather maintains its own Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, the front of the B4 had to be specially redesigned for vehicles sold in North America. The front and bumper had to be designed to accommodate impact energy absorbers not required outside North America. Instead of the dual-reflector headlamps, a single-reflector design was used inboard of an amber combination turn signal, parking, and side marker lamp and reflector wrapping around the corner, and fog lamps smaller than the rest-of-world items were placed the corners of the bumper air duct.

European market cars were now available with a selection of inline four-cylinder engines, as well as the familiar in-line five, and two different new V6 engines (2.6-litre and 2.8-litre); the later 2.8-litre V6 was the only engine available for vehicles sold in North America. As another first, Audi introduced a new high-torque, direct-injection, turbocharged diesel engine, the 1.9-litre TDI (Turbocharged Direct Injection). The standard 1.8-litre petrol engine of the B3 was discontinued; a two-litre, , four-cylinder petrol engine, a variation of the previously known 2.0 E engine, was now available for the base model.

Altogether, although some layouts were not available everywhere outside Germany, Audi offered the following engine range for the 80/90 B4:

Petrol engines:
* 1.6 – , in-line four-cylinder (export only)
* 1.6 E – , in-line four-cylinder
* 2.0 – , in-line four-cylinder (base model in Germany)
* 2.0 E – , in-line four-cylinder
* 2.0 E 16v – , 16-valve, in-line four-cylinder
* 2.3 E 10v – , 10-valve, in-line five-cylinder
* 2.6 E – , V6
* 2.8 E – , V6
* S2 – , 2.2 L, 20-valve turbocharged in-line five-cylinder
* RS2 Avant – , 2.2 L, 20-valve turbocharged in-line five-cylinder

Diesel engines:
* 1.9 TD – , in-line four-cylinder turbodiesel
* 1.9 TDI – , in-line four-cylinder direct-injection turbodiesel (with intercooler)

Most petrol versions could be ordered with quattro permanent four-wheel-drive; at the time, however, it could only be combined with a five-speed manual transmission. Additionally, Audi built around 2,500 units of the &quot;Quattro Competition&quot; for the German and European market. It was a street homologation of the B4-based Super Tourenwagen Cup (STW) race car saloon with four-wheel drive and a modified , 16-valve, two-litre petrol engine. The powertrain had its roots in the two-litre, four-cylinder inline engines that most European Audi 80s were equipped with at the time. On the outside, the &quot;Quattro Competition&quot; featured the same bumpers as the S2, the V6 headlights, and a rear wing mounted on the bootlid.

Together with the saloon, Audi produced a B4-based estate, the &quot;Audi 80 Avant&quot;, and a convertible, the Audi Cabriolet, which was largely based on the B3 Coupé. This meant that Audi now had saloon, coupé, cabriolet, and estate variants of the 80 available to European customers. For the North American market, however, Audi only sold coupés during the 1990 and 1991 model years, and the station wagon was never officially available.
As of the 1994 model year, a limited edition model, known as &quot;Europa&quot;, was introduced on the European market. It could be ordered both as a saloon and an Avant. It was factory-equipped with power mirrors, alloy wheels, rear seat headrests, an airbag steering wheel, and offered a choice between power sunroof or air conditioning. It came in five different special colours. For &quot;regular&quot; 1994 B4 saloons and Avants, standard features as well as options available were stepped up too, including an airbag steering wheel and redesigned door liners (standard), and passenger airbags and a built-in engine immobiliser (optional).

The 80-series was effectively replaced by the new Audi A4 in 1994, a variant of the 1996 (B5) Volkswagen Passat. By that time it was feeling very dated in comparison with more modern rivals such as the BMW E36. Production ceased at a time when prestige European manufacturers were making the transition of older executive saloons to newer models based on newer platforms in the compact executive car market.

The B4 saloon was discontinued at the end of the 1994. The Avant was axed in 1995, and the Coupé (with no immediate replacement) followed suit in 1996. The Cabriolet, however, continued in production until August 2000. The B4 platform saloon was replaced by the Audi A4 for the 1995 model year (1996 in North America), followed by a new &quot;A4 Avant&quot; later in 1996. A mid-sized convertible was not available again until 2002, when the A4 Cabriolet was introduced. Since 2007, Audi has produced Audi A5 - which is similar in concept to the old 80-based Coupé.

=== Audi S2 ===

Audi developed a sports version of the Coupé in 1990, called the Audi Coupé S2. This replaced the famous Audi Quattro and was capable of 150 mph. In 1993, the S2 received some cosmetic updates, including new AVUS-style alloy wheels, ellipsoid beam (projector) headlamps, and clear front indicator lenses. This coincided with the introduction of the five-door S2 Avant, along with a limited run of four-door S2 sedan models, of which 306 were produced. The S2 saloon and Avant feature a lot of similarities in the rear axle support system to the later B5 A4 quattro. The B4 platform S2 Avant was also used between 1993 and 1995 as the basis for Audi&#x27;s RS2 Avant super-sports estate, which was modified for Audi with assistance from Porsche.

=== Audi RS2 Avant ===
The Audi RS2 Avant is fitted with a similar 2.2-litre turbocharged engine to the S2, but producing . It can accelerate from in 4.8 seconds and has a top speed of .

The Audi RS2 was generally only available as an Avant, although four 4-door saloon models were officially produced by the factory, including one for the chief of the RS2 development programme. The RS2 was at least partially assembled at the Porsche Rossle-Bau plant in Zuffenhausen. Prior to manufacturing the RS2, the Porsche Zuffenhausen assembly line was busy producing the high-performance W124 bodystyle Mercedes-Benz 500E. The RS2/Porsche link is further exemplified by the RS2&#x27;s dual circuit Porsche braking system (wearing Brembo calipers with a Porsche name), 7.0Jx17&quot; alloy wheels that were identical in design to the Porsche 911 Turbo wheels of that era, and side view mirrors are also borrowed from the Porsche 911 Turbo. Additionally, the word &quot;PORSCHE&quot; is inscribed in the RS2 factory emblems affixed to the tailgate and front grille, and on the engine&#x27;s inlet manifold. Porsche modified the Avant S2 body optics, added more power, better brakes, bigger anti-roll bars to front and rear, fine tuned the interior – and a super-sports estate was born. Porsche&#x27;s involvement in the project was on the strict understanding that a coupé model would not be produced, as this was felt to be too close to Porsche&#x27;s own products.

<text>The InterCity 125 (originally Inter-City 125) or High Speed Train (HST) is a diesel-powered high-speed passenger train built by British Rail Engineering Limited between 1975 and 1982. A total of 95 sets were produced, each comprising two Class 43 power cars, one at each end, and a rake of seven or eight Mark 3 coaches. The name is derived from its top operational speed of . At times, the sets have been classified as British Rail Classes 253, 254 and 255.

British Rail (BR) initially developed the HST as an interim measure in the early 1970s, as delays and cost concerns began to threaten their primary high-speed train project, the Advanced Passenger Train (APT). The HSTs are now widely considered to be among the most successful trains to have operated on the British railway network, both in terms of their initial impact and their longevity: their introduction into service between 1976 and 1982 resulted in significantly reduced journey times, and large increases in patronage on the routes on which they were operated. The trains proved to be a reliable workhorse, remaining in front-line service for decades. The first withdrawals began in 2017, 41years after they were introduced. , InterCity 125s remain in service with ScotRail, Great Western Railway, and Network Rail.

The design became the basis for an Australian variant, the Express Passenger Train (XPT), which entered service in New South Wales in 1982.

==Background==
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the British Transport Commission (BTC) was modernising its rail network. It wanted to increase intercity speeds so that railways could compete more effectively with motorways. The governments of the time were unwilling to fund dedicated high speed rail infrastructure, as happened in other countries, and so the BTC instead focused on developing new trains which could operate at higher speed using existing infrastructure. A team of engineers was assembled at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby in the early 1960s, to design and develop an Advanced Passenger Train (APT) capable of at least incorporating many features not previously seen on British railways—such as tilting to allow higher speeds on curves.

The APT project suffered repeated delays and in 1970, the British Railways Board (BRB) decided it would not be sufficiently developed to enter public service until well into the next decade, so a stopgap solution would be needed to reduce journey times in order to compete effectively with other modes of transport. At the instigation of Terry Miller, Chief Engineer (Traction &amp; Rolling Stock), the BRB authorised the development of a high-speed diesel train using tried and tested conventional technology for short-term use, until the APT was able to take over. An operational prototype was to be built by 1972.

==Development==
===Concept and design===
The high-speed diesel train, which became the HST or InterCity 125, was formed of a rake of Mark 3 passenger coaches between two streamlined power cars, one at each end. Each power car was fitted with a Paxman Valenta diesel engine which could produce . This engine was chosen due to its light weight, and subsequent high power-to-weight ratio. The decision to use two power cars was taken early in the project as design engineers calculated that the train would need to sustain 125mph on the routes for which it was designed (the Great Western Main Line, East Coast Main Line, Midland Main Line, and the Cross Country Route), and it was established that no &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; diesel engine was capable of producing such power. 

British Rail had used a similar idea of a train with integral power cars at each end a decade earlier, with their Blue Pullman sets; although these trains were not ultimately commercially successful, they established the validity of the idea, and are often seen as forerunners of the HSTs. The concept had several advantages; firstly, a power car at each end allowed the train to be driven from either end in push–pull formation with the power cars linked by electronic control systems, and therefore reverse direction without the need for a locomotive to be run around at terminus stations, secondly, the train could run with only one power car operational, though at reduced speed, therefore allowing a journey to continue in the event of a breakdown, and thirdly, it avoided the underfloor diesel engines found in diesel multiple units, therefore avoiding noise and vibration for passengers. Another factor was that two locomotives operating in push–pull formation, would cause less wear on the rails than a single locomotive. One of the design requirements for the HST was that it should exert no more force on the track at 125mph, than a Class 55 &#x27;Deltic&#x27; locomotive at 100mph, and each power car of the HST weighed a modest 70tons which allowed it to meet this requirement.

One of the key design requirements for the HSTs was that they should be able to run at 125mph on existing infrastructure. In order to achieve this, they had to be able to come to a stop from 125mph within existing signal spacings, which required a high performance braking system to be developed. This was achieved by a high performance disc brake system, in place of the clasp brakes used on traditional stock.

===Prototype===

To prove the concept, British Rail produced a prototype. The framework of the new locomotive, classified British Rail Class 41, was built at Crewe Works and transferred to Derby Litchurch Lane Works for completion. The design incorporated a driving desk around the centrally seated driver, a sound-proofed door between the cab and the engine room, and, unusually, no side windows. The prototype was the first diesel locomotive in British railway history to use AC alternators in place of a DC generator, with the output converted to DC when used for traction.

The prototype train of seven coaches and two locomotives was completed in August 1972 and in the autumn was running trials on the main line. The following year, high-speed testing was undertaken on the &quot;racing stretch&quot; of the East Coast Main Line between York and Darlington. The set was reduced to two power cars and five trailers, and there was a concerted attempt to see how fast the train would go. On 6 June 1973, was reached, which was bettered as the days passed. On 12 June, a world diesel speed record of was achieved, and the drivers believed that 150 mph was possible, but the BRB issued instructions for the high speed tests to cease. It was believed at the time that this was because the BRB wanted to promote the APT as the future of high speed rail travel in the UK.

The fixed-formation concept was proven in trial running between 1973 and 1976, and British Rail went on to build 95 sets of production HSTs to transform InterCity services.

===Production versions===

Manufacturing of the production power car sets began in 1974 at the Crewe Works, with the Mark 3 coaches being manufactured at the Derby Litchurch Lane Works. The first production power car, numbered 43002, was delivered in late 1975. The production versions were mechanically very similar to the prototype, but differed considerably in appearance: the streamlined wedge-shaped front end lacked conventional buffers, and the drawgear was hidden under a cowling. The single cab front window was much wider than the prototype&#x27;s, and side windows were included. Unlike the prototype, no driving position was included at the inner end, as the power cars were originally intended to operate in fixed formation.

The train&#x27;s appearance is the work of British industrial designer Kenneth Grange who was approached by British Rail to design the livery, but under his own impetus, and without telling anyone, decided to redesign the body. He worked with an aerodynamic engineer, and they built and tested a model in a wind tunnel. &quot;It really was rather quite brutal, rather clumsy. I thought, &#x27;Oh I&#x27;d like to get my hands on that&#x27;, although the brief was nothing to do with the shape, absolutely not at all.&quot; He presented the new design to British Rail and persuaded them to adopt it. After being withdrawn from GWR service, 43002 was acquired by the National Collection in November 2019 and was displayed at the National Railway Museum in York.

The redesigned front end also had the advantage of easing union acceptance of the train: the railway union ASLEF had objected to the prototype&#x27;s lack of space for a secondman to sit alongside the driver, and had refused to operate the prototype in public service. The cab on the production version was wide enough to accommodate two people, and so was able to overcome these objections. 

An InterCity 125 consists of two Class 43 diesel-electric power cars, each powered originally by 2,250 bhp (1,678 kW) Paxman Valenta engines (they have since been fitted with different engines), and a set of six to nine Mark 3 coaches.

Key features of the design are the high power-to-weight ratio of the locomotives (1678 kW per ~70-tonne loco), which were built for high-speed passenger travel, improved crashworthiness over previous models, and bi-directional running avoiding the need for the locomotive to run around at terminating stations. Until the HST&#x27;s introduction, the speed of British diesel-powered trains was limited to . The HST allowed a 25% increase in service speeds along many of the lines on which they operated.

Lighter axle loading allowed the trains to travel faster than conventional services along lines not suited to full-speed running, such as Edinburgh to Aberdeen. Coupled with superior acceleration over older locomotives, this allowed substantial cuts in journey times. The increased speed and rapid acceleration and deceleration of the HST made it ideal for passenger use.

==British Rail service==
===Introduction into service===
Deliveries continued in 1976, and on 4 October a partial service of HSTs running at began on the Western Region, from , on the Great Western and South Wales Main Lines. The radical update of the standard BR livery on the power cars was complemented by the &#x27;Inter-City 125&#x27; branding, which also appeared on timetables and promotional literature. By the start of the summer timetable in May 1977, the full complement of 27 Class 253 sets (253001–253027) was in service on the Western Region, replacing locomotive-hauled trains on the Bristol and South Wales routes. Passenger numbers rapidly increased due to the speed and frequency of the services. The displacement by HSTs of Class 50 locomotives to slower services effectively finished off the last Class 52 diesel-hydraulics by early 1977.

The production of Class 254 continued through 1977 for East Coast Main Line (ECML) services. The HSTs allocated to the ECML had eight coaches instead of seven on the Western Region, and British Rail had originally planned to fit uprated Valenta engines to the longer HSTs, but this was not carried out, as it was found that the engine&#x27;s coolant system would struggle to deal with the extra heat produced by a higher powered engine. The first 125mph East Coast HST services were introduced for the summer timetable in May 1978, with HSTs taking over &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; and other services. The previous generation of Class 55 &#x27;Deltic&#x27; locomotives were relegated to secondary duties, before being withdrawn entirely in late 1981. A full HST timetable for the ECML was due to be introduced in May 1979, but was delayed until late August due to the Penmanshiel Tunnel collapse. The HSTs reduced the London-Edinburgh journey time by up to an hour.

In 1979, HST services began in South West England, to destinations such as Exeter, and , and in 1981 they were introduced to the Cross Country Route via . In 1982 HSTs were introduced to Midland Main Line services from London St Pancras: Although the HSTs were mostly limited to a top speed of on those routes, their increased acceleration still reduced journey times. 

Ninety-five HST sets, including 197 Class 43 powercars, were built between 1976 and 1982. More Mark 3 trailer cars were built in the 1980s for the Western Region Class 253s, making them eight-car rakes in common with East Coast and Midland Main Line services. During the 1990s only the Cross-Country sets remained as seven-car rakes, with just one first-class coach.

One of the main selling points of the new HST services were the increase in speed and comfort without any increase in fares. The HST brought considerable improvements in service, and British Rail began active marketing to support the train&#x27;s introduction. The InterCity service was a great success for British Rail.
====Journey time reductions====
One of the main selling points of the HSTs were the reductions they could achieve in journey times, with the trains being marketed in publicity material as &#x27;The Journey Shrinker&#x27;. In 1973 British Rail produced a promotional booklet entitled &quot;Speed for the Seventies&quot; in which they laid out the expected journey times to be achieved with HSTs compared to the then extant timings.
Most of these predictions of the journey times achievable by HSTs proved to be quite accurate, and in some cases they were underestimates. For example, the best timing achieved for London to Bath was 62 minutes, and 115 minutes was achieved for London to York.
===Proposed electric version===
In the early 1980s, when electrification of the East Coast Main Line was in its early planning stages, serious consideration was given to producing an electric version of the HST, which would have been known as the HST-E. This would have kept the bodyshell and most of the mechanical components of the diesel version, but the power cars would have been electric locomotives fitted with pantographs. The thinking was, that as the diesel version had been proven, it would be a straightforward way to produce a 125mph trainset. The HST-E was proposed in response to the failure of the Advanced Passenger Train (APT) project. This proposal did not proceed, and BR instead developed a new electric trainset which would become the capable InterCity 225 to work the electrified services on the ECML, which came into service in the late-1980s.

===World records===

The prototype InterCity 125 (power cars 43000 and 43001) set the world speed record for diesel traction at on 12 June 1973.

A second world record for the fastest diesel-powered train, a speed of , was set by an HST on 1 November 1987, between Darlington and York with a test run for a new type of bogie for use on Mark 4 coaches on the same route. The record run was powered by 43102 (at the front) and 43159 (at the rear).

An HST also holds the world speed record for a diesel train carrying passengers. On 27 September 1985, a special press run for the launch of a new &quot;Tees-Tyne Pullman&quot; service from to , formed of a shortened 2+5 set, briefly touched north of . 

==Regions and operators==

===South West England and South Wales===
On the Western Region, InterCity 125 trains (designated class 253) were introduced on services from London to Bristol and South Wales, and extended to most daytime services from London to Devon and Cornwall. Some South Wales services were extended to , and in West Wales. Maintenance was provided at Old Oak Common and St Philip&#x27;s Marsh, and Laira also carried out maintenance after services to Devon and Cornwall were introduced in 1979.

British Rail Class 47 locomotives still operated cross-country services from Cornwall and South Wales to the North-East via the Cross Country Route, and London to the Midlands/Welsh Marches. Class 43s replaced them when the third batch of power cars was delivered in 2+7 formation with two first class coaches, a buffet car, and four second class coaches between two power cars. They were later expanded to a 2+8 formation, with an extra second class coach.

Great Western Trains was formed out of the privatisation of British Rail and operated the InterCity routes from London Paddington to the west of England. In 1998 FirstGroup acquired Great Western Trains and rebranded it First Great Western. InterCity 125s continued to work the same diagrams they had under British Rail, albeit in a different livery.

Great Western Railway used 43 HST sets to operate most intercity services from Paddington to Bristol, , , , Cardiff, , , , , Worcester, , , and , and some commuter services to , and . In 2012 all First Great Western&#x27;s intercity services were worked by InterCity 125 sets with the exception of sleeper services and some Cotswold Line services.

From 2005 the First Great Western HSTs were re-engined with MTU power units and the coaches were refurbished. Units for services in the M4 corridor/Thames Valley to Bristol, Hereford, Oxford, Exeter and Cardiff were converted to a high-density layout of mostly airline-style seats in standard class (only two tables per coach) to provide more seats for commuters. The remainder, for routes to Swansea and the West Country, included four tables per standard class coach.

The refurbished coaches had new seating (leather in first class), at-seat power points and a redesigned buffet bar. From 2010, one standard class coach in each set had a Volo TV system, but this was removed in 2014.

Another change was made in 2014, when some first class coaches were converted to standard class or composite (half standard and half first class), leaving first class coaches per set. The first class coaches were refurbished in a more luxurious style, and many tables with one seat each side in first class were replaced by individual airline-style seats.

By mid-2019, Great Western Railway no longer had any HSTs operating service to or from Paddington, having replaced all of them with Class 800 and Class 802.

Great Western Railway retained 24 powercars and 48 coaches to form 11 four-coach sets for use on local services between Cardiff and Penzance, replacing the British Rail Class 158. However, by the end of 2022 these sets were proving expensive to operate and increasingly difficult to maintain due to their age. With spare Class 802 sets post-Covid being able to fill in on the route, in December 2022 GWR announced plans to withdraw all of the HST Castle sets from use by December 2023. Whilst leased vehicles were returned to Angel Trains, four directly owned 2+4 Castle sets have been retained by GWR, with plans to retain them until at least December 2024.

===Eastern England and Scotland===

On the East Coast Main Line, the InterCity 125 designated Class 254 was the staple stock after the retirement of the Class 55 Deltic locomotives in 1980–1982, until the introduction of InterCity 225 following electrification in 1990. They were concentrated on services from London King&#x27;s Cross to Newcastle and Edinburgh Waverley, and to Glasgow Queen Street, Inverness and Aberdeen. In the months following the Penmanshiel Tunnel collapse in 1979, London to Scotland services ran via the Tyne Valley line from Newcastle to Carlisle then to Scotland via the West Coast Main Line. HSTs were also used on some services from London to Leeds, Bradford Forster Square, Cleethorpes, Hull and Scarborough.

The East Coast (ECML) formation was originally 2 + 8, increased to 2 + 9 in 2002 when extra stock became available. The ECML formation was two first-class coaches, one buffet (with 1st Class seating) and five (later six) standard-class coaches between the buffet and power cars. For a few years, formations included a TRUK (trailer restaurant kitchen) and buffet car, a TS (trailer second class) and TF (trailer first class) coaches, many formations were 4 × TS, TRUK, Buffet, 2 × TF. Nine trailer car units followed this formation, with the addition of a TS. &#x27;Pullman&#x27; services replace a TS with an additional first-class coach.
After privatisation, InterCity 125s were operated by Great North Eastern Railway (GNER), alongside electric InterCity 225 units from London to Newcastle and Edinburgh, and beyond the electrified sections (or where British Rail Class 91s cannot operate due to route availability restrictions) to Hull, Skipton, Harrogate, Inverness and Aberdeen.

In January 2007 the first of GNER&#x27;s 13 refurbished HSTs was unveiled with coaches rebuilt to the same &#x27;Mallard&#x27; standard as its InterCity 225 electric sets with similar seating, lighting, carpets and buffet cars. The power cars were upgraded with MTU engines. The first of the HST Mallards was in service by spring 2007.

In 2007 the franchise was taken over by National Express East Coast (NXEC), which continued the re-engining programme begun by GNER, and completed the refurbishment of the fleet in March 2009. Two power cars were transferred to First Great Western early in 2009. The final Mallard-upgraded Mark 3 coaches entered service with NXEC in October 2009.

Following an announcement by National Express that it would not provide further financial support to NXEC, the franchise ceased on 13 November 2009, and the operation of the route returned to public ownership. As a result, the 13 sets were operated by East Coast from late 2009. East Coast introduced an InterCity 125 service to Lincoln in 2011. The InterCity 125 was replaced by the electric InterCity 225 on the line to Skipton when the electrical infrastructure was upgraded. Eight East Coast services per day in each direction used the InterCity 125. In 2012, 43072 (now 43272), 43074 (now 43274) were transferred from East Midlands Trains and received MTU engines. In April 2015, Virgin Trains East Coast took over operation of the InterCity East Coast franchise. All trains passed with the InterCity East Coast franchise to London North Eastern Railway in June 2018.
In 2006, Grand Central obtained six Class 43 power cars to operate its London-Sunderland passenger service via the East Coast Main Line. The service was due to begin in December 2006 although upgrade work to enable the coaching stock (which was formerly used for locomotive-hauled services and had a different electric heating/power supply system) to operate with Class 43 power cars was heavily delayed and therefore pushed the starting date back to 18 December 2007. HSTs 43084 and 43123 were the final operational Paxman Valenta power cars, being re-engined in 2010 with the same MTU engines as other units. While at the works being re-engined, Grand Central added the orange stripe that appears on their Class 180 units, re-painted the front ends (this making them look more like the non-buffered HSTs), and re-numbered the power cars into the four-hundreds. Grand Central&#x27;s HSTs were cascaded to East Midlands Trains at the end of 2017.

In February 2019 Hull Trains commenced using a First Great Western set between London King&#x27;s Cross and Hull due to ongoing reliability issues with its Class 180s. A month later they introduced an additional set following further reliability issues. LNER withdrew its last InterCity 125s in December 2019.

===Midland Region===
On the London Midland Region, InterCity 125 trains were introduced later than on the other regions. They initially appeared on the former Midland Railway route from London St Pancras to Sheffield and Nottingham. Although they were initially not permitted to exceed on any part of the route, they still delivered time savings compared with the loco-hauled trains they replaced.

The Midland Main Line received a series of speed improvements over the next two decades, until it became possible for HSTs to run at up to on some sections. An upgrade to the full was proposed by British Rail in the early 1990s, but because of privatisation this did not happen. However line improvements were completed in time for the spring 2014 timetable change, which has permitted 125 mph running on some sections of the line and higher top speeds on others.

Most long-distance services on this route have been transferred to new Class 222 &quot;Meridian&quot; diesel-electric multiple units, although many London services from still used the InterCity 125, as did all services from London St Pancras to . Midland Mainline inherited HSTs from BR after privatisation and operated them on its primary services at up to 110 mph.

43089 also was returned to work on the mainline after being used in an experimental programme conducted by Network Rail and Hitachi. 43072, 43074 was transferred to East Coast in 2012. Since December 2013, InterCity 125 sets have been permitted to operate at speeds of up to 125 mph on certain parts of the routes from London St Pancras to Leeds and Nottingham.
On 15 May 2021, EMR retired their final two InterCity 125 trains, which were replaced by East Midlands Railway with , and had been displaced thanks to the introduction of and from Hull Trains and Greater Anglia. This made them the last HST operator to run InterCity 125 services to the capital.

===Cross-Country Route===

After privatisation, the Cross Country Route was operated by Virgin CrossCountry, who replaced their InterCity 125 trains in the period 2002–2004 with Bombardier Voyager high-speed DMUs. Most of the former Virgin CrossCountry fleet were stored for several years but a few ran on the Midland Main Line for the train company Midland Mainline.

In 2007, the franchise passed to Arriva CrossCountry. In response to overcrowding, the company reintroduced five HST sets to supplement its Voyagers.

In September 2008, CrossCountry refurbished its first HST set the coaches were refurbished to a similar &quot;Mallard&quot; standard as GNER trains, though their interior is in burgundy and there are fewer tables. They also differ from the East Coast sets in having electronic seat reservations, and the buffet car has been removed, with all catering provided at-seat from a catering base in coach B. Most of the coaches are rebuilt from loco-hauled Mark 3 stock. The refurbishment was carried out by Wabtec, Doncaster Works. Each set has had a TS removed, making them two power cars + seven coaches. All coaches retained were fitted with automatic doors, toilets with controlled emission tanks and other accessibility modifications at Doncaster Works.

CrossCountry operated its last InterCity 125 service in September 2023.

===West Coast and North Wales===
Virgin Trains West Coast HSTs regularly worked out of London Euston and Birmingham International to Holyhead and Blackpool North. They also worked some Euston to Manchester Piccadilly services. Virgin&#x27;s HSTs were re-deployed in May 2004. Due to there being numerous curves on the West Coast Main Line, the trains were not permitted to exceed 110 mph on any part of the route.

When the West Coast Main Line was upgraded by Network Rail in the 2000s, it became necessary to operate diversionary routes whilst work was going on. As a result, Midland Mainline was asked by the then Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to operate services from Manchester via the Hope Valley Line and Midland Main Line into while West Coast Main Line works took place. In a temporary operation dubbed &quot;Project Rio&quot;, a large percentage of the stored Virgin CrossCountry power cars were overhauled and returned to service in an enlarged Midland Mainline fleet. Ending on 10 September 2004, the &quot;Project Rio&quot; fleet was gradually disbanded, with power cars moving to First Great Western and GNER.

===ScotRail Inter7City===

Twenty-six HST sets, nine with four coaches and 17 with five coaches, moved from Great Western Railway to Abellio ScotRail after being refurbished by Wabtec at Doncaster Works with new interiors, controlled emission tanks and automatic sliding doors. They operate on services from Edinburgh and Glasgow to Aberdeen and Inverness, as well as between Aberdeen and Inverness. The first set entered service in October 2018. ScotRail&#x27;s HST fleet operates under the brand name &quot;Inter7City.&quot;

In September 2024, the Scottish Government announced their intention to replace ScotRail&#x27;s HST fleet.

===Network Rail===
One specially converted HST set is in service with Network Rail, assessing the condition of track so that engineers can determine where to work. The train is painted in the yellow livery used for maintenance vehicles, and often referred to as the &quot;flying banana&quot; (a nickname that was originally applied to the whole class because when first introduced by BR they wore a predominantly yellow livery). The set is the New Measurement Train.

Another single engine, 43089, was used in tests on hybrid battery powered vehicles in collaboration with Hitachi.

==Numbering and formation==

British Rail considered the InterCity 125 sets to be diesel multiple units because they were fixed formation trains. They were allocated British Rail Class 253 (2+7 sets allocated to Western Region depots for use on Western Region and Cross-Country services) and Class 254 (2+8 sets allocated to the Eastern and Scottish Regions for use on the East Coast Main Line), the prototype train having been Class 252. Therefore, each set was allocated a set number (253 xxx or 254 xxx), which was carried on the front of the power cars. Individual vehicles were numbered in the 4xxxx series (see table below) and, because they were regarded as multiple unit vehicles, also had regional prefixes according to their allocated depot (E for Eastern Region, SC for Scottish and W for Western); this included the power cars as well as the trailers.

With power cars often requiring maintenance more frequently than the trailer cars, power car swaps soon began to take place; there were a few spare power cars to allow for this. This often resulted in different set numbers being displayed at each end of the same train. As a result, during the early 1980s the power cars began to be regarded as &quot;loose&quot;, and the use of set numbers for the whole train was abandoned. The trailer cars remained in fixed formations, however, and still allocated a set number of sorts, although that was not displayed anywhere.

As sectorisation began to take hold during the mid-1980s, the use of regional prefixes on coaches and multiple unit vehicles was discontinued. At about the same time it was decided to reclassify the InterCity 125 trains (the hyphen having been dropped by the new InterCity sector) as locos and coaches. To avoid renumbering the power cars, they became British Rail Class 43 diesel locos, although a space was never inserted between the second and third digits (as was common practice on other locos at the time, e.g. 47 401).

The vehicle types used to form High Speed Trains are listed below:

The 197 production series power cars were numbered 43002–43198. 43001 was applied to the second of the two prototype power cars, while the first of the pair (now preserved as part of the National Collection) became 43000 – unusual because BR TOPS classification numbered its locomotives from 001 upwards (this was because it was not, at the time, classified as a locomotive). Subsequently, on fitting of new engines, power cars operated by the InterCity East Coast and Cross Country franchisees have been renumbered in the 432xx or 433xx series (by adding 200 to their serial numbers), while Grand Central also changed the third digit of its power cars to 4 (by adding 300 or 400).

The renumbering of the 400xx series catering vehicles in 1983 was to avoid their numbers clashing with the Class 40 diesel loco fleet (numbered 40 001 to 40 199) when BR&#x27;s loco (TOPS) and coaching stock number series were merged.

In 2002, Class 255 was allocated for the reformation of some HST power cars and trailers into semi-fixed formation trains, to be known as Virgin &quot;Challenger&quot; units, for use by Virgin CrossCountry. These formations would have had power cars sandwiching one Trailer First, a Trailer Buffet, two Trailer Seconds and a Trailer Guard Second. These plans came to naught as the Strategic Rail Authority planned to transfer most of the stock to Midland Mainline for its &#x27;Rio&#x27; services between London and Manchester.

=== Livery ===


The original &quot;Inter-City 125&quot; livery was blue and grey, with a yellow front to improve visibility which continued down the side of the power cars.

The second livery had mostly grey power-cars with a white band along the middle, yellow underneath the white band, with the InterCity colours (cream, red, white, brown) for the parcel compartment of the power cars and the coaches.

There was brownish-grey, dark grey (almost black) around the windows with a red and white stripe below the windows, and retaining the yellow bands on the power cars. The final variant of this livery saw the yellow side-bands replaced with white and did not feature the British Rail name or logo: it carried the new sector branding Intercity logo in serif type and an image of a flying swallow. This is commonly referred to as &quot;InterCity Swallow&quot; livery, and was applied to other locomotives in the sector.

After the privatisation of British Rail, train operating companies painted the HSTs in their own colour schemes, with some lasting longer than others.

Two of Great Western Railway&#x27;s powercars have been repainted into heritage liveries; 43002 has repainted into original InterCity 125 Blue &amp; Yellow livery whereas 43185 has been repainted into InterCity Swallow livery.

Two powercars [43046 and 43055] owned by Locomotive Services Limited have been repainted into Blue Pullman colours. The units will be used for railtour services operated by LSL beginning on 14 November 2020.

==Cultural impact==

===Public reaction===
The Intercity service proved an instant hit with the British public. By the early 1980s the HST had caught the travelling public&#x27;s imagination, thanks in part to a television advertising campaign fronted by entertainment personality Jimmy Savile, together with the advertising strap-line &quot;This is the age of the train&quot;. British Rail enjoyed a boom in patronage on the routes operated by the HSTs and InterCity&#x27;s revenues increased, although the total was not enough to remove the need for subsidies to British Rail.

===International interest===
The success of the HST had significant international impact. Foreign press for decades observed and praised the speed and quality of the service.

The InterCity 125 was used as a case study for evaluating the potential for a high-speed rail system in California. In Australia, it was used as the base for developing the XPT, in cooperation with British Rail.

===Models===

There have been many model and toy guises of the IC125. One of the first in the UK was by Hornby Railways, which launched its first model version in 1977. This model was supplied with an incorrect length BR Mk3 Open 2nd coach which was shortened to allow the model to reliably negotiate the smallest radius curves. This was done by removing one of the 8 side windows rather than scaling the whole length. In 1978 Hornby Railways issued an additional BR Mk 3 Open 2nd coach,
followed by their first model of a BR Mk 3 Open 1st Coach in 1979 and a BR Mk 3 Restaurant Buffet Car (TRUB) in 1980. The incorrect seven side windows was corrected to eight windows in 1985 when Hornby made modifications to the tooling for the BR Mk 3 (TS) and (TF) coaches. It was later released in InterCity &#x27;Swallow&#x27; livery, Great Western green-and-white, Midland Mainline and Virgin Trains. Lima released its version of the IC125 in 1982, of which the Mark 3 coaches were correct to the lengths of the real-life coaches and included the guard&#x27;s coach. Hornby eventually followed suit in the late-1990s, when its short Mark 3 coaches were replaced by correct scale length ones but omitted the guard&#x27;s coach. In 2006 Hornby released for the first time a modified tooling BR Mk 3 (TGS) Coach. In 2008 after acquiring tooling from ex-Lima rolling stock which then became the Hornby RailRoad range. Hornby released in a variety of different liveries both BR and post-privatisation a newly tooled super-detailed Class 43 powers car, alongside the more basic Class 43 HST power cars of the Railroad Range. In 2009 Hornby released newly tooled BR Mk 3 coaches. Graham Farish were the first to produce an HST in N gauge; more recently Dapol have produced another N gauge model of the train. Railway Shop (Hong Kong) produces a T gauge model (1:450 scale).

==Developments and changes==
===Damaged vehicles and accidents===

Five Class 43 locomotives have been written off in railway accidents, three of which occurred on the Great Western Main Line. 43011 was written off in the 1999 Ladbroke Grove rail crash, 43019 was written off after colliding with a car at Ufton Nervet in 2004 and 43173 was scrapped after heavy damage in the Southall rail crash of 1997. In each of these cases, the damage was to the leading power car; the trailing power cars suffered limited or no damage and were returned to service. At Ladbroke Grove and Ufton Nervet, the accidents were ultimately caused by factors not involving the HST sets or their drivers, although the set involved in the Ladbroke Grove crash had a faulty AWS system; however, the Southall accident was due to the HST colliding with a goods train which was entering Southall Goods Yard, crossing the main lines. The immediate cause of the crash was the result of the driver of the HST passing a red signal without stopping. In addition, the leading power car of the set had a faulty Automatic Warning System which if operational would have alerted the driver to his error and possibly prevented the accident. Following investigation, this system has since been required to be kept operational and switched on for all use of the InterCity 125 fleet.

An InterCity HST, comprising four coaches between Class 43 power cars 43030 and 43140, was involved in the Stonehaven derailment on 12 August 2020, in which three people died. Both power cars were scrapped following the subsequent investigation. 

===Re-engining and refurbishment===
In 2005, the train leasing company Angel Trains initiated and led an industry-wide programme to replace the 30-year-old Paxman Valenta engines in the HST power cars with new MTU 16V 4000 engines. The upgrade, which was part of a £110million total investment made by Angel Trains on its fleet of High Speed Trains, included the re-powering and refurbishment of 54 HST power cars; this included those then on lease to GNER (23), First Great Western (26) and CrossCountry (5). Virgin CrossCountry planned a similar project in the early 2000s but, with the collapse of the programme, the upgraded trainsets were sold along with their unmodified stablemates.

Additionally, many operators undertook some refurbishment of the Mark 3 coaches in the early 2000s. In view of the delay and change of direction of the HST2 programme, operators began to refurbish their HST fleets in 2006; both by remotoring with the more modern MTU4000 diesel engine, and by refurbishing the coach interiors. It was anticipated that these overhauls would give the HST at least another 10years in front-line service.

===Replacements===
The first partial replacement of HSTs occurred from 1988 on the East Coast Main Line, with the introduction of the InterCity 225 when the line to Edinburgh was electrified. Some were retained for services to Aberdeen, Inverness, Skipton, Bradford and Hull.

As the InterCity 125 fleet aged, it became increasingly recognised that the train was nearing the end of its service life. More recently, HSTs have been replaced (or augmented) by high-speed Diesel multiple units (DMUs), such as the Bombardier Voyagers and the UK express version of the Alstom Coradia. These DMUs have better acceleration than the HST, due to a higher power/weight ratio, with greater efficiency and braking performance.

In 2005, the initial concept of HST2 was rejected by the government and the rail industry as a like-for-like replacement for the HST fleet. In the light of this rejection, in 2006, existing operators turned to refurbishments of the InterCity 125 trains. Nevertheless, the HST2 concept was expanded and replaced by the InterCity Express Programme, with proposals for a joint replacement of both HST and InterCity 225 trains. The eventual successor to the two InterCity fleets is the Hitachi Super Express, comprising three classified types of fixed-rake formations: two electro-diesel types, the Class 800 sets and the Class 802 sets, and the electric multiple unit Class 801 sets.

On the Greater Western franchise, the first HST was returned to its leasing company in September 2017; by June 2019, all sets on inter-city routes were withdrawn in favour of the Class 800 and the Class 802 sets.

===Sewage discharge===
In the UK, train operators are allowed legally to discharge up to 25 litres of untreated waste at a time on to the track. Most Mk3 coaches have no toilet tanks, discharging directly onto the track. In the 2000s, both the RMT trade union and politicians were concerned at the environmental impact of this legacy issue. The problem was first raised in 2003, after Railtrack staff at abandoned local clean-up and then track maintenance procedures due to an excessive buildup of sewage waste in the area. In 2006 the RMT agreed waste-tank and clean-out developments at Northern Rail&#x27;s Heaton depot in 2006 with GNER, plus new clean-out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over the previous 18 months.

By 2011, the European Union had started a formal investigation to see whether trains composed of such coaches were breaking EU environmental and health laws, although the Environment Agency confirmed that train companies claimed special exemptions to dump waste along the tracks. In 2013, transport minister Susan Kramer branded the practice &quot;utterly disgusting&quot; and called on the industry to take action. ATOC responded by stating that, as all new vehicles had to be fitted with compliant toilet tanks, with withdrawal of the HSTs by the end of 2017 the problem would be solved. HSTs remained in operation after 2017, but sliding-door conversions of CrossCountry&#x27;s fleet and the shortened sets for GWR and ScotRail have all included the fitting of controlled emission toilets.

===Obsolescence factors===
In 2019, HSTs were not permitted to operate passenger services on the National Rail network in their original form because various deficiencies made them non-compliant with accessibility regulations – in particular, the need to open doors manually. However, to avoid rolling stock shortages, some operators were granted temporary permission to operate them, namely ScotRail, whose sets were planned to be modified, and East Midlands Trains, who have since withdrawn their sets in favour of Class 222 &quot;Meridians&quot;.

==Australian variant==


The InterCity 125 was the design basis of the New South Wales XPT, in cooperation with British Rail. 19 power cars and 60 carriages went into service starting in 1982. The XPT is higher and wider than the InterCity 125. The passenger cars were based on a Budd design, the power cars were shorter, and the engine was downrated and the gearing lowered for a top operating speed of . The suspension was modified to operate on less stable track, and the cooling system and air filters adapted for the hotter, dustier Australian conditions. Just as they had in Britain, the trains revolutionised passenger rail schedules and standards.

<doc id="620046" wikidata="Q2450317" url="?curid=620046" title="Sakura Kasugano">
<text>is a fictional character in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. She made her first appearance in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; in 1996 and is a young Japanese fighter who idolizes the series&#x27; protagonist Ryu, by whom she wants to be trained. She has often appeared in other games, including many crossover titles. Sakura has quickly become a firm fan favorite in both Japan and the West.

==Conception and design==
During the development of the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series, character designer Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda expressed his disdain for how he felt the series was proceeding, recycling too many elements from preceding games while also appearing to be more influenced by the works of other companies. With the second game in the series, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, he decided to take a more involved approach. Not wanting to do so half-heartedly, he wanted to include a design he felt could differentiate it from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series by including a more distinct &quot;high school girl&quot; type of character. However, after he handed the design over to the development team the character was cut from the final game shortly thereafter. Disappointed he returned to his desk, but one of his superiors passing by noticed the design and praised it, insisting that it be put back into the game.

Sakura stands 157 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall, and has measurements of 80-60-84 cm (32-24-33 in). Her outfit consists of a Japanese school uniform known as a sailor &quot;fuku&quot;, consisting of a white and blue loos shirt that exposes her lower midriff, a yellow scarf around the neck, a red undershirt, and a blue skirt with red bloomers underneath. Her hands are covered with red fighting gloves, while she has red sneakers on her feet. Meanwhile a long white headband covers her brow visible through her short haircut. Yasuda chose the outfit due to its association with Japanese high school girls, but also due to its presence as a trope in various Japanese media creating instant recognizability with audiences. Yasuda stated regarding the choice &quot;As characters, female high school students are all-powerful in Japan [...] They&#x27;re pretty much at the top of hierarchy&quot;.

Yasuda stated regarding the design that he was annoyed at the attitudes of the development team at the time who were younger and more focused on current style trends. Additionally he felt they wanted to focus solely on &quot;cool&quot; characters and exclude more &quot;weird&quot; designs seen in the preceding games, such as E. Honda, and over-emphasizing an anime aesthetic in his view. He submitted Sakura knowing they expected a character more in line with designs seen in media such as &quot;The Matrix&quot;, expecting the project leaders would dislike the submission. He additionally wanted her to be &quot;something different&quot; in the roster that fit outside the game&#x27;s &quot;narrow world view&quot;. Additional artwork for Sakura was provided by artist Naoto &quot;Bengus&quot; Kuroshima, who considers her a character he could express himself more easily with in contrast to others in the series and one he could draw naturally. Yasuda in turn appreciated his additions, feeling they helped her become a great character. The outfit remained standard look in titles up to &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, as the producers felt it was an appearance for her players expected, even though by that point in the series&#x27; timeline she was no longer a high school student.

With her appearance in &quot;IV&quot; she was given several alternative outfits such as gym clothes and a facsimile of fellow character Ryu&#x27;s attire. Designed by Daigo Ikeno, he found himself drawing a large number of sketches of her due to her cute design, while maintaining what he called her &quot;peek-a-boo&quot; aspect.

An early design for &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; featured her in a kimono shirt and hakama pants, but was later abandoned in favor of sailor fuku with red underwear, often seen during her kicks. One pose used by Sakura after winning a battle is to moonwalk. In the ending of &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, her hair is longer and she now sports a tracksuit top and a pair of athletic shorts. For her appearance in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, Sakura&#x27;s development ideas resembling her previous games, however in the end she was given a complete redesign to signify her no longer being a high school student despite how &quot;schoolgirl outfit may be the strongest image associated with Sakura&quot; (it is still available as an alternate costume). Other ideas included Sakura working a part-time job at a Japanese bento shop or as an assistant and actor for a motion capture studio. Her new default outfit is based on those worn by Japanese idols and she is wearing a red headband out of respect for Ryu.

==Appearances==
===Video games===
====&quot;Street Fighter&quot;====
Sakura first appears in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;, where she participates in street fighting after watching Ryu win the first World Warrior tournament. She searches for him and wishes for him to train her to be a better fighter. She eventually comes across Ryu, who tells her he cannot train her as he still has much to learn himself shortly after a sparring match.

In &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, Sakura decides to travel the world to find Ryu. After Ryu saves her from M. Bison, he promises Sakura a rematch (at around the same time, she met and formed a rivalry with Karin Kanzuki).

Sakura is playable in the &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; series&#x27; fighting games &quot;Street Fighter EX Plus α&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter EX3&quot;. She would also appear as the only non-&quot;Street Fighter II&quot; character in the proposed but never realized game &quot;Street Fighter IV: Flashback&quot;. She is featured in the spin-off games &quot;Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Battle Combination&quot;.

In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, years have passed since Sakura last saw Ryu, so she decides to find Ryu again for a match in the new worldwide tournament. In the introduction sequences of &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;, she is often seen in a group of three with Dan Hibiki and Blanka. She eventually finds Ryu. After the tournament, they exchange goodbyes. In her ending, a slightly older-looking Sakura sees Ryu approaching.

In &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, she is done with school and now works part-time at an arcade, but wonders what decisions she needs to make in order to be satisfied with her future. Her rivalry with Karin continues and when Karin notices Sakura&#x27;s problem, she sends Ryu over to Sakura&#x27;s house to spar with her friend.

Sakura is controlled in the same way as Ryu and Ken, but her special moves flow differently and are less powerful. Sakura&#x27;s moveset contains many variants of their moves, including the Shouoken (a Shoryuken unleashed from a running start), the Shunpukyaku (a jumping Tatsumaki Senpukyaku), and a less-powerful Hadouken that she can charge, though at the cost of distance. In the Capcom-developed &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; games, the Hadouken is replaced by the Hadoushou, a point-blank-range blast of energy. Her moves and combos have high potential to stun opponents and also provide many an opportunity for mix-ups. However, her somewhat low stamina and her lack of other available approaches (particularly her weak projectile) require a certain amount of finesse, leaving little room for error; this ultimately makes Sakura a high-risk, high-reward character. Sakura&#x27;s combo-heavy playstyle, when supplemented by her normal and special attacks, makes her a devastating fighter once she gets an opening. Dark Sakura performs the Hadouken horizontally instead of diagonally and uses the techniques of Akuma.

====Other games====
Sakura makes a guest appearance in the fighting game &quot;Rival Schools: United by Fate&quot;, where she is involved in the adventure between her Tamagawa Minami High School and various other schools in Aoharu City. After helping her childhood friend Hinata and the others out from within the ordeal, she realizes how much it means to her to protect something she cares about.

Sakura has appeared in various crossover fighting games, including the &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot; and &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series, as well as in &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix&quot; and &quot;Capcom Fighting Evolution&quot;. She has an alter-ego called &quot;Dark Sakura&quot; as a secret character in &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;. She also appears as DLC in &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; with Blanka as her official tag team partner.

Sakura is a playable unit in the tactical role-playing game &quot;Namco × Capcom&quot;. She is featured in the social game &quot;Onimusha Soul&quot;, where she appears in three different forms redesigned to fit its feudal Japan theme. In the mobile puzzle game &quot;Street Fighter: Puzzle Spirits&quot;, she appears as a super-deformed character. Her likeness appears in &quot;We Love Golf!&quot; as an unlockable cosplay outfit for the character Meg and her character costume can be unlocked in &quot;Crimson Tears&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Sakura is the titular character of the manga series &quot;Street Fighter: Sakura Ganbaru!&quot; by Masahiko Nakahira, where she becomes a fighter in order to fight Ryu. She starred in the comic book miniseries &quot;Street Fighter Legends: Sakura&quot; (and the one-shot &quot;Street Fighter: Sakura vs. Karin&quot;) by UDON, and appeared in UDON&#x27;s other &quot;Street Fighter&quot; comic books and the &quot;Rival Schools&quot; comic. She also appears in the &quot;Super Street Fighter&quot; graphic novels (sequel to the previous UDON comics), in which she became Ryu&#x27;s full-time apprentice and succumbed the power of the Dark Hadou before Ryu absorbed it out of her.

Sakura is a character in the anime films &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: Generations&quot;, and appears in the episode &quot;Second to None&quot; of the American cartoon series &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. She is a supporting character in &quot;Street Fighter IV: The Ties That Bind&quot;, assisting Ken in his efforts to locate Ryu.

Victor Entertainment released a drama CD &quot;Street Fighter Zero 2 Another Story&quot; in 1996, which had Sakura as the lead character. A sequel followed later that same year. Sakura&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Kono Omoi o Tsutaetai&quot; sung by Yuko Sasamoto, her voice actress in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; and other games following, was released commercially.

Many figures of Sakura were released by various manufacturers, such as one in two versions by Kotobukiya in 2015. &quot;Sakura&#x27;s bowl of stamina&quot; meals were included in a restaurant menu during one promotional event. Sakura&#x27;s card is included in the card games &quot;Street Fighter Deck-Building Game&quot; and &quot;Universal Fighting System&quot;.

A Sakura cosmetic outfit has also been added to &quot;Fortnite&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Sakura has been well received since her introduction. The staff of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; described her as one of Capcom&#x27;s best characters, stating while the word &quot;fanboy/fangirl&quot; was often a negative, her idol worship of Ryu allowed her to develop into one of the best fighters in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; setting. Noting Sakura&#x27;s role as one of the few female characters introduced in the franchise at the point, of her introduction they felt her &quot;spunky, can-do attitude&quot; made her one of the most popular characters in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; series. The staff of &quot;New Zealand Station&quot; magazine on the other hand were critical of her character, feeling she represented &quot;dangerous new territory&quot; for the depiction of women in gaming as they felt Capcom had shifted away from the &quot;wholesome and strong-willed Chun Li into the cute but undeniably underaged Sakura&quot;.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s D. F. Smith described Sakura as being at the start of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; becoming a multimedia phenomon through various media and merchandise, stating that she was &quot;never just a video game character&quot; due to her presence in the &quot;Sakura Ganbaru!&quot; comic strip. In terms of design, he argued that many depending on how one looked at her the emphasis on sex appeal may be too obvious and described her as a &quot;teenage girl in a sailor uniform with a skirt that&#x27;s a whole lot shorter than normal&quot; and added &quot;No prizes for guessing who that&#x27;s meant to appeal to.&quot; Regardless, he felt this contrasted well with her demeanor, and that while she was often the subject of comic relief and her appearance might be &quot;a little silly [...] her attitude is all business&quot;. Michael Colwander of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; stated that &quot;Few characters have made as much of an impact on the SF series as Sakura when she debuted&quot; due to how well her energetic personality resonated with the fan community. He further noted that while her schoolgirl uniform had defined her character for some time he appreciated how well her &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; attire represented a progression in time for the character, and served as a good start to illustrate the franchise moving forward narratively.

In terms of her character, Suriel Vazquez and Eric Van Allen of &quot;Paste&quot; stated they felt Sakura was sometimes &quot;the only character who’s actually having fun with this whole street-fighting thing&quot; in the franchise, praising her infectious &quot;relentless optimism&quot; and her relationships with the other characters in the franchise. They added while she wasn&#x27;t the strongest character in the series, they still appreciated that she was self-taught and eager, and saw her as a reflection of how players should approach fighting games: &quot;acknowledging weaknesses while taking them in stride&quot;. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; meanwhile called her &quot;one of the best characters in the series&quot;, stating that in many ways she added meaning to Ryu&#x27;s life as a character and acted as the &quot;angel&quot; on his shoulder in contrast to his rivalry with Akuma and constantly believing him. He further called her a &quot;plucky go-getter&quot;, appreciating how she managed to carve her own niche in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; universe and illustrated visible growth as a character through her relationships with Dan, Karin and the &quot;Rival Schools&quot; cast.

<text>The Audi A3 is a small family car (C-segment) manufactured and marketed by the German automaker Audi AG since September 1996, currently in its fourth generation.

The first two generations of the Audi A3 were based on the Volkswagen Group A platform, while the third and fourth generations use the Volkswagen Group MQB platform.

==First generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 8L; 1996)==
Audi announced the first generation A3 (&quot;Typ&quot; 8L) in June 1995. The model was launched for the European market in September 1996 and marked Audi&#x27;s return to small cars after 19 years, following the demise of the Audi 50 in 1978. 

The A3 was the first Volkswagen Group model to use the PQ34 (or &quot;A4&quot;) platform, bearing close resemblance to the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, which arrived a year later. Within three years of the A3&#x27;s launch, the PQ34 platform was utilised by seven different vehicles.

Initially, the A3 was only available as a three-door hatchback; this was done to give the model a sportier image and differentiate it from the Golf. Offered with transversely mounted inline four-cylinder engines in both front and quattro four-wheel drive, the A3 was Audi&#x27;s eighth model to have five valves per cylinder. The dashboard was also used by the first generation SEAT León and second generation SEAT Toledo.

The United Kingdom received the Audi A3 in November 1996. 

In 1999, Audi expanded the A3 range with the introduction of a five-door hatch and two new engine options; a 1.8 L turbocharged inline four-cylinder rated at , and a 1.9 L TDI diesel with unit injector &quot;Pumpe Düse&quot; (PD) technology and a variable geometry turbocharger. The four-wheel drive A3 1.8T Quattro used either the or engine, and the same Haldex Traction-based quattro system as the Audi S3 and Audi TT.

In late 2000, the A3 range was updated with new headlights and taillights, an improved interior, and other minor cosmetic changes alongside the introduction of a six-speed manual gearbox on the 1.8T and new 1.9 TDI.

With this update, Audi&#x27;s electronic stability control, traction-control, and brake force distribution systems became standard in some countries.

Although the first generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, it continued to be sold in select markets; Brazilian production of &quot;Typ&quot; 8L A3 continued until 2006.

===Safety===

The first generation A3 received a Euro NCAP rating of 4 out of 5 stars. Their evaluation concluded &quot;the column lock, adjuster lever and bracket presented hazards in the knee impact area for the driver. These could cause high loads on his upper legs and damage to his knees.&quot; The A3 also provided minimal protection for pedestrians, and received two stars out of a possible four.

===S3 (1999–2003)===

Audi released the A3-derived S3 in 1999. Only available as a three-door hatchback, the S3 was powered by a turbocharged 1.8 L 20v inline four-cylinder. Early models (1999–2001) produced , with later models (2001–2003) receiving variable valve timing which increased output to . The engine had a maximum torque output of . The S3 was the first Audi S-series car to utilise a smaller four-cylinder engine.

The S3&#x27;s quattro system utilises a Haldex Traction coupling to adjust the bias of torque distribution from the front to rear axle as grip requirements change. Due to this, the S3 typically operates in front-wheel-drive in most conditions

The S3 was sold in Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

In 2002, the S3 received a facelift, receiving revised front wings, rear lights clusters, single-piece headlight and indicator units, and minor interior trim updates.

Standard features include xenon HID headlamps with high pressure washers and auto levelers, front fog lamps, 17&quot; &quot;Avus&quot; alloy wheels with 225/45R17 tyres, electrically adjustable Recaro leather seats, climate control, an alarm and electronic stability control with traction control.

Options include a Bose sound system, boot/trunk or in-dash mounted 6-disc CD changer, metallic paint, 18-inch 9-spoke RSTT wheels, glass sunroof, centre arm rest, privacy glass (B-pillar backwards), auto-dimming rear-view mirror, parking assist, luggage net, heated front seats, cruise control, aluminium door mirror casings and part leather/Alcantara (blue/silver/yellow) combination seat coverings. Some of these items are standard in certain export markets.

===Engines===
The engines used in the &quot;Typ&quot; 8L range are also used in a range of other Volkswagen Group vehicles.
==Second generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 8P; 2003)==
===Initial release===
At the 2003 Geneva Motor Show, Audi launched the second generation of the A3, the &quot;Typ&quot; 8P, designed by Gary Telaak during 2000 (however, the final design was frozen in 2001). Originally launched only as a three-door hatchback with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new automobile platform (the PQ35 platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new petrol engines with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6 petrol and 1.9 diesel).

In mid-2003 the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated , and a 3.2 L VR6 engine (for the first time) with . Haldex Traction-based quattro on-demand four-wheel drive, and the S-Tronic semi-auto gearbox were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over .

In 2005 the &quot;S line&quot; trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front-end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 inline-four FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 Quattro following.
====A3 Sportback (2004–2013)====
The five-door &quot;Sportback&quot; model was introduced in June 2004. The A3 Sportback is longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370 litres). It also received the new &quot;single frame&quot; front grille originally introduced in the A8 W12, which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.

====S3 (2006–2013)====

In August 2006, Audi introduced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation—&quot;Typ&quot; 8P—S3 is powered by a modified and uprated Volkswagen Group-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged FSI petrol engine, with a maximum output of . As with all Audi S models, the design was done in-house by quattro GmbH. The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size (KKK K04) and larger intercooler. The most powerful form of this engine, and quattro four-wheel drive, makes for a time of 5.7 seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of . Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed S-Tronic automatic transmissions with the S3.

The spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a &quot;Quattro&quot; model, the S3 does not employ a Torsen centre differential (as in other common Quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish Haldex Traction system in its on-demand four-wheel drive transmission, due to the transverse engine layout.

====Safety====

Euro NCAP tested a second-generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, seatbelt pretensioners, and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. &quot;A poor result for a new car&quot; was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.

===2008 facelift===
Audi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008. These include revised nose and tail styling, with a modified grille and daytime running lights, common rail 2.0 TDI engines, seven-speed S tronic dual clutch transmission availability for the smaller non-U.S. engines, and optional &quot;magnetic ride&quot; adaptive shock absorbers. In addition, the range now includes an S3 Sportback model.

Also, a cabriolet version was introduced. It was similar in dimensions to the 3-door version, with a two-box design.

====Audi A3 TDI Clubsport quattro (2008)====
Audi A3 TDI Clubsport quattro is a concept car unveiled in 2008. Based on the Audi A3 three-door, it is an approach by Audi to address both performance and the environment.

The engine in the concept car is a turbocharged 2.0-litre diesel producing and of torque. It produces per litre while meeting Euro 5 Diesel emission standards. It uses the quattro drive system with a six-speed manual transmission.

The chassis has Audi&#x27;s Magnetic Ride Suspension system, lowering the vehicle from the base model. It also has ceramic front brakes, a four-link rear suspension and electro-mechanical servo assist for the rack and pinion steering.

The RS 3 Sportback is equipped with 7-speed dual clutch S tronic transmission and quattro all-wheel drive system. Scott Keogh of Audi of America said in April 2015 that he&#x27;s &quot;confident&quot; we&#x27;ll see the car come to the United States.

In 2017, the RS3 sedan or saloon was added to the line-up. In the same year, the RS3 was introduced to the North American market. The RS3 can be ordered with a fixed-suspension or an adjustable magnetic damper. Depending on the country, the RS3 can be purchased with different optional packages. For example, the Black Optic package includes high-gloss black 19-inch wheels, high-gloss black outside mirror covers, and a high-gloss black trunk lip spoiler, while the Dynamic package consists of titanium 19-inch wheels with summer performance tires, red brake calipers, and a sport exhaust system.

===2016 facelift===


After four years, the third-generation Audi A3 was given a facelift for the model year 2016, which also coincided with the 20th anniversary of the A3 name. The facelifted model was first unveiled through a set of official images in April 2016. The new A3 Saloon was given significant cosmetic updates, which were inline with the automaker&#x27;s new design philosophy. As a result, the 2017 Audi A3 featured the Matrix LED headlamps that were earlier seen in the A8 flagship saloon and the R8 supercar. The front grille was also given a refreshed treatment that made the A3 look like the A4. Changes on the sides and rear were minimal, with only the taillights getting optional LEDs. There were multiple updates on the interior as well, with a fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster screen placed behind a revised steering wheel available as an optional upgrade. Sold in Europe and released in the United States for the 2016 model year.

==Fourth generation (&quot;Typ&quot; 8Y; 2020)==


The new A3 was unveiled online in 2020.

The new interior and exterior styling is heavily inspired by Lamborghini, LED headlights and taillights, with the option of Matrix and Laser LED headlights. It shares the MQB evo platform with other Audi models, and with the Volkswagen Golf Mk8, SEAT Leon Mk4, and Škoda Octavia Mk4.

It is 3 centimetres longer and wider when compared to the outgoing model while keeping the wheelbase length the same, trunk cargo space is 380 litres with the seats up, and 1200 litres with the seats folded down. It has a drag coefficient of 0.28, and is powered by 1.0-litre 3-cylinder petrol turbocharged engine with 110 hp, 1.5-litre with 150 hp, 2.0-litre TDI with 116 hp or 150 hp.

There is also a new 2.0-litre Quattro version in both petrol and diesel variants. It produces and of torque (400 Nm for the diesel variant). It also has reduced cargo space (320 litres instead of the 380 litres in the other A3 variants) due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system.

The S3 model has the same 2.0L petrol engine from the previous generation, producing and of torque, but this time is only available with an automatic gearbox. Similarly it has reduced cargo space due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system. In the United States, the S3 is equipped with the newer EA888.4 2.0L engine shared with the Mk8 Golf R, rated at and .

Like the previous generation, the new S3 also comes as a saloon/sedan.

This generation of the A3 Saloon is not expected to arrive in North America until late 2021, as a 2022 model. North America will not get the &quot;Sportback e-Tron&quot; like before. In the countries that will receive The PHEV A3 will no longer be called The e-tron because this name is reserved for electric Audi cars. Instead, it is called The TFSIe. There are 2 version of the TFSIe, called the &quot;40&quot; and the &quot;45&quot;. The former dispatches a 0- time of 7.8 sec, while the latter is based on the Golf GTE and is a second quicker to .

This generation of the A3 Sportback is arriving in Thailand this November 2021, as a 2022 model.

=== Audi RS 3 ===
The highest specification RS 3 model is fitted with a 2.5-litre 5-cylinder producing and , and has 0- acceleration time of 3.8 seconds. It gets a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic, or an electric S-Tronic gearbox. It also gets the new MMI infotainment system, with a 10.25 or 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a secondary screen of 10.1-inches. With the RS Dynamic package the speed limiter is removed, allowing the RS3 to reach a top speed of . The US-market RS3 produces marginally more power than the European RS3, at a claimed . This is partially due to the lack of a petrol particulate filter for US model cars, as it is not required to meet emissions standards. The US-market RS3 instead receives a secondary catalytic converter.

In October 2022, the RS3 Performance Edition was introduced for European buyers. The boost was increased from , bringing power up to and thus matching the peak power of the federalized version. Torque remained as before but across a slightly wider range. The (unlimited) top speed reaches , a first for an A3 based model. Production is limited to 300 examples.
===Facelift===
Audi presented a revised version of the A3 on 12 March 2024. From now on, the hatchback will also be available as an &quot;allstreet&quot; variant, featuring a raised body and off-road trim.

<doc id="620076" wikidata="Q1991483" url="?curid=620076" title="Bardsey Island">
<text>Bardsey Island (), known as the legendary &quot;Island of 20,000 Saints&quot;, is located off the Llŷn Peninsula in the Welsh county of Gwynedd. The Welsh name means &quot;The Island in the Currents&quot;, while its English name refers to the &quot;Island of the Bards&quot;, or possibly the Viking chieftain, &quot;Barda&quot;. At in area it is the fourth largest offshore island in Wales, with a population of 11.

The north east rises steeply from the sea to a height of at Mynydd Enlli, which is a Marilyn, while the western plain is low and relatively flat cultivated farmland. To the south the island narrows to an isthmus, connecting a peninsula on which the lighthouse stands. Since 1974 it has been included in the community of Aberdaron.

The island has been an important religious site since the 6th century, when it is said that the Welsh king Einion Frenin and Saint Cadfan founded a monastery there. In medieval times it was a major centre of pilgrimage and, by 1212, belonged to the Augustinian Canons Regular. The monastery was dissolved and its buildings demolished by Henry VIII in 1537, but the island remains an attraction for pilgrims, marking the end point of the North Wales Pilgrims Way.

Bardsey Island is famous for its wildlife and rugged scenery. A bird observatory was established in 1953. It is a nesting place for Manx shearwaters and choughs, with rare plants, and habitats undisturbed by modern farming practices. The waters around the island attract dolphins and porpoises and grey seals.

In 2023, the island became the first site in Europe to be awarded International Dark Sky Sanctuary certification.

==Geology==
Like the western and northern parts of nearby Llŷn, the island is formed from rocks of the late Precambrian Gwna Group, itself a part of the Monian Supergroup. The rocks are a mélange, often referred to as the Gwna Mélange, which contain an extraordinary mix of clasts of all sizes up to across and of very varied types, including both sedimentary and igneous origin. Blocks of sheared granite within this mélange are visible in the northwestern coastal cliffs of the island. Elsewhere clasts of quartzite, limestone, sandstone, mudstone, jasper and basalt can be found. The deposit is interpreted as an olistostrome, a giant underwater landslide possibly triggered by an earthquake some time after 614 million years ago.

A dolerite dyke of Ordovician age intrudes the melange at Trwyn y Gorlech in the north whilst an olivine dolerite dyke of Tertiary age is seen at Cafn Enlli in the southeast. Further dykes occur in the cliffs at Ogof y Gaseg and at Ogof Hir.

A thin spread of glacial till stretches across the centre of the island, a relict of the late Devensian Irish Sea Icesheet. There is a small patch of blown sand at Porth Solfach on the west coast and a landslip at Briw Cerrig at the foot of the cliffs on the east coast.

==History==
The island was inhabited in Neolithic times, and traces of hut circles remain. During the 5th century, the island became a refuge for persecuted Christians, and a small monastery existed. Around 516, Saint Einion, king of Llyn, invited the Breton Saint Cadfan to move to the island from his first residence in Tywyn. Under Cadfan&#x27;s guidance, St Mary&#x27;s Abbey was built. For centuries, the island was important as &quot;the holy place of burial for all the bravest and best in the land&quot;.

Bards called it &quot;a direct path to heaven&quot; and &quot;the gates of Paradise&quot;, and in medieval times three pilgrimages to Bardsey were considered to be of equivalent benefit to the soul as one to Rome.

In 1188, the abbey was still a local institution but, by 1212, it belonged to the Canons Regular. Many people still walk the journey to Aberdaron and Uwchmynydd each year in the footsteps of the saints, although today only ruins of the old abbey&#x27;s 13th century bell tower remain. A Celtic cross amidst the ruins commemorates the 20,000 saints reputed to be buried on the island.

Saint Einion is sometimes claimed to have joined the community on the island, although his relics are claimed by Llanengan on the mainland. Saint Deiniol, the Bishop of Bangor, was buried on the island in 584. Saint Dyfrig was also buried on Bardsey Island, although in 1120 his remains were transferred to Llandaff centuries later.
The Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535, on the orders of Henry VIII, resulted in St Mary&#x27;s Abbey being dissolved and its buildings demolished in 1537. The choir stalls, two screens and the bells were transferred to Llanengan, where the parish church was then being built.

In the 16th century, Bardsey was owned by Sir John Wynn (an ancestor of the Newborough barons), who was standard bearer to Edward VI at Kett&#x27;s Rebellion in Norfolk in 1549.

For many years Bardsey Island formed part of the Newborough Estate, and between 1870 and 1875 the island&#x27;s farms were rebuilt; a small limestone quarry was opened, and a lime kiln constructed. Carreg and Plas Bach are separate buildings, but the remaining eight were built as semi-detached houses, each pair with outbuildings set around a shared yard. The buildings are Grade II listed and, in 2008, Cadw approved a grant of £15,000 to cover the first phase of repairs. Only one of the original &quot;croglofft&quot; cottages, Carreg Bach, survives. Given the choice of a harbour or a new church, in 1875 the islanders asked the estate to provide a place of worship; a Methodist chapel was built.

The island had a population of 90 by 1841. It had increased to 132 in 1881; by 1961 it had fallen to seventeen. The island&#x27;s small school, opened in a former chapel in 1919 and closed in 1953. In 2019 there was a long-term population of eleven, of whom four lived on the island during the winter.

The Bardsey Island Trust () bought the island in 1977, after an appeal set up by the Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory and supported by the Church in Wales and many Welsh academics and public figures. The trust is financed through membership subscriptions, grants and donations, and is dedicated to protecting the wildlife, buildings and archaeological sites of the island; promoting its artistic and cultural life; and encouraging people to visit as a place of natural beauty and pilgrimage.

When, in 2000, the trust advertised for a tenant for the sheep farm on the island, they had 1,100 applications. The tenancy was held by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds; and the land is managed to maintain the natural habitat. Oats, turnips and swedes were grown; goats, ducks, geese and chickens kept; and there is a mixed flock of sheep and Welsh Black cattle. The RSPB pulled out of the agreement when the tenancy ended.

==Bardsey apple==
A gnarled and twisted apple tree, discovered by Ian Sturrock growing by the side of &quot;Plas Bach&quot;, is believed to be the only survivor of an orchard that was tended by the monks who lived there a thousand years ago. In 1998, experts on the varieties of British apples at the National Fruit Collection in Brogdale stated that they believed this tree was the only example of a previously unrecorded cultivar, the &quot;Bardsey Apple ()&quot;. The cultivar has since been propagated by grafting and is available commercially. Since its discovery it has led to a resurgence in the discovery and propagation of other Welsh apple varieties.

==Bardsey Lighthouse==


Bardsey Lighthouse stands on the southerly tip of the island and guides vessels passing through St George&#x27;s Channel and the Irish Sea. It was built in 1821 by Joseph Nelson. Unusually for a British lighthouse, it is square in section and is painted in red and white bands. &quot;Y Storws&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Boathouse&quot;, was built a few years before the lighthouse, near to the landing place at &quot;Y Cafn&quot;.

==Wildlife==
The island was declared a National Nature Reserve in 1986, and is part of &quot;Glannau Aberdaron ac Ynys Enlli Special Protection Area&quot;. It is now a favourite birdwatching location, on the migration routes of thousands of birds. Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory, founded in 1953, The West Midlands Bird club created a bird observatory, and also saw the opportunity to studying the ecology of a small island.

The island was designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its maritime communities; internationally rare lichens; bryophyte, vascular plant and bird species; and intertidal communities. Nationally important flowering plants include sharp rush, rock sea lavender, small adder&#x27;s tongue and western clover, and the rare purple loosestrife is found in places. Two nationally rare heathland lichens are found on the slopes of &quot;Mynydd Enlli&quot;: the ciliate strap lichen and golden hair lichen; and there are over 350 lichen species in total. The leafcutter bee, named after its habit of cutting neat, rounded circles in rose leaves, used to seal the entrance to its nest, is native.

Thousands of birds pass through each year on their way to their breeding or wintering grounds. Chiffchaffs, goldcrests and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, whitethroats and spotted flycatchers.

About thirty species of bird regularly nest on the island, including ravens, little owls, oystercatchers and the rare chough. Hundreds of seabirds, including razorbills, guillemots, fulmars and kittiwakes, spend the summer nesting on the island&#x27;s eastern cliffs, the numbers reflecting the fact that there are no land predators such as rats or foxes to worry about. On a dark moonless night an eerie cackling can be heard across the island as 30,000 pairs of Manx shearwaters, come ashore to lay and incubate their eggs in abandoned rabbit warrens or newly dug burrows.

The island is one of the best places in Gwynedd to see grey seals. In mid-summer over two hundred can be seen, sunbathing on the rocks or bobbing in the sea, and about 60 pups are born each autumn. Their sharp teeth and strong jaws are perfect for breaking the shells of lobsters and crabs which dwell in the waters. It is also possible to spot bottlenose and Risso&#x27;s dolphins, and porpoises. The currents around the island are responsible for flushing in food-rich waters, and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has been carrying out surveys since 1999 to find out which areas are particularly important for feeding and nursing calves.

The seas around the island are rich in marine life. There are forests of strap seaweed; in the rock pools are sea anemones, crabs and small fish; and in deeper waters, the rocks are covered by sponges and sea squirts. The yellow star anemone, found offshore, is more common to the Mediterranean.

==Culture==
===King of Bardsey===

It was tradition for the island to elect the &quot;King of Bardsey&quot; (), and from 1826 onwards, he would be crowned by Baron Newborough or his representative. 

In 1925, at the age of 80, Love Pritchard was concerned about the future of the crown, and wanted it to be kept at the National Museum Cardiff in Wales.
However, against king Love&#x27;s wishes, the Wynn family sold the crown to the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool, England in 1986 where it was stored until 2000, when it was requested by Gwynedd Council to display in a &#x27;special exhibition&#x27;; it has since been loaned to Storiel gallery in Bangor. 

The first known title holder was John Williams; his son, John Williams II, the third of the recorded kings, was deposed in 1900, and asked to leave the island as he had become an alcoholic. At the outbreak of the First World War, the last king, Love Pritchard, offered himself and the men of Bardsey Island for military service, but he was refused as he was considered too old at the age of 71. Pritchard took umbrage, and declared the island a neutral power. In 1925, Pritchard left the island for the mainland, to seek a less laborious way of life, but died the following year.

===Notable residents===
Dilys Cadwaladr, a former schoolteacher on the island, in 1953 became the first woman to win the &quot;Crown&quot; at the National Eisteddfod, for her long poem . Artist Brenda Chamberlain twice won the &quot;Gold Medal for Art&quot; at the Eisteddfod; in 1951 for &quot;Girl with Siamese Cat&quot;, and in 1953 with &quot;The Christin Children&quot;. Some of the murals she painted can still be seen on the walls of , her home from 1947 to 1962. Wildlife artist Kim Atkinson, whose work has been widely exhibited in Wales and England, spent her childhood on the island and returned to live there in the 1980s.

Yorkshire-born poet Christine Evans lived half of each year on Bardsey Island. She moved to Pwllheli as a teacher, and married into a Bardsey Island farming family. Since 1998 ornithologist Steven Stansfield, has been the Warden and more recently Director of Operations of the Bardsey Bird and Field Observatory.

Since 1999, the Bardsey Island Trust has appointed an &#x27;Artist in Residence&#x27; to spend several weeks on the island producing work which is later exhibited on the mainland. A Welsh literary residence was created in 2002; singer-songwriter Fflur Dafydd spent six weeks working on a collection of poetry and prose. Her play &quot;Hugo&quot; was inspired by her stay, and she has produced two novels, (), which won the prose medal at the 2006 Eisteddfod; and &quot;Twenty Thousand Saints&quot;, winner of the &quot;Oxfam Hay Prize&quot;, which tells how the women of the island, starved of men, turn to each other.

===Film===
*Edgar Ewart Pritchard, an amateur filmmaker from Brownhills, produced &quot;The Island in the Current&quot;, a colour film of life on Bardsey Island, in 1953. A copy of the film is held by the National Screen and Sound Archive of Wales.

===Literature===
James Rollins&#x27; sixth Sigma Force novel, &quot;The Doomsday Key&quot; (2009), refers to Bardsey and its mythology.

Crime writer Mark Billingham set his 2014 novel, &quot;The Bones Beneath&quot;, on Bardsey. He includes notes on the island at the end of the book, which is one in his series of Tom Thorne novels.

===Music===
*Opera singer Bryn Terfel, a patron of the Bardsey Island Trust, has performed in the island&#x27;s chapel.
*Triple harpist Llio Rhydderch released (2002), an album inspired by the spiritual emotions evoked on the pilgrimages.

==Transport==
Passenger ferry services to Bardsey Island are operated from Porth Meudwy and Pwllheli by Bardsey Boat Trips and Enlli Charters. At times, the wind and the fierce sea currents make sailing between the island and the mainland impossible. Sometimes boats are unable to reach or leave Bardsey Island for many days; seventeen visitors were stranded for two weeks in 2000 when gales prevented a boat from going to rescue them.

<doc id="620077" wikidata="Q6929360" url="?curid=620077" title="Mr Benn">
<text>Mr Benn is a character, created by David McKee, who originally appeared in several children&#x27;s books. The first, &quot;Mr Benn Red Knight&quot;, was published in 1967, followed by three more; these became the basis for an animated television series of the same name originally transmitted by the BBC from 1971 to 1972.

In both the books and the television series, Mr Benn&#x27;s adventures take on a similar pattern. Mr Benn, a man wearing a black lounge suit and bowler hat, leaves his house at 52 Festive Road, London, and visits a fancy-dress costume shop where he is invited by the moustachioed, fez-wearing shopkeeper to try on a particular outfit. He leaves the shop through a magic door at the back of the changing room and enters a world appropriate to his costume, where he has an adventure (which usually contains a moral) before the shopkeeper reappears to lead him back to the changing room, and the story comes to an end. Mr Benn returns to his normal life, but is left with a small souvenir of his magical adventure. Additionally, scenes before and after his adventure usually have some connection to it, such as the games the children are playing in the street as he passes.

==Books==

David McKee got the inspiration for Mr Benn from Festing Road in Putney where he used to live. McKee had the house &quot;next door&quot; at 54 Festing Road, where residents installed an engraved paving slab in his honour on 26 November 2009. (&quot;I think it was because in the first book I drew myself looking out of the window, and I thought it would be quite nice to have him next door&quot;, said McKee.)

McKee said he had always thought of Mr Benn as having the first name William.

Mr Benn&#x27;s adventures are available to buy in book-form: four were published originally, and further books in the 1990s were based on the television series. The original four books were: &quot;Mr Benn – Red Knight&quot;, &quot;Big Game Benn&quot;, &quot;123456789 Benn&quot;, and &quot;Big Top Benn&quot;. There were six original books planned, but the fifth and sixth were never published. The fifth was called &quot;Mr Benn Rides Again&quot;, the story of which was used to make the television episode &quot;The Cowboy&quot;. The sixth, never completed, was &quot;Superbenn&quot;, in which the superhero Mr Benn sets out on an environmental adventure.

There is one book for which no corresponding television episode has () been made. &quot;123456789 Benn&quot; was published in 1970 () and tells the story of Mr Benn as a convict (hence the number) inspiring his jail-mates to brighten up their cells. This was after the BBC – who screened the television series – felt that the story was too mature for a children&#x27;s series.

A new story was published in 2001, the first Mr Benn story that McKee had written in thirty years, and is called &quot;Mr Benn – Gladiator&quot; (). McKee indicated that he might write more Mr Benn stories, but none were published before his death.

In 2001 &quot;Mr Benn&#x27;s Little Book of Life&quot; was published by Tess Read, which explores the lessons of Mr Benn&#x27;s adventures.

The only character who appears several times, apart from Mr Benn and the shopkeeper, is Smasher Lagru. Smasher first appears as an inmate in &quot;123456789 Benn&quot;, and then after his release in &quot;Big-Top Benn&quot; and the new &quot;Mr Benn – Gladiator&quot;.

A &quot;Mr Benn Annual&quot; () was published by Polystyle Publications Ltd in 1972. It was written by Jan Falconer and illustrated by David McKee. This contained a number of illustrated text stories, three strip-cartoon style adventures and a few puzzle pages. Mr Benn visits: China for a kite festival, a fairytale Arabia, Venice and Holland. He also becomes a barrow boy in a pearly suit and meets Mr Grubbly and his animal friends in the African jungle.

Tate Publishing republished all of the original books in 2010.

==Television ==

McKee wrote and animated (with Ian Lawless) thirteen &quot;Mr Benn&quot; episodes for the BBC between 1971 and 1972. These episodes were repeated twice a year for 21 years with further repeats airing in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2000. The episodes were narrated by Ray Brooks. The music is credited as composed by Don Warren, which was a pseudonym for Duncan Lamont.

McKee did not benefit financially to the extent he might have: &quot;I signed a contract where I only got a one-off payment and no repeat fees, but I&#x27;ve done quite well from a number of other things and I&#x27;m still exhibiting paintings.&quot; According to &quot;Mr Benn&#x27;s Little Book of Life&quot;, very little of McKee&#x27;s original artwork created for the television episodes exists today, as most of it was thrown into a rubbish skip in the 1970s.

After over thirty years, a brand new Mr Benn episode was screened for the first time on 1 January 2005, on Nick Jr. UK&#x27;s evening block Noggin. The episode was based on McKee&#x27;s 2001 book &quot;Mr Benn - Gladiator&quot;.

The series was voted the sixth most popular children&#x27;s television programme in the 2001 Channel 4 poll &quot;100 Greatest Kids&#x27; TV shows&quot;. It was also rated number 13 in the &quot;50 Greatest Kids TV Shows&quot; which aired on Channel 5 on 8 November 2013.

===Episode listing===

The first six episodes of &quot;Mr Benn&quot; were broadcast Thursday afternoons on BBC1 at 1:30pm from 25 February to 1 April 1971. When the final seven episodes aired Friday afternoons on BBC1 at 1:30pm from 21 January to 31 March 1972 the first six were shown again but in a different order.

Four of the episodes were billed with alternate titles in &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

The one-off special episode based on the final Mr Benn book called &quot;Gladiator&quot; was broadcast on The Noggin Channel (a Nick Jr. channel of classic shows as part of the Nickelodeon franchise) in 2005.

==Other appearances==
===Film===
In 1999, it was reported that a feature film was in development and that director Jevon O&#x27;Neill’s production company, Erinfilm, had purchased the film rights to Mr Benn from David McKee. The film was to star John Hannah as Mr Benn and Ben Kingsley as the Shopkeeper. However, the film was cancelled in 2001 and, as of 2017, the project remains dormant. In an interview with the BBC in May 2014, McKee stated that, on a film version: &quot;I&#x27;d like to see that [the film] happen, because Mr Benn&#x27;s a big boy and he can live his own life. I think he&#x27;s right for being developed on the big screen&quot;.

===Theatrical adaptation===
Mr Benn was adapted for the stage by Tall Stories Theatre Company. It was first performed at the 2011 Edinburgh Fringe and toured until 2013.

===DVD release===
: Title: &quot;Mr Benn: The Complete Series&quot;
:Label: Contender Home Entertainment
:Release Date: 2005
:Catalogue N°: CTD10390
:Availability: In Print

===Advertising===

In 1993, a popular advert for &#x27;R Whites Lemonade&#x27;, &#x27;Secret Lemonade Drinker&#x27;, was subverted by having &#x27;The Shop Keeper&#x27; appear, who takes the &#x27;Secret Lemonade Drinker&#x27; back to the changing room, where he is revealed to be Mr Benn on an adventure. As Mr Benn returns to Festive Avenue, all the children in the avenue are drinking R Whites Lemonade. The advert was narrated by Ray Brooks.

In 2013 Mr Benn appeared in an advert for &#x27;Mr Porter.com&#x27;, an on line clothing retailer. The advert was called Mr Benn at Christmas&#x27;

In January 2018, The Insurance Emporium launched its first national TV ad featuring Mr Benn. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; observed that the ad followed a current trend in the UK of using nostalgic cartoon characters in adverts such as Lloyds Bank subsidiary, Halifax. The first advert featured Mr Benn and a new supporting character, Eddie the dog. It was the first time new content of Mr Benn had aired on British televisions since 2005. The three supporting characters were The Shopkeeper, Eddie the dog and Gus the gorilla.

===Clothing accessories===

In 2017, Turnbull &amp; Asser launched 3 limited edition pocket squares featuring Mr Benn in a James Bond style, corresponding with an exhibition of original Mr Benn artworks at the Illustration Cupboard which at that time was next door in St James. Originally four different designs, the 2017 Westminster Attack caused the decision to not produce the final image of Mr Benn facing his adversaries outside the Houses of Parliament and next to the bridge in question. The original picture can be seen on the Illustration Cupboard blog.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; ===
The 2024 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas special &quot;Joy to the World&quot; features a shot of a statue of the Red Knight as seen in the eponymous episode of &quot;Mr Benn&quot; as well as two hats behind a glass wall on which is written &quot;Mr Benn&#x27;s any era clothes&quot;. It heavily implies that the episode was inspired by it.

<doc id="620081" wikidata="Q741656" url="?curid=620081" title="Audi A2">
<text>The Audi A2 (internally designated &quot;Typ&quot; 8Z) is a lightweight compact MPV-styled supermini car, with a five-door hatchback body style and four or five seats, produced by the German manufacturer Audi from November 1999 (for the 2000 model year) to August 2005. Based on the Audi Al2 concept car first shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1997, the A2 was notable for being constructed from aluminium, which in combination with its efficient engines made it highly fuel efficient.

Sales were disappointing, and the car was taken out of production in 2005.

==History==
The A2 was produced at Audi&#x27;s &quot;aluminium&quot; Neckarsulm plant in Germany on a special line purpose-built for it. It was the first five-door vehicle on sale in Europe with an average fuel consumption less than , although these figures only applied to the special &quot;3L&quot; version with a diesel engine, automatic gearbox, stop-start system, less power and narrower tyres. Due to its construction, the average A2 weighs 830 kg. The last A2s to be produced were built in August 2005.

==Styling==

The A2 was a surprise when it debuted only two years after the original Al2 study. Many initial reviews, including those from &quot;What Car?&quot; and &quot;Autocar&quot; in the UK commented on the design.

===Autocar&#x27;s initial drive verdict===
&quot;The best thing about the A2 is that it isn’t merely a design exercise. Yes, it’s a great car to look at, sit in and touch, but it’s also a riot to drive&quot;.

The avant-garde styling did not, however, win favour with some potential customers. Audi was reported to be disappointed with the level of sales. The final production was only 176,377 units, in comparison to rival Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s A-Class sales of 1 million.

==Design, engineering and construction==

The overriding theme in the design and engineering of the A2 was summarized by the then Audi UK product manager in an interview after the car won a design award in 2001 as &quot;create a small Audi, not a cheap Audi&quot;, and the creative brief is said to have been &quot;Transport four people from Stuttgart to Milan on a single tank of petrol&quot;.

The A2 is built with a considerable amount of aluminium and aluminium alloy, making it weigh significantly less than cars of this size, and use much less fuel than cars with traditional steel monocoques. Under certain circumstances, consumption for the 1.2 TDI model can be as low as just over . This version of the Audi A2 won the &quot;Nordic Eco Run&quot; fuel economy race in 2003, with a consumption of . Even the normal versions with petrol engines are capable of . The A2 was also notable for being the first Audi model since the 1970s Audi 50 (type 86) and Audi 100 (type 43) not to be offered with its &#x27;trademark&#x27; quattro four-wheel drive option. The A2 has a coefficient of drag of between 0.25 and 0.29, depending on the specific version.

The A2 still uses a contemporary unibody construction, with significant elements of space frame principles, and it is tagged by Audi as an &#x27;Audi Space Frame&#x27; design. The outer panels of the body have little or no structural function – similarities exist with the original Renault Espace – and the space frame bears the forces working on the car. The frame uses casts and extrusions which are laser welded together to make the space frame. Improvements in shell stability, durability and stiffness, lower weight, and more interior space are results of its construction. &quot;The A2, on the other hand, was designed as an aluminum car and the spaceframe has been optimized by parts consolidation, using large, cost-effective castings instead of aluminum stampings&quot;.

Unfortunately, the cost of working with aluminium, particularly with small production runs, meant that the A2 was more expensive than other cars in its sector, competing with the A-class and losing. Much of the high production cost was due to so many parts not being &quot;off the shelf&quot; and being specifically optimized for the A2.
From Autobild in 2003: &quot;The A2 is not one of the models with the highest return on investment&quot;. The same article quotes the sales figures for 2002 as being 20,000 in Germany against 80,000 for the A-Class and &quot;...lots of money for a car that is only 3.8m long.&quot;

Audi was the first manufacturer to try to incorporate lightweight building concepts using aluminium and associated alloys into a &quot;mass market&quot; vehicle. Previous efforts at using the Audi Space Frame were limited to the rather more expensive Audi A8. As a guide to the mass involved, the entire shell weighs so little that two people can easily pick it up, and the side panel over the doors including the A- and D-pillars weighs approximately . A 2002 model A2 with standard equipment has a mass of .

===Interior===
The A2 has a large interior space for the exterior dimensions, including a boot with of space when the rear seats are in place. This is significantly larger than the luggage space of the next model in Audi&#x27;s range, the Audi A3. Due to the &quot;sandwich&quot;-type construction, similar again to that of the Renault Espace or the Mercedes A-Class, the floorpan has an upper and a lower portion. The space in the middle is used to house various components, such as the fuel tank and the engine&#x27;s electronics. The rear passengers also benefit, as their foot space reaches into this sandwich space, creating a comfortable seating position even for tall rear seat passengers. This is in direct contrast to the comfort available on the rear bench of an A-Class. To improve the weight distribution of the vehicle, its battery is located inside the boot, under the floor.

The A2&#x27;s interior was very upmarket in comparison with other superminis. In both the UK and Europe, there were several choices of seat material and colour, comprising the standard Cirrus cloth, optional Matrix cloth, optional Alcantara/leather, or full pearl Nappa leather seat coverings. Sport models received sport seats with electrically adjustable lumbar support as standard in jacquard satin cloth.

===Service hatch (&quot;Serviceklappe&quot;)===
The front of the car included an unusual design feature called the &quot;Serviceklappe&quot; in German – this translates to &quot;service hatch&quot; or &quot;service panel&quot;. On early cars, this was a glossy black panel at the lower edge of the bonnet, where the radiator grille would normally be sited. Behind it are the filling points for oil and windshield washer fluid, and the dipstick.

The bonnet was widely rumoured to be sealed – &quot;Car and Driver&quot; wrote: &quot;...feature of the A2 that may foretell the future: the sealed hood&quot;. Actually, the bonnet is easily removed, being held in place by two twist-lock catches. The bonnet, weighing 8 kg, then comes away from the car altogether, unlike the usual hinged flip-up arrangement on most other cars. Due to the service hatch, the bonnet does not need to be removed frequently for access to the engine.

==Facelift and additional models==
The service hatch is the most obvious indicator of the age of any particular A2. It was changed to matte black for the &quot;color.storm&quot; colour schemes, and for model year 2004 it acquired fake grille slats. However it can be changed easily, so it should not be taken as a reliable age indicator.
Very little else was changed externally during the life of the car. Colours and wheels designs were changed mildly during the production run. The only other external indicator of the age of the car is the windscreen wiper. Very early models have a traditional blade, but starting in model year 2002, newer cars have a &quot;flex&quot; version (&quot;Aerotwin&quot; from Bosch, model 760).

===Changes and additions===


===2000–2001===
* February 2000: introduction of the A2 with petrol engine
* September 2000: introduction of the diesel
* June 2001: introduction of the 1.2 TDI engine in 3L into mainland European market.

===2002–2003===
* CAN-BUS is used for the OBD systems, as required by EU Regulations.
* Aerotwin wiper
* Aluminium trim pack becomes standard equipment in the UK
* Diesel-engined A2s after May 2002 no longer have a pre-heater run by diesel, but a powerful internal electrical heating element.
* May 2002: Use of the 42l petrol tank in all non 3l versions. 3l available with 21l standard tank or 34l tank, allowing a theoretical 1100 km range.
* June 2002: 1.6 FSI engine introduced with the larger (42l) petrol tank and re-modelled rear spoiler (higher position, larger size to increase high speed stability). Non S-line FSI&#x27;s featured re-tuned softer suspension tuning due to many complaints over the harsh ride of other models
* The first color.storms (in &#x27;Misano&#x27; red, &#x27;Imola&#x27; yellow and &#x27;Sprint&#x27; blue) became available. These brought colours which had only previously been available on S and RS models or as an Audi Exclusive option to the standard colour chart.
* Diesel engines used after September 2003, engine code BHC, fulfil the requirements for Euro4 exhaust emissions, again as a result of legislation.
* Spare tyre and tyre repair kit delete becomes a paid-for optional extra in the UK

===2003–2004===
* Extended color.storm colour options, including &#x27;Papaya&#x27; orange and later &#x27;Avus&#x27; silver
* September / October 2003: Availability of the TDI. Grille now with slats (but still solid), new Matrix cloth replaces both satellite and jacquard-satin cloth, yellow leather no longer available, additional external colours available including Akoya Silver and Mauritius Blue, New Wheel designs became available
* Use of MK60 ESP / ABS system.
* FSI and TDI engines phased out towards late 2004/early 2005

===2005===
* Special Edition (including CD player and climate control) models introduced into UK markets, at this time no other models were available in the UK
* Audi lost an estimated £4,000 on every A2 they sold and only made money on cars with optional extras. Continued production of the model was reviewed by the board of directors
* Production of the A2 is halted by VW/Audi group boss Bernd Pischetsrieder. Overall, Audi lost €7,530 per vehicle produced.

===Lekker/DBM electric version===
In October 2010, an A2 converted to electric power by Lekker Energie and DBM Energy completed an early morning drive from Munich to Berlin on a single charge. Upon arrival, Rainer Bruederle, Germany&#x27;s Economics Minister, called the test drive a &quot;world record.&quot;

The car was said to still have 18% of its charge remaining on arrival in Berlin and the average speed was reported as being 90 km/h (56 mph). The &quot;kolibri&quot; batteries used in the design are so compact that the vehicle retains its four seats and boot space. A production version would be possible. &quot;The technology could be implemented today. It is up to industry to use this potential,&quot; commented Mirko Hannemann, the head of DBM.

==1.2 TDI &quot;3L&quot;==
The Audi A2 1.2 TDI had the lowest drag coefficient of any car in the world at the time of its launch. It was also one of the most economical and least polluting, only emitting 81 g/km (German emission standard D4) to 86 g/km (D3 emission standard) emissions. The Audi A2 3L reuses the engine and special gearbox developed for the equally efficient Volkswagen Lupo 1.2 TDI 3L.

Two versions of the car were available in Germany during its production run. The D4 version, which used only , was &quot;standard.&quot; It had no power steering, air conditioning or other extras, with the only optional extra being body coloured door handles and wing mirrors. There were no optional extras because optional equipment adds weight and therefore reduces economy. It had a fixed rear seat cushion. The tested fuel economy was 2.88 L/100 km.

The second version was a D3 version which was still capable of 3.0 L/100 km. This version had options for air conditioning, a winter package, and a comfort package, but was not available in all markets.

Both versions had thinner glass, lighter seats, and 14&quot; magnesium alloy wheels. The standard tyre fitment was 145/80 R14 T76 Bridgestone Ecopias or Continental Winter Tyres using very flat wheel covers to minimize turbulence. The engine block was also made from a light alloy, so even though it was a diesel, it weighed just .

The car had an automated manual transmission with a Tiptronic mode on the selector.
The car also had an ECO mode. When engaged it limited the power to (excluding kick down) and programmed the transmission to change up at the most economical point. ECO mode also activated the start/stop function, a feature that was new to European cars at the time.

A total of 6450 1.2 TDI models were built. 

==Technical specifications==
The following internal combustion engines were available:
==A2 Concept (2011)==

At the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011, Audi exhibited an entirely electric concept car, the &quot;A2 concept&quot;, previewing an expected new A2 production model. The superstructure made largely from aluminium, additional parts in Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymer, and other construction techniques restrain the weight to only 1,150 kg.

A lithium-ion battery placed between the floor holds 24 kWh of usable charge. An electric motor is transversely mounted at the front of the vehicle, the electric motor delivers through the front wheels and uses a single-speed transmission. The vehicle will also incorporate shift-by-wire, brake-by-wire and steer-by-wire contactless technology, and LED matrix technology for the headlights and tail lights.

In June 2012, the UK&#x27;s &quot;Car Magazine&quot; reported that Audi had put the electric A2 project on hold indefinitely, following disappointing European sales of other EVs, like the Nissan Leaf &amp; Mitsubishi i-MiEV, and a projected retail price of over €40,000.

It was reported that, according to the director of e-mobility and sustainability strategy at Audi of America, the A2 electric concept was not a developmental prototype with a test program, but a one-off concept car to be shown at auto shows.

<doc id="620083" wikidata="Q1889114" url="?curid=620083" title="Sensitivity analysis">
<text>Sensitivity analysis is the study of how the uncertainty in the output of a mathematical model or system (numerical or otherwise) can be divided and allocated to different sources of uncertainty in its inputs. This involves estimating sensitivity indices that quantify the influence of an input or group of inputs on the output. A related practice is uncertainty analysis, which has a greater focus on uncertainty quantification and propagation of uncertainty; ideally, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis should be run in tandem.

==Motivation==

A mathematical model (for example in biology, climate change, economics, renewable energy, agronomy...) can be highly complex, and as a result, its relationships between inputs and outputs may be faultily understood. In such cases, the model can be viewed as a black box, i.e. the output is an &quot;opaque&quot; function of its inputs. Quite often, some or all of the model inputs are subject to sources of uncertainty, including errors of measurement, errors in input data, parameter estimation and approximation procedure, absence of information and poor or partial understanding of the driving forces and mechanisms, choice of underlying hypothesis of model, and so on. This uncertainty limits our confidence in the reliability of the model&#x27;s response or output. Further, models may have to cope with the natural intrinsic variability of the system (aleatory), such as the occurrence of stochastic events.

In models involving many input variables, sensitivity analysis is an essential ingredient of model building and quality assurance and can be useful to determine the impact of a uncertain variable for a range of purposes, including:

* Testing the robustness of the results of a model or system in the presence of uncertainty.
* Increased understanding of the relationships between input and output variables in a system or model.
* Uncertainty reduction, through the identification of model input that cause significant uncertainty in the output and should therefore be the focus of attention in order to increase robustness.
* Searching for errors in the model (by encountering unexpected relationships between inputs and outputs).
* Model simplification – fixing model input that has no effect on the output, or identifying and removing redundant parts of the model structure.
* Enhancing communication from modelers to decision makers (e.g. by making recommendations more credible, understandable, compelling or persuasive).
* Finding regions in the space of input factors for which the model output is either maximum or minimum or meets some optimum criterion (see optimization and Monte Carlo filtering).
* For calibration of models with large number of parameters, by focusing on the sensitive parameters.
* To identify important connections between observations, model inputs, and predictions or forecasts, leading to the development of better models.

== Mathematical formulation and vocabulary ==

The object of study for sensitivity analysis is a function formula_1, (called &quot;mathematical model&quot; or &quot;programming code&quot;), viewed as a black box, with the formula_2-dimensional input vector formula_3 and the output formula_4, presented as following:

formula_5

The variability in input parameters formula_6 have an impact on the output formula_4. While uncertainty analysis aims to describe the distribution of the output formula_4 (providing its statistics, moments, pdf, cdf...), sensitivity analysis aims to measure and quantify the impact of each input formula_9 or a group of inputs on the variability of the output formula_4 (by calculating the corresponding sensitivity indices). Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of this statement.

==Challenges, settings and related issues==

Taking into account uncertainty arising from different sources, whether in the context of uncertainty analysis or sensitivity analysis (for calculating sensitivity indices), requires multiple samples of the uncertain parameters and, consequently, running the model (evaluating the formula_1-function) multiple times. Depending on the complexity of the model there are many challenges that may be encountered during model evaluation. Therefore, the choice of method of sensitivity analysis is typically dictated by a number of problem constraints, settings or challenges. Some of the most common are:

* Computational expense: Sensitivity analysis is almost always performed by running the model a (possibly large) number of times, i.e. a sampling-based approach. This can be a significant problem when:
** Time-consuming models are very often encountered when complex models are involved. A single run of the model takes a significant amount of time (minutes, hours or longer). The use of statistical model (meta-model, data-driven model) including HDMR to approximate the formula_1-function is one way of reducing the computation costs.
** The model has a large number of uncertain inputs. Sensitivity analysis is essentially the exploration of the multidimensional input space, which grows exponentially in size with the number of inputs. Therefore, screening methods can be useful for dimension reduction. Another way to tackle the curse of dimensionality is to use sampling based on low discrepancy sequences. 
* Correlated inputs: Most common sensitivity analysis methods assume independence between model inputs, but sometimes inputs can be strongly correlated. Correlations between inputs must then be taken into account in the analysis.
* Nonlinearity: Some sensitivity analysis approaches, such as those based on linear regression, can inaccurately measure sensitivity when the model response is nonlinear with respect to its inputs. In such cases, variance-based measures are more appropriate.
* Multiple or functional outputs: Generally introduced for single-output codes, sensitivity analysis extends to cases where the output formula_4 is a vector or function. When outputs are correlated, it does not preclude the possibility of performing different sensitivity analyses for each output of interest. However, for models in which the outputs are correlated, the sensitivity measures can be hard to interpret.
* Stochastic code: A code is said to be stochastic when, for several evaluations of the code with the same inputs, different outputs are obtained (as opposed to a deterministic code when, for several evaluations of the code with the same inputs, the same output is always obtained). In this case, it is necessary to separate the variability of the output due to the variability of the inputs from that due to stochasticity.

* Data-driven approach: Sometimes it is not possible to evaluate the code at all desired points, either because the code is confidential or because the experiment is not reproducible. The code output is only available for a given set of points, and it can be difficult to perform a sensitivity analysis on a limited set of data. We then build a statistical model (meta-model, data-driven model) from the available data (that we use for training) to approximate the code (the formula_1-function).

To address the various constraints and challenges, a number of methods for sensitivity analysis have been proposed in the literature, which we will examine in the next section.

== Sensitivity analysis methods ==
There are a large number of approaches to performing a sensitivity analysis, many of which have been developed to address one or more of the constraints discussed above. They are also distinguished by the type of sensitivity measure, be it based on (for example) variance decompositions, partial derivatives or elementary effects. In general, however, most procedures adhere to the following outline:

# Quantify the uncertainty in each input (e.g. ranges, probability distributions). Note that this can be difficult and many methods exist to elicit uncertainty distributions from subjective data.
# Identify the model output to be analysed (the target of interest should ideally have a direct relation to the problem tackled by the model).
# Run the model a number of times using some design of experiments, dictated by the method of choice and the input uncertainty.
# Using the resulting model outputs, calculate the sensitivity measures of interest.

In some cases this procedure will be repeated, for example in high-dimensional problems where the user has to screen out unimportant variables before performing a full sensitivity analysis.

The various types of &quot;core methods&quot; (discussed below) are distinguished by the various sensitivity measures which are calculated. These categories can somehow overlap. Alternative ways of obtaining these measures, under the constraints of the problem, can be given. In addition, an engineering view of the methods that takes into account the four important sensitivity analysis parameters has also been proposed.

=== Visual analysis ===
The first intuitive approach (especially useful in less complex cases) is to analyze the relationship between each input formula_15 and the output formula_4 using scatter plots, and observe the behavior of these pairs. The diagrams give an initial idea of the correlation and which input has an impact on the output. Figure 2 shows an example where two inputs, formula_17 and formula_18 are highly correlated with the output.

=== One-at-a-time (OAT) ===

One of the simplest and most common approaches is that of changing one-factor-at-a-time (OAT), to see what effect this produces on the output. OAT customarily involves

* moving one input variable, keeping others at their baseline (nominal) values, then,
* returning the variable to its nominal value, then repeating for each of the other inputs in the same way.

Sensitivity may then be measured by monitoring changes in the output, e.g. by partial derivatives or linear regression. This appears a logical approach as any change observed in the output will unambiguously be due to the single variable changed. Furthermore, by changing one variable at a time, one can keep all other variables fixed to their central or baseline values. This increases the comparability of the results (all &#x27;effects&#x27; are computed with reference to the same central point in space) and minimizes the chances of computer program crashes, more likely when several input factors are changed simultaneously.
OAT is frequently preferred by modelers because of practical reasons. In case of model failure under OAT analysis the modeler immediately knows which is the input factor responsible for the failure.

Despite its simplicity however, this approach does not fully explore the input space, since it does not take into account the simultaneous variation of input variables. This means that the OAT approach cannot detect the presence of interactions between input variables and is unsuitable for nonlinear models.

The proportion of input space which remains unexplored with an OAT approach grows superexponentially with the number of inputs. For example, a 3-variable parameter space which is explored one-at-a-time is equivalent to taking points along the x, y, and z axes of a cube centered at the origin. The convex hull bounding all these points is an octahedron which has a volume only 1/6th of the total parameter space. More generally, the convex hull of the axes of a hyperrectangle forms a hyperoctahedron which has a volume fraction of formula_19. With 5 inputs, the explored space already drops to less than 1% of the total parameter space. And even this is an overestimate, since the off-axis volume is not actually being sampled at all. Compare this to random sampling of the space, where the convex hull approaches the entire volume as more points are added. While the sparsity of OAT is theoretically not a concern for linear models, true linearity is rare in nature.

=== Morris ===
Named after the statistician Max D. Morris, this method is suitable for screening systems with many parameters. This is also known as method of elementary effects because it combines repeated steps along the various parametric axes.

=== Derivative-based local methods ===
Local derivative-based methods involve taking the partial derivative of the output formula_4 with respect to an input factor formula_9:
:formula_22
where the subscript x0 indicates that the derivative is taken at some fixed point in the space of the input (hence the &#x27;local&#x27; in the name of the class). Adjoint modelling and Automated Differentiation are methods which allow to compute all partial derivatives at a cost at most 4-6 times of that for evaluating the original function. Similar to OAT, local methods do not attempt to fully explore the input space, since they examine small perturbations, typically one variable at a time. It is possible to select similar samples from derivative-based sensitivity through Neural Networks and perform uncertainty quantification.

One advantage of the local methods is that it is possible to make a matrix to represent all the sensitivities in a system, thus providing an overview that cannot be achieved with global methods if there is a large number of input and output variables.

=== Regression analysis ===
Regression analysis, in the context of sensitivity analysis, involves fitting a linear regression to the model response and using standardized regression coefficients as direct measures of sensitivity. The regression is required to be linear with respect to the data (i.e. a hyperplane, hence with no quadratic terms, etc., as regressors) because otherwise it is difficult to interpret the standardised coefficients. This method is therefore most suitable when the model response is in fact linear; linearity can be confirmed, for instance, if the coefficient of determination is large. The advantages of regression analysis are that it is simple and has a low computational cost.

=== Variance-based methods ===
Variance-based methods are a class of probabilistic approaches which quantify the input and output uncertainties as random variables, represented via their probability distributions, and decompose the output variance into parts attributable to input variables and combinations of variables. The sensitivity of the output to an input variable is therefore measured by the amount of variance in the output caused by that input.

This amount is quantified and calculated using Sobol indices: they represent the proportion of variance explained by an input or group of inputs. This expression essentially measures the contribution of formula_9 alone to the uncertainty (variance) in formula_4 (averaged over variations in other variables), and is known as the &quot;first-order sensitivity index&quot; or &quot;main effect index&quot; or &quot;main Sobol index&quot; or &quot;Sobol main index&quot; .

For an input formula_9, Sobol index is defined as following:

formula_26 where formula_27 and formula_28 denote the variance and expected value operators respectively.

Importantly, first-order sensitivity index of formula_9 does not measure the uncertainty caused by interactions formula_9 has with other variables. A further measure, known as the &quot;total effect index&quot; , gives the total variance in formula_4 caused by formula_9 and its interactions with any of the other input variables. The total effect index is given as following: formula_33where formula_34 denotes the set of all input variables except formula_9.

Variance-based methods allow full exploration of the input space, accounting for interactions, and nonlinear responses. For these reasons they are widely used when it is feasible to calculate them. Typically this calculation involves the use of Monte Carlo methods, but since this can involve many thousands of model runs, other methods (such as metamodels) can be used to reduce computational expense when necessary.

=== Moment-independent methods ===
Moment-independent methods extend variance-based techniques by considering the probability density or cumulative distribution function of the model output formula_4. Thus, they do not refer to any particular moment of formula_4, whence the name.

The moment-independent sensitivity measures of formula_9, here denoted by formula_39, can be defined through an equation similar to variance-based indices replacing the conditional expectation with a distance, as formula_40, where formula_41 is a statistical distance [metric or divergence] between probability measures, formula_42 and formula_43 are the marginal and conditional probability measures of formula_4.
If formula_45 is a distance, the moment-independent global sensitivity measure satisfies zero-independence. This is a relevant statistical property also known as Renyi&#x27;s postulate D.

The class of moment-independent sensitivity measures includes indicators such as the formula_46 -importance measure, the new correlation coefficient of Chatterjee, the Wasserstein correlation of Wiesel and the kernel-based sensitivity measures of Barr and Rabitz.

Another measure for global sensitivity analysis, in the category of moment-independent approaches, is the PAWN index. 

=== Variogram analysis of response surfaces (&quot;VARS&quot;) ===
One of the major shortcomings of the previous sensitivity analysis methods is that none of them considers the spatially ordered structure of the response surface/output of the model formula_47 in the parameter space. By utilizing the concepts of directional variograms and covariograms, variogram analysis of response surfaces (VARS) addresses this weakness through recognizing a spatially continuous correlation structure to the values of formula_4, and hence also to the values of formula_49.

Basically, the higher the variability the more heterogeneous is the response surface along a particular direction/parameter, at a specific perturbation scale. Accordingly, in the VARS framework, the values of directional variograms for a given perturbation scale can be considered as a comprehensive illustration of sensitivity information, through linking variogram analysis to both direction and perturbation scale concepts. As a result, the VARS framework accounts for the fact that sensitivity is a scale-dependent concept, and thus overcomes the scale issue of traditional sensitivity analysis methods. More importantly, VARS is able to provide relatively stable and statistically robust estimates of parameter sensitivity with much lower computational cost than other strategies (about two orders of magnitude more efficient). Noteworthy, it has been shown that there is a theoretical link between the VARS framework and the variance-based and derivative-based approaches.

=== Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) ===
The Fourier amplitude sensitivity test (FAST) uses the Fourier series to represent a multivariate function (the model) in the frequency domain, using a single frequency variable. Therefore, the integrals required to calculate sensitivity indices become univariate, resulting in computational savings.

=== Shapley effects ===
Shapley effects rely on Shapley values and represent the average marginal contribution of a given factors across all possible combinations of factors. These value are related to Sobol’s indices as their value falls between the first order Sobol’ effect and the total order effect.

=== Chaos polynomials ===
The principle is to project the function of interest onto a basis of orthogonal polynomials. The Sobol indices are then expressed analytically in terms of the coefficients of this decomposition.

== Complementary research approaches for time-consuming simulations ==
A number of methods have been developed to overcome some of the constraints discussed above, which would otherwise make the estimation of sensitivity measures infeasible (most often due to computational expense). Generally, these methods focus on efficiently (by creating a metamodel of the costly function to be evaluated and/or by “ wisely ” sampling the factor space) calculating variance-based measures of sensitivity.

=== Metamodels ===
Metamodels (also known as emulators, surrogate models or response surfaces) are data-modeling/machine learning approaches that involve building a relatively simple mathematical function, known as an &quot;metamodels&quot;, that approximates the input/output behavior of the model itself. In other words, it is the concept of &quot;modeling a model&quot; (hence the name &quot;metamodel&quot;). The idea is that, although computer models may be a very complex series of equations that can take a long time to solve, they can always be regarded as a function of their inputs formula_47. By running the model at a number of points in the input space, it may be possible to fit a much simpler metamodels formula_51, such that formula_52 to within an acceptable margin of error. Then, sensitivity measures can be calculated from the metamodel (either with Monte Carlo or analytically), which will have a negligible additional computational cost. Importantly, the number of model runs required to fit the metamodel can be orders of magnitude less than the number of runs required to directly estimate the sensitivity measures from the model.

Clearly, the crux of an metamodel approach is to find an formula_51 (metamodel) that is a sufficiently close approximation to the model formula_54. This requires the following steps,
# Sampling (running) the model at a number of points in its input space. This requires a sample design.
# Selecting a type of emulator (mathematical function) to use.
# &quot;Training&quot; the metamodel using the sample data from the model – this generally involves adjusting the metamodel parameters until the metamodel mimics the true model as well as possible.

Sampling the model can often be done with low-discrepancy sequences, such as the Sobol sequence – due to mathematician Ilya M. Sobol or Latin hypercube sampling, although random designs can also be used, at the loss of some efficiency. The selection of the metamodel type and the training are intrinsically linked since the training method will be dependent on the class of metamodel. Some types of metamodels that have been used successfully for sensitivity analysis include:

* Gaussian processes (also known as kriging), where any combination of output points is assumed to be distributed as a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Recently, &quot;treed&quot; Gaussian processes have been used to deal with heteroscedastic and discontinuous responses.
* Random forests, in which a large number of decision trees are trained, and the result averaged.
* Gradient boosting, where a succession of simple regressions are used to weight data points to sequentially reduce error.
* Polynomial chaos expansions, which use orthogonal polynomials to approximate the response surface.
* Smoothing splines, normally used in conjunction with high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) truncations (see below).
* Discrete Bayesian networks, in conjunction with canonical models such as noisy models. Noisy models exploit information on the conditional independence between variables to significantly reduce dimensionality.

The use of an emulator introduces a machine learning problem, which can be difficult if the response of the model is highly nonlinear. In all cases, it is useful to check the accuracy of the emulator, for example using cross-validation.

=== High-dimensional model representations (HDMR) ===
A high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) (the term is due to H. Rabitz) is essentially an emulator approach, which involves decomposing the function output into a linear combination of input terms and interactions of increasing dimensionality. The HDMR approach exploits the fact that the model can usually be well-approximated by neglecting higher-order interactions (second or third-order and above). The terms in the truncated series can then each be approximated by e.g. polynomials or splines (REFS) and the response expressed as the sum of the main effects and interactions up to the truncation order. From this perspective, HDMRs can be seen as emulators which neglect high-order interactions; the advantage is that they are able to emulate models with higher dimensionality than full-order emulators.

=== Monte Carlo filtering ===
Sensitivity analysis via Monte Carlo filtering is also a sampling-based approach, whose objective is to identify regions in the space of the input factors corresponding to particular values (e.g., high or low) of the output.

==Related concepts==
Sensitivity analysis is closely related with uncertainty analysis; while the latter studies the overall uncertainty in the conclusions of the study, sensitivity analysis tries to identify what source of uncertainty weighs more on the study&#x27;s conclusions.

The problem setting in sensitivity analysis also has strong similarities with the field of design of experiments. In a design of experiments, one studies the effect of some process or intervention (the &#x27;treatment&#x27;) on some objects (the &#x27;experimental units&#x27;). In sensitivity analysis one looks at the effect of varying the inputs of a mathematical model on the output of the model itself. In both disciplines one strives to obtain information from the system with a minimum of physical or numerical experiments.

==Sensitivity auditing==

It may happen that a sensitivity analysis of a model-based study is meant to underpin an inference, and to certify its robustness, in a context where the inference feeds into a policy or decision-making process. In these cases the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become a matter of great importance, and a pure sensitivity analysis – with its emphasis on parametric uncertainty – may be seen as insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may derive inter-alia from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about &#x27;what the problem is&#x27; and foremost about &#x27;who is telling the story&#x27;. Most often the framing includes more or less implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).

In order to take these concerns into due consideration the instruments of SA have been extended to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge and model generating process. This approach has been called &#x27;sensitivity auditing&#x27;. It takes inspiration from NUSAP, a method used to qualify the worth of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees&#x27; of numbers. Sensitivity auditing has been especially designed for an adversarial context, where not only the nature of the evidence, but also the degree of certainty and uncertainty associated to the evidence, will be the subject of partisan interests. Sensitivity auditing is recommended in the European Commission guidelines for impact assessment, as well as in the report Science Advice for Policy by European Academies.

==Pitfalls and difficulties==
Some common difficulties in sensitivity analysis include:

* Assumptions vs. inferences: In uncertainty and sensitivity analysis there is a crucial trade off between how scrupulous an analyst is in exploring the input assumptions and how wide the resulting inference may be. The point is well illustrated by the econometrician Edward E. Leamer:
 &quot; I have proposed a form of organized sensitivity analysis that I call &#x27;global sensitivity analysis&#x27; in which a neighborhood of alternative assumptions is selected and the corresponding interval of inferences is identified. Conclusions are judged to be sturdy only if the neighborhood of assumptions is wide enough to be credible and the corresponding interval of inferences is narrow enough to be useful.&quot;

: Note Leamer&#x27;s emphasis is on the need for &#x27;credibility&#x27; in the selection of assumptions. The easiest way to invalidate a model is to demonstrate that it is fragile with respect to the uncertainty in the assumptions or to show that its assumptions have not been taken &#x27;wide enough&#x27;. The same concept is expressed by Jerome R. Ravetz, for whom bad modeling is when &quot;uncertainties in inputs must be suppressed lest outputs become indeterminate.&quot;
* Not enough information to build probability distributions for the inputs: Probability distributions can be constructed from expert elicitation, although even then it may be hard to build distributions with great confidence. The subjectivity of the probability distributions or ranges will strongly affect the sensitivity analysis.
* Unclear purpose of the analysis: Different statistical tests and measures are applied to the problem and different factors rankings are obtained. The test should instead be tailored to the purpose of the analysis, e.g. one uses Monte Carlo filtering if one is interested in which factors are most responsible for generating high/low values of the output.
* Too many model outputs are considered: This may be acceptable for the quality assurance of sub-models but should be avoided when presenting the results of the overall analysis.
* Piecewise sensitivity: This is when one performs sensitivity analysis on one sub-model at a time. This approach is non conservative as it might overlook interactions among factors in different sub-models (Type II error).

==SA in international context==
The importance of understanding and managing uncertainty in model results has inspired many scientists from different research centers all over the world to take a close interest in this subject. National and international agencies involved in impact assessment studies have included sections devoted to sensitivity analysis in their guidelines. Examples are the European Commission (see e.g. the guidelines for impact assessment), the White House Office of Management and Budget, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and US Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s modeling guidelines.

<text>Loch Fyne (, ; meaning &quot;Loch of the Vine/Wine&quot;), is a sea loch off the Firth of Clyde and forms part of the coast of the Cowal Peninsula. Located on the west coast of Argyll and Bute, west of Scotland. It extends inland from the Sound of Bute, making it the longest of the sea lochs in Scotland. It is connected to the Sound of Jura by the Crinan Canal. Although there is no evidence that grapes have grown there, the title is probably honorific, indicating that the river, (river Fyne), was a well-respected river.

In the north the terrain is mountainous, with the Arrochar Alps, , Glen Shira, Glen Fyne, Glen Croe, Arrochar, Tyndrum and Loch Lomond nearby.

It is overlooked by the Tinkers&#x27; Heart, an old travellers&#x27; monument. It was a place for weddings to traditionally take place.

==Transport==

===Roads===

The loch has several roads surrounding it. The A83 goes round the head of the loch then travels down the west coast of Loch Fyne, from Ardrishaig to Tarbert along the Knapdale coast. Leaving the A83 north of Cairndow the A815 travels down the east shore of Loch Fyne along the Cowal Peninsula coast to Strachur, where to continue down the east shore the A886 leads to Newton. Where you turn off onto the B8000 which carries on down the east shore to Millhouse, where you can go to Portavadie or Kames (direct) or via the Ardlamont Peninsula, a longer route to Kames.

===Ferries===
At the mouth of Loch Fyne between Portavadie on the Cowal Peninsula, on the east shore of the loch. A vehicle ferry traverses the loch to Tarbert on the Kintyre Peninsula on the west shore.

===Crinan Canal===


The Crinan Canal connects Loch Fyne at Ardrishaig and the Sound of Jura at the hamlet of Crinan itself, giving a shortcut for smaller vessels out to the Hebrides saving the longer route of going around the Kintyre Peninsula. The canal was built between 1794 and 1801 when the canal was opened, under the supervision of John Rennie. In 1816 Thomas Telford redesigned parts of the canal to remedy technical issues with water supplies for the canal. There are fifteen locks along the canal&#x27;s length.

==History==

===World War II===

During the Second World War, HMS Quebec (a shore establishment) also known as the &quot;No 1&quot; Combined Operations Training Centre (CTC) was centred a few miles south of Inveraray and used the shores of the Loch Fyne and surrounding coastline. It trained personnel in the techniques involved in the use of landing craft and the setting up of a beachhead. The No1 CTC was manned and trained personnel from all three services, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and the Army, troops of the allies were also trained. This important military facility was set up in October 1940, around 250,000 personnel passed through the training centre by 1944. The main site is now occupied by Argyll Caravan Park.

==Nature and conservation==

Dolphins, seals and otters inhabit the loch, and basking sharks can appear in its waters during the summer months. A Ross&#x27;s gull was present at the loch in early 2007.

In 2014 Loch Fyne was declared a Nature Conservation Marine Protected Area (NCMPA). The designation covers the entire loch northwards from a point near Otter Ferry.

==Fisheries==

Loch Fyne has a reputation for its oyster fishery, and as a consequence, the loch has given its name to the once locally owned Loch Fyne Oysters and to the associated Loch Fyne Restaurants. It is also notable for its herring-fishing industry, and hence the famous Loch Fyne Kipper, originally caught using the drift-net method. In the mid-19th century, Loch Fyne was the centre of the battle between the traditional drift-net fishermen and the new trawl-net fishermen who sprang up around Tarbert and Campbeltown in 1833.

Several Scottish sea-fishing records have been set in the loch:

==Sport and leisure==

===Diving===

Loch Fyne is a popular area for sport diving. Off the coast at St Catherines, is a boulder field and a wrecked speedboat. At Kenmore Point is Stallion Rock, a single rock that rises from the sea bed.

===Sight seeing===

====Castles====

It is also a popular tourist destination with attractions such as Inveraray Castle, Dunderave Castle, Kilmory Castle, Minard Castle and the nearby ruins of Castle MacEwen and Old Castle Lachlan around the shores of Loch Fyne.

====Crarae Garden====

Crarae Garden located 10 miles south of Inveraray, the National Trust for Scotland gardens overlook Loch Fyne.

==== Inveraray Bell Tower ====
The Loch is overlooked by the 126 feet (38 m) high Inverary Bell Tower, visible from much of the Loch, and is a popular tourist attraction.

<text>Martin Ziguélé (born 12 February 1957) is a Central African politician who was Prime Minister of the Central African Republic from 2001 to 2003. He placed second in the 2005 presidential election and is currently the President of the Movement for the Liberation of the Central African People (MLPC).

== Early life and education ==
Ziguélé was born on 12 February 1957. His father worked as a soldier. He finished his primary education in Paoua in 1968. Afterward, he continued his education at Petit séminaire in Bossangoa and graduated in 1972. He then enrolled in Lycée des Rapides in Bangui and graduated in 1975. Subsequently, he studied at Institut international des assurances in Yaounde from 1976 to 1978. He also studied English literature at the University of Bangui and finished it in 1982.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Ziguélé began his career working at the Insurance Control Department of the Ministry of Finance in 1978. Afterward, he worked on various position at Entreprise d’état d’assurances et de réassurances (SIRIRI) in Bangui from 1988 to 1995. He then moved to Lomé to work at Compagnie commune de réassurance des états membres de la conférence internationale de contrôle d’assurance (CICA-RE) as head of division for non-African affairs for five years. In 2000, he returned to Bangui and became the director of the BEAC Bangui Branch. 

=== Political career ===
In 1979, Ziguélé started his political career by joining MLPC. 

Ziguélé was appointed as Prime Minister on 1 April 2001 by President Ange-Félix Patassé, replacing Anicet-Georges Dologuélé. He had previously lived in Lomé, Togo for twenty years and was an executive member of the MLPC. He also hold the portfolio of Minister of Finance. Ziguélé left office when rebel leader François Bozizé took power upon capturing the capital, Bangui, on 15 March 2003. Ziguélé was allowed to go into exile in France.

Ziguélé was initially barred from running in the 2005 presidential election, along with six other candidates, by a court ruling on December 30, 2004. He was subsequently reinstated as a candidate by Bozizé, along with two other candidates, on January 4. Later in January, all barred candidates, with the lone exception of Patassé, were allowed to run; following this, Patassé&#x27;s party, the MLPC, backed Ziguélé for the election. Previously, he had been running as an independent. The election was held on March 13, 2005, and Ziguélé placed second with 23.5% of the votes according to official results. He faced Bozizé in a second round of voting, and tried to distance himself from Patassé in campaigning, but was defeated and took 35.4% of the vote.

Ziguélé was elected as President of the MLPC on a provisional basis for one year at an extraordinary party congress in late June 2006, while Patassé was suspended from the party. On June 23, 2007, at the end of the MLPC&#x27;s third ordinary congress, Ziguélé was elected to a three-year term as President.

In the December 2015 presidential election, Ziguélé stood as the MLPC candidate and placed fourth. In the February–March 2016 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as the MLPC candidate in the third constituency of Bocaranga, winning in the first round with 66.25%% of the vote.

In October 2021, The COD-2020 coalition, Crépin Mboli-Goumba’s Patrie party and Martin Ziguélé’s Central African People’s Liberation Movement withdrew their representatives from the organizing committee and denounced “a desire to sabotage the Dialogue”.

<doc id="620091" wikidata="Q2653611" url="?curid=620091" title="Penmaenmawr">
<text>Penmaenmawr (, ) is a town and community in Conwy County Borough, Wales, which was formerly in the parish of Dwygyfylchi and the traditional county of Caernarfonshire. It is on the North Wales coast between Conwy and Llanfairfechan and was an important quarrying town, though quarrying is no longer a major employer. The population of the community was 4,353 in 2011, including Dwygyfylchi and Capelulo. The town itself having a population of 2,868 (2011).

It was named after Penmaenmawr mountain, which stands above the sea immediately west of the town. Much of its formerly rounded top (with an old hill-fort) has been quarried away, leaving the present-day lower flat top.

The town was bypassed by the A55 Expressway in the 1980s, losing its old Edwardian period promenade in the process, which was largely replaced by a modern one. Penmaenmawr is noted for its spectacular mountain and coastal walks. Nearby are the popular attractions of Sychnant Pass and Mynydd y Dref, and the town also lies partly within Snowdonia National Park (Eryri).

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Penmaenmawr&quot; is the Welsh for &quot;Head of the Great Stone&quot;, or &quot;Great Headland of Stone&quot; contrasting with Penmaenbach; &quot;Pen&quot; meaning &quot;head&quot;, &quot;maen&quot; meaning &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;mawr&quot; meaning &quot;large&quot;.

== Geography ==
The villages that make up Penmaenmawr are Penmaenan and Pant Yr Afon on the west and Dwygyfylchi and Capelulo on the east. They are on a small coastal plain about long and half a mile deep facing Conwy Bay and the Irish Sea to the north. The bay is sheltered by the south-east tip of Anglesey and Puffin Island to the north-west and the limestone headland of Pen-y-Gogarth (the Great Orme) to the north-east. The sea is shallow here between Traeth Lafan and the Conwy estuary. The beach is extensive, consisting of smooth pebbles and a wide expanse of sand; it was awarded a Blue Flag for five years running.

Two headlands separate Penmaenmawr from its neighbours. In the west, the bulk of Penmaen Mawr lies between the town neighbouring Llanfairfechan and the wider coastal plain extending to Bangor. To the east, the smaller but no less rugged headland of Penmaen Bach divides Dwygyfylchi from Conwy Morfa.

Penmaenbach is the most northerly tip of the Snowdonia National Park, which covers a large part of Dwygyfylchi and Capelulo. To the south an arc of hills and uplands extends east to west from Capelulo to Penmaen Mawr, beginning with Yr Allt Wen above Dwygyfylchi, Sychnant Pass (the old road crosses this pass to Conwy) and Pen-sychnant at Capelulo. The rounded hill of Foel Lys, Gwddw Glas (Green Gorge), Bryn Derwydd and the head of Cwm Graiglwyd and finally Penmaenmawr. Foel Lus rises to .

The coastal plain is nearly divided by Trwyn-yr-Wylfa, which also marks the boundary between Pant-yr-afon and Penmaenan in the west and the Hen Bentra or &quot;Old Village&quot; of Dwygyfylchi and Capelulo in the east. Two small rivers flow through the area. The first, Afon Pabwyr, runs down from wooded Cwm Graiglwyd then under the town centre, Pant-yr-afon, to the beach; the second and larger, Afon Gyrrach, runs for about from the northern slopes of Tal-y-Fan to the sea near Penmaenbach, passing through Nant Ddaear-y-llwynog (The Fairy Glen) and the old villages of Dwygyfylchi and Capelulo.

== History == 

=== Prehistory ===
The uplands above the town have many prehistoric remains, including the site of prehistoric polished stone axe factories on the west slopes of Cwm Graiglwyd near the top of Penmaen-mawr. This was once one of the most important stone axe manufacturing sites in Europe, together with the Langdale axe industry in the Lake District, Tievebulliagh in County Antrim and other sites across Britain.

There is evidence that axes from Graiglwyd were exported widely 5,000 years ago, examples having been found as far afield as Cornwall and south-east England. The nearby Meini Hirion, known in English as Druid&#x27;s Circle, is a prehistoric stone circle. Archaeological excavations have discovered the cremated remains of children at the site. A prehistoric trackway from Bwlch-y-ddeufaen to Conwy runs by the circle. The summit of Penmaen-mawr, from which the town takes its name, was above sea level until reduced by modern quarrying. The summit area was crowned by Braich-y-Dinas, one of the largest Iron Age hillforts in Europe, comparable with Tre&#x27;r Ceiri near Trefor on the Llŷn peninsula. However, nothing remains today; the last remnants were obliterated by quarrying in the 1920s.

=== Medieval and early modern periods ===
According to tradition, the 5th or 6th century saint Seiriol, after whom Ynys Seiriol, the Welsh name for Puffin Island or Priestholme, is named, had a hermit&#x27;s cell in Cwm Graiglwyd. A declivity, Clipyn Seiriol, above the modern road tunnel through Penmaenmawr, also bears his name, as does the modern church of St Seiriol&#x27;s near the town centre. The older church of St Gwynin&#x27;s in Dwygyfylchi is the parish church today. Penmaenmawr is also associated with Saint Ulo, Capelulo being at the foot of Sychnant and reputedly the site of an early medieval chapel.

From the early Middle Ages onwards the parish has been part of Arllechwedd Uchaf, and this ancient Welsh &quot;cwmwd&quot; (English: commote), which together with neighbouring Arllechwedd Isaf makes up the &quot;cantref&quot; (hundred) of Arllechwedd, is still used by the church as an administrative unit today.

=== Quarrying town and seaside resort ===

The industrial quarrying of igneous rock (diorite) at Penmaenan began in 1830 with the opening of the Penmaen Quarry and the subsequent, competing Graiglwyd and &quot;Old&quot; quarries which were amalgamated by 1888 under Colonel Darbishire. Most of the production in these early years was of setts and paving, but from 1881 the advantage of crushed rock for railway ballast was demonstrated and new crushing mills were built to provide for that market. In 1911 Darbishire merged these operations with the quarries of Trefor to form the Penmaenmawr &amp; Welsh Granite Co. As the industry grew, workers and their families flocked to Penmaenmawr from all over north-west Wales and beyond. The link was especially strong with Trefor, the home of Trefor granite quarry on the slopes of Yr Eifl. The community which sprang up in the present-day wards of Penmaenan and Pant-yr-afon was close-knit and almost entirely Welsh-speaking. By the early years of the 20th century about 1,000 men worked in the quarry and its associated workshops. Neighbouring Llanfairfechan was an integral part of this process.

The quarried stone was lowered by self-acting inclines to the gauge tramway which ran to jetties from where the setts were loaded into ships. After 1848 the majority of the quarry output was sent by main-line rail, although the quarry and its internal narrow gauge railway continued to operate through the 19th century.

Life was not easy for the quarrymen, especially those who worked on the higher slopes. They were expected to walk up to the summit area in all weathers and faced losing pay if unable to reach the top. A strong spirit of camaraderie developed and was reflected in the town&#x27;s chapels, pubs and cultural societies. Products were exported by rail to ports such as Liverpool and the cities of England and by sea from the two quarrying jetties to Liverpool and also to a number of European ports such as Hamburg. Ships continued to load cargoes from the Darbishire jetty until 1976, although sea trade had been sparse since the famous stranding of the &quot;Rethi Muller&quot; in 1967. Railway ballast continued to move in quantity from the sidings near the station, but all the original infrastructure was swept away by the building of the new A55 Expressway in the late 1980s. A new rail-loading facility was constructed and the original sidings space used for the new road. In 2008 the contract for the supply of railway ballast to Network Rail was lost, and since that time there have only been limited movements by rail – such as for construction of the Manchester Metrolink extensions. This quarrying over time removed the whole top of Penmaenmawr mountain, which was once much higher with a rounded top, with an old hill-fort.

The town grew in popularity as a seaside resort for the well-to-do in the second half of the 19th century, in part due to the enthusiasm shown by statesman and Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone who holidayed eleven times in Penmaenmawr between 1855 and 1896.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Penmaenmawr, at community (town) level and principal area (county borough) level: Penmaenmawr Town Council (Cyngor Tref Penmaenmawr) and Conwy County Borough Council. The town council is based at the Community Centre on Conwy Road.

===Administrative history===
Penmaenmawr formed part of the ancient parish of Dwygyfylchi within the historic county of Caernarfonshire. In 1866 the parish was made a local government district, administered by an elected local board. In 1890, the district&#x27;s name was changed from Dwygyfylchi to Penmaenmawr.

Such local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Penmaenmawr Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area becoming a community in the Aberconwy borough of the new county of Gwynedd. Further reforms in 1996 abolished the boroughs and counties created in 1974, and Penmaenmawr was placed in the new Conwy County Borough. For the ceremonial purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty, Penmaenmawr remained in the preserved county of Gwynedd until 2003, when the whole of Conwy County Borough was placed in the preserved county of Clwyd.

== Notable events ==
On 27 August 1950 the 1:45 am up-express passenger train from Holyhead to Euston, the Irish Mail, was approaching Penmaenmawr station at 60–70 mph after passing a distant signal set to &quot;clear&quot;. As the train approached the home signal it was suddenly set to &quot;danger&quot;. The driver shut off steam and applied the brake but was not able to prevent a collision at 45–50 mph with a light engine on the up line. Four passengers and a sleeping car attendant were killed outright and a fifth passenger died in hospital.

On 24 September 1976, Penmaenmawr was the scene of a mass murder, as former submarine commander Neil Rutherford killed four people at the Red Gables hotel, then set the hotel on fire and shot himself.

<doc id="620093" wikidata="Q988925" url="?curid=620093" title="Ellen Ripley">
<text>Lt. Ellen Louise Ripley, usually referred to by her surname, is a fictional character and the original protagonist of the &quot;Alien&quot; film series, played by American actress Sigourney Weaver. Considered one of the greatest characters in science fiction film history, the character earned Weaver worldwide recognition, and remains her most famous role to date. Although she was originally conceived as male for the first &quot;Alien&quot; film, director Ridley Scott decided early in production to make her a woman.

&quot;Alien&quot; (1979) and its sequel &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986) were heralded for challenging gender roles, particularly in the science fiction, action, and horror genres. Weaver&#x27;s performances are also highly praised: for &quot;Aliens&quot;, she earned her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, which is now seen as a landmark since the Academy, to that point, had given little recognition to the genres of science-fiction and horror. For her role in the franchise, Weaver has also been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Drama, a BAFTA Award for Best Leading Newcomer, and four Saturn Awards for Best Actress, winning one for &quot;Aliens&quot;.

Ripley is often considered one of the most significant female protagonists in cinematic history, and is a prominent figure in popular culture. Today, Ripley&#x27;s influence extends beyond that of the original film franchise; she has appeared in novels, comic books and video games.

==Biography==
===Films===
====In &quot;Alien&quot; (1979)====

Ripley is introduced as a warrant officer aboard the &quot;Nostromo&quot;, a spaceship en route to Earth from Thedus. Having been placed in stasis for the long journey home, the crew is awakened when the &quot;Nostromo &quot;receives a transmission of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid. Following their landing, an unknown creature infiltrates the ship, and kills every other member of the crew. Ripley is the only member to escape from the &quot;Nostromo&quot; prior to its explosion, which she deliberately started to kill the monster. However, she discovers that the Alien is also aboard the ship&#x27;s shuttle, but expels it into space before putting herself in stasis for the return trip to Earth.

====In &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986)====

57 years later, Ripley awakes from her stasis. Her testimony regarding the Alien is met with extreme skepticism; she loses her space flight license as a result of her &quot;questionable judgment,&quot; and finds out that her daughter, Amanda, has died of old age. However, after contact is lost with a colony on LV-426 (the planet where her crew first encountered the Alien eggs), Ripley accompanies a group of Colonial Marines to investigate. They find the planet infested by many Aliens, who wipe out almost all of the marines. Ripley finally escapes the planet with Corporal Dwayne Hicks, the android Bishop, and Newt, a young girl who is the last surviving colonist. Back on the &quot;Sulaco&quot;, they are soon attacked by the surviving Alien Queen, which is finally expelled into space by Ripley. Ripley enters hypersleep alongside the three other survivors for the return to Earth.

====In &quot;Alien 3&quot; (1992)====

The &quot;Sulaco&quot; launches an escape pod containing the four survivors, which then crashes on Fiorina &#x27;Fury&#x27; 161, an abandoned foundry facility and penal colony. Ripley alone survives the crash. Unbeknownst to her, an Alien egg had been aboard the ship. Once hatched in the prison, the creature begins to kill inmates and guards, but strangely refuses to kill her. After rallying the inmates and preparing the defense against the creature, Ripley discovers the embryo of an Alien Queen growing inside her, thus realizing why she had not been attacked. After having killed the Alien by thermal shock, Ripley sacrifices herself by diving into a gigantic furnace just as the alien Queen begins to erupt from her chest. Her plan was to exterminate the final trace of the Aliens and prevent the Weyland-Yutani Corporation from using it as a biological weapon.

====In &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997)====

200 years after her death, scientists clone Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and surgically retrieve the Alien Queen embryo from her body. The United Systems Military hopes to breed Aliens to study on the spaceship USM &quot;Auriga&quot;, using kidnapped hosts delivered to them by a group of mercenaries. The Aliens escape their enclosures, while Ripley and the mercenaries attempt to flee to the &quot;Betty&quot;. They must destroy the &quot;Auriga&quot;, lest it make its emergency landing and unleashes Xenomorphs on Earth. Ripley is taken to the Alien nest, where the Queen gives birth to a Newborn, a Xenomorph with human traits. The hybrid Alien recognizes Ripley as its mother and kills the Queen. Ripley escapes to the &quot;Betty&quot;, where she tearfully kills the Newborn when it is discovered aboard attacking the other survivors. The &quot;Auriga&quot; crashes into Earth, destroying all the remaining Xenomorphs in a massive explosion. From the windows of the &quot;Betty,&quot; Call and Ripley look down at Earth, and when Call asks what Ripley wants to do next, she says, &quot;I&#x27;m a stranger here myself.&quot; In an alternate ending, the &quot;Betty&quot; lands in a ruined Paris.

====In &quot;The Predator&quot; (2018)====

After director Neill Blomkamp announced on February 19, 2015 that his next film would be a fifth &quot;Alien&quot; movie, Weaver confirmed on February 25 that she would reprise her role as Ripley in the film. On January 21, 2017, in response to a fan question on Twitter asking what the chances were of his Alien project actually happening, Blomkamp responded &quot;slim.&quot; In April, Scott said he did not think the film would ever be made. He elaborated that there was never a complete script, just a 10-page pitch, that Fox decided they did not want to pursue any further. Commentators have noted this goes against Weaver&#x27;s and James Cameron&#x27;s statements about reading Blomkamp&#x27;s script for the film, although it is possible Weaver and Cameron were referring to the pitch document. On May 1, 2017, Ridley Scott confirmed that the fifth film is not happening. An alternate ending for &quot;The Predator&quot; displaying a Weyland-Yutani Corp pod containing Ripley (played by Breanna Watkins) wearing a Weyland-Yutani breathing apparatus shaped like an Alien Facehugger was yet one among several references intended to further connect the &quot;Predator&quot; films to the &quot;Alien&quot; films.

===Video games===
====In &quot;Aliens: Colonial Marines&quot; (2013)====

Ripley has two cameos in the &quot;Stasis Interrupted&quot; DLC for the game. In this prequel campaign, Ripley is seen being impregnated by a facehugger and also appeared recreating the same final scene of &quot;Alien 3.&quot; The game also revealed that Hicks actually survived the events of &quot;Alien 3&quot; as he was retrieved by another Colonial Marines team, with the body in the stasis chamber that crashed being another marine who was knocked into Hicks&#x27; pod during a firefight, dying when the EEV crashed. Ripley, Newt and Bishop&#x27;s pods were ejected while Hicks had to go with the other Marines.

====In &quot;Alien: Isolation&quot; (2014)====
In 2014, Weaver reprised her role as Ripley for the first time in 17 years for a voice cameo in the video game &quot;&quot;, centered on Ripley&#x27;s daughter Amanda, and more extensively in its two DLCs set during the events of &quot;Alien&quot;. This game, set 15 years after the events of &quot;Alien&quot; and 42 years before the events of &quot;Aliens&quot;, features Ripley&#x27;s daughter Amanda. Amanda was originally introduced in the extended version of &quot;Aliens&quot;, when Ripley learns that during her 57-years long stasis, Amanda grew up, married, and died. In the game, Amanda investigates potential clues regarding her mother&#x27;s disappearance, and goes to the space station &quot;Sevastopol&quot; in hope to find answers. Near the end of the game, Amanda ultimately finds a vocal message from her mother (voiced by Weaver), who added a personal message to the &quot;Nostromo&quot; final log entry at the end of &quot;Alien&quot; addressed to Amanda, in which Ripley explains the true nature of the disappearance of the &quot;Nostromo&quot;, tells her she loves her, and hopes that she will get to hear this someday.

Weaver also reprises her role more extensively alongside several other original cast members in the game&#x27;s two DLCs, set during the events of &quot;Alien&quot;. Ripley is joined by Dallas (Tom Skerritt), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Parker (Yaphet Kotto) and Ash (Ian Holm, likeness only), allowing the player to play through two iconic scenes from the film. With the Nostromo Edition pre-order, the &quot;Crew Expendable&quot; bonus content allows gamers to play as one of the surviving crew members just after Brett&#x27;s demise to entice the Alien to the ship&#x27;s airlock. In the &quot;Last Survivor&quot;, Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence before escaping on the &quot;Narcissus&quot;.

===Biography of Ripley 8===
====In &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997)====

Two hundred years after Ripley&#x27;s death, a clone of Ripley is successfully produced aboard the spaceship &quot;Auriga&quot;. Her DNA proved difficult to separate from that of the alien that was inside her during the events of &quot;Alien 3&quot;, so the first six clones were useless monstrosities. The seventh clone turned out human enough to warrant an attempt at retrieving the alien inside her, but this also ended in failure. The eighth clone proves successful, and becomes the central character of a new story. However, the separation was still not perfect. Number 8 has enhanced strength and reflexes, acidic blood, and an empathic link with the Aliens, and the aliens have slightly more human traits, including a browner skin coloration and changes to their reproductive cycle. Number Eight learns to talk and interact with humans, but soon Aliens escape their confinement and kill most of the crew. She escapes from her cell and later meets and joins a group of mercenaries; developing a close relationship with their youngest member, Annalee Call. The now fully-grown Alien Queen, having developed a womb because of Ripley&#x27;s DNA, gives birth to a human-Alien hybrid, who kills the Queen and imprints on Number Eight as its mother. After escaping the &quot;Auriga&quot; in the &quot;Betty&quot;, Ripley kills the newborn Alien by using her own acidic blood to burn a hole through a viewing pane, causing the creature to be sucked violently through the small hole and into the vacuum of space, saving Call. In a scene included in the extended edition of the film (referenced in the events of &quot;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&quot;), the &quot;Betty&quot; lands on Earth and Ripley and Call discover that Paris is desolate.

====In &quot;Aliens vs. Predator vs. The Terminator&quot; (2000)====

The comic book &quot;Aliens versus Predator versus The Terminator&quot; continues the storyline of Ripley 8 after &quot;Resurrection&quot;, seeing Ripley 8 allying with the Predators to defeat both a new wave of Aliens and a group of Terminators created by a long-dormant Skynet program to reinvent itself if it was destroyed, culminating in Ripley 8 apparently sacrificing herself to destroy the original super-soldier/Terminator.

====In &quot;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&quot; (2014)====
At the beginning of &quot;Alien: Sea of Sorrows&quot;, set 200 years after the events of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, it is revealed that the crashing of the &quot;Auriga&quot; at the end of &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; caused the destruction in Paris seen at the end of that film. Additionally, the protagonist of the novel, Decker, is stated to be a descendant of Ellen Ripley, but there are several hints throughout the novel revealing that Decker&#x27;s grandmother was actually Ripley 8 (mainly his empathic abilities, the fact Amanda Ripley-McClaren is stated to have had no children in &quot;Aliens&quot;, and when Decker is shown a picture of Ripley, he says that she is not the person he sees in his head).

===Spin-off media===
Ripley&#x27;s life and career have been extensively expanded on in various spin-off comics and novels, many of which were written before her death on Fiorina 161, providing instead a chronology continuing on from the end of &quot;Aliens&quot;. In the Dark Horse novel series, Ripley appears at the end of Book 3, &quot;&quot;; but subsequent books, in order to bring the book continuity in line with the film continuity, reveal that she is actually an android created in Ripley&#x27;s likeness and given false memories. All novels were rebooted in 2012, meaning the only canonical books featuring Ripley are &quot;&quot; (by Tim Lebbon), &quot;Sea of Sorrows&quot; (by James A. Moore) and &quot;River of Pain&quot;. In &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;, Ripley is woken from stasis 37 years after the events of &quot;Alien&quot;, fights Xenomorphs alongside several miners, and is put in stasis again the end of the book with her memory of these events erased to spare her from the worst of the psychological trauma she has experienced. Ripley is mentioned repeatedly in &quot;Sea of Sorrows&quot;, which stars the grandson of Ripley 8, and appears in &quot;River of Pain&quot;, which takes place before and during the events of &quot;Aliens&quot;. An Audio-Animatronic Ripley was featured in the &quot;Alien&quot; scene of The Great Movie Ride at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at Walt Disney World from 1989 to 2017.

===Awards and impact for Sigourney Weaver===
For her performance in &quot;Alien&quot;, Weaver was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles and a Saturn Award for Best Actress. Although her performance had already been acclaimed in the first film, &quot;Aliens&quot; gave worldwide recognition to Weaver: she was the third horror actress in history (after Ellen Burstyn for &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and Sissy Spacek for &quot;Carrie&quot;) to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. She also received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama, and won the Saturn Award for Best Actress, the first award in her career (except a minor award, the Mystfest Award for Best Actress, won for &quot;Half Moon Street&quot;).

Weaver was also co-producer of the third and fourth films of the franchise. Although they were less successful critically, Weaver&#x27;s performance was praised: she received her third and fourth Saturn Award for Best Actress nominations for both films and a nomination for a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Actress – Sci-Fi for &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;. Although she didn&#x27;t win awards specifically for &quot;Alien 3&quot; and &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, she won the Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year Award for her acting work during the 1997 film year, including &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot;, &quot;The Ice Storm&quot; and &quot;Snow White: A Tale of Terror&quot;.

Weaver won a DVDX Award for Best Audio Commentary (New for DVD) for her audio participation, among numerous other members of the crew, in the audio commentary of &quot;Alien&quot; in its 2003-reissue in &quot;Alien Quadrilogy&quot;.

<text>Colwyn Bay () is a town, community and seaside resort in Conwy County Borough on the north coast of Wales overlooking the Irish Sea. It lies within the historic county of Denbighshire. Eight neighbouring communities are incorporated within its postal district. Established as its own separate parish in 1844 with just a small grouping of homes and farms where the community of Old Colwyn stands today, Colwyn Bay has expanded to become the second-largest community and business centre in the north of Wales as well as the 14th largest in the whole of Wales with the urban statistical area, including Old Colwyn, Rhos-on-Sea, and Mochdre and Penrhyn Bay, having a population of 34,284 at the 2011 census.

== History ==

The western side of Colwyn Bay, Rhos-on-Sea, includes a number of historic sites associated with St Trillo and Ednyfed Fychan, the 13th century general and councillor to Llywelyn the Great.

The name &#x27;Colwyn&#x27; may be named after Collwyn ap Tangno, an 11th century nobleman who was Lord of Eifionnydd, Ardudwy and part of the Llŷn peninsula, or after the River Colwyn in Old Colwyn. (In Welsh the word &quot;Colwyn&quot; means &quot;puppy&quot; (with the &#x27;w&#x27; being a vowel), but &quot;Collwyn&quot; (with an alveolar lateral fricative) is a more plausible toponym, meaning &quot;hazel grove&quot; (&quot;llwyn cyll&quot;).)

King Richard II (1367–1400) was ambushed in Old Colwyn in 1399 by supporters of Henry Bolingbroke as he returned to England from Ireland.

During World War II the Colwyn Bay Hotel, Marine Road (now demolished) was the headquarters of the Ministry of Food. This also housed the Cocoa &amp; Chocolate division and was the communications hub for the ministry. They continued to use the hotel until 1953. Colwyn also supported the war effort by becoming a significant location for the diamond cutting and polishing industry, which was used to help fund the war effort.

The nucleus of the town comprised Old Colwyn (originally Colwyn) and Llysfaen to the east and Llandrillo-yn-Rhos to the west; the town grew up between those two places (which are part of Colwyn Bay for local government purposes). As in the cases of Llandudno and Rhyl, Colwyn Bay grew rapidly in the second half of the 19th century following the arrival of the railway in 1848, and in the early 20th century as a seaside holiday town conveniently for the large towns in NW England.

The town was in the historic county of Denbighshire until 1974, and then in Clwyd until 1996.

== Government ==

Bay of Colwyn Town Council is a statutory body, covering the communities in the urban area. It is based at the old police station and magistrates court, now known as Colwyn Bay Town Hall. The mayor for 2019 to 2020 was Councillor Neil Bastow. Conwy County Borough Council was based at the old civic centre in Colwyn Bay before moving to Coed Pella in Conway Road in Colwyn Bay in November 2018.

== Geography ==
The town is situated about halfway along the north coast of Wales, between the sea and the Pwllycrochan Woods on the towering hillside. Groes yn Eirias (Welsh:&quot;Cross in Torch&quot;) was once a separate hamlet centred on the Glyn farmhouse (c1640) but the area is now occupied by the Glyn estate and Eirias Park.

== Climate ==
Like the rest of the British Isles, Colwyn Bay experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters, and often high winds. The local climate is well known for the prevalence of Foehn winds: winds from the south which pass over the nearby mountains and warm and dry on their descent, leading to far higher temperatures than might otherwise be expected; the area held the Welsh high temperature record for February at 18.7 °C from 23 February 2012 to 24 February 2019.

== Demography ==
Prior to local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974 Colwyn Bay was a municipal borough with a population of around 25,000, but in 1974 this designation disappeared leaving five separate parishes, known as communities in Wales, of which the one bearing the name Colwyn Bay encompassed just the central part of the overall town and in the 2001 Census contained just 9,742 people, with the others as follows: Mochdre (1,862), Rhos-on-Sea (7,110), Glan Conwy (2,290), Old Colwyn (7,626) and Llysfaen (2,652). This gives a total figure for the six communities of 31,382, generally referred to as the population of Colwyn Bay, making it the 16th largest urban area in Wales and the second largest settlement in North Wales. Bringing 2011 figures into account that figure is now 33,549. The area is sometimes referred to by the name Bay of Colwyn.

According to the 2011 Census, 17.9% of the population aged three and above noted that they could speak Welsh. The Census also noted that 29.9% of the population who were born in Wales could speak Welsh.

== Economy ==
The town is dominated by the tourist trade, because of its famous beaches. Colwyn Bay is a Fairtrade Town as certified by the Fairtrade Foundation as part of the Fairtrade Towns scheme.

== Culture ==
Colwyn Bay hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1910 and 1947. Also the Victoria Pier hosted many dances and shows during the 20th century and became popular with touring bands and artistes through the 1960s until the final gig there in August 2008.

== Community facilities ==
The town has parks and gardens and a number of natural amenities such as Eirias Park. Colwyn Bay has received a gold award 8 times in the Wales in Bloom competition. In 2009 and 2010 the town has been invited to enter Britain in Bloom and has been awarded silver gilt in both years. The Welsh Mountain Zoo is nearby.

The Porth Eirias Watersports Centre offers tuition in sailing, windsurfing and power boating as well as kayak and canoe hire. In 2013 it was nominated for &quot;Building Design&quot;&#x27;s Carbuncle Cup.

== Landmarks ==
The Victoria Pier was closed to the public in 2009, when a dispute between Conwy County Borough Council and the pier&#x27;s owner led to him being declared bankrupt. The fate of the pier was initially uncertain; the council hoped it would be &quot;substantially&quot; demolished for &quot;health and safety and visual reasons to be able to re-open that section of the beach”. 
In January 2017, the lower end of the pier partially collapsed into the sea and Conwy Council subsequently announced plans to dismantle and store the pier, with a view of restoring it at a later date. The pier was finally demolished in May 2018.

Llety&#x27;r Dryw is a Grade II listed house in Abergele Road, built for the uncle of Anthony Eden and now used as the training centre for North Wales Police. Llys Euryn is a medieval manor house on Bryn Euryn, now in ruins. There are a number of buildings by notable local architect Sidney Colwyn Foulkes. These include Williams Deacon&#x27;s Bank 1925 and Colwyn House 1933-7 originally occupied by the W.S.Wood department store. Colwyn Bay Community Hospital was completed in 1925.

&quot;Cotswold&quot;, on Brackley Avenue, is a notable town villa by Alfred Steinthal. Built for a Manchester businesswoman, the house was subsequently the home of Sidney Colwyn Foulkes. It is a Grade II listed building. Its Japanese and Arts and Crafts style gardens are listed, also at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales. Another notable garden is The Flagstaff, overlooking the bay. It was designed by Thomas Hayton Mawson for a house that was not ultimately built, and is listed at Grade II on the Cadw/ICOMOS register.

== Transport ==
The town is served by Colwyn Bay railway station located in the town centre on the North Wales Coast Line with trains run by Transport for Wales and Avanti West Coast. 
The A55 road passes through the town, running parallel to the North Wales Coast Line.

===Tramline===
The Llandudno and Colwyn Bay Electric Railway operated an electric tramway service between Llandudno and Rhos-on-Sea from 1907 and extended to Colwyn Bay in 1908. The service closed in 1956.

== Education ==
Colwyn Bay has three secondary schools - one private and two state. Eirias High School is in Eirias Park and Ysgol Bryn Elian is in Old Colwyn. Ysgol Bryn Elian mainly serves Old Colwyn and Eirias High School mainly serves Colwyn Bay, Rhos on Sea and Penrhyn Bay.

Rydal Penrhos School is a Methodist public school, which is on multiple sites in the town. Fees at this elite public school exceeded more than £34,000 per year for boarding in 2021 and boasts the only Eton Fives courts in Wales. Former alumni include Princess Maria of Romania, a cousin of Prince Charles.

The town&#x27;s primary schools are Ysgol Nant y Groes, Ysgol Pen-y-Bryn, Ysgol T Gwynn Jones, Ysgol Hen Golwyn, and Saint Joseph&#x27;s R.C. Primary and the Welsh-language Ysgol Bod Alaw.

The local cricket team is Colwyn Bay Cricket Club who play at Penrhyn Avenue and the rugby union team is Colwyn Bay RFC. As of 2012, the RGC 1404 rugby team play at Eirias Stadium in Colwyn Bay as part of a development venture by the WRU.

Colwyn Bay Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1893. The club and course closed in 1959 and the land was used for a housing development.

<doc id="620102" wikidata="Q1270178" url="?curid=620102" title="George Will">
<text>George Frederick Will (born May 4, 1941) is an American libertarian conservative writer and political commentator. He writes columns for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on a regular basis and provides commentary for &quot;NewsNation&quot;. In 1986, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called him &quot;perhaps the most powerful journalist in America&quot;. Will won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1977.

A former member of the Republican Party, Will was a close ally of Ronald Reagan during his presidential campaign in 1980. He assisted Reagan with debate preparation and was later falsely accused by former President Jimmy Carter of providing Reagan with a top secret briefing book in a scandal known as Debategate, an allegation Carter later retracted.

In later years, he became a critic of Republican politicians, including Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, and Donald Trump. Will&#x27;s disapproval of Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign led him to become an independent in 2016, and he subsequently voted for Joe Biden in 2020, and stated in September 2024 he would be voting for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

== Early life and education ==
Will was born on May 4, 1941, in Champaign, Illinois, to Louise (&quot;née&quot; Hendrickson) and Frederick L. Will. His father was a professor of philosophy, specializing in epistemology, at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Will attended University Laboratory High School of Urbana, Illinois, where he graduated in 1959.

After high school, Will attended Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, graduating in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in religion. He then went to England and attended Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree (promoted to a master&#x27;s per tradition). Will then did doctoral study in political science at Princeton University, receiving a PhD in 1968 with a dissertation entitled &quot;Beyond the Reach of Majorities: Closed Questions in the Open Society&quot;, alluding to a famous phrase from Justice Robert H. Jackson’s majority opinion in the landmark 1943 Supreme Court case &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;.

From 1970 to 1972, Will served on the staff of Republican Senator Gordon Allott of Colorado. Will then taught political philosophy at the James Madison College of Michigan State University, and at the University of Toronto. He taught at Harvard University in 1995 and again in 1998.

== Journalism career ==

Will originally had left wing political views but his views shifted toward conservatism during his studies at Oxford, especially after visiting Communist-controlled East Berlin in the mid-1960s. Will served as an editor for &quot;National Review&quot; from 1972 to 1978. He joined &quot;The Washington Post&quot; Writers Group in 1974, writing a syndicated biweekly column, which became widely circulated among newspapers across the country and continues today. his column was syndicated to about 450 newspapers. In 1976 he became a contributing editor for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, writing a biweekly backpage column until 2011.

Will won a Pulitzer Prize for Commentary for &quot;distinguished commentary on a variety of topics&quot; in 1977. Often combining factual reporting with conservative commentary, Will&#x27;s columns are known for their erudite vocabulary, allusions to political philosophers, and frequent references to baseball. Will has also written two bestselling books on the game of baseball, three books on political philosophy, and has published eleven compilations of his columns for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; and of various book reviews and lectures.

From 2013 to 2017, Will was a contributor for Fox News. Prior to joining Fox News, beginning in the early 1980s, Will was a news analyst for ABC News and was a founding member on the panel of ABC&#x27;s &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot; in 1981, now titled &quot;This Week with George Stephanopoulos&quot;. Will was a panelist on &quot;This Week&quot; until his departure from ABC News. Will was also a regular panelist on television&#x27;s &quot;Agronsky &amp; Company&quot; from 1977 through 1984. On Sunday, March 19, 2017, &quot;Meet the Press&quot; moderator Chuck Todd welcomed Will back as a panelist, stating he had been absent from the program since 1981 and that his return would mark his 52nd appearance.

On May 8, 2017, Will was announced as an MSNBC and NBC News political contributor, in which he provided regular political input on shows such as &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Morning Joe&quot;, and &quot;The 11th Hour&quot;. On December 3, 2020, Will received the National Society for Newspaper Columnists 2020 Ernie Pyle Lifetime Achievement Award, in partnership with the Society of Professional Journalists. Since January, 2022, Will has been a senior political contributor at &quot;NewsNation&quot;.

=== 1980 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign ===
Will helped Ronald Reagan prepare for his 1980 debate against Jimmy Carter. Immediately after the debate, Will—not yet a member of the ABC News staff—appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;. He was introduced by host Ted Koppel, who said: &quot;It&#x27;s my understanding that you met for some time yesterday with Governor Reagan&quot;, and that Will &quot;never made any secret of his affection&quot; for the Republican candidate. Will did not explicitly disclose that he had assisted Reagan&#x27;s debate preparation, or been present during it. He went on to praise Reagan&#x27;s &quot;thoroughbred&quot; performance, saying his &quot;game plan worked well. I don&#x27;t think he was very surprised.&quot;

In 2004 and again in 2005, Carter accused Will of giving the Reagan campaign a top-secret briefing book stolen from Carter&#x27;s office before the 1980 debate. In a 2005 syndicated column, Will called his role in Reagan&#x27;s debate preparation &quot;inappropriate&quot; but denied any role in stealing the briefing book. In response to Will&#x27;s column, Carter wrote a letter to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; retracting his accusations. Carter apologized to Will for &quot;any incorrect statement that I have ever made about his role in the use of my briefing book... I have never thought Mr. Will took my book, that the outcome of the debate was damaging to my campaign or that Mr. Will apologized to me.&quot;

=== 2009 global sea ice level ===
In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; column that expressed doubt over the effects of global warming, Will stated that: &quot;According to the University of Illinois&#x27; Arctic Climate Research Center, global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979.&quot; This and several other claims attracted the attention of environmentalists, such as British author and activist George Monbiot. Asked to respond, the website of Arctic Climate Research at the University of Illinois states that: &quot;We do not know where George Will is getting his information, but our data shows that on February 15, 1979, global sea ice area was 16.79 million sq. km and on February 15, 2009, global sea ice area was 15.45 million sq. km. Therefore, global sea ice levels are 1.34 million sq. km less in February 2009 than in February 1979.&quot; Will responded in a column that he accurately reported the Center&#x27;s information and the challenge was mistaken. This drew a second response from Monbiot, who insisted Will had not accurately reported the Center&#x27;s information. The debate continued in several forums, including a subsequent op-ed by Chris Mooney published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; challenging Will&#x27;s assertions.

=== Column regarding campus assaults ===
Will&#x27;s June 6, 2014, newspaper column about &quot;the supposed campus epidemic of rape&quot; was met with substantial criticism on Twitter, with Democratic U.S. senators and feminists also highly critical of the article. Will wrote, &quot;...when [colleges and universities] make victimhood a coveted status that confers privileges, victims proliferate.&quot; Will&#x27;s column sparked an outcry on Twitter, with professed rape victims recounting their stories of sexual assault and violence. In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, feminist blogger Jessica Valenti wrote: &quot;It takes a particular kind of ignorance to argue that people who come forward to report being raped in college are afforded benefits of any kind.&quot; In an open letter to Will, Senators Richard Blumenthal, Dianne Feinstein, Tammy Baldwin and Bob Casey wrote:

The &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; dropped Will&#x27;s column from its pages as a result of the column. Editor Tony Messenger wrote: &quot;The column was offensive and inaccurate; we apologize for publishing it.&quot; Will responded to the senators in his blog, saying his article was based on &quot;simple arithmetic involving publicly available reports&quot;, and that sexual assault &quot;should be dealt with by the criminal justice system, and not be adjudicated by improvised campus processes.&quot;

== Political views ==
=== Foreign policy and national security ===
Will once proposed that the United States withdraw all troops from Afghanistan, and defended Barack Obama&#x27;s response to the uprisings after the 2009 elections in Iran. He also criticized the Bush administration for engaging in warrantless surveillance, and supported trials for detainees at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. On immigration, Will supports tighter border security and a &quot;path to citizenship&quot; for illegal immigrants.

=== Social issues ===
Will argued that the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; Supreme Court decision caused a &quot;truncation of democratic debate about abortion policy&quot;. On crime, Will is opposed to the death penalty. He thinks that higher incarceration rates generally make the populace safer, but favors ending mandatory minimums. Additionally, Will is generally skeptical of affirmative action programs, and he favors the legalization of drugs.

=== Economic issues ===

Will is a libertarian-style conservative who supports deregulation and low taxes as he thinks these stimulate economic growth and are more morally fair. He was opposed to both George W. Bush and Barack Obama&#x27;s stimulus plans. Will supports abolishing the minimum wage and creating voluntary personal retirement accounts in order to reduce the federal cost of Social Security. In February 2013, Will wrote in support of a proposal by &quot;relentlessly liberal&quot; Sherrod Brown to break up consolidated banks and finance industry conglomerates, ending &quot;too big to fail&quot; by restoring the Glass-Steagall Act.

=== Campaign finance reform ===
Will opposes attempts to regulate campaign funding, arguing that any such legislation is unconstitutional and would unfairly favor incumbent politicians. Additionally, he contends that spending money is a form of free speech and political participation. By giving the government power to regulate speech, Will believes that this will make the government &quot;even bigger.&quot; Instead, he believes that we need &quot;more speech, advocating less government&quot; in order to reduce the importance of politics in our lives, thus indirectly reducing political spending.

== Criticism of Republican politicians ==
While identified with conservative politics, Will has criticized a number of individuals and policies associated with the Republican Party and American conservatism. He was among the first to oppose President George W. Bush&#x27;s nomination of Harriet Miers to the United States Supreme Court.

Will was hawkish in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and he expressed reservations about Bush administration Iraq policies. He eventually criticized what he said was an unrealistically optimistic set of political scenarios. In March 2006, in a column written in the aftermath of the apparently sectarian bombing of the Askariya Shrine in Samarra, Will challenged the Bush administration—and U.S. government representatives in Iraq—to be more honest about the difficulties the United States faced in rebuilding and maintaining order within Iraq, comparing the White House&#x27;s rhetoric unfavorably to that of Winston Churchill during the early years of World War II. Will described the optimistic assessments delivered from the Bush administration as the &quot;rhetoric of unreality.&quot; He criticized the Bush Iraq policy, and broader White House and congressional foreign and domestic policy making, in his keynote address for the Cato Institute&#x27;s 2006 Milton Friedman Prize dinner.

Will was also a harsh and early critic of both Sarah Palin and John McCain&#x27;s 2008 election campaign. He criticized Palin&#x27;s understanding of the role of the Vice President and her qualifications for that role. In late 2011, as the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries approached, Will said that frontrunner Newt Gingrich &quot;embodies almost everything disagreeable about modern Washington&quot;, and described him as &quot;the classic rental politician&quot;. In a 2013 interview with &quot;Reason&quot; writers Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch, Will said his views have gradually but steadily become more libertarian.

Will criticized Donald Trump several times during Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, calling him a &quot;one-man Todd Akin&quot;, and urged conservative voters to &quot;help him lose 50 states—condign punishment for his comprehensive disdain for conservative essentials.&quot; In turn, Trump criticized Will and brought attention to the fact that his wife Mari Maseng Will was an advisor to Scott Walker&#x27;s presidential campaign. Will criticized Trump again, saying Trump was a bigger threat than Hillary Clinton. In June 2016, citing his disapproval of Trump, Will told journalist Nicholas Ballasy in an interview that he had left the Republican Party and was registered as an unaffiliated voter.

In June 2019, Will asserted that the Republican Party had become a cult. Will supported Joe Biden in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Will has three children—Victoria, Geoffrey and Jonathan—with his first wife, Madeleine; their eldest child, Jonathan, was born in 1972 with Down syndrome, which Will has written about in his column on occasion. In 1989, he and Madeleine divorced after 22 years of marriage.

In 1991, Will married Mari Maseng. They have one child, a son named David, born in 1992 and live in Chevy Chase, Maryland, an affluent suburb of Washington, D.C. Maseng is a political consultant and speechwriter who was in charge of communications for the Rick Perry 2012 presidential campaign, and most recently worked on Scott Walker&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. She earlier worked on Michele Bachmann&#x27;s 2012 presidential campaign, and offered her services to the Mitt Romney 2012 campaign. She previously worked for Ronald Reagan as a presidential speechwriter, deputy director of transportation and Assistant to the President for Public Liaison. She also was a former communications director for Senator Bob Dole.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Will is a self-described &quot;amiable, low-voltage atheist&quot;. He was for quite a number of years a fairly active member of the Episcopal Church.

=== Interests ===
Will, a fan of both the Chicago Cubs and the Washington Nationals, has written extensively on baseball, including his best-selling book &quot;Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball&quot;. He was one of the many interview subjects for Ken Burns&#x27;s PBS documentary series &quot;Baseball&quot;.

== References in popular culture ==
Will was occasionally lampooned in the comic &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, particularly in a December 1980 sequence of strips in which several characters attend a party hosted by Will for the Reagans.

Will was lampooned in a skit on an April 1990 episode of the sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Dana Carvey played Will as the host of the fictional baseball trivia game show &quot;George F. Will&#x27;s Sports Machine&quot;, in which the answers are all highflown literary metaphors that leave the contestants befuddled; the exasperated contestants finally get Will to try to throw a baseball, which he is unable to do.

In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; season 6 episode &quot;The Jimmy&quot;, Kramer mentions that he finds George Will attractive. In the &quot;30 Rock&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Jack-Tor&quot;, Tracy Jordan remarks while reading a newspaper that George Will &quot;just gets more and more conservative.&quot;

<doc id="620110" wikidata="Q2299449" url="?curid=620110" title="Raggare">
<text>Raggare is a subculture found mostly in Sweden and parts of Norway and Finland, and to a lesser extent in Denmark, Germany, and Austria. Raggare are related to the American greaser and rockabilly subcultures and are known for their love of hot rod cars and 1950s American pop culture. Loosely translated into English, the term is roughly equivalent to the American &quot;greaser&quot;, English &quot;rocker&quot;, and Australian &quot;Bodgie&quot; and &quot;Widgie&quot; culture; all share a common passion for mid-20th-century American cars, rockabilly-based music and related fashion (blue-collar in origin, consisting of the likes of white T-shirts, loose fitting denim trousers with rolled cuffs, and canvas top sneakers such as Keds or Converse Chucks, or low-topped boots of an industrial nature).

While the raggare movement has its roots in late 1950s youth counterculture, today it is associated mainly with middle-aged men who enjoy meeting and showing off their retro American cars. However, the subculture retains its rural and small-town roots as well as its blue collar and low brow feel. The original phenomenon unleashed moral panic but the contemporary raggare subculture tends to be met with amusement or mild disapproval by mainstream society.

== Description==
===Influences===
The Raggare subculture&#x27;s influences are American popular culture of the 1950s, such as the movies &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; with James Dean, and &quot;American Graffiti&quot;.

===Cars===
Cars are an important part of the subculture, especially V8-powered cars and other large cars from the United States. Statistically, the most common raggare car () is the 1960s Pontiac Bonneville. They are plentiful, classic, relatively cheap, and have a huge backseat so the Raggare can pile in all of their friends. Raggare have been described as closely related to the hot rod culture, but while hotrodders in the US have to do extensive modifications to their cars to stand out, raggare can use stock US cars and still stand out compared to the more sober Swedish cars. Some raggare also drive European cars from the 1950s, 1960s and the 1970s.

According to an estimate by one Swedish car restorer, there are more restored 1950s American cars in Sweden than in the entire United States and although only two 1958 Cadillac convertibles were sold in Sweden there are now 200 of them in Sweden. Between 4000 and 5000 classic US cars were at one point imported to Sweden each year.

The latest generation of raggare, the so-called pilsnerraggare such as the club Mattsvart who was the subject of the 2019 documentary &quot;Raggarjävlar&quot; (&quot;Greaser scum&quot;) do not show much interest in restoring vintage cars, instead opting for driving around in trashed old US cars, drinking alcohol and playing loud music, not necessarily the rockabilly and classic rock traditionally preferred by raggare.
===Fashion===
The clothes and hairstyle are that of 1950s rockabilly. Blue jeans, cowboy boots, white T-shirts, sometimes with print (also used to store a pack of cigarettes by folding the sleeve), leather or denim jacket. The hair is styled using Brylcreem or some other pomade.

===Symbols===
The display of the battle flag of the Confederate States is popular in the subculture, as followers view it as a symbol of rebellion and American culture. They do not view it as a symbol of slavery or racism.

== History ==
Formation of the raggare culture was aided by Sweden staying neutral during World War II and untouched by the war. As a result, Sweden&#x27;s infrastructure remained intact and export economy boomed, which made it possible for the working-class Swedish youth to buy cars, in contrast to most of Europe, which needed to be rebuilt.

When raggare first appeared in the 1950s, they caused a moral panic with concerns about the use of alcohol, violence, high-speed driving, and having sex in the back seat. Raggare gangs were seen as a serious problem. The film &quot;Raggare!&quot; covered the issue in 1959.

One especially infamous raggare gang was Stockholm-based &quot;Road Devils&quot;, formed in the late 1950s by Bosse &quot;Gamen&quot; Sandberg (1939-1994), which was very heavily publicized in the press. The name of the gang originated from a 1957 movie Hot Rod Rumble, which featured a gang by the same name.

Later, raggare often got into fights with hippies and punks, something described in the punk rock song &quot;Raggare Is a Bunch of Motherfuckers&quot; by Rude Kids (and later re-recorded by Turbonegro). When The Sex Pistols played in Sweden on 28 July 1977, a group of raggare waited outside and cornered some young girls who came out from the show. The girls had safety pins through their cheeks, and the raggare ripped them out of their faces. The band was upstairs drinking beer when they heard about it. Sid Vicious wanted to go down and fight, and someone else suggested they should get the limousine and run them over. In the end, the gig promoter called the police.
The Hjo band Reklamation was forced to cancel a gig after threats from raggare. Also, Rude Kids was forced to cancel a sold-out gig as the police didn&#x27;t have the manpower to offer protection against raggare. When Rude Kids played in Stockholm the police had to bring in seven police cars to stop the raggare. When The Stranglers played in Sweden, their followers were caught making Molotov cocktails, and the police intervened after a fight broke out.

In 1996, the Swedish post office issued a stamp featuring raggare.

Because of their mostly rural roots, retro-aesthetics and attitude towards sex, raggare are often depicted as poorly educated and financially unsuccessful. A famous example is the 1990s TV series, &quot;Ronny and Ragge&quot;, a pair of stereotypical raggare who cruise around in a beat-up Ford Taunus. There are several periodic gatherings for raggare around Sweden. The Power Big Meet is the most famous, and is also one of the biggest American car meets in the world.

== In the media and other popular culture ==
*In 1975, then glam rocker Magnus Uggla made the song &quot;Raggarna&quot;, which was a tribute to the culture. When performing live in late 1970s and early 1980s, raggare threw rocks and tried to thrash the arenas in which Uggla performed, accusing him of being a punk rocker due to his success with the more punk-oriented albums he released in the late 1970s.
*Eddie Meduza have performed songs like &quot;Punkjävlar&quot; (&quot;Punk Bastards&quot;), or &quot;Ragga runt,&quot; a tribute to the Raggare subculture.
*Rude Kids made a song about raggare (later re-recorded by Turbonegro) called &quot;Raggare Is a Bunch of Motherfuckers&quot;, as an answer to &quot;punkjävlar&quot; by Eddie Meduza. The large number of punk songs about raggare shows the conflict between the two subcultures.
*The 1959 film &quot;Raggare!&quot; was about raggare and the moral panic of the time.
*The TV series &quot;Ronny and Ragge&quot; is about two raggare who cruise around in a beat-up 1976 - 1994 Ford Taunus.
*Onkel Kånkel made a song about raggare behaviour during cruising called &quot;Åka femtitalsbil&quot; (later covered by Charta 77).
* The early Swedish punk band P.F. Commando has issued a song called &quot;Raggare&quot; on their 1978 &quot;Svenne Pop&quot; 7-inch EP
* Raggargänget (1962) with Ernst-Hugo Järegård and Sigge Fürst
* Massproduktion published a compilation album titled &quot;Vägra Raggarna Bensin – Punk Från Provinserna&quot;.
* On 1 May 1979 about 100 punks formed their own parade down Kungsgatan under the slogan &quot;&quot;Vägra raggarna bensin&quot; (&quot;Refuse the raggare gasoline&quot;).
* Nadja&#x27;s brothers &quot;Roffe&quot;, &quot;Ragge&quot; and Reinhold, Bert
* &quot;Tjenare Kungen&quot; (2005)

<doc id="620114" wikidata="Q3050619" url="?curid=620114" title="Holywell, Flintshire">
<text>Holywell ( ; ) is a market town and community in Flintshire, Wales. It lies to the west of the estuary of the River Dee. The community includes Greenfield. In 2011, it had a population of 8,886.

==Etymology==
The name Holywell is literally &#x27; + &#x27; in reference to St Winefride&#x27;s Well, which is situated in the town. Similarly, its Welsh name, &#x27;, is a compound of &#x27; &quot;town&quot; + &quot;&quot; &quot;well&quot;, meaning &quot;town of [the] well&quot;.

==History==

The market town of Holywell is known for St Winefride&#x27;s Well, a holy well surrounded by a chapel. It has been a site of Christian pilgrimage since about 660, dedicated to Saint Winefride who, according to legend, was beheaded there by Caradog who attempted to attack her. The well is one of the Seven Wonders of Wales and the town bills itself as &quot;The Lourdes of Wales&quot;. Many pilgrims from all over the world continue to visit Holywell and the well.

From the 18th century, the town grew around the lead mining and cotton milling industries. The water supply from the mountains above the town, which flows continually and at a constant temperature, supplies the well and powered many factories in the Greenfield Valley. In addition to lead and cotton, copper production was of great importance. Thomas Williams, a lawyer from Anglesey, built factories and smelteries for copper in Greenfield Valley, bringing the copper from Anglesey to St. Helens and then to Greenfield Valley where it was used to make items including manilas (copper bracelets), neptunes (large flat dishes to evaporate seawater to produce salt) and copper sheathing. The copper sheathing was used to cover the hulls of the wooden ships trading in the warmer Caribbean waters, giving rise to the expression &#x27;copper bottomed investment&#x27;. The sheathing was also applied to Royal Navy ships and was instrumental in Nelson&#x27;s victories - two copper plates from HMS &quot;Victory&quot; are in Greenfield Valley Heritage Park museum. The wealth generated from these industries led to the development of the town. Holywell Town Hall was completed in 1896.

St James&#x27; Parish Church is a grade II* listed building and Holy Trinity Church in Greenfield is grade II listed. The town is also served by the modern St Peter&#x27;s Church on Rose Hill, consecrated in 2008.

===Railway===
Holywell Junction railway station in Greenfield was a stop on the North Wales Coast Line. The station was closed in 1966 and trains now run through the site; the station building, by Francis Thompson for the Chester and Holyhead Railway (1848), is listed Grade II*. There is a campaign to reopen the station.

Holywell Town railway station, at the head of the steeply-climbing LNWR Holywell branch line from Holywell Junction, opened in 1912 and finally closed in 1957. It now forms part of the &quot;Greenfield Valley&quot;, a tarmacked path.

==Demography==
In the 2011 census the population of the community, which includes the village of Greenfield, was recorded as 8,886. 
The census figure for the larger Holywell built-up area was 9,808.

The community consists of four electoral wards of the Flintshire County Council local authority:

==Geography==

Holywell is split into four distinct areas: Pen-y-Maes, the Strand, the Holway and the town centre. The Holway, located on the west side of the town, is the largest of the residential areas of Holywell. The near-contiguous village of Greenfield is located to the north east of the town on the B5121 road.

Villages within the Holywell catchment area include: Bagillt, Brynford, Carmel, Gorsedd, Halkyn, Holway, Lixwm, Lloc, Mostyn, Pantasaph, Pentre Halkyn, Rhes-y-Cae, Trelawnyd, Whitford and Ysceifiog. In addition there are other smaller scattered communities within this area. All of these are within a six-mile radius of Holywell. These villages are all connected to Holywell by a frequent bus service.

==Amenities==
The town centre contains many small businesses and national stores, serving not only the shopping needs of the people of the town itself, but also those of the surrounding villages within the town&#x27;s natural catchment area. Part of the centre of the historic market town has been designated a conservation area.

The town contains a secondary school, with over 500 pupils, and four primary schools. There is also a leisure centre.

The old cottage hospital was located in Pen-y-Maes until it closed. A new facility, known as the Holywell Community Hospital, opened in March 2008.

In 2007, a group of locals proposed a circular walk way, the &quot;St Beuno&#x27;s Circular Walk&quot;, joining all of the historical and religious locations of the town.

==Sport==
Holywell has a local football team, Holywell Town who play in the Cymru North league, the second tier of Welsh football.

Although Holywell does not have a cricket team carrying the name of the town, a number of junior and senior cricketers from the area play for nearby village team Carmel &amp; District Cricket Club; their ground is located a short distance from Holywell between the villages of Carmel and Lloc.

<text>The Peaceful Revolution () – also, in German called (, &quot;the turning point&quot;) – was one of the peaceful revolutions of 1989 at the peak of the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in the late 1980s. A process of sociopolitical change that led to, among other openings, the opening of their borders to the Western world. 

These events were precipited by Solidarity&#x27;s peaceful revolution in Poland and enabled by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s decision to abandon intervention in the Soviet sphere of influence and other shifts to the Soviet Union&#x27;s foreign policy.

In East Germany—the former German Democratic Republic (GDR or DDR)—the peaceful revolution marks the end of the ruling by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1989 and the transition to a parliamentary system. This peaceful transition later enabled the German reunification in October 1990. The peaceful revolution was marked by nonviolent initiatives and demonstrations.

The GDR&#x27;s lack of competitiveness in the global market economy, as well as its sharply rising national debt, hastened the destabilization of the SED&#x27;s one-party state, similar to destabilization of such regimes in other Eastern Bloc countries.

== Reunification ==
Because of its hostile response to the reforms implemented within its &quot;socialist brother lands&quot;, the SED leadership was already increasingly isolated within the Eastern Bloc when it permitted the opening of the border at the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989. Through a change in leadership and a willingness to negotiate, the SED attempted to win back the political initiative, but control of the situation increasingly lay with the West German government under Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

From December 1989, the GDR government of Prime Minister Hans Modrow was influenced by the Central Round Table, which put into action the dissolution of the Stasi and prepared free elections. After an election win for a coalition of parties that supported German reunification, the political path within the GDR was clear.

Despite previously hoping to rehabilitate their nation, East German activists eventually supported reunification. East German citizens welcomed the German reunification following 40 years of repression and inaction by the East German elites.

== Soviet policy toward the Eastern Bloc ==
A fundamental shift in Soviet policy toward the Eastern Bloc nations under Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s was the prelude to widespread demonstrations against the Socialist Unity Party, which had ruled East Germany since the country was founded on 7 October 1949. Previous uprisings – East Germany (1953), Czechoslovakia (1953), Poland (1956), Hungary (1956) and the Prague Spring (1968) – were harshly put down by Soviet troops. The Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980–1981 was already one of non-intervention.

Having initiated a policy of &quot;glasnost&quot; (openness) and emphasized the need for &quot;perestroika&quot; (economic restructuring), in July 1989, Gorbachev permitted the Warsaw Pact nations to initiate their own political and economic reforms within the terms of the treaty.

The policy of non-interference in Soviet Bloc countries&#x27; internal affairs was made official with Gorbachev&#x27;s statement on 26 October 1989 that the &quot;Soviet Union has no moral or political right to interfere in the affairs of its East European neighbors&quot;. This was dubbed the Sinatra Doctrine, by Gorbachev&#x27;s spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov who joked &quot;You know the Frank Sinatra song, &#x27;I Did It My Way&#x27;? Hungary and Poland are doing it their way.&quot;

=== East German reaction to Soviet reforms ===

Following the reforms, by 1988 relations had soured between Gorbachev and Honecker, although the relationship of KGB and the Stasi was still close.

In November 1988, the distribution of the Soviet monthly magazine &quot;Sputnik&quot;, was prohibited in East Germany because its new open political criticisms annoyed upper circles of the GDR leadership. This caused a lot of resentment and helped to activate the opposition movement. After a year, the sale of the magazine was reinstated, and censored editions of the issues from the preceding year were made available in a special edition for East Germans.

== Economy of East Germany ==
East Germany&#x27;s economy was stronger than other Eastern Bloc countries and it was the most successful of the CMEA countries. It was the Soviet Union&#x27;s most important trading partner, although it was very much subordinate. It was a net exporter of technology. Its shared language, cultural and personal connections with West Germany helped to boost its economy. Its trade with West Germany was 50 to 60 percent of its total trade with Western nations.
Although it was hailed as a communist success story, by the late 1980s its economic growth had slowed to less than 1% per year and the government&#x27;s economic goals were not reached. It had to deal with increasing global competition with run-down industrial infrastructure, and shortages of labour and raw materials. From 1986, its products were often seen as inferior and orders delivered to the Soviet Union were increasingly rejected due to poor quality control standards. Other communist countries were pursuing market-led reforms, but the government of Erich Honecker rejected such changes, claiming they contradicted Marxist ideology. More than one-fifth of the government&#x27;s income was spent on subsidising the costs of housing, food and basic goods.

Poor sewerage and industrial infrastructure led to major environmental problems. Half the country&#x27;s domestic sewage was untreated, as was most industrial waste. Over a third of all East Germany&#x27;s rivers, and almost a third of its reservoirs and half of its lakes were severely polluted. Its forests were damaged by sulphur dioxide and air pollution in cities was a problem. Protests about these environmental problems played a large part in the Peaceful Revolution.

Workers in East Germany earned more than those in other communist countries and they had better housing than most of them. But East German workers compared themselves with West Germans, who were much better off, which was another cause of dissatisfaction.

== Electoral fraud in the GDR ==
In practice, there was no real choice in GDR elections, which consisted of citizens voting to approve a pre-selected list of National Front candidates. The National Front was, in theory, an alliance of political parties, but they were all controlled by the SED party, which controlled the Volkskammer, the East German parliament. The results of elections were generally about 99% &quot;Yes&quot; in favour of the list. However, before the 7 May 1989 election there were open signs of citizens&#x27; dissatisfaction with the government and the SED was concerned that there could be a significant number of &quot;No&quot; votes. The number of applications for an &quot;Ausreiseantrag&quot; (permission to leave the country) had increased and there was discontent about housing conditions and shortages of basic products.

In the weeks before the election, opposition activists called for it to be boycotted, and distributed a leaflet criticising Erich Honecker&#x27;s regime. Nevertheless, the result of the election was proclaimed as 98.5 percent &quot;Yes&quot;. Clear evidence of electoral fraud was smuggled to the West German media. When this information was broadcast, it was picked up in East Germany, instigating protests.

Citizens demanded their legal right to observe the vote count. Election monitors from churches and other groups showed the figures had been falsified. About 10 percent of voters had put a line through every name on the list, indicating a &quot;No&quot; vote, and about 10 percent of the electorate had not voted at all. After the initial protests on 7 May, there were demonstrations on the seventh of every month in Alexanderplatz in Berlin.

== Gaps in the Iron Curtain ==
=== Enemies of the state ===
The Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc states had strongly isolationist policies and they developed complex systems and infrastructure to restrict their citizens travel beyond the Iron Curtain. About 3.5 million people left the GDR for West Germany before the building of the Berlin Wall and the Inner German border in August 1961. After that it was still possible to leave legally, by applying for and receiving an (permission to leave). Between 1961 and 1988 about 383,000 people left this way.

The government also forcibly exiled people, and political prisoners and their families could be ransomed to the West German government, although those involved had no choice in the matter. Between 1964 and 1989 a recorded 33,755 political prisoners and about 250,000 of their relatives and others were &quot;sold&quot; to West Germany.

Most of those who tried to escape illegally after 1961 travelled to other Eastern Bloc countries, as they believed their western borders were easier to breach than East Germany&#x27;s. Around 7,000–8,000 East Germans escaped through Bulgaria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia between 1961 and 1988. However, the majority of attempts were thwarted and those caught were arrested and sent back to face the East German legal system. Some were also shot and killed by border guards. 

=== Opening of the Hungarian and Czechoslovak borders ===

The Hungarian leader, János Kádár, retired on 22 May 1988 and other political parties were formed which challenged the old socialist order in Hungary, leading to a period of liberalisation. Almost a year later, on 2 May 1989, the Hungarian government began dismantling its border fence with Austria. This encouraged East German citizens to start travelling to Hungary in the hope of being able to get to the west more easily, not only over the border, but also by going to the West German embassy in Budapest and seeking asylum. On 27 June 1989 the Hungarian foreign minister Gyula Horn and his Austrian counterpart Alois Mock symbolically cut the border fence just outside Sopron. After the demolition of the border facilities, the patrols of the heavily armed Hungarian border guards were tightened and there was still a shooting order.

On 10 August 1989, Hungary announced it would be further relaxing its handling of first-time East German border offenders, which had already become lenient. It stamped the passports of people caught trying to illegally cross the border, rather than arresting them or reporting them to the East German authorities; first-time offenders would just get a warning, and no stamp. It also announced a proposal to downgrade illegal border crossing from a crime to a misdemeanour.

The Pan-European Picnic at the Austro-Hungarian border followed on 19 August 1989. This was a celebration of more open relationships between east and west, near Sopron, but on the Austrian side of the border. The opening of the border gate then set in motion a peaceful chain reaction, at the end of which there was no longer a GDR or an Iron Curtain, and the Eastern Bloc had disintegrated. The idea of opening the border at a ceremony came from Otto von Habsburg and was brought up by him to Miklós Németh, the then Hungarian Prime Minister, who promoted the idea. The border was temporarily opened at 3 p.m., and 700–900 East Germans, who had travelled there after being tipped off, rushed across, without intervention from Hungarian border guards. It was the largest escape movement from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. The local organization in Sopron took over the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the other contacts were made via Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay. Extensive advertising for the planned picnic was made by posters and flyers among the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary. The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting them to a picnic near the border at Sopron. Habsburg and Imre Pozsgay saw the event also as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev’s reaction to an opening of the border on the Iron Curtain. In particular, it was examined whether Moscow would give the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary the command to intervene. The West German government was already prepared for the mass escape, and trains and coaches were ready to take the escapees from Vienna to Giessen, near Frankfurt, where a refugee reception centre was waiting for the new arrivals. After the Pan-European Picnic, Erich Honecker dictated to the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; of August 19, 1989: “Habsburg distributed leaflets far into Poland, on which the East German holidaymakers were invited to a picnic. When they came to the picnic, they were given gifts, food and Deutsche Mark, and then they were persuaded to come to the West.” But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic, the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-intervention of the Soviet Union broke the dams.

About 100,000 East Germans then travelled to Hungary, hoping to also get across the border. Many people camped in the garden of the West German embassy in Budapest, in parks and around the border areas. Although the East German government asked for these people to be deported back to the GDR, Hungary, which had signed the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees on 14 March 1989, refused.

From 10 September 1989, the Hungarian government allowed all East Germans to cross the Austro-Hungarian border without hindrance. Tens of thousands left and many also travelled to Czechoslovakia, whose government also gave in to demands to open its western border.

The East German government gave in to pressure to allow special trains carrying East German refugees from Prague to West Germany, to travel via East Germany. Between the first and eighth of October 1989, 14 so-called &quot;Freedom Trains&quot; (German: ) carried a total of 12,000 people to Hof, in Bavaria. Large crowds gathered to cheer the trains as they passed.

As a result of new hopes inspired by the mass exodus of East Germans via Hungary, several opposition groups formed in Autumn 1989, with the aim of bringing about the same sorts of reforms in the GDR that had been instituted in Poland and Hungary.

The largest of these was the New Forum (German:&quot;Neues Forum&quot;). It was founded by the artist Bärbel Bohley along with Jens Reich and Jutta Seidel. It had over 200,000 members within a few weeks of being set up. On 20 September 1989 it applied to field candidates in the March 1990 general election. New Forum acted as an umbrella organisation for activist groups across the country. Other new political organisations including Democratic Awakening, United Left, and the Socialist Democratic Party formed. They all had similar aims, wanting greater democracy and environmental reforms.

== Decisive events of 1989 ==
=== Tiananmen Square protests ===
East Germans could see news about the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstration between April and June 1989 on West German television broadcasts. When the Chinese regime brutally crushed the demonstration on 3–4 June, several hundred and possibly several thousand protesters were killed. This caused concern for the nascent East German protest movement, that had demonstrated against electoral fraud in May. &quot;We too feared the possibility of a &#x27;Chinese solution,&#x27;&quot; said Pastor Christian Fuehrer of the Nikolaikirche in Leipzig.

The &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot;, the official newspaper of the SED, supported the crackdown by the Chinese authorities. The German People&#x27;s Congress proclaimed it was &quot;a defeat for counter-revolutionary forces.&quot; Sixteen civil rights activists in East Berlin were arrested for protesting against the actions of the Chinese government.

However, growing political agitation in East Germany was part of wider liberalisation within the Soviet bloc resulting from Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms – the country was not as isolated as China. Although Gorbachev visited Beijing in May 1989 to normalize Sino-Soviet relations, and the Chinese people were enthusiastic about his ideas, he had no influence with the Chinese government. Rather than stifle the East Germans&#x27; protests, the Tiananmen Square demonstration was further inspiration for their desire to instigate change.

=== 40th anniversary of GDR ===

Celebrations for Republic Day on 7 October 1989, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR, were marred by demonstrations. There had been protests in the preceding weeks, and Hungary and Czechoslovakia now allowed East Germans to travel freely across their borders to the west. From 1 to 8 October, 14 &quot;Freedom Trains&quot; took 12,000 East German refugees from Prague across GDR territory to West Germany, with cheers from East Germans as they passed. All were signs that the anniversary, which Mikhail Gorbachev attended, would not run smoothly.

Although there were almost 500,000 Soviet troops stationed in the GDR, they were not going to help suppress any demonstrations. It later emerged that Gorbachev had ordered that the troops were to stay in their barracks during the commemorations. As the reformist Gorbachev was paraded along Unter den Linden, cheering crowds lining the street called out &quot;Gorbi, Gorbi,&quot; and &quot;Gorbi, help us.&quot; However, there were still fears of a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown, as on 2 October, the SED party official Egon Krenz was in Beijing, at the anniversary of the founding of People&#x27;s Republic of China. There, he said, &quot;In the struggles of our time, the GDR and China stand side by side.&quot;

On 7 October, a candelight demonstration with 1,500 protesters around Gethsemane Church in Prenzlauer Berg, Berlin was crushed by security forces, who beat people up and made around 500 arrests. Other protests outside the Palace of the Republic were also brutally repressed.

There were protests throughout the country, the most organised being three consecutive demonstrations in Saxony on 7, 8 and 9 October in Plauen, Dresden and Leipzig respectively. In Leipzig, there was no violence, as the 70,000 participants were too many for the 8,000 armed security forces present to tackle. &quot;The message from Leipzig soared over the entire country: The masses had the power to topple the regime peacefully&quot;.

When numerous East Germans were arrested for protesting the 40th-anniversary celebrations, many of them sang &quot;The Internationale&quot; in police custody to imply that they, rather than their captors, were the real revolutionaries.

On 18 October, only eleven days after these events, Honecker was removed as head of the party and the state and was replaced by Egon Krenz.

=== Weekly demonstrations ===
In addition to the GDR 40th anniversary demonstrations and the protests against electoral fraud, from September 1989 there were regular weekly pro-democracy demonstrations in towns and cities across the country. They are referred to as &quot;Monday demonstrations&quot; as that was the day they occurred in Leipzig, where they started, but they were staged on several days of the week. In Erfurt, for example, they happened on Thursdays. The first wave of these was from 4 September 1989 to March 1990. They continued sporadically until 1991.

The protesters called for an open border with West Germany, genuine democracy, and greater human rights and environmental protections. The most noted slogan protesters shouted was &quot;Wir sind das Volk&quot; (&quot;We are the people&quot;), meaning that in a real democracy, the people determine how the country is governed. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, in demonstrations calling for German reunification, this morphed into &quot;Wir sind ein Volk&quot; (&quot;We are one people&quot;).

Churches were often pivotal in the demonstrations. The Leipzig &quot;Monday demonstrations&quot; stemmed from Monday prayer meetings at the Nikolaikirche (Church of St Nicholas). Prayers were said for people who had been mistreated by the state authorities, so the meetings took on a political character. The numbers attending grew and on 4 September 1989, it became a demonstration of over 1000 people in front of the church. The Stasi arrived to break it up, taking some demonstrators away in trucks.
The demonstrations became a regular weekly event in Leipzig and around the country, with tens of thousands joining in. There were mass arrests and beatings at the Leipzig demonstrations on 11 September and going through until 2 October. After the demonstration on 9 October, in which the security forces were completely outnumbered by the 70,000 protesters and unable to hinder them, the demonstrations in Leipzig and elsewhere remained relatively peaceful. The largest gatherings were the Alexanderplatz demonstration in Berlin on 4 November 1989, and 11 November in Leipzig, each with an estimated 500,000 protesters, although there are claims that up to 750,000 were at the Berlin demonstration.

On the 28 October 1989, to try to calm the protests, an amnesty was issued for political prisoners being held for border crimes or for participation in the weekly demonstrations.

The first wave of demonstrations ended in March 1990 due to the forthcoming free parliamentary elections on 18 March.

=== Plan X ===
On 8 October 1989, Erich Mielke and Erich Honecker ordered the Stasi to implement &quot;Plan X&quot;—the SED&#x27;s plan to arrest and indefinitely detain 85,939 East Germans during a state of emergency. According to John Koehler, Plan X had been in preparation since 1979 and was, &quot;a carbon copy of how the Nazi concentration camps got their start after Hitler came to power in 1933.&quot;

By 1984, 23 sites had been selected for &quot;isolation and internment camps.&quot; Those who were to be imprisoned in them ran into six categories; including anyone who had ever been under surveillance for anti-state activities, including all members of peace movements which were not under Stasi control.

According to Anna Funder:

However, when Mielke sent the orders, codenamed &quot;Shield&quot; (), to each local Stasi precinct to begin the planned arrests, he was ignored. Terrified of an East German version of the mass lynchings of Hungarian secret police agents during the 1956 Revolution, Stasi agents throughout the GDR fortified their office-buildings and barricaded themselves inside.

=== Ruling party starts to lose power ===

On 18 October 1989, the 77-year-old Erich Honecker was replaced as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party by Egon Krenz. After the vote to oust Honecker passed, Stasi chief Erich Mielke &quot;got nasty,&quot; and accused Honecker of political corruption. Honecker responded that Mielke should not open his mouth so much. Mielke responded by putting the last nail in Honecker&#x27;s coffin. He announced that the Stasi had a file on the now-ousted leader. It contained proof of Honecker&#x27;s corrupt business practices, sexual activities, and how, as a member of the underground Communist Party of Germany during the Nazi years, he had been arrested by the Gestapo and had named names.

Officially Honecker resigned due to ill health, but he had been sharply criticized by the party. Although Krenz, 52, was the youngest member of the Politburo, he was a hardliner who had congratulated the Chinese regime on its brutal crushing of the Tiananmen Square demonstration. The New Forum were doubtful about his ability to bring about reform, saying that &quot;he would have to undertake &#x27;tremendous efforts&#x27; to dispel the mistrust of a great part of the population.&quot;

Günter Mittag, who was responsible for managing the economy, and , editor of the &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot; and head of propaganda, were also removed from office.

On 7 November 1989, the entire Cabinet of the East German government, the 44-member Council of Ministers, led by Prime Minister Willi Stoph, resigned as a consequence of the political upheaval caused by the mass exodus of citizens via the Hungarian and Czechoslovakian borders and the ongoing protests. The Politburo of the SED remained the real holders of political power. Over 200,000 members of the SED had left the party during the previous two months. Hans Modrow became the prime minister and 17 November he formed a 28-member Council of Minister which included 11 non-SED ministers.

Krenz, the last SED leader of the GDR, was only in office for 46 days, resigning on 3 December, along with the rest of the SED Politburo and the Central Committee of the party. The country was then in practice run by Prime Minister Modrow. Krenz was succeeded as head of state by Manfred Gerlach.

=== Fall of the Berlin Wall and border opening ===

After Hungary and Czechoslovakia allowed East Germans to cross to the west via their borders, there was nothing the GDR government could to do to prevent people leaving. Between 4–5 November, the weekend before the Berlin Wall was opened, over 50,000 people left. Party official Günter Schabowski announced at a press conference on the evening of Thursday 9 November 1989 that East Germans were free to travel through the checkpoints of the Berlin Wall and the inner German border.

After some initial confusion, with 20,000 people arriving at the Bornholmer Straße border crossing by 11.30 p.m., chanting &quot;Open the gate&quot;, Harald Jäger, a border official, allowed people to pass through into West Berlin. Over the next few days streams of cars queued at the checkpoints along the Berlin Wall and the inner German border to travel through to West Germany.

From 10 November, East Germans who had crossed the border queued outside West German banks to collect their Begrüßungsgeld (&quot;Welcome Money&quot;). This was a payment that the West German government had given to visiting East Germans since 1970. In 1989 the amount was 100 Deutsche Marks once per year. Because East Germans&#x27; travel to the west had been very restricted, until the middle of the 1980s only about 60,000 visitors had received &quot;Welcome Money&quot;. However, between 9 and 22 November alone, over 11 million East Germans had crossed into West Berlin or West Germany. In November and December about 4 billion DM was paid out, and the system was stopped on 29 December 1989.

== Die Wende ==
&quot;Die Wende&quot; translates into &quot;the turn&quot; or &quot;the turning point&quot;. The term began to be used in reference to the Peaceful Revolution on 16 October 1989 in the magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. The term was first used publicly in East Germany on 18 October by the last communist leader Egon Krenz in a speech to the Volkskammer upon his election as General Secretary.

<text>The Chicago Politicians were a team formed in 1986 by Arena Football League founder Jim Foster to play an initial &quot;test game&quot; in Rockford, Illinois, at the MetroCentre. They were defeated by the Rockford Metros, 30–18. The test was deemed successful, as a four-team &quot;demonstration season&quot; was held the next year, and arena football has been played every year since, although the original Arena Football League itself ceased operations after its 2008 season, and the current organization of that name bought the rights to it in bankruptcy proceedings. Some Politicians players went on to play for the Chicago Bruisers and the other charter AFL teams, the Denver Dynamite, Pittsburgh Gladiators, and Washington Commandos.

<doc id="620124" wikidata="Q6938775" url="?curid=620124" title="Murli Deora">
<text>Murli Deora (10 January 1937 – 24 November 2014) was an Indian politician, businessman, and social worker. He was the Mayor of Mumbai, a Member of Parliament in both the Upper and Lower Houses, and a Minister of Cabinet rank. He was a member of the Indian National Congress.

==Early life==
Deora was born in Bombay in a Marwari family, and received his BA from Bombay University. His family came from Laxmangarh in Rajasthan.

==Landmark case==
In 2001, Deora won a landmark Supreme Court case that ended smoking in public places. In the absence of statutory provisions at that time, the Court prohibited smoking in public places such as auditoriums, hospital buildings, health institutions, educational institutions, libraries, court buildings, public offices, and public conveyances, including the railways.

==Political career==
The industrialist and social worker-turned-politician began his work with the Bombay Municipal Corporation in 1968 when he was elected as a corporator. Later, in 1977, Deora was elected mayor of Bombay with the support of Shiv Sena. He first contested the Lok Sabha polls from Bombay South constituency in 1980 but lost to the Janata Party&#x27;s Ratansingh Rajda though, in the subsequent election, Deora defeated BJP&#x27;s Jayawantiben Mehta by a huge margin. He was re-elected in 1989, 1991 but lost to Mehta in 1996 and 1999 before his son, Milind, defeated Mehta to go to the Lok Sabha from the same constituency in 2004. Deora is a trusted aide of the Gandhi family in Mumbai. He was elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2004 and was inducted in the Union cabinet as petroleum minister in January 2006.

From 29 January 2006 to 18 January 2011, he served as Union Minister for Petroleum and Natural Gas. From 18 January 2011 to 12 July 2011, he served as Minister of Corporate Affairs

He was president of the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee for 22 years from 1981 to 2003.

In the Congress re-election in 2009, Deora retained the portfolio of Petroleum and Natural Gas in the second government under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

==Philanthropy==

===Free computer education===
As Vice-Chairman of Bhavan&#x27;s Gandhi Institute of Computer Technology, Deora made it his mission to spread computer literacy for better job opportunities by kickstarting the Free Computer Education Program.

In 2000, he brought Bill Gates to the center, which received a US$ 5 million grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for its good work.

Today, the program has over 56 centres all over India, and over 3,56,519 people have benefited from it.

===Eye camps===
Deora believed everyone had the right to see properly, and organised over 78 eye camps in Mumbai, where more than 5000 to 7000 people have had their eyes tested and receive free spectacles, as well as free eye surgery and in every camp 300 to 400 Free Cataract operation with Pathological check-up for operation has been done.

==Personal life==
Murli Deora was married at a young age to Hema Deora, a lady from his own community and similar social background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian way. They had two sons.

One of their sons, Milind Murli Deora, followed his father into politics and was Lok Sabha member from Mumbai. He is married to Pooja Deora, daughter of Manmohan Shetty, founder of Adlabs, a prominent media and entertainment firm.

The couple&#x27;s other son, Mukul Deora, is married to Nitasha Deora. Born a member of the Thapar business family, Nitasha Deora is the daughter of Vikram Thapar and great-granddaughter of Karam Chand Thapar.

== Death and tributes ==
After Deora&#x27;s death, both houses of Parliament were adjourned on the first day of the winter session as a mark of respect for him, as well as other members who had died.

Tributes came in regardless of party lines, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing his sadness and describing Deora as &quot;a dedicated leader,&quot; whose &quot;warm nature made him popular across party lines.&quot;

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley penned a front-page tribute to Deora in &quot;The Times of India&quot;, calling him &quot;extremely helpful&quot; and someone whose &quot;strength lay in the fact that he never criticized even those he did not like&quot;.

HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said, &quot;he was a very warm and kind-hearted person, and never turned away any person who came seeking his help and always kept his word.&quot;

Pranay Gupta, for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, noted that, &quot;at a personal level, he was incorruptible&quot;, and that, &quot;perhaps more than any Indian politician of his generation, Murli was genuinely liked in public and private. That&#x27;s because he had a good word for all, and extended a helpful hand to many. To be a politician means to serve — and serve Murli did, in a land where ministers and bureaucrats often ignore the masses except during election time, where high officials expect their constituents to genuflect and undertake a thousand salaams before even being allowed to enter the corridors of power. But Murli&#x27;s door was always open.&quot;

Shankar Aiyar spoke about Deora&#x27;s humble beginnings, about &quot;the Murli who wore the same set of clothes — washed at night and ironed &quot;with a lotta with coal in it&quot;; the Murli who hung outside the neighbour&#x27;s window to listen to songs and studied under the street lamp at Babulnath&quot;, and how, as a powerful politician, he used his contacts to help the poor and needy. How &quot;every new billion-dollar acquaintance was converted into a philanthropist — convinced to donate a heart lung machine to a municipal hospital, pay for an eye camp, fund the computer literacy for jobs programme at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, and more.&quot;

<doc id="620129" wikidata="Q542055" url="?curid=620129" title="Sir Thomas More (play)">
<text>Sir Thomas More is an Elizabethan play and a dramatic biography based on events in the life of the Catholic martyr Thomas More, who rose to become the Lord Chancellor of England during the reign of Henry VIII. The play is considered to be written by Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle and revised by several writers. The manuscript is particularly notable for a three-page handwritten revision now widely attributed to William Shakespeare.

==Content==
This play is not a biography; it is a drama that deals with certain events in More&#x27;s life. Other significant facts are not described: There is no mention of his literary career, his book &quot;Utopia&quot;, or the dispute between Henry VIII and the Pope in Rome. Also the life of More is at times expanded beyond what actually occurred and beyond the sources that were used, in order to suit the drama. What the play is about has been debated, but the issues revolve around obedience to the crown and rule of law, particularly when a populace becomes stirred up in an anti-alien fervor. Even More must obey; when he does not he loses his life.

There are three primary actions in the drama: First is the uprising of 1517 known as Ill May Day and More&#x27;s quelling of the rioters. Second is the portrayal of More&#x27;s private life, his family and friendships, demonstrating his generosity, kindness, and wit. Third is his service as Privy Councillor and Lord Chamberlain, and the principled stand he took in opposition to the king, which leads to More&#x27;s execution.

The particular articles More refuses to sign are never described, so the play avoids the specific conflict that occurred between the Catholic Church and the breakaway English church, allowing the story to focus on the issue of freedom of an individual conscience from worldly authority. This explains why Munday, who fought against the Catholic Church, would be an author of a play that vindicates More, a Catholic martyr. Munday&#x27;s abiding interest, as demonstrated in his other plays, was in speaking out against attacks on an individual&#x27;s freedom, attacks that came from both church and state.

Considered in terms of theatrical performance, it is seen as effective and dramatic in the scenes dealing with the rioting, it is warm and human when dealing with More&#x27;s private life, and it is sympathetic and admiring as More sticks to his principles in the conclusion of the play. It is considered to be the best of the dramatic biographies that were written in Elizabethan times. Even with these qualities it would not have attracted as much interest if it were not for the association this play has with Shakespeare.

==Characters==
&quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; has an unusually high total of 59 speaking parts, including 22 in the first 500 lines of the play; this, plus crowd scenes, would have taxed the ability of any playing company of the time to stage it. The job could only be managed through complex doubling and more-than-doubling of roles by the actors. Out of necessity, the play is structured to allow for this multiple doubling of roles: it is set up in three phases—More&#x27;s rise; More&#x27;s Chancellorship; More&#x27;s fall—with very limited overlap between the thirds. Only three characters, More himself and the Earls of Shrewsbury and Surrey, appear in all three portions; seven other characters—Lady More, Clown Betts, Palmer, Roper, Sergeant Downes, the Lord Mayor, and a sheriff—appear in two of the three segments.

* Clown Betts – Ralph, his brother (Holinshed mentions two brothers named &quot;Bets&quot; who were sentenced to death but pardoned)
* Sherwin – goldsmith (mentioned in Holinshed as sentenced to death but pardoned)

== Synopsis ==
===Act I===
The play dramatises events in More&#x27;s life, and it deals with issues of obedience to the crown and rule of law, particularly when a populace has become stirred up in an anti-alien fervour. It consists of 17 scenes, four of them cancelled. It begins with the Ill May Day events of 1517: Foreign nationals, who have immigrated to England from Lombardy, which is the northern region of what is now known as Italy, are misbehaving in a variety of ways, and are treating the citizens of London with abuse and disrespect. This is outraging the workers of London, who decide to join together on May Day and seek revenge on the newcomers. London noblemen are having difficulty deciding what to do about this, when rioting breaks out all across London, and even the Mayor of London is endangered. The noblemen decide to engage Sheriff Thomas More, who is popular and respected by the people, to try and calm the civil unrest.

===Act II===
A group of native Londoners plan to set fire to the foreigners&#x27; homes. Others urge a military response. More decides the best way is for him to speak to the rioters.

More arrives at St. Martin&#x27;s gate. The rioters express their complaints, then agree to hear from More. More begins by saying that the riots are disgracing England, and that if disorder prevails, civil society will fall apart, and none of the rioters will live to an old age. He tells them that when they rebel against the law, they rebel against God. More offers a deal to the rioters: If they will behave, and go to prison in peace, he promises that they will be given a pardon. The only other option for them is death. The rioters accept More&#x27;s offer, and are taken away.

===Act III===
The rioters are about to be hanged. One of their leaders, Lincoln, has already been executed. Then Surrey arrives to announce that the execution order has been stayed by order of the King, because More has pleaded for their lives.

===Act IV===
More is knighted and promoted to Privy Councilor for his role in ending the riots.

At home, More is visited by his friend, the Dutch philosopher and theologian, Erasmus. More then hosts a visit by the Mayor of London. For the guests&#x27; entertainment, a play is performed, &quot;The Marriage of Wit and Wisdom&quot;.

Later in Whitehall, the Privy Council, including More, is meeting, when Sir Thomas Palmer enters with undisclosed articles from the King, King Henry VIII, who wants them signed. More refuses to sign, because he is conscientiously opposed. Rochester, who also refuses to sign, is taken away to the Tower of London. More resigns his office and is placed under house arrest. His fellow Privy Councilors urge him to change his mind and sign, but he will not.

More goes home and informs his family. He discusses the situation and how it will affect them, and he comforts them, all the while maintaining a positive demeanor and his moral position. The Earls of Surrey and Shrewsbury arrive to encourage More to sign the articles; he will not and is taken away to the Tower.

===Act V===
Catesby goes to More&#x27;s house to inform the family that More has been sentenced to death.

More&#x27;s family arrives at the Tower on the eve of his execution. They urge him to change his mind, but he is resolute. The next day, on Tower Hill, More is positive and resolved as he mounts the scaffold and prepares to die by beheading. More has thoughtful and considerate exchanges with the noblemen, who are present, and his executioner, and then is taken off-stage to his fate.

==Manuscript==
The original manuscript, involving so many revisions, has led to the view that the play has been pieced together or is in poor condition. However, the revisions are generally considered, in recognizable theatrical terms, as a script&#x27;s natural progression towards its being readied for production.

The original manuscript is a handwritten text, now owned by the British Library. The manuscript is notable for the light it sheds on the collaborative nature of Elizabethan drama and theatrical censorship of the era.

Now Harley MS 7368 in the collection of the British Library, the manuscript&#x27;s provenance can be traced back to 1728, when it belonged to a London book collector named John Murray. He donated it to the collection of Edward Harley, 3rd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, who bequeathed it to the British Museum with the rest of his manuscript collection in 1753. Some time between 1728 and 1753 the play was bound with another manuscript, &quot;The Humorous Lovers&quot;.

Now in poor condition, the original manuscript probably consisted of 16 leaves—31 handwritten pages of a working draft of the play (foul papers), with the last page blank. Two or three of the original leaves have been torn out, and seven leaves and two smaller pieces of paper have been inserted.

Aside from folios 1 and 2, the wrapper of the manuscript proper, the revised extant manuscript comprises the following:

1) Folios 3–5, Hand S: the first three scenes of the play, through page 5a; censored by Edmund Tylney, the Master of the Revels, but otherwise intact. On page 5b, all text after the first 16 lines is marked for deletion. At least one, and probably two, of the leaves immediately following (the original leaves 6 and 7) are missing.

2) Folio 6, Addition I, Hand A: a single leaf, written on only one side. The addition is misplaced, and belongs later in the play, with page 19a.&lt;br&gt;
3) Folios 7–9, Addition II: three leaves replacing the excised material on 5b and the original 6 and probable 7. Each of the three leaves is in a different hand.
* Folio 7a, Addition IIa, Hand B: a scene to replace a short deleted scene on 5b.
* Folio 7b, Addition IIb, Hand C: another complete scene, with stage directions leading to its successor.
* Folios 8–9, Addition IIc, Hand D: a three-page scene (page 9b being blank), with about a dozen corrections in Hand C.
4) Folios 10–11, Hand S: back to the original manuscript, though with some insertions on pages 10a and 11a in Hand B.

5) Folio 11c, Addition III, Hand C: the first of the two insertions on smaller pieces of paper, formerly pasted over the bottom of page 11b, and consisting of a single 21-line soliloquy meant to begin the next scene.

6) Folios 12–13, Addition IV, Hands C and E: four pages to replace excised or cancelled material, written mainly in Hand C but with input from Hand E on page 13b.

7) Folio 14a Hand S: the original again, and the whole page cancelled for deletion. Addition IV, directly previous, replaces this material.

8) Folio 14c, Addition V, Hand C: the second of the insertions on smaller sheets of paper, formerly pasted over the bottom of page 14a.

9) Folios 14b and 15, Hand S: the original again.

10) Folio 16, Addition VI, Hand B: the last of the six Additions.

11) Folios 17–22a, Hand S: the conclusion of the play in the original version. On page 19a a long passage is cut, and this is the place where the mislocated Addition I, folio 6, actually belongs.

Hand C attempted to provide corrections to the whole, enhancing its coherence; yet some stage directions and speech prefixes are missing, and the stage directions that exist are sometimes incorrect. (In Additions III and IV, More speaks his soliloquy before he enters.)

Scholars, critics, and editors have described the text as &quot;chaotic&quot; and &quot;reduced to incoherence&quot;, but in 1987 Scott McMillin maintained that the play could be acted as is; and at least one production of the play has ensued, by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005.

The manuscript was first printed and published in 1844, two and a half centuries after it was written, by the Shakespeare Society, edited by Alexander Dyce; and again in 1911 by the Malone Society, edited by W. W. Greg.

Part of the need for revisions of the play was clearly due to purely practical concerns of stagecraft, apart from the demands of political censorship. Much of the point of the revision was to streamline the play, to make it more actable; though even the revised version would have needed a minimum cast of 13–18 adults and five boys. Two of the Additions, III and VI, occur at the beginning and end of the middle third respectively, giving more time for costume changes. Addition III provides a soliloquy by More and a 45-line dialogue between two actors; Addition VI provides a similar breathing-space for the actors to get ready for the play&#x27;s final phase.

Allowing for a range of uncertainties, it is most likely true that the original text of &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; was written c. 1591–93, with a special focus on 1592–93 when the subject of hostility against &quot;aliens&quot; was topical in London. Edmund Tylney censored the play when it was submitted to him for approval at that time, for this topicality as well as for more general considerations of controlling political expression on the stage. The effort at revision is difficult to date; many scholars have favoured c. 1596, though a date as late as c. 1604 is also possible.

== Authorship ==
The manuscript is a complicated text containing many layers of collaborative writing, revision, and censorship. Scholars of the play think that it was originally written by playwrights Anthony Munday and Henry Chettle and some years later heavily revised by another team of playwrights, including Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, and William Shakespeare.

The most common identifications for the six hands:
* HAND S – Anthony Munday, the original manuscript;
* HAND A – Henry Chettle;
* HAND B – Thomas Heywood;
* HAND C – A professional scribe who copied out a large section of the play;
* HAND D – William Shakespeare;
* HAND E – Thomas Dekker.

Munday, Chettle, Dekker, and Heywood wrote for the Admiral&#x27;s Men during the years before and after 1600, which may strengthen the idea of a connection between the play and that company. Shakespeare, in this context, seems the odd man out. In his study of the play, Scott McMillin entertains the possibility that Shakespeare&#x27;s contribution might have been part of the original text from the early 1590s, when Shakespeare may have written for the Lord Strange&#x27;s Men.

=== Evidence for Shakespeare&#x27;s contribution ===
In 1871, Richard Simpson proposed that some additions to the play had been written by Shakespeare, and a year later James Spedding, editor of the works of Sir Francis Bacon, while rejecting some of Simpson&#x27;s suggestions, supported the attribution to Shakespeare of the passage credited to Hand D. In 1916, the paleographer Sir Edward Maunde Thompson published a minute analysis of the handwriting of the addition and judged it to be Shakespeare&#x27;s. The case was strengthened with the publication of &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More&quot; (1923) by five noted scholars who analysed the play from multiple perspectives, all of which led to the same affirmative conclusion. A second significant gathering of scholars to consider &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; grew out of a seminar that was held during the meeting of the Shakespeare Association of America at Ashland, Oregon in 1983. It resulted in a second book of essays, eight by eight different authors, that was published as &quot;Shakespeare and Sir Thomas More; Essays on the Play and its Shakespearean Interest&quot;. It is a comprehensive study of the manuscript, and states that it appears more likely than ever that Shakespeare did indeed contribute to the revision of this play. This would make it the only surviving manuscript text written by Shakespeare. Although some dissenters remain, the attribution has been generally accepted since the mid-20th century and most authoritative editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, including &quot;The Oxford Shakespeare&quot;, include the play. It was performed with Shakespeare&#x27;s name included amongst the authors by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005. The issue was supported and disputed over a long period on the evidence of literary style and Shakespeare&#x27;s distinctive handwriting. The lines in Hand D &quot;are now generally accepted as the work of Shakespeare.&quot; If the Shakespearean identification is correct, these three pages represent the only surviving examples of Shakespeare&#x27;s handwriting, aside from a few signatures on documents. The manuscript, with its numerous corrections, deletions and insertions, enables us to glimpse Shakespeare in the process of composition.

The evidence for identifying Shakespeare as Hand D is of various types:
* Handwriting similar to the six existing signatures of Shakespeare;
* Spellings characteristic of Shakespeare;
* Stylistic elements similar to Shakespeare&#x27;s acknowledged works.

The original perceptions of Simpson and Spedding in 1871–72 were based on literary style and content and political outlook, rather than palaeographic and orthographic considerations. Consider one example of what attracted attention to the style of Hand D.

First, from &quot;Sir Thomas More,&quot; Addition IIc, 84–87:

:::For other ruffians, as their fancies wrought,
:::With self same hand, self reasons, and self right,
:::Would &quot;shark&quot; on you, and men like ravenous &quot;fishes&quot;
:::&quot;Would feed on one another.&quot;

Next, from &quot;Coriolanus,&quot; I, i, 184–188:

:::::What&#x27;s the matter,
:::That in these several places of the city
:::You cry against the noble Senate, who
:::(Under the gods) keep you in awe, which else
:::&quot;Would feed on one another?&quot;

Thirdly, &quot;Troilus and Cressida,&quot; I, iii, 121–124:

:::And appetite, an universal wolf
:::(So doubly seconded with will and power)
:::Must make perforce an universal prey,
:::&quot;And last eat up himself.&quot;

Finally, &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre,&quot; II, i, 26–32:

:::&quot;3rd Fisherman:&quot;...Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
:::&quot;1st Fisherman:&quot; Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up
:::the little ones. I can compare our rich misers to nothing so fitly
:::as to a &quot;whale&quot;: &#x27;a plays and tumbles, driving the poor &quot;fry&quot; before him,
:::and at last &quot;devour them all at a mouthful.&quot;

Many features like this in the Hand D addition to &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; first attracted the attention of Shakespeare scholars and readers, and led to more intensive study from a range of specialised perspectives.

The British Library designates 147 lines of the playscript as &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s only surviving literary manuscript&quot;; curator Zoe Wilcox argued that &quot;all the evidence suggested the writing was by the hand of Shakespeare.&quot;.

In 2016 a rebuttal of the case for Hand D in the play having anything to do with Shakespeare was presented by professional paleographer Michael Hays. Published in &quot;Shakespeare Quarterly&quot;, Hays wrote, &quot;The history of the paleographic argument connecting &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; and Shakespeare is a narrative of ambiguous terms, misconceptions, and mistakes.&quot; He went on to write that the arguments presented were without scientific merit because there exists no control sample of Shakespeare&#x27;s writing. Paul Werstine similarly argues that &quot;the only handwriting that we know for certain are his... is too small a sample size to make any sort of reliable comparison.&quot;

===Audience perception===
Audiences &quot;find that the play speaks with more urgency&quot; in the pages attributed to Shakespeare. While Shakespeare&#x27;s supposed contribution is consistent with the overall theme and develops the plot, there is an impression of a virtuoso piece inserted, but not completely integrated, into the play. Some editors go as far as to question whether Shakespeare had read any of the other contributions at all.

==Performance history==
The play was most likely written to be acted by Lord Strange&#x27;s Men, the only company of the time that could have mounted such a large and demanding production, at Philip Henslowe&#x27;s Rose Theatre, which possessed the special staging requirements (large-capacity second-level platform and special enclosure) called for by the play. The massive lead role of More, 800-plus lines, was designed for Edward Alleyn, the only actor up to that time who is known to have played such large-scale roles. After the re-organization of the playing companies in 1594, the manuscript may well have passed into the possession of the Admiral&#x27;s Men.

Whether or not the play was performed in the Elizabethan or Jacobean age is unsettled, and there are indications to support both sides of the question. By the nature of the revisions and the mention of the actor Thomas Goodale in 3.1 it is clear that it was written for the public stage. Since that time no recorded performance of &quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; took place until a three-night student production by the Birkbeck College, University of London, in December 1922. The play was staged with more than 40 students at the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury, 4–6 November 1938, with P. D. V. Strallen in the title role. The first known professional staging of the play was 22–29 June 1954 at the London Theatre Centre for the Advance Players Association. It was first performed in Elizabethan costumes and then in modern dress, with Michael Beint as More.

&quot;Sir Thomas More&quot; has been acted in whole or in part several times as a radio play, twice by the BBC Third Programme (1948, 1956), by the Austrian public radio ORF in 1960, and then again by BBC Radio 3 in 1983 with Ian McKellen playing the title role. McKellen also played the role at the Nottingham Playhouse 10 June–4 July 1964, taking over from John Neville on short notice, when the latter had artistic differences with director Frank Dunlop during rehearsals.

The play has been infrequently revived since, Nigel Cooke playing More for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2005.

Sir Ian McKellen performed the Hand D monologue regarding immigrants on the Marc Maron podcast in response to the Trump phenomenon, as well as during his visit to the Oxford Union in 2017.

The name Prestatyn derives from the Old English &quot;prēosta&quot; (the genitive plural of &#x27;priest&#x27;) and (&#x27;homestead&#x27;), and thus means &#x27;the homestead of the priests&#x27;. It was recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Prestetone&quot;. Unlike similarly derived names in England, which generally lost their penultimate syllable and became Preston, the village&#x27;s name developed a typically Welsh emphasis on the penultimate syllable and a modification of &#x27;ton&#x27; to &#x27;tyn&#x27;, as also happened at Mostyn.

==History==
===Prehistory===
There is evidence that the current town location has been occupied since prehistoric times. Prehistoric tools found in the caves of Graig Fawr, in the nearby village of Meliden, have revealed the existence of early human habitation in the area.

===Roman===
Among a housing estate in the north of the town, there is a Roman bathhouse which may have been part of a fort on the road from Chester to Caernarfon. It was probably built by the Twentieth Legion around 120, and expanded around 150, as shown by stamped tiles with either the legion&#x27;s name, or its boar insignia. Its cold plunge-bath was fed by a wooden aqueduct channel, while, nearby, the traces of timber buildings, as well as three bronze-smiths&#x27; workshops, have been found. The bathhouse was found in 1934, and when the housing estate was built in 1984, it was excavated and preserved. However, much of the rest of Roman Prestatyn has been destroyed as houses have been built over unexcavated land, so that the &quot;Prestatyn Roman Bathhouse&quot; is the only visible remnant of it.

===Medieval===
Prestatyn was included in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; since it was at that time under English control. An earth mound, visible in fields to the east of the railway station, beyond Nant Hall, marks the site of an early wooden Prestatyn castle, probably built by the Norman Robert de Banastre about 1157, which was destroyed by the Welsh under Owain Gwynedd in 1167. The Banastre family then moved to Bank Hall in Lancashire.

The town appears to have been primarily a fishing village for hundreds of years. The beginning and end of High Street today mark the location of two &#x27;maenolau&#x27; (or manor houses) called Pendre (translated as &quot;end of&quot; or &quot;top of town&quot;) and Penisadre (&quot;lower end of town&quot;).

===19th century to present===
The town&#x27;s population remained at less than 1,000 until the arrival of the railways and the holidaymakers in the 19th and 20th centuries. &quot;Sunny Prestatyn&quot; became famous for its beach, clean seas and promenade entertainers, and visiting for a bathe was considered very healthy by city-dwelling Victorians. During the Second World War the holiday camps were used as billets for British soldiers, many of whom were also sent to live with locals.

Prestatyn was the home of the first UK Kwik Save supermarket in 1965; Prestatyn was also the home of the firm&#x27;s business headquarters. The Kwik Save store was renamed Somerfield following a takeover in 2007, and was finally demolished in 2008 when surrounding land was bought by Tesco.

The North Hoyle Offshore Wind Farm was opened in 2003. Situated in Liverpool Bay, 5 miles (8 km) off the coast of Prestatyn, it was the UK&#x27;s first major offshore wind farm. It has 30 wind turbines with a combined maximum capacity of 60 megawatts – enough to power 40,000 homes.

==Facilities and attractions==
Although Prestatyn remains a tourist destination and resort town, the town is diversifying in response to the decline of the British seaside holiday.

The town is at the northern end of the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path, although not on Offa&#x27;s Dyke itself. It also marks the eastern end of the North Wales Path, a long-distance coastal route to Bangor, and the western end of the Clwydian Way. Other attractions include the remains of Roman baths and the nearby Neolithic mound, the Gop.

Pontin&#x27;s Holiday Centre was the location for a 1973 film of the popular British TV series, &quot;On the Buses&quot;.

=== Nova ===
Previously named the Lido, this leisure and entertainment complex was established in 1923 with an outdoor seawater swimming pool and ballroom. A £4.4 million pound investment in 2015 has seen the redevelopment of this complex to include a new facade, entrance and reception area as well as a new bar/restaurant, 60 station fitness suite and children&#x27;s soft play area.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering Prestatyn, at community (town) and county level: Prestatyn Town Council and Denbighshire County Council. The town council is based at 7 Nant Hall Road.

For elections to Denbighshire County Council the town is divided into five electoral wards, namely Prestatyn Central, Prestatyn East, Prestatyn Meliden, Prestatyn North and Prestatyn South West. For elections to Prestatyn Town Council the town is divided into six wards (with Prestatyn North county ward being subdivided into North and North West). Eighteen town councillors are elected.

The town was in the Delyn parliamentary constituency from 1983 to 1997, since when it has been in Vale of Clwyd.

===Administrative history===

Prestatyn was formerly part of the ancient parish of Meliden (also called Meliden with Prestatyn) in the historic county of Flintshire. When elected parish and district councils were established in 1894 Meliden was given a parish council and included in the St Asaph Rural District. A separate urban district called Prestatyn was created from part of Meliden parish in 1896. The urban district council built itself a headquarters on Nant Hall Road in 1903. Prestatyn Urban District was abolished in 1974, with its area becoming a community instead. District-level functions passed to Rhuddlan Borough Council, which was in turn replaced by Denbighshire County Council in 1996.

==Transport==
Prestatyn railway station is on the North Wales Coast Line which connects the town with Holyhead to the west and Chester to the east.

Bus services are provided by Arriva Buses Wales.

==Annual events==
===Flower Show===
Prestatyn Flower Show is an annual event held in Prestatyn town centre on the last Friday and Saturday of July. The flower show has traditionally been held within the grounds of Cerrig Llwydion, High Street, Prestatyn, which was formerly a vicarage. The event also includes a small display of classic cars and vintage motorcycles on Saturday.

===Carnival===
Prestatyn Carnival is an annual summer event in the town, and features field events, competitions and a procession. Each year, thousands take part in the festivities. The carnival celebrated its diamond jubilee in 2011.

The traditional Carnival Parade takes place on the Saturday, and is followed by a Carnival Baby Competition later in the day. In 2008 the carnival became a two-day event, with the Sunday designated &quot;Fun on the Field&quot; day, with many events including a talent show and dance competition. In 2011 the event reverted to its original one–day format.

In 2008, Prestatyn Carnival Association revived the &#x27;Miss Prestatyn&#x27; title.

=== Classic Car Show ===
The largest free classic car show in North Wales with over 400 vehicles taking part in 2019. The show is an annual event taking place on the last Bank Holiday Monday in May since 2000. It usually takes place on Ty Nant car park in Prestatyn town centre, but expanded in 2019 to include the majority of the High Street. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a virtual show.

==Cultural references==
Philip Larkin wrote a poem entitled &#x27;Sunny Prestatyn&#x27;. In it he describes a poster advertising the resort that is progressively defaced by vulgar graffiti. Roddy Frame and Jeremy Stacey wrote most of Aztec Camera&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Frestonia&quot; during a three-week retreat at the Sands Hotel in Prestatyn. Frame later blamed the overcast and grim weather conditions there for the album&#x27;s melancholy and gloomy tone.

The town also appears in &quot;The Royle Family&quot; 2009 Christmas special &quot;The Golden Egg Cup&quot;, in which the family visits Prestatyn to celebrate Jim and Barb&#x27;s fiftieth wedding anniversary.

==Sport==
The town is host to two major football teams within the Welsh football league pyramid, Prestatyn Town and the recently formed Prestatyn Sports.

Local football side Prestatyn Town gained promotion to the Welsh Premier League having been crowned champions of the Cymru Alliance League 2007-08 season. As of 23 April 2008, planning permission for floodlights and seating had been granted in order to meet the Welsh Premier grading requirements. The deadline for these upgrades was 1 May 2008 and, having passed these requirements, their promotion was ratified by the Welsh Premier League on 15 May. They currently play in the Cymru North, the second tier of Welsh football.

Many qualification rounds in snooker were once held at Pontin&#x27;s Holiday Camp here; this included all the major snooker tournaments, and the World Championship. The qualification rounds have since moved to the World Snooker Academy in Sheffield.

Founded in 1895, Prestatyn Cricket Club has recently celebrated its 125th anniversary. As of 1 November 2020 they play in Liverpool and District Comp (LDDC) 1st XI division.

After not playing during the 1988 season, the team returned for the 1989 season as the Maryland Commandos. Following the 1989 season, the Commandos moved to Fairfax, Virginia, where they once again became known as the Washington Commandos. The team never achieved much success at either of its locations, winning four games in three seasons, including a winless 1989 season.

==History==

===Inaugural season (1987)===

The Commandos had the honor of playing in the first AFL regular season game on June 19, 1987, losing to the Pittsburgh Gladiators 48–46 at the Civic Arena. The Commandos picked up their first win in franchise history the following week, when they defeated the Denver Dynamite, by a score of 36–20 in their home opener. The Commandos finished the season with a 2–4 record, a disappointment, but the team was in every game except one, losing three games by a total of six points.

===Move to Maryland (1989)===

After a one-year hiatus, the Commandos returned to play in 1989 and operated as the &quot;Maryland Commandos&quot;, playing their only home game that year at the same venue as in 1987, Landover&#x27;s Capital Centre. The team went 0–4 in the abbreviated &#x27;travelin&#x27; season of 1989. The Commandos coaching staff consisted of Ray Willsey, Mike Hohensee, Mike Dailey, and Jerry Kurz. Hohensee, Dailey, and Kurz would all become members of the Arena Football Hall of Fame.

===Return to Virginia (1990)===

The team returned to the Washington name for their final season in 1990. They were coached by Hohensee, who had been promoted from his assistant position. The Commandos started the season 0–3.

In 1987 and 1989, the team played its home games at the Capital Centre (later known as USAir Arena) in Landover, Maryland. For the 1990 season, the team was based at the Patriot Center on the campus of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.

==Return of the AFL in Washington==
In 1999, Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder announced that he would bring an expansion team to DC to be called the Washington Warriors. (At the time, there was speculation in the media that Snyder actually wanted to change the name of the Redskins to the Warriors, due to the controversy over the NFL&#x27;s team monicker.) But after a ten-year wait and the AFL&#x27;s canceling its season in 2009, that never materialized.

In 2016, it was announced that Ted Leonsis of Monumental Sports, owner of the NBA&#x27;s Washington Wizards, WNBA&#x27;s Washington Mystics and the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals was launching an expansion franchise that would play at the Verizon Center in Washington, DC in 2017. The Washington Valor played from 2017 until 2019, when the league was suspended.

<doc id="620134" wikidata="Q1055379" url="?curid=620134" title="Non-measurable set">
<text>In mathematics, a non-measurable set is a set which cannot be assigned a meaningful &quot;volume&quot;. The existence of such sets is construed to provide information about the notions of length, area and volume in formal set theory. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the axiom of choice entails that non-measurable subsets of formula_1 exist.

The notion of a non-measurable set has been a source of great controversy since its introduction. Historically, this led Borel and Kolmogorov to formulate probability theory on sets which are constrained to be measurable. The measurable sets on the line are iterated countable unions and intersections of intervals (called Borel sets) plus-minus null sets. These sets are rich enough to include every conceivable definition of a set that arises in standard mathematics, but they require a lot of formalism to prove that sets are measurable.

In 1970, Robert M. Solovay constructed the Solovay model, which shows that it is consistent with standard set theory without uncountable choice, that all subsets of the reals are measurable. However, Solovay&#x27;s result depends on the existence of an inaccessible cardinal, whose existence and consistency cannot be proved within standard set theory.

==Historical constructions==
The first indication that there might be a problem in defining length for an arbitrary set came from Vitali&#x27;s theorem. A more recent combinatorial construction which is similar to the construction by Robin Thomas of a non-Lebesgue measurable set with some additional properties appeared in American Mathematical Monthly.

One would expect the measure of the union of two disjoint sets to be the sum of the measure of the two sets. A measure with this natural property is called &quot;finitely additive&quot;. While a finitely additive measure is sufficient for most intuition of area, and is analogous to Riemann integration, it is considered insufficient for probability, because conventional modern treatments of sequences of events or random variables demand countable additivity.

In this respect, the plane is similar to the line; there is a finitely additive measure, extending Lebesgue measure, which is invariant under all isometries. For higher dimensions the picture gets worse. The Hausdorff paradox and Banach–Tarski paradox show that a three-dimensional ball of radius 1 can be dissected into 5 parts which can be reassembled to form two balls of radius 1.

==Example==
Consider formula_2 the set of all points in the unit circle, and the action on formula_3 by a group formula_4 consisting of all rational rotations (rotations by angles which are rational multiples of formula_5). Here formula_4 is countable (more specifically, formula_4 is isomorphic to formula_8) while formula_3 is uncountable. Hence formula_3 breaks up into uncountably many orbits under formula_4 (the orbit of formula_12 is the countable set formula_13). Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset formula_14 with the property that all of the rational translates (translated copies of the form formula_15 for some rational formula_16) of formula_17 by formula_4 are pairwise disjoint (meaning, disjoint from formula_17 and from each other). The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent (by rational rotations). The set formula_17 will be non-measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive probability measure on formula_3: if formula_17 has zero measure, countable additivity would imply that the whole circle has zero measure. If formula_17 has positive measure, countable additivity would show that the circle has infinite measure.

==Consistent definitions of measure and probability==
The Banach–Tarski paradox shows that there is no way to define volume in three dimensions unless one of the following five concessions is made:
# The volume of a set might change when it is rotated.
# The volume of the union of two disjoint sets might be different from the sum of their volumes.
# Some sets might be tagged &quot;non-measurable&quot;, and one would need to check whether a set is &quot;measurable&quot; before talking about its volume.
# The axioms of ZFC (Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice) might have to be altered.
# The volume of formula_24 is formula_25 or formula_26.

Standard measure theory takes the third option. One defines a family of measurable sets, which is very rich, and almost any set explicitly defined in most branches of mathematics will be among this family. It is usually very easy to prove that a given specific subset of the geometric plane is measurable. The fundamental assumption is that a countably infinite sequence of disjoint sets satisfies the sum formula, a property called σ-additivity.

In 1970, Solovay demonstrated that the existence of a non-measurable set for the Lebesgue measure is not provable within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in the absence of an additional axiom (such as the axiom of choice), by showing that (assuming the consistency of an inaccessible cardinal) there is a model of ZF, called Solovay&#x27;s model, in which countable choice holds, every set is Lebesgue measurable and in which the full axiom of choice fails.

The axiom of choice is equivalent to a fundamental result of point-set topology, Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem, and also to the conjunction of two fundamental results of functional analysis, the Banach–Alaoglu theorem and the Krein–Milman theorem. It also affects the study of infinite groups to a large extent, as well as ring and order theory (see Boolean prime ideal theorem). However, the axioms of determinacy and dependent choice together are sufficient for most geometric measure theory, potential theory, Fourier series and Fourier transforms, while making all subsets of the real line Lebesgue-measurable.

<doc id="620138" wikidata="Q1807193" url="?curid=620138" title="Rhuddlan">
<text>Rhuddlan () is a town, community, and electoral ward in Denbighshire, Wales. Its associated urban zone is mainly on the right bank of the Clwyd; it is directly south of seafront town Rhyl. It gave its name to the Welsh district of Rhuddlan from 1974 to 1996. As of the 2001 census, the population was 4,296 decreasing to 3,709 in the 2011 census. It was historically in Flintshire.

== Etymology ==
The name of the town is a combination of the Welsh words &#x27; &quot;red&quot; + &#x27; &quot;riverbank&quot;.

==History==
In AD 921, the Anglo-Saxon king, Edward the Elder, founded a burh named (mouth of the Clwydd) at Rhuddlan. In the following century, before the Norman Conquest and subsequent Norman occupation of lower Gwynedd, the Perfeddwlad, Rhuddlan was the site of a Welsh cantref and served as the seat of government and capital of Gwynedd for the Welsh king Gruffydd ap Llywelyn (ruled 1055–1063). Following the Conquest, in 1086, Rhuddlan was recorded in the Domesday Book as a small settlement within the hundred of Ati&#x27;s Cross and in the county of Cheshire.

A mint established at Rhuddlan in the 1180s by Dafydd ab Owain, and later maintained by Llywelyn the Great, was responsible for minting the first native Welsh coinage since the reign of Hywel Dda.

The town is known for the ruins of Rhuddlan Castle, built by order of King Edward I from 1277 to 1282, and for the site of another castle at Twthill, built by the Norman Robert of Rhuddlan about 1072. Well-preserved Rhuddlan castle has a great round tower and many surviving walls. It was built soon after the conquest of Wales.

The town was thus where Edward I signed the Statute of Rhuddlan, laying down the way by which the Principality of Wales, created by the princes of Gwynedd, was to be governed.

The town&#x27;s first Welsh chapel, now 17 Cross Street, was built in 1771.

The hymn tune &quot;Rhuddlan&quot; was brought to wider prominence by Ralph Vaughan Williams as music editor of the first edition of The English Hymnal in 1906, and it has since been adopted by numerous other hymnals. It is usually sung to the words of the hymns &quot;Judge eternal, throned in splendour&quot; and, more recently, &quot;For the healing of the nations&quot;.

Rhuddlan railway station was part of the Vale of Clwyd Railway. The station closed in 1955 but the line remained open until 1968. The station was demolished around 1977 and a Premier Inn hotel now occupies the site.

In 2001, the A525 bypass was completed, easing access to Rhyl. Since 2001 the centre of Rhuddlan has been largely redeveloped.

=== Archaeology ===
In 2021 February, archaeologists from Aeon Archaeology announced the discovery of more than 300 stone age tools and artefacts in Rhuddlan. They revealed scrapers, microliths, flakes of chert (hard, sedimentary rock), flints and even rudimentary tools. Expert Richard Cooke believes that the remains were belong to people who was passing through and made camp by the river more than 9,000 years ago.

<text>Under the Chatham House Rule, anyone who comes to a meeting is free to use information from the discussion, but is not allowed to reveal who made any particular comment. It is designed to increase openness of discussion. The rule is a system for holding debates and discussion panels on controversial topics, named after the London headquarters of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, where the rule originated in June 1927.

==The rule==
The rule was created in 1927 and refined in 1992. Since its most recent refinement in 2002, the rule states:

Although sometimes referred to as &quot;Chatham House Rules&quot;, Chatham House states that the singular should be used as there is only one rule.

==Purpose==
The rule aims to foster open dialogue on public policy and current affairs. It enables individuals to express and debate controversial opinions without risking their professional standing and establishes a clear distinction between personal views and those of their employer.

The original rule of 1927 was refined in October 1992 and again in 2002. Chatham House has translated the rule into Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

==Use==
===European Central Bank===
The European Central Bank (ECB) sometimes adopts the Chatham House Rule. In May 2015, release of a speech, which adhered to the rule, by ECB board member Benoît Cœuré caused divided opinion as to its use and his self-publication. The Cœuré speech affected currency, and stock and bond markets. Thereafter, ECB invocations of the rule for a question-and-answer session and opening remarks for Cœuré, respectively, by Vice President Vítor Constâncio and fellow board member Peter Praet, gained attention. An ECB governing council member Boštjan Jazbec also had, the same month, convened questions-and-answers, under the rule.

===Bilderberg Group===
The Bilderberg Group uses the Chatham House Rule for its annual conferences, which feature between 120 and 150 prominent politicians, CEOs, national security experts, academics, and journalists invited by the group&#x27;s steering committee. The practice has been criticized by some commentators, who view the conferences as a means for policymakers to make decisions without public accountability.

<text>Capel Curig (; meaning &quot;Curig&#x27;s Chapel&quot;) is a village and community in Conwy County Borough, Wales. Historically in Caernarfonshire, it lies in the heart of Snowdonia, on the River Llugwy, and has a population of 226, reducing slightly to 206 at the 2011 census. It lies at the junction of the A5 road from Bangor and Bethesda to Betws-y-Coed with the A4086 road from Caernarfon, Llanberis, Pen-y-Pass and Pen-y-Gwryd. It is surrounded by hills and mountains, including Moel Siabod and Pen Llithrig y Wrach.

==Name==
Capel Curig takes its name from the little St Julitta&#x27;s Church in the ancient graveyard by the river bridge on the Llanberis road. This, confusingly, has been known for over 100 years as St Julitta&#x27;s Church, and is currently being restored by the &quot;Friends of Saint Julitta&quot;. Tradition claims this chapel to be the 6th-century foundation of St Curig, a Celtic bishop. Centuries later, probably when the present ancient church was built, the name appears to have been Latinised as , which is the name of a 4th-century child martyr whose mother was Julitta. They are usually named together as &quot;Saints Quiricus and Julietta&quot;.

The names &quot;Capel Kiryg&quot; and &quot;Capel Kerig&quot; were recorded in 1536 and 1578 respectively.

==Roman fort==
Approximately one kilometre from Pont Cyfyng, on the farm of Bryn Gefeiliau, there are the remains of a Roman fort (&quot;c&quot;.90–100 AD) and named Caer Llugwy by its excavators. (, OS Grid Reference SH746572). In 1920 excavations undertaken by J.P. Hall and Captain G.H. Hodgson revealed a roughly square Roman fort of approximately . Stone buildings were uncovered and traced. The rectangular walled area is on flat land close to the River Llugwy. From the pottery and finds in 1923 and subsequently, it appears to have only been garrisoned for 20–30 years.

==Activity centre==
