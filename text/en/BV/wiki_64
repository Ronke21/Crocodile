<text>The Farewell Dossier was the collection of documents that Colonel Vladimir Vetrov, a KGB defector &quot;en place&quot; (code-named &quot;Farewell&quot;), gathered and gave to the Direction de la surveillance du territoire (DST) in 1981–82, during the Cold War.

Vetrov was an engineer who had been assigned to evaluate information on NATO hardware and software gathered by the &quot;Line X&quot; technical intelligence operation for Directorate T, the Soviet Union directorate for scientific and technical intelligence collection from the West. He became increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet system and decided to work with the French at the end of the 1970s. Between early 1981 and early 1982, Vetrov gave almost 4,000 secret documents to the DST, including the complete list of 250 Line X officers stationed under legal cover in embassies around the world.

As a consequence, Western nations undertook a mass expulsion of Soviet technology spies. 

Vetrov&#x27;s story inspired the 1997 book &quot;Bonjour Farewell: La Vérité sur la Taupe Française du KGB&quot; by Serguei Kostine. It was adapted in the French film &quot;L&#x27;affaire Farewell&quot; (2009) starring Emir Kusturica and Guillaume Canet.

==Background==
Vetrov was a 52-year-old engineer assigned to evaluate the intelligence on capitalist hardware and software collected by spies (&quot;Line X&quot;) for Directorate T. He became disillusioned, and at the end of 1980 volunteered his services to France for ideological reasons. French intelligence gave him the codename &quot;Farewell&quot; — an English word so that the KGB would assume he worked for the CIA if they learned of the code-name.

Between early 1981 and early 1982, Farewell supplied the DST with about four thousand secret documents, including a list of Soviet organizations in scientific collection and summary reports from Directorate T on the goals, achievements, and unfulfilled objectives of the program. He revealed the names of more than 200 Line X officers stationed in 10 KGB residences in the West, along with more than 100 leads to Line X recruitments.

In a private meeting on 19 July 1981, at the Ottawa Summit, French president François Mitterrand made President Ronald Reagan aware of Farewell and offered the intelligence to the United States.

William Safire said Mitterrand described the man as belonging to a section that was evaluating the achievements of Soviet efforts to acquire NATO technology. Reagan expressed great interest in Mitterrand&#x27;s revelations and thanked him for having the material sent to the United States government. It was passed through Vice President Bush and then to William Casey, his Director of Central Intelligence. Casey called in Gus W. Weiss, then working with Thomas C. Reed on the staff of the National Security Council. After studying the list of hundreds of Soviet agents and purchasers (including one cosmonaut) assigned to this penetration in the US and Japan, Weiss counselled against deportation.

The dossier, under the name of Farewell, reached the CIA in August 1981. It demonstrated that the Soviets had spent years carrying out their espionage of research and development activities.

==CIA response==
While Vetrov was recruited by the French, the Western counter-reaction came from the US.

Safire was writing a series of hardline columns denouncing the financial backing being given to Moscow by Germany and Britain for the Trans-Siberian Pipeline, a major natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Europe. That project would give control of European energy supplies to the Communists, as well as generate US$8 billion a year to support Soviet computer and satellite research.

The CIA mounted a counter-intelligence operation that transferred modified hardware and software designs over to the Soviets. They instigated an operation of disinformation and faulty technology transfer. Thomas C. Reed alleged this was the cause of a trans-Siberian pipeline disaster in 1982.

Information from Vetrov also led to the arrest in New York of the spy Dieter Gerhardt, a South African naval officer who had been passing secrets to the Soviets for 20 years. His handler, Vitaly Shlykov, was arrested and subsequently imprisoned in Switzerland while attempting to meet with Gerhardt&#x27;s wife, Ruth, who was acting as his courier.

===Counterintelligence response===
According to Reed, another result was that the United States and its NATO allies later &quot;rolled up the entire Line X collection network, both in the US and overseas.&quot; Weiss said &quot;the heart of Soviet technology collection crumbled and would not recover&quot;.

==Discovery==
Eventually, Vetrov&#x27;s defection led to his death. &quot;Vetrov fell into a tragic episode with a woman and a fellow KGB officer in a Moscow park. In circumstances that are not clear, he stabbed and killed the officer and then stabbed but did not kill the woman. He was arrested, and, in the ensuing investigation, his espionage activities were discovered; he was eventually executed in 1985. CIA had enough intelligence to institute protective countermeasures.&quot;

By 1985 Mitterrand came to suspect that Vetrov had been a CIA plant set up to test him after his election in 1981 to see if the material would be handed over to the Americans or kept by the French. Acting on this mistaken belief, Mitterrand fired the chief of the French service, Yves Bonnet. The details of the operation were declassified in 1996.

== Reception ==
First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba Fidel Castro wrote in a 2007 article that the campaign of countermeasures based on Farewell&#x27;s dossier was an economic war; that although there were no deaths in the gas pipeline explosion, the Soviet economy was significantly damaged; and that between 1984 and 1985, the United States and its NATO allies had put an end to the technology spying operation, which had destroyed the capacity of the USSR to capture technology when Moscow was caught between a defective economy on one hand and a US President determined to prevail and end the Cold War on the other.

<text>Duncan Phyfe (1768 – 16 August 1854) was one of nineteenth-century America&#x27;s leading cabinetmakers.

Rather than create a new furniture style, he interpreted fashionable European trends in a manner so distinguished and particular that he became a major spokesman for Neoclassicism in the United States, influencing a generation of American cabinetmakers.

==Life and career==
Born Duncan Fife near Loch Fannich, Scotland, he immigrated with his family to Albany, New York, in 1784 and served as a cabinetmaker’s apprentice.

In 1791 he moved to New York City and one year later is documented the earliest mention of him in the city, when he was elected to the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen, sponsored by Isaac Nichols and Seabury Champlin, either of whom may have trained him. 

By the time of his marriage in 1793, he appears in the New York directories as a &quot;joiner,&quot; but by 1794 he called himself &quot;cabinetmaker&quot; and had changed the spelling of his name to Phyfe. He opened his own business in 1794 and was listed as a cabinetmaker in the &quot;New-York Directory and Register.&quot; From his first shop on 2 Broad Street, he later moved to Partition Street (later renamed Fulton Street in 1817 in honor of Robert Fulton), where he stayed for the rest of his life.

A poor immigrant when he arrived in America from his native Scotland, Phyfe acquired wealth and fame through hard work, exceptional talent and the support of patrons. He would come to count among his clients some of the nation&#x27;s wealthiest and most storied families. Throughout the first half of the nineteenth century he made Neoclassical furniture for the social and mercantile elite of New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the American South where he was particularly popular. Known during his lifetime as the &quot;United States Rage&quot;, to this day remains America&#x27;s best-known cabinetmaker, establishing his reputation as a purveyor of luxury by designing high-quality furniture.

His personal style, characterized by superior proportions, balance, symmetry, and restraint, became the New York local style. Many apprentices and journeymen exposed to this distinctive style by serving a stint in the Phyfe shop or by copying the master cabinetmaker&#x27;s designs helped to create and sustain this local school of cabinetmaking. Demand for Phyfe&#x27;s work reached its peak between 1805 and 1820, although he remained a dominant figure in the trade until 1847, when he retired at the age of seventy-seven. Within the short span of a single generation, however, the work of the master was all but forgotten until the revival in the 1920s, when different furniture companies replicated his designs for several decades.

He became known as one of America&#x27;s leading cabinetmakers by selling furniture at relatively low prices. Phyfe’s work encompassed a broad range of the period’s Neoclassical styles, starting from his earliest furniture— which bear the influence of his 18th-century British predecessors Thomas Sheraton and Thomas Hope— continuing with Regency, Federal, Empire and ending with his late simplified designs in the Grecian plain style.
Between 1837 and 1847, Duncan Phyfe took his two sons, Michael and James, as business partners and the firm went under the names D. Phyfe &amp; Sons (1837–1840) and after Michael&#x27;s premature death, D. Phyfe &amp; Son (1840–1847). It was during the latter and final stages of the business’s history that perhaps the greatest challenge Phyfe ever faced emerged; how to cope with the new wave of historical revival styles. In 1840, one Southern planter who came to New York from Columbia, South Carolina, observed to his wife in a letter that the Phyfes were &quot;as much behind the times in style as (they were) in price.&quot; Because the Phyfes always adhered to the classicist language, they never fully engaged with the emerging historical revival styles (e.g. Gothic, Rococo, Renaissance etc.) that began about this time.

Duncan Phyfe and his son James closed the family business in 1847 after fifty-five years in the trade. They held an auction of the remaining contents of their furniture warehouse. The auctioneer was Halliday &amp; Jenkins.

Because Phyfe&#x27;s furniture was seldom signed, yet widely imitated, it is sometimes difficult to determine with accuracy which works he actually made. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.

==Major exhibitions and collections==
On 15 October 1922, the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened to the public &quot;Furniture from the Workshop of Duncan Phyfe&quot;, the first exhibition ever held in an art museum on the work of a single cabinetmaker. Ninety years later and only for the second time in history, a major retrospective on this iconic American craftsman and his furniture was again on view from 20 December 2011 – 6 May 2012, under the title &quot;Duncan Phyfe: Master Cabinetmaker in New York&quot;.

Another exhibition took place at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston from 24 June – 9 September 2012.

Duncan Phyfe&#x27;s furniture can be admired in the White House Green Room, Edgewater, Roper House and especially at Millford Plantation, owned by the Classical American Homes Preservation Trust. His furniture appears in many museums and private collections as well.

==In popular culture==
Phyfe’s artistry has continued to resonate with collectors and creative communities throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. This can be seen through popular culture references to his craftsmanship, the high esteem in which it is held, and the cultural cachet it confers. Examples of such references include the following:

Karl Shapiro refers to the fly&#x27;s leg as &quot;the fine leg of a Duncan-Phyfe,&quot; in his poem &quot;The Fly&quot;.

Likewise, in one of the passages of the novel &quot;Tender is the Night&quot; by F. Scott Fitzgerald, he wrote: &quot;She wept all over a set that cost a fortune, in a Duncan Phyfe dining-room...&quot;.

Similarly, in her novel &quot;Jazz&quot;, Toni Morrison refers to Phyfe: “after they’d eaten they rolled cigarettes and settled down on the curb as though it were a Duncan Phyfe.”

In the Summer episode of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Rory notes that Emily&#x27;s living room table is a Duncan Phyfe.

In the episode A Plaque for Mayberry on The Andy Griffith Show, the character Barney Fife thinks he is related to Duncan Phyfe.

Fran Lebowitz references his artistry as a fine companion for anyone in her piece “Pointers for Pets” from her collection &quot;Social Studies&quot; (1981): “Georgian silver and Duncan Phyfe sofas make wonderful companions, as do all alcoholic beverages and out-of-season fruits.”

One of the world&#x27;s largest roadside attractions is a giant chair located in Thomasville, North Carolina. The monument was erected in 1950, and the plaque located on its pedestal reads: &quot;This chair is an exemplar and inspiration for future generations to emulate and perpetuate the achievements of our time-honored furniture designers and craftsmen. ... The original chair was the creation of the famous American designer Duncan Phyfe&quot;.

Some years later, another replica of a Phyfe model chair was built in 1959 in Washington, DC.

<text>Michael John Cloete Crawford Rutherford (born 2 October 1950) is an English guitarist, bassist and songwriter, best known as co-founder, lead guitarist and bassist of the rock band Genesis. He and keyboardist Tony Banks are the group&#x27;s two continuous members.

Initially serving as Genesis&#x27;s bass guitarist and backing vocalist, Rutherford also performed most of the band&#x27;s rhythm guitar parts—frequently on twelve-string guitar—in collaboration with successive Genesis lead guitarists Anthony Phillips and Steve Hackett. Following Hackett&#x27;s departure from Genesis in 1977, Rutherford assumed the additional role of lead guitarist on the band&#x27;s studio albums (beginning with &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot; in 1978). Rutherford was one of the main Genesis songwriters throughout their career and wrote the lyrics for some of the band&#x27;s biggest international hits, such as &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;, &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;, &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; and &quot;Throwing It All Away&quot;. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010.

In addition to his work with Genesis, Rutherford released two solo albums in the early 1980s. In 1985, he formed Mike + the Mechanics, which became a chart-topping act and significant live draw in its own right. The group earned Rutherford an Ivor Novello Award for the 1988 single &quot;The Living Years&quot;, as well as two Grammys.

==Early life==
Michael John Cloete Crawford Rutherford was born on 2 October 1950 in Chertsey, Surrey. His father, William Francis Henry Crawford Rutherford (1906-1986) was a Royal Navy Captain (awarded the DSO and CBE) who became a manager in industry (including for aircraft manufacturer Hawker Siddeley) upon his retirement from the service and married his mother Anne. He has an elder sister, Nicolette.

Rutherford received his first guitar at the age of 8, and played in his first band, The Chesters, so named because by then they lived near Chester, in the following year. He attended The Leas, a preparatory school in Hoylake, Merseyside before he moved to Charterhouse, a private school in Godalming, Surrey in September 1964. He co-formed the school band Anon (short for Anonymous) with guitarist Anthony Phillips in 1965, but was forced to leave the band when his housemaster banned him from playing guitar. After Rutherford got the ban lifted, he played with a band called Climax and was later reinstated into Anon. When the lead vocalist and bassist of Anon both quit, Rutherford switched to bass and lead vocals for a time. Anon played one last concert in this trio configuration in December 1966, after which they split and Rutherford and Phillips started writing songs together during the Christmas holiday. They formed Genesis in 1967 with fellow Charterhouse pupils, keyboardist Tony Banks, vocalist Peter Gabriel, and drummer Chris Stewart. Rutherford disliked his time at Charterhouse, and was expelled for instances of minor misconduct.

==Playing style==

Rutherford&#x27;s playing style has been shaped by his unorthodox performance requirements within Genesis, where frequent shifts between instruments (or shifts of role between instruments) were common. Though his work with bass and guitar has been praised by some critics, he has described his playing as average and said that he considers himself a songwriter first and foremost.

Rutherford&#x27;s bass guitar playing initially involved the use of a pick and a high-treble setting. He would also employ a relatively harsh, horn-like distortion setting to differentiate the instrument&#x27;s tone from the rest of the ensemble. In the mid-1970s he would begin to play fretless bass guitar on Genesis songs (in particular on ballads) and would experiment with 8-string bass guitar.

Rutherford&#x27;s rhythm guitar playing was initially characterised by his use of electric and acoustic 12-string guitars. A distinctive sound of early Genesis recordings was Rutherford&#x27;s double acoustic 12-string playing intertwined with that of Anthony Phillips or, later, Steve Hackett (keyboard player Tony Banks would occasionally also play 12-string guitar parts to make up a duo or trio). As a rhythm guitar player and writer, Rutherford has favoured melodic, minimalist chords or progressions of single notes, as in the Genesis songs &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot;, &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; and &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, or the Mike and the Mechanics song &quot;The Living Years&quot;.

Rutherford assumed lead guitar duties for Genesis in 1977 after Hackett left the band. Previously he had made occasional lead guitar contributions to Genesis music if they were best played by him (such as the electric sitar parts on &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;), but following the departure of Hackett and the band&#x27;s decision not to replace him with a new guitarist, despite toying with auditioning new guitarists or using a studio guitarist on &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;, Rutherford assumed all guitarist roles in the recording studio, having felt confident enough to double up on lead guitar as well as bass. As a lead player he has favoured long, melodic tones, bending the notes into plaintive, almost vocal lines. This results in &quot;singable&quot; solos or the creation of sonic atmospheres rather than showy displays of technical prowess. Post-Hackett, he has also diversified his rhythm guitar approach beyond his initial twelve-string-based approach.

Following the departure of Anthony Phillips, for a time Genesis performed without a dedicated guitarist, so Rutherford had to play all the guitar parts, using bass pedals to simultaneously cover the bass. Rutherford found that he liked this configuration, and following the recruitment of Steve Hackett he continued to play bass pedals both live and in the studio, often playing simultaneous twelve-string guitar and bass pedal parts in order to cover rhythm and bass parts at the same time. Initially using a Dewtron &quot;Mister Bassman&quot; bass pedal synthesiser, he had moved onto Moog Taurus bass pedals by the 1976 &quot;Trick of the Tail&quot; Tour. Frequently Rutherford&#x27;s bass guitar, 12-string guitar, and bass pedal playing have featured in different sections of a single Genesis song, &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; and &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; being good examples of this. Sometimes Rutherford&#x27;s bass pedals are used to set up a steady drone as the basis for an individual song (such as &quot;Afterglow&quot;).

In concerts during the first half of the 1970s, Rutherford often played a double-necked instrument, custom built from a separate Rickenbacker hollowbody 12-string and 4001 bass. Rickenbacker later issued double neck bass/guitar combinations with 4080/6 and 4080/12 models. However, Rutherford assigned the guitar neck to the top position rather than the 4080&#x27;s stock guitar on bottom. He later had a custom Shergold double-neck made, with the body modified so that each neck could be detached and played as a standard single-neck instrument, or swapped out in favour of alternate halves (allowing the 12-string half to be switched to a 6-string when needed). On post-1977 Genesis live shows, Rutherford would alternate parts with touring band member Daryl Stuermer. Stuermer would typically play all of Hackett&#x27;s original guitar parts (while Rutherford concentrated on bass, twelve-string guitar and pedals), but play bass guitar on most songs from the post-Hackett era (for which Rutherford would move to guitar).

Rutherford also contributed other instrumental work to Genesis, performing occasional cello parts on their early 1970s records and playing the drumkit on live performances of the song &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; in 1981.

==With Genesis==
According to Anthony Phillips, Rutherford did very little songwriting on Genesis&#x27;s debut album, &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;, and it was with their second album, &quot;Trespass&quot;, that he emerged as a prolific songwriter. Genesis typically wrote songs collaboratively, with Rutherford&#x27;s more well-known contributions including the transition to the electrical segments of &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, the music to the first half of &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;, and the lyrics to &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; and &quot;Turn It On Again&quot;. He also wrote a few Genesis songs by himself, including the minor hit &quot;Your Own Special Way&quot;.

==Solo work and Mike + the Mechanics==
During breaks in Genesis, Rutherford recorded two solo albums, &quot;Smallcreep&#x27;s Day&quot; and &quot;Acting Very Strange&quot;. However, he was dissatisfied with his solo work and in 1984 he resolved to never record a solo album again, since he felt his creativity was at its peak when working in collaboration. Because of this, he formed the band Mike + The Mechanics during a break from Genesis in 1985.

Mike + The Mechanics&#x27; biggest hits are &quot;All I Need Is a Miracle&quot;, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, &quot;The Living Years&quot;, &quot;Silent Running&quot; and &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot;. To help promote &quot;The Living Years&quot;, Rutherford and the record label perpetuated the impression that the song was inspired by Rutherford&#x27;s relationship with his father, who died during Genesis&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; Tour. In 2004, Rutherford confessed that the lyrics were in fact written by B. A. Robertson, and based entirely on Robertson&#x27;s relationship with his father.

Rutherford also collaborated with other artists, including associates Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins, on the &quot;Against All Odds&quot; soundtrack, offering the song &quot;Making A Big Mistake&quot;.

Rutherford played at the Strat Pack Concert in 2004 along with Brian May, David Gilmour, Joe Walsh and many other guitarists, in a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster electric guitar. Rutherford performed in the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics on 12 August 2012 as a guest member of Ed Sheeran&#x27;s band, along with Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason, playing the Pink Floyd song &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.

==Instruments==

Early in his career, Rutherford played mainly Rickenbacker and Shergold basses. He developed the idea behind the M-Series Steinberger guitar with the help of English luthier Roger Giffin and he used this extensively in the 1980s and during The Invisible Touch Tour with Genesis. He had a double-neck Strata (later renamed Status) built for the Mama tour which featured a six string guitar and four string bass placed in a custom body. In the earlier years of Genesis he played a Dewtron Mister Bassman and, starting in 1976, Moog Taurus bass pedal synthesisers.

Through the early 1970s live tours, Rutherford often used a custom built Rickenbacker double-neck that combined a 12-string semi-hollow-body guitar with a 4-string bass (now on display at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum). For The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway and the first part of the Trick of the Tail tours, he incorporated a Rickenbacker 12-string solid-body guitar and a 6-string Micro-Frets Signature Baritone, equipped with 6-string short scale bass strings. Later he switched to another 12-string solid body/6-string bass combination built from scratch. All these double-neck guitars were made by luthier Dick Knight. A custom Shergold double-neck was made that had modules for 4, 6 and 12 strings guitars. The retunings required for early Genesis songs led to the development of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s stories and introductions.

For the 2007 tour with Genesis, Rutherford continued to use double-neck instruments when the arrangements demand quick switches between bass and twelve-string guitars. His current double-neck model is a Gibson twelve-string guitar with a Yamaha TRB-4P bass while he prefers Eric Clapton signature model Fender Stratocasters when playing guitar on later pieces. As for bass, from 1992 on, Rutherford can be seen playing mostly Yamaha from the TRB series. During the 2022 The Last Domino? Tour, Rutherford started using Squier Bullet Stratocasters after purchasing a pair while under lockdown in Cape Town.

==Personal life==
Rutherford currently divides his time between Loxwood, West Sussex, England, and Cape Town, South Africa with his wife Angie. The couple were married on 13 November 1976 and have three children: Kate (b. 1977), Tom (b. 1980), and Harry (b. 1986). The family enjoys equestrian sport such as polo and dressage, in addition to raising horses.

In 2009, Philip Beresford, compiler of the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot;, estimated Rutherford&#x27;s fortune at £30 million from past touring activity, future touring income, and the Genesis back catalogue, plus other smaller company assets and accumulated earnings.

==Memoir==
In 2014, Rutherford published &quot;The Living Years: The First Genesis Memoir&quot; with Thomas Dunne Books. The first book about Rutherford&#x27;s solo career, called &quot;Silent Runner&quot; by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno) in 2011.

<text>Herfast or Arfast (died 1084) was the first Lord Chancellor of Norman England. He was also Bishop of Elmham and later Bishop of Thetford, after he moved his see there.

==Life==
Born in Normandy, Herfast joined William the Conqueror during the Norman Conquest of England and was appointed head of the royal writing office after the Battle of Hastings. He was Lord Chancellor of England from 1069 to 1070.

After serving as Lord Chancellor, he was consecrated Bishop of Elmham in 1070, but about 27 May 1072 he moved the see to Thetford, thus becoming Bishop of Thetford. He attempted to move his diocese to Bury St. Edmunds Abbey, with the assistance of Herman the Archdeacon, but the proposal was opposed by its abbot, Baldwin. Herfast finally lost in the King&#x27;s Court in 1081 and was fined a crippling amount, which was unpaid when he died.

He signed the Accord of Winchester in 1072.

Bishop Herfast died in 1084. He was a married bishop, and his sons held land in Norfolk at the time of Domesday Book in 1086.

<doc id="624033" wikidata="Q1536235" url="?curid=624033" title="Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations">
<text>The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS equations) are time-averaged
equations of motion for fluid flow. The idea behind the equations is Reynolds decomposition, whereby an instantaneous quantity is decomposed into its time-averaged and fluctuating quantities, an idea first proposed by Osborne Reynolds. The RANS equations are primarily used to describe turbulent flows. These equations can be used with approximations based on knowledge of the properties of flow turbulence to give approximate time-averaged solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations.
For a stationary flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid, these equations can be written in Einstein notation in Cartesian coordinates as:
formula_1

The left hand side of this equation represents the change in mean momentum of a fluid element owing to the unsteadiness in the mean flow and the convection by the mean flow. This change is balanced by the mean body force, the isotropic stress owing to the mean pressure field, the viscous stresses, and apparent stress formula_2 owing to the fluctuating velocity field, generally referred to as the Reynolds stress. This nonlinear Reynolds stress term requires additional modeling to close the RANS equation for solving, and has led to the creation of many different turbulence models. The time-average operator formula_3 is a Reynolds operator.

== Derivation of RANS equations ==
The basic tool required for the derivation of the RANS equations from the instantaneous Navier–Stokes equations is the Reynolds decomposition. Reynolds decomposition refers to separation of the flow variable (like velocity formula_4) into the mean (time-averaged) component (formula_5) and the fluctuating component (formula_6). Because the mean operator is a Reynolds operator, it has a set of properties. One of these properties is that the mean of the fluctuating quantity is equal to zero formula_7. Thus,
formula_8 where formula_9 is the position vector. Some authors prefer using formula_10 instead of formula_11 for the mean term (since an overbar is sometimes used to represent a vector). In this case, the fluctuating term formula_12 is represented instead by formula_4. This is possible because the two terms do not appear simultaneously in the same equation. To avoid confusion, the notation formula_14, formula_15, and formula_16 will be used to represent the instantaneous, mean, and fluctuating terms, respectively.

The properties of Reynolds operators are useful in the derivation of the RANS equations. Using these properties, the Navier–Stokes equations of motion, expressed in tensor notation, are (for an incompressible Newtonian fluid):
formula_17
formula_18
where formula_19 is a vector representing external forces.

Next, each instantaneous quantity can be split into time-averaged and fluctuating components, and the resulting equation time-averaged,
 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
formula_20

Note that the nonlinear terms (like formula_21) can be simplified to
formula_22
to yield:

formula_23
formula_24

The momentum equation can also be written as,
formula_25
On further manipulations this yields,
formula_26

where, formula_27 is the mean rate of strain tensor.

Finally, since integration in time removes the time dependence of the resultant terms, the time derivative must be eliminated, leaving:
formula_28

==Equations of Reynolds stress==
The time evolution equation of Reynolds stress is given by:
formula_29
This equation is very complicated. If formula_30 is traced, turbulence kinetic energy is obtained.
The last term formula_31 is turbulent dissipation rate. All RANS models are based on the above equation.
==Applications (RANS modelling)==
* A model for testing performance was determined that, when combined with the vortex lattice (VLM) or boundary element method (BEM), RANS was found useful for modelling the flow of water between two contrary rotation propellers, where VLM or BEM are applied to the propellers and RANS is used for the dynamically fluxing inter-propeller state.
* The RANS equations have been widely utilized as a model for determining flow characteristics and assessing wind comfort in urban environments. This computational approach can be executed through direct calculations involving the solution of the RANS equations, or through an indirect method involving the training of machine learning algorithms using the RANS equations as a basis. The direct approach is more accurate than the indirect approach but it requires expertise in numerical methods and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as well as substantial computational resources to handle the complexity of the equations.

<text>Mike and the Mechanics (stylised as Mike + The Mechanics) are an English rock supergroup formed in Dover in 1985 by Mike Rutherford, initially as a side project during a hiatus period for his other group Genesis. The band are known for the hit singles &quot;Silent Running&quot;, &quot;All I Need Is a Miracle&quot;, &quot;Taken In&quot;, &quot;The Living Years&quot;, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, and &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot;.

Initially, the band included Rutherford (the only constant member), vocalists Paul Carrack and Paul Young, keyboardist Adrian Lee, and drummer Peter Van Hooke. After a decade together, Lee and Van Hooke dropped out in 1995 and were not replaced. Following Young&#x27;s death in 2000, Carrack became the band&#x27;s sole lead vocalist until 2004 when the band (essentially a duo at this point) dissolved, with Rutherford and Carrack both agreeing the band had &quot;run its course&quot;. In 2010, the band was revived with Rutherford headlining a completely new set of musicians, including vocalists Andrew Roachford and Tim Howar.

==Biography==
===Formation and commercial breakthrough===
During hiatuses from Genesis, Mike Rutherford had been pursuing a solo career, releasing &quot;Smallcreep&#x27;s Day&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Acting Very Strange&quot; in 1982. He found the process of recording a solo album excessively difficult, however, and the results artistically unsatisfying, particularly in regards to singing lead vocals on the latter album. He recalled, &quot;I had a revelation, too, in this time period ... that I&#x27;m not complete on my own. ... I&#x27;m much more creative and inspired when there are other people around me and I&#x27;m bouncing ideas off.&quot; He still felt that working only with Genesis would leave him unfulfilled, however, and to satisfy both his desire to create music outside the format of Genesis and his desire to collaborate with other musicians, he set about forming his own band.

Rutherford had already started a songwriting partnership with Scottish singer/writer/composer B. A. Robertson, and for the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album he enlisted the services of producer Christopher Neil. Besides producing, Neil co-wrote most of the songs, selected the material for inclusion, and performed backing vocals. He would continue to play a key role in the band&#x27;s albums for their first decade of existence.

Similarly to Steely Dan or The Alan Parsons Project, in the studio Mike and the Mechanics were not a tight-knit band but a vehicle for the songwriting of Rutherford, Robertson, and Neil, and session keyboardists, drummers, guitarists, and even lead vocalists often performed on the songs in place of the official band members. Indeed, the line-up of Mike and the Mechanics came together gradually over the course of recording their first album; Paul Young, who was recommended for the group by Neil and his manager, said that by the time he joined, all the backing tracks for the album had been recorded.

Rutherford was more than satisfied with the resulting album and decided to continue the band indefinitely, rather than leaving it as a one-off project. When the album was released in 1985, his decision was further bolstered by its immense commercial success. While Rutherford&#x27;s solo albums had been moderately successful, he had never managed a Top 40 hit (except in Canada, where &quot;Maxine&quot; from &quot;Acting Very Strange&quot; reached No. 39); &quot;Mike + the Mechanics&quot; scored three of them, including two US Top 10s, &quot;Silent Running (On Dangerous Ground)&quot;, &quot;All I Need is a Miracle&quot; and an additional No. 32 hit with &quot;Taken In&quot;. &quot;Silent Running&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;On Dangerous Ground&quot;, released in North American cinemas in 1986 as &quot;Choke Canyon&quot;.

===Peak===
The single &quot;The Living Years&quot; (US#1, UK#2), released in 1988, became the band&#x27;s biggest hit, and featured on the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Living Years&quot;. The song was written by Rutherford and Robertson after both of their fathers had recently died, but the lyrics were written solely by Robertson and centred on the unresolved dissension between Robertson and his father. The song was sung by Carrack, who also had an emotional attachment to the song, having lost his own father when he was 11 years old. The album also featured the song &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, sung by Young; it served as the background music to a television advertising campaign for Tennent&#x27;s bitter.

At this point Carrack began to take a much larger role in the band, joining their stable of songwriters and adding keyboards. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, followed in 1991. It was less successful than its predecessors, particularly in the US, but scored another trio of charting singles in the UK, with the lead single becoming one of their most popular songs yet.

Their fourth album, &quot;Beggar on a Beach of Gold&quot;, appeared in 1995. It yielded a UK top 40 hit in the title track, and a number 12 hit in &quot;Over My Shoulder&quot;. The latter, which was their first hit to be co-written by Carrack, became arguably their most aired song on British radio.

Their run of successes was capped with 1996&#x27;s &quot;Hits&quot;, which compiled most of their hit singles with a new reworking of &quot;All I Need is a Miracle&quot; that reached number 27 in the UK, a higher placing than that of the original version. The album was certified platinum in the UK within two months of its release.

===Dissolution===
In 1995, the band began to fall apart: Adrian Lee and Peter Van Hooke left (before and after &quot;Beggar on a Beach of Gold&quot;, respectively), and Christopher Neil&#x27;s long tenure as songwriter/producer for the group ended. Rutherford opted to continue Mike and the Mechanics as a singer/songwriter trio. The group&#x27;s fifth studio album was released in 1999, &quot;Mike &amp; The Mechanics&quot;. It is generally known as &quot;M6&quot;, the &quot;Hits&quot; album being their fifth release. As the band no longer had a distribution deal with an American record label, &quot;M6&quot; was available to the American market as an import only. Its only hit, &quot;Now That You&#x27;ve Gone&quot;, peaked at No. 35 in the UK.

Another blow struck the following year: On 15 July 2000, Paul Young died from a heart attack. The band regrouped in 2004 as Mike and the Mechanics featuring Paul Carrack. As implied by the new name, Carrack played a larger role than before, performing all the band&#x27;s lead vocals and keyboards and co-writing all the songs. They released the album &quot;Rewired&quot;, which became their first album to lack a hit. Van Hooke briefly worked with the band again during this time, not as an official member but as a co-producer of &quot;Rewired&quot;. He also performed drums and percussion on the album and its tour.

Shortly after, Carrack became too involved with solo work to devote time to the group. In a 2007 interview Rutherford stated that Mike and the Mechanics had &quot;run its course.&quot;

===Second incarnation===
Over several months of 2009 and 2010, Rutherford formed a new band. Despite there being no hope of the original group ever reforming, he opted to again use the Mike and the Mechanics name. In a December 2009 interview, Rutherford stated that &quot;I&#x27;m actually doing a new Mike and the Mechanics album. I kind of thought I had put it to bed, but I still enjoy songwriting. Working with a few new co-writers and a couple of new faces for the band. Paul Carrack is doing some solo stuff, so we have a guy called Andrew Roachford, an R&amp;B kind of singer. It&#x27;s a little different, but the soul seems to be there.&quot;

A new album, &quot;The Road&quot;, and the &#x27;Hit the Road Tour 2011&#x27; were announced in November 2010. The album was released in April 2011. It featured both Roachford and Tim Howar on vocals, Luke Juby on keyboards, Gary Wallis on drums, and Anthony Drennan on guitar and bass. Though it became the first album not to feature B. A. Robertson as a co-writer, the album also marked the return of Christopher Neil as songwriter/producer. The tour included performances across the UK, Germany, and various other European cities.

In April 2017, this incarnation of the band released another album, &quot;Let Me Fly&quot;. It continues to tour.

In April 2019, Mike and the Mechanics released their ninth studio album &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, via BMG.

==Reception==
In a 1996 article for &quot;Q&quot; magazine, critic Peter Kane said that while the band &#x27;fly in the face of fashion&#x27;, their music has a &#x27;basic decency&#x27; and &#x27;unquestionably speaks to more people than many of us are sometimes prepared to accept&#x27;. He stressed, &#x27;Mike and the Mechanics: they&#x27;re quite good, really.&#x27;

<doc id="624039" wikidata="Q652157" url="?curid=624039" title="Saint Osmund">
<text>Osmund (died 3 December 1099), Count of Sées, was a Norman noble and clergyman. Following the Norman conquest of England, he served as Lord Chancellor (–1078) and as the second bishop of Salisbury, or Old Sarum.

==Life==
Osmund, a native of Normandy, accompanied William, Duke of Normandy to England, and was made Chancellor of the realm about 1070. He was employed in many civil transactions and was engaged as one of the Chief Commissioners for drawing up the Domesday Book.

Osmund became bishop of Salisbury by authority of Pope Gregory VII, and was consecrated by Archbishop Lanfranc around 3 June 1078. His diocese comprised the counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, and Berkshire, having absorbed the former bishoprics of Sherborne and Ramsbury under its incumbent Herman at the 1075 Council of London. In his &quot;Acts of the English Bishops&quot;, William of Malmesbury describes medieval Salisbury as a fortress rather than a city, placed on a high hill, surrounded by a massive wall. Peter of Blois later referred to the castle and church as &quot;the ark of God shut up in the temple of Baal.&quot;

Henry I&#x27;s biographer C. Warren Hollister suggests the possibility that Osmund was in part responsible for Henry&#x27;s education; Henry was consistently in the bishop&#x27;s company during his formative years, around 1080 to 1086.

In 1086 Osmund was present at the Great Gemot held at Old Sarum when the Domesday Book was accepted and the great landowners swore fealty to the sovereign.

Osmund died on the night of 3 December 1099, and was succeeded, after the see had been vacant for eight years, by Roger of Salisbury, a statesman and counsellor of Henry I. His remains were buried at Old Sarum, translated to New Salisbury on 23 July 1457, and deposited in the Lady Chapel, where his sumptuous shrine was destroyed under Henry VIII. A flat slab with the simple inscription  has lain in various parts of the cathedral. In 1644 it was in the middle of the Lady Chapel. It is now under the easternmost arch on the south side.

==Works==

Osmund&#x27;s work was threefold — first, the building of the cathedral at Old Sarum, which was consecrated on 5 April 1092.

Second was the constitution of a cathedral body. This was framed on the usual Norman model, with dean, precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, whose duties were exactly defined, some thirty-two canons, a subdean, and succentor. All save the last two were bound to a residence. These canons were &quot;&quot;secular&quot;,&quot; each living in his own house. Their duties were to be special companions and advisers of the bishop, to carry out with fitting solemnity the full round of liturgical services and to do missionary work in the surrounding districts. There was formed a school for clergy of which the chancellor was the head. The cathedral was thoroughly constituted &quot;the Mother Church&quot; of the diocese. Osmund&#x27;s canons were renowned for their musical talent and their zeal for learning, and had great influence on the foundation of other cathedral bodies.

Third was the formation of the &quot;Sarum Use&quot;. Osmund made selections of the practices he saw around him and arranged the offices and services. He initiated some revisions to the extant Celtic-Anglo-Saxon rite and the local adaptations of the Roman rite, drawing on both Norman and Anglo-Saxon traditions. Given the similarities between the liturgy in Rouen and that of Sarum, it appears that the liturgical practices of Rouen in northern France likely inspired the Sarum liturgical books. Intended primarily for his own diocese, the Ordinal of Osmund, regulating the Divine Office, Mass, and Calendar, was used, within a hundred years, almost throughout England, Wales, and Ireland, and was introduced into Scotland about 1250. 

The &quot;Register of St. Osmund&quot; is a collection of documents without any chronological arrangement, gathered together after his time, divided roughly into two parts: the &quot;Consuetudinary&quot; (Rolls Series, 1–185, and in Rock, vol. III, 1–110), styled &quot;De Officiis Ecclesiasticis&quot;, and a series of documents and charters, all more or less bearing on the construction of the cathedral at Old Sarum, the foundation of the cathedral body, the treasures belonging to it, and the history of dependent churches. The existing &quot;Consuetudinary&quot; was taken from an older copy, re-arranged with additions and modifications and ready probably when Richard Poore consecrated the cathedral at New Salisbury in 1225. A copy, almost verbatim the same as this, was taken from the older book for the use of St. Patrick&#x27;s, Dublin, which was erected into a cathedral and modelled on the church at Sarum by Henry de Loundres who was bishop from 1213 to 1228.

William of Malmesbury in summing up Osmund&#x27;s character says he was &quot;so eminent for chastity that common fame would itself blush to speak otherwise than truthfully concerning his virtue. Stern he might appear to penitents, but not more severe to them than to himself. Free from ambition, he neither imprudently wasted his own substance, nor sought the wealth of others&quot;.

Osmund gathered together a good library for his canons. A late-medieval source notes, somewhat disdainfully, that even as a bishop he would scribe, illuminate and bind books himself; by that period this was eccentric behaviour, but it was not so in 11th-century England. At one time Osmund thought Archbishop Anselm too unyielding and needlessly scrupulous in the dispute concerning investitures and in 1095 at the Council of Rockingham favoured the king. But after the Lateran Council in 1099, he boldly sided with the archbishop and the beautiful anecdote is related, showing his simple sincerity, how when Anselm was on his way to Windsor, Osmund knelt before him and received his forgiveness. He had a great reverence for St. Aldhelm who 300 years before as Bishop of Sherborne had been Osmund&#x27;s predecessor. He officiated at the saint&#x27;s translation to a more fitting shrine at Malmesbury and helped Lanfranc to obtain his canonization. Abbot Warin gave him a bone of the left arm of St. Aldhelm which he kept at Sarum where miracles were wrought. In 1228 the Bishop of Sarum and the canons applied to Gregory IX for Osmund&#x27;s canonization but not until some 200 years afterwards on 1 January 1457, was the bull issued by Callistus III. In 1472 a special indulgence was granted by Sixtus IV for a visit to his cathedral on his festival and a convocation held in St. Paul&#x27;s in 1481 fixed 4 December as the day to commemorate him. A house at Bishop Wordsworth&#x27;s School is named for him. He is commemorated by a statue in niche 178 on the west front of Salisbury Cathedral.

Osmund&#x27;s canonization took almost 230 years, with papal proceedings that started in 1228 not concluding until 1457.

Osmund is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 16 July.

<doc id="624040" wikidata="Q7350402" url="?curid=624040" title="Robert Tilton">
<text>Robert Tilton (born June 7, 1946) is an American televangelist and the former pastor of the Word of Faith Family Church in Farmers Branch, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. At his ministry&#x27;s peak in 1991, Tilton&#x27;s infomercial-style program, &quot;Success-N-Life&quot;, aired in all 235 American television markets (on a daily basis in the majority of them) and brought in nearly $80 million per year; it was described as &quot;the fastest growing television ministry in America.&quot;

When ABC&#x27;s &quot;Primetime Live&quot; raised questions about Tilton&#x27;s fundraising practices, a series of investigations into the ministry were initiated, and &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; was taken off the air. Tilton later returned to television on a new version of the program airing on BET and The Word Network.

==Life and career==
Robert Tilton was born in McKinney, Texas, on June 7, 1946 to Margaret (Gibson) and Clyde Tilton. He attended Cooke County Junior College and Texas Technological University. He married his first wife, Martha &quot;Marte&quot; Phillips, in 1968. According to his autobiographical materials, Tilton had a conversion experience to evangelical Christianity the following year and began his ministry in 1974, taking his family on the road to, in his words, &quot;preach this gospel of Jesus.&quot; Tilton preached to small congregations and revivals throughout Texas and Oklahoma. His family settled in Dallas and built the Word of Faith Family Church, a small nondenominational charismatic church in Farmers Branch, in 1976. The church started a local television program then known as &quot;Daystar&quot;.

Tilton&#x27;s young church was growing steadily, but &quot;Daystar&quot; failed to expand beyond the Dallas area until Tilton traveled to Hawaii his self-described version of Jesus&#x27;s forty days in the wilderness and came upon an increasingly popular new form of television programming: the late-night infomercial. Tilton was particularly influenced by Dave Del Dotto, a real estate promoter who hosted hour-long infomercials showing his glamorous life in Hawaii, as well as on-camera testimonials lauding his &quot;get rich quick&quot; books. Upon his return from Hawaii in 1981, Tilton, with the help of a US$1.3 million loan from Dallas banker Herman Beebe, revamped &quot;Daystar&quot; into an hour-long &quot;religious infomercial&quot; with the title &quot;Success-N-Life&quot;.

==&quot;Success-N-Life&quot;==
On &quot;Success-N-Life&quot;, Tilton regularly taught that all of life&#x27;s trials, especially poverty, were a result of sin. His message consisted mainly of impressing upon viewers the importance of making &quot;vows&quot;—financial commitments to Tilton&#x27;s ministry. His preferred vow, stressed frequently on his broadcasts, was $1,000. Occasionally, Tilton would claim to have received a word of knowledge for someone to give a vow of $5,000 or even $10,000. When a person made a vow to Tilton, he preached that God would recognize the vow and reward the donor with vast material riches. The show also ran &quot;testimonials&quot; of viewers who gave to Tilton&#x27;s ministry and reportedly received miracles in return, a practice that would be used as the basis for a later lawsuit from donors charging Tilton&#x27;s ministry with fraud.

A &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; story published in 1992 observed that Tilton spent more than 84% of his show&#x27;s airtime for fundraising and promotions, a total higher than the 22% for an average commercial television show; other sources put the total fundraising time during episodes of &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; closer to 68%. Some of Tilton&#x27;s fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, the head of a multimillion-dollar marketing empire writing donation letters for other televangelists like W. V. Grant and Don Stewart.

As a result of Tilton&#x27;s television success, Word of Faith Family Church grew to become a megachurch, with 8,000 members at its height. Tilton also wrote several self help books about financial success, including &quot;The Power to Create Wealth&quot;, &quot;God&#x27;s Laws of Success&quot;, &quot;How to Pay Your Bills Supernaturally&quot;, and &quot;How to be Rich and Have Everything You Ever Wanted&quot;. Most of his books were published in the 1980s and distributed via promotion on &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; and through the many mailings Tilton&#x27;s ministry sent his followers. The books were republished in the late 1990s to be used as centerpieces of his 1997 infomercial series and are now promoted on his current () daily live internet broadcast.

==Ministry and fundraising scandal==
In 1991, ABC News conducted an investigation of Tilton (as well as two other Dallas-area televangelists, Grant and Larry Lea). The investigation, assisted by Trinity Foundation president Ole Anthony and broadcast on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Primetime Live&quot; on November 21, 1991, alleged that Tilton&#x27;s ministry threw away prayer requests without reading them, keeping only the accompanying money or valuables sent to the ministry by viewers, garnering his ministry an estimated US$80 million a year.

===Allegations of exploitation of vulnerable people===
Anthony, a Christian minister whose organization works with the homeless and the poor on the east side of Dallas, first took an interest in Tilton&#x27;s ministry in the late 1980s after encountering needy people who told him they had lost all of their money making donations to high-profile televangelists, especially Tilton. Curious about the pervasiveness of the problem, the Trinity Foundation got on the mailing lists of several televangelists, including Tilton, and started keeping records of the many types of solicitations they received almost daily from various ministries.

Former Coca-Cola executive Harry Guetzlaff came to Trinity after he had been turned away from Tilton&#x27;s church when he found himself on hard times following a divorce. He had been a longtime donor and gave up his last $5,000 as a &quot;vow of faith&quot; just weeks earlier. Guetzlaff&#x27;s experience, combined with the sheer magnitude of mailings from Tilton&#x27;s ministry, spurred Anthony, a former Air Force intelligence officer and licensed private investigator, to start a full investigation of Tilton&#x27;s ministry. Guetzlaff joined Anthony in the task of gathering details on Tilton&#x27;s operation and later did much of the legwork in uncovering the paper trail for the ABC News investigation.

===Undercover investigation===
In a November 21, 1991, promotional appearance on &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot;, Diane Sawyer said that she had incidentally watched several televangelist programs, including &quot;Success-N-Life&quot;, and was both &quot;fascinated&quot; and &quot;disturbed&quot; by them. Stressing the public&#x27;s sensitivity to reporters questioning religion, Sawyer said that she spoke with other journalists, and then eventually to ABC producers, who then decided to conduct their own investigation into Grant, Lea, and Tilton. ABC producers learned about possible resources available from Anthony and Trinity, and contacted them for information. After comparing their accumulated notes, data and details, the two groups decided to pool their efforts and began planning the undercover portion of the story. Anthony agreed to portray himself as a Dallas-based minister with a small church looking into the ways TV ministries could grow so quickly, and the ABC producers would pose as Anthony&#x27;s &quot;media consultants.&quot;

===Meeting with Response Media===
The team, armed with hidden cameras and microphones, arrived for a meeting at Response Media, the Tulsa-based marketing firm handling Tilton&#x27;s mass mailings, to discuss a proposal sent by Anthony to Response Media about fundraising for a religious-based TV talk show. The director of Response Media, Jim Moore, described for Anthony and the hidden cameras (concealed in the undercover &quot;Primetime Live&quot; producers&#x27; glasses and handbags) many techniques used by Tilton to raise funds for his ministry. Moore also said that Tilton was doing &quot;far better than anyone knows&quot; and described the main strategy Tilton employed for such a high return rate on his mailings—that is, send the recipient a &quot;gimmick&quot; that compelled the recipient to mail something back in return, and most recipients would include some money along with it. Moore declined to disclose how much Response Media was paid for its services or how much money the mailings were generating for the Tilton ministry.

However, as part of his sales pitch to Anthony, Moore disclosed that the response letters generated by the fundraising mailings Response Media sends out for its clients were never delivered to the client; instead, they were sent unopened to the client&#x27;s financial institution or other institutions of choice. &quot;You never have to touch it&quot;, Moore added in response to a clarification question from Anthony about dealing with the gimmick objects sent to the potential donors in the mails. One of the ABC producers asked whether this was a standard practice—&quot;So the mail goes straight to the bank?&quot;—and Moore asserted that it was: &quot;The mail goes to the bank, and they put the money in your account. We just get the paper with the person&#x27;s name and how much they gave.&quot;

=== 1991 &quot;Primetime Live&quot; documentary (&quot;The Apple of God&#x27;s Eye&quot;) ===
Trinity members, acting on this information, started digging through dumpsters outside Tilton&#x27;s many banks in the Tulsa area as well as dumpsters outside the office of Tilton&#x27;s lawyer, J. C. Joyce (also based in Tulsa). Over the next thirty days, Trinity&#x27;s &quot;garbologists&quot;, as Anthony dubbed them, found tens of thousands of discarded prayer requests, bank statements, computer printouts containing the coding for how Tilton&#x27;s &quot;personalized&quot; letters were generated, and more, all of which were shown in detail on the Tilton segment within the &quot;Primetime Live&quot; broadcast, titled &quot;The Apple of God&#x27;s Eye&quot;. In a follow-up broadcast on November 28, 1991, Sawyer said that Trinity and &quot;Primetime Live&quot; assistants found prayer requests in bank dumpsters on fourteen separate occasions in a thirty day period.

===Denial===
Tilton vehemently denied the allegations and took to the airwaves on November 22, on a special episode of &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; entitled &quot;Primetime Lies&quot;, to air his side of the story. He asserted that the prayer requests found in garbage bags shown on &quot;Primetime Live&quot; were stolen from the ministry and planted in the dumpster for a sensational camera shot, and that he prayed over every prayer request received, to the point that he &quot;laid on top of those prayer requests so much that &#x27;the chemicals actually got into [his] bloodstream, and... [he] had two small strokes in [his] brain.&quot; Tilton remained defiant on claims regarding his use of donations to his ministry to fund various purchases, asking, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I allowed to have nothing?&quot; with regards to his ownership of multiple multimillion-dollar estates. Tilton also claimed that he needed plastic surgery to repair capillary damage to his lower eyelids from ink that seeped into his skin from the prayer requests.

===Further revelations===
After Trinity members spent weeks poring over the details of the documents they and ABC had uncovered, sorting and scrutinizing each prayer request, bank statement, and computer printout dealing with the codes Tilton&#x27;s banks and legal staff used when categorizing the returned items, Anthony called a press conference in December 1991 to present what he described as Tilton&#x27;s &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, using a large display covered in actual prayer requests, copies of receipts for document disposition, and other information which demonstrated what happened to money and prayer requests which the average viewer of Tilton&#x27;s television program sent him. When both Tilton and his lawyer J. C. Joyce reacted to the news by claiming the items Anthony was displaying had somehow been stolen by &quot;an insider&quot;, Anthony responded in a subsequent interview that &quot;Joyce was our mole—a lot of this stuff came from the dumpster outside his office.&quot;

&quot;Primetime Live&quot;″s original investigation and subsequent updates included interviews with several former Tilton employees and acquaintances. In the original investigation, one of Tilton&#x27;s former prayer hotline operators claimed the ministry cared little for desperate followers who called for prayer, saying Tilton had a computer installed in July 1989 to make sure the operators talked to no caller for longer than seven minutes. The former employee also revealed very specific instructions were given to them in terms of how to talk with callers and they were told to always ask for a $100 &quot;vow&quot; at a minimum. Also in the original report, a former friend of Tilton&#x27;s from college (who remained anonymous and was shown in silhouette) claimed both he and Tilton would attend tent revival meetings as a &quot;sport&quot; and would claim to be anointed and healed at the meetings. He added the two had often discussed the notion that after graduation they would set up their own roving revival ministry &quot;and drive around the country and get rich.&quot; In a July 1992 update to the investigation, &quot;Primetime Live&quot; interviewed Tilton&#x27;s former maid, who claimed prayer requests which were sent to Tilton&#x27;s house by the ministry were routinely ignored until he told her to move them out of the house and into the garage; according to the maid, &quot;they stacked up and stacked up&quot; in the garage until Tilton had them thrown away. In the same interview, Tilton&#x27;s former secretary came forward and claimed Tilton lifted excerpts from &quot;get rich quick&quot; books and used them in his sermons, and she never saw him perform normal pastoral duties such as visiting with the sick and praying with members.

===Government involvement===
Despite Tilton&#x27;s repeated denials of misconduct, the State of Texas and the federal government became involved in subsequent investigations, finding more causes for concern about Tilton&#x27;s financial status with each new revelation. After nearly 10,000 pounds of prayer requests and letters to the Tilton ministry were found in a disposal bin at a Tulsa area recycling firm in February 1992, along with itemized receipts of their delivery from Tilton&#x27;s main mail-handling service in Tulsa rather than from the church offices in Farmers Branch, Tilton admitted in a deposition given to the Texas Attorney General&#x27;s office that he often prayed over computerized lists of prayer requests instead of the actual prayer requests themselves, and that prayer requests were in fact routinely thrown away after categorization.

As each revelation became increasingly more damaging, viewership and donations declined dramatically. The last episode of &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; aired nationally on October 30, 1993. By that time, viewership had fallen 85 percent and monthly donations went from $8 million to $2 million.

===Failed libel action===
In 1992, Tilton sued ABC for libel because of its investigation and report, but the case was dismissed in 1993. Federal Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett, in his July 16, 1993, dismissal of the case, stated that information in Trinity&#x27;s logs on prayer requests reportedly found in dumpsters on September 11, 1991, &quot;could not have been found then because the postmark date was after September 11, 1991&quot;, but also noted that Anthony had recanted the erroneous entries in a subsequent affidavit. Tilton appealed the decision in 1993; although the findings of the original court were upheld in 1995, federal Judge Michael Burrage&#x27;s opinion criticized ABC and the &quot;Primetime Live&quot; producers for their editing of the story and noted that ABC had been warned by their own religion editor, Peggy Wehmeyer (who knew Anthony from her work as a religion reporter at ABC affiliate WFAA-TV in Dallas), that, &quot;Mr. Anthony could not be trusted and was obsessed with his crusade against [Tilton].&quot; Tilton once more appealed the decision, this time to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1996, but the court refused to hear the case.

=== Tilton sued for fraud ===
Several donors to Tilton&#x27;s television ministry sued Tilton in 1992–1993, charging various forms of fraud. One plaintiff, Vivian Elliott, won $1.5 million in 1994 when it was discovered that a family crisis center for which she had made a donation (and recorded an endorsement testimonial) was never built or even intended to be built. The judgment was later reversed on appeal.

As part of the defense strategy to the fraud cases, Tilton sued Anthony, Guetzlaff and four plaintiff&#x27;s lawyers who had filed the fraud cases against him in federal court in Tulsa. The tactic is known to critics as a &quot;SLAPP&quot; (strategic lawsuit against public participation) suit. Tilton claimed that the individuals conspired to violate his First Amendment rights under a federal statute designed to protect black citizens from the Ku Klux Klan. (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985.) Defense attorneys Martin Merritt of Dallas and ACLU lawyer Michael Linz, also of Dallas, with others, won dismissal for the six defendants in federal district court. On appeal, in &quot;Tilton v. Richardson&quot;, 6 F.3d 683 (10th Cir.1993), the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal on the grounds that 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985 did not protect a nonminority individual against a purely private conspiracy, if one existed. The fraud cases continued until the Texas Supreme Court eventually ruled that the plaintiffs could not prove damages because they could not show that, if Tilton had actually prayed over the prayer requests, the prayers would have been answered.

The decline of &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; also led to the end of Tilton&#x27;s 25-year marriage to his wife Marte, who had been administrative head of the Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center, in 1993. Dallas lawyer Gary Richardson, who represented many of the parties suing Tilton for fraud, attempted to intervene in the Tiltons&#x27; divorce, citing the potential for the divorce settlement to be used to hide financial assets that were currently part of the many fraud cases; Richardson&#x27;s petition to have the divorce action put on hold until after the fraud cases were settled was denied. Marte intervened in Tilton&#x27;s second divorce from Leigh Valentine, who had asked the court to include the church and all its assets as community property in the proceedings. Under Texas law, property accumulated during a marriage is considered community property and thus subject to division between the parties in a divorce. The jury eventually ruled against the request.

==Lexington Academy==
Lexington Academy was a small private Christian school in Farmers Branch that was founded in the early 1980s by Robert and Marte Tilton. The name &quot;Lexington&quot; was chosen in honor of the Battle of Lexington; the school mascot was the Patriots. The school was a member of the Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools (TAPPS), and won dozens of State Championships in Athletics, Academics, and Fine Arts during the less than twenty years of its existence, including five overall TAPPS State Championships. The school was dissolved in 1998 as a result of debts incurred from lawsuits against Tilton and his ministry.

==Reviving &quot;Success-N-Life&quot;==

After moving to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1996, Tilton returned to the airwaves in 1997 with a new version of &quot;Success-N-Life&quot;, buying airtime on independent television stations primarily serving inner city areas. The new version of &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; returned to Tilton&#x27;s previous message of asking for &quot;vows of faith&quot; from viewers instead of exorcisms. In 1998, the program began airing on Black Entertainment Television (BET) as part of its two-hour late night umbrella rotation block of religious programming entitled &quot;BET Inspiration&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; usually occupied the first hour of the BET programming block and also ran on The Word Network. Most of the shown on &quot;BET Inspiration&quot; were taped in the late 1990s—with testimonials from 1980s-era episodes interspersed throughout the episodes—but Tilton also recorded infomercials for his books at least once a year from 2003 to 2007, often appearing with his third wife, Maria Rodriguez, and their four French poodles.

The Word of Faith Family Church and World Outreach Center was finally formally dissolved by Tilton in 1996. Though Tilton was still listed as the church&#x27;s senior pastor, he had not preached at the church since March 16, 1996, when he named Chattanooga, Tennessee, minister Bob Wright as senior associate pastor, and its membership had declined to less than 300. The church building was purchased by the city of Farmers Branch in 1999 for use as a future civic center; however, the economy suffered a downturn and the plans were scrapped, and the building was finally demolished in 2003 to make room for a new Dallas Stars-sponsored youth hockey center.

In March 2005, Tilton started a new church in Hallandale, Florida, not far from his home in Miami Beach. The church had already existed for some time under the pastorship of former televangelist David Epley. Tilton&#x27;s new church, now called &quot;Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church&quot;, had approximately 200 members in 2007. On May 13, 2007, the church moved into a new location in Miami and was officially renamed &quot;Word of Faith Church&quot;, much like the original church in Dallas. Tilton also established a church in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2005, also originally named Christ the Good Shepherd Worldwide Church. It has also been officially renamed &quot;Word of Faith Church&quot;. The Las Vegas church&#x27;s resident pastor is Natalie Vafai.

==Current ministry==
When Tilton returned to television in 1997, he established his ministry&#x27;s headquarters in Tulsa, where his lawyer J. C. Joyce&#x27;s offices were located, and set up a post office box as its mailing address. A woman employed by Mail Services, Inc., a Tulsa-area clearinghouse that handled mail sent to Tilton&#x27;s ministry, said that when she worked for Mail Services, Inc. in 2001, prayer requests were still routinely thrown away after donations and pledges were removed. However, Tilton dropped the Tulsa address in late 2007 and used a Miami post office box to receive responses to his fundraising mailings. In January 2014, he was holding services at the Courtyard Marriott in Culver City, California, while having donations again sent to a post office box in Tulsa.

In 1998, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Tilton&#x27;s following disappeared after the investigations but he had &quot;joined dozens of other preachers to become fixtures on BET&quot;. Consequently, Tilton, along with Stewart and Peter Popoff, received &quot;criticism from those who say that preachers with a long trail of disillusioned followers have no place on a network that holds itself out as a model of entrepreneurship for the black community.&quot;

Steve Lumbley, who worked for Tilton&#x27;s ministry in 1991 when the original &quot;Primetime Live&quot; investigation took place, told a reporter for the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; in 2006 that reports of prayer request disposal that were the centerpiece of the ABC exposé were highly exaggerated. In an article for the &quot;Observer&quot; blog &quot;Unfair Park&quot;, Lumbley asserted that &quot;[t]he mailings all had some kind of gimmick. They weren&#x27;t godly at all. But the primary allegation that came out of that—that prayer requests were thrown away—was categorically untrue, and I can guarantee you that was not a normal practice.&quot; However, Lumbley, who now runs a Christian watchdog website called ApostasyWatch.com, does credit ABC and the Trinity Foundation for exposing Tilton&#x27;s unethical fundraising tactics, noting that, &quot;God was using Ole and ABC to chastise Tilton and bring him down.&quot;

Trinity still monitors Tilton&#x27;s television ministry as part of its ongoing televangelist watchdog efforts. In a 2003 interview published in the &quot;Tulsa World&quot;, Anthony estimated that with none of the Word of Faith Family Church overhead and with television production costs at a fraction of the original &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; program, Tilton&#x27;s current organization was likely grossing more than $24 million per year tax-free.

==Satire==
In 1985, two men began distributing a video created at KTZZ tv in Seattle, lampooning Tilton and his ostensible conversations with God. The video exploits Tilton&#x27;s facial expressions and preaching style. The original video contained no title screen and was roughly edited. The video featured a medley of footage from &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; overdubbed with well-timed sound effects of flatulence. Unofficial VHS copies of the video circulated in the U.S. through the late 1980s under such titles as &quot;Tooting Tilton&quot;, &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot; (the first title by the original distributors), &quot;Pastor Gas&quot;, &quot;The Joyful Noise&quot;, and &quot;The Farting Preacher&quot;. After the hosts of &quot;The Mark &amp; Brian Show&quot;, a radio program in Los Angeles, mentioned the video on the air, they saw the market potential and began selling official copies. Similar videos have since been made with more recent footage of Tilton and are distributed throughout the Internet, all under the &quot;Farting Preacher&quot; name. The video distribution (including digital bootlegs distributed online) expanded public awareness of Tilton and his controversial television ministry.

The song &quot;I Know&quot; on the Barenaked Ladies&#x27; 1996 album &quot;Born on a Pirate Ship&quot; includes the lines: &quot;If a hundred monkeys each could get their own show / perhaps one day a chimp might say,&quot; followed by a sample of Tilton saying, &quot;and you have faith! You just need to use it, saith the Lord.&quot;

The musician Pogo created the song &quot;Hoo Ba Ba Kanda&quot; using the sounds and words of Tilton from his program.

The comedy material of Ron White also includes mention of Tilton. In the opening to White&#x27;s act in the first &quot;Blue Collar Comedy Tour&quot; movie, White says that &quot;while sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos&quot;, he finds Tilton on TV and believes Tilton is talking specifically to him: &quot;Are you lonely?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Have you wasted half your life in bars pursuing sins of the flesh?&quot; &quot;This guy&#x27;s good ...&quot; &quot;Are you sitting in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos?&quot; White gapes in horror before squeaking &quot;Yes sir!&quot; &quot;Do you feel the urge to get up and send me a thousand dollars?&quot; (pause for effect) &quot;Close! I thought he was talking about &quot;me&quot; there for a second. Apparently, I ain&#x27;t the only cat on the block (who) digs Cheetos!&quot;

In the early 2000s, the Trinity Foundation put together a number of news broadcasts, including the initial &quot;Primetime Live&quot; piece, from the years surrounding the investigations into Tilton&#x27;s ministry on a DVD entitled &quot;The Prophet of Prosperity: Robert Tilton and the Gospel of Greed&quot;. The DVD also includes segments from &quot;The Daily Show&#x27;s&quot; &quot;God Stuff&quot; (hosted by Trinity member John Bloom, a.k.a. Joe Bob Briggs), excerpts from the &quot;Pastor Gas&quot; he was a kind man videos, and a number of mocking music videos, as well as moments from &quot;Success-N-Life&quot; showing Tilton&#x27;s more outrageous claims of &quot;visions from God.&quot;

The name &quot;Tilton&quot; is referred to in the song &quot;Cash Cow (A Rock Opera In Three Small Acts)&quot;, from the album called &quot;Squint&quot; by music artist and film director Steve Taylor, where it says:

Tilton&#x27;s antics are also lampooned in the area of software technology by Douglas Crockford. Crockford created &quot;The Tilton Macro Preprocessor&quot;, which he describes as &quot;one of the ugliest programming languages ever conceived&quot;.

Bruce Prichard, who portrayed Brother Love in the WWE, has stated that the character was largely based on Tilton&#x27;s way of speaking.

The comedian and satirist John Oliver criticized Tilton&#x27;s televangelism ministry as fraudulent on his nationwide television program &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; on August 17, 2015. Oliver and his team had corresponded with Tilton&#x27;s Faith Worldwide Church for seven months; it began when a $20 donation was sent to the organization. Oliver explained what happened during those months: the organization sent a letter back with a $1 bill asking Oliver to &quot;send it back&quot; with more offerings, leading to a slew of appeals for further donations with nothing substantive in return, according to an account in &quot;The Christian Post&quot;:

Oliver set up his own &quot;televangelism&quot; megachurch on his broadcast, which he called Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption.

<text>Maurice (died 1107) was the third Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of England, as well as Bishop of London.

==Life==

Maurice was Archdeacon of Le Mans before being named Chancellor in about 1078. He held the office until sometime between 1085 or 1086. He was nominated to the see of London on 25 December 1085 and consecrated in 1086, possibly on 5 April. He died on 26 September 1107 with his death being commemorated on 26 September.

In 1087, after a widespread fire, Maurice began rebuilding St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, possibly separate from the Anglo-Saxon church. In 1109 the cathedral was used for the consecration of the new archbishop of York, but it was probably not finished until about 1190. It was then one of the largest buildings in medieval England.

<doc id="624058" wikidata="Q723827" url="?curid=624058" title="Gerard (archbishop of York)">
<text>Gerard (died 21 May 1108) was Archbishop of York between 1100 and 1108 and Lord Chancellor of England from 1085 until 1092. A Norman, he was a member of the cathedral clergy at Rouen before becoming a royal clerk under King William I of England and subsequently his son King William II Rufus. Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor by William I, and he continued in that office under Rufus, who rewarded him with the Bishopric of Hereford in 1096. Gerard may have been with the king&#x27;s hunting party when William II was killed, as he is known to have witnessed the first charter issued by the new king, Henry I of England, within days of William&#x27;s death.

Soon after Henry&#x27;s coronation Gerard was appointed to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York&#x27;s claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury&#x27;s claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on reconciling the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.

Gerard was a patron of learning, to the extent that he urged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a language not commonly studied at that time. He himself was a student of astrology, which led to suggestions that he was a magician and a sorcerer. Partly because of such rumours, and his unpopular attempts to reform his cathedral clergy, Gerard was denied a burial inside York Minster after his sudden death in 1108. His successor as archbishop subsequently had Gerard&#x27;s remains moved into the cathedral church from their initial resting place beside the cathedral porch.

==Early life and career==
Gerard was the nephew of Walkelin, Bishop of Winchester, and Simon, Abbot of Ely. His parents were Osbert and Anna, and his brother Peter was also a royal clerk. The places and times of his birth and upbringing are unknown; he is documented as cantor of Rouen Cathedral, and precentor of the same cathedral, although the dates of his appointments to either office are unrecorded. By 1091 he had become archdeacon of Rouen. He served in the royal chancery under successive kings of England, William I and William II.

==Bishop of Hereford==
Gerard was appointed Lord Chancellor of England in 1085, and was present at William I&#x27;s deathbed in 1087. He continued as Chancellor to William Rufus until 1092; what precipitated his loss of office is unclear. He retained the king&#x27;s trust, for Rufus employed him in 1095 along with William Warelwast on a diplomatic mission to Pope Urban II regarding Archbishop Anselm receiving the pallium, the sign of an archbishop&#x27;s authority. Rufus offered to recognise Urban as pope rather than the antipope Clement III in return for Anselm&#x27;s deposition and the delivery of Anselm&#x27;s pallium into Rufus&#x27; custody, to dispose of as he saw fit. The mission departed for Rome in February 1095 and returned by Whitsun with a papal legate, Walter the Cardinal Bishop of Albano, who had Anselm&#x27;s pallium. The legate secured Rufus&#x27; recognition of Urban, but subsequently refused to consider Anselm&#x27;s deposition. Rufus resigned himself to Anselm&#x27;s position as archbishop, and at the king&#x27;s court at Windsor he consented to Anselm being given the pallium.

Although not yet ordained, Gerard was rewarded with the Bishopric of Hereford, and he was consecrated by Archbishop Anselm on 8 June 1096; his ordination as a deacon and priest had taken place the previous day. He assisted at the consecration of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London on 9 June 1096. He may have been a member of the hunting party in the New Forest on 2 August 1100 when Rufus was killed, as he witnessed King Henry I&#x27;s coronation charter – now known as the Charter of Liberties – three days later at Winchester, close by the New Forest. Gerard was present at Henry&#x27;s coronation that same day, along with Maurice, Bishop of London. Henry was probably crowned by Maurice, but the medieval chronicler Walter Map states that Gerard crowned Henry in return for a promise of the first vacant archbishopric. Gerard may have assisted Maurice in the coronation ceremony.

==Archbishop==
Gerard became Archbishop of York in December 1100. No source mentions him being invested by the king, but as Anselm urged Pope Paschal II to give Gerard his pallium, which he would have been unlikely to do if Gerard had been invested by Henry, that possibility seems remote. At Whitsun in 1101 King Henry I, with Anselm&#x27;s support, deprived Ranulf Flambard, Bishop of Durham, of the lands of the see of Durham, because Ranulf had defected to Henry&#x27;s elder brother Robert Curthose, who also claimed the English throne. Gerard then deposed Ranulf from his bishopric. Soon after his translation to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long Canterbury–York dispute. At the 1102 Council of Westminster, Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm&#x27;s. He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope, to whom he presented the king&#x27;s side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding investitures. The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced. Their claim was denied by Anselm&#x27;s representatives and the pope, who excommunicated Gerard until he recanted.

Gerard secured papal recognition of York&#x27;s metropolitan see for the Scots. He subsequently consecrated Roger as Bishop of Orkney, but refused to consecrate Thurgot to the see of St Andrews because Thurgot would not recognise the primacy of York. Gerard gave generously to the monasteries of his diocese; the medieval chronicler Hugh the Chantor stated that Thomas II, Gerard&#x27;s successor, accused Gerard of having dissipated the diocese&#x27;s endowment. King Olaf I of Man and the Isles wrote to &quot;G&quot;, Archbishop of York, asking for the consecration of &quot;our bishop&quot; by York, but it does not appear to have taken place under Gerard or his successor.

During the first four years of Henry&#x27;s reign Gerard was one of the king&#x27;s chief advisors, along with Robert of Meulan, Count of Meulan in Normandy and later Earl of Leicester. Gerard was one of Henry&#x27;s greatest supporters among the bishops during the Investiture Crisis. In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between Henry and Robert, the Count of Flanders, which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between Henry and his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between Henry and King Philip I of France. After Gerard&#x27;s return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham. In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused. From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join Bohemond of Antioch, who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard&#x27;s departure. In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did. At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm&#x27;s and the pope&#x27;s position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.

Gerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm&#x27;s attempts to assert Canterbury&#x27;s primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard&#x27;s death.

Gerard also had an uneasy relationship with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm&#x27;s better relations with Canterbury&#x27;s chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster&#x27;s chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons&#x27; argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between himself and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.

==Death and legacy==
Gerard was an associate of the anonymous author of the &quot;Quadripartitus&quot; and the &quot;Leges Henrici Primi&quot;, two 12th-century law books. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury charged Gerard with immorality, avarice and the practice of magic. Gerard encouraged at least one of his clergy to study Hebrew, a language not normally studied at the time. Some chroniclers considered his ownership of a Hebrew psalter to be disturbing, seeing it as a sign of heresy or secret Judaism. Among the sins that Malmesbury imputed to him was the study of Julius Firmicus Maternus, a late Roman astrologer, every morning, which to Malmesbury meant that Gerard was a sorcerer. Malmesbury further claimed that Gerard was &quot;lewd and lustful&quot;. In Gerard&#x27;s favour, Anselm regarded him as learned and highly intelligent. Some verses composed by Gerard survive in unpublished form, now in the British Library manuscript collection as part of manuscript Cotton Titus D.xxiv. A collection of his letters circulated in the mid-12th century, part of a bequest made to Bec Abbey in 1164 by Philip de Harcourt, the Bishop of Bayeux, but it is now lost.

Gerard died suddenly on 21 May 1108, at Southwell, on his way to London to attend a council. His body was found in an orchard, next to a book of &quot;curious arts&quot;, his copy of Julius Firmicus. His canons refused to allow his burial within his cathedral, but their hostility probably owed more to Gerard&#x27;s attempts to reform their lifestyle than to his alleged interest in sorcery. Gerard was at first buried beside the porch at York Minster, but his successor, Thomas, moved the remains inside the cathedral church.

<doc id="624063" wikidata="Q7186472" url="?curid=624063" title="Phixx">
<text>Phixx were an English-Irish boy band formed in 2003 from the five runners up on British TV show &quot;&quot;. The original members were Andrew Kinlochan, Chris Park, Mikey Green, Peter Smith, and Nikk Mager. Between 2003 and 2005, they achieved four top 20 singles in the UK. They broke up in 2006.

==Band history==
In February 2003, they signed to Hyperactive Management, who had previously been successful with Liberty X. In October 2003, they released their first single, &quot;Hold on Me&quot;, on the Concept Records label, which charted at number 10 in the UK, selling over 60,000 copies. March 2004 saw the release of their second single, &quot;Love Revolution&quot;. This sold over 50,000 copies and charted at number 13.

The videos and dance routines for their first two singles aroused media attention for their content, as they often featured the band topless or naked, often in sexually suggestive and aggressive situations with other men.

The third single, released in June 2004, was a cover of Duran Duran&#x27;s &quot;Wild Boys&quot;. During the release week, one version of the single was disqualified from the chart for being a few seconds too long, so the single dropped from the midweek chart position of 9, to number 23; however, an appeal was made to the chart regulators and both versions were eventually counted, giving a final position of number 12. The single sold over 65,000 copies.

Just after the release of &quot;Wild Boys&quot;, Peter Smith announced he was leaving to pursue a solo career and to give him more time to write music.

In autumn 2004, Phixx toured South Africa, where they were already popular. They released their debut album, &quot;Electrophonic Revolution&quot;, there and it became the best-selling album for their South African record company Sheer Music. The band co-wrote some of the songs for the album with Lee Ryan from Blue, Brian McFadden (formerly of Westlife), Alistair Griffin, Ultra, and Theo from Liberty X. All the tracks were produced by John McLaughlin, who had previously worked with Busted.

In December 2004, the band recorded a Christmas song written by Matt Baker for the children&#x27;s show &quot;Blue Peter&quot;. This song was available as a free download from the Blue Peter website in the weeks leading up to Christmas, but was never released for sale.

In January 2005, they released their fourth UK single, &quot;Strange Love&quot; (written by Judie Tzuke), which entered the UK Singles Chart at number 19. 

In May 2005, Nikk Mager also left the band. They continued to perform around England and Ireland as a three piece, and spent six months in the recording studio, writing and recording new material. In November 2005, Chris Park announced that the remaining members of Phixx would be breaking up for good in 2006, in order to work on their own solo projects. 

Band members made appearances on the music panel game, &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. Green appeared on the show in 2004, followed by Park a year later. Both appeared as panellists on Phill Jupitus&#x27; team. In 2006, fellow band member Mager appeared in the Identity Parade line-up, where the panellists were asked to pick out a forgotten star from a group of five. 

In 2008, Mager also appeared in the audition stage of &quot;The X Factor&quot;, but he was eliminated after his performance of &quot;The Rose&quot;. Phixx appeared at number 35 in Chantelle&#x27;s Top 50 Reality TV Stars.

Like Liberty X, who were formed from the runners up on the first series of &quot;Popstars&quot;, Phixx had a much longer career than the male winners of &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot;, One True Voice, who split up in 2003 after releasing just two singles. Phixx by contrast were active until 2006, and released several singles and an LP during their time together.

In 2013, Peter Smith appeared on &quot;The Voice of Ireland&quot;, but none of the coaches turned their chairs for him.

In 2024, Nikk Mager was announced as a new member of the Bucks Fizz spin-off The Fizz, alongside Matthew Pateman of Let Loose and Bad Boys Inc.

<doc id="624071" wikidata="Q4764866" url="?curid=624071" title="CTV Wild Channel">
<text>CTV Wild Channel is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel majority-owned by Bell Media. The channel primarily broadcasts factual series and documentaries relating to animals.

The network was originally established in 2001 as a Canadian version of the U.S. cable network [[Animal Planet]], expanding upon CTV&#x27;s existing relationship with Discovery Communications for Discovery Channel. Today CTV Wild Channel is owned by the Animal Planet Canada Company, which is a consortium consisting of CTV Speciality Television Inc. which owns 80% of the company (CTV Speciality Television Inc. is a division of Bell Media who owns 70% and ESPN owning 30%; stemming from its ownership of TSN, although it is not believed to be involved in the channel&#x27;s operations), with a further 20% stake held by Canadian AP Ventures Company (a joint venture between Warner Bros. Discovery and BBC Worldwide, stemming from the American version of Animal Planet originally having BBC Worldwide as an investor).

In January 2025, the channel was rebranded as CTV Wild Channel, due to Bell losing its rights to Warner Bros. Discovery factual brands and related programming to Rogers Sports &amp; Media. Rogers does not plan to launch a new linear channel for Animal Planet, with its programming to instead be distributed via digital platforms.

==History==
In November 2000, CTV Inc. was granted approval by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch Animal Planet, a service described as being &quot;broadly based on family entertainment that will combine high-quality Canadian programming and attractive series and documentaries from the U.S. counterpart, in the United States.

The channel was launched under its current ownership structure (with the exception of Bell Media, wherein Bell Globemedia, later renamed CTVglobemedia, owned its shares at the time) on September 7, 2001.

On June 30, 2008, Animal Planet unveiled a new on-air appearance, including a new logo and graphics, to align itself with the American service which had updated its appearance earlier that year.

Ownership changed once again when BCE (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) acquired 100% interest in CTVglobemedia and was renamed to Bell Media on April 1, 2011.

On June 10, 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced it had reached an agreement with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) for Canadian rights to its lifestyle brands beginning in January 2025, which were subsequently confirmed to include Animal Planet. This led to a lawsuit by Bell, which claimed the move would violate previous non-compete clauses with WBD; the matter was settled out of court in October. Rogers announced that Animal Planet content would move to its on-demand and streaming platforms including Citytv+, rather than a new linear channel.
On October 17, 2024, Bell Media announced the channel would rebrand as CTV Wild Channel on January 1, 2025. The channel will carry over certain Canadian series previously commissioned by Bell for Animal Planet Canada, as well as other animal-related content from third-party distributors.

The CRTC lists AP Ventures, Inc. (an joint venture of WBD and BBC Studios) as holding a 50% stake in the CTV Speciality subsidiary that holds CTV Wild Channel&#x27;s license; it is not yet known if WBD and BBC Studios will divest their stakes in the channel due to its change of Canadian partner.

==Animal Planet HD==
On June 17, 2011, Bell Media announced that it would launch &quot;Animal Planet HD&quot;, a high definition (HD) simulcast of the standard definition feed, by the end of 2011. The channel launched on December 15, 2011, initially on Bell Fibe TV and Shaw Cable and launched at a later date on Telus TV. About six years later, Shaw Direct added it and 5 other HD channels (Business News Network, Cooking Channel, Crime &amp; Investigation, OWN, and Travel + Escape) to the channel listing on September 21, 2017.

<doc id="624074" wikidata="Q1045845" url="?curid=624074" title="Lead vocalist">
<text>The lead vocalist in popular music is typically the member of a group or band whose voice is the most prominent melody in a performance where multiple voices may be heard. The lead singer sets their voice against the accompaniment parts of the ensemble as the dominant sound. In vocal group performances, notably in soul and gospel music, and early rock and roll, the lead singer takes the main vocal melody, with a chorus or harmony vocals provided by other band members as backing vocalists. Lead vocalists typically incorporate some movement or gestures into their performance, and some may participate in dance routines during the show, particularly in pop music. Some lead vocalists also play an instrument during the show, either in an accompaniment role (such as strumming a guitar part), or playing a lead instrument/instrumental solo role when they are not singing (as in the case of lead singer-guitar virtuoso Jimi Hendrix). 

The lead singer also typically guides the vocal ensemble and band with visual cues to indicate changes of tempo or dynamics, stops or pauses, and the starts of new sections (unless there is also a conductor onstage, as with a big band or unless an instrumentalist bandleader is providing this role). The lead vocalist also typically speaks to the audience between songs, to give information about a song (such as who wrote it or why it was chosen), introduce the band members, and develop rapport with the audience. The lead vocalist may also play a leadership role in rehearsals, unless there is a bandleader who takes on this role. If the lead singer is a singer-songwriter, she or he may write some or all of the lyrics or create entire songs (including chords and melodies).

Examples of a lead vocalist in rock music are Freddie Mercury from Queen and Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones. Similarly in soul music, Smokey Robinson was the lead singer of The Miracles. There may be two or more lead vocalists in a band who rotate singing lead between songs or within songs, such as with The Beatles or Fleetwood Mac, or two or more vocalists may share lead vocals on the same lines, as was often the case with ABBA.

==Terminology==
The lead vocalist may also be called the main vocalist or lead singer. Especially in rock music, the lead singer or solo singer is often the front man or front woman, who may also play one or more instruments and is often seen as the leader or spokesman of the band by the public.

In K-pop, the lead vocalist is often referred to as a vocalist with the second-best vocal technique.

==History==

It is uncertain when the term &quot;lead vocals&quot; was first used, but it may have emerged in the late 1930s, when rich vocal interplay with multiple voices where one or more voices may dominate began to impact on North American popular music, which was previously dominated by solo vocals. The practice of using a lead singer in vocal groups, however, has a longer history: an early form is the &quot;call and response&quot; found in work songs and spirituals sung by African-American slaves. Songs of the late nineteenth century frequently used a leading solo voice (or &quot;call&quot;), followed by a choral response by other singers. As the style developed through early commercial recordings and performances in the early 20th century, the role of the lead vocalist became more established, although popular groups of the 1930s and 1940s such as the Ink Spots and the Mills Brothers generally used different lead singers on different songs rather than keeping the same lead singer throughout. By the 1950s, singers such as Sam Cooke (with the Soul Stirrers) and Clyde McPhatter (with the Drifters) took on more clearly defined roles as lead singers, and by the end of the decade credited group names often changed to reflect the leading roles of the main vocalists, with examples such as Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers and Dion &amp; the Belmonts.
Academic David Horn has written:The influence of US rhythm and blues recordings may well be a crucial one in the assimilation of the format of lead singer plus backing group into the guitar-based British &#x27;beat&#x27; groups of the 1960s, and in US groups such as The Beach Boys. From these various points – including Motown – it went on to become a standard device in much rock and pop music. In some bands – most famously, The Beatles – the role of lead singer alternated (in this case, principally between two performers), while in others – for example, Herman&#x27;s Hermits – one lead singer dominated.

==Characteristics and exceptions in rock and pop music==
There are as many types and styles of lead singer as there are styles and genres of music. However, the lead singer of a group or band is usually the main focus of audiences&#x27; attention. The lead vocalist of band is sometimes called the &quot;front man&quot; or &quot;front woman&quot;, as the most visible performer in a group. While most bands have a single lead singer, many others have dual lead singers or other members of the band that sing lead on particular songs. The lead singer often defines the group&#x27;s image and personality to the general public.

In rock music, the lead singer is often the band&#x27;s leader and spokesperson. While lead singers or spokespersons for any musical ensembles can be called a front man, the term is used very widely in rock music. Since the position commonly has an expanded role from simple lead vocalists, there have been cases in which the front man for a band is someone other than the lead vocalist. For example, while the lead vocalist for the band Fall Out Boy is guitarist Patrick Stump, the bassist and lyricist, Pete Wentz, is generally called the front man, both in the media and by the band members themselves, since he represents the band in most interviews and contributes most to the band&#x27;s image in the popular media.

<text>William Giffard (), was the Lord Chancellor of William II and Henry I, from 1093 to 1101, and Bishop of Winchester (1100–1129).

== Family and early life ==
Giffard was the son of Walter and Ermengarde, daughter of Gerard Flaitel. Giffard was the brother of Walter and the sister of Rohese, wife of Richard fitz Gilbert.

He held the office of Dean of Rouen.

== Lord Chancellor ==
Giffard was Lord Chancellor under William II and Henry I from 1093 to 1101.

== Bishop of Winchester ==
On 3 August 1100 he became bishop of Winchester by nomination of Henry I. Henry nominated him probably in an attempt to win the support of the clergy in Henry&#x27;s bid to claim the throne directly after the death of William Rufus. He was one of the bishops elect whom Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury refused to consecrate in 1101 as having been nominated and invested by the lay power.

During the investitures dispute Giffard was on friendly terms with Anselm and was banished for declining to accept consecration from Gerard Archbishop of York in 1103. He was, however, one of the bishops who pressed Anselm, in 1106, to give way to the king. He was finally consecrated after the settlement of 1107 on 11 August, and became a close friend of Archbishop Anselm. As bishop, William aided the first Cistercians to settle in England, when in 1128 he brought monks from L&#x27;Aumône Abbey in France to settle at Waverley Abbey. He also restored Winchester Cathedral with great magnificence.

Among Giffard&#x27;s actions as bishop was the refounding of a religious house at Taunton and the staffing of it with Austin canons. The canons were drawn from Merton Priory. He was known for the close and good relations that he had with the monks of his cathedral chapter, sharing their meals and sleeping with them instead of in his own room.

== Death ==
Giffard died shortly before 25 January 1129, the date he was buried.

<text>Anthony Edwin Phillips (born 23 December 1951) is an English musician, songwriter, producer and singer who gained prominence as the original lead guitarist of the rock band Genesis, from 1967 to 1970. He left in July 1970 and learned to play more instruments, before he began a solo career. His departure from Genesis on the eve of the group&#x27;s breakthrough to mainstream popularity has led him to be dubbed &quot;the Pete Best of progressive rock&quot; (though unlike Best, Phillips left voluntarily).

Phillips released his first solo album, &quot;The Geese &amp; the Ghost&quot;, in 1977. He continues to release solo material, including further solo albums, television and film music, collaborations with several artists, and compilation albums of his recordings.

== Early life ==
Phillips was born on 23 December 1951 in Chiswick, England. He attended a preparatory school, during which he formed a group and took part in a performance of &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s a Dustman&quot; in the school hut as the singer, but forgot the words during it and was kicked out. This led to his decision to learn the guitar. He learned enough to perform lead guitar to a rendition of &quot;Foot Tapper&quot; by the Shadows in the school lounge. The Shadows were a major influence for Phillips in terms of acoustic guitar. At thirteen Phillips acquired a Stratocaster and wrote his first song, &quot;Patricia&quot;, an instrumental about the first girl he had a crush on. It gradually evolved into the Genesis song &quot;In Hiding&quot;, which appears on &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;. He was not entirely a self-taught guitar player; he received some tuition in rudimentary chords from classical guitarist David Channon, who became a big source of inspiration for Phillips, and used sheet music to songs by the Beatles that his mother would send him. Phillips then picked up more chord knowledge, and learned to copy &quot;reasonably well&quot;. As a teenager, Phillips briefly lived in the United States.

In April 1965, Phillips attended Charterhouse, an independent school in Godalming, Surrey. In the following month, he formed a band with fellow pupils Rivers Jobe, Richard Macphail, Mike Rutherford, and Rob Tyrell, naming themselves Anon. They based their sets on songs by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, and recorded one demo, Phillips&#x27;s song &quot;Pennsylvania Flickhouse&quot;. The group disbanded in December 1966. Phillips was also a member of another band during 1966, Spoken Word, which included David Thomas (vocals), Ronnie Gunn (piano), Jeremy Ensor (bass, later of the Principal Edwards Magic Theatre), David Chadwick (guitar), and Peter Gabriel (drums). They recorded an acetate, a cover of &quot;Evening&quot;.

== Career ==

=== 1967–1974: Genesis and hiatus ===
In January 1967, after Anon had split up, Phillips and Rutherford became a songwriting unit and started recording several demos. They invited Charterhouse pupil Tony Banks, a member of Garden Wall, another disbanded school group, to play keyboards. Banks agreed, and suggested involving his Garden Wall bandmates, singer Peter Gabriel (the same one who was the drummer for Spoken Word) and drummer Chris Stewart. After the five made a demo tape, it was given to Jonathan King, who signed them to his publishing company and had them record some singles. He named the group Genesis, and suggested they record a studio album, which became &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;. Phillips was particularly angry when King added string arrangements to their songs without their knowledge, since the limitations of the recording technology meant that everything else on the album had to be reduced to mono as a consequence. Phillips said he had little role in Genesis&#x27;s songwriting during this period, and that most of the songs on &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot; were written by Gabriel and Banks.

In September 1969, the 17-year-old Phillips chose not to pursue a university degree and instead reunite with Gabriel, Banks and Rutherford after they had decided to become a full-time band. However, early in 1970 the constant touring had become wearing on Phillips partly due to the lack of scope for solos in the band&#x27;s set and the shortage of time to develop new material. To further complicate matters he had developed stage fright which got progressively worse as time went on, and battled with it for three months thinking it was a passing phase. After falling ill with bronchial pneumonia, Phillips was advised by his doctor to quit the band.

In June 1970, Phillips had recovered enough to reunite with his bandmates and record their second album, &quot;Trespass&quot;. Despite his various problems at the time, Phillips enjoyed the recording sessions. By this time Genesis songs were more often written by the group as a whole, and Phillips was pleased when a song he had originally written by himself, &quot;Visions of Angels&quot;, was expanded with a group-composed middle section that he felt made the song much more powerful. After recording finished in July the band resumed touring, though early into the tour Phillips announced his decision to leave. His final gig took place at Haywards Heath on 18 July. Tour manager Richard Macphail later said that the group seriously considered disbanding altogether in the wake of Phillips&#x27;s departure.

&quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, the next Genesis album, opens with &quot;The Musical Box&quot; which is based on a piece written by Phillips and Rutherford originally titled &quot;F#&quot; (pronounced &quot;F Sharp&quot;). Steve Hackett, who became Genesis&#x27;s guitarist half a year after Phillips left, commented that at the time of their fifth album, &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;, the 12-string guitar style developed during Phillips&#x27;s era was still important to Genesis&#x27;s work and he felt Phillips deserved more credit for &quot;architecting the sound of Genesis&quot;.

After leaving Genesis, Phillips lacked a solid direction. He recalled listening to Jean Sibelius around the time of his departure and recognised his musical ability was &quot;terribly limited&quot;, which encouraged him to become a more proficient musician. In 1974, he became a qualified music teacher and gave lessons to students. By 1977, he was playing classical guitar and piano, and studied orchestration.

=== 1974–present: Solo career ===
After leaving Genesis, Phillips studied classical music (especially classical guitar) and made recordings in collaboration with Harry Williamson, Mike Rutherford and Phil Collins, among others. His first solo album, &quot;The Geese &amp; the Ghost&quot;, was issued in 1977.

Following the commercial failure of &quot;The Geese &amp; the Ghost&quot;, Phillips was pushed in a pop direction by his record labels. They released his second album, &quot;Wise After the Event&quot;, in 1978. This was followed the next year by &quot;Sides&quot;. Both of these albums were produced by Rupert Hine and were intended to reach a mainstream audience, though neither album was successful in that regard.

In its initial release in the UK, &quot;Sides&quot; was accompanied by a more experimental album entitled &quot;Private Parts &amp; Pieces&quot;; in the US and Canada the two albums were issued separately. &quot;Private Parts &amp; Pieces II: Back to the Pavilion&quot; followed the next year, and several further sequels were issued in the 1980s and 1990s. According to Phillips, the series &quot;arose partly out of poverty. I was just getting by, library music was just getting going. I had to issue a collection of twelve-string or solo-piano stuff to boost my income.&quot;

Phillips began writing material with Andrew Latimer of Camel in 1981, and was a featured performer on that band&#x27;s album, &quot;The Single Factor&quot; (released in 1982).

Phillips released a mainstream pop album entitled &quot;Invisible Men&quot; in 1983. He later claimed that this project went &quot;horribly wrong&quot; as a result of commercial pressures, and would subsequently eschew mainstream success in favour of more specialised material. He co-wrote &quot;Tears on the Ballroom Floor&quot; for &quot;I Hear Talk&quot; by Bucks Fizz.

Since leaving Genesis, Phillips has remained involved in a variety of musical projects, including soundtrack work in England, often for the label Atmosphere, part of the Universal Music Group. In 1988 he recorded an album with Harry Williamson called &quot;Tarka&quot;. The album&#x27;s cover featured a picture of a woman and did not credit Phillips or Williamson, which led to it often being filed under &quot;female vocalist&quot; in record shops. In the mid-1990s, he released an album entitled &quot;The Living Room Concert&quot;, which featured solo acoustic versions of his earlier material. He also provided archival material for the first Genesis box set, &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot;, released in 1998.

Several of his albums feature artwork by Peter Cross.

In 2008, the first Anthony Phillips biography, &quot;The Exile&quot;, by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno). &quot;Harvest of the Heart: An Anthology&quot;, a 5-CD box set chronicling Phillips&#x27;s solo career and collaborations, was released in 2014.

<doc id="624083" wikidata="Q719798" url="?curid=624083" title="Player versus player">
<text>Player versus player (PvP) is a type of multiplayer interactive conflict within a game between human players. This is often compared to player versus environment (PvE), in which the game itself controls its players&#x27; opponents. The terms are most often used in games where both activities exist, particularly MMORPGs, MUDs, and other role-playing video games, to distinguish between gamemodes. PvP can be broadly used to describe any game, or aspect of a game, where players compete against each other. PvP is often controversial when used in role-playing games. In most cases, there are vast differences in abilities between players. PvP can even encourage experienced players to immediately attack and kill inexperienced players. PvP is often referred to as player killing in the cases of games which contain, but do not focus on, such interaction.

==History==
&quot;Genocide&quot;, an LPMud launched in 1992, was a pioneer in PvP conflict as the first &quot;pure PK&quot; MUD, removing all non-PvP gameplay and discarding the RPG-style character development normally found in MUDs in favor of placing characters on an even footing, with only player skill providing an advantage. Extremely popular, its ideas influenced the MUD world heavily.

==Classifications==
===Player Killing===
PvP can also create additional facets in the community. In &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot;, a rift formed between those who enjoyed PKing, those who enjoyed hunting the PKs and those who simply did not want to fight at all. The &quot;Renaissance&quot; expansion later added a &quot;Trammel&quot; facet where PvP was not allowed, giving some out to the UO crowd that did not wish to engage in PvP at all. &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; contained a server that was completely unrestricted in player interactions where massive &quot;PK&quot; and &quot;Anti (PK)&quot; dynasties formed.

====Anti-Player Killing====
Anti-PKing, also known as Player Killer Killing, PK Killing, or PKK, is a form of in-game player justice. Often motivated by an overpopulation of in-game player killers, vigilante Anti-PKs hunt Player Killers and Player Griefers with vengeance.

==RvR (realm versus realm) combat==

In 2001, Mythic Entertainment introduced a new team-based form of PvP combat with the release of &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;.

This was a new concept to graphical MMORPGs, but was first introduced in the game that preceded &quot;DAoC&quot;, &quot;Darkness Falls: The Crusade&quot;, which has since been shut down in favor of building on &quot;DAoC&quot;. Other MMORPG games now also feature this type of gameplay.

==Ethical issues==
Player-vs-player dynamics involve ethical issues with players. Because of ganking, some game developers view PvP with contempt. Despite the advantage experienced players have over new players, many game developers have assumed an honor code would prevent PKing.

<text>Waldric (&quot;aka&quot; Gaudry, died 1112) was the eighth Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of England, from 1103 to 1107. He was also Bishop of Laon from 1106 to 1112. He had been a royal chaplain as early as 3 September 1101.

At the battle of Tinchebray (1106), Orderic Vitalis states, &quot;Waldric capellanus regis&quot; captured Robert Curthose, Henry I of England&#x27;s brother and leader of the opposing forces as Duke of Normandy.

As bishop he was greedy and violent, unconventional in his habits and joking, a prodigal spender on himself; he is portrayed in very unflattering terms in the 1115 chronicle &quot;Monodiae&quot; of Guibert of Nogent. He had Gerard of Quierzy murdered in the very cathedral of Laon.
His election as bishop was contested; he had been hurried into minor orders after the battle and made a canon of Rouen, but it was upheld by Pope Paschal II at the Council of Langres. He was murdered at Eastertide 1112, in the crypt of Laon Cathedral by citizens of Laon who had set up a commune in the city. Guibert&#x27;s account of this event alludes to Isengrin, making it of literary-historical value.

<text>BookTelevision was a Canadian English language specialty channel owned by Bell Media.

The channel was originally established in 2001 by Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Ltd., then partially owned by CHUM Limited, airing programming relating to books, literature, and various media.

Following its acquisition by Bell, the network later shifted primarily to airing Bell Media library programming with little relevance to its original format. Amid declining investments in the channel, BookTelevision was shut down on February 21, 2021.

==History==
In November 2000, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta, a company majority owned by CHUM Limited (60%), was awarded a category 1 television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) called &quot;BookTelevision - The Channel&quot;, described as &quot;a national English-language Category 1 specialty television service that will feature magazines and talk shows, dramas and documentaries that are exclusively based upon printed and published works, and offered with additional programming that provides an educational context and promotes reading.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001. Although, shortly after the channel&#x27;s launch, &quot;The Channel&quot; was dropped from its name and logo, resulting in a name change to simply BookTelevision.

On February 15, 2005, CHUM completed the purchase of the remaining interest in LSTA, bringing its ownership to 100 percent. A year later, in July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later renamed CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated $1.7 billion CAD, included in the sale was LSTA and its interest in BookTelevision. The sale was subject to CRTC approval and was approved in June 2007, with the transaction completed on June 22, 2007. In 2008, LSTA (then known as Access Media Group) was wound up into CTV Limited (the renamed CHUM Limited).

On September 10, 2010, BCE (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of $3.2 billion CAD. The deal which required CRTC approval, was approved on March 7, 2011 and closed on April 1 of that year, on which CTVglobemedia was rebranded Bell Media.

Along with Fashion Television, the channel later abandoned its original format, and began to primarily air reruns of library programming from other Bell Media networks, and after CRTC category restrictions were repealed in 2015, reruns of dramas such as &quot;JAG&quot; and &quot;Matlock&quot;, properties that had no literary inspiration. The channel ceased investments in original Canadian programming, and was rarely promoted by Bell. In January 2021, the CRTC approved a request by Bell to revoke BookTelevision and Fashion Television&#x27;s licenses, stating that it planned to shut both channels down on February 21.

<text>Carl Vilhelm Ludwig Charlier (1 April 1862 – 4 November 1934) was a Swedish astronomer. His parents were Emmerich Emanuel and Aurora Kristina (née Hollstein) Charlier.

==Career==
Charlier was born in Östersund. He received his Ph.D. from Uppsala University in 1887, later worked there and at the Stockholm Observatory and was Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Observatory at Lund University from 1897.

He made extensive statistical studies of the stars in our galaxy and their positions and motions, and tried to develop a model of the galaxy based on this. He proposed the siriometer as a unit of stellar distance.

Charlier was also interested in pure statistics and played a role in the development of statistics in Swedish academia. Several of his pupils became statisticians, working at universities and in government and companies.

Related to his work on galactic structure, he also developed a cosmological theory based on the work of Johann Heinrich Lambert. In the resulting Lambert-Charlier Hierarchical Cosmology, increasingly large areas of space contain decreasing densities of matter, the principle being introduced to avoid the observational inconsistency that would otherwise emerge from Olbers&#x27;s paradox.

Late in his career, he translated Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; into Swedish. He died in Lund, aged 72.

<doc id="624088" wikidata="Q7361492" url="?curid=624088" title="Roma Street Parkland">
<text>Roma Street Parkland covers 11 hectares in the centre of the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The Roma Street Parkland is adjacent to the former Brisbane Transit Centre and the Roma Street railway station from which it takes its name (the park does not directly face onto Roma Street). There is pedestrian access to the Roma Street Parkland from the Roma Street railway station, as well as from Albert Street, and from the section of the Parkland which was formerly called &quot;Albert Park&quot; on Wickham Terrace. Roma Street Parkland is open to visitors 24 hours a day, except for the Spectacle Garden and Rainforest Walk, which are open daily from dawn until dusk. 

There is also a car park area, with road access from the intersection between Wickham Terrace, College Road and Gregory Terrace. Roma Street Parkland is the world&#x27;s largest subtropical garden in a city centre. The parkland features a variety of themed gardens and recreational areas, with an extensive web of pathways and boardwalks traversing cascading waterways and rocky outcrops, and also &quot;in situ &quot;artworks by 16 local artists.

==History of the site==
Local Indigenous people used the area for thousands of years conducting meetings and ceremonies.

In 1825 the Roma Street Parkland area was part of the original Brisbane settlement. In 1875 a railway terminal station on Roma Street was constructed as part of the Main Line railway linking Brisbane to Ipswich and Toowoomba.

The terminal grew to become a major goods yard for Brisbane and, between 1911 and 1934, the area was extensively redeveloped to support its increase in services. In 1920 extensive excavation, removing 554,300 cubic metres of earth, permanently altered the steep terrain creating the current day artificial escarpment and the boundary of the former Albert Park. During World War II, the terminal was vital for transporting war materials and military personnel north.

Continuing to grow, the Roma Street railway station was redeveloped to service a metropolitan and long-distance train network. Because of limitations of the site revealed through the increasing mechanisation of freight handling and the use of containers, the facility was eventually relocated to Acacia Ridge in 1991.

==Roma Street Parkland redevelopment==
In February 1995, Premier Wayne Goss announced the railway goods yard would be redeveloped as parkland. Construction began in 2000 with the parkland opened to the public in 2001. The design of the new park was created by a landscape architecture and urban design consortium called &#x27;PARC&#x27; lead by Mark Fuller (Gillespies), Lawrie Smith (Landplan), Malcolm Middleton (DEM Design) and Joe Hruda (Civitas). 

The project won its first award before it had opened: a commendation in the Cement and Concrete Association of Australia Streetsmart awards for the innovative concrete finishes created by the use of coloured concrete and an apparently random pattern of rough cast concrete generated by the formworkers which makes the finish appear to change through the day depending on the angle of the sun and the length of shadows cast by the detailing on the walls. The technique was created through a design and construction collaboration between project designers PARC, managing contractor Abigroup and the Queensland Department of Public Works.

Brisbane&#x27;s Indian community commissioned a statue of Gandhi, created by Ram V. Sutar and Anil Sutar. It was unveiled by Narendra Modi, then Prime Minister of India in 2014, during the G20.

==Amphitheatre==
Roma Street Parkland has an open-air amphitheatre, previously known as the Albert Park Amphitheatre, which had been a feature of Albert Park for a number of decades before the Roma Street Parkland was established.

Outdoor film exhibitor Moonlight Cinema holds a licence to operate an outdoor cinema experience within the park, offering hot food, beverages, film festivals, and many other activities during summer months annually. 

From lively music festivals and cultural celebrations to family-friendly markets and educational workshops, there&#x27;s always something happening to engage and entertain visitors of all ages.Plays are performed at the &quot;Amphitheatre&quot; by the Queensland Theatre Company, and the Queensland Shakespeare Ensemble, as well as by other theatre groups, with many plays by William Shakespeare having been performed at the amphitheatre. The convenient access to the Amphitheatre is through Wickham Terrace near M.K. Gandhi statue.

Other theatre productions, including orchestral concerts, have also been performed there. One such concert, in which the music was by Johann Strauss, was called &quot;Strauss Beneath the Stars&quot;, which was presented in October 1983.

The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Christmas Carols and Brisbane&#x27;s Carols by Candlelight concerts were held at the Albert Park Amphitheatre before Riverstage was built in the City Botanic Gardens.

== Awards ==
Roma Street Parkland is one of five locations in Australia to hold the 2022/2023 Green Flag Award, an international accreditation given to the world&#x27;s best green spaces.

<doc id="624089" wikidata="Q4656068" url="?curid=624089" title="A Conflict of Visions">
<text>A Conflict of Visions is a book by Thomas Sowell. It was originally published in 1987; a revised edition appeared in 2007.

==Summary==
Sowell&#x27;s opening chapter attempts to answer the question of why the same people tend to be political adversaries in issue after issue, when the issues vary enormously in subject matter and sometimes hardly seem connected to one another. The root of these conflicts, Sowell claims, are the &quot;visions&quot;, or the intuitive feelings that people have about human nature; different visions imply radically different consequences for how they think about everything from war to justice.

The rest of the book describes two basic visions, the &quot;unconstrained&quot; and &quot;constrained&quot; visions, which are thought to capture opposite ends of a continuum of political thought on which one can place many contemporary Westerners, in addition to their intellectual ancestors of the past few centuries.

The book could be compared with George Lakoff&#x27;s 1996 book &quot;Moral Politics&quot;, which aims to answer a very similar question.

Sowell&#x27;s book has been published both with and without the subtitle &quot;Ideological Origins of Political Struggles&quot;.

Steven Pinker&#x27;s book &quot;The Blank Slate&quot; calls Sowell&#x27;s explanation the best theory given to date. In his book, Pinker refers to the &quot;unconstrained vision&quot; as the &quot;utopian vision&quot; and the &quot;constrained vision&quot; as the &quot;tragic vision&quot;.

==The competing visions==
Sowell lays out these concepts in his &quot;A Conflict of Visions&quot;, and &quot;The Vision of the Anointed&quot;. These two visions encompass a range of ideas and theories.

===The unconstrained vision===
Sowell argues that the unconstrained vision relies heavily on the belief that human nature is essentially good. Those with an unconstrained vision distrust decentralized processes and are impatient with large institutions and systemic processes that constrain human action. They believe there is an ideal solution to every problem, and that compromise is never acceptable. Collateral damage is merely the price of moving forward on the road to perfection. Sowell often refers to them as &quot;the self anointed.&quot; Ultimately they believe that man is morally perfectible. Because of this, they believe that there exist some people who are further along the path of moral development, have overcome self-interest and are immune to the influence of power and therefore can act as surrogate decision-makers for the rest of society.

===The constrained vision===
Sowell argues that the constrained vision relies heavily on the belief that human nature is essentially unchanging and that man is naturally inherently self-interested, regardless of the best intentions. Those with a constrained vision prefer the systematic processes of the rule of law and experience of tradition. Compromise is essential because there are no ideal solutions, only trade-offs. Those with a constrained vision favor empirical evidence and time-tested structures and processes over intervention and personal experience. Ultimately, the constrained vision demands checks and balances and refuses to accept that all people could put aside their innate self-interest.

==Reception==

<text>CTV Drama Channel is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel owned by Bell Media. The channel primarily broadcasts drama series and films.

The channel was founded as the Canadian version of the American channel Bravo (which is now owned by NBCUniversal) on January 1, 1995 by Moses Znaimer and its owner CHUM Limited, and originally focused on performing arts, drama, and independent film. After the acquisition of CHUM by CTVglobemedia, the channel pivoted away from arts programming, and segued to a general entertainment format with a focus on drama (unlike its American counterpart, which has largely shifted to reality television programming targeting a female audience).

==History==
In the 1980s, a precursor to Bravo existed called C Channel. The service was boasted as a national commercial-free pay television channel that focused on arts programming. C Channel launched on February 1, 1983, before it went bankrupt and ceased operations five months later on June 30 of that year due to its inability to attract a sufficient number of subscribers at a price of $16 per month.
Over 10 years later, another attempt at an arts-based channel was proposed when CHUM Limited applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) for a license to operate Bravo. In June 1994, CHUM&#x27;s application for Bravo was approved, citing its nature of service as focusing on &quot;performance and drama programming, as well as documentary and discussion&quot;.

Bravo was launched on January 1, 1995, licensing the name from Rainbow Media, who partnered with CHUM to launch MuchMusic USA (later known as Fuse TV).

===Sale to CTVglobemedia/Bell Media===

In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later called CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion, included in the sale was Bravo The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007, and the transaction was completed on June 22, 2007 while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Media. After CTVglobemedia&#x27;s purchase of Bravo, the channel increasingly shifted its focus toward more television and film dramas (such as &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;), and lessened its focus on arts programming.

On September 10, 2010, BCE Inc. (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of $3.2 billion. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011, and was finalized on April 1 of that year, on which CTVglobemedia was rebranded Bell Media. a high definition simulcast feed of Bravo, which broadcasts in the 1080i resolution format, was launched later that year on October 6, 2011.
While under Bell Media ownership, Bravo unveiled a new on-air logo and new on-air presentation in 2012 as part of an extensive network rebranding.

On June 6, 2013, Bell announced that Bravo would become the company&#x27;s first network to implement a TV Everywhere service, which would allow subscribers of participating television service providers that carry Bravo to stream video on demand content as well as a live feed of the Bravo channel via the Bravo Go app.

On June 7, 2018, it was announced that Bravo would be re-branded as &quot;CTV Drama&quot;, as part of a re-branding of several Bell Media specialty channels under the CTV name. The following year, it was revealed the channel would rebrand as CTV Drama Channel on September 12, 2019. Bell also announced a commitment to order 20 made-for-TV film adaptations of Harlequin novels from Harlequin Studios, which would air on CTV Drama Channel and Vrak.

In June 2024, Rogers announced a licensing agreement with Comcast subsidiary NBCUniversal to relaunch the Bravo brand in Canada in September of that year. On August 28, 2024, Rogers confirmed that OLN would relaunch as Bravo on September 1.

==Programming==
In its early years as Bravo, the channel often aired short films by Canadian artists between programs, funded by its foundation Bravo!FACT, which ranged from comedy to drama to opera to jazz to animation. Many of these also aired on Bravo&#x27;s weekly series &quot;Bravo!FACT Presents&quot;. Bravo has also produced a limited amount of scripted and non-scripted series and has aired various notable specials, including a telecast of Canadian rock band Spirit of the West&#x27;s &quot;Open Heart Symphony&quot; concert with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra, along with three early telefilms within the &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; franchise: &quot;Except the Dying&quot;, &quot;Poor Tom Is Cold&quot; and &quot;Under the Dragon&#x27;s Tail&quot;.

Since the retirement of CRTC&#x27;s genre protection rules in 2015 outside of news and sports, CTV Drama Channel, by that point, currently airs a mix of programming from U.S. cable and broadcast networks, as well as repeats of Canadian-produced shows to fulfill Canadian content quotas.

<text>Ranulf was a masculine given name in Old French and Old Occitan, and is a masculine given name in the English language. &quot;Ranulf&quot; was introduced into England by the Norman conquest or alternatively is said to have been introduced to Scotland and northern England, by Scandinavian settlers in  Early Middle Ages.

The Old Occitan anthroponym Ranulf (&quot;Ramnulf&quot;, &quot;Rannulf&quot;) does not contain exactly the same first element, but &quot;hram&quot;, short form of Gothic &quot;hrabns&quot; &quot;raven&quot;.

<text>Asenath (, ; Koine Greek: Ἀσενέθ, &quot;Asenéth&quot;) is a minor figure in the Book of Genesis. Asenath was a high-born, aristocratic Egyptian woman. She was the wife of Joseph and the mother of his sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.

There are two Rabbinic approaches to Asenath. One holds that she was an Egyptian woman who converted to marry Joseph. This view has her accepting God before marriage and then raising her two sons in the tenets of Judaism. This presents her as a positive example of conversion to Judaism and places her among the devout women converts. The other approach argues she was not Egyptian by descent but was from the family of Jacob. Traditions that trace her to the family of Jacob relate that she was born as the daughter of Dinah. Dinah was raped by Shechem and gave birth to Asenath, whom Jacob left on the wall of Egypt, where she was later found by Potiphar. She was then raised by Potiphar&#x27;s wife and eventually married Joseph. However, in &quot;Genesis Rabbah&quot; 80:11 she is not stated to be Dinah&#x27;s daughter; rather, Dinah&#x27;s rape resulted in her giving birth to Shaul, the son of Simeon.

Asenath&#x27;s importance is related to the birth of her two sons, who later become forefathers of two of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.

==Name==

Her name is believed to derive from the Ancient Egyptian &quot;--&quot;, meaning &quot;belonging/she belongs to Neith&quot;. Neith was an Egyptian goddess.

&quot;Asenath&quot; or &quot;Osnat&quot; is a commonly used female first name in present-day Israel.

== Portrayal ==
Asenath is mentioned in three verses of the Bible, all in the Book of Genesis. First appearing in Genesis 41:45, Asenath is said to have been given by the Pharaoh to Joseph as a wife. Here, she is referred to as the daughter of Potipherah, priest of On (Gk. Heliopolis). Genesis 41:50 says that before the years of famine, Joseph had two sons with Asenath. The firstborn was named Manasseh and the second Ephraim. Later, in Genesis 46:20, Joseph and Asenath are mentioned in the family of Jacob; the verse says that in Egypt, Joseph had two sons named Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On, bore to Joseph.

In the Book of Jubilees, generally considered to be apocryphal, Asenath is said to be given to Joseph to marry by the Pharaoh, a daughter of Potiphar, a high priest of Heliopolis, with no clarification as to whether or not this Potiphar is the same Potiphar whose wife falsely accused Joseph of attempting to rape her. While in the Midrash and Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, she is said to be the daughter of Dinah, Joseph&#x27;s sister, and Shechem, born of an illicit union, described as either premarital sex or rape, depending on the narrative. A later-date apocryphal publication written in Greek, believed to be a Christian document, called &quot;Joseph and Aseneth&quot;, supposedly details their relationship and their 48-year long reign over Egypt; in it, Asenath weds Joseph, whose brothers Dan and Gad plot to kill him for the sake of Pharaoh&#x27;s son, who wants Asenath to be his wife, only for their efforts to be thwarted by Joseph&#x27;s younger brother Benjamin.

== Depictions ==
== Veneration ==
Asenath is venerated in Catholic Church as a saint. Her feast day is 13 December.

<doc id="624098" wikidata="Q2295906" url="?curid=624098" title="Pogo oscillation">
<text>Pogo oscillation is a self-excited vibration in liquid-propellant rocket engines caused by combustion instability. The unstable combustion results in variations of engine thrust, causing variations of acceleration on the vehicle&#x27;s flexible structure, which in turn cause variations in propellant pressure and flow rate, closing the self-excitation cycle. The name is a metaphor comparing the longitudinal vibration to the bouncing of a pogo stick. Pogo oscillation places stress on the frame of the vehicle, which in severe cases can be dangerous. 

== Origin ==

NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight George Mueller explained Apollo 6&#x27;s pogo oscillation to a congressional hearing:

In general, pogo oscillation occurs when a surge in combustion chamber pressure increases back pressure against the fuel coming into the engine. This reduces fuel flow and thus chamber pressure. The reduced chamber pressure in turn reduces back pressure at the pump, causing more fuel to come in and repeating the cycle. In this way, a rocket engine experiencing pogo oscillations is conceptually operating somewhat like a pulsejet or pulse detonation engine. If the pulse cycle happens to match a resonance frequency of the rocket then dangerous oscillations can occur through positive feedback, which can, in extreme cases, tear the vehicle apart. Other situations that can induce fuel pressure fluctuations include flexing of fuel pipes.

Pogo oscillation plagued the Titan II first stage during its development, which delayed man-rating the rocket for the Gemini program. The Saturn V first stage (S-IC) experienced severe pogo oscillation on the flight of Apollo 6, which damaged the S-II and S-IVB stages above and likely would have triggered an abort if the flight had carried a crew. The second stage (S-II) had less intense pogo on other flights. The oscillations during Apollo 13&#x27;s ascent caused the center engine to shut down about two minutes earlier than planned. The loss in thrust was compensated by longer burns from the second and third stages.

== Hazard ==
If the oscillation is left unchecked, failures can result. One case occurred in the middle J-2 engine of the second stage, S-II, of the Apollo 13 lunar mission in 1970. In this case, the engine shut down before the oscillations could cause damage to the vehicle. Later events in this mission (an oxygen tank exploded two days later) overshadowed the pogo problem. Pogo also had been experienced in the S-IC first stage of the uncrewed Apollo 6 test flight in 1968. One of the Soviet Union&#x27;s N1-L3 rocket test flights suffered pogo oscillations in the first stage on February 21, 1969. The launch vehicle reached initial engine cutoff, but exploded 107 seconds after liftoff and disintegrated. There are other cases during uncrewed launches in the 1950s and 1960s where the pogo effect caused catastrophic launch failures, such as the first Soviet spacecraft to the moon Luna E-1 No.1 and Luna E-1 No.2 in September and October 1958.

Modern vibration analysis methods can account for the pogo oscillation to ensure that it is far away from the vehicle&#x27;s resonant frequencies. Suppression methods include damping mechanisms or bellows in propellant lines. The Space Shuttle main engines each had a damper in the LOX line, but not in the hydrogen fuel line.

<doc id="624099" wikidata="Q1503044" url="?curid=624099" title="Geoffrey Rufus">
<text>Geoffrey Rufus, also called Galfrid Rufus (died 1141) was a medieval Bishop of Durham and Lord Chancellor of England.

==Life==

Rufus&#x27; parentage and upbringing is unknown. The origin of the nickname &quot;Rufus&quot; has not been discovered either. He was a royal clerk before being named the tenth Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper of England, from 1123 to 1133. Geoffrey had also worked for the previous chancellor Ranulf. He may have started his career as a clerk for Roger of Salisbury, King Henry I of England&#x27;s chief minister, for he first appears as a witness to a charter of Roger&#x27;s in 1114. From charter evidence, it appears that Rufus was often in England, even when King Henry was in Normandy. In the Pipe Roll of 1130, he had custody of more royal land than any other official. After Geoffrey became a bishop, the king chose to keep the office of chancellor vacant until the king&#x27;s death. The functions of the office were performed by the head of the &quot;scriptorium&quot;, Robert de Sigello.

Rufus was nominated to the see of Durham about 14 May 1133, and consecrated on 6 August 1133. He was enthroned on 10 August 1133. The see had been vacant since 1128. Geoffrey at first quarrelled with his cathedral chapter, but peace was restored when the bishop allowed the monks their privileges. Geoffrey also was a benefactor to Newminster Abbey. During Rufus&#x27; episcopate the chapterhouse at Durham was completed. Rufus also employed as a clerk William Cumin, who after Rufus&#x27; death conspired with King David I of Scotland to seize the see of Durham.

When King Stephen took the throne at the death of King Henry, Rufus acknowledged Stephen as king, but did not attend the royal court often. In 1136, a peace treaty between King David and King Stephen was signed at Durham, but in 1138 Rufus&#x27; castle of Norham surrendered to King David, an act that brought condemnation to the bishop for failing to defend the castle adequately. Geoffrey, however, refused David&#x27;s offer to return Norham to Geoffrey in return for repudiating Stephen. In retaliation, Norham was destroyed. Geoffrey does not seem to have supported either side at the Battle of the Standard in August 1138. At the end of Rufus&#x27; life, because of King David&#x27;s invasion of northern England in support of the Empress Matilda, most of the diocese was under the control of the Scottish king.

Rufus died on 6 May 1141. Rufus was married, and had at least one daughter, who married Robert of Amundeville. His son Geoffrey seems not to have been involved in politics, although he held an estate in Dorset of 18 and a half hides. His grave was identified and excavated in the 19th century inside Durham Chapter House.

<doc id="624117" wikidata="Q1333903" url="?curid=624117" title="Palmer Station">
<text>Palmer Station is a United States research station in Antarctica located on Anvers island (aka Antwerp Island), the only U.S. station on the continent located north of the Antarctic Circle. Initial construction of the station finished in 1968. The station, like the other U.S. Antarctic stations, is operated by the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) of the National Science Foundation. The base is much smaller than the others, with about 40 staff, and is focused on marine and biology research such as seabirds and plankton.

The base is about as distant from the equator as Fairbanks, Alaska in the northern hemisphere, whereas Palmer is in the southern hemisphere.

== Description ==

The station is named for Nathaniel B. Palmer, usually recognized as the first American to see Antarctica. The maximum population that Palmer Station can accommodate is 46 people. The normal austral summer contingent varies, but it is generally around 44 people. Palmer is staffed year-round; however, the population drops to around 19 people for winter maintenance after the conclusion of the summer research season. There are science labs located in the Bio-Lab building (pictured), the other main building is GWR (Garage, Warehouse, and Recreation). Webcam images of the station and a penguin colony on nearby Torgersen Island are available at the station&#x27;s web site.

The facility is the second Palmer Station; &quot;Old Palmer&quot; was about a mile to the northwest adjacent to the site of the British Antarctic Survey &quot;Base N&quot;, built in the mid-fifties. The site is on what is now known as Amsler Island. Old Palmer was built about 1965, and served as a base for those building &quot;new&quot; Palmer, which opened in 1968. Old Palmer was designated as an emergency refuge for the new station in case of disaster, though this perceived need disappeared over time. It was dismantled and removed from the Antarctic as part of the National Science Foundation&#x27;s environmental cleanup efforts in the early 1990s.

Most of the station&#x27;s personnel are seasonal employees of the U.S. Antarctic Program&#x27;s main support contractor, Leidos. The summer support staff is usually 24 people. Previous main support contractors were Raytheon Polar Services, Holmes and Narver of Orange, California, ITT Antarctic Services of Paramus, New Jersey, and Antarctic Support Associates of Englewood, Colorado. Over time many support staff have worked for two or more of these firms.

The base is a few days away from Chile by boat across the drake passage, and does not have an airstrip. The station is usually visited once a month for resupply and staff changes.

== Science ==

Palmer Station is located at 64.77°S, 64.05°W. The majority of the science research conducted at Palmer Station revolves around marine biology. The station also houses year-round monitoring equipment for global seismic, atmospheric, and UV-monitoring networks, as well as a site for the study of heliophysics. Palmer also hosts a radio receiver that studies lightning over the Western Hemisphere.

Other research was conducted by the RV Laurence M. Gould and continues to be conducted by the RVIB Nathaniel B. Palmer. Science cruises cover physical oceanography, marine geology, and marine biology. The ship also carries field parties to sites around the Antarctic Peninsula to study glaciology, geology, and paleontology.

The USAP has a science planning summary for each year at Palmer Station.

In 2005, a research team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of Southern Mississippi mapped the nearby ocean floor.

In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began the staff noted they felt protected from the spreading virus, but some were eager to return home to help.

Zodiac boats are used to support the study of marine science at Palmer station.

Palmer Station has been used for science education projects, and, for example, did a group video call to a high school science class to teach about the facilities&#x27; research in 2023.

Some of the areas of scientific study at Palmer Station include zooplankton, phytoplankton, microbial ecology, biochemistry, penguins, and other seabirds.

== Life and culture ==

Employees at the station have a variety of jobs, but because of the smaller staff some jobs like kitchen duty are also spread out. Jobs include research, janitor, welding, carpentry, computer, lineman, and others. Although isolated from the rest of the world for months at time, the base itself is highly social and difficult for introverts, with one comparing the atmosphere at Palmer to a college dorm or summer camp. Staff usually work 9 hour days 6 days a week, and usually have more than one job.

== Climate ==
The Köppen Climate Classification for Palmer Station is a tundra climate (ET). Due to its northern location within Antarctica and proximity to the coast, the temperatures moderate more than interior climates. Winters are generally cold and subzero, while summers are chilly, but regularly rise to temperatures above freezing. The average temperature for the year in Palmer Station is 28.8 °F (-1.8 °C). The warmest month, on average, is January. The coldest month is August.

== Supply and transport ==
Palmer Station was re-supplied by the R/V &quot;Laurence M. Gould&quot;, a ship with an ice-strengthened hull that made routine science research cruises around the peninsula. The R/V &quot;Nathaniel B. Palmer&quot;, the United States Antarctic Program&#x27;s other research vessel, has also made port calls to Palmer Station — Hero Inlet, where the pier is located, was previously too shallow for the Palmer to dock at the station, though after a pier improvement/replacement finished in 2022 docking is now done routinely. Both ships are staffed and leased to the USAP by Edison Chouest Offshore.

Hero Inlet is named for the R/V &quot;Hero&quot;, a 125-foot wooden trawler-type vessel built to conduct research and supply Palmer Station from ports in Argentina and Chile. The &quot;Hero&quot; was owned by the National Science Foundation and built in 1968 by the Harvey Gamage shipyard in Maine. Palmer Station is located on Gamage Point, named for the shipbuilder. Other people believe that Hero Inlet is named after Capt. Nathaniel Palmer&#x27;s 47 foot sloop, Hero, that he was sailing when he first sighted Antarctica.

After years of service, the &quot;Hero&quot; was retired in 1984 and replaced by the R/V &quot;Polar Duke&quot;, a larger and more modern ice-strengthened vessel under charter from Rieber Shipping, based in Bergen, Norway. The &quot;Duke&quot; was replaced by the R/V &quot;Laurence M. Gould&quot; in 1997.

There is no routine air access to Palmer. Over the years, small ski-equipped aircraft have occasionally landed on the glacier to the east of the station.

USAP participants traveled aboard the &quot;Laurence M. Gould&quot; from &quot;Punta Arenas, Chile&quot;. The course followed the Straits of Magellan to the east, then south along the coast of Argentina, past Cape Horn, then directly south across the Drake Passage and on to Anvers Island. The entire journey usually took four days; however, sea ice and storms could slow the journey down.

== In popular culture ==
The 1980 Japanese film &quot;Fukkatsu no hi&quot; (Day of Resurrection/Virus) revolves around Palmer Station as the gathering place for humanity&#x27;s last survivors of a deadly virus. The film stars George Kennedy as Admiral Conway, the station&#x27;s commanding officer and features Glenn Ford as the President of the United States. Much of the footage for the film was shot in the vicinity of Palmer Station, though none was actually filmed at the station. Although the actual station can accommodate fewer than 50 people, the station depicted in the film housed several hundred.

<text>Peter Folger (December 26, 1905 – August 27, 1980) was an American coffee heir, socialite, and member of the prominent United States Folger family. He was also the longtime chairman of the board and president of the Folgers Coffee Company. He was the son of James Athearn Folger, Jr. (born c. 1864) and wife Clare Luning and paternal grandson of founder J. A. Folger, and the father of Abigail Folger, who was killed in the notorious Tate–LaBianca murders in 1969 at the age of 25.

==Early life==
Born and raised in California to James Athern Folger Jr. and Clara Eugenia Luning, Folger studied business and graduated from Yale University where he was an athlete on their football, track and field, and polo teams. Peter Folger later served in World War II as a Marine Major.

==Business==

In 1963, after having helped to build the family firm into the third largest coffee wholesaler in the United States, Folger sold the company to Procter &amp; Gamble for 1,650,000 shares of P&amp;G common stock. However, he and the Folger family continued to operate Folgers as a P&amp;G subsidiary.

==Personal life==
He married twice, first to Inés Mejía (1907–2007), the daughter of Encarnacion Mejía, the consul general for El Salvador, and wife Gertrude Guirola, sister of Edwin Mejía (b. 1897), and member of a prestigious California land grant family hailing from San Salvador. They went on to have two children, Abigail Anne (b. 1943) and Peter Jr. (b. 1945). Inés filed for divorce which was granted in 1952. They shared joint custody of their two children.

On June 30, 1960, Peter married his secretary Beverly Mater (b. 1935). They had one daughter together, Elizabeth, in January 1961. Peter and Beverly lived with their daughter at the Folger mansion located in Woodside, California until 1974 when they moved to a newly built home on Roberta Drive. The murder of his eldest daughter, Abigail Anne, in Los Angeles, California, on August 9, 1969, was said to have lessened Peter&#x27;s desire to continue living at the Woodside estate, where she grew up.

==Death==
Folger died from prostate cancer at his home in Woodside, California, at the age of 74 on August 27, 1980, and was buried in the Folger family plot at Mountain View Cemetery, in Oakland, California. He was survived by his wife, Beverly, who did not remarry.

<doc id="624121" wikidata="Q3520351" url="?curid=624121" title="CTV Comedy Channel">
<text>CTV Comedy Channel (often shortened to CTV Comedy) is a Canadian English-language discretionary specialty channel owned by BCE Inc. subsidiary Bell Media which focuses primarily on comedy programming and operates two time-shifted feeds, running on Eastern and Pacific Time Zone schedules.

The channel first launched on October 17, 1997 as The Comedy Network by a consortium of Baton Broadcasting, Shaw Communications, Astral Media and Les Films Rozon. Through various acquisitions over the years, the network is solely owned by Bell since 2001.

CTV Comedy Channel originally sourced most of its programming from the U.S.-based cable network Comedy Central. In the years since the channel&#x27;s inception, and with the eventual shuttering of its sister channel in 2019, the network would move some of its programming from the latter to sister channel Much before rebranding to its current name on September 12, 2019.

==History==

In September 1996, 1155636 Ontario Inc. (a company majority controlled by Baton Broadcasting, with the remaining interests held by Shaw Cable and Astral Broadcasting.) was granted a television broadcasting license by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The channel launched on October 17, 1997 as The Comedy Network, and used the slogan &quot;Time well wasted&quot;, a parody of the slogan of U.S. channel A&amp;E&#x27;s at the time, &quot;Time well spent&quot;.

Through various acquisitions over the years, Shaw, Astral and Les Films Rozon sold their interest in the service to Baton, which became Bell Globemedia in 2001, and renamed CTVglobemedia in 2007. BCE gained control of The Comedy Network on April 1, 2011, through its takeover of CTVglobemedia, in effective changing the company&#x27;s name to Bell Media.
Over the years, the channel has gone through multiple rebrands; from 2001 to 2005, the logo was given a &quot;crudely drawn&quot; look; the logo&#x27;s colors were removed, leaving the logo black (although the logo&#x27;s colors were still seen on the channel&#x27;s website). In 2005, the channel&#x27;s logo was changed from 2D to 3D; the logo&#x27;s colors were brought back. On November 1, 2011, The Comedy Network was relaunched with a new look, consisting a new simplified logo and revamped on-air presentation. Their longtime slogan was also retired on this date.

On July 12, 2012, The Comedy Network launched a high-definition simulcast feed available through all major TV providers.

In August 2013, the CRTC denied an amendment to The Comedy Network&#x27;s license, which would have reduced the amount of Canadian-produced content the network would have been required to air monthly, increase the amount of animated programming it could air from 10% of its lineup per day to 20% per month, and allow it to air films that were not Canadian-made. Bell argued that the network was at a disadvantage against BiteTV and Teletoon, because Comedy was unable to give its animated acquisitions a larger amount of exposure (such as marathons) due to the restriction. The CRTC rejected its arguments in response to complaints by the two networks cited and other unions, due to their differing natures of service and because Bell&#x27;s proposed changes were intended primarily to decrease the amount of Canadian content it airs in favour of more U.S.-originated programming. By September 2013, The Comedy Network had moved a number of acquired Comedy Central programs to its sister channel Much.

Further changes to The Comedy Network&#x27;s schedule occurred in the 2017–18 season, with the network aligning its primetime lineup with reruns of sitcoms (such as &quot;Friends&quot;) to target a wider range of viewers (including women), and provide a stronger lead-in to its first-run programs later in the night.

On June 7, 2018, during the CTV upfronts, it was announced that The Comedy Network would eventually rebrand as &quot;CTV Comedy&quot;, as part of a realignment of several Bell Media channels under the CTV name. On June 8, 2019, it was revealed The Comedy Network would relaunch as CTV Comedy Channel on September 12, 2019.

==Programming==

CTV Comedy Channel primarily airs sitcoms and stand-up comedy programming (including anthologies and specials), with much of the latter coming from the channel&#x27;s association with the Montreal-based Just for Laughs comedy festival. The network also produces its own original programming, with several series (such as &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot;, &quot;Odd Job Jack&quot; and &quot;Kevin Spencer&quot;) developing cult followings and loyal fan-bases. &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot;, &quot;Comedy Now!&quot;, &quot;The Gavin Crawford Show&quot;, and several other Comedy original series have gone on to win Canadian Comedy Awards, including CTV&#x27;s &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, which has also won six Gemini Award wins, seven Leo Award wins, and an International Emmy nomination. The channel subsequently produced a continuation of &quot;Corner Gas&quot; as an adult animation series, &quot;Corner Gas Animated&quot;.

The network has historically had a relationship with Paramount Global-owned Comedy Central in the U.S. In June 2007, Comedy&#x27;s parent company (then known as CTVglobemedia) announced a deal for exclusive Canadian rights to the entire Comedy Central library of past and present programs on all electronic platforms, under a multi-year agreement with Viacom. For several years, Canadians attempting to visit Comedy Central websites were redirected to the Comedy Network&#x27;s website. Conversely, American IP addresses trying to link to the Comedy Network page were redirected to Comedy Central&#x27;s page.

===Comedy Gold===

On August 2, 2010, TV Land Canada was rebranded as Comedy Gold, turning the channel into an offshoot of The Comedy Network. Comedy Gold originally focused primarily on sitcoms from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. On July 24, 2019, a representative of Bell Support revealed that Comedy Gold would be shutting down anywhere between August 30 and September 1; it did so on the latter date. Prior to Comedy Gold&#x27;s shuttering, on August 28, 2019, Wow Unlimited Media revealed that they would have completed their acquisition of Comedy Gold&#x27;s broadcast license on August 30, 2019.

===Comedy Go===
As part of Bell Media&#x27;s suite of &quot;Go&quot; apps for all its main channels, the Comedy Network launched its own app on April 15, 2014. As part of the launch, the video section on the Comedy Network website was renamed after the app.

Although the channel renamed to CTV Comedy Channel on September 12, 2019, the Comedy Go name was still used until Comedy Go was subsumed into the main CTV app in July 2020.

<text>Control logic is a key part of a software program that controls the operations of the program. The control logic responds to commands from the user, and it also acts on its own to perform automated tasks that have been structured into the program.

Control logic can be modeled using a state diagram, which is a form of hierarchical state machine. These state diagrams can also be combined with flow charts to provide a set of computational semantics for describing complex control logic. This mix of state diagrams and flow charts is illustrated in the figure on the right, which shows the control logic for a simple stopwatch. The control logic takes in commands from the user, as represented by the event named “START”, but also has automatic recurring sample time events, as represented by the event named “TIC”.

<doc id="624145" wikidata="Q15537832" url="?curid=624145" title="Oxygen (Canadian TV channel)">
<text>Oxygen (branded as Oxygen True Crime) is a Canadian discretionary service owned by Bell Media. Based of the U.S. cable network of the same name, the channel focuses on true crime programming, including original productions and imports from its U.S. counterpart.

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001 as a Canadian version of [[Court TV]], by Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Ltd., which was then owned by CHUM Limited, although the U.S. Court TV channel became available in Canada through cable and satellite providers as a foreign channel approved by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 1997. CHUM was acquired by CTVglobemedia in 2007. 

Two years after its U.S. counterpart was relaunched as TruTV, Court TV was relaunched as [[Investigation Discovery]] on August 30, 2010, as part of a licensing arrangement between CTVglobemedia and Discovery Communications. On January 1, 2025, after Bell lost its rights to Warner Bros. Discovery factual and lifestyle brands to Rogers Sports &amp; Media, the channel relaunched as Oxygen as part of a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal, maintaining its true crime format. Rogers concurrently launched a new iteration of ID the same day.

== History ==
=== As CourtTV Canada ===
In November 2000, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta, a company majority owned by CHUM Limited with a 60% ownership and owners of Access as well access now ctv 2 Alberta today, was granted permission by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to launch a television channel called &quot;The Law &amp; Order Channel&quot;, described as &quot;a national English-language Category 2 specialty television service that will feature entertainment programming about police, law, the courts, emergency and medical response teams, disaster and relief operations featuring people and organizations that uphold law and order in our society.&quot;

The channel was launched on September 7, 2001 as Court TV Canada. The channel replaced the U.S. Court TV service, which was available on many television service providers throughout Canada as an eligible foreign service from 1997.
On February 15, 2005, CHUM completed the purchase of the remaining interest in LSTA, bringing its ownership to 100%. A year later, in July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later renamed CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion, included in the sale was LSTA and its interest in CourtTV Canada. The sale and was approved by the CRTC in June 2007, and the transaction was completed on June 22, 2007. In 2008, LSTA (then known as Access Media Group) was wound up into CTV Limited (the renamed CHUM Limited).

=== As Investigation Discovery ===

The original CourtTV was relaunched as TruTV in 2008, though the Canadian version continued to use the CourtTV branding. On August 30, 2010, CTV announced a new licensing agreement with Discovery Communications, under which Court TV Canada would be rebranded as a Canadian version of Discovery&#x27;s true crime brand Investigation Discovery. It is the only Discovery-branded channel operated by Bell Media that neither Discovery, nor ESPN Inc. (via CTV Specialty Television, Inc.), holds an ownership stake in.

On September 10, 2010, Bell Canada (a minority shareholder in CTVglobemedia) announced that it planned to acquire 100% interest in CTVglobemedia for a total debt and equity transaction cost of CAD$3.2 billion. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 7, 2011, and was finalized on April 1 of that year, on which CTVglobemedia was rebranded Bell Media.

On June 17, 2011, Bell Media announced plans to launch a high definition simulcast feed of Investigation Discovery, titled Investigation Discovery HD, by the end of the year. The HD feed was launched on December 15, 2011 on Bell Fibe TV and later on Telus Optik TV; The HD feed later began to be carried on Bell Satellite TV on December 13, 2012, then Bell Aliant and NorthernTel in the mid-2010s. The HD feed was added to Shaw Direct&#x27;s lineup on October 16, 2018. It is yet to be launched on Shaw Cable and some smaller providers.

=== As Oxygen ===
In June 2024, Rogers Sports &amp; Media announced that it had acquired the rights to all Warner Bros. Discovery lifestyle and factual television brands in Canada beginning January 1, 2025. Rogers stated that it would concurrently launch a new Investigation Discovery linear channel on that date.

On October 17, 2024, Bell Media announced a licensing agreement with NBCUniversal to relaunch two of its former Discovery-branded channels, with ID becoming a Canadian version of NBCU&#x27;s true crime brand Oxygen on January 1, 2025. The relaunched channel will retain its existing Canadian original programming, but with Oxygen library programs replacing programs acquired from Investigation Discovery. 

Oxygen marks Bell&#x27;s third active channel partnership with NBCUniversal, following the relaunch of Star! as E! in 2010, and the concurrent relaunch of Discovery Channel as USA Network in 2025; Comcast and Bell Media&#x27;s predecessors were also co-owners of OLN from 1997 to 2008.

==Programming==
The channel primarily airs true crime programming sourced from its U.S. parent network (such as &quot;Dateline&quot;, &quot;The Real Murders of...,&quot; and &quot;Snapped)&quot;. It has also commissioned several original Canadian productions, such as &quot;Fear Thy Neighbor&quot; (a co-production with French-language sister network Investigation and the U.S. Investigation Discovery) and &quot;Forensic Factor&quot;.

Under the former incarnation as Court TV Canada, this channel also aired crime-themed programs such as true crime documentary series, legal analysis talk shows, and live news coverage of prominent criminal cases. This format is continued to be maintained after its relaunch as Investigation Discovery in 2010 and the retirement of the genre protection rules by the CRTC in 2015 while its U.S. counterpart which was rebranded as TruTV which has since then shifted towards comedy and sports programming throughout the late 2010s; Court TV would be revived as a over the air channel by Scripps Networks in 2019.

<doc id="624150" wikidata="Q3188085" url="?curid=624150" title="Trier of fact">
<text>In law, a trier of fact or finder of fact is a person or group who determines disputed issues of fact in a legal proceeding (usually a trial) and how relevant they are to deciding its outcome. To determine a fact is to decide, from the evidence presented, whether something existed or some event occurred.

The factfinder differs by the type of proceeding. In a jury trial, it is the jury; in a non-jury trial, the judge is both the factfinder and the trier of law. In administrative proceedings, the factfinder may be a hearing officer or a hearing body.

==Juries==

In a jury trial, a jury is the trier of fact. The jury finds the facts and applies them to the relevant statute or law it is instructed by the judge to use to reach its verdict. Thus, in a jury trial, the jury makes the findings of fact while the judge makes legal rulings as to what evidence will be heard by the jury and what legal framework governs the case. Jurors are instructed to follow the law as given by the judge strictly but are in no way obligated to do so. This sometimes leads to jury nullification, where the jury&#x27;s verdict differs from the law.

In Anglo-American–based legal systems, a finding of fact made by the jury is not appealable unless clearly wrong to any reasonable person. This principle is enshrined in the Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides that &quot;no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law&quot;.

==Judges==
In a bench trial, judges are professional triers of fact. In a bench trial, the judge makes findings of fact and rulings of law. The findings of a judge of first instance are not normally disturbed by an appellate court.

==Administrative law judges==
In the U.S., an administrative law judge (ALJ) both presides over trials (and makes rulings of law) and adjudicates the claims or disputes (in other words, ALJ-controlled proceedings are bench trials) involving administrative law, but ALJs are not part of an independent judiciary.

==Mixed systems==
In mixed systems, such as the judiciary of Germany, a mixture of both judges and lay judges are triers of fact.

<doc id="624152" wikidata="Q6009079" url="?curid=624152" title="In Between Evolution">
<text>In Between Evolution is the ninth studio album by the Canadian rock band the Tragically Hip. It was recorded at Studio X in Seattle and released June 29, 2004. The album debuted at number one in Canada, selling 22,500 copies in its first week. However, it got bumped off the number one spot by Avril Lavigne&#x27;s &quot; Under My Skin&quot;. &quot;In Between Evolution&quot; was certified Platinum in Canada in September 2004.

One of the major themes on the album is a response to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. &quot;Heaven Is a Better Place Today&quot; doubles as a tribute to Dan Snyder, a player for the Atlanta Thrashers hockey team who died in an automobile accident nine months before the album&#x27;s release, and for young men being sent to war.

The Hip performed a rough version of the song &quot;It Can&#x27;t be Nashville Every Night&quot; on a season-two episode of the Canadian television sitcom &quot;Corner Gas&quot;, as a local band renting out main character Brent Leroy&#x27;s garage for band practice.

<text>A blister agent (or vesicant), is a chemical compound that causes severe skin, eye and mucosal pain and irritation. They are named for their ability to cause severe chemical burns, resulting in painful water blisters on the bodies of those affected. Although the term is often used in connection with large-scale burns caused by chemical spills or chemical warfare agents, some naturally occurring substances such as cantharidin are also blister-producing agents (vesicants). Furanocoumarin, another naturally occurring substance, causes vesicant-like effects indirectly, for example, by increasing skin photosensitivity greatly. Vesicants have medical uses including wart removal but can be dangerous if even small amounts are ingested.

==Blister agents used in warfare==
Most blister agents fall into one of four groups:
* Sulfur mustards – A family of sulfur-based agents, including mustard gas.
* Nitrogen mustards – A family of agents similar to the sulfur mustards, but based on nitrogen instead of sulfur.
* Lewisite – An early blister agent that was developed, but not used, during World War I. It was effectively rendered obsolete with the development of British anti-Lewisite in the 1940s.
* Phosgene oxime – Occasionally included among the blister agents, although it is more properly termed a nettle agent (urticant).

== Effects ==
Exposure to a weaponized blister agent can cause a number of life-threatening symptoms, including:
* Severe skin, eye and mucosal pain and irritation
* Skin erythema with large fluid blisters that heal slowly and may become infected
* Tearing, conjunctivitis, corneal damage
* Mild respiratory distress to marked airway damage

All blister agents currently known are denser than air, and are readily absorbed through the eyes, lungs, and skin. Effects of the two mustard agents are typically delayed: exposure to vapors becomes evident in 4 to 6 hours, and skin exposure in 2 to 48 hours. The effects of Lewisite are immediate.

<text>The Asian Highway Network (AH), also known as the Great Asian Highway, is a cooperative project among countries in Asia and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) to improve their connectivity via highway systems, funded by G77 Gold Standards. It is one of the three pillars of the Asian Land Transport Infrastructure Development (ALTID) project, endorsed by the ESCAP commission at its 48th session in 1992, comprising Asian Highway, Trans-Asian railway (TAR) and facilitation of land transport projects.

Agreements have been signed by 32 countries to allow the highway to cross the continent and also reach to Europe. Some of the countries taking part in the highway project are India (Act East policy), Sri Lanka, Pakistan, China, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Nepal and Bangladesh. Most of the funding comes from the larger, more advanced Asian nations such as China, South Korea and Singapore as well as international agencies such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

The project aims to make maximum use of the continent&#x27;s existing highways to avoid the construction of newer ones, except in cases where missing routes necessitate their construction. &quot;Project Monitor&quot;, an Asian infrastructure news website, has commented that &quot;early beneficiaries of the Asian Highway project are the planners within the national land transport department of the participating countries [since] it assists them in planning the most cost-effective and efficient routes to promote domestic and international trade. Non-coastal areas, which are often negligible, are the other beneficiaries.&quot;

However, in the mid-2000s some transportation experts were skeptical about the viability of the project given the economic and political climate in both South and Southeast Asia.

==History==
The AH project was initiated by the United Nations in 1959 with the aim of promoting the development of international road transport in the region. During the first phase of the project (1960–1970) considerable progress was achieved, however, progress slowed down when financial assistance was suspended in 1975.

ESCAP has conducted several projects in cooperation with AH member countries step by step after the endorsement of ALTID in 1992.

The Intergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network (IGA) was adopted on February 28,1997 by the Intergovernmental Meeting ; 37000 kilometers, and was adopted on November 18, 2003, by the Intergovernmental Meeting; the IGA includes Annex I, which identifies 55 AH routes among 32 member countries totalling approximately 140,000 km (87,500 miles), and Annex II &quot;Classification and Design Standards&quot;. During the 60th session of the ESCAP Commission at Shanghai, China, in April 2004, the IGA treaty was signed by 23 countries. By 2013, 29 countries had ratified the agreement.

In 2007, British drivers Richard Meredith and Phil Colley completed the first full East to West journey of the entire highway in an Aston Martin Vantage which was later sold to raise money for UNICEF. The drive was a marketing stunt promoted by the car manufacturer.

==Implications==
The advanced highway network would provide for greater trade and social interactions between Asian countries, including personal contacts, project capitalizations, connections of major container terminals with transportation points, and promotion of tourism via the new roadways. Infrastructure consultant Om Prakash noted that, &quot;It&#x27;s an excellent step taken by ESCAP to gather all the Asian countries under one crown but the problem with this project is political disputes between some countries, notably Pakistan and Myanmar, which is delaying the project.&quot;

==Future development plans==
Route AH1 is proposed to extend from Tokyo to the border with Bulgaria (EU) west of Istanbul and Edirne, passing through both Koreas, China and other countries in Southeast, Central and South Asia. The corridor is expected to improve trade links between East Asian countries, India and Russia. To complete the route, existing roads will be upgraded and new roads constructed to link the network. has been spent or committed with additional US$18 billion needed for upgrades and improvements to of highway.

==Numbering and signage==
The project new highway route numbers begin with &quot;AH&quot;, standing for &quot;Asian Highway&quot;, followed by one, two or three digits. Single-digit route numbers from 1 to 9 are assigned to major Asian Highway routes which cross more than one subregion. Two- and three-digit route numbers are assigned to indicate the routes within subregions, including those connecting to neighbouring subregions, and self-contained highway routes within the participating countries. Route numbers are printed in the Latin script and Hindu-Arabic numerals and may simply be added to existing signage, like the E-road network.

The actual design of the signs has not been standardized, only that the letters and digits are in white or black, but the color, shape and size of the sign being completely flexible. Most examples feature a blue rectangular shield with a white inscription (similar to German Autobahn signage) with further examples of white on green and black on white rectangular shields.

<text>Samuel Kirkland (December 1, 1741 – February 28, 1808) was a Presbyterian minister and missionary among the Oneida and Tuscarora peoples of central New York State. He was a long-time friend of the Oneida chief Skenandoa.

Kirkland graduated from Princeton in 1765. In 1793 as part of his missionary work with the Oneida tribe he founded a seminary, the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in Clinton, New York. The seminary admitted both white and Oneida boys. Kirkland named it in honor of Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who was a member of the first Board of Trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy. The Hamilton-Oneida Academy was chartered as Hamilton College in 1812. 

A student of the Iroquoian languages, Kirkland lived for many years with the Iroquois tribes. He helped negotiate the land purchases that New York State made from the Iroquois after the American Revolutionary War, acquiring his own land in the process.

==Early life and education==
Samuel Kirkland was born on December 1, 1741, in Norwich, Connecticut. He was educated in common schools and at Princeton (then the College of New Jersey), where he graduated in 1765. He was soon ordained as a Presbyterian minister and wanted to proselytize Native Americans.

==Career==
Kirkland began his missionary work as a protégé of Reverend Eleazar Wheelock in Connecticut at his Moor&#x27;s Indian Charity School (later relocated to New Hampshire as Dartmouth College). Kirkland met Joseph Brant, a Mohawk who became a war leader against the rebels during the American Revolutionary War while at the school. Kirkland and Wheelock parted company in 1770. Kirkland moved to central New York, where he became a missionary to the Iroquois, especially the Oneida and Tuscarora located at the western end of the Mohawk River Valley. He acted as an adviser and ambassador to the Iroquois during the American Revolutionary War. At a time when four of the Six Nations allied with the British, he helped persuade the Oneida and Tuscarora to assist the American revolutionaries. 

Warfare in the Mohawk Valley caused widespread destruction in both the colonial frontier settlements and many Iroquois villages, as one side and another conducted retaliatory attacks. After the war, Kirkland maintained good relations with the Iroquois. In 1790 he was visited by the Italian explorer Paolo Andreani who reported on his observations of Kirkland and the Oneida people. Andreani noted that Kirkland had collected basic word lists of over 200 languages. He also saw how Kirkland conducted Sunday services with translated psalms. The participants were teased by other members of the tribe but the congregation was sincere and they abstained from hunting and other work on Sundays.

Kirkland played a key role in organizing purchases of lands from the Oneida on behalf of New York state, in the process securing large parcels of the Oneida land for himself and his friends. Kirkland&#x27;s assistant James Dean was present at every land cession from the Oneida to the state of New York between 1785 and 1818. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1790. Kirkland helped negotiate treaties and keep peace between the Iroquois tribes, who were relocated to smaller reservations, and whites. He is considered by many to be the peacekeeper between the Iroquois and the settlers after the war, when settlers did not sufficiently distinguish between former allies and those nations who had been enemies and responsible for destruction. In addition, the wave of migration from New England brought many Yankees eager to acquire land, and they encroached on the Iroquois both before and after land purchases by the state.

Long interested in education, in 1793 Kirkland founded the Hamilton-Oneida Academy as a boys&#x27; school in central New York to meet demand from the many new European-American settlements. (This later developed as Hamilton College.) It was a time of the development of boys&#x27; schools throughout the state, followed in the nineteenth century by girls&#x27; schools.

==Marriage and family==
On September 20, 1769, Samuel Kirkland married Jerusha Bingham (1743–1788) in Windham, Connecticut. They had several children, who grew up to have leadership positions with their families and in society. Their son, John Thornton Kirkland (1770–1840) served as President of Harvard College from 1810 to 1828. Their eldest daughter, Jerusha Kirkland, (1776–1862) married John Hosmer Lothrop (1769–1829).

The Kirklands&#x27; granddaughter Frances Eliza Lothrop (1809–1893) married John Hiram Lathrop (1799–1866). A graduate of Yale with a law degree, he became a teacher and, in 1840, the first President of the University of Missouri at Columbia. The couple were honored by a large memorial stained glass window in Grace and Holy Trinity Cathedral in Kansas City, Missouri, where descendants of both the Lathrops and the Kirklands are members of the Parish.

<text>Sir Ellis Emmanuel Innocent Clarke (28 December 191730 December 2010) was the first President of Trinidad and Tobago and the second and last Governor-General. He was one of the main architects of Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s 1962 Independence constitution.

==Early life==

Clarke attended Saint Mary&#x27;s College, winning an Island Scholarship in Mathematics in 1938. Ellis Clarke attended University College London of the University of London, where he received a Bachelor of Law degree and was called to the bar at Gray&#x27;s Inn. He returned to Port of Spain in 1941, taking up private practice there.

==Political career==

He served as Solicitor-General from 1954 to 1956, Deputy Colonial Secretary 1956–57, and Attorney General 1957–62. After Independence in 1962 he served as Ambassador to the United States, Canada and Mexico, and Permanent Representative to the United Nations. At the time, he participated in the 2nd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cairo in 1964.

In 1972 he succeeded Sir Solomon Hochoy as Governor General. When Trinidad and Tobago became a republic in 1976, Clarke was unanimously elected the country&#x27;s first President by the electoral college, which comprised the elected members of both Houses of Parliament. He was re-elected by the People&#x27;s National Movement-controlled electoral college and completed his second term in 1987. Disagreements with the new National Alliance for Reconstruction government resulted in Clarke&#x27;s decision not to seek a third term. He was succeeded by Noor Hassanali.

Clarke was invested as a Companion of St Michael and St George by Queen Elizabeth II in 1960 and was awarded a knighthood as a Knight Grand Cross of that order in 1972. Although he ceased to use the title &quot;Sir&quot; after the country became a republic, after retirement from the presidency he re-adopted his title and was generally referred to as &quot;Former President, Sir Ellis Clarke&quot; or Sir Ellis.

He was married to Lady Ermyntrude Clarke (1921–2002) for almost fifty years. They had three children: Peter Ellis Clarke (married to Suzanne Traboulay, a former beauty queen), Margaret-Ann (married to Gordon Fisken) and Richard (who died as a young child).

Ellis Clarke was one of six experts worldwide asked to submit reports to Australia&#x27;s Republic Advisory Committee in 1993 detailing his country&#x27;s experience in moving from a constitutional monarchy to a republic.

==Death and funerals==

On 24 November 2010, Clarke suffered a massive stroke. He died on 30 December 2010, two days after his 93rd birthday. Clarke was laid to rest on 7 January 2011. A private funeral was held at the Church of the Assumption on Maraval Road in Port of Spain. Both his living children as well as his four grandsons gave tributes. Following the private funeral, a state funeral was held at the National Academy for the Performing Arts Building situated at the Queens Park Savannah. It was an inter-religious celebration at which the President, Prime Minister and Chief Justice paid tributes. In attendance were members of Parliament, senators, members of the diplomatic corps, and foreign heads of state and dignitaries. A procession through Port of Spain followed the service. Sir Ellis&#x27; coffin, draped in a Trinidad and Tobago flag, was set atop a cannon and pulled by a military vehicle. The procession concluded at Lapeyrouse Cemetery, where he was buried at the Clarke family plot, which burial was attended by family and friends.

<doc id="624172" wikidata="Q4748011" url="?curid=624172" title="Amoy Gardens">
<text>Amoy Gardens () is a private housing estate in the Jordan Valley area of Kowloon, Hong Kong completed from 1981 to 1987. It was the most seriously affected location during the 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), with over 300 people infected there.

==Features==
Amoy Gardens comprises 19 blocks, lettered A to S, with heights ranging from 30 to 40 floors. The eight blocks A-H are 33 storeys/105 m high, and situated on a podium 14 m high, which houses a commercial centre. These eight blocks have eight flats per floor arranged in a cruciform shape. Each arm of the cruciform contains two apartments. There is a shopping arcade (Amoy Plaza) as well as a food square within the Amoy Gardens estate.

==History==
===Development===
The site was purchased by Amoy Canning in the 1920s for use as a factory. Amoy put the site of approximately up for auction in March 1977, intending to move their manufacturing operations elsewhere in stages. The auction failed as the reserve price was not reached. Subsequently, Hang Lung Development signed an agreement to purchase the site in April 1977 for about HK$200 million. Under the agreement, Amoy would take a share of the profits from the site&#x27;s redevelopment.

The estate was built in four phases. The construction contract for the estate&#x27;s first phase, comprising seven residential blocks (blocks A-G) and retail space, was awarded to Hong Kong contractor Shui On Construction on 18 October 1979. The first phase was completed in 1981, while the final phase was completed in 1987.

===SARS outbreak===

Toward the end of March 2003, an outbreak of SARS occurred among residents of Amoy Gardens. By 15 April 2003, there had been a total of 321 cases of SARS in the estate. A concentration of cases was recorded in block E, accounting for 41% of the cumulative total. Block C (15%), block B (13%) and block D (13%) recorded the second, third and fourth highest incidence of SARS infections. The other cases (18%) were scattered in 11 other blocks. Most of the initial 107 patients from Block E lived in flats that were vertically arranged.

All residents were subsequently moved to Lei Yue Mun and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village for isolation. In mid-2003, authorities found that the design of bathroom floor drains lacked a replenishment system to keep the water traps filled, allowing virus-laden aerosols to seep into bathrooms, exacerbated by the draw of bathroom exhaust fans. These were among the factors that contributed to the rapid spread of SARS in that complex. The estate was decontaminated and the residents were able to return. Later, the complex was retrofitted with an auxiliary floor drainage system that included fresh water interlocks to prevent regurgitation of sewer gases.

==Demographics==
According to the 2016 by-census, Amoy Gardens had a population of 10,721. The median age was 37.7 and the majority of residents (95.6 per cent) were of Chinese ethnicity. The average household comprised 2.4 persons. The median monthly household income of all households was HK$34,000.

==Transportation==
Amoy Gardens is served by the Kowloon Bay station of the MTR metro system. In addition, the estate is served by numerous bus routes.

==Education==
Amoy Gardens is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 46. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money); no government primary schools are in this net.

<doc id="624176" wikidata="Q676426" url="?curid=624176" title="Rockit (instrumental)">
<text>&quot;Rockit&quot; is a composition recorded by American jazz pianist Herbie Hancock and produced by Bill Laswell and Michael Beinhorn. Hancock released it as a single from his studio album &quot;Future Shock&quot; (1983). The selection was composed by Hancock, Laswell, and Beinhorn.

The track was driven by its deejay scratch style, performed primarily by DXT, and its music video created by Godley &amp; Creme, featuring the robotic art of Jim Whiting, which was put in high rotation on MTV. &quot;Rockit&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance in 1983, and it won five MTV Video Music Awards in 1984.

==Recording==
&quot;Rockit&quot; was constructed and composed during the recording process, first at BC Studio in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with additional overdubs at RPM Studios in Manhattan, then Hancock&#x27;s home studio in West Hollywood, and finally at Eldorado studio in Hollywood, Los Angeles. The production duo of Material (bassist Bill Laswell and synth player Michael Beinhorn) were based at Martin Bisi&#x27;s BC Studio, recording experimental, no wave and underground club music. Hancock&#x27;s 25-year-old manager, Tony Meilandt, approached Laswell to write a new track for Hancock, whose career needed a boost. To gauge this potential new direction for his career, Hancock accompanied Laswell to hear a set of popular club DJs including Afrika Bambaataa and D.ST spin at Roxy NYC in front of an enthusiastic crowd. Warily eyeing the crowd, which to him looked like a riot, Hancock needed more convincing by Meilandt before he contracted with Laswell&#x27;s team to deliver two tracks. Meilandt later said &quot;Herbie was very much ready&quot; to try a new kind of sound.

At BC Studios, Beinhorn used a new Oberheim DMX drum machine to lay down a basic beat, and Laswell brought in Daniel Ponce to augment this with Afro-Cuban batá drums. Ponce played the three drums one at a time during three recording passes, to make it sound like three drummers invoking a Santería spirit. Grand Mixer D.ST came to the studio with two deejay friends from his group Infinity Rappers to scratch for the track, bringing his own vinyl which included &quot;Change the Beat&quot; by Fab Five Freddy, (which had been recorded in the same studio). D.ST found an interesting portion of the 12-inch vinyl near the end– the voice of manager Roger Trilling saying &quot;Ahhh! This stuff is really fresh&quot; through the studio&#x27;s vocoder– and he scratched through that section. Trilling had been playing with the vocoder in the studio, mocking Elektra Records executive Bruce Lundvall who was in the habit of sitting back in his chair and declaring a song &quot;fresh&quot; if he liked it, without knowing that the word &quot;fresh&quot; was current in hip-hop subculture. This moment was captured on tape, and Laswell worked it into the conclusion of &quot;Change the Beat&quot;.

The 2-inch 16-track master tape containing rhythm parts and scratching needed to be transferred to 24-track 2-inch in order for Hancock to work with it at his home studio. Laswell and Bisi took the tape to RPM Studios in Greenwich Village, but instead of simply transferring the format, they added some extra sounds, especially a stab of guitar taken from a Led Zeppelin song on the album &quot;Coda&quot;. Using the repeat hold function of a Lexicon Prime Time digital delay, they attempted to capture a Led Zeppelin snare drum sound, but a moment of inattention resulted in the guitar stab, which Laswell found better suited his purpose.

Hancock first heard the work-in-progress in West Hollywood at his home studio, a former guest house in back of his main residence. Hancock determined that the track needed a melody line. Hancock, Laswell and Beinhorn composed one on the spot by humming out loud to each other. Then Hancock recorded his ideas on three different synthesizers, performing on them one at a time. When Hancock suggested performing some vocoder vocal scat, Laswell and Beinhorn said they could instead sample lyrics from a hit song, specifically the line &quot;Rock it, don&#x27;t stop it&quot; from &quot;Planet Rock&quot;, which was at that time a hit for Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force. This lyric sample produced the title &quot;Rockit&quot;.

A final recording session was convened at Eldorado Studios located at Hollywood and Vine, Hollywood, Los Angeles. To round out the turntablist sounds, D.ST flew out from New York along with his colleague Grandmaster Caz. Session engineer Dave Jerden remarked to Beinhorn that Hancock appeared hopeful about the track, but that he did not realize what he had. After the brief 90-minute session, the New York contingent went to a local stereo shop to pass the time before their flight home. Carrying a cassette tape of the final mix, they listened to &quot;Rockit&quot; on some loudspeakers at the shop, attracting the attention of children from the neighborhood who were amazed and curious. Judging their reaction, Laswell told D.ST, &quot;That&#x27;s a hit record.&quot;

==Music video==
The music video, directed by the duo of Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, featured robot-like movable sculptures (by Jim Whiting) dancing, spinning, and even walking in time to the music in a &quot;virtual house&quot; in London, England. The video garnered five MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, including Best Concept Video and Best Special Effects. Hancock himself appears, and plays keyboard, only as an image on a television receiver, which is smashed on the pavement outside the front door of the house at the end of the video. The video also won two Billboard Video Music Awards, one for most innovative video, and another for best art direction.

==Performances==
&quot;Rockit&quot; was performed at the 1985 Grammy Awards Ceremony in Los Angeles, California, in a synthesizer jam with contemporaries Howard Jones, Thomas Dolby, and Stevie Wonder.

<text>BBspot is a geek satire and humour web site founded in 2000. In 2003, the site was successful enough that webmaster Brian Briggs &quot;quit his day job&quot; and made the site his full-time vocation. BBspot is most notable for its technology news satire.

The most successful hoaxes by BBspot include an article about premium accounts on Twitter and claims about the MPAA conducting surveillance in private residences.

BBspot is a founding member of HumorFeed, a community of news satire webmasters; Briggs is also a member of the editorial board for &quot;Check Please!&quot;, a journal devoted to the serious examination of news satire and journalism.

Content updates to BBSpot ceased in November 2011, experiencing intermittent down time in the years that followed. It resumed in December 2017 with the story &quot;Valve Contracts George R. R. Martin to Complete Half-Life Story&quot;.

== Content ==
BBspot is most notable for its news satire, which mainly covers technology, Microsoft, and Hollywood. Responses from &quot;BBelievers&quot; who are fooled by the stories are posted approximately weekly. Since 2006, the site also hosts &quot;The PC Weenies&quot; cartoons by Krishna M. Sadasivam, which replaces the FuzzyLogic cartoons created between 2001 and 2004.

BBspot issues an award, the &quot;Technical Award of Excellence&quot;, for gadgets and technology, based on a series of obscure or superficial challenges; such as coin flips, who has the best mascot, logo or name, and the web site.

The site also contains movie trailer reviews, internet-based guffs (&quot;BBloopers&quot;), regular guest columns and other items of general interest. There is also a forum.

== Press coverage ==
Several mainstream media outlets have represented the satire on the site as real news. Fooled outlets include TechTV&#x27;s The Screen Savers show, the Discovery Channel as well as radio shows, major newspapers and books.

== Awards ==
BBspot won third place in the HumorFeed Satire News Awards twice, in 2006 for its story &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s AntiSpyware Tool Removes Internet Explorer&quot; and in 2007 for &quot;Teen Using Myspace To Lure Bands to Los Angeles&quot;. &quot;The Register&quot; named BBspot the &quot;best tech humour site&quot; in 2000.

<doc id="624187" wikidata="Q5203445" url="?curid=624187" title="D.R. &amp; Quinch">
<text>D.R. &amp; Quinch is a comic strip about two delinquent alien drop-outs. It was created by Alan Moore and Alan Davis for the British weekly comics anthology &quot;2000 AD&quot;. It first appeared in 1983. The strip was the tale of how two alien teenage students Waldo &quot;D.R.&quot; (for &quot;Diminished Responsibility&quot;) Dobbs, a scheming criminal mastermind, and Ernest Errol Quinch, his muscular purple-skinned companion in crime, have influenced Earth&#x27;s history in various anarchic ways.

==Publication history==
===Creation and concept===
&quot;D.R. and Quinch&quot; began in &quot;2000 AD&quot; as a one-off comic in the &quot;Time Twisters&quot; series titled “D.R. and Quinch Have Fun On Earth”. The characters were initially meant to only appear once but they proved so popular that they were given their own semi-regular series.

D.R. and Quinch were inspired by the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; characters &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot;. The film &quot;Animal House&quot; has also been cited as an influence. Alan Davis took visual inspiration from the cartoon style of Leo Baxendale’s &quot;Grimly Feendish&quot;. Alan Moore has described &quot;D.R. &amp; Quinch&quot; as belonging to the tradition of British teenage delinquency comics, comparable to &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; except with “a thermonuclear capacity”.

=== Later appearances ===
The pair&#x27;s last storyline, &quot;D.R. and Quinch Go to Hollywood,&quot; ran from progs 363 to 367 and is considered to be Moore and Davis&#x27;s finest &quot;D.R. and Quinch&quot; story. However, at the time, the Moore/Davis partnership was undergoing strain due to Moore refusing permission for their &quot;Captain Britain&quot; work to be reprinted. The pair&#x27;s last &quot;D.R. and Quinch&quot; work together was in the &quot;2000 AD Sci-Fi Special&quot; in 1985.

D.R. and Quinch continued to appear in &quot;2000 AD&quot; from progs 525 to 534 in the form of an advice column with readers sending in letters with personal problems solved by D.R. and Quinch in their own way. One such column was &quot;hijacked&quot; by D.R.&#x27;s girlfriend Crazy Chrissy. These later episodes were written by Jamie Delano.

In 1986 Titan Books released a collection of all &quot;D.R. and Quinch&quot; stories from &quot;2000 AD&quot; called &quot;D.R. and Quinch&#x27;s Totally Awesome Guide To Life&quot;. It became one of Titan&#x27;s best selling books in their lines of &quot;2000 AD&quot; reprints. The book went out of print several times and it has since been collected as &quot;The Complete D.R. and Quinch&quot; () in 2001.

In 2018, INDIO comics released a story, &quot;D.R. &amp; Quinch Hijack Free Comic Book Day&quot;, which was part of a &quot;2000 AD Regened&quot; all-ages comic created for Free Comic Book Day. The strip was created by Owen Michael Johnson and Colin Bell.

== Characters ==
* Waldo &quot;D.R.&quot; Dobbs — scheming criminal mastermind
* Ernest Errol Quinch — D.R.&#x27;s muscular purple-skinned companion 
* Crazy Chrissy — D.R.&#x27;s girlfriend, formerly known as Chrysoprasia, or Chirpy to her friends
* Pulger — paranoid veteran of the Ghoyogi slime jungle wars

==Reception==
&quot;D.R. &amp; Quinch&quot;&#x27;s anarchic humour was popular with its original audiences — the feature won the 1985 Eagle Award (for comics published in 1984) for Character Most Worthy of Own Title; and the supporting characters Pulger and Chrysoprasia were both nominated for Favourite Supporting Character. In addition, the first collection of stories, &quot;D.R. &amp; Quinch&#x27;s Totally Awesome Guide to Life&quot;, won the 1987 Eagle Award for Favourite Comic Album.

The series has had a strong reputation since it was first published. It stands out as something so obviously different when compared to the rest of Moore’s body of work that it is worthy of attention. It has been called the &quot;absurd, cartoony, delightfully vicious other side of &quot;Halo Jones&quot;&quot;. Writing for &quot;Time&quot;, Douglas Wolk described it as, for the majority of its run, &quot;one of the funniest comics ever&quot; and Neil Gaiman has credited it with being one of the greatest &quot;2000 AD&quot; stories.

In a later interview, however, co-creator Moore expressed discomfort with how the series exploits violence for comic effect, claiming that it has no “lasting or redeeming social value”.

<text>St. Cloud State University (SCSU) is a public university in St. Cloud, Minnesota, United States. Founded in 1869, the university is one of the largest institutions in the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. Its enrollment in 2024 was over 10,000 students and it has over 132,000 alumni.

==History==

St. Cloud State opened in 1869 as Third State Normal School. The school was one building, the Stearns House, a renovated hotel purchased by the state Legislature for $3,000. The five-member faculty was headed by Principal Ira Moore. Of the 50 original students, 40 were women. As the number of female students increased and Old Main opened in early 1874, Stearns House was completely transformed into a women&#x27;s dormitory in 1874; male students later organized a boarding club where they located a house near campus, overseen by a matron.

In 1898, the school offered a junior college curriculum. In 1914, the school dropped its secondary education program. The Legislature authorized a name change in 1921 to St. Cloud State Teachers College. In 1957, the word &quot;Teachers&quot; was dropped. The first bachelor&#x27;s degrees were awarded in 1925. Master&#x27;s degree programs were first offered in 1953.

In 1975, St. Cloud State became a university comprising five colleges and a graduate school. In 1987, men&#x27;s hockey became an NCAA Division I program. Two years later, the team moved into a new two-rink arena called today the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center (.

Applied doctoral degrees were first offered in 2007.

In 2014, the university updated its secondary logo, which features a Husky dog face. In December 2019 SCSU announced it was discontinuing the men&#x27;s football team and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf. To remain in compliance with Title IX, the university is adding a men&#x27;s soccer team.

===Ice hockey===
Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams compete in NCAA Division I. Men&#x27;s Hockey is in the NCHC, and Women&#x27;s Hockey is in the WCHA.

In the 1986–87 season, Herb Brooks, the 1980 USA men&#x27;s Olympic hockey coach, became the coach of the Huskies and helped men&#x27;s hockey attain NCAA Division I status. That season, he led the Huskies to a 25–10–1 record and a third-place trophy at the NCAA Division III Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship. He also guided efforts to build the two-rink arena, Herb Brooks National Hockey Center, that now bears his name. In 2001, the men&#x27;s team won the WCHA post-season tournament, symbolized by the Broadmoor Trophy.

In 1998, the university added a women&#x27;s hockey team at the NCAA Division I level.

Men&#x27;s Huskies Hockey has earned 19 NCAA Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Championship appearances. The team advanced to the 2013 Frozen Four. The 2012–13 team&#x27;s co-captain Drew LeBlanc was named WCHA Player of the Year and earned numerous national honors, including the Hobey Baker Award, the most prestigious award in men&#x27;s college hockey. The 2013 team also earned a share of the WCHA league title and the MacNaughton Cup. The 2014 team earned the Penrose Cup, the league title trophy for the inaugural season of the NCHC. In 2016 the team won the NCHC post-season tournament, the Frozen Faceoff. In 2018, the team won the NCHC regular-season title, the Penrose Cup, with a 16-4-4 record.

===Wrestling===

Huskies Wrestling won the NCAA Wrestling Championship in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2016 and 2015 and placed second in 2017, 2013, 2012, and 2011.

===Basketball===

From 1982–90, Women&#x27;s Huskies Basketball dominated the North Central Conference, compiling a 179-58 record in that timespan and advancing three times to the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division II Basketball Tournament quarterfinals. SCSU won the NSIC Championship in 2020, winning the title for the second time in program history and the first time since 2009.

Men&#x27;s Huskies basketball, created in 1901, made 10 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division II Basketball Tournament appearances. The Huskies advanced to a 2010 semifinal, losing 76–70 to Indiana University of Pennsylvania. They finished 29–6 that season.

Cunningham in discussing comet C/1951 C1 refers to her as &quot;Miss Pajdušáková (Mrs. Mrkos)&quot;, and there was an astronomy book published in 1956 by Ľudmila Mrkosová-Pajdušáková, as well as various scientific papers under this name from approximately 1952–1958. However, their respective biographies do not seem to mention any such marriage which, after all, ended in a divorce.

<text>Minnesota State University, Mankato (MNSU, MSU, or Minnesota State) is a public university in Mankato, Minnesota, United States. It is Minnesota&#x27;s second-largest university and has over 145,000 living alumni worldwide. Founded in 1868, it is the second-oldest member of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system and is commonly referred to as the flagship institution. It was established as the &quot;Second State Normal School&quot; in 1858 and officially opened as &quot;Mankato Normal School&quot; a decade later.

Across seven colleges and schools, Minnesota State offers over 130 undergraduate programs of study, over 80 master&#x27;s programs, and 4 doctoral programs. MNSU has two satellite campuses: one in the Twin Cities suburb Edina and one in Owatonna. Through the College of Extended Learning, it provides bachelor&#x27;s degrees online and at the Normandale Partnership Center in Bloomington. In 2023, MNSU partnered with Saint Paul College to launch the Minnesota Polytechnic and Applied Learning Institute (MinnPoly), becoming Minnesota&#x27;s first polytechnic institute.

The Minnesota State Mavericks compete in 21 intercollegiate sports, most at the NCAA Division II level in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference. Its men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams compete at the Division I level, respectively in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA).

==History==

=== 1860–1921: Founding and early years ===

The state legislature recognized the need for an education center in southern Minnesota by 1858. In 1860, it chartered the development of state-run normal schools to serve areas outside of Winona. The largest and fastest-growing cities outside of Saint Paul, Saint Cloud and Mankato were selected for the sites, dependent on local fundraising to establish the schools with seed money. Through the efforts of local attorney and state legislator Daniel Buck, the newly formed City of Mankato donated $5,000 raised from the community and sold $5,000 in bonds to found the second state normal school, Mankato Normal School. It was chartered in state law in 1860 and held its first classes in 1868, with an enrollment of 27. The school&#x27;s original mission was to train and educate teachers for rural schools in southern Minnesota. Early coursework included mathematics, science, civil engineering, agriculture, western classics, and basic pedagogy. The first Normal School-owned building&#x27;s cornerstone was laid on June 22, 1869. George M. Gage served as Mankato Normal School&#x27;s principal from 1868 to 1872.

During this period, Mankato Normal School provided educational certificates that allowed graduates to become schoolteachers, and most of the students were women. In relation to this focus on women&#x27;s education, Mankato Normal School is noted as the first public college in the U.S. to be headed by a woman, suffragette Julia Sears, in 1872. In 1873, the State Normal Board demoted Sears to assistant principal, replacing her as principal with David C. John. Sears&#x27;s salary as assistant principal was reduced from $1,500 to $1,200 and resulted in a letter to Gage that it was doubtful that she would see him again in Minnesota. In response, the assistant principal position was offered to Cornelius Hyde. Both Sears and Hyde arrived for work on September 1, 1873.

After it was determined that Hyde would receive the position, 41 students refused to attend classes and 32 were expelled for failing to return after three days. 60 residents signed a petition requesting that Hyde return to his position as instructor and that Sears be reinstated as assistant principal. This became known as the &quot;Sears Rebellion&quot;, which lasted until Sears left the school for a professorship at Peabody Normal School. These events were commemorated when a new residence hall was dedicated in honor of Sears in 2008 and a commission on the status of women was founded to support the advancement of women&#x27;s education at the institution in the 1990s.

=== 1921–1957: Teaching college, post-WWII expansion ===

By 1921, the school had grown to the point that it began to offer four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees. As a result, it was renamed &quot;Mankato State Teachers College&quot;. The original Old Main building was destroyed in a fire in 1922 and a new building was completed on April 4, 1924. Enrollment dipped during World War II and the college refocused its extension programs on providing education to members of the Works Progress Administration and Naval Corps.

Clarence L. Crawford became college president in 1946. He held the position for 20 years, overseeing and promoting tremendous growth of the college from approximately 400 students at the time of his arrival to about 14,000 when he retired in 1966. During the postwar period, student enrollment expanded greatly. The original university buildings were then in what was known as the Valley Campus, down the hill in lower Mankato. The Valley Campus&#x27;s size and footprint lacked the space needed to handle the growing student body. The Mankato Teachers College received 12 former Army barracks as a short-term solution. By the late 1950s work began on an entirely new, modern campus atop the river valley bluff. This became the Highland Campus. An experimental school, the Wilson School, was built on the Highland Campus to research and apply new teaching methods for students in grades K–12. The intention was to provide student teachers the opportunity to learn and experiment with new methods in a university environment.

=== 1957–1995: Transition to comprehensive university ===

By 1957, the institution&#x27;s mission had broadened to comprehensive four-year college education, and the legislature changed the school&#x27;s name to Mankato State College. By the 1960s the institution had grown so rapidly that a bill was proposed in the state legislature to elevate it to university status. Originally, Mankato State was to have been renamed the University of Southern Minnesota; a later amendment would have renamed it Minnesota State University. (These were proposed long before the television show &quot;Coach&quot; aired.) It was to be a second and independent state university equal in stature to the University of Minnesota at a time when there was only one research institution. There was significant opposition from the University of Minnesota and from Governor Karl Rolvaag at the time.
In 1975 the college successfully made the case for university status and was renamed &quot;Mankato State University&quot;. This change reflected a further 40% growth in the student body to 12,000 students by 1972. Following this, the number of programs increased, to include science, technology, engineering, health sciences, and others. While the transition to &quot;state university&quot; was being considered, the administration also explored the prospect of combining the Valley Campus buildings with the Highland Campus on the recommendation of a consultant hired by the Higher Education Coordinating Commission. Despite some faculty opposition to the merger, Mankato State University received permission to consolidate in May 1977 and completed the consolidation under President Margaret Preska on May 5, 1980. The Valley Campus was eventually sold to a private developer and the Highland Campus grew.

=== 1995–present: Minnesota State system, doctoral offerings ===
In 1995, the seven state universities were transferred to the newly created Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system by a mandate from the state legislature. The university was renamed Minnesota State University, Mankato in 1998 in recognition of its significant contribution to the state&#x27;s higher education system. This name change was also intended to broaden recognition of the university in the Midwest. Richard Rush, then the president of the university, said of the name change, &quot;Our goal is to make this university the other great public university in Minnesota.&quot; This marked a significant change in direction in the institution&#x27;s history, one that would later be realized as it fought to be authorized to award doctoral degrees. It was during this time that the institution began to call itself Minnesota State.

In 2007, in another major milestone, the university was authorized to begin offering applied doctoral degrees.

==Academics==
MNSU offers over 130 undergraduate programs of study, 13 pre-professional programs, and over 85 graduate programs. It provides a comprehensive education: each undergraduate program of study includes general requirements in mathematics, writing, cultural diversity, speech, information technology, and the environment. Minnesota State is among the nation&#x27;s top-producing master&#x27;s institutions of Fulbright recipients, producing 11 student grant awards and 41 Fulbright Scholars.

Each year, over 3,000 students graduate from MNSU. The Office of the Registrar confers around 3,000 bachelor&#x27;s, 600 master&#x27;s, 50 specialist, and 10 doctoral degrees. MNSU&#x27;s Career Development Center reports that 85% of graduates find employment in an area related to their field, and 90% were employed or continuing their education within 12 months of graduation.

=== Organization and administration ===
The university is organized into seven discipline-specific colleges. Academic programs, schools, and extended learning are divided among them:

=== Institutes and centers ===
Fourteen university-wide interdisciplinary centers and institutes work across collegiate lines:

=== Notable programs ===
MNSU has a history of creating new programs to meet the demand of new and developing fields. It was the nation&#x27;s first institution to offer a Master of Fine Arts degree in forensics. It also offered one of the first interdisciplinary programs in urban studies and local government management.

Notable programs include:

*The Aviation and Airport Management program is Minnesota&#x27;s only accredited aviation program. Graduates are often hired to work in nearby states as the program also serves regional needs. The university has developed national partnerships with Delta Air Lines and Sun Country Airlines that provide on-the-job training and direct hire before graduation.

=== Undergraduate student profile ===
Minnesota State&#x27;s undergraduate student body includes a large proportion of residential full-time students. It attracts the second-largest number of incoming Minnesota freshmen each year. For 2013–2016, the institution had rolling admissions with an acceptance rate of 65.5%, and the average accepted student ACT score ranged from 20 to 25.

Since the fall of 2012, the university has been the largest university in the Minnesota State system according to the total number of full-year equivalent students (14,443). St. Cloud State (13,938) has a significantly larger percentage of PSEO and part-time students that makes its headcount higher.

==Campus==

Originally called the &quot;Alternative Lifestyles Office&quot;, the center was founded by Minnesota State alumnus James Chalgren in 1977. Located in the Centennial Student Union, it is an independent office within the university&#x27;s division of Student Affairs. According to &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Minnesota State was voted one of the nation&#x27;s top 100 campuses for LGBT students.

==Athletics==
The Minnesota State Mavericks consists of eight men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s varsity teams. More than 650 students participate in athletics each year for the university. It offers teams in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey and basketball, football, baseball, golf, women&#x27;s swimming, track, cross country, women&#x27;s tennis, wrestling, soccer, golf, volleyball, and softball. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey teams both compete in NCAA Division I—the men in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA) and the women in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA). The men&#x27;s team had competed in the WCHA through the 2020–21 season, but was one of the seven men&#x27;s WCHA members that left after that season to reestablish the CCHA, leading to the WCHA disbanding its men&#x27;s division. Other university athletic teams began competing in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference of NCAA Division II in 2008–09 following the disbandment of the North Central Conference.

The school mascot is Stomper the Maverick, a caricature of a wild steer. The school colors are purple and gold.

Minnesota State athletics teams have placed favorably in national competitions in NCAA Division II athletics in several sports including hockey, football, baseball, women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s track &amp; field, wrestling, women&#x27;s soccer and softball. Since 1993, the Mavericks have captured the most individual national championships out of all sixteen colleges and universities in the Northern Sun Conference. The 2015 season marked the 14th straight year that the Mavericks finished in the top 25 in the country in the national standings, and the seventh time Minnesota State had posted a top-five placing for the Learfield Sports Directors&#x27; Cup. It has also won the NSIC US Bank All-Sports Award four times and placed second twice during the last six-year period of the 2008–2015 competition seasons. In 2024, the Mavericks won the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Division II basketball tournaments, making them the first school in four decades to win both in the same year.

The Minnesota State fight song is &quot;The Minnesota State Rouser&quot;, also known as the &quot;Maverick Rouser&quot;. It is played at all the athletics events as well as other events, along with the school song, &quot;The Minnesota State Hymn&quot;. The Minnesota State University Marching Band is called the &quot;Maverick Machine&quot;, and drives enthusiasm and school spirit at athletics events.

Minnesota State hosted the Minnesota Vikings summer training camp from 1966 to 2017. Each year over 60,000 fans traveled to Blakeslee Stadium to watch the team practice, attend signing events and meet and greets, followed by a fireworks show. In 2017, the Vikings ownership announced they would move the annual tradition to Eagan, Minnesota, following the construction of a new facility. The Vikings have since established a scholarship for Minnesota State students.

===Facility renovations and upgrades===
The Taylor Center opened in 2000, and was made possible by the donations of alumnus Glen Taylor. The 4,800-seat facility houses Maverick basketball, volleyball and wrestling teams. The MNSU Admissions office is also there, and the 5,000 square-foot Hall of Champions showcases the university&#x27;s history. In addition to Minnesota State Mavericks events, the Taylor Center hosts commencement ceremonies, concerts and lectures.

<text>Minnesota State University Moorhead (MSUM) is a public university in Moorhead, Minnesota, across the Red River of the North from Fargo, North Dakota. The school has an enrollment of 7,534 students in 2019 and 266 full-time faculty members. MSUM is a part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system.

==History==
The plans for what would become MSUM were laid down in 1885, when the Minnesota State Legislature passed a bill declaring the need for a new state normal school in the Red River Valley, with an eye on Moorhead. The State Senator who proposed the bill, State Senator Solomon Comstock, donated and appropriated the funds that would go to form &quot;Moorhead Normal School&quot;, which opened in 1888. In 1921, the State authorized the school to offer the four-year Bachelor of Science degree in Education in order to satisfy the need for high school teachers in northwest Minnesota, and the school became &quot;Moorhead State Teachers College&quot;.
With the entrance of World War II, the college entered into a contract with the Army Air Corps to train aviation students. After World War II, enrollment swelled to more than 700 students and the school diversified and broadened into both a liberal arts and professional curriculum. The school began offering a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1946 and graduate programs by 1953. As a result of the broadened offerings, by 1957 the name was changed to &quot;Moorhead State College&quot;. In 1969, the school joined a cooperative cross-registration exchange with neighboring Concordia College and North Dakota State University, creating the Tri-College University. The school continued to increase its number of programs and by 1975, the State Legislature that year granted the school university status under the name &quot;Moorhead State University&quot;. In 1995, Moorhead State became part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. On July 1, 2000, the school was renamed Minnesota State University Moorhead via a request sent to the board of trustees of the system.

Minnesota State University Moorhead was rated the 18th top liberal arts college in the midwest by &quot;TIME&quot; magazine in 2008.
The school has gone through many names changes with Moorhead Normal School (1887), Moorhead State Teachers College (1921), Moorhead State College (1957), Moorhead State University (1975) and finally Minnesota State University Moorhead (2000).

MSUM operates the New Rivers Press, a nonprofit literary press founded in 1968.

The campus newspaper is &quot;The Advocate&quot;, formerly&quot;The MiSTiC.&quot; &quot;The MiSTiC&quot; was closed by university administration in 1970.

The school also publishes a literary magazine, &quot;Red Weather,&quot; with the support of the English Department. The yearly publication is a journal of prose, poetry, interviews, photography and art by current undergraduates and graduate students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Students produce a weekly open-submission literary journal entitled &quot;The Yellow Bicycle,&quot; a collection of poetry, prose, essays, and reviews.

==Dragon Radio==
The school&#x27;s college radio station is KMSC, an unlicensed station which airs on AM 1500. KMSC is a student organization that has been set up to run as a Non-profit Educational radio station and serves as an in-house learning facility.

==Notable events==
MSUM sponsors a Student Academic Conference annually. The Student Academic Conference provides student researchers from each of its colleges with the opportunity to present their work to faculty, administration, peers, and the general public in a formal academic setting. The conference was first offered in 1998.

The conference provides a formal setting for upper class students to present their research from classes required under their major. There is a possibility of the student&#x27;s research being published or presented at a state, regional, or national conference. The Student Academic Conference is a great opportunity for students and MSUM to gain recognition on a larger scale. Any major or discipline can present at the conference as long as it abides by conference rules based on which forum the student chooses to present the research. There is an option to orally present using visual aids, Powerpoint, etc..., or the student can construct a poster board displaying key points and results to be presented in a more informal manner taking questions and inquiries from onlookers. The conference is kicked off by a luncheon for all the participants. For some majors, presenting at the conference is mandatory in which the student presents their discipline&#x27;s research from their senior seminar or thesis class.

<text>Southwest Minnesota State University (SMSU) is a public university in Marshall, Minnesota, United States. It is part of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system. The university has an enrollment of approximately 8,700 students and employs 148 faculty members. It is divided into two major colleges, the College of Arts, Letters, and Sciences and the College of Business, Education, and Professional Studies.

== History ==
The university was founded in 1964 as &quot;Southwest Minnesota State College&quot; (&#x27;SMSC&#x27;). It admitted its first class of students on September 19, 1967. The college became &quot;Southwest State University&quot; (&#x27;SSU&#x27;) on August 1, 1975, and kept that name for nearly 30 years until adopting the name Southwest Minnesota State University (SMSU) on July 1, 2003.

The student newspaper, originally called &quot;The Impact,&quot; was first published May 10, 1968. The name was changed to &quot;The Reader&quot; in 1974, and then back to &quot;The Impact&quot; in 1980. In 2003 the name was changed to &quot;The Spur&quot; to be more consistent with the Mustang theme and to spur students into action.

The R/A (Recreation/Athletic) Facility was built in 1996 and is a 4,000-seat multi-purpose venue.

On January 2, 2002, a fire destroyed the Student Center. The dome&#x27;s concrete framework was incorporated into the new student and conference center and is still visible in the food court area. The new center was completed in 2005. It features a replica of the original dome with the words &quot;Student Center Dome: 1972–2002&quot; written on it at the Alumni Heritage Center, near the Mustang Zone in the upper level.

In 2005 SMSU developed the first bachelor&#x27;s degree culinology program in the nation to be approved by the Research Chefs Association.

On September 6, 2008, the new Regional Event Center officially opened on the western edge of campus. The athletic field was named Mattke Field after the old field, and in honor of past athletic director Glenn Mattke. The center is used by the Mustang football and soccer teams, as well as teams from Marshall High School, and for other regional activities, such as concerts. It took two years and $16 million to complete.

== Academics ==

Southwest Minnesota State University provides undergraduate education in the liberal arts and professional studies. The most popular undergraduate majors are business administration and education. It also has specialized graduate programs in education, special education, and business administration. The MBA program has degree options in marketing, leadership, and the general MBA. Students can take classes both onsite and online. The graduate school does not have a student senate, but there is an MBA student organization. A critical element of the undergraduate and graduate business programs&#x27; success is the Southwest Marketing Advisory Center, where students can do research on actual businesses.

In addition to being regionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, SMSU&#x27;s programs are also accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, the Minnesota Board of Teaching, the American Chemical Society and the Council on Social Work Education.

== Campus ==

Most of the SMSU campus was constructed between 1965 and 1973 according to a unified plan. The brick and concrete buildings are interconnected via tunnels and enclosed walkways, providing a continuous and controlled environment during both summer and winter. The residence halls are not connected. There are many courtyards with gardens between the buildings. The campus is virtually barrier-free, allowing easy access to students in wheelchairs.

The university&#x27;s residence halls were named by the students during the late 1960s and reflect various themes and values of the times, e.g. Aquarius, Casa Futura, Methedras and Kama Sutra. Armstrong Hall was named after astronaut Neil Armstrong in honor of his trip to the moon in 1969. Manchester Hall was named for pop singer Melissa Manchester after a concert she gave on campus.

In 2009 the university opened a new dorm named Sweetland Hall in honor of a late president, Douglas Sweetland.

Residence halls:
* Traditional Halls – Six complexes of four connected halls that were built in the 1960s and feature a common bathroom for the whole floor.
* Sweetland Hall – A new complex with around 250 beds with a bathroom shared by suit-mates (two to four people).
* Foundation Apartments – Apartment style residence hall with laundry and kitchen appliances in each apartment.

There are no fraternities or sororities on campus.

=== Organizations ===
The Southwest Marketing Advisory Center (SMAC) is located on the second floor of the Science and Technology building, Room 203. SMAC is a self-funded entity within the academic marketing program at Southwest State. Its mission is to serve the marketing and research needs of southwestern Minnesota while giving real-world experience to junior, senior and graduate-level student employees.

Each student attending Southwest Minnesota State University pays a 43-cent per credit fee to fund the Minnesota State University Student Association, a student-led nonprofit organization that advocates on behalf of all students.

== Athletics ==

The school athletic teams are the Mustangs. Their colors are the prairie colors of brown and gold.

The Mustangs compete in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC), which is a part of NCAA Division II. Programs for men include basketball, wheelchair basketball, baseball, cross country, track, football, and wrestling. The programs for women are basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball and swimming.

<doc id="624204" wikidata="Q578219" url="?curid=624204" title="Kenny Wheeler">
<text>Kenneth Vincent John Wheeler, OC (14 January 1930 – 18 September 2014) was a Canadian composer and trumpet and flugelhorn player, based in the U.K. from the 1950s onwards.

Most of his performances were rooted in jazz, but he was also active in free improvisation and occasionally contributed to rock music recordings. Wheeler wrote over one hundred compositions and was a skilled arranger for small groups and large ensembles.

Wheeler was the patron of the Royal Academy Junior Jazz course.

==Early life==
Wheeler was born in Toronto, Ontario, on 14 January 1930. Growing up in Toronto, he began playing the cornet at age 12 and became interested in jazz in his mid-teens. Wheeler spent a year studying composition at The Royal Conservatory of Music in 1950. In 1952 he moved to Britain. He found his way into the London jazz scene of the time, playing in groups led by Tommy Whittle, Tubby Hayes, and Ronnie Scott.

==Career==
In the late 1950s, he was a member of Buddy Featherstonhaugh&#x27;s quintet together with Bobby Wellins. From 1959 until 1965 he was a member of John Dankworth&#x27;s orchestra, during which time he also studied composition with Richard Rodney Bennett (1962-3) and Bill Russo (1963-4). He also with (Eric Burdon and) the Animals&#x27; Big Band that made its only public appearance at the 5th Annual British Jazz &amp; Blues Festival in Richmond (1965) with tenors Stan Robinson, Dick Morrissey and Al Gay, baritone sax Paul Carroll, and fellow trumpets Ian Carr and Greg Brown. In 1968, Wheeler appeared on guitarist Terry Smith&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Fall Out&quot;.

Wheeler performed and recorded his own compositions with large jazz ensembles throughout his career, beginning with the first album under his own name, &quot;Windmill Tilter&quot; (1969), recorded with the John Dankworth band. BGO Records released a CD in September 2010. The big band album &quot;Song for Someone&quot; (1973) fused Wheeler&#x27;s characteristic orchestral writing with passages of free improvisation provided by musicians such as Evan Parker and Derek Bailey, and was also named Album of the Year by &quot;Melody Maker&quot; magazine in 1975. It has subsequently been reissued on CD by Parker&#x27;s Psi label.

In the mid-1960s, Wheeler became a close participant in the nascent free improvisation movement in London, playing with Parker, John Stevens, the Spontaneous Music Ensemble and the Globe Unity Orchestra. Despite the above-noted accomplishments, much of his reputation rests on his work with smaller jazz groups. Wheeler&#x27;s first small group recordings to gain significant critical attention were &quot;Gnu High&quot; (1975) and &quot;Deer Wan&quot; (1977), both for the ECM label (&quot;Gnu High&quot; is one of the few albums to feature Keith Jarrett as a sideman since his tenure with Charles Lloyd). One exception from the ongoing collaboration with ECM was his rare album on CBC called &quot;Ensemble Fusionaire&quot; in 1976. This had three other Canadian musicians and was recorded in St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Toronto for a different character to the sound than on the ECM recordings.

Wheeler was the trumpeter in the Anthony Braxton Quartet from 1971 to 1976. He was also a member of the chamber jazz trio Azimuth with John Taylor and Norma Winstone from 1977 to 2000. Their first release under this name was a 1977 album issued by ECM; two albums followed, with later albums coming in 1985 and 1995. He was featured in a profile on composer Graham Collier in the 1985 Channel 4 documentary &quot;Hoarded Dreams&quot;.

==Later life==
&quot;Music for Large &amp; Small Ensembles&quot; (1990) included the Wheeler compositions &quot;Sea Lady&quot; and &quot;The Sweet Time Suite&quot;, the latter his most ambitious extended work for big band since &quot;Windmill Tilter&quot;. In 1997 Wheeler received widespread critical praise for his album &quot;Angel Song&quot;, which featured an unusual drummer-less quartet of Bill Frisell (guitar), Dave Holland (bass) and Lee Konitz (alto sax). Wheeler recorded seven albums with CAM Jazz from 2005 to 2008 but returned to ECM to record his final album, &quot;Songs for Quintet&quot;, in 2013.

Wheeler died after a short period of frail health at a nursing home in London on 18 September 2014. He was 84 years old. He was survived by his wife, Doreen, and his children, Mark and Louanne.

<text>2MBS Fine Music Sydney (ACMA callsign: 2MBS) is a Sydney music radio station operated by the Music Broadcasting Society of New South Wales Co-Operative Limited. Launched on 15 December 1974, it is Australia&#x27;s first fully licensed FM radio station and it has since reached over 630,000 listeners.

==Format==
Approximately 50 percent of 2MBS Fine Music Sydney&#x27;s on-air music content is from the western classical and related traditions which include baroque music, opera, contemporary classical music and chamber music. The remainder is made up of jazz, blues, operetta, world music, folk music, piano music, film soundtracks, documentary music, stage shows, oldies, sacred music, ethnic music, ambient music, and non-mainstream and experimental contemporary music.

==Background==
The station broadcasts from studios located at Chandos Street, St Leonards, to the greater Sydney region at a frequency of 102.5 MHz from a 50 kilowatt (ERP) transmitter located in the northern suburb of Artarmon. Its operations are conducted by volunteers and a small number of paid staff. Operational funding is principally derived from corporate sponsorship, arts partnerships, philanthropic donations, listener subscriptions, and the secondhand Book and CD Fairs held around the Sydney area.

In February 2020, the station rebranded from Fine Music 102.5 to Fine Music Sydney. and in 2022 added the prefix 2MBS to its name again to become 2MBS Fine Music Sydney.

==Programming==
One of the station&#x27;s most popular programmes for several decades was &quot;Evensong&quot;, a weekly programme of English sacred music in the Anglican tradition. Its regular presenter Mrs. Ann Ramsay died at the age of 91 on 1 April 2006. &quot;Evensong&quot; has been replaced by another popular Sunday program, &quot;Hosanna&quot;.

Popular non-classical programmes broadcast by the station include the blues show &quot;Stormy Monday&quot;, which has aired on Monday evenings for three decades, and for many years was rebroadcast nationally by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA) satellite service. &quot;Ultima Thule&quot;, the station&#x27;s Sunday evening ambient music programme has been on air for nearly twenty years, and in 2005 became the first programme to be podcast on Australian community radio.

Fine Music Sydney is a member of the Australian Fine Music network which is a loose affiliation with a number of similar independently owned and operated stations in other parts of Australia, including 3MBS FM Melbourne, 4MBS FM Brisbane, 5MBS FM Adelaide, and ArtSound FM Canberra.

<text>Winona State University (WSU) is a public university in Winona, Minnesota, United States. It was founded as First State Normal School of Minnesota in 1858 and is the oldest member of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System. It was the first normal school west of the Mississippi River.

WSU offers more than 80 programs on its main campus as well as collegiate programs on satellite campuses at Winona State University-Rochester. Its average annual enrollment is approximately 9,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Its sports teams compete as the Winona State Warriors in the NCAA Division II athletics in 14 sports, primarily in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference.

==History==

Winona State University was founded as the First State Normal School, an institution specifically for educating and producing new elementary school teachers. In the 1850s, Minnesota was on the American frontier and lacked trained teachers. Winona settler John Ford lobbied the Minnesota Legislature to establish normal schools and rallied more than $5,000 in local donations to establish the state&#x27;s first such institution. It was also the first tax-funded school west of the Mississippi River.

Classes at Winona Normal School began in September 1860, but the next year most of the male students as well as the principal and other staff left to serve in the American Civil War. The school closed in March 1862 due to the war, then for another two years due to the Sioux War of 1862. Its first class graduated in 1866. The program soon added a laboratory school in which local children received education from faculty while students observed or, occasionally, led lessons themselves. The normal school quickly outgrew its original four-room building, but state funding and local donations of money and land led to the construction of a proper facility in 1869.

The campus expanded with two new wings on &quot;Old Main&quot; in 1894, a library/gymnasium/kindergarten building—Ogden Hall—in 1909, and a women&#x27;s dormitory—Morey Hall—in 1910. In 1915 a new building was constructed to house the laboratory school, and a second women&#x27;s dormitory—Shepard Hall—appeared in 1920.

Winona State Normal School became Winona Teachers College in 1921 and was authorized to grant a four-year Bachelor of Education degree. In December 1922 a fire broke out in Old Main and completely destroyed it. No one was harmed, as it was during a term break. Local public buildings and churches offered space for classes and administrative business until a new main building, College Hall, was constructed in 1924.

The 1915 Model School Building, now Phelps Hall, and the 1924 College Hall, now Somsen Hall, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013 for having local significance in education. They were nominated as examples of the normal school movement, which helped shape public education in Minnesota. Winona Normal School was Minnesota&#x27;s first teacher training school and first laboratory school, and operated from 1860 to 1971.

==Academics==

Winona State University offers 65 undergraduate programs and 12 graduate programs. It was one of the earliest universities in the country to offer a &quot;Laptop University&quot; program, now known as the e-Warrior Digital Life and Learning Program. In this program, each student, upon acceptance, is required to lease their choice of either an Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows-based laptop from the university. In 2013 WSU became the first public university in the Midwest to offer a tablet and a laptop to all students. The program&#x27;s purpose is to increase the bond between education and technology.

Each Winona State University student pays 43 cents per credit to fund the Minnesota State University Student Association, a student-led nonprofit that advocates on behalf of all Minnesota state university students.

===International education===

The International Services Office is the initial contact for all international students. Winona State University provides scholarship opportunities for International Students.

Winona State University has established many sister school relations with colleges and universities around the world, including Tamkang University in Taiwan, Hebei University of Technology in Mainland China, Akita University, Tokyo International University, Toyo University in Japan, Soonchunhyang University, Chung-Ang University in South Korea, and universities in Malaysia, Mexico, Spain, Egypt, Hong Kong, Australia, etc.

==Winona State facilities==

===Housing===
Winona State University uses 16 buildings as on-campus living communities. Nine are on the main campus, and four are east of campus. Three buildings (Lourdes Hall, Tau Center, and Maria Hall) previously formed a West Campus, which was used for on-campus living until 2021.

====Kirkland Hall and Haake Hall====
Originally named New Hall East and New Center West, Kirkland Hall/Haake Hall opened in 2010 and consists of two adjacent buildings that are mirror images of each other. The coed complex has 106 units, each single-gendered.

====Prentiss-Lucas Hall====
Prentiss-Lucas Hall (commonly called P-L) is one of the six freshmen residence halls. Its two sides are mirror-image duplicates of each other (Prentiss is the men&#x27;s residence side and Lucas the women&#x27;s), linked by a common lobby and lower level. This hall closed down after the spring semester of 2019, but reopened in fall 2020 to accommodate single-occupancy room housing in response to COVID-19.

====The Quad====
The Quad has four residence halls that form a square: Conway Hall, Richards Hall, Morey and Shepard Halls. The Quad contains multiple lounges, typically where the four residence halls intersect each other. It houses over 500 students, mostly freshmen. Conway Hall is a four-story building that has one female floor, one male floor, and two gender-inclusive floors. Morey and Shepard Halls are connected in an &quot;L&quot; shape. Morey-Shepard consists of men and women divided by floor. Richards Hall is a four-story residence hall. Richards is also co-ed; the first and third floor, excluding the Richards Annex, house men and the second and fourth women. Morey Hall is the oldest on campus, completed in 1911.

====Sheehan Hall====
Sheehan Hall was completed for Winona State College as a 14-story women-only hall in 1969. It is now co-ed, and houses most freshmen. The second through 13th floors are residential and the first is a lobby and social area with a full kitchen.

====Sustainability House====
The Sustainability House was renovated in 2011–2012. The house is used for a cohort of U.S. military veterans and additional students as necessary.

====East Lake Apartments====
East Lake was built in 2002-03 and opened in 2004, and serves as an apartment complex for both men and women. East Lake typically houses upperclassmen. Students living in East Lake need not purchase a meal plan, but can instead get a &quot;block meal&quot; plan.

====Discontinued housing====

The following buildings were known as West Campus (Residential College). They were also previously owned and operated by the College of Saint Teresa, a defunct Roman Catholic women&#x27;s college. West Campus was closed for residential purposes in 2021 and put up for sale in 2022.

Winona State acquired Lourdes Hall in the early 1990s. It was completed in 1928 for the College of St. Teresa. Lourdes Hall was put up for sale with Tau Center and Maria Hall in 2022. 

Tau Center was acquired in 2003 and serves as a coeducational residence hall/conference center. It is on Winona State&#x27;s West Campus, behind Lourdes, and is governed in conjunction with Maria Hall. Tau was previously operated by the Diocese of Winona. It was sold to Cotter Schools in the spring of 2022.

Maria Hall was acquired in 2000 and serves as a coeducational, and typically freshman, residence hall, with the first and third floor as female floors and second and fourth as male floors. Each floor has a full lounge and kitchen, complete with television, furniture, stove, refrigerator, microwave, and toaster. The basement has two large lounges, a kitchen, and a laundry room. Maria Hall houses just over 200 students. A tunnel connects Maria to Lourdes Hall. It was sold to Cotter Schools in the spring of 2022.

==Athletics==

Winona State University competes in Division II NCAA athletics and its teams are called the Warriors. It is a member of the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference for most sports, except women&#x27;s gymnastics (Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference).

The school&#x27;s first national championship came in 1985 when the gymnastics team took the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) title, claiming four individual champions and 11 All-American honors, along with National Coach and Gymnast of the Year. The same year, the Warrior gymnastics team competed in the NCAA Division II nationals in Springfield, Massachusetts, taking home the third-place trophy, the first Winona State team to compete in both affiliations at the national level. The Warriors claimed the NAIA national title again in 1987, this time paced by one individual champion and seven All-American honors. Two gymnasts were named Academic All-Americans for their outstanding academic achievements, and the National Coach of the Year award went to WSU&#x27;s head coach.

In the three following years, the gymnasts finished strong in the NCAA II regional competitions and sent individuals to the Division II nationals in 1986 (2) and 1987 (1). In 1989, the team represented the school at the Division II nationals in California after a record-breaking season.

The WSU football team won the NSIC conference championship ten times in 15 years (1993–2007). The Warriors have also appeared in postseason playoffs five times. During the 1993 season they appeared in the NAIA I playoffs and they appeared in the NCAA II playoffs in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2017. They also participated in the Mineral Water Bowl in 2000, 2002, and 2012.

The men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2006 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division II Basketball Championship, the university&#x27;s first NCAA title. On March 7, 2007, the men&#x27;s basketball team won its 53rd consecutive regular or postseason victory, beating the Division II mark set by Langston University. The streak ended at 57 on March 24, 2007, with a 77-75 loss at the Division II Championship game to the Barton College Bulldogs on a last-second shot. On March 29, 2008, the men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Augusta State University 87-76 to win its second NCAA Division II National Championship in three years.

Winona State&#x27;s softball team appeared in one Women&#x27;s College World Series in 1974.

Winona State&#x27;s baseball team played for a national championship on June 4, 2011, facing West Florida in Cary, North Carolina, in the final of the NCAA Division II World Series, and finishing second.

The women&#x27;s 2012 cross-country team qualified for the NCAA DII National Cross-Country Championship, placing 9th overall. Two runners earned All-American status and set the new school record with a time of 21:11 in the 6K race.

<doc id="624208" wikidata="Q591153" url="?curid=624208" title="Tony Oxley">
<text>Tony Oxley (15 June 1938 – 26 December 2023) was an English free improvising drummer and electronic musician.

Born in Sheffield, Oxley moved to London in 1966 and became house drummer at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club where he accompanied visiting musicians such as Joe Henderson, Lee Konitz, Charlie Mariano, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, and Bill Evans until the early 1970s. Each year between 1969 and 1972 he topped the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; annual jazz readers poll for drummers. In 1970 Oxley helped found Incus Records, with Derek Bailey and others; the label would go on to release more than 50 albums.

In 1993 he joined a quartet with Tomasz Stańko, Bobo Stenson and Anders Jormin, and regularly released albums under his own name throughout the 2000s. His last albums were &quot;Unreleased 1974–2016&quot; (2022) and &quot;The New World&quot; (2023), both released on the Discus label.

==Biography==
Tony Oxley was born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, on 15 June 1938. A self-taught pianist by the age of eight, he first began playing the drums at seventeen. In Sheffield he was taught by Haydon Cook. While playing evening gigs with local dance bands at night, he was sacked from his regular job, at a cutlery-making company, for falling asleep.

During his National Service, with the Black Watch military band, from 1957 to 1960, he studied music theory and improved his drumming technique. After leaving the army he became a member of a dance band playing for passengers on the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and made several trips to New York. When on shore leave he would visit clubs and hear some of the leading modern jazz figures such as Philly Joe Jones, Horace Silver, Art Blakey. From 1960 to 1964 he led a quartet which performed locally in England. Between transatlantic trips he played in a cabaret band in Chesterfield.

By 1963 Oxley was also playing Saturday afternoon gigs with other aspiring young jazz musicians at the Grapes pub in Sheffield. In 1963 he began working with Gavin Bryars and guitarist Derek Bailey, in a trio known as Joseph Holbrooke. Oxley moved to London in 1966 and became house drummer at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s, where he accompanied visiting musicians such as Joe Henderson, Lee Konitz, Charlie Mariano, Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, and Bill Evans until the early 1970s. He was a member of bands led by Gordon Beck and Mike Pyne.

In 1969 Oxley appeared on the John McLaughlin album &quot;Extrapolation&quot; and formed a quintet with Bailey, Jeff Clyne, Evan Parker, and Kenny Wheeler, releasing the album &quot;The Baptised Traveller&quot;. Following this album the group was joined by Paul Rutherford on trombone and became a sextet, releasing the 1970 album &quot;4 Compositions for Sextet&quot;. That same year Oxley helped found Incus Records with Bailey and others and Musicians Cooperative. The label would go on to release more than 50 albums, continuing even after disagreements caused first Oxley and then Parker to leave. He received a three-month artist-in-residence job at the Sydney Conservatorium in Australia in 1970. Around this time he joined the London Jazz Composers Orchestra and collaborated with Howard Riley. 

Oxley was also a member of the saxophonist Alan Skidmore&#x27;s quintet, which in 1969 won awards at the Montreux Jazz Festival for best group, best soloist and best drummer. With the trio of the pianist Howard Riley, he began using amplification on his expanding drum kit. Each year between 1969 and 1972 he topped the &quot;Melody Maker&quot; annual jazz readers poll for drummers. In 1973 he became a tutor at the Jazz Summer School in Barry, South Wales, and in 1974 he formed the band Angular Apron. Through the 1980s he worked with Tony Coe and Didier Levallet and started the Celebration Orchestra during the latter half of the decade. In the late 1980s, Oxley toured and recorded with Anthony Braxton, and also began a working relationship with Cecil Taylor.

In 1993 he joined a quartet with Tomasz Stańko, Bobo Stenson and Anders Jormin. In 2000 he released the album &quot;Triangular Screen&quot; with the Tony Oxley Project 1, a trio with Ivar Grydeland and Tonny Kluften.

Oxley&#x27;s own abstract paintings appeared on the covers of some of his later albums, including his last, &quot;The New World&quot;, a recording of electronic and acoustic percussion music, released on the Discus label in 2023.

== Personal life and death ==
Oxley married Tutta (nee Rütten) in 2000.

He died on 26 December 2023, at the age of 85.

<doc id="624209" wikidata="Q1155653" url="?curid=624209" title="Induction heating">
<text>Induction heating is the process of heating electrically conductive materials, namely metals or semi-conductors, by electromagnetic induction, through heat transfer passing through an inductor that creates an electromagnetic field within the coil to heat up and possibly melt steel, copper, brass, graphite, gold, silver, aluminum, or carbide.

An important feature of the induction heating process is that the heat is generated inside the object itself, instead of by an external heat source via heat conduction. Thus objects can be heated very rapidly. In addition, there need not be any external contact, which can be important where contamination is an issue. Induction heating is used in many industrial processes, such as heat treatment in metallurgy, Czochralski crystal growth and zone refining used in the semiconductor industry, and to melt refractory metals that require very high temperatures. It is also used in induction cooktops.

An induction heater consists of an electromagnet and an electronic oscillator that passes a high-frequency alternating current (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating magnetic field penetrates the object, generating electric currents inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flow through the resistance of the material, and heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials, such as iron, heat also is generated by magnetic hysteresis losses. The frequency of the electric current used for induction heating depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated), and the penetration depth.

==Applications==

Induction heating allows the targeted heating of an applicable item for applications including surface hardening, melting, brazing and soldering, and heating to fit. Due to their ferromagnetic nature, iron and its alloys respond best to induction heating. Eddy currents can, however, be generated in any conductor, and magnetic hysteresis can occur in any magnetic material. Induction heating has been used to heat liquid conductors (such as molten metals) and also gaseous conductors (such as a gas plasma—see Induction plasma technology). Induction heating is often used to heat graphite crucibles (containing other materials) and is used extensively in the semiconductor industry for the heating of silicon and other semiconductors. Utility frequency (50/60 Hz) induction heating is used for many lower-cost industrial applications as inverters are not required.

===Furnace===
An induction furnace uses induction to heat metal to its melting point. Once molten, the high-frequency magnetic field can also be used to stir the hot metal, which is useful in ensuring that alloying additions are fully mixed into the melt. Most induction furnaces consist of a tube of water-cooled copper rings surrounding a container of refractory material. Induction furnaces are used in most modern foundries as a cleaner method of melting metals than a reverberatory furnace or a cupola. Sizes range from a kilogram of capacity to a hundred tonnes. Induction furnaces often emit a high-pitched whine or hum when they are running, depending on their operating frequency. Metals melted include iron and steel, copper, aluminium, and precious metals. Because it is a clean and non-contact process, it can be used in a vacuum or inert atmosphere. Vacuum furnaces use induction heating to produce specialty steels and other alloys that would oxidize if heated in the presence of air.

===Welding===

A similar, smaller-scale process is used for induction welding. Plastics may also be welded by induction, if they are either doped with ferromagnetic ceramics (where magnetic hysteresis of the particles provides the heat required) or by metallic particles.

Seams of tubes can be welded this way. Currents induced in a tube run along the open seam and heat the edges resulting in a temperature high enough for welding. At this point, the seam edges are forced together and the seam is welded. The RF current can also be conveyed to the tube by brushes, but the result is still the same—the current flows along the open seam, heating it.

===Manufacturing===
In the Rapid Induction Printing metal additive printing process, a conductive wire feedstock and shielding gas is fed through a coiled nozzle, subjecting the feedstock to induction heating and ejection from the nozzle as a liquid, in order to refuse under shielding to form three-dimensional metal structures. The core benefit of the use of induction heating in this process is significantly greater energy and material efficiency as well as a higher degree of safety when compared with other additive manufacturing methods, such as selective laser sintering, which deliver heat to the material using a powerful laser or electron beam.

===Cooking===

In induction cooking, an induction coil inside the cooktop heats the iron base of cookware by magnetic induction. Using induction cookers produces safety, efficiency (the induction cooktop is not heated itself), and speed. Non-ferrous pans such as copper-bottomed pans and aluminium pans are generally unsuitable. By thermal conduction, the heat induced in the base is transferred to the food inside.

===Brazing===

Induction brazing is often used in higher production runs. It produces uniform results and is very repeatable. There are many types of industrial equipment where induction brazing is used. For instance, Induction is used for brazing carbide to a shaft.

===Sealing===

Induction heating is used in &quot;cap sealing&quot; of containers in the food and pharmaceutical industries. A layer of aluminum foil is placed over the bottle or jar opening and heated by induction to fuse it to the container. This provides a tamper-resistant seal since altering the contents requires breaking the foil.

===Heating to fit===

Induction heating is often used to heat an item causing it to expand before fitting or assembly. Bearings are routinely heated in this way using utility frequency (50/60 Hz) and a laminated steel transformer-type core passing through the centre of the bearing.

===Heat treatment===

Induction heating is often used in the heat treatment of metal items. The most common applications are induction hardening of steel parts, induction soldering/brazing as a means of joining metal components, and induction annealing to selectively soften an area of a steel part.

Induction heating can produce high-power densities which allow short interaction times to reach the required temperature. This gives tight control of the heating pattern with the pattern following the applied magnetic field quite closely and allows reduced thermal distortion and damage.

This ability can be used in hardening to produce parts with varying properties. The most common hardening process is to produce a localised surface hardening of an area that needs wear resistance while retaining the toughness of the original structure as needed elsewhere. The depth of induction hardened patterns can be controlled through the choice of induction frequency, power density, and interaction time.

Limits to the flexibility of the process arise from the need to produce dedicated inductors for many applications. This is quite expensive and requires the marshalling of high-current densities in small copper inductors, which can require specialized engineering and &quot;copper-fitting.&quot;

=== Plastic processing===

Induction heating is used in plastic injection molding machines. Induction heating improves energy efficiency for injection and extrusion processes. Heat is directly generated in the barrel of the machine, reducing warm-up time and energy consumption. The induction coil can be placed outside thermal insulation, so it operates at low temperatures and has a long life. The frequency used ranges from 30 kHz down to 5 kHz, decreasing for thicker barrels. The reduction in the cost of inverter equipment has made induction heating increasingly popular. Induction heating can also be applied to molds, offering more even mold temperature and improved product quality.

=== Pyrolysis ===

Induction heating is used to obtain biochar in the pyrolysis of biomass. Heat is directly generated into shaker reactor walls, enabling the pyrolysis of the biomass with good mixing and temperature control.
=== Bolt heating ===

Induction heating is used by mechanics to remove rusted bolts. The heat helps remove the rust induced tension between the threads. 

==Details==
The basic setup is an AC power supply that provides electricity with low voltage but very high current and high frequency. The workpiece to heat is placed inside an air coil driven by the power supply, usually in combination with a resonant tank capacitor to increase the reactive power. The alternating magnetic field induces eddy currents in the workpiece.

The frequency of the inductive current determines the depth that the induced eddy currents penetrate the workpiece. In the simplest case of a solid round bar, the induced current decreases exponentially from the surface. The penetration depth formula_1 in which 86% of power will be concentrated, can be derived as formula_2, where formula_1 is the depth in meters, formula_4 is the resistivity of the workpiece in ohm-meters, formula_5 is the dimensionless relative magnetic permeability of the workpiece, and formula_6 is the frequency of the AC field in Hz. The AC field can be calculated using the formula formula_7. The equivalent resistance of the workpiece and thus the efficiency is a function of the workpiece diameter formula_8 over the reference depth formula_9, increasing rapidly up to about formula_10. Since the workpiece diameter is fixed by the application, the value of formula_11 is determined by the reference depth. Decreasing the reference depth requires increasing the frequency. Since the cost of induction power supplies increases with frequency, supplies are often optimized to achieve a critical frequency at which formula_10. If operated below the critical frequency, heating efficiency is reduced because eddy currents from either side of the workpiece impinge upon one another and cancel out. Increasing the frequency beyond the critical frequency creates minimal further improvement in heating efficiency, although it is used in applications that seek to heat treat only the surface of the workpiece.

Relative depth varies with temperature because resistivities and permeability vary with temperature. For steel, the relative permeability drops to 1 above the Curie temperature. Thus the reference depth can vary with temperature by a factor of 2–3 for nonmagnetic conductors and by as much as 20 for magnetic steels.

Magnetic materials improve the induction heat process because of hysteresis. Materials with high permeability (100–500) are easier to heat with induction heating. Hysteresis heating occurs below the Curie temperature, where materials retain their magnetic properties. High permeability below the Curie temperature in the workpiece is useful. Temperature difference, mass, and specific heat influence the workpiece heating.

The energy transfer of induction heating is affected by the distance between the coil and the workpiece. Energy losses occur through heat conduction from workpiece to fixture, natural convection, and thermal radiation.

The induction coil is usually made of copper tubing and fluid coolant. Diameter, shape, and number of turns influence the efficiency and field pattern.

== Core type furnace ==
The furnace consists of a circular hearth that contains the charge to be melted in the form of a ring. The metal ring is large in diameter and is magnetically interlinked with an electrical winding energized by an AC source. It is essentially a transformer where the charge to be heated forms a single-turn short circuit secondary and is magnetically coupled to the primary by an iron core.

<doc id="624210" wikidata="Q1046396" url="?curid=624210" title="3728 IRAS">
<text>3728 IRAS, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the middle region of the asteroid belt, approximately 20 kilometers in diameter. On 23 August 1983, it was discovered by and later named after IRAS, a spaceborne all-sky infrared survey satellite.

== Classification and orbit ==

The S-type asteroid is also classified as a CX-type by Pan-STARRS″ large-scale survey. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.1–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,576 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.21 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. The first used precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in 1950, extending the asteroid&#x27;s observation arc by 33 years prior to its discovery.

== Rotation period ==

In August 2008, a photometric lightcurve analysis by U.S. astronomer Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory (), Colorado, gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.21 in magnitude ().

== Diameter estimates ==

According to 12 observations by the discovering Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the asteroid has an albedo of 0.12 and a diameter of 19.6 kilometers. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; derives similar figures, as do the space-based surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Two publications from the post-cryogenic NEOWISE mission find a larger diameter of 23.4 and 27.5 kilometers, respectively.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named for the discovering Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), a collaboration between the United States (NASA), the Netherlands (NIVR), and the United Kingdom (SERC), which observed more than 250,000 celestial bodies in the infrared at wavelengths between 12 and 100 μm during 10 months in 1983. IRAS has also discovered two other minor planets, the 11-kilometer sized main-belt asteroid and 3200 Phaethon, a near-Earth and potentially hazardous object, parent body of the Geminid meteor shower, as well as six comets, such as 126P/IRAS, a short-period Jupiter family comet, which was also named after the discovering space observatory. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 4 May 1999 ().

<text>Lamar University (Lamar or LU) is a public university in Beaumont, Texas, United States. Lamar has been a member of the Texas State University System since 1995. It was the flagship institution of the former Lamar University System. As of the fall of 2024, the university enrollment was 17,850 students. Lamar University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and named for Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas.

The university campus has an urban setting and the core campus of LU is 299-plus acres. LU is organized into five undergraduate colleges, one graduate college and an honors college.

==History==
Louis R. Pietzsch founded a public junior college in Beaumont&#x27;s South Park area at the direction of the South Park School District. Lamar University started on September 17, 1923 as South Park Junior College, operating on the unused third floor of the new South Park High School. Pietzsch acted as the first president of the college. South Park Junior College became the first college in Texas to receive Texas Department of Education approval during the first year of operation and became fully accredited in 1925.

In 1932, the college administration, recognizing that the junior college was serving the region rather than just the community, renamed it Lamar College. It was named for Mirabeau B. Lamar, the second president of the Republic of Texas, who arranged to set aside land in counties for public schools. A statue of him was installed in the quadrangle of the campus near the Setzer Student Center. In 1933, the college was moving toward independence from South Park High School when construction began on new facilities. By 1942, the college was completely independent of the South Park school district, and operations moved to the current campus.

With the end of World War II, an influx of veterans boosted enrollment. The Lamar Board of Trustees asked the Texas Legislature to promote Lamar College to a four-year state college. The initial attempt in 1947 was led in the Texas House of Representatives by Jack Brooks and in the Texas Senate by W. R. Cousins Jr., failed, but the following year the two sponsors again advanced the bill through both houses. On June 14, 1949, Governor Beauford Jester signed the bill creating Lamar State College of Technology.
Enrollment continued to grow throughout the 1950s and 1960s, reaching 10,000 students. Graduate work was authorized in 1960 when master&#x27;s degrees were offered in several fields. In 1969, Lamar State College opened its first branch at a center in Orange, Texas. In 1970, Lamar State College began offering its first doctoral program, the Doctor of Engineering. In 1971 the college&#x27;s name was officially changed to Lamar University.

A group of African-American veterans of World War II, barred from admission on the grounds of race and calling themselves the Negro Goodwill Council, protested to Governor Beauford Jester about the exclusion of blacks from Lamar State College. They attempted to block the passage of the bill to change Lamar into a state-supported senior college, which resulted in John Gray, Lamar&#x27;s president, creating a black branch of Lamar called Jefferson Junior College. It opened with evening classes at Charlton-Pollard High School. In 1952, James Briscoe, a graduate of Charlton-Pollard High School, applied to Lamar. His parents were laborers and members of the Beaumont chapter of the NAACP. The admissions office notified him that based on his transcript, he was qualified to enroll for the spring term of 1951. On January 29, when Briscoe went to register for classes, Lamar&#x27;s acting president G. A. Wimberly explained that a mistake had been made and suggested he apply to TSUN, now named Texas Southern University. State law, he said, created Lamar for whites only. In the summer of 1955, Versie Jackson and Henry Cooper Jr. became the lead plaintiffs of a class action lawsuit, Jackson v. McDonald, which sought to end Lamar&#x27;s policy of racial segregation. Lamar Cecil, federal judge, ruled on July 30, 1956, that Lamar&#x27;s &quot;white youth&quot; only admissions policy was unconstitutional, and that September, a total of twenty-six black students were admitted to the college amid violent protests at the campus gates and throughout the region which continued for several weeks until Texas Rangers arrived and the rule of law was restored.

In 1975, the university merged with Port Arthur College in Port Arthur, Texas, creating Lamar University–Port Arthur. In 1983, state Senator Carl A. Parker sponsored a bill creating the Lamar University System. In 1986, Lamar University–Orange and Lamar University–Port Arthur were granted accreditation separate from the main campus. Lamar Institute of Technology was created in 1990 in Beaumont to provide technical, business, health and industrial education through programs two years or fewer in length.

In 1995, the Lamar University System was incorporated into the Texas State University System. In the fall of 1998, the Lamar University faculty numbered 423 and student enrollment was 8,241. Total enrollment reached 15,000 students in Fall 2012. In the late 1990s, Lamar began undertaking campus improvement projects.

The $19 million center, named the Sheila Umphrey Recreational Sports Center, opened in April 2007.

In August 2007, the university completed construction on Cardinal Village IV, a $16 million expansion of its residence halls. The university completed construction of Cardinal Village Phase V in August 2010 bringing on-campus housing capacity to 2,500 students.

The university, in anticipation of the return of the football program in 2010, renovated and upgraded Provost Umphrey Stadium (formerly Cardinal Stadium) and a new state-of-the-art Dauphin Athletic Complex. In October 2014, Lamar broke ground for an administration building to be named the Wayne A. Reaud Building. The building houses the newly established Reaud Honors College. Another recent project included renovation of the Setzer Student Center. The renovation project had a $28 million cost. The renovated building was opened on April 12, 2018.

==Academics==
Lamar offers 96 undergraduate, 50 master&#x27;s and eight doctoral degree programs in seven academic colleges. The academic colleges are the College of Engineering, College of Education and Human Development, College of Business, College of Fine Arts and Communication, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Graduate Studies, and the Reaud Honors College. Lamar is classified as a Doctoral Research University by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education and is one of only two universities classified as such within the Texas State University System. Lamar and Kunming University of Science and Technology in southwest China have an exchange program that allows Chinese students to attend Lamar for one year while pursuing their bachelor&#x27;s degree.

The university also has many academic units that fall outside of the five main colleges. The College of Graduate Studies handles graduate students. The Center for Teaching and Learning Enhancement offers training and support to faculty and runs the university&#x27;s Active and Collaborative Engagement for Students (ACES) Program. The ACES program is designed to provide support to high-risk students and integrate active learning methods into all core courses at LU. The university also provides secondary education through the Texas Academy for Leadership in the Humanities, stateu.com and the Texas Governor&#x27;s School.

In the summer of 2009, Lamar University partnered with the University of Texas at Arlington to create an online dual credit program for high school students in Texas, stateu.com. The partnership between the two universities operates on the website stateu.com. Online dual credit courses are available for free to high school students through state funding via House Bill 3646.

==Athletics==
Lamar competes in the Southland Conference in NCAA Division I athletics for all of its varsity sports and at the NCAA Division I (FCS) subdivision level in football. Lamar has participated in practically every level of collegiate athletics from its inception as a junior college in 1923 to its gaining university status in 1971. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams are named the Cardinals and Lady Cardinals, respectively. The &quot;Lamar Cardinals&quot; (or &quot;Cards&quot;) refers to the collegiate athletic teams of Lamar University. The inception of the nickname &quot;Cardinals&quot; dates back to the school&#x27;s name change to Lamar in 1932.

Lamar fields teams in 17 sports sponsored by the Southland Conference. LU sponsors 17 teams (8 men&#x27;s and 9 women&#x27;s). The Cardinals participate in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track and field, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, women&#x27;s soccer, softball, women&#x27;s volleyball, baseball and football. The newest teams are the reinstated football team beginning in 2010, and women&#x27;s softball which began play in the 2013 season. A founding member of the Southland Conference, LU has competed in the conference in several stints ranging from 1963 to 1987, 1998 to 2021, and then again beginning in 2022 following a single year in the Western Athletic Conference. 

===Football===

Under former head coach Larry Kennan, his first team compiled a 6–3–2 record in 1979. LU set all-time attendance records under Kennan by averaging 16,380 fans in 1980. Games against Louisiana Tech (17,600) and Langston University (17,306) rank second and third, respectively, behind the standing-room-only 18,500 Baylor drew for the 1980 opener. The football program&#x27;s signature win came on September 5, 1981, in Waco with an 18–17 victory over the No. 20 (UPI) Baylor Bears. In 1987 LU football went independent to join the American South Conference, and the program was dropped altogether after 1989.
On January 30, 2008, 78% of LU students voted to approve the athletics fee required for football&#x27;s resurrection. This vote set in motion the football team&#x27;s return for the 2010 season. Regents of The Texas State University System approved the athletics fee to reinstate football at its regular meeting February 20, 2008. On May 19, 2008, Ray Woodard was chosen as head coach for the football program. Aided by a major gift from an anonymous donor, the football field now bears the name W.S. &quot;Bud&quot; Leonard Field, named for a former player and longtime Lamar advocate and regent.

After twenty seasons without a football team, the Lamar University Cardinals returned to the gridiron on September 4, 2010, and compiled a 5–6 record. The Cardinals opened Southland Conference play in 2011. The return of football to Lamar University was in part due to a major donation from Beaumont-based law firm Provost Umphrey. To help renovate the stadium, Walter Umphrey and his wife Sheila also made a personal donation; it is now Provost Umphrey Stadium.

In December 2016, Mike Schultz was named the program&#x27;s second head coach since its return. After recording just one winning record in its first nine seasons since being brought back, Schultz guided the Cardinals to a 7–5 record and a third-place finish in the Southland Conference in 2018, his second season. After a 1–4 start, LU closed the regular season by rattling off six straight wins to earn the program&#x27;s first berth in the NCAA FCS Playoffs. In the first round, Lamar fell at Northern Iowa by three points, 16–13.

===Basketball===
Founded in 1924, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams at Lamar have both advanced deep into the NCAA tournament. The men&#x27;s team has participated in four NITs and six NCAA tournaments, including four second-round appearances and one sweet 16 appearance. The women&#x27;s team has participated in four Women&#x27;s National Invitation Tournaments, two NCAA tournaments including one Elite Eight appearance.

The men&#x27;s program has been coached by fifteen head coaches including Billy Tubbs, Pat Foster, Pat Knight, Tic Price and Alvin Brooks, the current head coach. The women&#x27;s team has been coached by thirteen head coaches including Larry Tidwell, Robin, Harmony and current coach Aqua Franklin.

Over the years, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s programs have had the highest average attendance in the Southland Conference—both play in the 10,080-seat Montagne Center.

===Baseball===
The Lamar Cardinals baseball team represents Lamar University and competes in the Southland Conference at the NCAA Division I level. Current head coach Will Davis was hired from LSU in January 2016 to replace legendary coach Jim Gilligan. A former player, Gilligan guided the program for all but five seasons (1987–91) from 1973 through 2016. The LU Hall of Honor and Texas Baseball Hall of Fame member won more than 1,300 games during his career. The Cardinals baseball team leads the Southland Conference with ten regular-season titles and has participated in the NCAA Division I Regionals 13 times.

<text>A getter is a deposit of reactive material that is placed inside a vacuum system to complete and maintain the vacuum. When gas molecules strike the getter material, they combine with it chemically or by adsorption. Thus the getter removes small amounts of gas from the evacuated space. The getter is usually a coating applied to a surface within the evacuated chamber.

A vacuum is initially created by connecting a container to a vacuum pump. After achieving a sufficient vacuum, the container can be sealed, or the vacuum pump can be left running. Getters are especially important in sealed systems, such as vacuum tubes, including cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), vacuum insulating glass (or vacuum glass) and vacuum insulated panels, which must maintain a vacuum for a long time. This is because the inner surfaces of the container release adsorbed gases for a long time after the vacuum is established. The getter continually removes residues of a reactive gas, such as oxygen, as long as it is desorbed from a surface, or continuously penetrating in the system (tiny leaks or diffusion through a permeable material). Even in systems which are continually evacuated by a vacuum pump, getters are also used to remove residual gas, often to achieve a higher vacuum than the pump could achieve alone. Although it is often present in minute amounts and has no moving parts, a getter behaves in itself as a vacuum pump. It is an ultimate chemical sink for reactive gases.

Getters cannot react with inert gases, though some getters will adsorb them in a reversible way. Also, hydrogen is usually handled by adsorption rather than by reaction.

==Types==
To avoid being contaminated by the atmosphere, the getter must be introduced into the vacuum system in an inactive form during assembly, and activated after evacuation. This is usually done by heat. Different types of getter use different ways of doing this:
; Flashed getter: The getter material is held inactive in a reservoir during assembly and initial evacuation, and then heated and evaporated, usually by induction heating. The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, and then condenses on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating, the &quot;getter spot&quot; or &quot;getter mirror&quot;, which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low-power vacuum tubes.
; Non-evaporable getter (NEG): The getter remains in solid form.

==Flashed getters==

Flashed getters are prepared by arranging a reservoir of volatile and reactive material inside the vacuum system. After the system has been evacuated and sealed under rough vacuum, the material is heated (usually by radio frequency induction heating). After evaporating, it deposits as a coating on the interior surfaces of the system. Flashed getters (typically made with barium) are commonly used in vacuum tubes. Most getters can be seen as a silvery metallic spot on the inside of the tube&#x27;s glass envelope. Large transmission tubes and specialty systems often use more exotic getters, including aluminium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, strontium, caesium, and phosphorus.

If the getter is exposed to atmospheric air (for example, if the tube breaks or develops a leak), it turns white and becomes useless. For this reason, flashed getters are only used in sealed systems. A functioning phosphorus getter looks very much like an oxidised metal getter, although it has an iridescent pink or orange appearance which oxidised metal getters lack. Phosphorus was frequently used before metallic getters were developed.

In systems which need to be opened to air for maintenance, a titanium sublimation pump provides similar functionality to flashed getters, but can be flashed repeatedly. Alternatively, nonevaporable getters may be used.

Those unfamiliar with sealed vacuum devices, such as vacuum tubes/thermionic valves, high-pressure sodium lamps or some types of metal-halide lamps, often notice the shiny flash getter deposit and mistakenly think it is a sign of failure or degradation of the device. Contemporary high-intensity discharge lamps tend to use non-evaporable getters rather than flash getters.

Those familiar with such devices can often make qualitative assessments as to the hardness or quality of the vacuum within by the appearance of the flash getter deposit, with a shiny deposit indicating a good vacuum. As the getter is used up, the deposit often becomes thin and translucent, particularly at the edges. It can take on a brownish-red semi-translucent appearance, which indicates poor seals or extensive use of the device at elevated temperatures. A white deposit, usually barium oxide, indicates total failure of the seal on the vacuum system, as shown in the fluorescent display module depicted above.

===Activation===
The typical flashed getter used in small vacuum tubes &quot;(seen in 12AX7 tube, top)&quot; consists of a ring-shaped structure made from a long strip of nickel, which is folded into a long, narrow trough, filled with a mixture of barium azide and powdered glass, and then folded into the closed ring shape. The getter is attached with its trough opening facing upward toward the glass, in the specific case depicted above.

During activation, while the bulb is still connected to the pump, an RF induction heating coil connected to a powerful RF oscillator operating in the 27 MHz or 40.68 MHz ISM band is positioned around the bulb in the plane of the ring. The coil acts as the primary of a transformer and the ring as a single shorted turn. Large RF currents flow in the ring, heating it. The coil is moved along the axis of the bulb so as not to overheat and melt the ring. As the ring is heated, the barium azide decomposes into barium vapor and nitrogen. The nitrogen is pumped out and the barium condenses on the bulb above the plane of the ring forming a mirror-like deposit with a large surface area. The powdered glass in the ring melts and entraps any particles which could otherwise escape loose inside the bulb causing later problems. The barium combines with any free gas when activated and continues to act after the bulb is sealed off from the pump. During use, the internal electrodes and other parts of the tube get hot. This can cause adsorbed gases to be released from metallic parts, such as anodes (plates), grids, or non-metallic porous parts, such as sintered ceramic parts. The gas is trapped on the large area of reactive barium on the bulb wall and removed from the tube.

==Non-evaporable getters==

&quot;Non-evaporable getters&quot;, which work at high temperature, generally consist of a film of a special alloy, often primarily zirconium; the requirement is that the alloy materials must form a passivation layer at room temperature which disappears when heated.
Common alloys have names of the form St (Stabil) followed by a number:
*St 707 is 70% zirconium, 24.6% vanadium, and the balance iron.
*St 787 is 80.8% zirconium, 14.2% cobalt, and the balance mischmetal.
*St 101 is 84% zirconium and 16% aluminium.
In tubes used in electronics, the getter material coats plates within the tube which are heated in normal operation; when getters are used within more general vacuum systems, such as in semiconductor manufacturing, they are introduced as separate pieces of equipment in the vacuum chamber, and turned on when needed.
Deposited and patterned getter material is being used in microelectronics packaging to provide an ultra-high vacuum in a sealed cavity. To enhance the getter pumping capacity, the activation temperature must be maximized, considering the process limitations.

It is, of course, important not to heat the getter when the system is not already in a good vacuum.

<text>M.I.M.E.O. (or MIMEO) is an experimental electroacoustic free improvisation group formed in 1997 on the initiative of several independent concert promoters in Europe. The abbreviation stands for &quot;Music In Movement Electronic Orchestra&quot;. They have issued recordings on Erstwhile Records, Cathnor, Perdition Plastics, Grob, and other labels.

Their album &quot;Sight&quot; (2007) was inspired by painter Cy Twombly. Each of the eleven members of M.I.M.E.O. (spread across Europe) placed approximately five minutes of sound anywhere they chose onto a blank sixty-minute CDR. This was done independently of one another, with no communication between the musicians about how or where the music should be distributed on the disc. The CDRs were then compiled onto one CD and sent to a pressing plant.

Pianist John Tilbury joined the group to record the album &quot;The Hands of Caravaggio&quot; (2001, Erstwhile). Critic Brian Olewnick describes the album as &quot;A staggering achievement, one is tempted to call The Hands of Caravaggio the first great piano concerto of the 21st century.&quot;

<text>A voltage regulator is a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage. It may use a simple feed-forward design or may include negative feedback. It may use an electromechanical mechanism, or electronic components. Depending on the design, it may be used to regulate one or more AC or DC voltages.

Electronic voltage regulators are found in devices such as computer power supplies where they stabilize the DC voltages used by the processor and other elements. In automobile alternators and central power station generator plants, voltage regulators control the output of the plant. In an electric power distribution system, voltage regulators may be installed at a substation or along distribution lines so that all customers receive steady voltage independent of how much power is drawn from the line.

==Electronic voltage regulators==

A simple voltage/current regulator can be made from a resistor in series with a diode (or series of diodes). Due to the logarithmic shape of diode V-I curves, the voltage across the diode changes only slightly due to changes in current drawn or changes in the input. When precise voltage control and efficiency are not important, this design may be fine. Since the forward voltage of a diode is small, this kind of voltage regulator is only suitable for
low voltage regulated output. When higher voltage output is needed, a zener diode or series of zener diodes may be employed. Zener diode regulators make use of the zener diode&#x27;s fixed reverse voltage, which can be quite large.

Feedback voltage regulators operate by comparing the actual output voltage to some fixed reference voltage. Any difference is amplified and used to control the regulation element in such a way as to reduce the voltage error. This forms a negative feedback control loop; increasing the open-loop gain tends to increase regulation accuracy but reduce stability. (Stability is the avoidance of oscillation, or ringing, during step changes.) There will also be a trade-off between stability and the speed of the response to changes. If the output voltage is too low (perhaps due to input voltage reducing or load current increasing), the regulation element is commanded, &quot;up to a point&quot;, to produce a higher output voltage–by dropping less of the input voltage (for linear series regulators and buck switching regulators), or to draw input current for longer periods (boost-type switching regulators); if the output voltage is too high, the regulation element will normally be commanded to produce a lower voltage. However, many regulators have over-current protection, so that they will entirely stop sourcing current (or limit the current in some way) if the output current is too high, and some regulators may also shut down if the input voltage is outside a given range (see also: crowbar circuits).

== Electromechanical regulators ==


In electromechanical regulators, voltage regulation is easily accomplished by coiling the sensing wire to make an electromagnet. The magnetic field produced by the current attracts a moving ferrous core held back under spring tension or gravitational pull. As voltage increases, so does the current, strengthening the magnetic field produced by the coil and pulling the core towards the field. The magnet is physically connected to a mechanical power switch, which opens as the magnet moves into the field. As voltage decreases, so does the current, releasing spring tension or the weight of the core and causing it to retract. This closes the switch and allows the power to flow once more.

If the mechanical regulator design is sensitive to small voltage fluctuations, the motion of the solenoid core can be used to move a selector switch across a range of resistances or transformer windings to gradually step the output voltage up or down, or to rotate the position of a moving-coil AC regulator.

Early automobile generators and alternators had a mechanical voltage regulator using one, two, or three relays and various resistors to stabilize the generator&#x27;s output at slightly more than 6.7 or 13.4 V to maintain the battery as independently of the engine&#x27;s rpm or the varying load on the vehicle&#x27;s electrical system as possible. The relay(s) modulated the width of a current pulse to regulate the voltage output of the generator by controlling the average field current in the rotating machine which determines strength of the magnetic field produced which determines the unloaded output voltage per rpm. Capacitors are not used to smooth the pulsed voltage as described earlier. The large inductance of the field coil stores the energy delivered to the magnetic field in an iron core so the pulsed field current does not result in as strongly pulsed a field. Both types of rotating machine produce a rotating magnetic field that induces an alternating current in the coils in the stator. A generator uses a mechanical commutator, graphite brushes running on copper segments, to convert the AC produced into DC by switching the external connections at the shaft angle when the voltage would reverse. An alternator accomplishes the same goal using rectifiers that do not wear down and require replacement.

Modern designs now use &quot;solid state&quot; technology (transistors) to perform the same function that the relays perform in electromechanical regulators.

Electromechanical regulators are used for mains voltage stabilisation—see AC voltage stabilizers below.

== Automatic voltage regulator ==

Generators, as used in power stations, ship electrical power production, or standby power systems, will have automatic voltage regulators (AVR) to stabilize their voltages as the load on the generators changes. The first AVRs for generators were electromechanical systems, but a modern AVR uses solid-state devices. An AVR is a feedback control system that measures the output voltage of the generator, compares that output to a set point, and generates an error signal that is used to adjust the excitation of the generator. As the excitation current in the field winding of the generator increases, its terminal voltage will increase. The AVR will control current by using power electronic devices; generally a small part of the generator&#x27;s output is used to provide current for the field winding. Where a generator is connected in parallel with other sources such as an electrical transmission grid, changing the excitation has more of an effect on the reactive power produced by the generator than on its terminal voltage, which is mostly set by the connected power system. Where multiple generators are connected in parallel, the AVR system will have circuits to ensure all generators operate at the same power factor. AVRs on grid-connected power station generators may have additional control features to help stabilize the electrical grid against upsets due to sudden load loss or faults.

== AC voltage stabilizers ==

=== Coil-rotation AC voltage regulator ===
This is an older type of regulator used in the 1920s that uses the principle of a fixed-position field coil and a second field coil that can be rotated on an axis in parallel with the fixed coil, similar to a variocoupler.

When the movable coil is positioned perpendicular to the fixed coil, the magnetic forces acting on the movable coil balance each other out and voltage output is unchanged. Rotating the coil in one direction or the other away from the center position will increase or decrease voltage in the secondary movable coil.

This type of regulator can be automated via a servo control mechanism to advance the movable coil position in order to provide voltage increase or decrease. A braking mechanism or high-ratio gearing is used to hold the rotating coil in place against the powerful magnetic forces acting on the moving coil.

=== Electromechanical ===
Electromechanical regulators called &quot;voltage stabilizers&quot; or &quot;tap-changers&quot;, have also been used to regulate the voltage on AC power distribution lines. These regulators operate by using a servomechanism to select the appropriate tap on an autotransformer with multiple taps, or by moving the wiper on a continuously variable auto transfomer. If the output voltage is not in the acceptable range, the servomechanism switches the tap, changing the turns ratio of the transformer, to move the secondary voltage into the acceptable region. The controls provide a dead band wherein the controller will not act, preventing the controller from constantly adjusting the voltage (&quot;hunting&quot;) as it varies by an acceptably small amount.

=== Constant-voltage transformer === 

The ferroresonant transformer, ferroresonant regulator or constant-voltage transformer is a type of saturating transformer used as a voltage regulator. These transformers use a tank circuit composed of a high-voltage resonant winding and a capacitor to produce a nearly constant average output voltage with a varying input current or varying load. The circuit has a primary on one side of a magnet shunt and the tuned circuit coil and secondary on the other side. The regulation is due to magnetic saturation in the section around the secondary.

The ferroresonant approach is attractive due to its lack of active components, relying on the square loop saturation characteristics of the tank circuit to absorb variations in average input voltage. Saturating transformers provide a simple rugged method to stabilize an AC power supply.

Older designs of ferroresonant transformers had an output with high harmonic content, leading to a distorted output waveform. Modern devices are used to construct a perfect sine wave. The ferroresonant action is a flux limiter rather than a voltage regulator, but with a fixed supply frequency it can maintain an almost constant average output voltage even as the input voltage varies widely.

The ferroresonant transformers, which are also known as &quot;constant-voltage transformers&quot; (CVTs) or &quot;ferros&quot;, are also good surge suppressors, as they provide high isolation and inherent short-circuit protection.

A ferroresonant transformer can operate with an input voltage range ±40% or more of the nominal voltage.

Output power factor remains in the range of 0.96 or higher from half to full load.

Because it regenerates an output voltage waveform, output distortion, which is typically less than 4%, is independent of any input voltage distortion, including notching.

Efficiency at full load is typically in the range of 89% to 93%. However, at low loads, efficiency can drop below 60%. The current-limiting capability also becomes a handicap when a CVT is used in an application with moderate to high inrush current, like motors, transformers or magnets. In this case, the CVT has to be sized to accommodate the peak current, thus forcing it to run at low loads and poor efficiency.

Minimum maintenance is required, as transformers and capacitors can be very reliable. Some units have included redundant capacitors to allow several capacitors to fail between inspections without any noticeable effect on the device&#x27;s performance.

Output voltage varies about 1.2% for every 1% change in supply frequency. For example, a 2 Hz change in generator frequency, which is very large, results in an output voltage change of only 4%, which has little effect for most loads.

It accepts 100% single-phase switch-mode power-supply loading without any requirement for derating, including all neutral components.

Input current distortion remains less than 8% THD even when supplying nonlinear loads with more than 100% current THD.

Drawbacks of CVTs are their larger size, audible humming sound, and the high heat generation caused by saturation.

===Power distribution===

Voltage regulators or stabilizers are used to compensate for voltage fluctuations in mains power. Large regulators may be permanently installed on distribution lines. Small portable regulators may be plugged in between sensitive equipment and a wall outlet. Automatic voltage regulators on generator sets to maintain a constant voltage for changes in load. The voltage regulator compensates for the change in load. Power distribution voltage regulators normally operate on a range of voltages, for example 150–240 V or 90–280 V.

== DC voltage stabilizers ==
Many simple DC power supplies regulate the voltage using either series or shunt regulators, but most apply a voltage reference using a &quot;shunt regulator&quot; such as a Zener diode, avalanche breakdown diode, or voltage regulator tube. Each of these devices begins conducting at a specified voltage and will conduct as much current as required to hold its terminal voltage to that specified voltage by diverting excess current from a non-ideal power source to ground, often through a relatively low-value resistor to dissipate the excess energy. The power supply is designed to only supply a maximum amount of current that is within the safe operating capability of the shunt regulating device.

If the stabilizer must provide more power, the shunt output is only used to provide the standard voltage reference for the electronic device, known as the voltage stabilizer. The voltage stabilizer is the electronic device, able to deliver much larger currents on demand.

== Active regulators ==
Active regulators employ at least one active (amplifying) component such as a transistor or operational amplifier. Shunt regulators are often (but not always) passive and simple, but always inefficient because they (essentially) dump the excess current which is not available to the load. When more power must be supplied, more sophisticated circuits are used. In general, these active regulators can be divided into several classes:
* Linear series regulators
* Switching regulators
* SCR regulators

=== Linear regulators ===
&quot;Linear regulators&quot; are based on devices that operate in their linear region (in contrast, a switching regulator is based on a device forced to act as an on/off switch). Linear regulators are also classified in two types:
# series regulators
# shunt regulators

In the past, one or more vacuum tubes were commonly used as the variable resistance. Modern designs use one or more transistors instead, perhaps within an integrated circuit. Linear designs have the advantage of very &quot;clean&quot; output with little noise introduced into their DC output, but are most often much less efficient and unable to step-up or invert the input voltage like switched supplies. All linear regulators require a higher input than the output. If the input voltage approaches the desired output voltage, the regulator will &quot;drop out&quot;. The input to output voltage differential at which this occurs is known as the regulator&#x27;s drop-out voltage. Low-dropout regulators (LDOs) allow an input voltage that can be much lower (i.e., they waste less energy than conventional linear regulators).

Entire linear regulators are available as integrated circuits. These chips come in either fixed or adjustable voltage types. Examples of some integrated circuits are the 723 general purpose regulator and 78xx /79xx series

=== Switching regulators ===


Switching regulators rapidly switch a series device on and off. The duty cycle of the switch sets how much charge is transferred to the load. This is controlled by a similar feedback mechanism as in a linear regulator. Because the series element is either fully conducting, or switched off, it dissipates almost no power; this is what gives the switching design its efficiency. Switching regulators are also able to generate output voltages which are higher than the input, or of opposite polarity—something not possible with a linear design. In switched regulators, the pass transistor is used as a &quot;controlled switch&quot; and is operated at either cutoff or saturated state. Hence the power transmitted across the pass device is in discrete pulses rather than a steady current flow. Greater efficiency is achieved since the pass device is operated as a low-impedance switch. When the pass device is at cutoff, there is no current and it dissipates no power. Again when the pass device is in saturation, a negligible voltage drop appears across it and thus dissipates only a small amount of average power, providing maximum current to the load. In either case, the power wasted in the pass device is very little and almost all the power is transmitted to the load. Thus the efficiency of a switched-mode power supply is remarkably highin the range of 70–90%.

Switched mode regulators rely on pulse-width modulation to control the average value of the output voltage. The average value of a repetitive-pulse waveform depends on the area under the waveform. When the duty cycle is varied, the average voltage changes proportionally.

Like linear regulators, nearly complete switching regulators are also available as integrated circuits. Unlike linear regulators, these usually require an inductor that acts as the energy storage element. The IC regulators combine the reference voltage source, error op-amp, and pass transistor with short-circuit current limiting and thermal-overload protection.

Switching regulators are more prone to output noise and instability than linear regulators. However, they provide much better power efficiency than linear regulators.

=== SCR regulators ===
Regulators powered from AC power circuits can use silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) as the series device. Whenever the output voltage is below the desired value, the SCR is triggered, allowing electricity to flow into the load until the AC mains voltage passes through zero (ending the half cycle). SCR regulators have the advantages of being both very efficient and very simple, but because they can not terminate an ongoing half cycle of conduction, they are not capable of very accurate voltage regulation in response to rapidly changing loads. An alternative is the SCR shunt regulator which uses the regulator output as a trigger. Both series and shunt designs are noisy, but powerful, as the device has a low on resistance.

=== Combination or hybrid regulators ===
Many power supplies use more than one regulating method in series. For example, the output from a switching regulator can be further regulated by a linear regulator. The switching regulator accepts a wide range of input voltages and efficiently generates a (somewhat noisy) voltage slightly above the ultimately desired output. That is followed by a linear regulator that generates exactly the desired voltage and eliminates nearly all the noise generated by the switching regulator. Other designs may use an SCR regulator as the &quot;pre-regulator&quot;, followed by another type of regulator. An efficient way of creating a variable-voltage, accurate output power supply is to combine a multi-tapped transformer with an adjustable linear post-regulator.

== Example of linear regulators ==

=== Transistor regulator ===
In the simplest case a common base amplifier is used with the base of the regulating transistor connected directly to the voltage reference:
A simple transistor regulator will provide a relatively constant output voltage &quot;U&quot;out for changes in the voltage &quot;U&quot;in of the power source and for changes in load &quot;R&quot;L, provided that &quot;U&quot;in exceeds &quot;U&quot;out by a sufficient margin and that the power handling capacity of the transistor is not exceeded.

The output voltage of the stabilizer is equal to the Zener diode voltage minus the base–emitter voltage of the transistor, &quot;U&quot;Z − &quot;U&quot;BE, where &quot;U&quot;BE is usually about 0.7 V for a silicon transistor, depending on the load current. If the output voltage drops for any external reason, such as an increase in the current drawn by the load (causing an increase in the collector–emitter voltage to observe KVL), the transistor&#x27;s base–emitter voltage (&quot;U&quot;BE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again.

&quot;R&quot;v provides a bias current for both the Zener diode and the transistor. The current in the diode is minimal when the load current is maximal. The circuit designer must choose a minimum voltage that can be tolerated across &quot;R&quot;v, bearing in mind that the higher this voltage requirement is, the higher the required input voltage &quot;U&quot;in, and hence the lower the efficiency of the regulator. On the other hand, lower values of &quot;R&quot;v lead to higher power dissipation in the diode and to inferior regulator characteristics.

&quot;R&quot;v is given by

: formula_1
where
: min &quot;V&quot;&quot;R&quot; is the minimum voltage to be maintained across &quot;R&quot;v,
: min &quot;I&quot;D is the minimum current to be maintained through the Zener diode,
: max &quot;I&quot;L is the maximum design load current,
: &quot;h&quot;FE is the forward current gain of the transistor (&quot;I&quot;C/&quot;I&quot;B).

=== Regulator with a differential amplifier ===
The stability of the output voltage can be significantly increased by using a differential amplifier, possibly implemented as an operational amplifier:

In this case, the operational amplifier drives the transistor with more current if the voltage at its inverting input drops below the output of the voltage reference at the non-inverting input. Using the voltage divider (R1, R2 and R3) allows choice of the arbitrary output voltage between Uz and Uin.

== Regulator specification ==
The output voltage can only be held constant within specified limits. The regulation is specified by two measurements:
* Load regulation is the change in output voltage for a given change in load current (for example, &quot;typically 15 mV, maximum 100 mV for load currents between 5 mA and 1.4 A, at some specified temperature and input voltage&quot;).
* Line regulation or input regulation is the degree to which output voltage changes with input (supply) voltage changes—as a ratio of output to input change (for example, &quot;typically 13 mV/V&quot;), or the output voltage change over the entire specified input voltage range (for example, &quot;plus or minus 2% for input voltages between 90 V and 260 V, 50–60 Hz&quot;).

Other important parameters are:
* Temperature coefficient of the output voltage is the change with temperature (perhaps averaged over a given temperature range).
* Initial accuracy of a voltage regulator (or simply &quot;the voltage accuracy&quot;) reflects the error in output voltage for a fixed regulator without taking into account temperature or aging effects on output accuracy.
* is the minimum difference between input voltage and output voltage for which the regulator can still supply the specified current. The input-output differential at which the voltage regulator will no longer maintain regulation is the dropout voltage. Further reduction in input voltage will result in reduced output voltage. This value is dependent on load current and junction temperature.
* Inrush current or input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, instantaneous input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts for half a second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially if there is no inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.
* Absolute maximum ratings are defined for regulator components, specifying the continuous and peak output currents that may be used (sometimes internally limited), the maximum input voltage, maximum power dissipation at a given temperature, etc.
* Output noise (thermal white noise) and output dynamic impedance may be specified as graphs versus frequency, while output ripple noise (mains &quot;hum&quot; or switch-mode &quot;hash&quot; noise) may be given as peak-to-peak or RMS voltages, or in terms of their spectra.
* Quiescent current in a regulator circuit is the current drawn internally, not available to the load, normally measured as the input current while no load is connected and hence a source of inefficiency (some linear regulators are, surprisingly, more efficient at very low current loads than switch-mode designs because of this).
* Transient response is the reaction of a regulator when a (sudden) change of the load current (called the &quot;load transient&quot;) or input voltage (called the &quot;line transient&quot;) occurs. Some regulators will tend to oscillate or have a slow response time which in some cases might lead to undesired results. This value is different from the regulation parameters, as that is the stable situation definition. The transient response shows the behaviour of the regulator on a change. This data is usually provided in the technical documentation of a regulator and is also dependent on output capacitance.
* Mirror-image insertion protection means that a regulator is designed for use when a voltage, usually not higher than the maximum input voltage of the regulator, is applied to its output pin while its input terminal is at a low voltage, volt-free or grounded. Some regulators can continuously withstand this situation. Others might only manage it for a limited time such as 60 seconds (usually specified in the data sheet). For instance, this situation can occur when a three terminal regulator is incorrectly mounted on a PCB, with the output terminal connected to the unregulated DC input and the input connected to the load. Mirror-image insertion protection is also important when a regulator circuit is used in battery charging circuits, when external power fails or is not turned on and the output terminal remains at battery voltage.

<text>The University of Minnesota Morris (UMN–Morris) is a public liberal arts college in Morris, Minnesota, United States. It is part of the University of Minnesota system and was founded in 1960 as a public, co-educational, residential liberal arts college offering Bachelor of Arts degrees.

==History==

Although UMN Morris officially opened its doors in 1960, the history of what became the current institution reaches to 1887. That year, the first building of the Morris Industrial School for Indians, an American Indian boarding school founded by Mother Mary Joseph Lynch, was constructed on the site and run by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy under contract to the US government. Beginning in 1898, the Office of Indian Affairs (today&#x27;s Bureau of Indian Affairs) took over operations to introduce a more progressive curriculum. The school closed in 1909, under a congressionally authorized program to reduce the number of boarding schools in preference for locating schools on reservations, so that families and communities would not be broken up. The campus was transferred to the State of Minnesota under the agreement that American Indians would always be admitted free of tuition; the current UMN Morris still follows this policy.

In 1910 the University of Minnesota established a coeducational residential high school on the campus called the West Central School of Agriculture (WCSA). This was one of four such schools established by the university in outstate Minnesota to provide agricultural and home economics education to rural youth. The complex also included an agricultural research station. The WCSA operated for half a century, but declining enrollment in the late 1950s prompted the University of Minnesota to phase out its regional agricultural schools. The residents of the Morris region convinced the university to develop the campus as a four-year college. The University of Minnesota Morris opened in September 1960, phasing in college classes year by year while phasing out the last high school class, which graduated in 1963.

The only surviving building from the Morris Industrial School for Indians, an 1899 dormitory, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The oldest building on campus, it now serves as UMN Morris&#x27;s Multi-Ethnic Resource Center. In 2003 a historic district consisting of the dormitory and 10 buildings from the WCSA period was listed on the National Register as the West Central School of Agriculture and Experiment Station Historic District. It was listed for having national significance in the themes of agriculture and education. The district was nominated for being an excellent example of a residential agricultural high school, one of the longest running in the nation and one of the most intact. It was also a significant component of the University of Minnesota&#x27;s nationally influential system of such facilities, and an important contributor to education and agriculture in west-central Minnesota.

The WCSA campus buildings were mostly designed by state architect Clarence H. Johnston Sr. in American Craftsman style and built in the 1910s and 20s. The 11 contributing properties of the historic district consist of the Music Hall (1899, previously the Indian School boys&#x27; dormitory and now the Multi-Ethnic Resource Center), the Girls&#x27; Dormitory (1912, now Camden Hall), Spooner Hall (1912–13), the Cattle Barn (1914, now the Saddle Club Barn), the Engineering Building (1915, now the Welcome Center), the Dining Hall (1918, now Behmler Hall), Senior Hall (1920, now Blakely Hall), Agricultural Hall (1920–21, now John Q. Imholte Hall), the Infirmary (1923–24, now the Education Building), Junior Hall (1926, now Pine Hall), and the Seed House (1929).

==Academics==
Morris offers 35 majors and 32 minors, 13 education licensure areas, and nine pre-professional programs in education, the humanities, science and mathematics, and the social sciences.

According to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report,&quot; the five most popular majors on campus are Psychology, General; English Language and Literature, General; Biology/Biological Sciences, General; Business Administration and Management, General; and Economics, General.

In 2018, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked UMN Morris 155th in the &quot;National Liberal Arts Colleges&quot; list and #7 in &quot;Top Public Schools&quot; for Liberal Arts Colleges. &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked UMN Morris the #36 &quot;Best Bang for Your Buck&quot; school in 2014.

==Music==
The music discipline provides performing opportunities such as choir, symphonic winds, jazz ensembles, orchestra, and recitals.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMM Music Major/Minor Information&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual jazz festival was founded by Jim &quot;Doc&quot; Carlson in 1979. World-renowned jazz artists are invited to host clinics and master classes for high school, community, and college jazz ensemble. Each night of the festival concludes with performances by student jazz combos, ensembles, and the guest artists backed by Morris Jazz I.

==Green campus==
Morris is one of the first public colleges to generate on-site renewable power from local resources, such as corn stover. At the south edge of campus, a biomass gasification plant—fueled by crop residues from nearby farms—generates steam. The biomass gasifier is part of an integrated system for heating and cooling campus buildings. The combined heat and power system includes a steam turbine, which generates renewable electricity from gasifier steam, and a steam—powered absorption chiller.

At the campus&#x27;s Regional Fitness Center, locally manufactured solar thermal panels collect the sun&#x27;s energy to heat swimming pool water. A solar photovoltaic system on the south side of the science building converts sunlight into electricity. On the glacial ridge overlooking the campus, two 1.65 megawatt wind turbines generate renewable electricity for the campus and the region. Shifting to renewable power is just one piece of the campus&#x27;s comprehensive sustainability strategy. Other measures include historic building reuse, green building design and construction, conservation, local foods programs, hybrid vehicles, innovative curriculum, and community outreach.

In August 2013 the University of Minnesota Morris opened the Green Prairie Living and Learning Community. Construction on the building began in December 2012. The building is designed to house 72 students including 4 community advisors and a hall director. The building will house students during summer for special events and camps. There are kitchen facilities, a central lounge and patio, and study space. The Green Prairie Living and Learning Community was designed to meet Minnesota B3 sustainability guidelines and LEED Gold certification. It is constructed with high thermal mass insulated concrete forms (ICF) to prevent winter heat loss and summer heat gain. This is the first Residence Hall on the Morris campus to have suites.

In 2019, UMN Morris was ranked as the #1 campus in the United States for most renewable electricity generated on campus per full-time equivalent (FTE) student by Environment America.

==Athletics==
Minnesota–Morris (UMM) athletic teams are the Cougars. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Upper Midwest Athletic Conference (UMAC) since the 2003–04 academic year. The Cougars previously competed in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference (NSIC) of the NCAA Division II ranks from 1966–67 to 2002–03.

Minnesota–Morris competes in 17 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, and track &amp; field; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===History===
UMN Morris&#x27;s athletic teams have experienced varied success during the school&#x27;s history. The 1970s were marked by success in basketball and football. Olympic wrestler, Dennis Koslowski, wrestled for the Cougars in the early 1980s. In the early 1990s as a non-scholarship Division II, Cougar athletics found a more appropriate home in the UMAC of NCAA Division III. They are the first member of the UMAC to be a public, state-supported institution – all other members over the years were private institutions, usually with a religious affiliation.

In 1993, UMN Morris was the first college in the United States to sponsor women&#x27;s wrestling as an official varsity sport. The wrestling programs were cut in 2003 due to budget constraints. In 2006, a new men&#x27;s soccer team was announced.

===Football===
In 2006, UMN Morris opened a new football stadium named Big Cat Stadium, just south of the school&#x27;s Regional Fitness Center. BCS is also used by the Morris Area High School Tigers. The new stadium replaced Cougar Field which had been used from 1970 to 2005. The school&#x27;s first football field, named Miller Field, was used from 1961 to 1969.

In 2006, the Minnesota Morris Cougars football team captured their first UMAC championship in the Hubert H. Humphry Metrodome signaling the end of coach Ken Crandall&#x27;s coaching career at UMNM. The last conference title for the Cougar football program was the Northern Intercollegiate Conference (NIC) title in 1987, the second of two straight NIC titles. Over the next three years, the Cougars suffered losing records under coach Todd Hickman. In 2010, the team overcame their preseason rating (tied for last) to end the season with a winning record (5–4) and ending in a three-way tie for 3rd in the conference. 2016 record (4-6) 2017 record (6-4), undefeated at home.

==Media==
University students operate the radio station &quot;the U-90 alternative, the prairie&#x27;s only alternative&quot; 89.7 FM (KUMM). The university produces a television program that airs on PBS stations in the state. Pioneer Public Television carries &quot;Prairie Yard and Garden&quot;. UMN Morris also has a student-run publication, &quot;The University Register&quot;, a newspaper which is published weekly.

<text>The Texas State University System (TSUS) is a public university system in Texas. It was created in 1911 to oversee the state&#x27;s normal schools. It has since broadened its focus and comprises institutions of many different scopes.

It is the only public university system in the state without a flagship university. The TSUS is composed of four comprehensive universities offering baccalaureate and graduate degrees: Lamar University in Beaumont, Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Sul Ross State University in Alpine, and Texas State University in San Marcos. The system also includes three two-year colleges offering associate degrees and professional certifications: Lamar Institute of Technology in Beaumont, Lamar State College–Orange in Orange, and Lamar State College–Port Arthur in Port Arthur.

The Texas State University System saw its largest growth in 1995 when the Lamar University System with its four institutions was incorporated into the TSUS.

The Texas State University System is headquartered in Austin. The system is governed by a nine-member Board of Regents appointed by the governor of Texas. The administration is headed by a Board-appointed chancellor based in Austin.

The system owns and manages a property encompassing much of the Christmas Mountains located adjacent to Big Bend National Park in southern Brewster County. The remote tract is regulated under strict conservation easements ensuring preservation in its natural state. The property serves as an open-air classroom for the system&#x27;s member institutions and a laboratory for their research efforts.

==History==
The Texas Legislature established the State Normal School Board of Regents in 1911, which would later become the present-day Texas State University System, for the control and management of the state normal schools for white teachers. The board originally assumed authority over North Texas State Normal College (founded 1890), Sam Houston Normal Institute (1879), Southwest Texas Normal School (1899), and West Texas State Normal College (1909).

The Legislature authorized the establishment of Sul Ross Normal College and the purchase of the private East Texas Normal College, founded in 1889, in 1917 That same year, the Legislature authorized the renaming of the system&#x27;s normal schools to normal colleges. Political struggles for the creation of Stephen F. Austin Normal College and South Texas Normal College (Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville) were resolved in 1921. Further legislation in 1923 renamed the system&#x27;s members again to state teachers colleges while the board was renamed the Board of Regents, State Teachers Colleges. South Texas left the system in 1929 to be governed independently as Texas Arts and Industrial College (Texas A&amp;I) before eventually joining the Texas A&amp;M University System as Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville.

Sul Ross and West Texas received name changes in 1949 becoming Sul Ross State College and West Texas State College. North Texas would leave the system the same year becoming independently governed North Texas State College. North Texas would later become the flagship campus of the University of North Texas System. Similar name changes would result in Southwest Texas State College in 1959 and Sam Houston State College in 1965. West Texas State College became West Texas State University in 1963.

The year 1965 also saw the incorporation of Angelo State College, founded as a junior college in 1928, into the system. With these changes, the board became titled the Board of Regents, State Senior Colleges. All of the system&#x27;s components had their names changed from state colleges to state universities in 1969 while East Texas (Texas A&amp;M-Commerce) and West Texas (West Texas A&amp;M) left the system entirely in 1969 to become independent before settling on their present affiliations with the Texas A&amp;M University System. Stephen F. Austin left the system the same year and continued to be an independent with its separate governing regents outside any of the state&#x27;s other university systems, until 2023, when its regents elected to join the University of Texas System.

Sul Ross established upper-division and post-graduate study centers in 1973 on campuses of Southwest Texas Junior College in Del Rio, Eagle Pass, and Uvalde.

The Legislature conferred upon the system in 1975 its present designation as the Texas State University System. Angelo State University was re-designated as a member along with Sam Houston State University, Southwest Texas State University, and Sul Ross State University.

In the most transformative change to the TSUS in its history, the Lamar University System was abolished in 1995 and its four members were incorporated into the TSUS: Lamar University (founded 1923), Lamar Institute of Technology (1995), Lamar University Orange (1969), and Lamar University Port Arthur (1909).

Southwest Texas State opened an extension center in 1996 housed in temporary buildings adjacent to a Round Rock high school. After a 2004 land donation, the permanent Texas State University Round Rock Campus was opened in 2005.

Sam Houston State opened The Woodlands University Center in 1998. The following year, the former Lamar campuses in Orange and Port Arthur were renamed Lamar State College Orange and Lamar State College Port Arthur.

In 2003, the Legislature changed the name of Southwest Texas State to Texas State University-San Marcos. The name was shortened to Texas State University in 2013.

Angelo State University left the system to affiliate with the Texas Tech University System in 2007 in the most recent change in system membership.

Sam Houston State operated an additional branch, the University Park Campus at Lone Star College–University Park near Tomball from 2011 until it was discontinued at the beginning of 2016.

===Membership timeline===
 

==Administration==
The Texas Legislature has delegated administrative power and authority over the Texas State University System to its board of regents including the organization, control, and management of the system and each of its component institutions including employing and discharging the presidents, officers, and other employees of each member institution.

The board consists of nine voting regents, including its chair and vice chairs. Members of the board are appointed by the governor with Senate confirmation to staggered, six-year terms with three regents appointed every two years. In addition, a non-voting student regent is appointed annually. The chair and vice chair are elected by the membership of the board to one-year terms.

The chief executive officer of the university system is the chancellor, who also serves as secretary to the Board of Regents without being a member of the Board. The chancellor is appointed without a fixed term by a majority of the board of regents and serves at the pleasure of the board. The chancellor has ultimate authority and responsibility over all system components including recommending the hiring and firing of the presidents of system institutions, maintaining the permanent records of the system, and advising, assisting, and representing the board in administrative matters.

The current chancellor of the Texas State University System is Brian McCall, a former legislator in the Texas House of Representatives.

The system&#x27;s administration consists of six offices. One office, the Office of Audits and Analysis, is independent of the chancellor and headed by a director appointed by the regents. The remaining five, Academic and Health Affairs, Finance, General Counsel, Governmental Relations, and Marketing and Communications, are led by vice chancellors under the authority of the system chancellor.

===Headquarters===
O. Henry Hall in Downtown Austin serves as the administrative headquarters of the TSUS. In 2015, system regents approved the acquisition of O. Henry Hall from the University of Texas System. O. Henry Hall is a former U.S. post office and federal building and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This was done so that there was a single administrative building for the system. TSUS paid $8.2 million for O. Henry Hall.

The system headquarters was previously in the Thomas J. Rusk State Office Building, 200 East 10th Street, Suite 600, in Downtown Austin, and it occupied space in two other state office buildings in Downtown. In 2015, within those three buildings, TSUS had 24 full-time employees.

==Comparison of present and former component institutions==
The member institutions of the Texas State University system are separate and distinct institutions, have their own local presidents and administration, confer their own degrees, and establish their own criteria and requirements for admission, subject to approval by the Board of Regents.

===Universities===

The TSUS does not have a flagship university. All of its comprehensive universities are regarded as stand-alone institutions equal in stature under system administration.

The University of North Texas and West Texas A&amp;M University were founding members of the Texas State University System along with Sam Houston State and Texas State.

;Note
===State colleges===

All three of the TSUS&#x27; two-year institutions offering associate degrees and professional certifications are located in the state&#x27;s two most southeastern counties, Jefferson and Orange, in the Golden Triangle region where the Gulf Coast meets the Louisiana state line. All were formerly components of the now-defunct Lamar University System before the former system was incorporated into the TSUS. The three institutions, along with LIT&#x27;s extension center in Silsbee located in Hardin County, are within the Beaumont–Port Arthur metropolitan area.
===Branch campuses and extension centers===

Branch locations of the system&#x27;s comprehensive universities only offer upper-division (junior and senior) undergraduate and graduate coursework.
*Lamar Institute of Technology extension center in Silsbee, Texas at the Frank Robinson Center
*Sam Houston State University The Woodlands Center on the Lone Star College–Montgomery campus in The Woodlands
*Sul Ross State University branch campus locations:
**Del Rio campus of Southwest Texas Junior College
**Eagle Pass campus of Southwest Texas Junior College
**Uvalde campus of Southwest Texas Junior College
*Texas State University Round Rock Campus in Round Rock
Sam Houston State formerly operated the Sam Houston State University Park Campus at Lone Star College-University Park near Tomball.

<text>Ľubor Kresák (23 August 1927 in Topoľčany – 20 January 1994 in Bratislava) was a Slovak astronomer.

He discovered two comets: the periodic comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak and the non-periodic C/1954 M2 (Kresak-Peltier).
He also suggested in 1978 that the Tunguska event was a fragment of the periodic comet Encke.

The asteroid 1849 Kresák was named in his honor.

His wife Margita Kresáková was also an astronomer.

<text>William Melton (died 5 April 1340) was the 43rd Archbishop of York (1317–1340) and the first Lord Privy Seal.

== Life ==

Melton was the son of Nicholas of Melton, and the brother of Henry de Melton, and John Melton. He was born in Melton in the parish of Welton, about nine miles from Kingston upon Hull. He was a contemporary of John Hotham, Chancellor of England and Bishop of Ely. The two prelates were often associated in public matters and were the most powerful churchmen of their period in England.

Melton was Controller of the Wardrobe at the accession of Edward II in 1307 and was a pluralist through and through at the time of his elevation to the see of York. Among other things, he was also Archdeacon of Barnstaple and Provost of Beverley. He was Lord Privy Seal from 1307 to about 1312, having been Dean of St. Martin&#x27;s-le-Grand at that time also. He was promoted to Keeper of the Household Wardrobe from 1314 to 1316. He was elected by the chapter of York within a month of Archbishop Greenfield&#x27;s death, in December 1315, but difficulties arose and he was not consecrated until September 1317, at Avignon by Pope John XXII. While serving as archbishop, Melton had to deal with numerous cases of fugitive or rebellious nuns at the Benedictine nunnery St Clement&#x27;s by York, most notably Joan of Leeds.

Throughout Melton&#x27;s archiepiscopate, he was actively concerned with the affairs of Scotland. Between 1318 and 1322, the Scots, under James Douglas, Lord of Douglas, made raids into Yorkshire, devastating great parts of the country, destroying churches and sacking the richest monasteries. These continued raids led to a dispute between the City of York and Melton regarding the responsibility for the upkeep of part of the city&#x27;s motte and bailey defences known as the Old Baile. During the raid of 1319, the King was at the siege of Berwick and much of the trained soldiery was there with him. Archbishop Melton collected what men he could and led them against the Scots. Clergy, friars and citizens of York were accordingly gathered and the result was the Battle of Myton (12 October 1319) on the Swale, in which the English were entirely routed. Queen Isabella, who was in York at the time, managed to escape to safety at Nottingham. So many clergy died, mainly trying to swim the River Swale to escape, that Scots referred to it as the Chapter of Myton. 

Connected with the Scottish raids of 1322 was the battle of Boroughbridge, in which the Earl of Lancaster was taken prisoner, led from Boroughbridge to his own castle of Pontefract and there beheaded. Archbishop Melton had aided Lancaster at one point, and seems, in consequence, to have fallen into some disfavour with Edward II. By 1325 however, the King&#x27;s good opinion had been recovered, since Melton then became Lord Treasurer of England until 1326.

Melton did not desert Edward II in his latter days, regarding his imprisonment with great displeasure. Nor was he present at the coronation of Edward III, and is said afterwards to have been engaged in a dangerous intrigue to upset the new government, for which he was arrested, though acquitted. In January 1328, Melton married the young king to Philippa of Hainault. In 1330 he was reappointed Treasurer, but left the office in 1331.

=== Work and legacy === 
Melton completed the building of the nave of York Minster and his figure still remains above the great western portal. He is said to have assisted largely in building St. Patrick&#x27;s Church, Patrington, in Holderness, and certainly gave much toward the fabric of Beverley Minster. He died on 5 April 1340 at Cawood Palace, and was buried in the north aisle of the nave at York Minster, a memorial window installed shortly after his death being transferred to St James&#x27; Church, High Melton in the 1790s by the Dean of York, John Fountayne.

Melton died very wealthy, having custody of many manors and estates. His heir was his nephew, William Melton of Aston, near Sheffield, who was the progenitor of one of the most powerful knightly families in the south of Yorkshire.

Melton kept a detailed log of his activities while he was Archbishop of York, published as &quot;The Register of William Melton&quot; in five volumes.

<text>The Mercedes-Benz W201 is the internal designation for the Mercedes 190 series sedans, a range of front-engine, rear drive, five passenger, four-door sedans manufactured over a single generation, from 1982 to 1993 as the company&#x27;s first compact class automobile.

Designed by Bruno Sacco, head of styling at Mercedes-Benz from 1975 to 1999, the W201 debuted at the 1982 Paris Motor Show. Manufactured in both Bremen and Sindelfingen, Germany, production reached 1,879,629 over its eleven-year model life.

The W201 introduced a 5-link rear suspension subsequently used in E and C class models, front and rear anti-roll bars, anti-dive and anti-squat geometry—as well as airbags, ABS brakes and seatbelt pretensioners. Its extensive use of light-weight high-strength steel enabled it to withstand a concrete barrier offset crash at 35 mph (56 km/h) without serious passenger injury or cabin deformation.

Mercedes introduced a performance variant, marketed as the 190 E 2.3-16V, at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show.

==Background==
From January 1974 to January 1982, Mercedes spent over £600 million researching and developing the W201, subsequently saying it was &#x27;massively over-engineered&#x27;. The company began testing early prototypes in 1978, with final styling approved on 6 March 1979. The first prototypes based on that design were tested later that year, with pilot production beginning in February 1982, following engineering sign-off. The W201-based 190 was unveiled on 8 December 1982, and launched in Germany on 9 December 1982. It was marketed in right-hand drive for the UK market from September 1983.

When difficulties prevented Daimler from manufacturing the W201 in Bremen, production began in Sindelfingen at a capacity of just 140,000 units per year. Bremen was subsequently cleared for W201 production, replacing the commercial production.

The 190 E (E for Einspritzung, or Fuel Injection) model uses the Bosch KE-Jetronic Multi-Point Fuel Injection to meter fuel instead of the carburetor of 190 models. Thanks to their fuel injection system and larger intake and exhaust valves, 190 E models made more power than non-fuel injected 190 models. In April 1990, the carbureted 190 was discontinued and replaced by a fuel injected, 1.8-liter version at the bottom of the range.

For the 1991 model year, the W201 received light exterior modifications. For instance, the door frames were now painted body color rather than being anodized black as before. The last Mercedes-Benz 190E was manufactured on 17 May 1993.

==Petrol models==
In 1982, the first available models were the 190 and 190 E. Each was fitted with an M102 inline-4 engine. The 190 was fitted with an M102.921 engine producing and the 190 E fitted with an M102.962 engine producing . In September 1983, the 190 E 2.3 (2,299 cc) was launched for the North American market only (although 190 E 2.3 was available for purchase in other countries later), fitted with a M102.961 engine. This reduction in power was due to the emissions standards in the North American market at the time. The intake manifold, camshaft, and fuel injection system were refined in 1984, and the engine produced . The carbureted 190 was revised in 1984 as well, receiving a power increase to . 1984 also saw the arrival of the 2.3-16 &quot;Cosworth&quot; variant.

In 1985, the 190 E 2.3 now came fitted with the M102.985 engine, producing until it was revised in 1987, now using the Bosch KE3-Jetronic Injection system, a different ignition system, and a higher compression ratio, producing .

The Frankfurt International Motor Show in September 1985 also marked the arrival of the first 190 equipped with an Inline-six engine. Fitted with a M103.940 engine, the 190 E 2.6 had a maximum power output of with a catalytic converter and without it. In the North American market, the 190 E 2.6 was sold until 1993, the end of the W201&#x27;s production run. From 1992–1993 the 2.6 was available as a special &quot;Sportline&quot; model, with an upgraded suspension and interior. The 190 E 2.3 was sold until 1988, then went on a brief hiatus until it was sold again from 1991 until 1993.

In 1990, Mercedes Benz phased out the carburetor-equipped 190, replacing it with fuel-injected 190E 1.8. This model utilised a M102.910 engine, with the same bore but shorter stroke than the M102.962, and produced the same power output as the outgoing 190 model, albeit with only torque.

==Diesel models==

The 190 D was available with three different engines. The 2.0 L inline-four engine was the base engine, and was never marketed in North America. A 2.2-liter version, with the same power as the 2.0 L, was introduced in September 1983. It was only available in model years 1984 and 1985, and only in the US and Canada. The 2.5 L inline-five engine was available in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The 2.5 L Turbo engine, sold in mainland Europe, but not the UK for many years, was available to American buyers only in 1987 and is now somewhat of a collectors item. The exterior of the 2.5 Turbo model is different from other models in that it has fender vents in the front passenger side fender to feed air to the turbocharger.

==Limited editions==
=== 190 LE ===
For the UK and Irish market, a special edition 190 was produced for the 1993 model year. The car was given the badge name 190LE, though on the rear boot lid it read 190 E (on the left hand side of the lock) and LE on the right hand side. Roughly 1,000 cars were produced and each one came with a large A3 sized certificate giving each car a unique number.

The 190 LE was available in three colours only; Azzuro Blue (blue/purple), Brilliant Silver and Rosso Red (Burgundy). The Azzuro blue coloured cars came with a grey checked cloth interior, the silver coloured cars with a black checked cloth interior and the Rosso Red coloured cars with a biscuit/cream checked cloth interior.

The LE was equipped with extra features that had been options on the other models and were only available with the 1.8 or 2.0-litre engine. Both the 1.8 and 2.0-litre models were equipped with a standard electric tilt and slide steel sunroof, four electric windows, electric aerial, 8-hole alloy wheels, Blaupunkt Verona CR43 Radio/cassette player and walnut wood trim (as opposed to Zebrano wood). The 2.0-litre version had in addition rear headrests and a front armrest. The LE was nearly £3,500 cheaper than a 1.8-litre model of identical specification, and £2,000 cheaper than a 2.0-litre model.

No further options could be added to LE cars from the factory - though some were equipped with other dealer-installed items.

=== 180 E ===

In Australia, a limited run of 180 E Limited Edition cars could be purchased from October 1991 to March 1994. This was essentially a 1.8-litre 190 E with a very basic trim. At its launch, Mercedes-Benz were able to price the 180 E at , compared to the 190 E at . This was achieved by taking out equipment and also by offsetting import duties with the now discontinued policy of export credits gained through using Australian-made components for the whole Mercedes-Benz range, such as suspension springs and windscreen glass. The 180 E deleted anti-lock brakes, power windows, climate control, electric seats, heated mirrors, cruise control and multi-speaker sound system; although power steering, air conditioning and central locking remained standard.

=== 190 E Limited Edition ===
In 1993, for the U.S. market, 2 LE models were offered, limited to 1,400 units (700 190 E 2.3 LE and 700 190 E 2.6 LE). Both the 2.3 and 2.6 Limited Editions had a rear badge deletion meaning that the &quot;190E&quot; and &quot;2.3&quot; or &quot;2.6&quot; chrome badges on the trunk lid were not added. The 2.3 LE was only offered in Emerald Green while the 2.6 was only offered in Black. The 2.3 litre were only produced in Brilliant Emerald Pearl color. The 2.3 LE comes with 15-inch 8-hole alloy wheels, cream beige leather upholstery, burl walnut trim on the entire dash, fully electric front seats, rear headrests, and headlamp wipers with a washing system. The 2.6 litre Black Sportline included Recaro seats with red inserts and red piping, rear matching headrests, carbon fiber trim, Sportline gear shift, a sportier steering wheel, headlight wipers, low profile tires, eight spoke rims, and a Sportline tuned suspension which added tighter handling and lowered the car by a quarter inch. The suspension was the same suspension as the 190E Cosworth.

==190 E 2.3-16 and 2.5-16==


In the late 1970s, Mercedes competed in rallying with the big V8-powered Coupés of the R107 Series, mainly the light-weight Mercedes 450 SLC 5.0. Mercedes wished to take the 190 E rallying, and asked British engineering company Cosworth to develop an engine with for the rally car. This project was known as project WAA by Cosworth. During this time, the Audi Quattro with its all-wheel drive system and a turbocharged engine was launched, making the 2.3-16 appear outclassed. With a continued desire to compete in motorsports with the 190, and also now an engine to do it with, Mercedes turned to the Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft (DTM) (German Touring Car Championship) motor sport series instead. Cars racing in this championship, however, had to be based on a roadgoing model. Mercedes therefore had to put into series production a 190 fitted with a detuned version of the Cosworth engine. The performance model was known as the 190 E 2.3-16, and debuted in September at the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show, after its reputation had already been established. Three cars, only slightly cosmetically altered, had set three world records in August at the Nardo testing facility in Italy, recording a combined average speed of over the 50,000 km endurance test, and establishing twelve international endurance records.

===Engine===

The Cosworth engine was based on the M102 four cylinder 2.3-litre 8-valve unit producing , already fitted to the 190 and E-Class. Cosworth developed the cylinder head. It was made from light alloy using Cosworth&#x27;s unique casting process and brought with it dual overhead camshafts and four valves per cylinder, meaning 16 valves total which were developed to be the &quot;largest that could practically be fitted into the combustion chamber&quot;.

In roadgoing trim, the 2.3 L 16-valve engine generated a maximum power output of at 6,200 rpm and at 4,500 rpm. The oversquare 95.50 x 80.25 mm bore and stroke dimensions ensured that the car could easily rev up to the 7,000 rpm redline. Acceleration from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) was in less than eight seconds, and the top speed was 230 km/h (143 mph).

US-Specification cars had a slightly reduced compression ratio (9.7:1 instead of 10.5:1), and were rated at at 5,800 rpm and at 4,750 rpm.

The road-going version of the engine was reconfigured with reduced inlet and exhaust port sizes, different camshaft profiles, no dry sump configuration and Bosch K-Jetronic replacing the specialised Kugelfischer fuel injection. These changes helped bring power down to the required specification, but still resulted in a &quot;remarkably flexible engine, with a very flat torque curve and a wide power band&quot;. The heads for the engines were cast at Cosworth&#x27;s Coscast foundry in Worcester and sent to Germany to be fitted to the rest of the engine, parts of which were different from the standard 2.3-litre engine including light pressed alloy pistons, and rings designed to withstand higher engine speeds, whilst con-rods, bearings and bearing caps were found to be strong enough as standard and left unaltered.

====16V AMG power pack====
Available only to 2.5-16 and Evolution I models, the optional AMG Power Pack increased power to at 7,200 rpm and torque to at 5,000 rpm, while pushing the top speed up to . In their final incarnations, these engines produced up to in racing tune.

===2.5 L model===

An enlarged 2.5 L engine replaced the 2.3 L in 1988. It offered double-row timing chains to fix the easily snapping single chains on early 2.3 engines, and increased peak output by with a slight increase in torque. For the European market, the car delivered up to without a catalytic converter (but prepared for retrofitting one, called &quot;RÜF&quot;). Catalytic converter cars equipped with the 2.5-litre 16V engine generated a slightly reduced power output of . Cosworth also list the project code &quot;WAB&quot; for the development of the 2.5-16-valve head just as they do for the 2.3-16-valve head.

===16v differences===
Due to their performance, the 16-valve cars were different from the other 190 models. The body kit on the 2.3-16 and 2.5-16 reduced the drag coefficient to 0.32, one of the lowest CD values on a four-door saloon of the time, whilst also reducing lift at speed. The steering ratio was quicker and the steering wheel smaller than that on other 190s, whilst the fuel tank was enlarged from 55 to 70 L. The Getrag 5-speed manual gearbox was unique to the 16-valve and featured a dog-leg change pattern, shifting left and down for first. The gearchange quality was, however, noted as &quot;notchy, balky&quot;, criticisms which weren&#x27;t levelled at the BMW M3 (E30) which shared the same gearbox. An oil cooler was fitted to ensure sufficient oil cooling for the inevitable track use many of these cars were destined for.

The strictly four-seater interior had standard sport size seats with strong side bolsters for front and rear passengers. Three extra dials - an oil temperature gauge, stopwatch and voltmeter - were included in the centre console. The 190 E 2.3-16 was available in only two colours, Blue-Black metallic (Pearl Black in the US), and Smoke Silver. The 2.5-16 added Almandine Red and Astral Silver.

All 2.3-16-valve 190 models are fitted with a Limited Slip Differential (LSD) as standard. They were also available with Mercedes&#x27; ASD system which was standard equipment on the 2.5-16v. The ASD is an electronically controlled, hydraulically locking differential which activates automatically when required. The electronic control allows varied amounts of differential lock from the standard 15% right up to 100%. It is not a traction control system however, and can only maximize traction rather than prevent wheel spin. Activation of the ASD system is indicated by an illuminating amber triangle in the speedometer.

The suspension on 16-valve models is modified from the standard 190 (W201). As well as being lower and stiffer, it has quicker dampers, larger anti-roll bars, harder bushings and hydraulic Self-levelling suspension (SLS) on the rear. This allows the rear ride height to remain constant even when the car is fully loaded.

The 1984 Nürburgring Race of Champions, featuring current and former F1 drivers at the wheel of identical 190 E&#x27;s, was held at the inauguration of the new, shorter Nürburgring. A then unknown Ayrton Senna took first place.

Private Teams such as AMG later entered the 2.3-16 in touring cars races, especially the DTM. In the late 1980s, the 2.5-16 (never released in the United States) raced many times, against the similar BMW M3 and even the turbocharged Ford Sierra RS Cosworth.

==Evolution models==
===Evolution I===

With the debut of the BMW M3 Evolution 2 in March 1988, the 190 E&#x27;s direct competitor, it became obvious that the 2.5-16 needed a boost in power in order to remain competitive. In March 1989, the 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution debuted at the Geneva Auto Show. The Evo I, as it came to be called, had a new rear spoiler and wider wheel arches. Many changes were made to under-the-skin components such as brakes and suspension. The car featured an adjustable suspension system allowing the ride height to be adjusted from an interior switch. All were intended to allow the Evolution cars to be even more effective around a track.

The Evo I&#x27;s power output is similar to the of the &quot;regular&quot; 2.5-16. However, it had a redesigned engine of similar capacity but most importantly, a shorter stroke and bigger bore which would allow for a higher rev limit and improved generation of power. Additional changes stretch to improved rotating mass, improved lubrication system along with improved cam timing. Cosworth also list a project code &quot;WAC&quot; for the development of the short-stroke Evolution engine.

Only 502 units of the Evolution model were produced for homologation in compliance with the DTM rules. For those customers desiring even more performance, a PowerPack option engineered by AMG was available for DM 18,000. The PowerPack option included improved camshafts, a larger diameter throttle body, more responsive ignition and fuel management system as well as improved intake and exhaust systems - it was only offered with twin, metal catalytic converters rather than the single ceramic one used in the regular 2.5. The net result was an increase in power by over the standard car, bringing the total to .
===Evolution II===
In March 1990, at the Geneva Auto Show, the 190 E 2.5-16 Evolution II was shown. This car retailed in 1990 for DM 136,720.

The &quot;Evo II&quot; included the AMG PowerPack fitted to the same short-stroke inline-four engine as the Evolution, producing a maximum power output of at 7,200 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm, as well as a full SLS adjustable suspension allowing the ride height to be adjusted from an interior switch. An obvious modification to the Evolution II was the radical body kit (designed by Prof. Richard Eppler from the University of Stuttgart) with a large adjustable rear wing, rear window spoiler, and Evolution II 17-inch alloy wheels. The kit served an aerodynamic purpose—it was wind tunnel tested to reduce drag to 0.29, while at the same time increasing downforce. Period anecdotes tell of BMW research and development chief, Wolfgang Reitzle, saying &quot;the laws of aerodynamics must be different between Munich and Stuttgart; if that rear wing works, we&#x27;ll have to redesign our wind tunnel.&quot; The anecdote claims that BMW did redesign its wind tunnel afterwards.

500 examples were painted in &quot;blauschwarz&quot; blue/black metallic; the last two examples, numbers 501 and 502, were painted in astral silver making them the rarest of the Evolution models. The Evo II had the shortest production run of the 190 series models with production starting in 1990 and ending in 1991.

* Since August 1983. ** Getrag&#x27;s dog-leg.

==AMG models==

AMG was not part of Mercedes-Benz when the 190 was first produced, but a separate racing and tuning company. As AMG had racing experience in the DTM, they were tuning all the factory petrol engines for the customers and 190 E was one of them. Engine tuning added over the standard car. Along with that aerodynamic features were added to the cars such as rear spoilers and front splitters in order to improve high speed stability, alloy wheels and a leather interior.

===190 E 3.2 AMG===

The 190 E 3.2 AMG was the first model sold through AMG authorized re-seller with a Mercedes-Benz new car warranty. About 200 complete cars were made. They were offered in black or silver and were very expensive (about DM 155,780). Besides 200 complete 190 E 3.2 AMG&#x27;s, Mercedes-Benz sold AMG body kits and 3.2 L AMG engines separately, so there are 190&#x27;s fitted with those features at the factory or retrofitted. The 190 E 3.2 AMG straight-six 12-valve engines are derived from the 2.6-litre M103 engine and generate a maximum power output of , enabling the car to attain a top speed of .

==Mercedes 190 D BlueEFFICIENCY (2009)==
The 190 D BlueEFFICIENCY is an experimental vehicle demonstrating the improvements made in Diesel engine technology over the last 20 years, in isolation from the equally profound changes in the safety and comfort of the car as a whole. It was based on a 1988 190 E 2.6 which was fitted with a Mercedes-Benz OM651 engine, rated at and at 1,600–1,800 rpm. The 190 D Blue EFFICIENCY accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 6.2 seconds, with fuel efficiency of 4.9 litres per 100 kilometres (NEDC). By comparison, the original car has the fuel efficiency of 7.3 litres per 100 kilometres. The 190 D BlueEFFICIENCY was also compared to C 250 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY, which has fuel efficiency of 5.1 litres per 100 kilometres via NEDC method, despite the modern C 250 CDI BlueEFFICIENCY being 385 kg heavier, 16 cm longer, and around 9 cm wider and higher than a 190.

==Mercedes-Benz 190 E Elektro (1990)==
The 190 E Elektro was a limited series of fully electric variants of the Mercedes-Benz W201. Back in May 1990, Mercedes revealed a fully electric 190 E at the Hannover Fair. This wasn&#x27;t a typical concept for Mercedes as the carmaker wanted to use the 190E platform for testing different drive configurations and battery packs. These included mainly sodium-nickel chloride or sodium-sulphur batteries, which offered a much higher energy density than the era&#x27;s more classic lead packs. At the 1991 Geneva Motor Show they even brought a more advanced version of the 190E ‘Electro’, showcasing their commitment to the project. The electric 190E retained the cabin space of the regular ICE model unaffected, as well as all its safety features. The Geneva show car featured two DC permanent magnet motors, one for each rear wheel, with a combined peak power output of 44 HP. As for the driving range, the electric 190 E offered 110 km (68 miles) on a full charge. The Mercedes 190 E Electro used a sodium-nickel chloride battery and a regenerative braking system to help charge the pack during driving. Mercedes also took out many of the weight-intensive mechanical components in order to offset the weight penalty of the heavy batteries; the result was an electric car that weighed just 200 kg (440 lbs) more than the model it&#x27;s based on. As for the driving range, Mercedes even participated in a large-scale field trial on the German island of Rügen between 1992 and 1996, with the support of the local government. They wanted to test electric cars and their powertrains in everyday conditions and Mercedes sent 10 hand-built 190 E Electro cars which featured various electric motors and battery configurations. Some of them had no transmission at all while others even featured a manual transmission in combination with their electric powertrains. Special recharging stations with solar collectors were also installed on the island to test the concept of EVs in a consistent -neutral manner. Overall a total of 60 cars and vans from different brands were involved in the EV trial. The cars were tested by different participants, including taxi drivers, who used them in their normal lives. According to Mercedes, there were hardly any problems, with the test cars showcasing excellent reliability. One of the vehicles even achieved a usage rate of 100,000 km in one year (62,000 miles).

<text>Maureen Castaneda was the director of Foreign Exchange and Sovereign Risk Management for Enron Corporation.

== Enron story ==
Maureen Castaneda was laid off from Enron and took a box of shredded paper home to use as packing material. She then realized that the papers meant that Enron employees were illegally destroying evidence. She stated the shredding started in 2001 around Thanksgiving. The shredded papers were marked with Chewco and Jedi, two questionable partners of Enron. The New York Times, along with other news outlets, depicted her claim as a &quot;woman scandal&quot;.

Castenada said the documents were shredded in the accounting office starting sometime in October until January when she left the company. On January 22, 2002 she stated that Enron had been shredding documents in its Houston headquarters the previous week. Following her claim, the FBI raided the Houston office of Enron the next day to investigate the allegations.

<text>God in Three Persons is a rock opera and concept album by American art rock group the Residents, released in 1988. It is about a man—arbitrarily named &#x27;Mr. X&#x27;—who befriends two conjoined twins. The songs are all sung in a rhythmic spoken word fashion, similar to talking blues. The entire lyrical content of the album is written in trochaic octameter, a rare poetic meter most famously used in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s poem &quot;The Raven&quot;. A central motif of the album is the organ riff from &quot;Double Shot (Of My Baby&#x27;s Love)&quot; by 1960s frat rock band the Swingin&#x27; Medallions. A companion soundtrack album, featuring most of the instrumental backing tracks, was also released.

&quot;God in Three Persons&quot; received a 5-star rating from AllMusic.

==Storyline==
The album is the story of a Colonel Tom Parker-type character called &quot;Mr. X&quot;, who finds a pair of conjoined twins who have miraculous healing powers. He convinces them to let him manage their careers, touring them as holy healers and conducting services during which they cure the masses. Mr. X begins to lust after the &quot;female&quot; twin, then realizes that the twins&#x27; sexes are fluid rather than fixed. When he discovers that the twins are far more worldly than he had believed, and therefore less under his control, he plots a vicious rape in which he severs the connection between the two, splitting them forever. In the denouement, he realizes that his feelings for the twins were not being imposed on him by the twins, but came from within himself.

The story is narrated in the first person by Mr. X. He is accompanied throughout by instrumental music and sung commentary by Laurie Amat, who acts as a &quot;Greek Chorus&quot; (and sings the opening credits on the first track).

== Live performances ==
Starting in May 2019, the Residents undertook a short tour performing exclusively tracks from the album, beginning at a Residents-themed event at Bourges, France, with a significantly shortened version of the album.

The next performances of the show were in January 2020, featuring a significantly reworked and more theatrical set design. The first of these performances was a public dress rehearsal at The Lab in San Francisco, the rehearsal was received well, earning a favourable review from &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

An updated performance, which took place at the Museum of Modern Art, received considerably more attention than the band&#x27;s usual output, being reviewed by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Brooklyn Vegan&quot;, and &quot;The Art Forum&quot;.

<doc id="624265" wikidata="Q1757985" url="?curid=624265" title="Dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway">
<text>The dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway (DCML) (also known as the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway (PCML) is the major sensory pathway of the central nervous system that conveys sensations of fine touch, vibration, two-point discrimination, and proprioception (body position) from the skin and joints. It transmits this information to the somatosensory cortex of the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe of the brain. The pathway receives information from sensory receptors throughout the body, and carries this in the gracile fasciculus and the cuneate fasciculus, tracts that make up the white matter dorsal columns (also known as the posterior funiculi) of the spinal cord. At the level of the medulla oblongata, the fibers of the tracts decussate and are continued in the medial lemniscus, on to the thalamus and relayed from there through the internal capsule and transmitted to the somatosensory cortex. The name dorsal-column medial lemniscus comes from the two structures that carry the sensory information: the dorsal columns of the spinal cord, and the medial lemniscus in the brainstem.

There are three groupings of neurons that are involved in the pathway: first-order neurons, second-order neurons, and third-order neurons. The first-order neurons are sensory neurons located in the dorsal root ganglia, that send their afferent fibers through the two dorsal columns. The first-order axons make contact with second-order neurons of the dorsal column nuclei (the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus) in the lower medulla. The second-order neurons send their axons to the thalamus. The third-order neurons are in the ventral posterolateral nucleus in the thalamus and fibres from these ascend to the postcentral gyrus.

Sensory information from the upper half of the body is received at the cervical level of the spinal cord and carried in the cuneate tract, and information from the lower body is received at the lumbar level and carried in the gracile tract. The gracile tract is medial to the more lateral cuneate tract.

The axons of second-order neurons of the gracile and cuneate nuclei are known as the internal arcuate fibers and when they cross over the midline, at the sensory decussation in the medulla, they form the medial lemniscus which connects with the thalamus; the axons synapse on neurons in the ventral posterolateral nucleus which then send axons to the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe. All of the axons in the DCML pathway are rapidly conducting, large, myelinated fibers.

==Structure==
The DCML pathway is made up of the axons of first, second, and third-order sensory neurons, beginning in the dorsal root ganglia. The axons from the first-order neurons form the ascending tracts of the gracile fasciculus, and the cuneate fasciculus (the dorsal columns) which synapse on the second-order neurons in the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus known together as the dorsal column nuclei; axons from these neurons ascend as the internal arcuate fibers; the fibers cross over at the sensory decussation and form the medial lemniscus which connects with the thalamus; the axons synapse on neurons in the ventral nuclear group which then send axons to the postcentral gyrus in the parietal lobe.

The gracile fasciculus carries sensory information from the lower half of the body entering the spinal cord at the lumbar level. The cuneate fasciculus carries sensory information from the upper half of the body (upper limbs, trunk, and neck) entering the spinal cord at the cervical level. The gracile fasciculus is wedge-shaped on transverse section and lies next to the posterior median septum. Its base is at the surface of the spinal cord, and its apex directed toward the posterior gray commissure. The gracile fasciculus increases in size from inferior to superior.

The cuneate fasciculus is triangular on transverse section, and lies between the gracile fasciculus and the posterior column, its base corresponding with the surface of the spinal cord.
Its fibers, larger than those of the gracile fasciculus, are mostly derived from the same source, viz., the posterior nerve roots.
Some ascend for only a short distance in the tract, and, entering the gray matter, come into close relationship with the cells of the dorsal nucleus, while others can be traced as far as the medulla oblongata, where they end in the gracile nucleus and cuneate nucleus.

The two ascending tracts meet at the level of the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6). Ascending tracts typically have three levels of neurons, namely first-order, second-order, and third-order neurons, that relay information from the physical point of reception to the actual point of interpretation in the brain.
===First-order neurons===
====Periphery and spinal cord====
When an action potential is generated by a mechanoreceptor in the tissue, the action potential will travel along the peripheral axon of the first-order neuron. The first-order neuron is pseudounipolar in shape with its body in the dorsal root ganglion. The action signal will continue along the central axon of the neuron through the posterior root, into the posterior horn, and up the posterior column of the spinal cord.

Axons from the lower body enter the posterior column below the level of T6 and travel in the midline section of the column called the gracile fasciculus. Axons from the upper body enter at or above T6 and travel up the posterior column on the outside of the gracile fasciculus in a more lateral section called the cuneate fasciculus. These fasciculi are in an area of white matter, the posterior funiculus (a funiculus) that lies between the posterolateral and the posterior median sulcus. They are separated by a partition of glial cells which places them on either side of the posterior intermediate sulcus.

The column reaches the junction between the spinal cord and the medulla oblongata, where lower body axons in the gracile fasciculus connect (synapse) with neurons in the gracile nucleus, and upper body axons in the cuneate fasciculus synapse with neurons in the cuneate nucleus.

First-order neurons secrete substance P in the dorsal horn as a chemical mediator of pain signaling. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord transmits pain and non-noxious signals from the periphery to the spinal cord itself. Adenosine is another local molecule that modulates dorsal horn pain transmission 

===Second-order neurons===
====Brainstem====
The neurons in these two nuclei (the dorsal column nuclei) are second-order neurons. Their axons cross over to the other side of the medulla and are now named as the internal arcuate fibers, that form the medial lemniscus on each side. This crossing over is known as the sensory decussation.

At the medulla, the medial lemniscus is orientated perpendicular to the way the fibres travelled in their tracts in the posterior column. For example, in the column, lower limb is medial, upper limb is more lateral. At the medial lemniscus, axons from the leg are more ventral, and axons from the arm are more dorsal. Fibres from the trigeminal nerve (supplying the head) come in dorsal to the arm fibres, and travel up the lemniscus too.

The medial lemniscus rotates 90 degrees at the pons. The secondary axons from neurons giving sensation to the head, stay at around the same place, while the leg axons move outwards.

The axons travel up the rest of the brainstem, and synapse at the thalamus (at the ventral posterolateral nucleus for sensation from the neck, trunk, and extremities, and at the ventral posteromedial nucleus for sensation from the head).

===Third-order neurons===
====Thalamus to cortex====
Axons from the third-order neurons in the ventral posterior nucleus in the thalamus, ascend the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Those originating from the head and the leg swap their relative positions. The axons synapse in the primary somatosensory cortex, with lower body sensation most medial (e.g., the paracentral lobule) and upper body more lateral.

==Function==
Discriminative sensation is well developed in the fingers of humans and allows the detection of fine textures. It also allows for the ability known as haptic perception (stereognosis), to determine what an unknown object is, using the hands without visual or audio input. Fine touch is detected by cutaneous receptors called tactile corpuscles that lie in the dermis of the skin close to the epidermis. When these structures are stimulated by slight pressure, an action potential is started. Alternatively, proprioceptive muscle spindles and other skin surface touch mechanoreceptors such as Merkel cells, bulbous corpuscles, lamellar corpuscles, and hair follicle receptors (peritrichial endings) may involve the first neuron in this pathway.

The sensory neurons in this pathway are pseudounipolar, meaning that they have a single process emanating from the cell body with two distinct branches: one peripheral branch that functions somewhat like a dendrite of a typical neuron by receiving input (although it should &quot;not&quot; be confused with a true dendrite), and one central branch that functions like a typical axon by carrying information to other neurons (again, both branches are actually part of one axon).

==Clinical significance==
Damage to the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway below the crossing point of its fibers results in loss of vibration and joint sense (proprioception) on the same side of the body as the lesion. Damage above the crossing point result a loss of vibration and joint sense on the opposite side of the body to the lesion. The pathway is tested with Romberg&#x27;s test.

Damage to either of the dorsal column tracts can result in the permanent loss of sensation in the limbs. See Brown-Séquard syndrome.

==Additional information==
The cuneate fasciculus, fasciculus cuneatus, cuneate tract, tract of Burdach, was named for Karl Friedrich Burdach. The gracile fasciculus, the tract of Goll, was named after Swiss neuroanatomist Friedrich Goll (1829–1903).

<text>Sherron Watkins (born August 28, 1959) is an American former Vice President of Corporate Development at the Enron Corporation. Watkins discovered and reported the 2001 Enron scandal to Enron&#x27;s then-CEO Kenneth Lay.

Watkins was selected as one of three &quot;Persons of the Year 2002&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, alongside two other whistleblowers, Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom and Coleen Rowley of the FBI.

==Early life and education==
Watkins was born in Tomball, Texas. Watkins holds a Bachelor of Business Administration (with honors) from the University of Texas, where she was a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority, and a Master in Professional Accounting, also from the McCombs School of Business. Watkins is a Certified Public Accountant with retired status.

==Career==

Watkins began her career in 1982 at Arthur Andersen as an auditor. She spent eight years at Andersen in both the Houston and New York offices. She joined New York-based MG Trade Finance in 1990 to manage their portfolio of commodity-backed finance assets until October 1993. She joined Enron in 1993.

In August 2001, Watkins alerted Lay of accounting irregularities in financial reports. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;Enron began an inquiry, but it failed to use independent investigators and her claims were largely dismissed.&quot; Watkins was later criticized for not reporting the fraud to government authorities and not speaking up publicly sooner about her concerns, as her memo did not reach the public until five months after it was written. Watkins was represented by Houston attorney Philip H. Hilder.

Watkins was called to testify before committees of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate at the beginning of 2002, primarily about her warnings to Enron&#x27;s then-CEO Kenneth Lay about accounting irregularities in the financial statements.

In 2004, Watkins released a book about her experiences at Enron and the problems of US corporate culture, &quot;Power Failure: The Inside Story of the Collapse of Enron&quot;.

<text>Zdeňka Vávrová (born 1945) is a Czech astronomer.

She co-discovered periodic comet 134P/Kowal-Vávrová. She had observed it as an asteroid, which received the provisional designation 1983 JG, without seeing any cometary coma. However, later images by Charles T. Kowal showed a coma. The Minor Planet Center credits her with the discovery of 115 numbered minor planets.

The Florian main-belt asteroid 3364 Zdenka, discovered by Antonín Mrkos in 1984, was named in her honor and for the 20 years she had been participating in Kleť Observatory&#x27;s minor planet astrometry program. Naming citation was published on 26 February 1994 ().

<text>Neihu District is a district of Taipei City, Taiwan. Neihu means &quot;inner lake.&quot; The older name originates from the Ketagalan word &quot;Tayour&quot; (transliterated by the Dutch as &quot;Cattajo&quot;), meaning woman&#x27;s head ornament.

Many mountainous roads and paths, which are ideal for hiking, connect Neihu with the neighboring Shilin District and Yangmingshan National Park. The Tri-Service General Hospital, which is a teaching hospital of the National Defense Medical Center, is also in Neihu. The Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery borders Neihu.

==History==
During Japanese rule, Naiko Village () covered modern day Neihu in addition to Nangang. The village was under Shichisei District, Taihoku Prefecture.

==Economy==

Although it was a flood-prone region, Neihu has experienced huge growth with the construction of the Neihu Technology Park in 1995 and hypermarkets such as Costco, RT Mart, Carrefour, B&amp;Q. The extension of the Taipei Metro to Neihu in the 1990s and early 2000s has also boosted residential and commercial growth. TransAsia Airways, Delta Electronics and RT-Mart have their headquarters in the district. Neihu is the location of the Garena e-Sports Stadium, which is host to the League of Legends Masters Series, the premier &quot;League of Legends&quot; esports professional video game league in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.

== Topography ==
Straightening of the Keelung River, which runs along Neihu&#x27;s southern and eastern borders has changed the natural boundaries of the district at several points in the latter 20th century.

<text>Emil Gustav Hirsch (May 22, 1851 – January 7, 1923) was a Luxembourgish-born Jewish American biblical scholar, Reform rabbi, contributing editor to numerous articles of &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; (1906), and founding member of the NAACP.

==Biography==
Emil Gustav Hirsch was born in Luxembourg City, a son of the rabbi and philosopher Samuel Hirsch on May 22, 1851. He later married the daughter of Rabbi David Einhorn. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1872 went to Berlin for post-graduate work. He was rabbi at Har Sinai Congregation in Baltimore (1877–78), and in Louisville, Kentucky (1878–80). But he did his greatest work in Chicago.

For forty-two years (1880–1923), Hirsch served as the rabbi of Chicago Sinai Congregation, one of the oldest synagogues in the Midwest. At this post, he became well known for an emphasis on social justice. From Chicago Sinai&#x27;s pulpit, he delivered rousing sermons on the social ills of the day and many Chicagoans, Jews and Gentiles alike, were in attendance.

Appointed professor of rabbinical literature and philosophy at the University of Chicago in 1892, Hirsch also served on the Chicago Public Library board from 1885 to 1897. He took some part in politics as a member of the Republican Party.

He was an influential exponent of advanced thought and Reform Judaism. He edited &quot;Der Zeitgeist&quot; (Milwaukee, 1880–82) and the &quot;Reform Advocate&quot; (1891–1923). He also edited the Department of the Bible of the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; and contributed feminist articles to &quot;The American Jewess&quot;. He also wrote studies of the historical relationship between Judaism and Christianity, including appreciations of its founding figures Jesus and Paul. In addition, he published a number of articles for the Reform Advocate, a weekly journal which he edited for thirty years.

From 1872 to 1876, he studied at the Universities of Berlin and Leipzig. Returning to America, he married Mathilda Einhorn in Louisville, Kentucky. Here, he remained until his death on January 7, 1923.

Hirsch left a legacy as a renowned preacher in American Jewry. Many scholarly articles in the Jewish Encyclopedia were contributed by him. His social and philanthropic pursuits were a valuable contribution.

Hirsch is the namesake of the Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School of Communications, located in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood in Chicago. In keeping with his interest in education, Hirsch advised a wealthy congregant, Julius Rosenwald of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., to use part of his wealth to help build public schools for black students in the segregated South; their facilities were consistently underfunded. The rural school building program, based on the use of matching funds from local communities, was one of the largest programs, but not the only, administered by the Rosenwald Fund.

He was a presidential elector in the 1896 presidential election.

He was the maternal grandfather of U.S. Attorney General Edward Hirsch Levi.

<text>A milblog or warblog is a blog devoted mostly or wholly to covering news events concerning an ongoing war. Sometimes the use of the term &quot;warblog&quot; implies that the blog concerned has a pro-war slant. The term &quot;milblog&quot; implies that the author is a member of, or has some connection to the military; the more specific term &quot;soldierblog&quot; is sometimes used for the former.

==History==
The coinage &#x27;warblog&#x27; is attributed to Matt Welch, who started his &quot;War Blog&quot; within days of the September 11 attacks. In the fall of 2001, the attacks gave rise to a &quot;war-blogging movement,&quot; which favoured political punditry over the often personal and technological orientation that had dominated the blog genre up to that point, achieving much greater public and media recognition than earlier blogs. Most warblogs supported the US-led War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War from a hawkish perspective.

Milblogging was popularized by Glenn Reynolds, whose &quot;Instapundit&quot; was one of the most popular political blogs on the web. Some prominent milblogs, such as &quot;Little Green Footballs&quot; by Charles Johnson and &quot;Daily Dish&quot; by Andrew Sullivan existed before September 11, but made the war on terror their primary focus afterwards. Other notable milblogs included &quot;Dynamist&quot; by Virginia Postrel, &quot;KausFiles&quot; by Mickey Kaus, &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; by Josh Marshall, &quot;KenLayne.com&quot; by Ken Layne, and &quot;Lileks.com&quot; by James Lileks.

The readership of milblogs dramatically increased in March 2003, following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with readers chiefly attracted by the offer of perspectives absent from most news reports; the pseudonymous Salam Pax, an Iraqi national who was posting first-hand accounts from Baghdad, emerged as a prominent war blogger. Media organisations that started their own reporters&#x27; milblog at this point included the BBC, the Christian Science Monitor, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. In the first half of 2003, CNN, &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot; were among the media organizations that prohibited staff reporters from covering US-led wars first-hand in their personal blogs for fear both of legal repercussions and of competition from such blogs.

Most blogs that gained popularity as &quot;warblogs&quot; expanded their focus to politics and general news, usually from a right-of-center perspective, yet continued to be commonly known as warblogs. While milblogs arose in response to the post-September-11 wars and mostly limited their commentary to them, some moved on to related political, social and cultural issues and continued after the end of the wars.

===Milblogs===
Military blogs emerged with the Iraq War in 2003. Initially named &quot;warblogs&quot; as well, they became popular under the name &quot;milblogging&quot; in 2004. In October 2005, a U.S. soldier named Jean-Paul Borda launched the blog aggregator Milblogging.com. A milblog is primarily focused on the events of the military, written about by those with inside knowledge of the military, whether an active soldier, a veteran of the military, a spouse of a soldier, or a civilian with a special connection to the military.

Milblogs often criticized the media coverage of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, seeking to correct what they saw as biased or negative reporting. Thus, Matt Burden of Blackfive.net cites as the rationale of his blog the death in combat of a fellow soldier and good friend of his, who died saving the life of a magazine reporter, yet had his death go unreported by the magazine. One milblogger chose to offer his site &quot;as an educational service to the American People who wish to know the true story of Iraq and Afghanistan.&quot; Other milblogs cite similar intentions to report the news that they did not feel the mainstream media was reporting.

C.J. Grisham was among the first active duty soldiers to become a milblogger when he opened &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Perspective&quot; in December 2004. Within five years, ASP was receiving an average of 1,500 visitors per day (nearly 1 million in total) from over 120 countries and was ranked the second most popular site on Milblogging.com.

In 2005, there were fewer than 200 &quot;milblogs&quot; in existence. In July 2011, Milblogging.com listed more than 3,000 military blogs in 46 countries. The top 5 locations were US, Iraq, Afghanistan, the United Kingdom, and Germany. During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian milblogs became increasingly popular.

==Response by governments==

===United States===
Military blogs became accepted within a few years. Whereas Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was at first believed to be skeptical of military blogs, by 2007 president George W. Bush lauded them as &quot;an important voice for the cause of freedom.&quot;

Official oversight of websites maintained by military personnel deployed to the Middle East began in 2002. The oversight mission consisted of active-duty soldiers and contractors, as well as Guard and Reserve members from Maryland, Texas and Washington state. Its remit was expanded in August 2005.

In Iraq, commanding officers shut down a blog that reported on the medical response to a suicide bombing that had taken place in late 2004 in Mosul. The Army Web Risk Assessment Cell was created to monitor compliance with military regulations. In April 2005, a four-page document of regulations was issued by Multi-National Corps-Iraq, directing all military bloggers in Iraq to register with their units, and commanders to conduct quarterly reviews to make sure bloggers were not disclosing casualty numbers or violating operational security or privacy rules. Some milbloggers took down or altered their blogs for fear of violating the regulation that many of them believed to be too ambiguous. The regulations were updated in April 2007 but, according to many bloggers in war theatres, failed to resolve their ambiguities.

Although the U.S. Department of Defense was initially concerned about milblogs as a potential OPSEC violation, it eventually embraced the concept and attempted to implement official versions of milblogs. Official milblogs did not receive the same reception or popularity of the unofficial milblogs as they were written in the same dull language as other official publications of the Defense Department.

===Russia===
In Russia, milbloggers (sometimes called &quot;voenkory&quot;, &quot;war correspondents&quot;) have gained prominence during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing a greater level of information about the war than is available from state media. Blogs range from those affiliated with state media, which often provided information more in-line with that of government positions, to independent and Wagner Group-affiliated blogs which are more critical of the Russian military establishment&#x27;s performance in Ukraine. These blogs are notable for their ultranationalist and pro-war views. The Institute for the Study of War attributed their popularity to the Russian government&#x27;s failure to establish an effective social media presence as well as its failure in preparing the Russian public for a drawn-out war. The Russian government has protected them from calls for censorship and has selectively granted positions to nationalist and pro-war milbloggers due to their importance in the ultranationalist constituency which Vladimir Putin&#x27;s presidency has become increasingly reliant upon. Putin himself has met with prominent milbloggers aligned with state-media to discuss military matters. However, since September 2023, the Russian government arrested a number of high-profile milbloggers, which some have seen as a crackdown on the community.

<text>The Pompton River is a tributary of the Passaic River, approximately long, in Passaic County in northern New Jersey in the United States.

It is formed south of the borough of Pompton Lakes by the confluence of the Ramapo and Pequannock rivers. It flows south, passing between Lincoln Park and Pequannock Township (to the west) and Wayne (to the east). It enters the Passaic north of Fairfield Township at an area called Two Bridges. Its watershed encompasses a section of the Ramapo Mountains along the New York-New Jersey border in the rural suburbs of New York City. It is the main tributary by volume of the Passaic. A portion of the river&#x27;s water is diverted to the nearby Wanaque Reservoir.

The low-lying flat areas of Pompton Plains in Pequannock Township are prone to flooding from the Pompton River. In the wake of the heavy rains from Hurricane Irene in August 2011, the river overflowed, cresting at a record level of on August 29, causing flooding that displaced hundreds of residents.

The proposed Passaic River Flood Tunnel would alleviate flooding by taking water from the Pompton River in Wayne and sending it through a tunnel measuring in diameter for the to Newark Bay.

<doc id="624284" wikidata="Q3487692" url="?curid=624284" title="Asiatic Society of Japan">
<text>The Asiatic Society of Japan, Inc. (一般社団法人日本アジア協会” or “Ippan Shadan Hojin Nihon Ajia Kyokai”) or &quot;ASJ&quot; is a non-profit organization of Japanology. ASJ serves members of a general audience that have shared interests in Japan.

Founded in 1872 as , ASJ is Japan&#x27;s oldest learned society. The Honorary Patron is Hisako, Princess Takamado. The Representative Director and President as of September 2019 is H.E. Ambassador Yoshinori Kato.

==Overview==
The Asiatic Society of Japan&#x27;s founders set into motion coordinated activities &quot;to collect and publish information on subjects relating to Japan and other Asiatic Countries.&quot; They intentionally differentiated ASJ from its affiliated Royal Asiatic societies of the day by having established ASJ as a &quot;Society for scholarly gentlemen&quot; rather than a society of scholars. Nor was &quot;Royal&quot; to be used in ASJ&#x27;s title, a measure to encourage Japanese people to join. Women also began to join within a few years. ASJ quickly became the first organization of its kind in Japan to promote the sharing of discoveries about Japan to the rest of the world.

ASJ was founded at a meeting held on 8 October 1872 at the Grand Hotel, Yokohama, when Robert Grant Watson of the British Legation was elected the first President, and the first papers were read there on 30 October—&quot;Notes on Loochoo&quot; by Ernest Mason Satow, then Japanese Secretary at the British Legation, and &quot;The Hyalonema Mirabilis&quot;, a marine biological study by Henry Hadlow, a Royal Navy surgeon. The opening papers were significant for two reasons: the subjects themselves, and the presence of James Curtis Hepburn and Satow at the very beginning of the ASJ&#x27;s life.

ASJ&#x27;s founders and earliest members were adventurous leaders who became pillars of Japan&#x27;s modernization and industrialization at the dawn of Meiji Period. Physicians, scientists, teachers, engineers, military officers, lawyers, and diplomats numbered among them. In those days, there were numerous organizations like ASJ, each in their own way serving as focal points for documenting and discussing the discoveries that were being made by the men who were participating in the building of a new Japan. Many members of ASJ were also members of the other organizations.

Japanese members who were central to the Meiji Restoration included: Kanō Jigorō, , Tsuda Sen, Nakamura Masanao, and Viscount Mori Arinori.

The &#x27;foreign expert&#x27; group included James Curtis Hepburn, Josiah Conder; John Milne, Edward Divers, James Main Dixon and Charles Dickinson West, all of the Imperial College of Engineering; Henry Faulds of the Tsukiji Hospital; Robert Maclagan of the Osaka Mint; Basil Hall Chamberlain; William George Aston, and Ernest Mason Satow.

ASJ trained a generation of Japanese teachers and students, making the &#x27;foreign experts&#x27; superfluous. By the 1890s, ASJ&#x27;s first generation of Japanese and foreign members—leaders of change in Meiji—began to move on. Academicians began to make-up more of the membership. Today, the membership is approximately: academicians (46%); businesspeople (36%); students, fine arts, clergy, retired and other (18%).

ASJ is still active today. Members meet monthly to hear a guest explain discoveries based on original research. The lectures last approximately fifty minutes and are followed by questions and discussion. Topics have come from the full spectrum of fields of knowledge as related to Japan, including culture, history, literature, science, business, politics, and economics.

==Publications==

&quot;The Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan&quot; is a journal that contains the full texts of selected papers presented at meetings, as well as other papers submitted for publication. The ASJ also publishes a monthly newsletter known as the &quot;Bulletin&quot;, which contains a detailed summary of the previous month&#x27;s lecture, lecturers&#x27; profiles, announcements of coming events, and news about the ASJ and its members.

For most of the ASJ&#x27;s history, there has been no limit to the range of interests covered. The first ten volumes of the Society&#x27;s Transactions, 1872-1882, printed 146 papers, of which 25 can be roughly classified as geographical or topographical. They are, however, far outnumbered by the largest subject grouping: the scientific papers during the same period, which included 52 studies. But to take the figures further, during the second decade, 1882-1892, 107 papers were printed, of which 4 were geographical and 18 scientific, a reflection of the end of the &#x27;exploration&#x27; phase of Meiji. The men who contributed to the ASJ during its first 20 years began to move on to other activities.

On the 110th anniversary of the ASJ, after having completed his historical account of the first one hundred years of the ASJ, President Douglas Moore Kenrick remarked:

<doc id="624291" wikidata="Q828552" url="?curid=624291" title="Bertrand paradox (probability)">
<text>The Bertrand paradox is a problem within the classical interpretation of probability theory. Joseph Bertrand introduced it in his work &quot;Calcul des probabilités&quot; (1889) as an example to show that the principle of indifference may not produce definite, well-defined results for probabilities if it is applied uncritically when the domain of possibilities is infinite.

==Bertrand&#x27;s formulation of the problem==
The Bertrand paradox is generally presented as follows: Consider an equilateral triangle that is inscribed in a circle. Suppose a chord of the circle is chosen at random. What is the probability that the chord is longer than a side of the triangle?

Bertrand gave three arguments (each using the principle of indifference), all apparently valid yet yielding different results:

# The &quot;random endpoints&quot; method: Choose two random points on the circumference of the circle and draw the chord joining them. To calculate the probability in question imagine the triangle rotated so its vertex coincides with one of the chord endpoints. Observe that if the other chord endpoint lies on the arc between the endpoints of the triangle side opposite the first point, the chord is longer than a side of the triangle. The length of the arc is one third of the circumference of the circle, therefore the probability that a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is .
# The &quot;random radial point&quot; method: Choose a radius of the circle, choose a point on the radius and construct the chord through this point and perpendicular to the radius. To calculate the probability in question imagine the triangle rotated so a side is perpendicular to the radius. The chord is longer than a side of the triangle if the chosen point is nearer the center of the circle than the point where the side of the triangle intersects the radius. The side of the triangle bisects the radius, therefore the probability a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is .
# The &quot;random midpoint&quot; method: Choose a point anywhere within the circle and construct a chord with the chosen point as its midpoint. The chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle if the chosen point falls within a concentric circle of radius the radius of the larger circle. The area of the smaller circle is one fourth the area of the larger circle, therefore the probability a random chord is longer than a side of the inscribed triangle is . 

These three selection methods differ as to the weight they give to chords which are diameters. This issue can be avoided by &quot;regularizing&quot; the problem so as to exclude diameters, without affecting the resulting probabilities. But as presented above, in method 1, each chord can be chosen in exactly one way, regardless of whether or not it is a diameter; in method 2, each diameter can be chosen in two ways, whereas each other chord can be chosen in only one way; and in method 3, each choice of midpoint corresponds to a single chord, except the center of the circle, which is the midpoint of all the diameters.

Other selection methods have been found. In fact, there exists an infinite family of them.

==Classical solution==
The problem&#x27;s classical solution (presented, for example, in Bertrand&#x27;s own work) depends on the method by which a chord is chosen &quot;at random&quot;. The argument is that if the method of random selection is specified, the problem will have a well-defined solution (determined by the principle of indifference). The three solutions presented by Bertrand correspond to different selection methods, and in the absence of further information there is no reason to prefer one over another; accordingly, the problem as stated has no unique solution.

==Jaynes&#x27;s solution using the &quot;maximum ignorance&quot; principle==
In his 1973 paper &quot;The Well-Posed Problem&quot;, Edwin Jaynes proposed a solution to Bertrand&#x27;s paradox based on the principle of &quot;maximum ignorance&quot;—that we should not use any information that is not given in the statement of the problem. Jaynes pointed out that Bertrand&#x27;s problem does not specify the position or size of the circle and argued that therefore any definite and objective solution must be &quot;indifferent&quot; to size and position. In other words: the solution must be both scale and translation invariant.

To illustrate: assume that chords are laid at random onto a circle with a diameter of 2, say by throwing straws onto it from far away and converting them to chords by extension/restriction. Now another circle with a smaller diameter (e.g., 1.1) is laid into the larger circle. Then the distribution of the chords on that smaller circle needs to be the same as the restricted distribution of chords on the larger circle (again using extension/restriction of the generating straws). Thus, if the smaller circle is moved around within the larger circle, the restricted distribution should not change. It can be seen very easily that there would be a change for method 3: the chord distribution on the small red circle looks qualitatively different from the distribution on the large circle:

The same occurs for method 1, though it is harder to see in a graphical representation. Method 2 is the only one that is both scale invariant and translation invariant; method 3 is just scale invariant, method 1 is neither.

However, Jaynes did not just use invariances to accept or reject given methods: this would leave the possibility that there is another not yet described method that would meet his common-sense criteria. Jaynes used the integral equations describing the invariances to directly determine the probability distribution. In this problem, the integral equations indeed have a unique solution, and it is precisely what was called &quot;method 2&quot; above, the &quot;random radius&quot; method.

In a 2015 article, Alon Drory argued that Jaynes&#x27; principle can also yield Bertrand&#x27;s other two solutions. Drory argues that the mathematical implementation of the above invariance properties is not unique, but depends on the underlying procedure of random selection that one uses (as mentioned above, Jaynes used a straw-throwing method to choose random chords). He shows that each of Bertrand&#x27;s three solutions can be derived using rotational, scaling, and translational invariance, concluding that Jaynes&#x27; principle is just as subject to interpretation as the principle of indifference itself.

For example, we may consider throwing a dart at the circle, and drawing the chord having the chosen point as its center. Then the unique distribution which is translation, rotation, and scale invariant is the one called &quot;method 3&quot; above.

Likewise, &quot;method 1&quot; is the unique invariant distribution for a scenario where a spinner is used to select one endpoint of the chord, and then used again to select the orientation of the chord. Here the invariance in question consists of rotational invariance for each of the two spins. It is also the unique scale and rotation invariant distribution for a scenario where a rod is placed vertically over a point on the circle&#x27;s circumference, and allowed to drop to the horizontal position (conditional on it landing partly inside the circle).

==Physical experiments==
&quot;Method 2&quot; is the only solution that fulfills the transformation invariants that are present in certain physical systems—such as in statistical mechanics and gas physics—in the specific case of Jaynes&#x27;s proposed experiment of throwing straws from a distance onto a small circle. Nevertheless, one can design other practical experiments that give answers according to the other methods. For example, in order to arrive at the solution of &quot;method 1&quot;, the &quot;random endpoints&quot; method, one can affix a spinner to the center of the circle, and let the results of two independent spins mark the endpoints of the chord. In order to arrive at the solution of &quot;method 3&quot;, one could cover the circle with molasses and mark the first point that a fly lands on as the midpoint of the chord. Several observers have designed experiments in order to obtain the different solutions and verified the results empirically.

<text>Samuel Hirsch, (June 8, 1815 – May 14, 1889) was a major Reform Judaism philosopher and rabbi who mainly worked and resided in present-day Germany in his earlier years. He promoted the radical German Reform Judaism movement and published several works in the 1840s. He moved to the United States in 1866 where he would die in Chicago, Illinois in 1889.

==Biography==
Born in Thalfang (in modern-day Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany; formerly part of Prussia), he received his training at Metz. He attended the University of Bonn, the University of Berlin, and the University of Leipzig.

He first became rabbi at Dessau in 1838 but was forced to resign in 1841 because he promoted a radically liberal form of Judaism, later to become known as classic German Reform Judaism. In 1843 he published his &quot;Die Messias-Lehre der Juden in Kanzelvorträgen&quot; and &quot;Religionsphilosophie der Juden.&quot;

In 1843 he was appointed chief rabbi of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by King William II of the Netherlands. During this period he published his &quot;Die Humanität als Religion.&quot; He took an active part in the annual rabbinical conferences held at Brunswick (1844), Frankfurt am Main (1845), and Breslau (1846). In 1844 he published his &quot;Reform im Judenthum.&quot;

Having received a call from the Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1866, he resigned his post in Europe and moved to the United States. There he succeeded Dr. David Einhorn. From his arrival onward he became closely identified with, and an open advocate of the radical reform movement. In 1869 he was elected president of the rabbinical conference held in Philadelphia, at which the principles of Reform Judaism were formulated. In that year he engaged also in numerous ritual and doctrinal controversies.

Hirsch remained officiating rabbi of the Philadelphia congregation for 22 years, resigning in 1888, after having spent 50 years of his life in the ministry. Moving to Chicago, he took up his abode there with his son, philosopher and rabbi Prof. Emil G. Hirsch. During his rabbinate in Philadelphia Hirsch organized the Orphans&#x27; Guardian Society, and was the founder of the first branch in the United States of the Alliance Israélite Universelle.

Hirsch is best known as the author of the &quot;Religionsphilosophie,&quot; a work written from the Hegelian point of view, but for the purpose of vindicating the claim of Judaism to the rank denied it by Hegel, the rank of an &quot;absolute religion.&quot; In this book he proved himself to be an original thinker (see &quot;Allg. Zeit. des Jud.&quot; 1895, pp. 126 et seq.). His &quot;Katechismus der Israelitischen Religion&quot; was also constructed on original lines; he considered the Biblical legends to be psychological and typical allegories, and the ceremonies of Judaism to be symbols of underlying ideas. From this attitude his Reform principles are derived. He denied that Judaism is a law; it is &quot;Lehre&quot; (&quot;teaching&quot; or &quot;lore&quot;) but is expressed in symbolic ceremonies that may be changed in accordance with historic development.

He was the first to propose holding Jewish services on Sunday instead of the traditional Jewish Sabbath &quot;Shabbat&quot;.

He contributed to the early volumes of &quot;The Jewish Times&quot; (1869–1878). His principal works were first issued in Germany, among them &quot;What is Judaism?&quot; (1838), a collection of sermons (1841), and &quot;Religious Philosophy of the Jews&quot; (1843). He published nothing in book form after coming to the United States.

<text>Blossom is an American sitcom that aired for five seasons on NBC. Debuting as a pilot preview on July 5, 1990, it premiered as a mid-season replacement on January 3, 1991, and aired until May 22, 1995. Don Reo created the series, which starred Mayim Bialik as Blossom Russo, a teenager who lived with her father and two elder brothers. It was produced by Reo&#x27;s Impact Zone Productions and Witt/Thomas Productions in association with Touchstone Television.

==Premise==
Blossom Russo, an Italian-American teenager, lives with her single father Nick in a male-dominated household that includes elder brothers Tony and Joey. In the beginning of the series, it is revealed Blossom&#x27;s family is adjusting in the wake of their mother Maddy leaving to pursue her own life and career. Nick is a session musician who is frequently between gigs and tours, Tony is a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who eventually goes on to become a paramedic, and middle sibling Joey is a stereotypical &quot;dumb jock&quot; known for the exaggerated delivery of his catchphrase, &quot;Whoa!&quot;

Blossom&#x27;s best friend Six LeMeure also plays a significant part in her life. Six, an especially fast talker, is known for her tendency to ramble. Blossom would frequently have fantasy sequences wherein she would receive advice from celebrities such as Mr. T, Phylicia Rashad, David Spade, ALF, Will Smith, and God (played by Don Novello).

== Production ==

===Development===
In 1988, series creator Don Reo had begun a producing partnership with Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas, in which the latter two were bringing his screenplays to television under the established Witt/Thomas Productions nameplate. Reo conceived of the idea that would become the genesis for &quot;Blossom&quot; when he attended a family party thrown by his longtime friend Dion DiMucci, lead singer of Dion and the Belmonts. At the party, DiMucci demonstrated a &quot;hip, with-it musician father&quot; family dynamic with his children, inspiring Reo to develop a pilot in which the &quot;cool&quot; father would be a highlight.

Reo was also inspired by J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; and wanted to create a series about a wise-beyond-his-years, introspective teenage boy modeled closely after protagonist Holden Caulfield. Reo decided to include both the hip father and Holden Caulfield-esque boy in the pilot, with the boy as the lead character. He first pitched the project to NBC in 1989 under the title &quot;Richie&quot;. NBC liked the screenplay, but network executive Leslie Lurie suggested that producers change the lead character to a girl &quot;because of the overabundance of coming-of-age stories with boys.&quot; In the series finale episode, Reo and producer Judith D. Allison included a reference to the inspiration for Blossom&#x27;s character when Blossom describes herself as a &quot;teenage Holden Caulfield.&quot;

=== Casting ===
At the time Mayim Bialik filmed the pilot episode, she had recently worked on another sitcom project for Fox, entitled &quot;Molloy&quot;. The pilot episode of &quot;Blossom&quot; was taped in the spring of 1990 and was the first of the projects to air, with NBC broadcasting the pilot as a special on July 5, 1990. Four weeks later, Fox commenced a seven-episode tryout run for &quot;Molloy&quot;, whose episodes had been filmed earlier in 1989. &quot;Molloy&quot; was canceled for its low ratings, freeing Bialik to commit to &quot;Blossom&quot; whose ratings for the pilot special pleased NBC executives.

Natasha Lyonne vied for the role of Six, but the role eventually went to Jenna von Oÿ.

Bialik suggested Michael Stoyanov for the role of her brother after seeing him guest star on sister series &quot;Empty Nest&quot;. Bialik thought she and Stoyanov shared a strong physical resemblance and would be believable as brother and sister.

NBC ordered &quot;Blossom&quot; as a mid-season replacement for January 1991.

=== Pilot episode ===
NBC executives thought the depiction of an emotionally intuitive child paired alongside a super-chic father was too radical for its time; thus, Blossom has a more nuclear, conservative family dynamic in the pilot episode. Her father was named Ted Russo and was played by Richard Masur, while her mother Barbara Russo was played by Barrie Youngfellow. In the plot of the pilot, Blossom&#x27;s parents are married but she suspected their marriage was in trouble.

The characters of Tony and Joey were also present in the pilot and played by the same actors from the regular series; however, Joey Lawrence&#x27;s character was then named Donny. Neither of Blossom&#x27;s parents had musical careers and instead worked in finance. Tony was going through his first drug/alcohol rehab period (in which Terry remarked that &quot;he had a serious problem--he missed all of 1989&quot;) and had his own separate scene with Blossom in the kitchen as he gave her sage anecdotes about their lives.

The airing of the original pilot episode ranked number 3 for the week in the national Nielsen ratings. It was one spot ahead of a repeat of the pilot episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;. About two weeks after the pilot aired, NBC ordered more episodes of &quot;Blossom&quot;.

=== Series run ===
When NBC picked up &quot;Blossom&quot; as a regular series, Reo successfully convinced programming chief Brandon Tartikoff to allow the lead character to have the chic, divorced musician father he had originally envisioned for the project. Masur and Youngfellow&#x27;s roles were recast, and Ted Wass, who had previously starred in Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas&#x27; 1970s sitcom &quot;Soap&quot;, was cast as Blossom&#x27;s single dad Nick Russo. Witt and Thomas persuaded Wass, who was then considering leaving acting to become a director, to take the role on the condition he could also direct multiple episodes. Mayim Bialik had also enjoyed auditioning with Wass the most out of the other actors who were trying out for the role.

Five seasons of &quot;Blossom&quot; were produced, with a total of 114 episodes.

Bill Bixby became a frequent director on the series in its third season, a role he continued in for several episodes into the fourth, despite his ongoing battle with prostate cancer. On November 15, 1993, shortly after learning that his illness was terminal, Bixby collapsed on the &quot;Blossom&quot; set and was hospitalized. He died six days later.

=== Opening sequences ===
In the pilot episode, the song in the opening credits is Bobby Brown&#x27;s 1988 hit single &quot;My Prerogative&quot;, which plays as Blossom dances in her bedroom on home video. When the show went to series, the song “My Opinionation” performed by Dr. John was used as a replacement theme. The title sequence was re-shot so that Bialik&#x27;s dancing was more in sync with the newer song.

The opening sequence for season two was changed to clips of dance moves by the title character on film and in front of a pastel blue/pink background. Blossom&#x27;s outfit changed in each dancing scene and her dance moves ranged from belly dancing to voguing. Barnard Hughes was added to the main cast and opening credits under the &quot;With&quot; heading, preceding Ted Wass.

In the third season, the dancing concept was expanded upon and main cast members Lawrence, Stoyanov, von Oÿ and Wass joined Bialik one at a time as she danced. Portia Dawson and David Lascher&#x27;s names were included, despite the actors not being physically present in the sequence. This version of the intro lasted through the end of season four. Also beginning in season three, many scenes of the show opened and closed with the first frame frozen in a multi-colored watercolor effect. The watercolor stills lasted through the end of the series.

The fifth and final season dropped a full-fledged intro, instead simply displaying the &quot;Blossom&quot; show logo over the watercolor effect to the opening notes of &quot;My Opinionation&quot;. During the 1994–1995 season, NBC began running its credits in the squeeze-screen format; thus, cast and crew&#x27;s credits were positioned at the beginning of each episode.

== Crossovers ==
Because &quot;Blossom&quot; aired immediately after &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; on NBC for a period, NBC cross-promoted the shows on two occasions. Will Smith appeared in the season 2 episode &quot;I&#x27;m with the Band&quot; as himself under his rap stage name The Fresh Prince, and later that season Karyn Parsons made an appearance on the show in &quot;Wake Up Little Suzy&quot; as her &quot;Fresh Prince&quot; character Hilary Banks. Estelle Getty appeared in one episode in season 1 as Sophia Petrillo, her character from &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; and &quot;Empty Nest&quot;.

==Episodes==

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
Though &quot;Blossom&quot; provided impressive ratings for NBC, early critical reviews were mixed. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt the premise of the show was overdone, saying it is &quot;yet another show about a nice, hapless single father (in this case, Ted Wass) coping with kids.&quot; Tucker praised Mayim Bialik and said the show is &quot;raised to a higher level by [her] uncommon charm,&quot; but called the other characters bland, saying, &quot;the male characters could exchange each other&#x27;s lines and you wouldn’t notice — they&#x27;re all the same generic nice-guy wiseacre.&quot;

Critic David Zurawik was amongst the few who praised the show and surmised that the lack of attention from other critics was due to many of them being &quot;older, white men&quot; who were more attuned to boys&#x27; coming-of-age stories. Zurawik opined that the dearth of female representation and female-driven stories on TV made &quot;Blossom&quot; an important show, and that by centering on a teenage girl, &quot;Blossom&quot; &quot;is also telling adolescent girls that their concerns and feelings are as important as the concerns and feelings of adolescent boys.&quot; Zurawik added that in &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, another popular show for teens, &quot;the boys are the main characters, and the girls come up and either create the problem or tag along. The boys talk the most . . . and they are the ones who come up with the solutions.&quot; However, in &quot;Blossom&quot;, the female character is at the center and her &quot;problems and concerns are what count. She finds her own solutions. Which is what makes &quot;Blossom&quot; such a rare show and an interesting case study of network television and our attitudes about what makes for a good TV show.&quot;

Zurawik also lauded the show for its humor and its inclusion of more serious issues, writing,&quot;&quot;Blossom&quot; does regularly deal with serious topics: Blossom&#x27;s first period, using condoms, Blossom possibly running away...But some of the plots are as simple as Blossom and Six camping out overnight to get tickets to a C+C Music Factory concert, then meeting the group members and getting to dance with them — a nice half-hour of teen fantasy that ends on some high-energy, feel-good dancing. And let&#x27;s not forget those &#x27;fave&#x27; outfits Blossom creates or Blossom&#x27;s own thoughts on what the show is all about.&quot;By 1994, &quot;Variety&quot; said &quot;Blossom&quot; was &quot;one of the more sharply written sitcoms of the past five years.&quot;

=== Awards ===
In 1993, Blossom received an Emmy Award nomination for Ouststanding Individual Achievement in Lighting Direction for a comedy series, and was nominated for a Humanitas Prize for the episode &quot;The Date&quot;, written and directed by season 5 executive producer Allan Katz. Bialik, Lawrence, and von Oÿ were all nominated for multiple Young Star Awards, with both Lawrence and von Oÿ winning in 1993 for Outstanding Young Comedian in a Television Series and Best Young Actress Co-starring in a Television Series, respectively.

=== Syndication ===
The show was unsuccessful when it was first syndicated, running only from September 1995 to September 1999 in local syndication. Reruns also previously ran on cable&#x27;s WGN and Hub Network / Discovery Family.

== Cultural impact ==
&quot;Blossom&quot; was heralded for being one of the rare primetime TV shows at the time to center on a teenage girl, the other show being &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot; on Nickelodeon. It also received praise for addressing topics like family dysfunction, addiction, sex, single fatherhood, and depression. &quot;Blossom&quot; was the first family sitcom to feature a teenage character dealing with substance abuse recovery. In later seasons, the show increasingly tackled more mature issues, such as the dangers of sexual assault and gun violence.

In a retrospective article for &quot;Slate&quot;, Willa Paskin wrote that &quot;&quot;Blossom,&quot; like any sitcom with teenagers, features lots of lessons learned, but most of those lessons skirt a cheesy &quot;Full House&quot; fate because they aren’t overly simplistic,&quot; and that today, &quot;it&#x27;s still rare for sitcoms, even the good ones, to embrace ambiguity.&quot;

Mayim Bialik said in 2016, &quot;What we tried to show was the full range of emotions that human beings can have, but in particular that young women can have. The images of women that most of us raised in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s, and even the &#x27;60s, saw of women wasn&#x27;t always appropriately complicated. A lot of times it was the bimbo or the nerd, you were either pretty or you were ugly and that&#x27;s sort of how characters were written. With &quot;Blossom&quot; we were trying to show someone who had ups and downs. Some days she felt good, some days she didn&#x27;t. We did a great episode called &quot;Blue Blossom&quot;, which was about her being depressed and those were things we were trying to normalize.&quot;

Bialik added, &quot;The character did not look like a runway model. She wore normal clothes. Some days we had flannel shirts and jeans days. And the actress playing her, me, was not a traditionally attractive female that people were used to seeing on TV, especially for lead women. The fact that it is so commonplace now… I don&#x27;t know that we&#x27;re uniquely responsible for that, but we definitely were the first network show I knew about at that time that was about a girl.&quot;

The outfits worn by Blossom and Six turned the characters into trend setters, popularizing flowered, floppy hats, baby-doll dresses, and sundresses. Costume designer Sherry Thompson and costume supervisor Marion Kirk culled the characters&#x27; eclectic wardrobes, which would average six outfits per episode, from Melrose Avenue boutiques and chain stores. In 1993, an official &quot;Blossom&quot; clothing line was released in department stores.

During the series&#x27; run and after, it was parodied or referenced in other shows like &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Friends&quot;. The show was also referenced in a 2010 episode of &quot;Glee&quot; and on sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, the latter which Bialik joined as a main cast member. In January 2022, the season 2 premiere of &quot;Call Me Kat&quot;, a Fox sitcom starring Bialik, featured a reunion of original &quot;Blossom&quot; actors von Oÿ, Lawrence, and Stoyanov. The trio portrayed themselves as actors from the sitcom, but did not refer to the titular character Blossom and only referenced the iconic hats and opening credit dance numbers.

On the January 14, 2025 episode of Night Court, lead character Judge Abby Stone, who is played by Miyam Bialik&#x27;s former &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; co-star Melissa Rauch, boasts how she is an avid Blossom fan, even keeping the Blossom theme song on her cell phone as her &quot;wedding precession,&quot; dancing to the Blossom theme song with Bialik and even preferring the character to Bialik&#x27;s other known roles such as those in Call Me Kat and The Big Bang Theory; Stone even notes how she did not know about Bialik&#x27;s &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; role. When first performing the Blossom dance with Stone, Bialik claims that Stone was the first person she can recall in recent time who asked her to do &quot;Blossom&quot; dance with.

==Home media==
On January 27, 2009, Shout! Factory (under license from rights-holders ABC and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment) released Seasons 1 &amp; 2 of &quot;Blossom&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 6-disc boxset includes all-new interviews with cast members, the original pilot episode, featurettes and audio commentaries.

Mill Creek Entertainment released a 10 episode best-of set entitled &quot;Blossom - 10 Very Special Episodes&quot; on October 12, 2010. The single disc release features episodes from the first 2 seasons.
For a period of time all five seasons of &quot;Blossom&quot; were available to stream on Hulu. In January 2019, the series was removed from the streaming service.

== Possible reboot ==
In May 2023, Bialik announced that a reunion series was in the works. The script for the pilot was complete and the entire cast was on board. On October 3, 2023, Bialik hinted that the reboot might not return as a sitcom.

Bialik told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, “We’re hoping to reboot it not as a sitcom, though…we want to bring back these interesting, deep characters—a child of divorce, a recovering drug addict, an alcoholic—to see them in a whole new way.”

<text>Elliott Gould (; né Goldstein; born August 29, 1938) is an American actor.

Gould&#x27;s breakthrough role was in the film &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; (1969), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The following year, he starred as Capt. Trapper John McIntyre in the Robert Altman film &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), for which he received BAFTA Award and Golden Globe Award nominations. Gould continued working with Altman in &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973) and &quot;California Split&quot; (1974). Other notable film roles include Alan Arkin&#x27;s &quot;Little Murders&quot; (1971), Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Touch&quot; (1971), Richard Attenborough&#x27;s &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978), &quot;The Silent Partner&quot; (1978), &quot;Over the Brooklyn Bridge&quot; (1984), Barry Levinson&#x27;s &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), &quot;American History X&quot; (1998), Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Contagion&quot; (2011), and &quot;Ruby Sparks&quot; (2012). He also starred as Reuben Tishkoff in the &quot;Ocean&#x27;s&quot; film series (2001, 2004, 2007, and 2018).

Gould is also known for his work in television. He is a member of &quot;SNL&quot;″s Five Timers&#x27; Club, having hosted six times from 1976 to 1980. He is also known for his recurring role as Jack Geller on the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; (1994–2004), his recurring roles in the Fox sitcom &quot;Mulaney&quot; (2014–2015), and the Showtime series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; (2013–2016). Additionally, he has appeared on the Netflix shows &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot;, &quot;Lincoln Lawyer&quot;, and &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot;.

== Birth and early life ==
Gould was born in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, New York City. His mother, Lucille (née Raver), sold artificial flowers to beauty shops, and his father, Bernard Goldstein, worked in the garment business as a textiles buyer. His family is Jewish, with his grandparents migrating from Ukraine, Poland, and Russia. He was graduated from the Professional Children&#x27;s School.

== Career ==
===Early roles===
Gould began acting on Broadway in the late 1950s, making his professional debut in a minor role in the musical &quot;Rumple&quot; (1957). The musical starred Eddie Foy Jr., Gretchen Wyler, and Stephen Douglass with music and lyrics by Ernest G. Schweikert and Frank Reardon. He followed this with small parts in successful productions such as the Betty Comden and Adolph Green musical &quot;Say, Darling&quot; (1958–59) featuring Robert Morse, David Wayne, and Vivian Blaine. He also appeared in the French musical &quot;Irma La Douce&quot; (1960–61) with Elizabeth Seal and Clive Revill.

=== 1960s ===
In 1962, he had a starring role in the Broadway production of &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale,&quot; which ran for 300 performances and where he met future wife Barbra Streisand. Following that, he landed prominent roles in &quot;Drat! The Cat!&quot; (1965) and in &quot;Little Murders&quot; (1971). He was also cast in &quot;A Way of Life&quot; by Murray Schisgal but walked out before the play made it to Broadway.

Gould made his feature film debut in the William Dieterle comedy &quot;Quick, Let&#x27;s Get Married&quot; (1964) starring Ginger Rogers, Ray Milland, and Barbara Eden. The film was an attempt to revitalize Rogers&#x27; career, but did not get a full release until 1971. In the film Gould plays a mute character. He received star billing for his performance. Gould&#x27;s next film appearance was in William Friedkin&#x27;s musical comedy film &quot;The Night They Raided Minsky&#x27;s&quot; (1968) produced by Norman Lear. The film gives a fictional account of the invention of the striptease at Minsky&#x27;s Burlesque in 1925. The film also starred Jason Robards, Denholm Elliott, and Jack Burns.

In January 1969, Gould announced he had formed his own film production company with Jack Brodsky, Brodsky-Gould Productions. The company would make two films: &quot;The Assistant&quot;, based on a novel by Bernard Malamud, and &quot;Little Murders.&quot; (&quot;The Assistant&quot; was never produced.) In April 1970, Brodsky and Gould announced plans to make &quot;The Dick&quot;, from the novel by Bruce Jay Friedman, but it was never made. That same year, Gould reached a new level of prominence playing one of the four leads in Paul Mazursky&#x27;s zeitgeisty social comedy &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; starring alongside Natalie Wood, Robert Culp, and Dyan Cannon. Gould played Ted Henderson. The film was released in September 1969. The film was a critical and financial success. In Roger Ebert&#x27;s review in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, he wrote that &quot;Gould emerges, not so much a star, more of a &quot;personality,&quot; like Severn Darden or Estelle Parsons. He&#x27;s very funny.&quot; For his performance, Gould earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor losing to Gig Young for &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m the hottest thing in Hollywood right now,&quot; he said in October 1969.

=== 1970s ===
In March 1969, Gould signed a non-exclusive, four-picture contract with 20th Century Fox, the first of which was to be Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and the second &quot;Move&quot; both released in 1970. His first film released after &quot;Bob &amp; Carol&quot; was the wartime satire &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), directed by Robert Altman, where Gould played Trapper John McIntyre. It was a huge hit at the box office and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; film critic John Mahoney wrote in his review &quot;If Elliott Gould keeps selecting and performing in films the way he has thus far, people may start going to pictures just because he is in them.&quot; With significant successes of &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, Gould appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine that year, where he was described as a &quot;star for an uptight age&quot;.

Gould&#x27;s other films of 1970 included the Richard Rush directed comedy-drama film &quot;Getting Straight&quot;, where he played a Vietnam veteran who gets involved in student protests. Candice Bergen also stars as his girlfriend. The film was not as popular as the other two movies, but it was nonetheless still considered a success – the only student protest film to make money – and cemented Gould&#x27;s place as one of the biggest film stars in the country. Also released that year was &quot;Move&quot; (1970), co-starring Paula Prentiss, which was his first critical and commercial flop. Also unsuccessful was &quot;I Love My Wife&quot; (1970), with Brenda Vaccaro, for which Gould had turned down a reunion with Altman on &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971). He had also turned down the lead in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971).

Gould&#x27;s next efforts would turn mixed results, including his decision to buy the rights for &quot;Little Murders&quot; with an eye to producing and reprising his lead role in a film adaptation. Directed by Alan Arkin, and released in 1971, it was another commercial disappointment, but has since earned a cult following. Gould went to Sweden to play the lead role in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s English-language debut &quot;The Touch&quot; (1971). He was the first Hollywood star to appear in a Bergman film. &quot;The Touch&quot; received mixed reviews and was not one of Bergman&#x27;s more successful films commercially.

Gould and his producing partner helped make Woody Allen&#x27;s satirical slapstick comedy &quot;Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)&quot; (1972), later selling it to United Artists. He was reportedly offered the lead role in &quot;Pocket Money&quot; (1972), but turned it down because he did not want to work with director Stuart Rosenberg again after his experience making &quot;Move&quot;. Gould continued developing projects in a behind-the-scenes capacity, including a failed adaptation of the novel &quot;A Glimpse of Tiger&quot;. Filming was abandoned after four days of shooting, following rumours that Gould was addicted to drugs, something the actor has strenuously denied.

In 1972, he was among the guests in David Winters&#x27; musical television special &quot;The Special London Bridge Special&quot;, starring Tom Jones, and Jennifer O&#x27;Neill.

Gould reemerged with one of his most iconic roles in 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, Robert Altman&#x27;s adaptation of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s novel. Gould starred as detective Philip Marlowe, a role which had previously been played by Humphrey Bogart and Dick Powell. By comparison, Gould&#x27;s performance was more naturalistic, with the screenplay by Leigh Brackett (who had previously adapted &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; for Howard Hawks and Bogart) updating the setting to contemporary Los Angeles. Although not a major hit, the film was later regarded as one of Gould&#x27;s best. Alan R. Howard of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote &quot;The eccentric casting of Elliott Gould is altogether successful and allows the filmmakers to embrace the detective genre affectionately, transforming it into a dreamlike excursion through modern Los Angeles.&quot;

The following year, Gould reunited with Robert Altman for the film, &quot;California Split&quot; (1974), an acclaimed gambling dramedy that co-starred George Segal. Additionally, Gould made a brief cameo appearance as himself in the Altman film &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975).

He soon made two more &quot;buddy&quot; movies: &quot;Busting&quot; (1974), a cop movie with Robert Blake, directed by Peter Hyams; and &quot;S*P*Y*S&quot; (1975), a spy spoof which reunited him with Sutherland. Neither was particularly popular. Returning to comedy, he played the lead in two films for Brut Productions, both comedies: &quot;Whiffs&quot; (1975) and then opposite Diane Keaton in &quot;I Will, I Will... for Now&quot; (1976). He and Keaton also starred in &quot;Harry and Walter Go to New York&quot; (1976) with James Caan and Michael Caine. All flopped at the box office. He joined the ensemble cast of Richard Attenborough&#x27;s World War II drama film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977). Gould played Col. Robert Stout, a role based on Robert Sink. The ensemble cast included Robert Redford, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Liv Ullmann, and Laurence Olivier. The film was a financial and critical success.

The following year Gould returned to mainstream success with &quot;Capricorn One&quot; (1978), directed by Peter Hyams and starring James Brolin, Sam Waterston, and O. J. Simpson. The film was financed by producer Lew Grade, who later arranged Gould&#x27;s guest appearances in &quot;The Muppets&quot; and its movie spin-offs. After making &quot;Capricorn One&quot; Gould was announced to direct &quot;A New Life&quot; from a novel by Bernard Malamud with Robert Altman producing but the film was not made. Gould went to Canada to star in the highly regarded thriller &quot;The Silent Partner&quot; (1978) starring Christopher Plummer before working again with Grade on &quot;Escape to Athena&quot; (1979). He starred in the much-maligned remake of &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1979). Also in 1979, Gould appeared as Cher&#x27;s dance partner at the end of the music video for her Top 10 disco hit &quot;Take Me Home&quot;.

During this period Gould hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; six times, his final time being the first episode of the disastrous Jean Doumanian season (season 6) in November 1980, where he was shocked to find that the original cast and producer Lorne Michaels were gone and had been replaced. Although he never hosted SNL again, he did appear in a season 16 (1990–1991) episode hosted by Tom Hanks where Hanks is welcomed into the Five-Timers club, a society for celebrities who have hosted the show five times. He returned in season 47 (2021–2022) in a similar skit welcoming John Mulaney into the club.

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Gould starred in the romantic comedy film &quot;Falling in Love Again&quot; (1980), alongside Susannah York. Gould also made two films for Disney, &quot;The Last Flight of Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Devil and Max Devlin&quot; (1981). Gould chose to return to Broadway with &quot;The Guys in the Truck&quot; in 1983 but left the production after the first week of previews, replaced by Harris Laskawy. The play closed on opening night.

Gould transitioned to television acting. From 1984 to 1985 Gould appeared on the CBS medical sitcom &quot;E/R&quot; playing the role of Dr. Howard Sheinfeld for 23 episodes. He appeared in 1986 &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode: &quot;The Misfortune Cookie&quot;. He also starred in the HBO television film &quot;&quot; (1987) playing criminal defense lawyer Leonard Weinglass. The film was directed and written by Jeremy Kagan and starred Carl Lumbly, Peter Boyle, Robert Loggia, Martin Sheen, and Billy Zane. He also continued acting in guest star roles on shows such as &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;. He continued to act in film, though his roles tended to be less impactful than those from preceding decades: he had leading roles in films such as &quot;Inside Out&quot; (1986) and &quot;Dangerous Love&quot; (1988) and he played a supporting role to Whoopi Goldberg in &quot;The Telephone&quot; (1988).

=== 1990s ===
Over time, Gould began to act more frequently in supporting roles. He received critical praise for his performance as an aging mobster in Warren Beatty&#x27;s 1991 film &quot;Bugsy&quot; and once again performed a cameo as &quot;himself&quot; in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot; (1992).

During the 1990s, Gould continued starring in guest roles in shows such as &quot;L.A. Law&quot;, &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot;, &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He co-starred with Michael McKean in Billy Crystal&#x27;s 1991 six-part HBO comedy miniseries &quot;Sessions&quot;. He also became known to a new generation of viewers thanks to a recurring role as Jack Geller, the father of Courtney Cox&#x27;s and David Schwimmer&#x27;s characters Monica and Ross, on the NBC sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;, first appearing in 1994 and in twenty total episodes over the course of the show&#x27;s run. 

Around the same time he took a more dramatic role, as the boyfriend of the protagonist&#x27;s mother, in the controversial drama &quot;American History X&quot; (1998) starring Edward Norton. While first reading the script, he believed the movie was a comedy similar to &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;, until he read the part where Norton&#x27;s character curb stomps a black man.

=== 2000s ===

In 2001, Gould co-starred in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;, a 2001 remake of the classic Rat Pack caper film. The film starred George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, and Carl Reiner. The film earned positive reviews and was an immense financial success. Gould played their wealthy friend, a former casino owner Reuben Tishkoff. He reprised the role for its sequels, &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; in 2004 and &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Thirteen&quot; in 2007.

In 2005 he guest starred in a feature-length episode of the UK TV series &quot;Poirot&quot;, subsequently appearing in similar one-off or small roles in television series including &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;&quot;, and a more significant role in Showtime&#x27;s &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; from 2013 to 2016. He has loaned his voice to several animated series, including the role of Mr. Stoppable, Ron Stoppable&#x27;s dad in the Disney Channel Animated series &quot;Kim Possible&quot; (2003–2007). He also lent his voice for &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;American Dad&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In 2011, Gould appeared in a supporting role in Soderbergh&#x27;s ensemble thriller &quot;Contagion&quot; (2011) about virus outbreak leading to a worldwide pandemic. The cast included Matt Damon, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, Marion Cotillard, Laurence Fishburne, and Jennifer Ehle. The film received critical acclaim and was a box office success. The following year he appeared in Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris&#x27; romantic comedy-drama film &quot;Ruby Sparks&quot; (2012) starring Paul Dano, Zoe Kazan. More recently, he co-starred with Jemaine Clement in the human comedy &quot;Humor Me&quot; (2017). In 2018, Gould reprised his role of Reuben in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 8&quot;. He appeared in 2020&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Lies&quot;.

Gould appeared in guest starring roles in detective shows such as &quot;&quot; (2010) and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2012). He also appeared in a recurring role as Ezra Goldman in the Showtime crime series &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; (2013–2016) starring Liev Schreiber and Jon Voight. Gould also played John Mulaney&#x27;s neighbor in the sitcom &quot;Mulaney&quot; (2014–2015). He also appeared in guest roles in &quot;Maron&quot; (2015), &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot; (2018), and &quot;Grace and Frankie&quot; (2020). He also briefly appeared in &quot;&quot; along with Christina Pickles and the rest of the &quot;Friends&quot; cast.
