<text>Jakub Berman (23 December 1901 – 10 April 1984) was a Polish communist politician. An activist during the Second Polish Republic, in post-war communist Poland he was a member of the Politburo of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) and then of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). From 1948, he was considered the second most powerful politician in Poland after President Bolesław Bierut, until he was removed from power in 1956, following Bierut&#x27;s death.

Alongside Bierut, Berman was responsible for party oversight of the Stalinist Ministry of Public Security, commonly known as the &quot;UB&quot;. Under Berman&#x27;s leadership, 200,000 people were imprisoned for alleged political crimes, and 6000 were executed. Berman also oversaw Poland&#x27;s cultural affairs.

==Early career==

Jakub Berman was born into a middle-class Jewish family in Warsaw on 23 December 1901. His younger brother was Adolf Berman. Jakub became a member of the Communist Youth Union and in 1928 joined the Communist Party of Poland (KPP). He was arrested a few times, but unlike many other activists, had not been imprisoned for a prolonged period. He received a law degree in 1925 from the University of Warsaw. He wrote a magister thesis entitled &quot;Służba domowa w Warszawie w końcu w. XVIII oraz próby jej zrzeszenia się zawodowego&quot; (&#x27;Domestic servantry in Warsaw at the end of the 18th century and its attempts to establish a trade association&#x27;). Berman&#x27;s academic adviser, Marxist sociologist Prof. Ludwik Krzywicki, wanted to hire Berman at the university as his assistant, but this was not allowed because of Berman&#x27;s Jewish origin. Krzywicki&#x27;s efforts to find Berman a mainstream non-university job also failed and Berman ended up working for a Jewish agency, in a poorly paid position. The family was supported largely by Berman&#x27;s wife, Gustawa (&quot;née&quot; Grynberg), who was a well-regarded physician and dentist.

Berman&#x27;s social contacts in Warsaw included many communist sympathizing members of the Polish intelligentsia; Janina and Władysław Broniewski, as well as Wanda Wasilewska, were among his associates. Between 1935–36, he worked with Aleksander Wat (as his tutor on behalf of the KPP) in an attempt to establish a leftist periodical, with the intention of the cooperation of the communists with other leftist forces in Poland (mostly the Polish Socialist Party (PPS)), within the Popular Front.

==World War II==

On 6 September 1939, after the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, Berman followed government directions for &quot;able-bodied men&quot; and took a train going in an easterly direction. He went to Białystok, occupied by the Soviet Union after the Soviet invasion of Poland. With his friend Alfred Lampe, Berman was active in Polish-communist circles there and became a Soviet citizen. In March 1941 he moved to Minsk, where he worked as an editor at &quot;Sztandar Wolności&quot; (&#x27;The Banner of Freedom&#x27;), a Polish-language bulletin published by the Communist Party of Byelorussia. Berman&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, written under the direction of Krzywicki and entitled &quot;O strukturze miast polskich na podstawie spisu ludności w 1791 r.&quot; (&#x27;On the structure of Polish cities based on the population census of 1791&#x27;), was brought to Białystok by his friend and colleague Irena Sawicka, but burned in Minsk when a dormitory where Berman and other journalists were housed was bombed by the Germans.

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Berman escaped to Moscow. He later became an instructor at the International Lenin School, the Comintern school, where he trained displaced Polish communists, activists for the new Soviet-sponsored Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR). With the help from Georgi Dimitrov and Jerzy Borejsza, Berman was able to bring his wife and daughter Lucyna there too.

In December 1943, Berman met Joseph Stalin at a Kremlin reception for activists of the Union of Polish Patriots (ZPP). Berman became a prominent figure among the Polish communists in the Soviet Union (according to Berman, however, Stalin hated him).

In 1945, after a survey suggested that 4.8 million Polish citizens including 3 million Jews had died in the war, Berman stated &quot;if we accept that 3 million Jews were murdered, we must significantly increase the number of Polish victims&quot;. He declared that 3 million non-Jewish Poles had died, in order to equalize the numbers, to make them acceptable to Polish public opinion. According to Jan Grabowski, this policy of &quot;equalizing&quot; the respective numbers of Jewish and Polish victims has since been propagated in Poland and that is how the issue is presently taught to students in public schools.

==Political career in communist-ruled Poland==

In the summer of 1944, Berman joined the Politburo of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) and returned to Poland. In Lublin, at the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), Berman practically led the foreign affairs department; which was primarily concerned with securing international recognition for the new communist-led governing entity.

In January 1945, with the liberation of Warsaw from the Nazis by the Red Army, the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (formerly the PKWN) moved from Lublin to the Praga district of Warsaw. Berman, as a member of the Politburo of the PPR, was charged with oversight of the state security apparatus (the Ministry of Public Security). In post-war Poland Berman organized state censorship, supervised the development of, and permissions for political parties and organizations, and was the main liaison between the PPR and the PKWN. Berman&#x27;s decisions had to be consulted with and could be vetoed by two resident Soviet advisers, who remained in Poland until 1953 and 1954.

From 1948, together with Bolesław Bierut, general secretary of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR), a successor of the PPR, and economist Hilary Minc, Berman formed a triumvirate of Stalinist leaders of Poland. According to Lucyna Tych, Berman&#x27;s daughter, all three &quot;Stalinist&quot; leaders sought to implement communism in Poland in ways different from the manner in which it was done earlier in the Soviet Union (while remaining entirely loyal to the Soviet leadership). Berman and Minc were close friends and partners. They successfully cooperated in protecting Poland&#x27;s economic interests. For example, after their repeated interventions with the Soviets, the practice of dismantling industrial equipment in Poland and taking it to the Soviet Union was discontinued. They were somehow able to fend off Soviet attempts to introduce broader (Soviet-like) railroad tracks in Poland, which would cut-off Poland&#x27;s transportation links with Germany and the West.

In late 1949, Stalin attempted to remove Berman from his position of power, accusing him of participation in an international anti-communist conspiracy and illicit foreign contacts, but the effort did not succeed. In 1952 Berman&#x27;s friend Wasilewska, having found out Stalin&#x27;s plan to eliminate Berman, traveled from Kyiv to Warsaw to warn him. Berman attributed his own survival to Bierut&#x27;s protection.

In August 1951, Gomułka was arrested, probably on Stalin&#x27;s and Lavrentiy Beria&#x27;s orders; they demanded his quick trial. Berman and Bierut, however, managed to keep delaying the proceedings to the point that the trial never took place.

Berman became a member of the Politburo of the PZPR and remained in that capacity until 1956. He was responsible for science, literature and cultural affairs, propaganda and ideology. From 1949 to 1953, he was officially and personally involved in the fight for the dominant position of socialist realism in art and literature, but in the post-war years he also helped and cultivated contacts with many Polish artistic personalities and his influence was essential to the establishment and continuous existence of such Polish mainstream institutions as the &quot;Czytelnik&quot; publishing house or &quot;Cepelia&quot; chain of craft stores. The canon of classical Polish literature was published and the production of memorable films commenced. Berman helped Tadeusz Sygietyński organize the folk ensemble &quot;Mazowsze&quot;. Following Berman&#x27;s repeated interventions with Vyacheslav Molotov and other Soviet authorities, the Ossolineum collections were transferred from Lviv to Wrocław in 1946 and 1947. In the spring of 1955, Berman authorized the creation of the Crooked Circle Club, a free discussion forum in Warsaw, which marked the gradual departure from Stalinism.

While Berman was one of the officials responsible for party oversight of the security apparatus, at least 200,000 people were imprisoned and some 6,000 executed on political charges. Hundreds of former members of the Polish resistance movement in World War II were persecuted, especially from the Home Army and the National Armed Forces.

==Fall from power==

In 1952, Anna Duracz, Berman&#x27;s secretary, was arrested. In 1954, he was attacked during a party plenum by Aleksander Zawadzki, who claimed that, as he originated from a bourgeois Jewish family, Berman lacked a proper understanding of the Polish workers&#x27; movement. After the death of First Secretary Bierut, Berman resigned from the PZPR Politburo (and from the position of first deputy prime minister) in May 1956. He was earlier incriminated by Józef Światło, a former official in the Ministry of Public Security, who defected to the West. Berman was relieved from the Central Committee of the PZPR in the fall of 1956 and in May 1957, in the aftermath of the Polish October, dismissed from the party altogether. He attempted to get his membership reinstated, wrote appeals in 1960 and 1964, but was rejected on both occasions. He was considered responsible for the &quot;Stalinist-era errors and distortions&quot; by which they meant dogmatic and sectarian party attitudes and breaking the rule of law.

==Retirement==

For two years Bermam remained without steady employment and supported himself by accepting various assignments, such as translations of works by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In September 1958, Berman was placed by the party in the state-run &quot;Książka i Wiedza&quot; (&#x27;Book and Knowledge&#x27;) publishing house, where he worked until he was retired by the authorities in 1968. His wife was removed from her position at the Rheumatology Institute. For the first time, according to his daughter Lucyna Tychowa, Berman could enjoy normal life with his family and friends. He engaged in activities, such as reading or attending films and theatrical productions. In the autumn of 1981, he was hit by a car and permanently injured while he attempted to cross a street. He died in Warsaw in April 1984 and was buried at Powązki Cemetery.

== Notes ==
&quot;a.&quot; Speaking during a plenum of the PPR in October 1947, Berman strongly expressed his agreement with Gomułka&#x27;s views: &quot;It is our tremendous achievement, as communists, that we are able to create a national party, which has become deeply rooted in Polish society. ... It is our greatest treasure, which we have to defend, and will not ever allow anybody to push us back to the enchanted ring of the KPP. It had been our greatest disaster. ... We are not a communist party, we are the PPR&quot;. Already in August–September 1948, Berman found it necessary to alter his views in order to comply with Stalin&#x27;s current directives. They required the &quot;building of the foundations of socialism&quot; according to the Soviet example.

&quot;b.&quot; Berman told a story to Teresa Torańska, by whom he was interviewed in the early 1980s. Afterwards, he requested that Torańska refrains from printing it, because he was concerned that his revelations may reflect badly on Bierut, &quot;a noble man&quot;. Torańska published the account anyway.

In November 1949, at Belweder Palace, Bierut wanted to give Berman investigation files concerning cases of officers accused of political crimes, because he wanted Berman&#x27;s opinion on the matter. Berman declined to take the files, because he considered them contrived and worthless. He asked Bierut to make sure that no death sentences are issued based on such evidence. Berman soon regretted not having taken the files and cooperated with Bierut&#x27;s procedure. Bierut, who normally followed his advice, this time did not and twenty death sentences were eventually carried out. &quot;Unfortunately&quot;, lamented Berman, &quot;he believed in those papers too much&quot;.
&quot;c.&quot; The degree and nature of Berman&#x27;s involvement with the state security apparatus are matters of controversy. It is not known whether he was kept informed by Minister Stanisław Radkiewicz and his people, or whether they saw him, an idealistic communist, as an impediment to their operation. According to the testimony of people familiar with Berman in this role, he often alleviated the cruelties of the system. He had no formal decision-making capacity, which rested with Gomułka and Bierut, or with Radkiewicz at the operational level. On the other hand, as the communist regime struggled to contain the armed underground in the mid-1040s, Berman lobbied for an expansion of state security. Berman is also believed to be responsible for the lessening of political repression, which began in the later 1940s.

Berman, responsible for culture, was despised by the literary circles and others, on whom he had imposed harsh censorship and other restrictions. After the death of Bierut, Berman&#x27;s adversaries produced highly negative written evaluations of him in printed media and he quickly became a scapegoat for all the misdeeds of the Stalinist period. A &quot;good Bierut and bad Berman&quot; stereotype was created.

<text>Huntly Castle is a ruined castle north of Huntly in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, where the rivers Deveron and Bogie meet. It was the ancestral home of the chief of Clan Gordon, Earl of Huntly. There have been four castles built on the site that have been referred to as Huntly Castle, Strathbogie Castle or Peel of Strathbogie.

==Location==
Huntly Castle was built on the crossing of the rivers Deveron and Bogie, north of Huntly and roughly 40 miles from Aberdeen. The original wooden castle was built on a motte. The second castle, made of stone, was built on the northern end of the bailey. The third and modern castles were built to the east of the original, at the southern end of the estate.

==History==
The castle was originally built by Duncan II, Earl of Fife, on the Strathbogie estate sometime around 1180 and 1190. The castle became known as the Peel of Strathbogie.

The Earl Duncan&#x27;s third son, David, inherited the Strathbogie estate and later, through marriage, became earls of Atholl around 1204. During the Strathbogie family&#x27;s time at the estate, Robert the Bruce was a guest after falling ill at Inverurie. The family was loyal to him and when he got better, Robert the Bruce went on to win the battle of Bannockburn. However, around 1314, David of Strathbogie shifted his support to the English right before Robert the Bruce won the battle of Bannockburn. Robert the Bruce saw this as treachery and granted the castle and estate to Sir Adam Gordon of Huntly because he was consistently loyal. In 1506, the castle was officially renamed Huntly Castle.

===Reign of James IV===
Although the castle was burned to the ground, a grander castle was built in its place. In 1496, the pretender to the English throne, Perkin Warbeck, was married to Lady Catherine Gordon the daughter of George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, witnessed by King James IV of Scotland at Edinburgh. James IV came to Huntly in October 1501 and gave gifts of money to the stonemasons working on the castle. In October 1503, James IV came again and played in a shooting contest at a target called a &quot;prop&quot;. He came back again in the following October, on his way south, accompanied by four Italian minstrels and an African drummer known as the &quot;More taubronar&quot;. James IV played cards at the castle on 10 October 1505 and gave a tip to masons working on the building. These visits were part of his annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Duthac at Tain. Architecturally the &quot;L plan&quot; castle consists of a well-preserved five-story tower with an adjoining great hall and supporting buildings. Areas of the original ornate facade and interior stonework remain. Wings were added to the castle in the 16th and 17th centuries.
===Reign of Mary, Queen of Scots===
William Mackintosh was executed on 23 August 1550 at &quot;Castle Strathbogie&quot;, as a conspirator against the Earl of Huntly, the queen&#x27;s lieutenant in the North.

The English diplomat Thomas Randolph stayed two nights in September 1562, and wrote that the castle was &quot;fayer, beste furnishede of anye howse that I have seen in thys countrie.&quot; Mary, Queen of Scots decided to take the castle, giving as a cause that the Earl withheld from her a royal cannon lent to him by Regent Arran. She sent her half-brother John Stewart, Commendator of Coldingham to arrest the George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly at Huntly Castle in October 1562. On the day William Kirkcaldy of Grange and the Tutor of Pitcur arrived first and surrounded the house. While Kirkcaldy was talking to the castle porter, the castle watchman on the tower spotted Coldingham and the Master of Lindsay and their troops a mile off. He alerted the Earl, who ran without &quot;boot or sword&quot; and hopped over a low wall at the back of the castle and found a horse before Pitcur could stop him. Elizabeth Keith, Countess of Huntly then welcomed the queen&#x27;s men and gave them a meal and showed them around the place. She still had her chapel furnished for Roman Catholic worship.

George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly died after the Battle of Corrichie on 28 October 1562, and the castle was garrisoned for Mary, Queen of Scots by Charles Crawfurd and twenty soldiers. Furnishings including beds and 45 tapestries were carted to Aberdeen and shipped in barrels to Edinburgh for the royal collection and refurbishment by Servais de Condé. After the surrender of Mary, Queen of Scots, at the battle of Carberry Hill, the Earl of Bothwell came north to meet George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly at &quot;Stawboggye&quot;, and moved on to Spynie Castle after Huntly deserted his cause. In July 1570 the exiled Earl of Westmorland found refuge at Huntly.

===John Gordon, Earl of Sutheerland===
John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland and his wife Marion Seton were poisoned at Helmsdale Castle in 1567 by Isobel Sinclair, the wife of Gordon of Gartly. Isobel Seton&#x27;s own son also died, but the fifteen-year-old heir of Sutherland, Alexander Gordon was unharmed. He was made to marry the Earl of Caithness&#x27; daughter Barbara Sinclair. In 1569 he escaped from the Sinclairs to Huntly Castle and remained at Huntly until he came of age in 1573. Barbara Sinclair died, and Alexander Gordon, now Earl of Sutherland, married Jean Gordon, former wife of the Earl of Bothwell, who had also found a refuge at Huntly Castle.

===A fatal football match===
An early description of the death of George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly in 1576, compiled by Richard Bannatyne gives some details of how the castle was used. The Earl suffered a stroke, or a collapse caused by food poisoning, while playing football outside the Castle on the Green. He was taken through the outer gate to his bedchamber in the round tower of the palace block, which was then called the &quot;New Warke of Strathbogie.&quot; The Earl&#x27;s bedchamber was adjacent to his &quot;Grit Chalmer&quot;, the Great Chamber. After the Earl died, his body was laid out in the &quot;Chamber of Dais&quot;, another name for the Great Chamber, and his valuables were secured in the bedchamber. After the Earl&#x27;s steward left the castle, a number of alleged supernatural events occurred beginning with the sudden collapse of one of the servants in the &quot;Laich Chalmer&quot;, Low Chamber. This &quot;Laich Chalmer&quot; was in another part of the castle, under a stair opposite the &quot;Auld Hall.&quot; On the following day, a servant went up to the Gallery at the top of the &quot;New Warke&quot; where spices (which were precious) were stored. This servant and two companions also collapsed and when revived complained of feeling cold. After the Earl&#x27;s body was embalmed and taken to the chapel, his brother sat on a bench in the Hall by the Great Chamber door, and heard unexplained sounds from the chamber. It was said that &quot;there is not a live thing bigger than a mouse may enter in that chamber with the door locked.&quot;

===James VI slights the castle===
In March 1584 an English recusant Catholic Sir Thomas Gerard of Bryn was sent by Lady Ferniehirst to find refuge at Huntly. George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly was a Catholic and James VI decided to subdue his power in the north. The king arrived at Huntly on 26 April 1589 after spending a night at Kintore. The Earl of Huntly had fled to the mountains, stripping the countryside and emptying the house of furniture. James brought 100 workmen to demolish the castle. Huntly sent the king an offer to spare the house and surrendered.

In March 1593 a royal garrison of 16 men commanded by Archie Carmichael was to be put in Huntly Castle. In May 1593 the Earl captured a man called Pedder in the lands of Atholl. Pedder was hanged and dismembered and his body parts displayed on poles at Huntly.

In July 1594 Huntly was overseeing the building of a new hall and gallery. Following the battle of Glenlivet, James VI came with workmen again and his master of works William Schaw, and planned to blow up the &quot;gret old tower&quot; which had been &quot;fourteen years in building&quot; on 29 October 1594. The kirk minister Andrew Melville was with the king and a vocal advocate for demolition. Aberdeen town council bought twenty stones in weight of gunpowder for the demolition of Huntly and other places, and sent the stonemason John Fraser and other workmen to the demolition work at Huntly and Old Slains Castle, equipped with new shovels.

The royal council met at Terrisoule to discuss the planned demolition on 28 October. Some Lords wanted the fortress kept to hold a loyal garrison. James VI still wished the whole castle, the new and old work, to be slighted. It was decided not to completely demolish Huntly and Slains Castle and other houses, but preserve them for the convenience of the royal garrisons. It was also said that the pleas of the Countesses of Huntly and Erroll to save the houses were successful. David Foulis wrote to Anthony Bacon that Henrietta Stewart, Countess of Huntly, watched the demolition at Huntly and was not allowed to have an audience with the king to plead her case. The king made his friend Sir John Gordon of Pitlurg the keeper of the remaining buildings at Huntly.

===Restored for a Marquess===

The Marquess of Huntly restored and rebuilt the castle. In 1746, an English soldier, James Ray, saw the ruins and commented on ceilings, still decorated with &quot;history-painting&quot;.

Huntly spent large sums restoring and enlarging the castle in April 1597. The restored facade of the main block was carved with the names and titles of the marquess, &quot;George Gordon&quot; and his wife, &quot;Henrietta Stewart&quot; who was a favourite of the queen, Anne of Denmark. In February 1603 James VI made plans to resolve the Marquess&#x27;s feuds including a royal visit to Huntly with Anne of Denmark and the Earl of Moray later in the year. The visit did not take place because of the death of Elizabeth I and the subsequent Union of the Crowns.

In 1640 the Castle was occupied by the Scottish Covenanter army under Major-General Robert Monro (d. 1680). James Gordon Parson of Rothiemay tells us how the house &quot;was preserved from being rifled or defaced, except some emblems and imagery, which looked somewhat popish and superstitious lycke; and therefore, by the industry of one captain James Wallace (one of Munro&#x27;s foote captaines) were hewd and brocke doune off the frontispiece of the house; but all the rest of the frontispiece containing Huntly&#x27;s scutcheon, etc, was left untouched, as it stands to this daye.&quot;

Captured in October 1644, the castle was briefly held by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose against the Duke of Argyll. In 1647 it was gallantly defended against General David Leslie by Lord Charles Gordon, but its &#x27;Irish&#x27; garrison was starved into surrender. Savage treatment was meted out, for the men were hanged and their officers beheaded. In December of the same year the Marquess of Huntly himself was captured and on his way to execution at Edinburgh was detained, by a refinement of cruelty, in his own mansion. His escort was shot against its walls.

An inventory made by the garrison shows the state rooms were still fully furnished, including the earl&#x27;s &#x27;chapel bed&#x27;. In 1650 Charles II visited briefly on his way to the Battle of Worcester, defeat and exile. The Civil War brought an end to the Gordon of Huntly family&#x27;s long occupation of the castle.

In 1689, during the first Jacobite rising, the castle was briefly the headquarters for Viscount Dundee and his Jacobite army, at the end of April, just after the start of the revolt. However, by the early eighteenth century the castle was already in decay and providing material for predatory house builders in the village. In 1746, during a later Jacobite rising, it was occupied by British government troops. Thereafter, it became a common quarry until a groundswell of antiquarian sentiment in the 19th century came to the rescue of the noble pile.

Huntly Castle remained under the ownership of the Clan Gordon until 1923. Today, the remains of the castle are cared for by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.

Pure Strength I, a major international strongman competition, was held on the grounds of Huntly Castle in 1987. The winner of the contest was Jón Páll Sigmarsson of Iceland.

<doc id="626834" wikidata="Q507662" url="?curid=626834" title="Sādhanā">
<text>Sādhanā (; ; ) is an ego-transcending spiritual practice in Indian religions. It includes a variety of disciplines in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain traditions that are followed in order to achieve various spiritual or ritual objectives.

Sadhana is done for attaining detachment from worldly things, which can be a goal of a sadhu. Karma yoga, bhakti yoga and jnana yoga can also be described as sadhana; constant efforts to achieve maximum level of perfection in all streams of day-to-day life can be described as Sadhana.

&quot;Sādhanā&quot; can also refer to a tantric liturgy or liturgical manual, that is, the instructions to carry out a certain practice.

==Definitions==
The historian N. Bhattacharyya provides a working definition of the benefits of sādhanā as follows:
B. K. S. Iyengar (1993: p. 22), in his English translation of and commentary to the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot;, defines sādhanā in relation to abhyāsa and kriyā:
== Paths ==
The term sādhanā means &quot;methodical discipline to attain desired knowledge or goal&quot;. Sadhana is also done for attaining detachment from worldly things, which itself can be the goal. A person undertaking such a practice is known in Sanskrit as a sādhu (female &quot;sādhvi&quot;), sādhaka (female &quot;sādhakā&quot;) or yogi (Tibetan &quot;pawo&quot;; feminine yogini or dakini, Tibetan &quot;khandroma&quot;). The goal of sādhanā is to attain some level of spiritual realization, which can be either enlightenment, pure love of God (prema), liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (saṃsāra), or a particular goal such as the blessings of a deity as in the Bhakti traditions.

Sādhanā can involve meditation, chanting of mantra sometimes with the help of prayer beads, puja to a deity, yajña, and in very rare cases mortification of the flesh or tantric practices such as performing one&#x27;s particular &quot;sādhanā&quot; within a cremation ground.

Traditionally in some Hindu and Buddhist traditions in order to embark on a specific path of sādhanā, a guru may be required to give the necessary instructions. This approach is typified by some Tantric traditions, in which initiation by a guru is sometimes identified as a specific stage of sādhanā. On the other hand, individual renunciates may develop their own spiritual practice without participating in organized groups.

== In Yoga ==
The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; has 196 sūtras with ideas and wisdom that a sādhaka can take for a path towards self-realization. B. K. S. Iyengar (1993: p. 3) notes that:Kriyāyoga gives us the practical disciplines needed to scale the spiritual heights...the four padas of the Yoga Sūtras describe different disciplines of practice, the qualities or aspects of which vary according to the development of intelligence and refinement of consciousness of each sādhaka. In the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; II.1, Patañjali and his commentators write that the Kriyāyoga (action-oriented type of yoga) is to be undertaken by those whose mind is not already fixed. The fixing or &quot;stilling of the changing states of mind&quot; (&quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; I.2) is the goal of yoga, for which Kriyāyoga is necessary as a first step for a sādhaka. There are three aspects of Kriyāyoga:

# Discipline - &quot;tapas,&quot; comprises the &quot;sāttvicizing&quot; of one&#x27;s sensual engagements or controlling one&#x27;s senses and making sure that what they consume is amenable to a &quot;sattvic&quot; mind.
# Study - &quot;svādhyāya,&quot; is taken by Vyāsa, the main commentator on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, to refer to the chanting of &quot;mantras&quot; (an act which is usually termed j&quot;apa&quot;) and the study of scriptures (&quot;jñāna&quot;). 
# Dedication to God - &quot;Īśvara-praṇidhāna&quot;, meaning dedicating all of ones actions to God (&quot;Īśvara&quot;), which the commentators implicitly refer to the &quot;bhakti&quot;-centered karma-yoga that is described in the second chapter of the Gita.
Vachaspati Mishra, an influential commentator on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, notes that these three aspects of Kriyāyoga are necessary in order to purify the mind, making it more &quot;sāttvic&quot; than &quot;rājasic&quot; or &quot;tāmasic&quot;. Such purity of the mind allows one to then cultivate practice (&quot;abhyāsa&quot;) and dispassion (&quot;vairāgya&quot;), which are prerequisites for achieving the stilling of the mind.

== Bhakti and Sadhana ==
In Vaishnavism, &quot;bhakti&quot;, or devotional practice, is categorized into two types: the practice itself (&quot;sadhana&quot;) and the perfectional state of that practice (&quot;siddhi&quot;). Jiva Goswami uses the terms &quot;sadhana&quot;-&quot;bhakti&quot; (bhakti as the means) and &quot;sadhya&quot;-&quot;bhakti&quot; (&quot;bhakti&quot; as the end). Chaitanya Vaishnavas engage in &quot;raganuga-sadhana&quot;, a meditative practice emulating the spontaneous love of Krishna&#x27;s close companions. This form of devotion, while potentially reducing the emphasis on ritual practices, still involves the worship of Krishna&#x27;s image.

== Buddhism ==
In Vajrayāna Buddhism and the Nalanda tradition, there are fifteen major tantric &quot;sādhanās&quot;:
# Śūraṅgama/Sitātapatrā
# Nīlakaṇṭha
# Tārā
# Mahākāla
# Hayagrīva
# Amitābha
# Bhaiṣajyaguru/Akṣobhya
# Guhyasamāja
# Vajrayoginī/Vajravārāhī
# Heruka/Cakrasaṃvara
# Yamāntaka
# Kālacakra
# Hevajra
# Chöd
# Vajrapāṇi
#Avalokiteśvara

All of these are available in Tibetan form, many are available in Chinese and some are still extant in ancient Sanskrit manuscripts.

Kværne (1975: p. 164) in his extended discussion of sahajā, treats the relationship of sādhanā to mandala thus:

<text>The Herdwick is a breed of domestic sheep native to the Lake District in North West England. The name &quot;Herdwick&quot; is derived from the Old Norse &quot;herdvyck&quot;, meaning sheep pasture. Though low in lambing capacity and perceived wool quality when compared to more common commercial breeds, Herdwicks are prized for their robust health, their ability to live solely on forage, and their tendency to be territorial and not to stray over the difficult upland terrain of the Lake District. It is considered that up to 99% of all Herdwick sheep are commercially farmed in the central and western Lake District.

The wool of a Herdwick has unique qualities relating to durability. Thick bristle type fibres will often protrude from garments made from the wool, forming a protective layer in blizzards—most likely the same qualities that protect the sheep in similar conditions. Herdwicks have been known to survive under a blanket of snow for three days while eating their own wool.

Severely threatened by the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England and Wales, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve this unique animal as a crucial part of traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far fewer in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies.

==History==
===Early history===

The root word of the breed&#x27;s name, &quot;herdvyck&quot;, &quot;sheep pasture&quot;, is recorded in documents dating back to the 12th century. The origin of the breed itself is unknown, but the most common theory is that the ancestors of Herdwick sheep were introduced by early Norse settlers. According to this, it was brought to the region somewhere between the 10th and 11th centuries during the Viking invasions of western England. Although a piece of local folklore once suggested that it came from a wrecked Spanish Armada ship, it appears that the Herdwick was an important breed in the Lake District by the end of the 12th century.

For centuries, the husbandry of Herdwick sheep has been a large factor in shaping the culture and terrain of the Lake District. Topographically, grazing by sheep continues to keep the hillsides of fells largely treeless, and the ubiquitous dry stone walls of the valleys were built to protect grazing land and to confine livestock. Linguistically, many words of Lakeland speech relate to sheep husbandry. The ancient &quot;Yan Tan Tethera&quot; counting system for sheep is a survival of Brittonic counting systems.

====Beatrix Potter====
In the later years of her life (over 50), the children&#x27;s author Beatrix Potter was involved with keeping and breeding Herdwicks, even acting as president of the breed association for a time. Between 1930 and 1938 she won a number of prizes for Herdwick ewes at shows across Cumbria. Upon her death in 1943, she bequeathed fifteen farms—a total of approximately 4,000 acres (16 km2) to the National Trust and, as per her instruction, all continue to graze Herdwick flocks.

===Modern history===

In the modern era, the main industry of the Lake District has shifted from agriculture to tourism. The subsequent influx of tourists to the District has at times conflicted with traditional life, including the raising of Herdwicks. One Lake District farmer summed the problem up as, &quot;We get 100,000 visitors across our land every year... If just one in a thousand forgets to shut a gate or can&#x27;t be bothered, that&#x27;s a hundred times we have to go out and round up our sheep.&quot;

In the late 20th century, the keeping of Herdwicks became economically unviable without outside support; open market prices for Herdwick fleeces sometimes drop as low as a penny a kilogram (which is about the weight of wool from a single sheep). Without direct monetary guarantees for wool prices from the National Trust, it actually costs farmers a considerably larger amount of money to shear their Herdwicks than they would receive in compensation; the majority of farmers once burned their fleeces as waste products. The Trust now acts as a wool merchant itself, thus being able to bargain for better prices directly with the British Wool Marketing Board and operate a Herdwick wool trademark. Most farmers survive through the sale of lambs, as well as both National Trust and European Union farm subsidies. Lake District farmers in particular receive subsidies for operating in a designated Less Favoured Area from the England Rural Development Programme. Those who agree to maintain their land in accordance with sustainable farming practices also receive additional subsidies.

Ninety-five percent of all 50,000 or so Herdwicks live within 14 miles of Coniston, Cumbria, and this makes them particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of disease. The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001 led to the destruction of many flocks, and to fears for the survival both of the breed and of the typical Lakeland sheep farming industry. Of the estimated 100,000 Herdwick sheep present before the outbreak, a full 25% were lost. They were not easily replaceable because long-standing herds are hefted so the introduction of new stock to the fells would have required extensive fencing. The call for vaccination rather than culling to preserve what is considered a part of the traditional identity of the fells and moors was led by parties such as the Duke of Westminster, Earl Peel, Lord Barnard and Lord Lonsdale, who wished to save the hill sheep on their lands. Many Lake District residents saw the breed as an indispensable icon of the region. Longtime resident and writer for &quot;The Guardian&quot; A. Harry Griffin expressed this feeling:

There are other mountain sheep on the Lakeland fells, notably Swaledales and Rough-Fells, but the hardy Herdwick is the sheep most likely to be seen in and around the Duddon valley, the Coniston fells, the Buttermere fells and, through Borrowdale or Wasdale, up to the highest land in England, the Scafells. More than the old drystone walls that quarter the fells, the packhorse bridges or the whitewashed farmsteads, the little grey Herdwick sheep typify the Lakeland.

If they and their shepherds go, that is the end of the Lakeland where I have climbed, walked, skied and skated for nearly 80 years; of the Lakeland I have written about nearly all my life. The destruction of entire flocks meant that the shepherds were forced to undergo the process of again &quot;heafing&quot; (the local term for &quot;hefting&quot;) their new sheep to the hills. Normally, ewes teach this behaviour to their lambs, but with no more ewes left acquainted with a particular heaf the behaviour had to be taught all over again to new ewes, inevitably involving much rounding up of flocks that had strayed over the often inaccessible fells. Unheafed sheep might also cause overgrazing by wandering if they replaced the original Herdwicks. The Cumbria Hill Sheep Initiative was set up to &quot;reassess the position and circumstances&quot; in the aftermath of the disease; tough government restrictions in order to prevent another outbreak are still in place.

In 2008, an Oregon sheep farmer began importing semen from Herdwick rams into the United States to begin a breeding programme using artificial insemination and designed to bring the breed to the country for the first time. In 2013, Lakeland Herdwick meat received a Protected Designation of Origin from the European Union.

==Characteristics==
Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, producing strongly flavoured lamb and mutton and a coarse, grey wool. The slowly maturing breed is one of the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her &quot;heaf&quot; (the local term for &quot;heft&quot;), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.

A Herdwick&#x27;s grey fleece is not easily dyed and is coarse, so it is best suited to use as carpet wool. The wool is also an excellent natural insulator; it is possible to buy sheets of fireproofed wool to fit as loft insulation. Herdwick lamb and mutton has a very distinct taste, and was eaten at Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 1953 coronation banquet. Herdwick ewes also commonly produce desirable market lambs and mules by cross-breeding with Suffolk, Cheviot, Charollais and Texel sheep.

Herdwick lambs are born black and, after a year, they lighten to a dark brown colour (the sheep are called &quot;hoggs&quot; or &quot;hoggets&quot; at this stage). After the first shearing, their fleece lightens further to grey. Rams are horned and ewes polled. For shows and auctions, Herdwicks traditionally have their wool &quot;ruddied up&quot; (the local term for &quot;raddled&quot;) with dye. Rams are also ruddied when put out with the ewes to show which have been mated and the dye is also one method (called a &quot;smit&quot;) of marking sheep for ownership. Before chemical dyes became available, this dye was made from either iron ore or graphite mixed with grease. For many years the legal method of identifying a particular shepherd&#x27;s sheep were notches cut out of a sheep&#x27;s ear, called &quot;lug&quot; marks—now replaced by ear tags.

<doc id="626840" wikidata="Q1376429" url="?curid=626840" title="Józef Unszlicht">
<text>Józef Unszlicht or Iosif Stanislavovich Unshlikht (; nicknames &quot;Jurowski&quot;, &quot;Leon&quot;; 31 December 1879 – 29 July 1938) was a Polish and Russian revolutionary activist, a Soviet government official and one of the founders of the Cheka.

==Biography==
Unszlicht was born on 31 December 1879. He was born in Mława, Płock Governorate, Congress Poland, in a Jewish family. He joined the revolutionary movement in 1896, as a student in Warsaw studying electrical engineering. In 1900, he joined the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (SDKPiL), led by Rosa Luxemburg and Leo Jogiches. For his conspiratorial activities in Warsaw and Łódź, he was arrested seven times in 1902–13. In 1911, he joined the &quot;rozlamovists&quot;, a group of mainly younger SDPKiL members, led by Yakov Ganetsky, who opposed Jogiches&#x27; leadership methods, and who were close to Vladimir Lenin and the Bolsheviks. The split became so acrimonious that the SDPKiL leadership accused Unszlicht of being a police agent, an accusation that seems to have been baseless.

At the time of the February Revolution, Unszlicht was in exile in Siberia, where he was elected a member of the Irkutsk soviet, and joined the Bolsheviks. In April, he moved to Petrograd, where he helped organise the Bolsheviks&#x27; military organisation. He was arrested for his role in the July Days and held in Krestny prison, but soon released. In December 1917, he was one of the founders of Cheka. In 1919 he served briefly as People&#x27;s Commissar for Military Affairs in Lithuania and Belarus. In April, he led the defence of Wilno (Vilnius) as it was being overrun by the Polish army, commanded by Józef Piłsudski.

In May 1920, after the Polish army had been forced to retreat, Unszlicht ingratiated Lenin by advising him that if the Red Army invaded Poland, they would be welcomed as liberators by the Polish workers and peasants. During the Polish–Soviet War, he was a member of the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee, which would have become the government of communist Poland had the Poles lost the war.

In 1921, Unszlicht was appointed Deputy head of Cheka, under Felix Dzerzhinsky, but they fell out in 1923, after a series of bomb attacks in Warsaw, which Unszlicht appears to have instigated, without consulting Dzerzhinsky or the leadership of the Communist Party of Poland. He was transferred to the post of chief of supply for the Red Army, although Leon Trotsky, the People&#x27;s Commissar for War, regarded him as &quot;an ambitious but talentless intriguer&quot; who had been placed there to undermine him. On 6 February 1925, he was appointed Deputy People&#x27;s Commissar for War. In 1930, he was transferred to economic work, in an apparent demotion. In September 1933, he was appointed head of the Civil Air Fleet. In February 1935, he replaced Avel Yenukidze as Secretary of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union.
== Arrest and execution == 
Józef Unszlicht was arrested on 11 June 1937. Two weeks later, the head of the NKVD, Nikolay Yezhov told a plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party that the police had uncovered a &quot;Polish Military Organisation&quot; (POV) of spies who had infiltrated the USSR by posing as political émigrés, and named Unszlicht as its leader. He confessed under interrogation, and named as his &#x27;accomplices&#x27; most of the leading members of the Polish Communist Party in exile, who were arrested and shot. He retracted his testimony during his 20-minute trial, on 28 July 1938, saying that he had never been a member of the POV and confessed only because &quot;he could not endure a long interrogation&quot; – implying that his interrogators had used sleep deprivation to break him – but was sentenced to death and executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground on 29 July 1938. He was rehabilitated in 1956.

== Family ==
Unszlicht&#x27;s brother Julian was a journalist who &quot;fought against the socialist movement in general and especially against Jewish involvement in it.&quot; In later years, Julian converted to Catholicism and joined the priesthood.

His wife, Stefania was arrested for being the wife of a convicted counter-revolutionary and sentenced in August 1938 to either five or eight years in labour camps. She was released in 1943. They had a son, Kasimir, a student and member of Komsomol, who died in 1929, aged 19.

According to Walter Krivitsky, an intelligence officer who defected to the West, Unszlicht had a nephew, Max Maximov-Unszlicht, who was chief of the Soviet military intelligence operating in Nazi Germany for nearly three years and was also arrested and probably executed during the Great Purge.

<text>The National Research Tomsk State University, TSU () is a public research university located in Tomsk, Russia. The university, which opened in 1888, was the first university in the Asian part of Russia and, in practice, the first Russian university East of the Volga.

TSU comprises 22 faculties and institutes with 152 departments, serving approximately 18,000 students. In 2022, the university was ranked #272 by QS World University Rankings, #601 by World University Rankings by &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, and #901 by &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;.

== History ==
===Imperial University===
On May 16 (28 N.S.), 1878, Emperor Alexander II signed a decree on the establishment of the first higher education institution between the Russian Urals and the Pacific Ocean. The move was supported by major industrialist and businessmen, who contributed with private funds, as well as by local city councils in Siberia, but was opposed by conservative voices within the State Council, notably Konstantin Pobedonostsev, who complained about the cost of the project and the fact that local Tomsk society consisted of &quot;all sorts of rabble&quot;. Nevertheless, the project progressed, albeit slowly, and on September 1, 1888 the first faculty (medicine) of the Siberian Imperial University named after His Imperial Majesty Alexander III () finally opened. Classes to the first 72 students were handled by eight professors, aided by seven assistants and laboratory technicians. Professor Nikolai Gezekhus was appointed the first rector of the University. It would take a decade for the second faculty of the university (Law) to become operational.

===Recent history===

In March 2022, Eduard Vladimirovich Galazhinsky, Rector of the university, was suspended by the European University Association (EUA) following support for the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Union of Rectors (RUR), for being &quot;diametrically opposed to the European values that they committed to when joining EUA”. Professor Terry Callaghan, who had helped establish 21 Russian environmental research stations in the Arctic, paused his professorship at Tomsk State University after the rectors’ statement.

<doc id="626853" wikidata="Q3257510" url="?curid=626853" title="Grand Duke of Finland">
<text>The Grand Duke of Finland, alternatively the Grand Prince of Finland after 1802, was, from around 1580 to 1809, a title in use by most Swedish monarchs. Between 1809 and 1917, it was included in the title of the emperor of Russia, who was also the ruler of the Grand Duchy of Finland.

==Swedish rule==
Around 1580, King Johan III of Sweden, who had previously (1556–63) been the duke of Finland (a royal duke), assumed the subsidiary title &quot;Grand Duke of Finland&quot; (, to the titles of the king of Sweden, first appearing in sources in 1581 (though first used by Johan III in 1577). In those years, Johan was and had been in a quarrel with his eastern neighbour, Tsar Ivan IV of Russia (&quot;the Terrible&quot;), who had a long list of subsidiary titles as the grand duke of several ancient Russian principalities and provinces. The use of the title of grand duke on Johan&#x27;s behalf was a countermeasure to signify his mighty position as sovereign of Sweden, also a multinational or multi-country realm, and equal to a tsardom. Not only was Finland added, but Karelia, Ingria, and Livonia, all of which were along the Swedish–Russian border. It is said that the first use of the new title was in an occasion to contact Tsar Ivan.

During the next 140 years, the title was used by Johan&#x27;s successors on the Swedish throne, with the exception of Charles IX, who listed Finns as one of the many nations over which he was the king during 1607–1611. As the title had only subsidiary nature without any concrete meaning, it was mainly used at formal occasions along with a long list of additional royal titles. The last Swedish monarch to use the title was Queen Ulrika Eleonora, who abdicated in 1720. In 1802, King Gustav IV Adolf gave the title to his new-born son, Prince Carl Gustaf, who died three years later.

==Russian rule==

During the Finnish War between Sweden and Russia, the four estates of occupied Finland were assembled at the Diet of Porvoo on 29 March 1809 to pledge allegiance to Emperor Alexander I of Russia, who had already earlier during the war adopted the title of grand duke (also translated as grand prince) of Finland to his long list of titles. Following the Swedish defeat in the war and the signing of the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on 17 September 1809, Finland became in some aspects an autonomous grand duchy, as in an informal real union with the Russian Empire.

The grand duke ruled Finland through his governor-general and a national senate appointed by him. Although no grand duke ever explicitly recognised Finland as a separate state in its own right, the country nevertheless enjoyed a high degree of autonomy even before its independence in 1917.

Finland was declared an independent nation state on 6 December 1917. After the Civil War in 1918, there was a brief attempt to make Finland a kingdom from 9 October to 14 December 1918.

In 1919, Finland was declared a republic. Since then, all titles of monarchs are obsolete in the country.

<text>A webcast is a media presentation distributed over the Internet using streaming media technology to distribute a single content source to many simultaneous listeners/viewers. A webcast may either be distributed live or on demand. Essentially, webcasting is &quot;broadcasting&quot; over the Internet.

The largest &quot;webcasters&quot; include existing radio and TV stations, who &quot;simulcast&quot; their output through online TV or online radio streaming, as well as a multitude of Internet-only &quot;stations&quot;. Webcasting usually consists of providing non-interactive linear streams or events. Rights and licensing bodies offer specific &quot;webcasting licenses&quot; to those wishing to carry out Internet broadcasting using copyrighted material.

==Overview==
Webcasting is used extensively in the commercial sector for investor relations presentations (such as annual general meetings), in e-learning (to transmit seminars), and for related communications activities. However, webcasting does not bear much, if any, relationship to web conferencing, which is designed for many-to-many interaction.

The ability to webcast using cheap/accessible technology has allowed independent media to flourish. There are many notable independent shows that broadcast regularly online. Often produced by average citizens in their homes they cover many interests and topics. Webcasts relating to computers, technology, and news are particularly popular and many new shows are added regularly.

Webcasting differs from podcasting in that webcasting refers to live streaming while podcasting simply refers to media files placed on the Internet.

The term &quot;webcast&quot; had previously been used to describe the distribution of Web or Internet content using conventional broadcast technologies such as those intended for digital video (Digital Video Broadcasting) and audio (Digital Audio Broadcasting), and in some cases even leveraging analogue broadcasting techniques traditionally used by Teletext services to deliver a limited &quot;Best of the Web&quot; selection of content to audiences. Overnight broadcasts of data via analogue television signals were claimed by WebTV representatives to be able to offer &quot;a fresh gigabyte of data every day... while you sleep&quot;. Typically, webcasting referred to a form of datacasting involving higher bandwidth broadcast technologies delivering Web content, multimedia files in particular, and with any interactivity supported by lower bandwidth return channels such as dial-up Internet access over the public telephone network or communication over mobile telephone networks. Such return channels conveyed each user&#x27;s requests for the delivery of specific content over the broadcast medium. Eventually, DVB satellite operators were to offer a higher bandwidth return channel using DVB-RCS, raising the prospect of &quot;point-to-point connections with users&#x27; satellite dishes&quot;. Webcasting had been regarded as a way of providing higher bandwidth Internet access to home computer users as well as enabling television-based Internet access, driving the development of smart television products.

==History==
The earliest graphically oriented web broadcasts were not streaming video, but were in fact still frames which were photographed with a web camera every few minutes while they were being broadcast live over the Internet. These broadcasts were not referred to as &quot;webcasts&quot; at the time. One of the earliest instances of sequential live image broadcasting was in 1991 when a camera was set up next to the Trojan Room in the computer laboratory of the University of Cambridge. It provided a live picture every few minutes of the office coffee pot to all desktop computers on that office&#x27;s network. A couple of years later its broadcasts went to the Internet, became known as the Trojan Room Coffee Pot webcam, and gained international notoriety as a feature of the fledgling World Wide Web.

In April 1995, a program called Webcast, from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) was demonstrated at the Third International World Wide Web Conference (now known as The Web Conference) in Darmstadt, Germany. Webcast used NCSA Mosaic for X to broadcast pages from the lecturer&#x27;s browser to other connected browsers on the Mbone in real time.

Later in 1996 an American college student and conceptual artist, Jenny Ringley, set up a web camera similar to the Trojan Room Coffee Pot&#x27;s webcam in her dorm room. That webcam photographed her every few minutes while it broadcast those images live over the Internet upon a site called &quot;JenniCam&quot;. Ringley wanted to portray all aspects of her lifestyle and the camera captured her doing almost everything – brushing her teeth, doing her laundry, and even having sex with her boyfriend. Her website generated millions of hits upon the Internet, became a pay site in 1998, and spawned hundreds of female imitators who would then use streaming video to create a new billion dollar industry called &quot;camming&quot;, and brand themselves as camgirls or webcam models.

One of the earliest examples of a webcasting concert was by Apple Computer&#x27;s Webcasting Group in partnership with the entrepreneurs Michael Dorf and Andrew Rasiej. Together with David B. Pakman from Apple, they launched the Macintosh New York Music Festival on July 17–22, 1995. This event audio webcast concerts from more than 15 clubs in New York City. Apple later webcast a concert by Metallica on June 10, 1996, live from Slim&#x27;s in San Francisco.

In 1995, Benford E. Standley produced one of the first audio/video webcasts in history.

On October 31, 1996, UK rock band Caduseus broadcast their one-hour concert from 11pm to 12midnight (UT) at Celtica in Machynlleth, Wales, UK – the first live streamed audio and simultaneous live streamed video multicast – around the globe to more than twenty direct &quot;mirrors&quot; in more than twenty countries.

In September 1997, Nebraska Public Television started webcasting Big Red Wrap Up from Lincoln, Nebraska which combined highlights from every Cornhusker football game, coverage of the coaches&#x27; weekly press conferences, analysis with Nebraska sportswriters, appearances by special guests and questions and answers with viewers.

On August 8, 1997, the American jam band Phish webcast one of their concerts for the first time.

On October 22, 1998, the first Billy Graham Crusade was broadcast live to a worldwide audience from the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, courtesy of Dale Ficken and the WebcastCenter in Pennsylvania. The live signal was broadcast via satellite to PA, then encoded and streamed via the BGEA website.

On February 6, 1999, a 21-minute Victoria&#x27;s Secret fashion show featuring supermodel Tyra Banks aired exclusively on Broadcast.com. The webcast was promoted by a 30-second television spot during Super Bowl XXXIII and drew an estimated 1.5 million viewers. Broadcast.com servers were reportedly overwhelmed by the spike in traffic, locking out many potential viewers.

Virtually all major broadcasters now have a webcast of their output, from the BBC to CNN to Al Jazeera to UNTV in television to Radio China, Vatican Radio, United Nations Radio and the World Service in radio.

On November 4, 1994, Stef van der Ziel distributed the first live video images over the web from the Simplon venue in Groningen. On November 7, 1994, WXYC, the college radio station of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill became the first radio station in the world to broadcast its signal over the internet.

Translated versions including subtitling are now possible using Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL).

==Wedcast==
A webcast of a wedding may be called a wedcast; it allows family and friends of the couple to watch the wedding in real time on the Internet. It is sometimes used for weddings in exotic locations, where it would be expensive or difficult for people to travel to see the wedding in person.

On August 13, 1998, the first webcast wedding took place, between Alan K&#x27;necht and Carrie Silverman in Toronto Canada.

The first webcast teleconference wedding to date is believed to have occurred on December 31, 1998. Dale Ficken and Lorrie Scarangella wed on this date as they stood in a church in Pennsylvania, and were married by Jerry Falwell while he sat in his office in Lynchburg, Virginia.

Webcasting a funeral is also a service provided by some funeral homes. Although it has been around since at least 2005, cheaper broadband access, the financial strain of travel, and deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan have all led to increased use of the technology.

<text>Ballindalloch Castle, known as the &quot;pearl of the north&quot;, is a Scottish castle located in Ballindalloch, Banffshire, Scotland. It has been the family home of Macpherson-Grants since 1546.

==History==
The first tower of the &quot;Z plan&quot; castle was built in 1546.

In 1590 the widow of the Grant of Ballindalloch married John Gordon, son Thomas Gordon of Cluny. John Grant, former Tutor of Ballindaloch, the administrator of the estate, killed one of John Grant&#x27;s servants. This started a feud between the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Moray. The Earl of Huntly went to Ballindalloch in November 1590 to arrest the Tutor. The Chief of Grant, John Grant of Freuchie promised to deliver the Tutor and his accomplices, accused of murder and other crimes, to Huntly Castle. However, Freuchie joined with the Tutor&#x27;s men and the Earl of Moray, and came to Darnaway Castle, and there shot pistols at Huntly&#x27;s officers and cannon from the castle, and killed John Gordon, brother of the Laird of Cluny.

After it was plundered and burned by James Graham, the first Marquess of Montrose, it was restored in 1645.

Extensions were added in 1770 by General James Grant of the American Wars of Independence (whose ghost is said to haunt the castle) and in 1850 by the architect Thomas MacKenzie. Further extensions carried out in 1878 were mostly demolished during modernisation enacted in 1965. It has been continuously occupied by Russell and Macpherson-Grant families throughout its existence.

The castle houses an important collection of 17th century Spanish paintings. 

The castle grounds contain a 20th-century rock garden and a 17th-century dovecote. The rivers Spey and Avon flow through the grounds, offering excellent fishing. The famous Aberdeen Angus cattle herd resides in the castle estate.

Today, the castle is still occupied by the Macpherson-Grant family. It is open to tourists during the summer months and a number of workshops on its grounds are in active use.

==Traditions==
It is said that the original intention was to build at a better site defensively, but when building commenced whatever was built in the day was thrown down at night. Eventually the laird, annoyed by the problem, heard a mysterious voice saying &quot;Build in the cow haughs, and you will meet with no interruptions.&quot; He did so, and there was no further problem with the building.

==Whisky==
With the assistance of a £1.2 million grant from the Scottish Government, the owners of the castle set up the Ballindalloch distillery on the estate farm. The distillery commenced production in September 2014. 

== Ghostlore ==
The dining room of Ballindalloch has associated ghostlore and is said to be haunted by a ghost known as &quot;The Green Lady.&quot; The green lady is a reoccurring character in Scottish ghostlore stories about castles.

<doc id="626861" wikidata="Q1456383" url="?curid=626861" title="Situs inversus">
<text>Situs inversus (also called situs transversus or oppositus) is a congenital condition in which the major visceral organs are reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. The normal arrangement of internal organs is known as &quot;situs solitus&quot;. Although cardiac problems are more common, many people with &quot;situs inversus&quot; have no medical symptoms or complications resulting from the condition, and until the advent of modern medicine, it was usually undiagnosed.

&quot;Situs inversus&quot; is found in about 0.01% of the population, or about 1 person in 10,000. In the most common situation, &quot;situs inversus totalis&quot;, it involves complete transposition (right to left reversal) of all of the viscera. The heart is not in its usual position in the left chest, but is on the right, a condition known as &quot;dextrocardia&quot; (). Because the relationship between the organs is not changed, most people with &quot;situs inversus&quot; have no associated medical symptoms or complications.

An uncommon form of &quot;situs inversus&quot; is isolated levocardia, in which the position of the heart is not mirrored alongside the other organs. Isolated levocardia carries a risk of heart defects, and so patients with the condition may require surgery to correct them.

In rarer cases such as &quot;situs ambiguus&quot; or heterotaxy, &quot;situs&quot; cannot be determined. In these patients, the liver may be midline, the spleen absent or multiple, and the bowel malrotated. Often, structures are duplicated or absent altogether. This is more likely to cause medical problems than &quot;situs inversus totalis&quot;.

==Signs and symptoms==
In the absence of congenital heart defects, individuals with &quot;situs inversus&quot; are homeostatically normal, and can live standard healthy lives, without any complications related to their medical condition. There is a 5–10% prevalence of congenital heart disease in individuals with &quot;situs inversus totalis&quot;, most commonly transposition of the great vessels. The incidence of congenital heart disease is 95% in &quot;situs inversus&quot; with levocardia.

Many people with &quot;situs inversus totalis&quot; are unaware of their unusual anatomy until they seek medical attention for an unrelated condition, such as a rib fracture or a bout of appendicitis. The condition may also be discovered during the administration of certain medicines or during tests such as a barium meal or enema. The reversal of the organs may then lead to some confusion, as many signs and symptoms will be on the atypical side. For example, if an individual with &quot;situs inversus&quot; develops appendicitis, they will present to the physician with lower left abdominal pain, since that is where their appendix lies. Thus, in the event of a medical problem, the knowledge that the individual has &quot;situs inversus&quot; can expedite diagnosis. People with this rare condition should inform their doctors before an examination, so the doctor can redirect their search for heart sounds and other signs. Wearing a medical identification tag can help inform health care providers in the event the person is unable to communicate.

&quot;Situs inversus&quot; also complicates organ transplantation operations as donor organs will more likely come from &quot;situs solitus&quot; (normal) donors. As hearts and livers are chiral, geometric problems arise placing an organ into a cavity shaped in the mirror image. For example, a person who requires a heart transplant needs all their great vessels reattached to the donor heart. However, the orientation of these vessels in a person with &quot;situs inversus&quot; is reversed, necessitating steps so that the blood vessels join properly.

==Cause==
 

&quot;Situs inversus&quot; is generally an autosomal recessive genetic condition, although it can be X-linked or found in identical &quot;mirror image&quot; twins.

About 25% of individuals with &quot;situs inversus&quot; have an underlying condition known as primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). PCD is a dysfunction of the cilia that occurs during early embryonic development. Normally functioning cilia determine the position of the internal organs during early development, and so embryos with PCD have a 50% chance of developing &quot;situs inversus&quot;. If they do, they are said to have Kartagener syndrome, characterized by the triad of &quot;situs inversus&quot;, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Cilia are also responsible for clearing mucus from the lung, and the dysfunction causes increased susceptibility to lung infections. Kartagener syndrome can also manifest with male infertility as functional cilia are required for proper sperm flagella function.

A marked increase in cases was observed several months after the lifting of the zero-COVID-19 policy in China, which coincided with a rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections. This rare clinical evidence suggests a possible link between infection during pregnancy and the development of situs inversus in the fetus, specifically during gestational weeks 4–6, the critical period for organ positioning.

==Effect on anatomy==

The condition affects all major structures within the thorax and abdomen. Generally, the organs are simply transposed through the sagittal plane. The heart is located on the right side of the thorax, the stomach and spleen on the right side of the abdomen and the liver and gall bladder on the left side. The heart&#x27;s normal right atrium occurs on the left, and the left atrium is on the right. The lung anatomy is reversed and the left lung has three lobes while the right lung has two lobes. The intestines and other internal structures are also reversed from the normal, and the blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatics are also transposed.

If the heart is swapped to the right side of the thorax, it is known as &quot;&quot;situs inversus&quot; with dextrocardia&quot; or &quot;&quot;situs inversus totalis&quot;. If the heart remains on the normal left side of the thorax, a much rarer condition (1 in 2,000,000 of the general population), it is known as &quot;situs inversus&quot; with levocardia&quot; or &quot;situs inversus incompletus&quot;.

&quot;Situs inversus&quot; of the optic disc may occur unilaterally or bilaterally, associated with reduced binocularity and stereoacuity resembling monofixation syndrome. It is characterized by emergence of the retinal vessels in an anomalous direction (from the nasal rather than the temporal aspect) with dysversion (tilt) of the optic disc.

&quot;Situs inversus&quot; does not appear to significantly affect rates of handedness. Based on a 2004 study documenting &quot;situs inversus&quot; in individuals with primary ciliary dyskinesia, the proportion of right-handedness among those with situs inversus did not differ significantly from that of those with &quot;situs solitus&quot;. A more recent 2023 study failed to find statistically significant differences in cognition, albeit left-handedness was significantly more common at 26% compared to the 10.6% of general population.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of &quot;situs inversus&quot; can be made using imaging techniques such as x-ray, ultrasound, CT scan, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Any potential treatment would involve a complete and highly invasive surgical rearrangement of the internal viscera of the patient. Such a procedure is unnecessary, given that &quot;situs inversus&quot; rarely causes any additional symptoms. No treatment, medical or surgical, is prescribed for &quot;situs inversus&quot; individuals, with medical professionals instead treating any other symptoms the patient may have with awareness of the unique anatomy of the patient.

== Occurrence ==
&quot;Situs inversus&quot; is rare, affecting 0.01% of the population.

==History==
Dextrocardia (the heart being located on the right side of the thorax) was seen and drawn by Leonardo da Vinci, and then recognised by Marco Aurelio Severino in 1643. &quot;Situs inversus&quot; was first described more than a century later by Matthew Baillie.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;situs inversus&quot; is a short form of the Latin phrase &quot;situs inversus viscerum&quot;, meaning &quot;inverted position of the internal organs&quot;.

==Notable cases==
Notable individuals with documented cases of situs inversus include:
* Enrique Iglesias, a Spanish singer, songwriter, actor and record producer.
* Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Canadian-American actress, writer, and comedian.
* Randy Foye, an American basketball player in the NBA. He has suffered no discernible complications, and the condition is not expected to affect his career as a professional athlete, as all his organs are in reverse.
* Ginggaew Lorsoungnern, a Thai convict executed by firing squad. Her condition was discovered after she was shot in the left side of her chest and survived. After waking up in the morgue she was taken back and executed.
* Tim Miller, director of the Ashtanga Yoga Center in Carlsbad, California.
* Rose Marie Bentley, a Molalla, Oregon woman who unknowingly had the rare variant &quot;situs inversus&quot; with levocardia, and lived to 99 years without any complications. She donated her body to Oregon Health &amp; Science University, where her condition was discovered during an anatomy class after students noticed the unusual arrangement of her heart&#x27;s blood vessels, prompting further investigation of the cadaver.

<doc id="626864" wikidata="Q1137869" url="?curid=626864" title="Xalam">
<text>Xalam (in Serer, khalam in Wolof, and Mɔɣlo in Dagbanli) is a traditional lute from West Africa with 1 to 5 strings. The xalam is commonly played in Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Niger, Northern Nigeria, Northern Ghana, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, and Western Sahara. The xalam and its variants are known by various names in other languages, including bappe, diassare, hoddu (Pulaar), koliko (Gurunsi), kologo (Frafra), komsa, kontigi, gurmi, garaya (Hausa), koni, konting (Mandinka), molo (Songhay/Zarma), ndere, ngoni (Bambara), and tidinit (Hassaniyya and Berber).

In Wolof, a person who plays the xalam is called a &quot;xalamkat&quot; (a word composed of the verbal form of xalam, meaning &quot;to play the xalam&quot;, and the agentive suffix &quot;-kat&quot;, thus meaning &quot;one who xalams&quot;).
In Mande, this is &quot;ngonifola&quot; or &quot;konting fola&quot;.
In Hausa, this is &quot;mai gurmi&quot; or &quot;mai kontigi&quot;.

==Construction and tuning==

The xalam, in its standard form, is a simple lute chordophone with one to five strings. The wooden body (soundbox) membranophone of the instrument is oval-shaped and covered with the hide of cattle. The strings of the xalam are typically made of two or three tightly wound strands of low-gauge nylon fishing line; these strings are fixed to the instrument&#x27;s wooden neck by long and narrow leather strips and to its wooden bridge by cotton strings. By moving these strips, the instrument&#x27;s tune can be adjusted. The xalam usually has two main melody strings that are fingered by the left hand (like the strings of a guitar or banjo) and two to three supplementary strings of fixed pitch. Most xalam players construct their own xalams, although they usually call on woodworkers (lawbe) to carve the body, neck, and bridge for them.

In most Wolof-speaking parts of Senegal, the xalam has three principal tunings, all of which involve tuning the two main strings a perfect fourth apart. In the first tuning (&quot;ci suuf&quot; or low), the main strings are tuned 1 and 4 ( 1 being the fundamental of a major scale), with three supplementary strings being tuned an octave higher to 1´, 2´, and 3´. The second tuning (&quot;ci kow&quot; or high) uses the same string intervals but the fundamental is placed a minor second above the higher melody string, meaning that the open main strings now play the role of 3 and 6, with the supplementary strings acting as 3´ and 4#, the highest supplementary string usually being ignored. In the third tuning (&quot;ardin&quot;), the fundamental is a minor third above the lowest main string and the main strings are tuned 6 and 2, with supplementary strings tuned to 5 and 1´. The third supplementary string is either ignored or is tuned to 6 or 2´. If playing in an ensemble, the &quot;ardin&quot; xalam&#x27;s main strings are tuned a minor third below the &quot;cu suuf&quot; xalam, and the &quot;ci kow&quot; xalam is tuned a major third above the &quot;ci suuf&quot; xalam to ensure that the fundamentals of each xalam coincide. (Thus, if the &quot;ci suuf&quot; xalam&#x27;s lowest note were C, the ardins lowest note would be a low A and the &quot;ci kow&quot; xalam&#x27;s lowest note would be E.)

==Players==

In most areas the xalam is played by male griots, or praise singers who are born into the profession. It most often acts as a solo or duo instrument to accompany praise songs and historical recitations, and in some areas it may form part of a larger group including kora, drums, and calabashes. It is traditionally heard at weddings, infant naming ceremonies, and (always with amplification) is now a common member of folklore ensembles, popular &quot;mbalax&quot; groups, and &quot;ndaga&quot; variety shows.

<text>A test pilot is an aircraft pilot with additional training to fly and evaluate experimental, newly produced and modified aircraft with specific maneuvers, known as flight test techniques.

==History==
Test flying as a systematic activity started during the First World War, at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in the United Kingdom. 
An &quot;Experimental Flight&quot; was formed at the Central Flying School.
During the 1920s, test flying was further developed by the RAE in the UK, and by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) in the United States. In the 1950s, NACA was transformed into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or NASA. During these years, as work was done into aircraft stability and handling qualities, test flying evolved towards a more qualitative scientific profession. In the 1950s, test pilots were being killed at the rate of about one a week, but the risks have shrunk to a fraction of that because of the maturation of aircraft technology, better ground-testing and simulation of aircraft performance, fly-by-wire technology and, lately, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to test experimental aircraft features. Still, piloting experimental aircraft remains more dangerous than most other types of flying.

At the insistence of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the first American astronauts, the Mercury Seven, were all military test pilots, as were some of the later astronauts.

The world&#x27;s oldest test pilot school is what is now called the Empire Test Pilots&#x27; School (motto &quot;Learn to Test – Test to Learn&quot;), at RAF Boscombe Down in the UK. There are a number of similar establishments over the world. In America, the United States Air Force Test Pilot School is located at Edwards Air Force Base, the United States Naval Test Pilot School is located at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland and EPNER (&quot;Ecole du Personnel Navigant d&#x27;Essai et de Reception&quot; – &quot;School for flight test and acceptance personnel&quot;), the French test pilot school, is located in Istres, France. There are only two civilian schools; the International Test Pilots School in London, Ontario, and the National Test Pilot School, a not-for-profit educational institute is in Mojave, California. In Russia, there is a Russian aviation industry Fedotov Test Pilot School (founded 1947) located in Zhukovsky within the Gromov Flight Research Institute.

==Qualifications==
*Understand a test plan
*Stick to a test plan by flying a plane in a highly specific way
*Carefully document the results of each test
*Have an excellent feel for the aircraft and sense exactly how it is behaving oddly if it is doing so
*Solve problems quickly if anything goes wrong with the aircraft during a test
*Cope with many different things going wrong at once
*Effectively communicate flight test observations to engineers and relate engineering results to the pilot community, thus bridging the gap between those who design and build aircraft with those who employ the aircraft to accomplish a mission
*Have an excellent knowledge of aeronautical engineering to understand how and why planes are tested.
*Be above-average pilots with excellent analytical skills and the ability to fly accurately while they follow a flight plan.

Test pilots can be experimental and engineering test pilots (investigating the characteristics of new types of aircraft during development) or production test pilots (the more mundane role of confirming the characteristics of new aircraft as they come off the production line). Many test pilots would perform both roles during their careers. Modern test pilots often receive formal training from highly-selective military test pilot schools, but other test pilots receive training and experience from civilian institutions and/or manufacturers&#x27; test pilot development programs (see list of test pilot schools).

<text>Delgatie Castle is a castle near Turriff, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

A castle has stood on the site of Delgatie Castle since the year 1030 AD, although the earliest parts of the castle standing today were built between 1570 and 1579. Additional wings and a chapel were added in 1743.

The castle was stripped from the disgraced Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Buchan, after the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and given to Clan Hay (later to become the Earls of Erroll). Mary, Queen of Scots, was a guest at the castle in 1562 after the Battle of Corrichie.

Architecturally, the castle consists of a keep, adjoining house and two later wings. Notable features include a very wide turnpike stair and painted ceilings dating from the 16th century in two of the rooms, one dating from 1592, and the other from 1597. In many places may be seen the Hay family arms including the three cattle yokes which recall a farmer and his two sons who were instrumental in the defeat of a Danish raiding party at Cruden Bay. (See Clan Hay for more detail.)

Today, the castle and its gardens are owned by the Delgatie Castle Trust. The castle, grounds and café are open to the public throughout the summer months and suites within the castle itself and a number of cottages on the estate are available to rent. There is also a popular fishing site on the river passing through.

<doc id="626876" wikidata="Q2658343" url="?curid=626876" title="Charn">
<text>Charn is a fictional city appearing in the 1955 book &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;, the sixth book published in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, written as a prequel to &quot;The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot;. Charn, and the world of which it is the capital city, are the birthplace of Jadis, also known as the White Witch, who later seizes control of Narnia.

When visited briefly by Digory and Polly, the protagonists of the novel, the city is totally deserted, lifeless, and crumbling under a dying sun in a dark blue sky. However, according to Jadis, the sun had been that way for eons, but the sky was likely light blue. Rivers have dried up, and neither weeds nor insects live. All life in the world of Charn had been destroyed by Jadis through an evil magic spell known as the Deplorable Word. In the novel, the city stands as an example of the dead end that can result if a civilization succumbs to evil.

During their visit, Digory accidentally wakes Jadis from suspended animation, and she is able to leave the world with them.

==History==
According to Jadis, Charn was once the greatest city of her unnamed world, &quot;the wonder of the world, perhaps of all worlds.&quot; It was a magnificent civilization ruled by a line of magically adept emperors and empresses, of whom Jadis was the last. However, by the time the protagonists enter, the world is now a cold and desolate wasteland with no life to be seen anywhere, and the city is on the brink of collapse.

Magic may have been widely used in Charn; Jadis referred to the common use of magic carpets for transportation. Their use was apparently limited to the nobility, who inherited inborn magical powers. Jadis disdained Andrew Ketterley, Digory&#x27;s magician uncle, as a petty conjurer without a drop of real magic blood in his veins, saying, &quot;Your kind was made an end of in my world a thousand years ago.&quot;

Apparently dragons were also once abundant in Charn and in the service of the royal and noble families.

The Hall of Images displays the regal history of Charn, showcasing lifelike portraits of past rulers who are depicted as tall, beautiful, and powerful figures seated upon their thrones. The sequence of these images, through the expressions on their faces, tells a story of a civilization that was once benevolent but degenerated into a cruel, tyrannical empire. The early Emperors and Empresses of Charn were kind and wise, but over centuries, for unexplained reasons, their lineage devolved into one of malevolence, corruption, evil, and despair, seeing their subjects only as a means to an end. Evidently, their hunger for power was insatiable and they conquered several other realms, as Jadis gloats that &quot;many great kings&quot; attempted to stand against Charn, but were defeated and their names lost to history. Slavery was once common in Charn, as was human sacrifice. The last queen of Charn was Jadis, although the numerous empty thrones after hers suggest a premature end to the dynasty.

As Jadis leads the children through the decaying palace, she describes the cruelty of Charn and its leaders. She points out dungeons and torture chambers to them and recounts that her great-grandfather once invited seven hundred nobles to a banquet and slaughtered them all, &quot;before they had drunk their fill,&quot; for &quot;they had rebellious thoughts.&quot;

When the children finally see the full extent of the city from the balcony of the royal palace, it extends as far as the eye can see in any direction, as if covering the entire world. It is described as being full of pyramids, bridges, palaces, and towers, with a great river that had long since turned to dust. Jadis recalls viewing the city while it was full of life: &quot;It is silent now. But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the noises of Charn; the trampling of feet, the creaking of wheels, the cracking of the whips and the groaning of slaves, the thunder of chariots, and the sacrificial drums beating in the temples. I have stood here (but that was near the end) when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of Charn ran red.&quot;

==The destruction of Charn==
Jadis was responsible for the eradication of all life on Charn but blamed the destruction on her sister. Jadis and her sister fought a civil war for the throne, which Jadis eventually lost. She claimed she had offered to spare her sister&#x27;s life if she surrendered, so the resulting destruction was the unnamed sister&#x27;s fault. Jadis obliterated her kingdom and all its people rather than relinquishing her power over them.

According to Jadis&#x27;s own account, her sister had started a long and murderous civil war. There was a solemn oath between her and the unnamed sister that neither side would use magic, a pact broken by the sister, who gained the advantage as a result. Jadis recounts that during the civil war, she &quot;poured out the blood of her armies like water,&quot; but was eventually defeated. In the final battle, which was fought in the city itself over three days, the sister defeated the last of Jadis&#x27; forces.

Within the ruling family of Charn, there was knowledge of an evil spell, the &quot;Deplorable Word&quot;, which would destroy all life except the one who spoke it, though the word itself was a mystery. Although her ancestors had bound themselves and their descendants with oaths never to seek knowledge of this spell, Jadis had sought it out and learned the word &quot;in a secret place and paid a terrible price to learn it.&quot; Her sister knew Jadis had discovered the Deplorable Word but did not think Jadis would use it. Facing defeat, Jadis spoke the Deplorable Word, which annihilated all life under the sun apart from herself.

After this, she put herself into an enchanted sleep in the Hall of Images. During her suspended animation, all water in Charn dried up and the once-magnificent city crumbled into ruin.

==The waking of Jadis==
The spell that bound Jadis was broken by Digory Kirke. He and Polly Plummer had arrived on Charn via the Wood between the Worlds, and they had explored the deserted royal palace. In the room where Jadis slumbered with life-sized images of her royal ancestors, Kirke succumbed to temptation after having read a verse:

Make your choice, adventurous Stranger;Strike the bell and bide the danger,Or wonder, till it drives you mad,What would have followed if you had.

Charn&#x27;s star is described as red, large, and cold. When Digory asks Jadis about the star&#x27;s appearance, she asks him about his world&#x27;s Sun. When informed that the Sun is yellow, brighter, smaller, and &quot;gives off a good deal more heat,&quot; she remarks with sudden interest, &quot;Ah, so yours is a younger world.&quot;

Charn and the realm in which it resided ceased to exist entirely after Jadis and the children left. Later, when Aslan and the children are in the Wood between the Worlds, Aslan shows them that the puddle leading to Charn is dried up, as the empty world has been destroyed. Jadis entered Narnia with the humans from Earth, and 900 years later appears as the White Witch in &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, ruling that land for 100 years until Aslan returned and defeated her with the aid of the four Pevensie children.

==Commentary==
The name &quot;Charn&quot; suggests &quot;charnel house,&quot; a repository for human skeletal remains. The hall of the figures of the rulers of Charn, inspired by the underground grotto of mummies in King Solomon&#x27;s Mines, shows a progression illustrating the decline and fall of the city and its world, reflecting a view of history described by G. K. Chesterton. The &quot;deplorable word&quot; is most likely a metaphor for weapons of mass destruction, which many feared would bring about the destruction of the world at the time when the novel was written.

In the last chapter of the book, Polly asks Aslan if humanity has yet grown as corrupt as Charn, to which he replies:

In this paragraph, Lewis may have been alluding to the tyranny, despotism, and corruption, including Communism, which had been spreading abroad. Aslan&#x27;s statement that before the protagonists grow old, their world, which is our world, &quot;will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than Empress Jadis&quot;, might be a reference to World War I and World War II. This is further suggested by the fact that &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, which is set during World War II, portrays Digory as the elderly Professor Kirke.

<text>Mount Smart Stadium, branded as Go Media Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in Auckland, New Zealand. It is the main home ground of the New Zealand Warriors of the National Rugby League and Auckland FC of the A-League Men, and occasionally hosts rugby union and international rugby league matches. Built within the quarried remnants of the Rarotonga / Mount Smart volcanic cone, it is located 10 kilometres south of the city centre, in the suburb of Penrose.

==History==

The Mount Smart Domain Board was established in 1943 with the purpose of transforming the former quarry site into a public reserve. In 1953, a plan was approved for a sports stadium which was officially opened in 1967. In 1978, it hosted 3 matches of the World Series Cricket tour of New Zealand. The stadium hosted track and field events including the highly successful Pan Am series during the early 1980s.

During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour the Auckland rugby league team defeated the tourists 30–14 at Mt Smart before a crowd of 8,000. Mount Smart hosted its first rugby league international on 23 July 1989 when New Zealand and Australia played the third test of the Kangaroos 1989 New Zealand Tour. In front of 15,000 fans, Australia defeated the Kiwis 22–14 to wrap up the series 3–0.

The stadium was chosen as the Main Athletics Stadium as well as the opening and closing ceremonies venue of the 1990 Commonwealth Games. It was where the New Zealand men&#x27;s national football team (the All Whites) played all their home qualifying games for the 1982 FIFA World Cup. This was the first occasion that New Zealand had qualified for a FIFA World Cup and the event captured the imagination of the nation with large crowds packing the stadium.

Adele holds the attendance record of the stadium, with 45,000 fans, who saw her play at Adele Live 2017. Ericsson Stadium was the host of the Super League&#x27;s 1997 World Club Championship Final between Australian teams the Brisbane Broncos and Hunter Mariners. In front of 12,000 fans, the Broncos defeated the Mariners 36–12. Ericsson Stadium hosted three-quarters of the 1999 Rugby League Tri-nations&#x27; games, including the final, which New Zealand lost 20–22.

The stadium is now owned by the Auckland Council, following the merger of Auckland&#x27;s regional authorities and managed by Auckland Stadiums. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the back of the grandstand roof at Mount Smart was used for Bungee jumping. Following the first rugby league test at the stadium in 1989, Australian captain Wally Lewis and teammate Peter Jackson both &#x27;took the plunge&#x27;.

Mount Smart Stadium also hosted the first standalone NRL Women&#x27;s Premiership match between the New Zealand Warriors and St. George Illawarra Dragons on 22 September 2019. The Dragons won this match 26–6.

==Naming rights==

As of 12 July 2006, the stadium reverted to its original name, Mt Smart Stadium. In a press release, the Auckland Regional Council, owners of the stadium, stated they had considered other offers, but felt they did not suit. Auckland Regional Council did not actively pursue a replacement sponsor.

On 14 July 2017 the Stadium was temporarily renamed Manu Vatuvei Stadium for the Warriors vs Panthers game where the Warriors bid farewell to club legend Manu Vatuvei.

On 15 May 2023, the stadium became known as Go Media Stadium when Auckland Stadiums signed a naming rights deal with the advertising company. On 10 July 2024, the naming rights deal was extended until at least May 2028.

On 18 August 2023, the stadium was renamed Daniel Anderson Stadium for one day only as a fundraiser for former NZ Warriors coach Daniel Anderson who became an incomplete quadriplegic after a bodysurfing accident in 2022.

On 19 August, 2024, the stadium was renamed Shaun Johnson Stadium for one week to commemorate the final home game of Shaun Johnson&#x27;s career on 23 August, 2024 before his retirement after the season.

==Tenants==
It currently serves as the home ground for the New Zealand Warriors in the Australian National Rugby League and NRL Women&#x27;s Premiership. It is the former home of the Football Kingz of the Australian National Soccer League; however, its A-League successor, the now defunct New Zealand Knights, played on the other side of Waitematā Harbour at North Harbour Stadium.

The Moana Pasifika Super Rugby team started utilising the stadium as its home ground in 2022.

The Athletics Ground (officially Mt Smart Stadium Number 2) hosts athletics meets. It also holds local rugby league matches and serves as the home ground for the Auckland franchise in the Bartercard Premiership.

In March 2024, new A-League Men club Auckland FC was announced to be playing their first season at this venue. In July 2024, it was announced that the club had signed a five-year deal meaning the stadium would be Auckland FC&#x27;s home until at least 2029.

== Concerts ==
The capacity of the stadium for concerts is roughly 47,000 people. This can be expanded to 60,000 when the temporary north and south stands are installed.

Mount Smart Stadium was the Auckland venue of the Big Day Out music festival until 2012. In 2014, Western Springs Stadium served as the venue for the festival in Auckland. Among the concerts hosted were Rainbow Warrior Benefit Concert (Greenpeace 1986) featuring multiple artists including Neil Young on acoustic guitar and Jackson Browne, Graham Nash, Topp Twins, Dave Dobbyn and a Split Enz reunion within Mt Smart Stadium.

An album of Maori artists who came to support the aims of the Mt. Smart Stadium project was released in 1981. It was called &quot;The Mauri Hikitia&quot;. It reached no 4 on the New Zealand charts. It featured Rhonda, Ken Kincaid, Deane Waretini, and the Lightwood family.

Michael Jackson performed twice at the stadium, on November 9 and 11, 1996 during his HIStory World Tour. The combined attendance for both shows was 86,000.

<text>The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual (CCDM) is one of the most widely recognized reference volumes on the topic of infectious diseases. It is useful for physicians, epidemiologists, global travelers, emergency volunteers and all who have dealt with or might have to deal with public health issues.

The title of the book, as registered in the Library of Congress, is &quot;Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 20th edition, An Official Report of the American Public Health Association.&quot; The editor of CCDM is David L. Heymann, MD.
==History==
The first edition, published in 1917 by the US Public Health Service, titled Control of Communicable Diseases. The first edition was a 30-page booklet with 38 diseases (Public Health Reports 32:41:1706-1733), adopted from a pamphlet written by Dr. Francis Curtis, health officer for Newton, Massachusetts, and sold for 5¢. Changes over the years reflect the new discoveries of infectious agents over the past century. The second edition in 1926 included 42 diseases, but only two arthropod (usually mosquito) - borne diseases, yellow and dengue fever and one protozoan disease, malaria. The causative organism of smallpox, dengue and chickenpox was listed as &#x27;unknown.&#x27; The third edition in 1932 included two new arthropod infestations and a new disease, coccidioidal granuloma, with a note that it was 100% fatal. Eight diseases were listed as &quot;reportable&quot;: diphtheria, epidemic influenza, measles, meningococcal meningitis, polio, scarlet fever, smallpox, and typhoid fever. The fourth edition in 1935 included 13 new infections. The fifth edition erroneously listed pemphigus as being infectious. In the sixth edition the rickettsioses were reorganized. In the seventh edition (1950) leprosy became Hansen&#x27;s disease and cat-scratch disease was added as a probable viral disease (now known to be caused by the bacterium, Bartonella henselae. The eighth edition (1955) erroneously listed actinomycosis as a fungal disease. In the ninth edition, arthropod-borne viral diseases were reclassified, with 49 additional diseases, resulting in substantially more viral entries. By the twelfth edition (1975) there were 118 arboviral illnesses. The 16th edition included &quot;neoplastic, malignant viral-associated diseases&quot; for the first time. In 2004 (18th edition) there were six &quot;tick-borne&quot; diseases, which was later corrected to include a &quot;mite-borne&quot; disease, rickettsialpox. The title was changed to &quot;Control of Communicable Disease Manual&quot; in 1995 (16th edition) to remove any perception of gender bias.
For a long time the paperback edition was a handy pocket book, the 17th edition still fitting in one hand or a pocket . Now, the softcover version can only fit in the largest pocket of a spacious winter coat. However, the entire contents are now available as an app for iOS and Android and in PDF format.

The paperback is 729 pages with dimensions of 1.5 x 4.2 x 7 inches. The ISBN is 978-0-87553-018-5.

The American Public Health Association published the 20th edition of the &quot;CCDM&quot; in 2014 under the editorship of David L. Heymann, MD. International infectious disease and public health experts, at both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, have updated this version.

The 20th edition includes two new chapters on noma and animal/human communicable diseases. New arboviral agents were added (Banna, Cache Valley, Iquitos, and the Me Tri virus, but the number of arboviruses and other pathogens also contracted, apparently to make the manual less encyclopedic. The previous edition had eleven new chapters on topics fundamental to a global public health landscape. Chapter topics include: risk management, public health security in a globalized world, international health regulations, reporting of communicable diseases, outbreak response in bioterrorism, communicable disease control in humanitarian emergencies and handling of infectious materials. Other new chapters offer guidance on disease control at mass gatherings, after natural disasters or in emergency situations.

==Content==

&quot;The Control of Communicable Diseases Manual&quot; (&quot;CCDM&quot;) compiles comprehensive scientific data about communicable diseases, which significantly contribute to mortality and morbidity around the world. The &quot;CCDM&quot; emphasizes the epidemiological aspects of communicable diseases and provides information about their identification, reporting, control and prevention.

===Disease Descriptions===

The &quot;CCDM&quot; lists diseases in alphabetical order and includes information on each disease using the following 12 sections:

# Clinical Features
# Causative agent(s)
# Diagnosis
# Occurrence
# Reservoir(s)
# Incubation period
# Transmission
# Risk groups
# Prevention
# Management of patient
# Management of contacts and the immediate environment
# Special considerations

The size of each section varies considerably. For instance, the occurrence section for smallpox is less than a line long, since this disease is officially present only in the freezers of laboratories at the CDC in the United States and the Vector Institute in Russia.

==Availability==

The book has been published in a number of languages, including Arabic, Catalan, French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, and Thai, a testament to its global audience.

The &quot;CCDM&quot; is available as an online PDF version and as apps for iOS and Android for $50.

<text>, also known as Conan, The Boy in Future, is a Japanese post-apocalyptic science fiction anime series. It is an adaptation of American science-fiction writer Alexander Key&#x27;s 1970 novel &quot;The Incredible Tide&quot;. It was broadcast for twenty-six episodes on NHK General TV between April and October 1978.

A spin-off series, Future Boy Conan II: Taiga Adventure aired for twenty-four episodes on TBS from October 1999 to April 2000.

==Story==
The story begins in July 2008, during a time when mankind is faced with the threat of extinction. A devastating war fought with ultra-magnetic weapons far greater than anything seen earlier brings about a post-apocalyptic world, resulting in several earthquakes and tsunamis. The Earth is thrown off its axis, its crust rocked by massive movements, and the continents are torn completely apart and sink deep below the sea.

An attempt by a group of people to flee to outer space failed, with their spaceships being forced back on Earth and crashing on a small desert and dry island. Although initially desperate, the survivors discover that the crash landing has opened a freshwater well, and gradually life returns to the island. The crew members of the spaceship gradually settle on what they call &#x27;Remnant Island&#x27; and they lead a simple and happy life as an extended family. A new baby, Conan, is eventually born within the community in October 2016.

Year after year the older survivors die off in their isolation and unaware of the sort of humanity beyond the small island, until the only people left are Conan and his adoptive grandfather. One day Conan finds on the beach a young girl named Lana, the first stranger and person of his own age whom he had ever known. Lana was raised on another surviving island called High Harbor, where a simple society has re-developed in close contact with the nature. She has ended up on Conan&#x27;s island while trying to escape from abduction by the crew of the Barracuda, a sailing ship from the leftover of the old world, Industria. Industria is in desperate need of energy, having barely managed to continue its highly industrialized economy through careful husbandry of a backup nuclear reactor, and devolving into a caste-based dystopia. The main resource of highly concentrated orbital-based solar power has become unavailable after the disappearance of Lana&#x27;s grandfather, Dr. Lao, who has gone into hiding after the war in order to avoid further military usage of his research: a power that could rebuild the world, but which was also the weapon that brought humanity to the brink of apocalypse during the last conflict.

Soon another crew from Industria manages to locate Lana. In the altercation, Conan&#x27;s grandfather is killed and the boy is initially abandoned alone on the now-desert island. He decides to take his chances with the unknown ocean on a simple raft, in order to try and save his new friend Lana. In his journey he first meets another young boy, Jimsy, who grew up in semi-feral status on yet another island, where the Barracuda makes regular trips in order to acquire plastic rubbish to be converted back into oil at the Industria facilities. The rubbish is mined by the impoverished and still war-traumatized local population, in exchange for simple trinkets, alcoholic beverages and surrogate cigarettes.

Conan and Jimsy soon begin to socialize and also decide to raid the ship, respectively to save Lana and to steal its goods. The attempt fails and they are punished and forced into labor by the captain. The group is eventually brought to Industria and separated and reunited again various times, as the situation on that island further degenerates due to further natural disasters and the deteriorating social fabric, turning more and more into a dictatorship under the Director. Over the course of the story, he is the only irredeemable figure, devoid of any scruples and ever greedy for power at any cost. All the other characters, including the minor ones, develop significantly in response to events and in particular after being exposed to the selfless example of Conan. A pure love story also develops with Lana. After multiple separations and various challenges, the group eventually locates Dr. Lao, restores access to solar power just in time to salvage another ship and evacuate Industria just before another cataclysmic earthquake, and finally destroys the super-weapon which the Director was trying to deploy in order to maintain his hegemony over High Harbour and all the other remaining lands. As the last legacy of the society responsible for the apocalypse dies off, nature continues its recovery process, new families are founded, and the younger, still innocent but now more mature Lana and Conan set sail to build a new world that keeps only the positive aspects of the past.

==Characters==
:
:Conan is a fearless 11-year-old boy who was born on Remnant Island and raised by all survivors of a failed escape attempt into space from the Great Disaster. Conan is very attuned to his rural, secluded lifestyle, where he has grown up mainly in the company of the oldest surviving crew member, his adoptive &#x27;grandfather&#x27;. Conan is inexperienced but very clever, immensely strong, an exceptional athlete and underwater swimmer and spear-fisher. Despite his lack of social exposure, he is gentle and able to quickly integrate among strangers. Deciding to rescue Lana in a self-constructed sailboat after his Grandfather&#x27;s killing and Lana&#x27;s subsequent capture, Conan meets new friends and acquaintances while becoming caught up in Lepka&#x27;s plots for Industria and High Harbor.
:
:Lana is a quiet, soft-spoken girl from High Harbor and the granddaughter of Dr. Lao, to whom she is very devoted. Lana, who is also 11 years old, is found by Conan as she washed up unconscious on the shore of Remnant Island. She is the first girl, or person altogether beside his grandfather, whom the boy has ever seen. His initial curiosity and infatuation gradually develop into deeper feelings and reciprocal desire to stay together, no matter risks and adversities. Lana appears to also have some telepathic connection with her grandfather Dr. Rao, and to some extent also with birds and in particular a tern named Tikki. As her affection for Conan grows, a similar empathic bond also begins to form with the boy.
:
:A semi-feral boy living alone on the first island Conan arrives at, Jimsy quickly becomes Conan&#x27;s first friend, helping him rescue Lana. Jimsy is a master hunter (with a particular preference for grilled frogs and lizards), proficient in hunting with his bow and able to compete with Conan in other athletic skills almost to a draw. He has a good but rather hedonistic and wild nature, which tends to place him in troubles as he attempts to steal food, liquor and surrogate cigarettes. Jimsy ends up spending most of his time with Dyce after Conan and Lana are separated from the party. Initially, Jimsy has a negative view on women, but he gradually forms a relationship with Tera at the end of the series.
:
:The head of administration of Industria, Lepka technically serves under the Industria High Committee, a group of benevolent but old and naive scientists. Over the course of the series he becomes increasingly tyrannical and eventually stages a coup to become the sole dictator of Industria. He is the primary antagonist, cruel even with his loyal accomplices and always greedy for power, even attempting to restore a war-time superweapon to rule over what remains of the world.
:
:The grandfather of Lana, and the scientist responsible for the development of solar power for both civil and wartime usage. Originally a member of Industria&#x27;s High Council, he defected after he learned of Lepka&#x27;s power-driven ambitions, and hid under the cover identity of a hard-handed salvaging crew captain named Patch. He believes that the people of Industria must be taught to discard their weapons and begin new lives in peace. For this reason he escaped, bringing with him the secret of how to access the last orbiting solar power station from pre-war times.
:
:The young assistant director of Industria&#x27;s Administration forces. As a young girl, she was her family&#x27;s only survivor when the final war broke out and the Earth was devastated; and as a result of that tragedy, she became a harsh, uncaring enforcer. She is tasked by Lepka to capture Lana, and eventually leads the invasion of Industria against High Harbor. However, as she encounters Conan, she is gradually swayed by his unwavering courage and sincerity, and eventually joins him and his friends in taking down Lepka.
:
:Dyce is a citizen of Industria, and the captain of the plastic-salvaging ship &quot;Barracuda&quot;. He was originally ordered to track down Dr. Briac Lao, Lana&#x27;s grandfather, and convey the girl to Industria, but ended up developing an affection for Lana, enabling her to escape to Remnant Island. Fed up with Lepka&#x27;s cruelty towards Lana, he eventually becomes one of Conan&#x27;s allies, helping to overthrow Industria&#x27;s regime in their exploits. He is a comically inept character, and often makes it out alive only by pure luck in his fights with Industria&#x27;s forces.
:
:The leader of an underground cell composed of Industria&#x27;s lower-class/slave citizenry. He is an old ally of Dr. Lao in the latter&#x27;s attempts to improve the lives of the city&#x27;s downtrodden people, and was repeatedly arrested and charged and even branded for rebellion. During one stint in prison, he and his compatriots are freed by Conan and in turn aid him and his friends in navigating the underground city beneath Industria&#x27;s Triangle Tower, which is riddled with secret passages only the resistance knows about.
:
:Orlo is the young, rebellious leader of a rogue gang based in the mountains of High Harbor, who tax whoever the gang catches crossing their territory. He originates from a village of herders on the other side of High Harbor island, but turned into a bullying outlaw after he found honest work to be unsatisfactory. He plots to become the leader of High Harbor, and thus cooperates with the Industrians when they invade the island, bringing down the villager&#x27;s defenses. However, when a tidal wave hits the island and the Industrians subsequently surrender, his plans are permanently dashed. In the end, he finds his place back among his fellow islanders.
:
:Orlo&#x27;s younger sister, about the same age as Conan and Jimsy, and the deputy leader of Orlo&#x27;s men. She and Jimsy quickly take a liking to each other, but their radically diverging views of life prevent them from reaching a common ground at first. During the Industrian invasion of High Harbor, she is rescued by Jimsy and Conan, which breaks down the barrier between them, and they become a couple.
:
:Conan&#x27;s adoptive and elderly grandfather, who raised him on Remnant Island. Originally part of a crew of people escaping from the largely destroyed Earth, their spaceship crashed back down, miraculously landing on Remnant Island, with all the members surviving, including Conan&#x27;s grandfather. With every other crew member dying soon after Conan&#x27;s birth, he was left to raise Conan alone for 11 years, taking him as his adopted Grandson. However, after being attacked by Industrian soldiers during Lana&#x27;s abduction, he dies from his injuries. In the later course of his adventures, however, Conan encounters an Industrian low-class citizen who bears a striking resemblance to Grandfather.
:Umasou (&quot;looks delicious&quot; in Japanese) is Jimsy&#x27;s pet piglet which he acquired after becoming a pig herder on High Harbor Island.
:
:One of Monsley&#x27;s subordinates.

==Production==
Spanning a total of 26 episodes, the series was produced by Nippon Animation and featured the directorial debut of Hayao Miyazaki, who also contributed to character designs and storyboards. Other future prominent anime creators like Isao Takahata (storyboards, directing) and Yoshiyuki Tomino (storyboards) also worked on the series.

Nippon Animation originally presented NHK with several proposals. At first a different story was favored, but eventually, &quot;The Incredible Tide&quot; novel was chosen.

There was a preparation time of three months for the layout. Six months passed between the start of the key animation work and the airing of the first episode. Although a stock of eight episodes was already produced by that time, the show still went behind schedule. According to Miyazaki it &quot;took [them] from ten days to two weeks to produce a single episode&quot; and that if &quot;NHK hadn&#x27;t inserted a special program in there as a padding, it probably would have turned into a real wreck of a series. If we hadn&#x27;t been working for NHK, we never could have pulled &quot;Conan&quot; off.&quot;

The staff was happy to work on a more upbeat story after &quot;3000 Leagues in Search of Mother&quot;.

In a 1983 interview with Yōkō Tomizawa from &quot;Animage&quot;, Miyazaki stated that he only worked on the show under the condition that he was allowed to change the story. He disliked the pessimistic world view of the original story, feeling it was a reflection of Alexander Key&#x27;s own fears and insecurities. He wanted a story aimed at children to be more optimistic, stating &quot;[e]ven if someone&#x27;s lost all hope for the future, I think it is incredibly stupid to go around stressing this to children. Emphasize it to adults if you have to, but there&#x27;s no need to do so to children. It would be better to simply not say anything at all.&quot;

Miyazaki further made an effort to distance himself from the notion of High Harbor representing North America and Industria representing the Soviet Union. In order to do this, he even considered making the setting more Japanese. For example, in his version of the story, the people of High Harbor would grow rice instead of wheat and eat using chopsticks. But this &quot;would have led to all sorts of other problems&quot;, so he eventually dropped the idea.

One scene of Jimsy smoking cigarettes was removed by NHK before the airing of the episode. Miyazaki admitted that he put &quot;way too much of [his] own feelings into episode eight&quot;, specifically the underwater &quot;kiss&quot; scene. He had grown fonder of Lana by episode 5 and 6 and &quot;realized that [the show] incorporated the exact same story line of a manga [he] had created back in [his] student days&quot; to the point where even the shots were arranged in the same way.

==Reception and legacy==
In a 1983 interview with Yōko Yomizawa, Hayao Miyazaki acknowledged that ratings for the show had not been very good, noting that episode 25 had received the highest rating at 14 percent.

In her 1999 book &quot;Hayao Miyazaki: Master of Japanese Animation&quot;, Helen McCarthy identifies &quot;Conan&quot; as a &quot;seminal&quot; work and recognizes themes and story elements in this production which Miyazaki would continue to explore throughout his career. McCarthy also notes continuity in the development of the characters and their plight throughout Miyazaki&#x27;s work. She sees Lana and Conan as precedents for his later heroines and characters, and mentions, among others, Sheeta&#x27;s rescue by Pazu, from Miyazaki&#x27;s 1986 animated feature film &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, as an example. In 2013, anime director Kenji Kamiyama, most known for the &quot;Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex&quot; series, cited the series among the 15 best anime of all time.

&quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; appears, renamed and redrawn to avoid copyright issues, in the anime series &quot;Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!&quot;, in which it is the foundation of the main character&#x27;s love of anime, central to the story.

<doc id="626897" wikidata="Q309592" url="?curid=626897" title="Greg Grunberg">
<text>Gregory Phillip Grunberg (born July 11, 1966) is an American film and television actor known for starring as Eric Weiss in the ABC series &quot;Alias&quot;, Matt Parkman in the NBC series &quot;Heroes&quot;, Temmin &quot;Snap&quot; Wexley in &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, and Phil in &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;. He has often appeared in works produced and directed by his childhood friend J. J. Abrams, such as &quot;Felicity&quot; as Sean Blumberg. He was a recurring cast member in the first two seasons of the Showtime American television drama series &quot;Masters of Sex&quot;.

==Early life==
Grunberg was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Sandy (&quot;née&quot; Klein) and Gerry Grunberg and had a Jewish upbringing. He attended University High School in West Los Angeles, class of 1984.

==Career==
Grunberg got his first credited role in Matt Stone and Trey Parker&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;BASEketball&quot;. From 1998 to 2002, he appeared as Sean Blumberg on &quot;Felicity&quot;. He appeared from 2001 to 2006 as Eric Weiss on &quot;Alias&quot;. He left that series as a regular to star on the NBC sitcom, &quot;Grand Union&quot;. Since 2003, Abrams had planned a series called &quot;The Catch&quot; about a bounty hunter, starring Grunberg in the lead role. Suggested for both the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons, the series was never produced; however, a pilot episode was shot.

Abrams also cast Grunberg in a brief role as a pilot for the 2004 series &quot;Lost&quot;. Grunberg returned for the first-season finale, but his scenes were cut for time and were instead included on the season 1 DVD set. He also appeared in a small role in &quot;&quot;, which Abrams directed.

Grunberg had a major role in the NBC TV show &quot;Heroes&quot; as telepathic police officer Matt Parkman. He was offered a part in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, which Abrams directed, but was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. In the final film, he voices Kirk&#x27;s stepfather in the opening sequence. Grunberg voices FBI agent Ethan Thomas in the video game &quot;&quot;.

Outside of acting, Grunberg is known as one of the creators of the Yowza!! Android and iPhone application, a GPS-aware coupon-referring program. The company was acquired in 2014 by Spindle, a mobile commerce solutions firm.

He also voices Ant-Man in the animated series &quot;The Super Hero Squad Show&quot;. Grunberg was featured on the May/June 2009 cover of &quot;Making Music&quot; magazine. On May 17, 2010, Grunberg announced that he would be joining the cast of &quot;Love Bites&quot;.

He took up a minor role in the 2011 neo-noir detective videogame &quot;L.A. Noire&quot;, in which he provided both voice and facial motion capture as murder suspect Hugo Moller. On November 7, 2011, he appeared as a guest star on an episode of the TV series &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; with former &quot;Heroes&quot; co-star Masi Oka. He also appeared as a special guest star on the March 14, 2012, episode of the TV series &quot;Psych&quot;.

In 2013, Grunberg appeared in one episode during the first season of the TV series &quot;Masters of Sex&quot; as the character Gene Moretti, a rich business man. The part was expanded in 2014 to 4 episodes during the second season.

In February 2016, Grunberg co-hosted a late night talk show with Kevin Smith titled &quot;Geeking Out&quot; on AMC.

Since 2019, Grunberg has been a recurring guest star on the syndicated game show &quot;25 Words or Less&quot;.

In 2021, he appeared as a guest star on an episode of &quot;9-1-1: Lone Star&quot; in the role of a father fighting for the life of his son, who suffers from epilepsy. This echoes Grunberg&#x27;s real life activism due to his own son&#x27;s epilepsy.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Grunberg married Elizabeth Dawn Wershow. They have three children, one of whom has epilepsy, which has inspired Grunberg to take an active role in raising awareness of the neurological disorder and raising funds for research.

He often organizes charity efforts to raise funds for the Pediatric Epilepsy Project in Los Angeles. In the past, this has included events such as an auction of guitars handpainted by celebrities such as Donald Trump, Pink and Grunberg&#x27;s &quot;Alias&quot; co-stars Jennifer Garner and Michael Vartan.

In March 2007, Grunberg served as the chair of the first National Walk for Epilepsy, presented by the Epilepsy Foundation.

In 2009, Grunberg launched Talk About It, a website dedicated to epilepsy education and awareness, featuring many of his co-stars and celebrity friends, including Garner, Larter, Pasdar, Ramamurthy, Ventimiglia, and Panettiere, as well as Zachary Quinto, Chris Pine, Drew Pinsky, Ron Rifkin, and John Mayer. The site features Grunberg interviewing top epilepsy experts on the need to talk more about epilepsy, and includes a section for people all over the world to talk about it.

Grunberg was a participant in the first-ever national television advertising campaign supporting donations to Jewish federations. The program featured &quot;film and television personalities celebrating their Jewish heritage and promoting charitable giving to the Jewish community&quot; and included Marlee Matlin, Joshua Malina, Kevin Weisman, and Jonathan Silverman. He made a tongue-in-cheek promotional video for Temple Judea Religious School lambasting boring Hebrew Religious schools.

<text>Nicolas de Grigny (baptized 8 September 1672 – November 30, 1703) was a French organist and composer. He died young and left behind a single collection of organ music, and an &quot;Ouverture&quot; for harpsichord.

==Life==

Nicolas de Grigny was born in Reims in the parish of Saint-Pierre-Le-Vieil. The exact date of his birth is unknown; he was baptized on September 8. He was born into a family of musicians: his father, his grandfather, and his uncle, Robert, were organists at the Reims Cathedral, the Basilica of St. Pierre and St. Hilaire, respectively. Few details about his life are known, nothing at all about his formative years. Between 1693 and 1695 he served as organist of the abbey church of Saint Denis, in Paris (where his brother André de Grigny was sub-prior). It was also during that period that Grigny studied with Nicolas Lebègue, who was by then one of the most famous French keyboard composers. In 1695 Grigny married Marie-Magdeleine de France, daughter of a Parisian merchant. Apparently he returned to his hometown soon afterwards: the record of the birth of his first son indicates that de Grigny was already in Reims in 1696. The couple went on to produce six more children.

By late 1697, Grigny was appointed titular organist of Notre-Dame de Reims (the exact date of the appointment is not known), the city&#x27;s famous cathedral in which French kings were crowned. In 1699 the composer published his &quot;Premier livre d&#x27;orgue [contenant une messe et les hymnes des principalles festes de l&#x27;année]&quot; in Paris. Grigny died prematurely in 1703, aged 31, shortly after accepting a job offer from Saint Symphorien, a parish church in Reims. His &quot;Livre d&#x27;orgue&quot; was reissued in 1711 through the efforts of his widow. The collection became known abroad: it was copied in 1713 by Johann Sebastian Bach, and later by Johann Gottfried Walther.

==Work==
Nicolas de Grigny&#x27;s only surviving music is a large volume of organ works, &quot;Premier livre d&#x27;orgue&quot; (Paris, 1699; second edition 1711). The second edition was the only one known until 1949, when the earlier print was discovered—a single surviving copy at Bibliothèque nationale de France. This was published by Christophe Ballard using the original plates prepared by Claude Roussel, its engraver, in 1699. The first modern edition, by Alexandre Guilmant, 1904, was based on the 1711 version.

Unlike many other French &quot;livres d&#x27;orgue&quot; of the time, Grigny&#x27;s publication contains no preface.
The collection is in two parts: the first is a mass setting, the second comprises settings of five hymns for the principal feasts of the church year: &quot;Veni Creator&quot; (5 versets), &quot;Pange lingua&quot; (3 versets), &quot;Verbum supernum&quot; (4 versets), &quot;Ave maris stella&quot; (4 versets) and &quot;A solus ortus&quot; (three versets). There are 42 pieces overall. The plan of the mass is as follows: 
* 5 Kyrie versets, 
* 9 Gloria versets, 
* an Offertory, 
* 2 Sanctus versets, 
* 1 Benedictus verset, 
* an &quot;Elévation&quot;, 
* 2 Agnus Dei versets, 
* a Communion, and
* an Ite Missa Est verset.

As specified by the &quot;Caeremoniale Parisiensis&quot; (1662), Grigny states the chant melodies in the first and last Kyrie, Gloria, and the first Sanctus and Agnus Dei. His publication is based on &quot;Cunctipotens genitor Deus&quot;. The collection also includes a &quot;Point d&#x27;orgue&quot;, a piece based on a long pedal point.

<doc id="626913" wikidata="Q2329269" url="?curid=626913" title="Adam (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>Adam is a fictional character in the fourth season of the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, serving as that season&#x27;s primary antagonists (or &quot;Big Bad&quot;). Introduced in the episode &quot;The I in Team,&quot; Adam is a cybernetic demonoid created from human, demon, and technological components by Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse), head of The Initiative—a military organization studying demon behavior. After gaining consciousness, Adam kills Walsh and escapes containment. He then sets in motion plans to stage a demon and human massacre; Adam hopes that, in the aftermath of the battle, he will be able use the carnage to create an army of undead demonoids like himself. The character is ultimately defeated by Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a Slayer with superhuman strength, and her friends in the season&#x27;s penultimate episode &quot;Primeval&quot;.

Adam was played by George Hertzberg, who series creator Joss Whedon tasked with finding the character&#x27;s &quot;stillness&quot;. In terms of thematic resonance and characterization, the character draws heavily from Mary Shelley’s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and the show uses the character to question the morality of scientific advancement, highlighting the tension between technology and humanity. As a monster that begins life by killing his creator, Adam also serves as a way for the show to question tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority. Critical reception to Adam has been largely mixed. Some commentators felt his subplot was confusing and unconvincing, whereas others enjoyed the concept and praised the make-up and special effects used to create the character.

==Character arc==

===Television appearances===
Adam makes his first appearance on the thirteenth episode of season 4, &quot;The I in Team&quot;. The first twelve episodes of the season establish the overarching themes, with increasing focus on the mysterious activities of the Initiative. Buffy and Willow begin attending college, an experience which overwhelms Buffy immediately as she finds herself far outside her comfort zone. In the season premiere, Buffy and Willow begin attending a challenging psychology class taught by Dr. Maggie Walsh (Lindsay Crouse). She also meets Dr. Walsh&#x27;s teaching assistant Riley Finn (Marc Blucas) and they become attracted to each other. Riley is in charge of a military commando organization that hunts vampires and demons, and captures them for research. It is not revealed to audiences that Dr. Walsh is the head of the research branch of Riley&#x27;s military organization, called the Initiative, until the seventh episode.

The Initiative&#x27;s goals are gradually made clearer. A recurring character since the second season is Spike (James Marsters), a mercenary vampire who has fought both against and with Buffy in the past, depending on what suits his interests. Recently wanting to kill Buffy, Spike is captured by the Initiative before he can get to her and implanted with a chip in his brain that causes intense pain if he tries to attack humans to feed on them, or even to fight them. Buffy begins enthusiastically training with the Initiative, spending more time with Riley, and trying to impress Dr. Walsh. At different times, Willow, Xander, and Giles caution Buffy that she does not know the Initiative&#x27;s true motives and there are questions about their mission that are unanswered. Buffy begins asking questions during &quot;The I in Team&quot;. After being sent after a Polgara demon, a being with a skewer in its arm, she wants to know why the demon must be captured alive and unharmed as she is used to killing demons. Her questions at first confound Dr. Walsh—who answers to no one—then cement Dr. Walsh&#x27;s decision to remove Buffy from the Initiative. After a botched attempt to kill Buffy, Dr. Walsh consoles herself by going into laboratory room 314, where she speaks to her pet project: Adam, who is laying on a table, apparently unconscious. Adam rises and impales Dr. Walsh with the skewer in his arm—the one taken off the Polgara demon. His first word is &quot;Mommy&quot;, which he says as Dr. Walsh falls to the floor, dead.

Riley, meanwhile, learns of Dr. Walsh&#x27;s death and his comrades Forrest (Leonard Roberts) and Graham (Bailey Chase) suspect Buffy to be her murderer. Extremely agitated and showing signs of drug withdrawal, he follows Buffy and demands to know the truth in &quot;Goodbye Iowa&quot;. None of them are aware of Adam until he re-emerges in the underground laboratories of the Initiative, killing Dr. Walsh&#x27;s assistant and another soldier. He tells Riley that he knows Dr. Walsh created them both, that she gave Riley chemicals to strengthen him, which makes them brothers. When Riley refuses to acknowledge their bond, Adam skewers Riley, and knocks Buffy across the room while Forrest and Graham are trying to enter the locked door. Adam leaves and the Initiative are tasked with hunting him down and killing him. When one of Sunnydale&#x27;s residents, Jonathan Levinson (Danny Strong), casts a spell making him the center of everyone&#x27;s attention in &quot;Superstar&quot;, Adam is the only character in town who realizes it is an illusion. He explains his insight by saying he is &quot;aware&quot;. His uniqueness has set him apart. Adam is interested in how the illusion will play out, however, and watches it unfold. During the illusion, Jonathan—temporarily a part of the Inititative—discovers Adam&#x27;s only weakness: a uranium power core source which, effectively, will never allow him to die.

Spike simultaneously discovers Adam to be communicating with the town&#x27;s demon underworld, asking for favors through a charisma he has over them. Adam promises if Spike can drive apart Buffy and Riley and their friends, he will remove Spike&#x27;s microchip. The plan to drive Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles apart works for a while; at their lowest, the four refuse to speak to each other, but each of them realizes in &quot;Primeval&quot; that they were manipulated by Spike and return, apologetic. They realize that Adam has been orchestrating the capture of the town&#x27;s vampires and demons so he can release them in the Initiative; the Initiative&#x27;s holding cells are becoming overcrowded and the soldiers spread very thin and overworked. The soldiers and demons will then proceed to kill each other. Adam intends to use the resulting carnage to create an army of monsters much like himself.

Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles realize they must work as one unit to defeat Adam. They are captured sneaking into the Initiative, but Adam trips the power, releasing all the demons and a fight breaks out all over the facility. Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles get themselves into a room adjacent to 314 as Willow starts to cast the spell to join them all temporarily. Riley distracts Adam&#x27;s demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam. However, Adam, after modulating his arm to dispense a minigun, is able to overpower her. Suddenly, the spell begins to work: to function as one unit, Willow becomes the spirit, Giles the mind, Xander the heart, and Buffy the hand, or strength, of their ensemble. They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam, telling him &quot;You could never hope to grasp the source of our power&quot;. Adam, alone but intrigued, shoots at them to no avail. Adam then shoots a missile, which is changed into doves, and his gun is reverted into his arm. They are able, through Buffy, to punch inside Adam&#x27;s chest, remove his uranium core, destroying him.

Adam&#x27;s most significant influence following his death is in the next episode &quot;Restless&quot;, where the cost of defeating Adam is made apparent. &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s fourth season was a first in the series in that the Scoobies&#x27; defeat of the Big Bad did not occur in a two-part grand season finale. &quot;Primeval&quot; is not the last episode of the season. Joss Whedon felt so strongly about the importance of the four core characters that he dedicated the finale to exploring their development. &quot;Restless&quot; opens with Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles arriving at Buffy&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house still brimming with the energy of the spell that bound them together in &quot;Primeval&quot;. Each of them falls asleep quickly, however, and their dreams are a pastiche of enigmatic episodes that both reveal much about each character, but also foreshadow what will occur in seasons to come. Their dreams also mirror their roles in the spell they performed to kill Adam. The magic they used to defeat the influence of science creates an inverse crisis, violating the series&#x27; set of laws. Both Riley and Adam, now only in human form, appear in Buffy&#x27;s dream. They are wearing business suits, sitting together at a glass conference table as Buffy walks into the room, telling her they are naming things—as Adam did in the Garden of Eden—and making plans to take over the world. Buffy asks Adam what his name was before he was a monster, but he cannot tell her. Adam appears once more in the series as one of the faces of the First Evil, the seventh season&#x27;s Big Bad, in &quot;Lessons&quot;.

===Graphic novel appearance===
According to the comic book series &quot;Haunted&quot;, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with protecting Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over the body of a vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.

==Development==

===Creation and casting===

Series writer David Fury cited graphic novel author Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Promethea&quot;—a story combining science fiction, mysticism, and a female superhero—as inspiration for the storyline, and another nod to &quot;Frankenstein&quot; as its original title was &quot;Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus&quot;. In addition, series creator, Joss Whedon has long been interested in science fiction. He wrote the script for the film &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), where an extraterrestrial creature is bred from a human and an alien in a laboratory, and went on to develop the space Western television series &quot;Firefly&quot;. &quot;Buffy&quot; uses both science and magic as narrative devices. According to author Andrew Aberdein, the series employs science in three ways: to demonstrate what contemporary science explains, to posit what science may be able to accomplish, and the dominance of supernatural forces over science. According to Aberdein, Adam, a &quot;kinematically redundant, bio-mechanical demonoid&quot;, is the series&#x27; deepest exploration of scientific potential. Series writer Doug Petrie states that Adam is the embodiment of the invasion of science in a world where magic is the most powerful force. The series relied on its own form of magic to explain Buffy&#x27;s superpowers and other supernatural occurrences up to the fourth season. Adam is &quot;what happens when people who believe in science use demons for military gain&quot;, according to Petrie. The result is that science &quot;gets its ass kicked&quot; by magic.

&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; had been very successful in its first three seasons on television, but some of the characters left the series and storylines ended, creating a need for an entire shift in location and mission. Buffy and the core group of friends who fight with her graduate from high school, while the school itself was blown up in the third-season finale. The fourth season, therefore, presents viewers with Buffy, her best friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Xander (Nicholas Brendon), and mentor Giles (Anthony Head) at a crossroads. Series creator Joss Whedon called it a &quot;strange, sort of schizophrenic season&quot; with a &quot;weird incoherence&quot;, but also stated that the episodes in the fourth season were among the series&#x27; best. The writers set out to explore the characters&#x27; trials as they discover more about themselves following the defining years of high school. Although they had been a cohesive group of friends in the first three seasons, situations arise in the fourth to separate them. The writers focused on each of the four core characters individually throughout the season to increase the impact of their finally coming back together in the penultimate episode, &quot;Primeval&quot;, when they merge their essences to form a super-Buffy in order to defeat Adam.

George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California graduate with experience in sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam&#x27;s monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being in the right place at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on &quot;Buffy&quot; start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, &quot;this is a guy we&#x27;re going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can&#x27;t just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [and] should scare us with his actions; but there&#x27;s also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they&#x27;re only doing what they know. Or what they&#x27;ve been programmed to do. These aren&#x27;t born creatures, these are creations.&quot;

===Make-up===
When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no idea what Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. &quot;Buffy&quot; used a company named Optic Nerve to build the materials to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam&#x27;s appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam&#x27;s appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg&#x27;s voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.

==Themes==

Buffy studies scholar Roz Kaveney states that estrangement from the self and others is the primary theme of the fourth season. To illustrate the absolute search for identity, the series writers created Adam, who is more truly alone than is anyone else. He is a creature assembled from a man, vampires, demons, and cutting edge cybernetic technology. Adam was not the first re-animated corpse to be presented in the series. &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot; in the second season also had a Frankenstein monster-like creation and &quot;Beauty and the Beasts&quot; in the third includes references to &quot;Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot;; both touch on the misuse or abuse of science. Adam is a clear reference to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, who in the novel &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1818) tells his creator that he is the &quot;Adam of your labours&quot;. Mary Shelley wrote the novel to highlight the problems progress, science, and industry create for humanity. Throughout the action, the monster constantly asks what he is and why he was created. Likewise, Adam escapes from 314 and makes his way out into the world, and much like Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, he finds a little boy and asks the boy who and what he (Adam) is, then murders and dissects him. Adam is a curious character, seeking the truth and pontificating on what he has learned, even if he gained the knowledge through heartless violence. Whedon wanted Adam to be inquisitive and introspective, directing George Hertzberg to &quot;find the stillness&quot; in the character. Roz Kaveney notes that Hertzberg&#x27;s &quot;flawed but impressive performance&quot; includes Adam&#x27;s interesting idiosyncrasy of pausing each time he speaks, as if he is creating meaning with his own words and must consider the implications of what he is saying. Author Nikki Stafford connects Adam&#x27;s need to learn about the world around him to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster: Adam must understand why other people are here and why he has emotions, a peculiarity of his creation as Dr. Walsh never encouraged others to question her. One Buffy studies writer draws comparisons between Dr. Walsh and Victor Frankenstein, both of whom build monsters out of body parts &quot;to compensate for human vulnerability&quot;. The moral of Shelley&#x27;s novel is that what science can accomplish is not necessarily what it should.

Questioning tradition and authority, specifically institutional authority, is a repeated theme on the show. Buffy was created to subvert the media trope of a young, petite girl who easily falls prey to a male monster. Resisting patriarchy is exhibited in Buffy&#x27;s opposing the first season&#x27;s Master (Mark Metcalf), the leader of a cult determined to cause the apocalypse, and again in the third season where exploring the issues of power and its abuse is a primary theme. Buffy opposes Sunnydale&#x27;s secretly evil Mayor (Harry Groener), who is planning to transform into a giant demon and feed on the graduating class of Sunnydale High School. The military-industrial complex is at the heart of the authority question in the show&#x27;s fourth season, again drawing comparisons to &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Where Frankenstein&#x27;s monster had no parental love, Adam has a &quot;design flaw&quot;. Unlike Frankenstein&#x27;s monster, who needs his creator to make him a mate, Adam supplants Dr. Walsh&#x27;s existence with technology, finding her unnecessary. Adam is the embodiment of the lack of moral guidance in pursuing scientific and technological advancement. He represents the cannibalistic nature of relentless and unchecked power, which always comes back to devour its source. &quot;Buffy&quot;, however, subverts Shelley&#x27;s novel in the way Adam is defeated. Both Frankenstein and the monster must suffer alone. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; itself is an inversion of the Romantic era ideal of a solitary hero who must endure struggles, by portraying the monster and its creator as isolated and miserable. Buffy, as the embodiment of the postfeminist Romantic hero, further subverts this because the source of her success, according to Anita Rose, is that she fights with friends. Only then is she able to defeat Adam.

==Reception==
Critical reception to Adam was largely mixed, with critics&#x27; opinions ranging from negative to positive. Nikki Stafford, in her book &quot;Bite Me!: The 10th Buffyversary Guide to the World of Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, was critical of Adam as well as the series doing several Frankenstein-inspired episodes so close together, noting that &quot;Some Assembly Required&quot; was aired &quot;just two seasons&quot; prior. Stafford called the entire ending sequence of &quot;Primeval&quot;, which featured the reanimated corpses of several minor characters as well as the death of Adam, &quot;stupid and disgusting&quot; and wrote that the scene was a main reason she was &quot;happily bidding adieu&quot; to the plot involving Adam and the Initiative. Jenna Busch, in her book &quot;Joss Whedon: The Complete Companion&quot;, called Adam &quot;one of &quot;Buffy&quot;&#x27;s least interesting Big Bads&quot; and argued that his story-arc involving the Initiative was &quot;rather unconvincing and somewhat off-putting&quot;.

Other reviews were more accepting of the character. Noel Murray from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he &quot;love[d] the idea of Adam&quot; but was having a hard time understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam&#x27;s existence, noting, &quot;Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and no one seems overly bothered by the fact that one of their leaders was building a monster.&quot; Murray, however, did conclude that the show&#x27;s writers and producers &quot;did a decent job of bringing [the plot involving Adam] to a conclusion&quot;. Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was &quot;always impressed with [Adam&#x27;s] costume/make-up&quot;. Furthermore, he was positively surprised that it &quot;took [him] a minute to recognize&quot; Adam&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Restless&quot; sans makeup.

<doc id="626914" wikidata="Q578245" url="?curid=626914" title="Will Keith Kellogg">
<text>Will Keith Kellogg (born William Keith Kellogg; April 7, 1860 – October 6, 1951) was an American industrialist in food manufacturing, who founded the Kellogg Company, which produces a wide variety of popular breakfast cereals. He was a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church and practiced vegetarianism as a dietary principle taught by his church. He also founded the Kellogg Arabian Ranch, which breeds Arabian horses. Kellogg was a philanthropist and started the Kellogg Foundation in 1934 with a $66-million donation.

==Early career==
As a young businessman, Kellogg started out selling brooms in his hometown of Battle Creek, Michigan. In December 1878, W.K. Kellogg was hired by George H. King at the urging of James Springer White, also known as Elder White, to help run his new broom factory in Dallas, Texas. W.K. returned home in November 1879 to help his brother John Harvey Kellogg manage the Battle Creek Sanitarium. The sanitarium, originally the Western Health Reform Institute, was part of a pioneering effort based on the health principles advocated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The Kellogg family are of paternal English descent which can be traced to three brothers Daniel, Joseph and Samuel, of Braintree, Essex, England, who emigrated to the Connecticut colony in the 17th century.

John Kellogg described the Sanitarium system as &quot;a composite physiologic method comprising hydrotherapy, phototherapy, thermotherapy, electrotherapy, mechanotherapy, dietetics, physical culture, cold-air cure, and health training&quot;.

The Kelloggs pioneered the process of making flaked cereal. Because of the commercial potential of the discovery, W.K. wanted it kept a secret. However, John allowed anyone in the sanitarium to observe the flaking process and one sanitarium guest, C. W. Post, copied the process to start his own company. That company became Post Cereals and, later, General Foods, the source of Post&#x27;s first million dollars. That upset W.K. to the extent that he left the sanitarium to create his own company.

==Kellogg cereals==
Together with his brother John, W.K. Kellogg promoted cereals, especially corn flakes (maize), as a healthy breakfast food. They started the Sanitas Food Company around 1897, focusing on the production of their whole-grain cereals. At the time, the standard breakfast for the well-off was eggs and meat, while the poor ate porridge, farina, gruel and other boiled grains. The brothers eventually argued over the addition of sugar to their product, with W.K. in favour of adding sugar and John opposed. In 1906, Will founded the &quot;Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company&quot;, which later became the Kellogg Company.

In 1930, he established the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, ultimately donating $66 million to it. His company was one of the first to put nutrition labels on foods. He also offered the first inside-the-box prize for children. Kellogg said, &quot;I will invest my money in people.&quot;

During the Great Depression, Kellogg directed his cereal plant to work four shifts, each lasting six hours. This gave more people in Battle Creek the opportunity to work during that time.

==Arabian horse breeder==

Kellogg had a longtime interest in Arabian horses. In 1925, he purchased for $250,000 in Pomona, California, to establish an Arabian horse ranch. Starting with breeding stock descended from the imports of Homer Davenport and W. R. Brown, Kellogg then looked to England, where he purchased a significant number of horses from the Crabbet Arabian Stud, making multiple importations during the 1920s. The Kellogg ranch became well known in southern California not only for its horse breeding program but also for its entertaining, weekly horse exhibitions, open to the public and frequently visited by assorted Hollywood celebrities. Among many other connections to Hollywood, the actor Rudolph Valentino borrowed the Kellogg stallion &quot;Jadaan&quot; for his 1926 movie &quot;Son of the Sheik&quot;, along with a Kellogg employee, Carl Raswan, who rode in certain scenes as Valentino&#x27;s stunt double.

In 1932, Kellogg donated the ranch, which had grown to , to the University of California. In 1933, the ranch obtained some of the horses sold in the dispersal of Brown&#x27;s Maynesboro stud.
During World War II, the ranch was taken over by the U.S. War Department and was known as the Pomona Quartermaster Depot (Remount).

In 1948, the ranch was transferred to the U.S. Department of Agriculture; and in 1949, the land was deeded to the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Later in 1949, title to the then ranch and horses was passed to the State of California, with the provision that the herd of Arabian horses must be maintained. The ranch became part of the Voorhis unit of what was then known as the California Polytechnic State College in Pomona. This became known as the Kellogg Campus, and in 1966, it was separated to form California State Polytechnic College, Kellogg-Voorhis.

The ranch was also the location of the W. K. Kellogg Airport (not to be confused with the airport of the same name in Battle Creek, Michigan). It operated from 1928 to 1932, and was then the largest privately owned airport in the country.

Some of Kellogg&#x27;s property near Battle Creek was donated to Michigan State College and is now the Kellogg Biological Station.

==Death==
Will Keith Kellogg died at the age of 91 in Battle Creek, Michigan, on October 6, 1951, of circulatory illness. He was buried there at Oak Hill Cemetery.

Kellogg outlived most of his children but was survived by two of them, Karl Hugh (d. 1955) and Elizabeth Ann (d. 1966), as well as grandsons Norman Williamson, Jr. (d. 2001) and Will Keith Kellogg II (d. 2005).

==Philanthropy==
The Kellogg Foundation quotes W.K. as follows:
It is my hope that the property that kind Providence has brought me may be helpful to many others, and that I may be found a faithful steward.
The philanthropy of W. K. Kellogg is recognized as instrumental to the founding of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) and Kellogg College, Oxford.

==In popular culture==

Kellogg appears in &quot;The Manual for Murder&quot; (February 18, 2019), episode 16 of season 12 of the Canadian television period drama Murdoch Mysteries. Kellogg is played by actor Todd Thomas Dark.

<doc id="626916" wikidata="Q645752" url="?curid=626916" title="Oliver Twist (1948 film)">
<text>Oliver Twist is a 1948 British film and the second of David Lean&#x27;s two film adaptations of Charles Dickens novels. Following his 1946 version of &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, Lean re-assembled much of the same team for his adaptation of Dickens&#x27; 1838 novel, including producers Ronald Neame and Anthony Havelock-Allan, cinematographer Guy Green, designer John Bryan and editor Jack Harris. Lean&#x27;s then-wife, Kay Walsh, who had collaborated on the screenplay for &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, played the role of Nancy. John Howard Davies was cast as Oliver, while Alec Guinness portrayed Fagin and Robert Newton played Bill Sykes (Bill Sikes in the novel).

In 1999, the British Film Institute placed it at 46th in its list of the top 100 British films. In 2005 it was named in the BFI list of the 50 films you should see by the age of 14.

== Plot ==
A young pregnant woman makes her way to a Workhouse in Mudfog where she gives birth to a baby boy and dies. The Beadle, Mr. Bumble names the boy ‘Oliver Twist.’ Years later, Oliver is brought back to the workhouse where he and the other boys are treated cruelly by Mr. Bumble and matron Widow Corney. When a group of boys draw straws, Oliver gets the shortest one and so has to ask for more gruel. As punishment, Bumble sends Oliver to work as an apprentice for undertaker, Mr. Sowerberry. However, when Sowerberry’s older apprentice, Noah Claypole, insults Oliver’s deceased mother, Oliver flies into a rampage and attacks Noah, earning lashes from Sowerberry. 

To escape the torture, Oliver travels a seven day journey to London, where he befriends the Artful Dodger, a young pickpocket who introduces him to Fagin, an elderly criminal who trains boys how to steal. Fagin is, in fact, working with a mysterious man known as Monks, Oliver’s half-brother, whose prime goal is to ensure Oliver becomes a criminal to lose an inheritance which favours the latter, left by Monks’ father. As part of Monks’ plan, Fagin sends Oliver out with Dodger to pick pockets. When Dodger and his friend, Charlie Bates, steal a handkerchief from Mr. Brownlow, Oliver is thought to be the thief and arrested. Learning of this, Fagin and his vicious associate, Bill Sykes, fearing that Oliver will “peach”, send Sykes’ lover, Nancy to the court, where the latter learns that Oliver has been found innocent and taken to live with Mr. Brownlow.

Meanwhile, Monks visits Bumble and the Widow Corney (now Bumble’s wife) and buys a locket belonging to Oliver’s mother; the only proof of Oliver’s identity. When Mr. Brownlow sends Oliver to return some books, Sykes and Nancy bring Oliver back to Fagin’s lair, though Nancy immediately regrets doing so when Fagin attacks Oliver for trying to escape. Sometime later, whilst at the Three Criples pub, Nancy overhears a conversation between Fagin and Monks and learns of the latter’s true intentions towards Oliver. Whilst Sykes takes Oliver out to commit a robbery, Fagin pays Dodger to spy on Nancy, who informs Mr. Brownlow about Monks’ plan, though keeps Fagin and Sykes&#x27; names out of it. Dodger reports to Fagin and Sykes, causing the latter to murder Nancy, believing her to have betrayed him. 

Nancy’s murder brings down the public onto Fagin, Monks and Sykes. Monks is questioned by Brownlow, who by now, realises that Oliver is indeed his grandson. Monks is forced to confess his evil plot against Oliver, causing the police to arrest him. Bumble and the Widow Corney are also fired from their jobs at the workhouse, for assisting in Monks’ scheme. Sykes is pursued by a mob and uses Oliver as a hostage. He is shot by a member of the mob, loses his footing and accidentally hangs himself. Oliver is rescued and returns to live with Brownlow, finally finding the family he sought.

== Antisemitism controversy ==

Although critically acclaimed, Alec Guinness&#x27;s portrayal of Fagin and his make-up was considered antisemitic by some as it was felt to perpetuate Jewish racial stereotypes. Guinness wore heavy make-up, including a large prosthetic nose, to make him look like the character as he appeared in George Cruikshank&#x27;s illustrations in the first edition of the novel. At the start of production, the Production Code Administration had advised David Lean to &quot;bear in mind the advisability of omitting from the portrayal of Fagin any elements or inference that would be offensive to any specific racial group or religion.&quot; 

Lean commissioned the make-up artist Stuart Freeborn to create Fagin&#x27;s features; Freeborn had suggested to David Lean that Fagin&#x27;s exaggerated profile should be toned down for fear of causing offence, but Lean rejected this idea. In a screen test featuring Guinness in toned-down make-up, Fagin was said to resemble Jesus Christ. On this basis, Lean decided to continue filming with a faithful reproduction of Cruikshank&#x27;s Fagin, pointing out that Fagin was not explicitly identified as Jewish in the screenplay.

When released in 1948, the film was criticized by American columnist Albert Deutsch, who had seen the film in London. Deutsch wrote that even Dickens &quot;&#x27;could not make Fagin half so horrible,&#x27; and warned that the film would fan the flames of anti-Semitism.&quot; The New York Board of Rabbis appealed to Eric Johnston, head of the Production Code Administration, to keep the film out of the U.S. Other Jewish groups also objected, and the Rank Organization announced in September 1948, that U.S. release was &quot;indefinitely postponed.&quot; 

As a result of such protests, the film was not released in the United States until 1951, with 12 minutes of footage removed. It received great acclaim from critics, but, unlike Lean&#x27;s &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, another Dickens adaptation, no Oscar nominations. The film was banned in Israel for antisemitism. It was banned in Egypt for portraying Fagin too sympathetically.

The March 1949 release of the film in Germany was met with protests outside the Kurbel Cinema by Jewish objectors. The Mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter, was a signatory to their petition which called for the withdrawal of the film. The depiction of Fagin was considered especially problematic in the recent aftermath of The Holocaust.

Beginning in the 1970s, exhibitors began to show the full-length version of Lean&#x27;s film in the United States. It is that version which is now available on DVD.

== Reception ==
===Box office===
The film was the fifth most popular film at the British box office in 1948. According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the &#x27;biggest winner&#x27; at the box office in 1948 Britain was &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; with &quot;Spring in Park Lane&quot; being the best British film and &quot;runners up&quot; being &quot;It Always Rains on Sunday&quot;, &quot;My Brother Jonathan&quot;, &quot;Road to Rio&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Green Dolphin Street&quot;, &quot;Forever Amber&quot;, &quot;Life with Father&quot;, &quot;The Weaker Sex&quot;, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot; and &quot;The Winslow Boy&quot;.

The producer&#x27;s receipts were £277,300 in the UK and £103,100 overseas. According to Rank&#x27;s own records the film had made a profit of £8,000 for the company by December 1949.

===Critical===
After the belated release of the film in the United States, Bosley Crowther praised it in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing:

: &quot;...it is safe to proclaim that it is merely a superb piece of motion picture art and, beyond doubt, one of the finest screen translations of a literary classic ever made.&quot;

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 24 critics, with an average rating of 8.6/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads:

: &quot;David Lean brings the grimy beauty of Charles Dickens&#x27; Victorian England to vivid cinematic life in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, a marvelous adaptation that benefits from Guy Green&#x27;s haunting cinematography and Alec Guinness&#x27; off-kilter performance.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Author Marc Napolitano noted that Lean&#x27;s version of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; had an impact on almost every subsequent adaptation of Dickens&#x27;s novel. The film had two major additions that were not in the original novel. Of the opening scene, an idea that originated from Kay Walsh, Napolitano wrote:

: &quot;The opening scene, which depicts the beleaguered and pregnant Agnes limping her way to the parish workhouse in the midst of a thunderstorm, presents a haunting image that would resonate with subsequent adaptors. Even more significantly, the finale to the Lean adaptation has eclipsed Dickens&#x27;s own finale in the popular memory of the story; the climax atop the roof of Fagin&#x27;s lair is breathtaking.&quot;

Songwriter Lionel Bart acknowledged that Lean&#x27;s film &quot;played a role in his conception&quot; of the musical &quot;Oliver!&quot; Lean biographer Stephen Silverman referred to the 1968 film version of &quot;Oliver!&quot; as &quot;more of an uncredited adaptation of the Lean film in story line and look than of either the Dickens novel or the Bart stage show.&quot; 

Katharyn Crabbe wrote: 

Author Edward LeComte credited Lean for resolving the issue in his film version, where Oliver remains &quot;at the center of the action&quot; and has a &quot;far more heroic&quot; role.

<text>The Amsterdam Admirals was a professional American football team based in Amsterdam, Netherlands, playing in the NFL Europe.

==History==

The Admirals were formed in 1995 as part of the NFL&#x27;s plan to restart the World League of American Football, to be based entirely in Europe. The Admirals were one of three new teams, the others being the Scottish Claymores based in Edinburgh and the Rhein Fire based in Düsseldorf, Germany, to join the old World League&#x27;s European Division teams: the Barcelona Dragons, the Frankfurt Galaxy, and the London Monarchs.

The Admirals began playing their home games at the old Olympisch Stadion, built in 1928 for the Summer Games. They played there for two years until the Amsterdam ArenA was completed in 1996. When the Admirals were forced to schedule their last home game of the 2000 season against the Claymores away from the ArenA as Euro 2000 preparations were finalized, they made a return to the Olympisch Stadion in what turned out to be one of the most unusual games in American football history. The end zone at the north end of the stadium was ruled unsafe by the officials as the surface was in poor condition, so it was decided that the teams would change ends at every change of possession and play towards the other end zone.

They qualified for the 1995 World Bowl with a 9–1 regular season record, but lost to the Frankfurt Galaxy by a score of 26–22. Ten years later, in their eleventh year of existence, the Admirals won their first World Bowl by defeating the defending champion Berlin Thunder 27–21 in the championship game&#x27;s 13th edition. The next season, they failed to defend their title against the Frankfurt Galaxy 22–7 in World Bowl XIV.

Under the &quot;Player Continuity Program&quot;, the Admirals contracted linebacker Derrick Ballard and running back Jonathan Smith for the 2007 season.

<doc id="626921" wikidata="Q746216" url="?curid=626921" title="Ueno Park">
<text>is a spacious public park in the Ueno district of Taitō, Tokyo, Japan. The park was established in 1873 on lands formerly belonging to the temple of Kan&#x27;ei-ji. Amongst the country&#x27;s first public parks, it was founded following the Western example as part of the borrowing and assimilation of international practices that characterizes the early Meiji period. The home of a number of major museums, Ueno Park is also celebrated in spring for its cherry blossoms and &quot;hanami&quot;. In recent times the park and its attractions have drawn over ten million visitors a year, making it Japan&#x27;s most popular city park.

==History==
Ueno Park occupies land once belonging to Kan&#x27;ei-ji, founded in 1625 in the &quot;demon gate&quot;, the unlucky direction to the northeast of Edo Castle. Most of the temple buildings were destroyed in the Battle of Ueno in 1868 during the Boshin War, when the forces of the Tokugawa shogunate were defeated by those aiming at the restoration of imperial rule. In December of that year Ueno Hill became the property of the city of Tokyo, other than for the surviving temple buildings which include the five-storey pagoda of 1639, the Kiyomizu Kannondō (or Shimizudō) of 1631, and approximately coeval main gate (all designated as Important Cultural Properties of Japan).

Various proposals were put forward for the use of the site as a medical school or hospital, but Dutch doctor Bauduin urged instead that the area be turned into a park. In January 1873 the Dajō-kan issued a notice providing for the establishment of public parks, noting that &quot;in prefectures including Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, there are places of historic interest, scenic beauty, and recreation and relaxation where people can visit and enjoy themselves, for example Sensō-ji and Kan&#x27;ei-ji...&quot; This was the year after the foundation of Yellowstone, the world&#x27;s first national park.

Later that year Ueno Park was established, alongside Shiba, Asakusa, Asukayama, and Fukugawa Parks. It was administered first by the Home Ministry&#x27;s Museum Bureau, then by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, before passing to the Ministry of the Imperial Household. In 1924, in honour of the marriage of Hirohito, Ueno Park was presented to the city by Emperor Taishō, receiving the official name that lasts to this day of , &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;Ueno Imperial Gift Park&quot;.

==Natural features==
The park has some 8,800 trees, including &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot;, &quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;, &quot;Zelkova serrata&quot;, Formosan cherry, Somei-Yoshino cherry, and Japanese cherry. There is a further 24,800 m2 of shrubs. Shinobazu Pond is a small lake with an area of 16 ha, extensive lotus beds, and marshland. It provides an important wintering ground for birds. Species commonly found include the tufted duck, Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, common pochard, little grebe, great egret, and great cormorant. The Baer&#x27;s pochard, ring-necked duck, and American wigeon have also been recorded.

The central island houses a shrine to Benzaiten, goddess of fortune, modelled on Chikubu Island in Lake Biwa. The area was once full of &quot;rendezvous teahouses&quot;, equivalent of the modern love hotel. After the Pacific War the pond was drained and used for the cultivation of cereals and subsequently there were plans to turn the site into a baseball stadium or multi-storey carpark. The lotus pond was restored in 1949, although much of it was again accidentally drained in 1968 during work on a new subway line.

In all there are some eight hundred cherry trees in the park, although with the inclusion of those belonging to the Ueno Tōshō-gū shrine, temple buildings, and other neighbouring points the total reaches some twelve hundred. Inspired, Matsuo Bashō wrote &quot;cloud of blossoms - is the temple bell from Ueno or Asakusa&quot;.

==Cultural facilities==
Ueno Park is home to a number of museums. The very words in Japanese for museum as well as for art were coined in the Meiji period (from 1868) to capture Western concepts after the Iwakura Mission and other early visits to North America and Europe. The Tokyo National Museum was founded in 1872 after the first exhibition by the Museum Department of the new Ministry of Education. In the same year the Ministry of Education Museum opened, now the National Museum of Nature and Science.

The National Museum of Western Art was founded in 1959 based on the collection of the industrialist (Kawasaki group) Matsukata Kōjirō; the collection was left in storage in France by Matsukata and it was returned by the French government in 1959 after the Treaty of San Francisco. The building is by Le Corbusier who used it to express his concept of the Museum of Unlimited Growth, based on an expanding spiral. It has been nominated for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List.

Other museums include the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, dating back to 1926, and Shitamachi Museum of 1980, which is dedicated to the culture of the &quot;Low City&quot;. 

The park was also chosen as home for the Japan Academy (1879), Tokyo School of Fine Arts (1889), and Tokyo School of Music (1890). 

The first western-style concert hall in the country, the Sōgakudō Concert Hall of 1890 (ICP) was donated to the ward in 1983 and reconstructed on another site in the park, where it is used for concerts. The Tokyo Bunka Kaikan opened in 1961 as a venue for opera and ballet, in celebration of the five hundredth anniversary of the foundation of the city of Edo. 

The Imperial Library was established as the national library in 1872 and opened in Ueno Park in 1906; the National Diet Library opened in Chiyoda in 1948 and the building now houses the International Library of Children&#x27;s Literature.

==Other landmarks==
Tokugawa Ieyasu is enshrined at Ueno Tōshō-gū, dating to 1651.

Flame of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Memorial: On the right of the alley leading North to Tokugawa Ieyasu Tōshō-gū shrine is a grey stone memorial with a permanently burning flame in memory of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki of August 1945 at the end of World War II. This Flame of Hiroshima and Nagasaki memorial was initiated in Hiroshima shortly after the nuclear bombings by Mr. Tatsuo Yamamoto (1916–2004), from the town of Hoshino. This flame was later merged with a flame started in Nagasaki. In 1968 members of the Tokyo&#x27;s Shitamachi People Association put forward the idea of lighting the flame at the precinct of Tosho-gu shrine in Tokyo&#x27;s Ueno Park. In April 1989, an “Association for the Flame of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Lit at Ueno Toshogu” was founded and tens of thousands of people took part in the fundraising for over one year. The construction of the monument was completed on July 21, 1990. The dedication carved into the memorial stone states that “We, hereby pledge to keep burning the A-bomb flame, convinced that this monument will contribute to strengthening the worldwide people&#x27;s movement to abolish nuclear weapons and achieve peace, which is the most urgent task for the people across the borders”.

Gojōten Jinja is dedicated to scholar Sugawara no Michizane, while neighbouring Hanazono Inari Jinja has red-bibbed Inari fox statues in an atmospheric grotto. There is a Yayoi-period burial mound on a small hill near the park&#x27;s centre. For a decade until 1894 there was horse racing near Shinobazu Pond. Nowadays there is a baseball field, named in honour of poet Masaoka Shiki, fan of the sport. As well as the first art museum in Japan, the park had the first zoo, first tram, first May Day celebrations (in 1920), and staged a number of industrial expositions. Ueno Station opened nearby in 1883. After the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923, notices of missing persons were attached to the statue of Saigō Takamori. Ueno Park and its surroundings figure prominently in Japanese fiction, including &quot;The Wild Geese&quot; by Mori Ōgai.

One of the lanterns that is present at the park is a stone lantern that was one of two carved in 1651 to memorialize Tokugawa Iemitsu. Both lanterns stood at the park until the governor of Tokyo gifted one of them in 1954 to the city of Washington, D.C. to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Commodore Matthew C. Perry&#x27;s signing of the 1854 Japan-US Treaty of Amity and Friendship. The lantern brought to Washington is known as the Japanese Lantern and currently resides in West Potomac Park among a number of cherry trees, the first of which were gifted by Tokyo mayor Yukio Ozaki in 1912. For over 50 years, the lighting of the lantern by the Embassy of Japan’s appointed Cherry Blossom Princess has opened the United States&#x27; annual National Cherry Blossom Festival.

==Education==

Taito City Board of Education operates public elementary and junior high schools.

Uenokoen 1-11-ban are zoned to Shinobugaoka Elementary School (忍岡小学校), while 12-18-ban are zoned to Negishi Elementary School (根岸小学校).

Part of Uenokoen (1-14 ban and parts of 15-17 ban) is zoned to Ueno Junior High School (上野中学校), while another part (18-ban and the rest of 15-17 ban) is zoned to Shinobugaoka Junior High School (忍岡中学校).

==Squatting==
Many homeless people squat in Ueno Park. Found among the park&#x27;s treelines and wooded areas, homeless camps border on the size of small villages, with an internal structure, culture, and support system. The long-term shelters are typically constructed of cardboard covered with blue tarps. The police occasionally tear down the camps and drive out or arrest the homeless, who return as soon as they can. While squatting is illegal in Japan, homelessness is seen as an endemic problem in Tokyo and other cities, and the presence of squatters is accepted as an inevitability.

<text>The Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA) is an organisation founded in 1980 to expose Aboriginal music and culture to the rest of Australia. It started with 8KIN-FM, the first Aboriginal radio station in the country. Based in Alice Springs, the organisation is particularly focused on the involvement of the local Indigenous community in its production. CAAMA is involved in radio, television and recorded music.

==History==
===Origins and Imparja===
In 1980, CAAMA originally established itself as a public radio station by two Aboriginal people and one &quot;whitefella&quot;: Freda Glynn, Phillip Batty, and John Macumba. 8KIN-FM was the first Aboriginal radio station.

The success of the station quickly grew, leading its content to extend into music (country music and Aboriginal rock), call-ins, discussion, and news and current affairs. Broadcasts were made in six different languages, alongside English, and operated about fifteen hours every day. Later expansions saw the station move into AM and short-wave broadcasts with educational programmes, live recordings of Aboriginal bands, and commercials for local Aboriginal products and services. In 1984, CAAMA started to produce a video newsletter to circulate to those communities without easy access to radio facilities.

CAAMA obtained its Regional Commercial Television Services licence in 1986 after concern was raised that Australia&#x27;s first satellite (AUSSAT), which was set to bring commercial television to regional and remote sections of Australia, would have a detrimental impact on Aboriginal languages and cultures in Central Australia. CAAMA made a bid to obtain the licence being offered in 1985 via the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal Central Zone RCTS licence hearings process. CAAMA&#x27;s bid was a symbolic act that was then taken seriously, as “the tribunal provided the arena for the articulation of national media policies at least nominally in support of the concerns of remote-living Aboriginal people”. In January 1988, the private commercial television station owned by CAAMA, Imparja, began broadcasting, servicing at least 100,000 viewers in Central Australia.

Imparja had contributed to a visible increase of Aboriginal identity in the Australian media landscape. The station was crucial in developing content which attempted to maintain and sustain Aboriginal culture. One example included &quot;Nganampa-Anwernekenbe&quot; [Ours], the first entirely Indigenous language television programme, sub-titled in English and produced in Australia, which reflected Aboriginal culture through storytelling and unique performing and visual arts content. There were also cleanliness and anti-alcohol community service advertisements which aimed to promote a healthier lifestyle in a culturally appropriate and effective manner. A series of films independently created films about, or created by, Aboriginal people were created in 1991.

During the first few years of Imparja, CAAMA faced growing concerns from media activists that commercial programming would consume local content (Michaels 1984). Other concerns were raised of the lack of Aboriginal presence in Imparja&#x27;s programming (Batty 1992) that, although Imparja was the largest television enterprise owned by Aboriginal people in Australia, only 10% its staff were Aboriginal (Ginsburg 1993); that some broadcasts reflected a lack of sufficient Aboriginal programming content; and others raised issues of broadcast quality. American anthropologist Faye Ginsburg suggested in 1993 that the establishment of CAAMA and the spread of communications technology could threaten the relationship between generations and the respect for traditional knowledge.

However, the importance of CAAMA&#x27;s multimedia-based approach has ensured that Aboriginal media is an important part of the Australian media landscape, and to the social, cultural, and economic development of Aboriginal people in remote parts of Australia, as seen by CAAMA&#x27;s recent employment policies. Faye Ginsburg wrote in 1994:
===21st century===
In 2005 CAAMA submitted a report to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs’ inquiry into Indigenous employment. The report outlined several ways government leaders could access future policy in regards to Indigenous employment, using CAAMA as a case study. Some key issues CAAMA raised included: skills training; funding; recruitment; increase in Indigenous population; youth employment; strengthening links between education and training; establish and sustain networks between the private and public sectors, alongside the community; and collaborate with pre-existing organisations in training Aboriginal people.

The second section of the report outlined how CAAMA had contributed to the training and employment of Aboriginal people in Central Australia. In their 25 years of operations up until then, CAAMA had had an active &quot;Aboriginalisation policy&quot;, which meaning that 65% of employees were Aboriginal. CAAMA had also assisted in the education of over 100 Indigenous people, of whom a majority of their trainees were part of the Major Indigenous Employment Strategy (1988–1993). CAAMA suggested that their success has been afforded by the commitment of government; implementation of the Major Indigenous Employment Strategy; an understanding of social, cultural, and economic issues impacting Aboriginal people; and their flexible learning environment.

In 2009 CAAMA developed a business plan to identity ways to enhance their viability and sustainability with less reliance on government funding, and to increase new opportunities in New Media products and other related services and products.

In March 2020 CAAMA was put under special administration, after its debt level reached . In August 2021 the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations expected the organisation to be released from this administration and a new board appointed soon, after its stations, now operating seven communities, were up and running and making a profit again. CAAMA did, however, still owe to the Australian Tax Office and to its major source of funding, the National Indigenous Australians Agency (NIAA).

==Services==
===CAAMA Radio===
Established as 8KIN-FM in 1980–81, this was the first Aboriginal radio station in the country.

CAAMA Radio provides twenty-four hours Indigenous radio programming to over 600,000 people in Australia. It is the largest Aboriginal media organisation in the country since 1981, with the second largest audience reach in Australia. CAAMA broadcast through 12 Remote Aboriginal Communities Services (RIBS) and a mobile outside broadcasting truck, providing radio to several remote Aboriginal communities in over 30 different languages, including Papunya, Ntaria (Hermannsbug), Ltyentye Apurte (Santa Teresa), and Areyonga.

===Film and television production===

CAAMA Productions Pty Ltd is (was?) the largest Indigenous owned production house in Australia, with programming based on Indigenous cultures, lifestyle, and issues. Some of CAAMA&#x27;s award-winning productions include:

* &quot;My Colour Your Kind&quot; (1998), a short film written and directed by Danielle Maclean which explores the journey of a young Aboriginal albino girl
* &quot;Cold Turkey&quot; (2003), a film written and directed by Steven McGregor, portraying the lives of brothers Shane and Robby and exploring the changing nature of their relationship
* &quot;Green Bush&quot; (2005), written and directed by Warwick Thornton, is the story of local radio DJ Kenny and his audience - the local prison inmates
* &quot;Double Trouble (Australian TV series)&quot; (2007), the first Aboriginal-produced children&#x27;s television show, which on Nine Network and the Disney Channel
* &quot;Samson and Delilah &quot; (co-production with Scarlett Pictures), a drama feature film directed by Warwick Thornton and starring Rowan McNamara and Marissa Gibson, both young first time actors. The film competed at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, winning the Caméra d&#x27;Or (&#x27;Gold Camera Award&#x27; for best first feature film) at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The film also won the Asia Pacific Screen Award for Best Film in 2009.

===Music===
CAAMA Music is a record label which produces 90% of its recordings in Indigenous languages. Performances organised by CAAMA have been popular with audiences, with people travelling from across the area to attend. One recent event, the Yeperenye Festival, drew a crowd of 30,000. Musicians like Gawurra and Alice Skye, who are recorded by CAAMA are also seen on the Imparja, SBS and ABC television networks. In conjunction with CAAMA Radio, CAAMA Music transmits outside broadcasts of performances by Aboriginal musicians.

==Notable people==
Successful CAAMA Indigenous trainees include Erica Glynn, who later became a mentor to a group of young filmmakers in the 1990s, including Beck Cole, her cousin Danielle MacLean, Warwick Thornton, Steven McGregor, David Jowsey, and sound recordist/ director David Tranter.

Others who spent time at CAAMA include Rachel Perkins; Alan Collins (AFI award-winning cinematographer); Priscilla Collins (executive producer, AFI nominee); Peter Clarke (online editor, Imparja Television); and Angela Bates (journalist, SBS Television).

<text>The Catholic People&#x27;s Party (, KVP) was a Catholic Christian democratic political party in the Netherlands. The party was founded in 1945 as a continuation of the interwar Roman Catholic State Party, which was in turn a successor of the General League of Roman Catholic Electoral Associations. The party was in government throughout its existence. In 1977, a federation of parties including the Catholic People&#x27;s Party, the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and the Christian Historical Union (CHU) ran together under the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) banner. The three participating parties formally dissolved to form the CDA in 1980.

==History==
=== 1945–1965 ===
The KVP was founded on 22 December 1945. It was a continuation of the pre-war Roman Catholic State Party (RKSP). Unlike the RKSP, the KVP was open to people of all denominations, but mainly Catholics supported the party. The party adopted a more progressive course and a more modern image than its predecessor.

In the 1946 general election, the party won a third of the vote, and joined the newly founded social democratic Labour Party (PvdA) to form a government coalition. This Roman/Red coalition (&quot;Roman&quot; for the KVP, &quot;Red&quot; for the PvdA) lasted until 1958. In the first two years, the KVP&#x27;s Louis Beel led the Cabinet. Beel was not the party&#x27;s leader, a post which was taken by Carl Romme, who led the KVP from the House of Representatives between 1946 and 1961. After the 1948 general election, the PvdA supplied the prime minister Willem Drees. The PvdA and the KVP were joined by combinations of the Protestant-Christian Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and Christian Historical Union (CHU) and the liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) to form oversized cabinets, which often held a comfortable two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. The cabinets were oriented at rebuilding Dutch society and economy after the ravages of World War II and grant independence to Indonesia. That last point caused a split within the KVP; in 1948, a small group of Catholics opposed to decolonisation and cooperation with social democrats broke away to form the Catholic National Party (KNP). Under pressure of the Catholic Church, the two parties reunited in 1955.


The KVP was at the height of its power from 1958 to 1965. It was the dominant force in all cabinets, and every prime minister during this time was a party member. In 1958 the fourth Drees cabinet fell and Louis Beel formed an interim cabinet with KVP, ARP and CHU. After the 1959 general election, the KVP formed a centre-right cabinet with ARP, CHU and VVD, led by KVP member Jan de Quay. It continued to strengthen the welfare state. After the 1963 general election, this cabinet was succeeded by a new cabinet of KVP-CHU-ARP-VVD, which was led by the KVP&#x27;s Victor Marijnen. This coalition oversaw an economic boom. Norbert Schmelzer became the party&#x27;s new leader, again operating within the House of Representatives and not the cabinet. A cabinet crisis over the Netherlands Public Broadcasting, however, caused the cabinet to fall in 1965. The KVP and ARP formed a cabinet with the PvdA, led by the KVP&#x27;s Jo Cals. This cabinet also fell in the Night of Schmelzer, in which Norbert Schmelzer forced a cabinet crisis over the cabinet&#x27;s financial policy. This was the first fall of cabinet directly broadcast on television. An interim government of KVP and ARP was formed, led by the ARP&#x27;s Jelle Zijlstra.

=== 1965–1980 ===
The period 1965–1980 was period of decline, crisis and dissent for the KVP. The party&#x27;s vote share began to decline after 1966 as a result of depillarisation and secularisation; there were fewer Catholics, and Catholics no longer necessarily supported a Catholic party.

In the 1967 general election, the KVP lost 15% of its votes and eight seats. During the election campaign the KVP, ARP and CHU declared that they wanted to continue cooperating with each other. Cooperation with the PvdA was much less important. This led to unrest among young and left-wing KVP supporters, including Ruud Lubbers, Jo Cals, Erik Jurgens and Jacques Aarden, who called themselves Christian Radicals. After the election, this promise was upheld and the KVP formed a cabinet with its old partners, led by Piet de Jong. After much debate, some of the Christian Radicals broke away from the KVP in 1968 to form the Political Party of Radicals (PPR). These include three members of parliament, who form their own parliamentary party, Groep Aarden. Lubbers and Cals stayed with the KVP. The new party became a close partner of the PvdA. In the 1971 general election, the KVP lost another seven seats (18% of its vote). The KVP again joined the ARP, CHU and VVD to form a new centre-right cabinet with right-wing dissenters of the PvdA, united in Democratic Socialists &#x27;70 (DS&#x27;70). The ARP&#x27;s Barend Biesheuvel led the cabinet. In 1972 the cabinet fell because of internal problems of the junior partner, DS&#x27;70.

In the subsequent election, the KVP again lost eight seats, leaving only 27, 23 less than in 1963. The cabinet lost its majority and the KVP saw no alternative than to cooperate with the PvdA and its allies PPR and Democrats 66 (D&#x27;66). An extra-parliamentary cabinet was formed by PvdA, PPR and D66 joined by prominent progressives from KVP and ARP. The KVP&#x27;s ministers include the minister of Justice Dries van Agt and the minister of the Economy Ruud Lubbers. The KVP did not officially support this cabinet, which was led by social democrat Joop den Uyl. This cabinet was characterised by infighting and fell just before the 1977 general election.

In the 1970s, the KVP realised that if it was to continue, it needed to find new ways of cooperating. Ideas to form a broad Christian democratic party, like the German Christian Democratic Union, were brought into practice. In 1974 the three parties formed a federation, called Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). In the 1977 election the CDA won more seats than the KVP, ARP and CHU had together. After the election, Dries van Agt became prime minister. In 1980, the three parties officially dissolved themselves into the CDA.

The Catholics still constitute a powerful group within the CDA. Indeed, the CDA&#x27;s first two prime ministers, van Agt and Ruud Lubbers, came from the KVP side of the merger. In the early years, a system of equal representation of Catholics and Protestants was practiced, from which the KVP as the only Catholic group profited. Nowadays many CDA members, like Maxime Verhagen and Maria van der Hoeven have a background in the KVP&#x27;s political Catholicism.

== Name ==
The name Catholic People&#x27;s Party (Dutch: &quot;Katholieke Volkspartij&quot;; KVP), must be seen in contrast with the name of its predecessor Roman Catholic State Party. The party no longer uses the name &quot;Roman Catholic&quot;, but simply &quot;Catholic&quot;, de-emphasising its religious affiliation. It is no longer a state party, but a people&#x27;s party, emphasising its progressive, democratic nature. The new name emphasises the KVP&#x27;s progressive, democratic and non-denominational image.

== Ideology ==

The KVP was a Christian democratic party, which based itself on the Bible and Catholic dogma.

As such, it was a proponent of a mixed economy: A strong welfare state should be combined with a free market, with a corporatist organisation. Trade unions and employers&#x27; organisations were to negotiate on wages in a Social and Economic Council and should make legislation for some economic sectors on themselves, without government intervention, in so-called &quot;Productschappen&quot;.

The state should watch over the morality of the people: divorce should be limited, recreation should be moral (for instance different swimming hours for women and men) and the family should be preserved. Families were to be helped by fiscal policies, such as the &quot;kinderbijslag&quot;, support by the government, by the newly set up Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Welfare, and the possibility to buy their own home.

Internationally, the KVP was a staunch proponent of European integration and cooperation within NATO. The party sought the middle ground in the issue of decolonisation: Indonesia and Suriname should be independent countries within a Dutch Commonwealth.

==Electoral performance==
=== Municipal and provincial government ===
The party was particularly strong in the southern provinces of Limburg and North Brabant, where it often held 90% of the seats in the provincial and municipal legislatures and supplied all provincial and municipal governments, provincial governors and mayors. In regions like Twente, West Friesland and Zeelandic Flanders it held similar positions in municipalities, but cooperated with other parties on the provincial level.

== Electorate ==
The KVP was supported by Catholics of all classes. Its strength was in the Catholic south of the Netherlands: North Brabant and Limburg, where it often obtained more than 90% of vote. It was also strong in Catholic regions like Twente, West Friesland and Zeelandic Flanders.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the KVP lost part of its electorate to progressive parties like the Political Party of Radicals, the Labour Party and Democrats 66.

== Organisation ==
=== Linked organisations ===
The KVP had an own youth organisation, the Catholic People&#x27;s Party Youth Groups (Dutch: &quot;Katholieke Volkspartij Jongeren Groupen&quot;; KVPJG) and a scientific foundation, the Centre for Political Formation.

=== International organisations ===
In the European Parliament the KVP&#x27;s members sat in the Christian Democratic group.

=== Pillarised organisations ===
The KVP had close links to many other Catholic institutions such as the Catholic Church and together they formed the Catholic pillar. These organisations included the Catholic Labour Union NKV, the Catholic Employers Organisation KNOV, the Catholic Farmers&#x27; Organisation KNBLTB, Catholic Hospitals united in the Yellow-White Cross and Catholic Schools. The Catholic broadcasting association &quot;Katholieke Radio Omroep&quot; and the Catholic newspaper &quot;De Volkskrant&quot; were the voices of the KVP.

=== Relationships to other parties ===
As a Christian party, the KVP had strong ties with the conservative Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party and Christian Historical Union. The strong ties resulted in several cabinets in the period from 1946 to 1977 and the formation of the Christian Democratic Appeal, in which the three parties united in 1974.

The KVP had a strong centre-left group within its ranks. These supported closer cooperation with the social democratic Labour Party. This resulted in several cabinets with the PvdA, but also splits within the party, most notably the formation of the Political Party of Radicals

As noted by one study, in the early post-war years &quot;the Catholic party was dominated by its left wing, with the result that the PvdA and the KVP had relatively few disagreements on policy issues.&quot; Beginning in 1952 however, &quot;the focus of power within the KVP shifted to the right, resulting in frequent conflicts within the cabinet, especially in the area of economic and social policy.&quot; According to another study, the Catholic party shifted to the right between 1958 and 1963. Nevertheless, new social welfare benefits were established under successive KVP-led coalition governments.

== International comparison ==
As the party of a Catholic minority in a dominantly Protestant country, the KVP is comparable to the German Centre Party, which existed before World War II, and the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland. Its political position and agenda are similar to other catholic Christian democratic parties in Europe, such as the Flemish Christian Democratic and Flemish party and the Italian Christian Democracy.

<text>Ancistrocheirus lesueurii, the sharpear enope squid, is the only species in the genus Ancistrocheirus and family Ancistrocheiridae. With a mantle length of , this moderately sized squid may be found throughout the tropical and subtropical oceans. They tend to be found at mesopelagic depths ( down).

Although only one species is recognized, some have suggested more than one species may exist due to differences in the paralarval morphology. Paralarva is the first free-living stage for cephalopods.

==Characteristics==
The buccal crown of the sharpear enope squid is heavily pigmented. The squid has no vesicles. There are hooks on all its arms. The suckers are absent from its manus and the squid&#x27;s dactylus is reduced.

===Photophores===
Photophores occur throughout its body. Large photophores are present on its head, funnel, base of arms, and tentacular stalk. Other photophores are present on the ventral surface of its mantle (usually 22), with numerous very small photophores on its head, funnel, base of arms II and tentacular stalk. Mature males have large photophores on tips of arms IV opposite the mouth. Mature females have photophores on tips of their dorsal six arms. The number of large photopores on the squid&#x27;s mantle increases as it matures.

==Ecology==
They are eaten by the sperm whale in Southeast Asia and the Galapagos waters

<text>The Queens Park Arts Centre is an independent arts centre and theatre in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England.

==Programme==
Queens Park Arts Centre offers more than 100 workshops on a weekly basis, covering artistic disciplines such as pottery, painting &amp; drawing, drama, dance, music, woodwork, textiles and jewellery making. Additional classes run during the school holidays, whilst other one-off workshops explore more specialised subjects such as blacksmithing.

Queens Park is also the home of the Limelight Theatre, a 120-seater venue which offers live music, theatre and comedy on Friday and Saturday nights. Acts who have performed at the theatre include Eddie Izzard, Jo Brand, John Otway, Wild Willy Barrett and Chris Ramsey.

Additional facilities at the Centre include multiple exhibition spaces, a Coffee Shop, licensed bar, and a shop selling art supplies and resources.

The Centre regularly holds events for the local community, including Art &amp; Craft Fairs and Maker&#x27;s Fairs.

Successful projects at the Centre included the WanderHouse Outreach Project - which has enabled artistic collaborations with thousands of children in schools across Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire, and still ongoing, Unbound - the Centre&#x27;s resident theatre company which stages multiple productions each year, including a pantomime.

Sarah Lewis is the Chief Executive at the centre. The centre&#x27;s Limelight Theatre Manager is Dario Knight. Ellie Kirkup is currently the Arts Centre Co-ordinator.

==History==
Queens Park Arts Centre is based in a former Edwardian primary school and receives no funding from local government. It is the largest independent arts centre in the United Kingdom. It was established in 1980 and was first directed by Malcolm Thackwray through funding by Buckinghamshire County Council. In 1998, the Centre became an independent company when its government funding was withdrawn. £325,000 was raised to purchase the freehold to the site, which was secured in 2009. Since then in excess of £200,000 has been raised to refurbish and restore the building.

<text>An athletic coach is a person coaching in sport, involved in the direction, instruction, and training of a sports team or athlete.

== History ==
The original sense of the word &quot;Coach&quot; is that of a horse-drawn carriage, deriving ultimately from the Hungarian city of Kocs where such vehicles were first made. Students at the University of Oxford in the early nineteenth century used the slang word to refer to a private tutor who would drive a less able student through his examinations just like horse driving.

Britain took the lead in upgrading the status of sports in the 19th century. For sports to become professionalized, &quot;coacher&quot; had to become established. It gradually professionalized in the Victorian era and the role was well established by 1914. In the First World War, military units sought out the coaches to supervise physical conditioning and develop morale-building teams.

== Effectiveness ==
John Wooden had a philosophy of coaching that encouraged planning, organization, and understanding, and that knowledge was important but not everything when being an effective coach. Traditionally coaching expertise or effectiveness has been measured by win–loss percentage, satisfaction of players, or years of coaching experience, but like in teacher expertise those metrics are highly ambiguous. Coaching expertise or effectiveness describes good coaching, which looks at coaching behaviour, dispositions, education, experience, and knowledge.

A widely used definition of effective coaching is &quot;the consistent application of integrated professional, interpersonal, and intrapersonal knowledge, to improve athletes competence, confidence, connection, and character in specific coaching contexts&quot;.

=== Knowledge ===
Coaches need descriptive knowledge and procedural knowledge that can relate to all aspects of coaching, with expert coaches using tacit knowledge more freely. Teachers&#x27; knowledge has been categorized, like coaches knowledge with various terms being used. Such terms assist players and athletes&#x27; understand what the coach is trying to get them to execute. Augmented feedback is one of the terms used, which is the term used for the different ways a coach can give evaluations. Many categories fall under content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and pedagogical-content knowledge. When considering the need to build relationships with others and athletes, interpersonal knowledge has been included. Then when considering professional development, which requires the skills to learn from experience while utilizing reflective practice, intrapersonal knowledge has been included.

It is rare in professional sport for a team not to hire a former professional player, but playing and coaching have different knowledge bases. The combination of professional, interpersonal, and intrapersonal knowledge can lead to good thinking habits, maturity, wisdom, and capacity to make reasonable judgements.

=== Professionalism ===
The subject, sport, curricular, and pedagogical knowledge all fall under this category of professional coaches knowledge. Including the &quot;ologies&quot; of sports science like; sport psychology, sport biomechanics, sport nutrition, exercise physiology, motor control, critical thinking, sociology, strength and conditioning, and sporting tactics, with all the associated sub areas of knowledge. This category of knowledge is what most coach education has been focused on but this alone is not enough to be an effective coach.

Coaching is not just about sport specific skills and education, especially when taking a holistic approach. Keeping sports people safe, and healthy while participating are responsibilities of a coach as well as awareness of social factors like the relative age effect.

=== Interpersonality ===
Much of coaching involves interacting with players, staff, community, opposition, and then family members in youth sport. The relationships built in a sports team influence the social interactions which can affect player performance and development, fan culture, and in professional sport, financial backing. Effective coaches have knowledge that helps in all social contexts to make the best of each situation, with the coach–athlete relationship. being one of the most crucial to get right.

Excellent communication skills are imperative for coaches in order to provide their athletes with the adequate skills, knowledge and mental as well as tactical ability.

=== Intrapersonality ===
A coaches ability to improve relies on professional development in continued learning which uses a combination of evaluation and reflective practice. Their recognition of personal ethical views and disposition are also elements of intrapersonal knowledge. The understanding of oneself and ability to use introspection and reflection are skills that take time to develop, using deliberate practice in each changing context. Coaching expertise requires this knowledge much like teachers as each experience can confirm or contradict a prior belief in player performance. The internal and external framing of a coaches role can impact their reflection, suggesting perspective can be a limitation promoting the idea of a coaching community for feedback.

== Athlete outcomes ==
The coaching behavior assessment system has been used to show that coaching knowledge and behavior have significant influence on participants psychological profile affecting self-esteem, motivation, satisfaction, attitudes, perceived competence, and performance. For a coach to be seen as effective, the people they work with should be improving, with expert coaches being able to sustain that over an extended period of time. There are various areas of development that can be categorized, which was first done with a 5 C&#x27;s model: competence, confidence, connection, character and compassion and was then later shortened to a 4 C&#x27;s model by combining character and compassion.

People&#x27;s competence can relate to their sport-specific technical and tactical skills, performance skills, improved health and fitness, and overall training habits. Their confidence relating to an internal sense of overall positive self-worth. Having a good connections is the positive bonds and social relationships with people inside and outside of the sporting context. Then character is respect for the sport and other participating showing good levels of morality, integrity, empathy, and responsibility.

The competence of a person is linked to leadership and centered around becoming a self-reliant member of a sports team and society in the coaching context. Competencies have guided much of sport psychology supporting positive youth development.

The self-determination theory suggests an environment that supports autonomous decision making, can help develop competence, confidence, and connection to others affecting motivation. Effective coaches therefore create supportive environments while building good relationships with the people they coach.

=== Support staff ===
In professional sports, a coach is usually supported by one or more assistant coaches and a specialist team including sports scientists. The staff may include coordinators, a strength and conditioning coach, sport psychologist, physiotherapist, nutritionist, biomechanist, or sports analyst.

== Association football ==

In association football, the roles of a coach can vary depending on the level of seniority they are coaching at, the professional level that they&#x27;re coaching at, and the country they are coaching in, amongst others. In youth football, the duties of a coach is primarily to aid in the development of technical skills. Additional skills that are important for a coach to help youth players develop is motor skills, stamina and the ability to read the game of play accordingly.

A solid foundation of tactical awareness is imperative for youth players to develop, because by the time they reach senior level (aged 18 and over), they are expected to know the tactical basis of the game - first team coaches at senior level do not actively teach tactics, they mainly just implement them. Therefore, youth coaches need to have a solid understanding of the tactics of the game, so that they can facilitate, as a pedagogue, for their players&#x27; growth also on the tactical level.

In professional football, the role of the coach or trainer is focused on the training and development of a club&#x27;s first team. This means that the head coach is responsible for the first team strategy, development, training session schedule and player development. The head coach is accompanied by one or more assistant coaches, and is also assisted by medical staff and athletic trainers. A first team coach at a professional level is expecting of players to already be well-versed into the (general) tactics of football, so that the coach can instead focus on implementing their version of football tactics (style of play) into the team.

In English football, the director of a professional football team is commonly awarded the position of manager, a role that combines the duties of coach and sporting director.

All coaches of association football teams need to carefully consider the tactical ability and skill level of their teams when selecting tactics and strategy for games as well as practice.

==Ice hockey==

The coach in ice hockey is the person responsible for directing the team during games and practices, prepares strategy and decides which players will participate in games.

== United Kingdom ==
=== Cricket ===

Coaches have much less of a role in cricket matches than in other sports, with the team captain making most strategic decisions for their team. During the game, cricket coaches generally focus on occasionally sending out messages or feedback to the team, especially during breaks in the play such as time-outs; otherwise, most coaches have an auxiliary role in helping the players practice, with each one generally specializing in improving the batting and bowling skills of the players. In recent years, fielding coaches have received more priority, as the shorter formats of the game have made good fielding more valuable.

== United States ==
All major U.S. collegiate sports have associations for their coaches to engage in professional development activities, but some sports&#x27; professional coaches have less formal associations, without developing into a group resembling a union in the way that athletic players in many leagues have.

U.S. collegiate coaching contracts require termination without the payment of a settlement if the coach is found to be in serious violation of named rules, usually with regard to the recruiting or retention of players in violation of amateur status.

The NFL head coaches have an association, called NFL Coaches Association (NFLCA), which includes almost all the coaches in the NFL.

=== American baseball ===
At baseball&#x27;s professional level in North America, the person who heads the coaching staff does not use the title of &quot;head coach&quot;, but is instead called the field manager. Baseball &quot;coaches&quot; at that level are members of the coaching staff under the overall supervision of the manager, with each coach having a specialized role. The baseball field manager is essentially equivalent a head coach in other American professional sports leagues; player transactions are handled by the general manager. The term &quot;manager&quot; used without qualification almost always refers to the field manager, while the general manager is often called the GM.

At amateur levels, the terminology is more similar to that of other sports. The person known as the &quot;manager&quot; in professional leagues is generally called the &quot;head coach&quot; in amateur leagues; this terminology is standard in U.S. college baseball.

=== American football ===
In American football, like many other sports, there are many coaches and assistant coaches. American football includes a head coach, associate/assistant head coach, an offensive coordinator, a defensive coordinator, a special teams coordinator, position coaches, among other assistant coaches which can include passing game coordinator, running game coordinator, and advisors. They&#x27;re support staff such as strength and conditioning coach, quality control, analyst, and recruiting coaches.

<text>Marajó () is a large coastal island in the state of Pará, Brazil. It is the main and largest of the islands in the Marajó Archipelago. Marajó Island is separated from the mainland by Marajó Bay, Pará River, smaller rivers (especially Macacos and Tajapuru), Companhia River, Jacaré Grande River, Vieira Grande Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.

From approximately 400 BC to 1600 AD, Marajó was the site of an advanced Pre-Columbian society called the Marajoara culture, which may have numbered more than 100,000 people at its peak. Today, the island is known for its large water buffalo population, as well as the &quot;pororoca&quot; tidal bore periodically exhibited by high tides overcoming the usual complex hydrodynamic interactions in the surrounding rivers. It is the second-largest island in South America, and the 35th largest island in the world.

With a land area of Marajó is comparable in size to Switzerland. Its maximum span is long and in perpendicular width.

== Geography ==
Marajó Island is separated from the mainland by Marajó Bay, the Pará River, some smaller rivers (especially Macacos and Tajapuru), the Companhia River, the Jacaré Grande River, Vieira Grande Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean.

The island sits almost directly on the Equator.

Together with smaller neighboring islands that are separated from Marajó by rivers, they form the Marajó Archipelago, with an aggregate area of .
The archipelago is contained in the Marajó Archipelago Environmental Protection Area, a sustainable-use conservation unit established in 1989 to protect the environment of the region.
Large parts of the islands are flooded during the rainy season because of higher water levels of the rivers along the coast and heavy rainfall in the interior. Marajó is almost entirely flat. During the rainy season, much of the island becomes flooded as a large lake.

There are 20 large rivers on the island. Because of the changing water levels and regular seasonal flooding, many settlements are built on stilts (&quot;Palafitas&quot;).

The island is known for the &quot;pororoca&quot;, a tidal bore phenomenon in the river that creates large waves reaching in height. It is a tourist destination, especially for surfing of the bore.

=== Ecology ===
The eastern side of the island is dominated by savanna vegetation. There are large fazendas with animal husbandry. This is also the location of Lake Arari, which has an area of , but shrinks by 80% during the dry season. There are large herds of domesticated water buffalo, which are technically invasive to the island; they now number about 450,000, higher than the island&#x27;s human population. The western side of the island is characterized by várzea forests and small farms. Lumber and açaí palm are produced there.

The island is in the Marajó várzea ecoregion, an area of seasonally and tidally flooded várzea forest.

To the north of the large savanna area are palm swamps, mainly with Buriti Palm (&quot;Mauritia flexuosa&quot;) and &quot;Euterpe oleracea&quot;. During the rainy season, the swamps are flooded one meter high. Little is known about the ecology of these swamps.

===Municipalities===
The most important towns are in the southeastern portion of the island: Soure, Salvaterra, and the largest city, Breves. They feature a basic touristic infrastructure and are popular because of the generous, lightly populated beaches. The city of Soure, on the island&#x27;s Atlantic coast, serves as an entry point to the island via its ferry link to Belém.

The island is shared by 16 municipalities of three microregions:

* Microregion of Arari:
** Cachoeira do Arari
** Chaves
** Muaná
** Ponta de Pedras
** Salvaterra
** Santa Cruz do Arari
** Soure
* Microregion of Furos de Breves:
** Afuá
** Anajás
** Breves
** Curralinho
** São Sebastião da Boa Vista
* Microregion of Portel:
** Bagre
** Gurupá
** Melgaço
** Portel

== History ==
The island was the site of an advanced pre-Columbian society, the Marajoara culture, which existed from approximately 400 BC to 1600 AD. The island has been a center of archaeological exploration and scholarship since the nineteenth century. Scholars from the 1980s forward have divided the pre-Columbian period into the Ananatuba phase (c. 1100 – c. 200 BC), the Mangueiras phase (c. 1000 BC – c. 100 AD), the Formiga phase (c. 100-400 AD), the Marajoará phase (c. 400-1200 AD), and the Aruã phase (1200-1500 AD).

Since the 1990s, there has been debate over the origins and sophistication of Marajó&#x27;s pre-Columbian society. Based on fieldwork in the 1940s and 1950s, the archaeologist Betty Meggers initially argued that the Marajoara culture had been founded by emigrants from the Andes and that the society steadily declined until its final collapse at approximately 1400 AD, due to the Marajó&#x27;s poor soil fertility and other environmental factors. Megger&#x27;s hypotheses subsequently became associated with environmental determinism. Her theory has since been rejected, however, by the archaeologist Anna Curtenius Roosevelt, who re-excavated Marajó in the 1980s. According to Roosevelt, the Marajoara culture developed independently within the Amazon and featured both intensive subsistence agriculture and major public works.

Roosevelt estimated that Marajó may have had a population of more than 100,000 people at its peak. The population lived in homes with tamped earth floors, organized themselves into matrilineal clans, and divided tasks by sex, age, and skill level.

The arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century was catastrophic to the indigenous population of the island; 90% died due to high mortality from Eurasian infectious diseases; they lacked immunity against these diseases that had become endemic in Eurasian cities.

In contrast, however, during the 1918–1919 pandemic worldwide of Spanish influenza, Marajó was the only major populated area not to have any documented cases of the illness.

The island is also the location of the Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Marajó.

<doc id="626982" wikidata="Q151372" url="?curid=626982" title="3352 McAuliffe">
<text>3352 McAuliffe (), provisional designation , is a rare-type asteroid and suspected binary system, classified as near-Earth object of the Amor group, approximately 2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 6 February 1981, by American astronomer Norman Thomas at Lowell&#x27;s Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, Arizona, United States.

Originally, this asteroid was the target of the 1998 Deep Space 1 mission, but that mission was eventually rerouted to 9969 Braille. It was named in memory of Challenger crew member Christa McAuliffe.

== Orbit ==
McAuliffe orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–2.6 AU once every 2 years and 7 months (941 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.37 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic.

It has an &quot;Earth minimum orbital intersection distance&quot; of , which translates into 79.5 lunar distances. Due to its eccentric orbit, McAuliffe is also a Mars-crosser. As no precoveries were taken, and no prior identifications were made, the body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa in 1981.

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Spectral type ===
In the SMASS taxonomy, McAuliffe is a rare A-type asteroid, meaning that it is rich in olivine. In addition, the large-scale survey conducted by PanSTARRS also classified as a SQ-type, a transitional type between the common stony and Q-type asteroids, indicating the presence of pyroxene minerals.

=== Diameter and albedo ===
The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes an albedo of 0.18 and derives a diameter of 1.99 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 16.068, a figure previously obtained by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, and later revised by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec.

=== Rotation period ===
Between 1998 and 2016, several rotational lightcurves of McAuliffe were obtained from photometric observations taken by astronomers Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory, Czech Republic, by Andreas Howell at Willowcroft Observatory, Florida, as well as by Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory, Colorado, and at the Center for Solar System Studies, California. The best-rated lightcurve gave a rotation period of 2.206 to 2.212 hours with a brightness variation between 0.08 and 0.12 magnitude ().

=== Suspected moon ===
During the photometric observations in March 2012, Brian Warner found evidence of the existence of a minor-planet moon orbiting McAuliffe every 20.86 hours. However, it is only a &quot;possible&quot; synchronous binary system, as no mutual eclipsing/occultation events were observed. Follow-up observations in September and October 2016, did not confirm the binary nature of McAuliffe.

== Exploration ==
=== Deep Space 1 ===
McAuliffe, together with comet 76P/West–Kohoutek–Ikemura, were the original fly-by targets for the Deep Space 1 (DS1) mission. 
Launch was scheduled for 1 July 1998. A delay in the delivery of the spacecraft&#x27;s power electronics system as well as insufficient time to test the flight software caused the launch to be postponed to 24 October 1998. Due to this delay, new targets had to be selected.

In July 1999, DS1 passed the alternative target 9969 Braille at a distance of 15 kilometers. In January 2001, comet 107P/Wilson–Harrington was encountered, and in September 2001, short-period comet 19P/Borrelly was passed at distance of only 2,200 kilometers.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named in memory of Christa McAuliffe (1948–1986), teacher, civilian astronaut and one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster on 28 January 1986. The minor planets , , , , , and were named for the other crew members of the ill-fated STS-51-L mission. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 26 March 1986 ().

<doc id="626990" wikidata="Q1337449" url="?curid=626990" title="Prayer of Manasseh">
<text>The Prayer of Manasseh is a short, penitential prayer attributed to king Manasseh of Judah.

The majority of scholars believe that the Prayer of Manasseh was written in Greek (while a minority argues for a Semitic original) in the second or first century BC. It is recognised that it could also have been written in the first half of the 1st century AD, but in any case before the Destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD. Another work by the same title, written in Hebrew, was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q381:17).

==Origin==
Manasseh is recorded in the Bible as one of the most idolatrous kings of Judah (; ). The second Book of Chronicles, but not the second Book of Kings, records that Manasseh was taken captive by the Assyrians (). While a prisoner, Manasseh prayed for mercy, and upon being freed and restored to the throne turned from his idolatrous ways (). A reference to a penitential prayer, but not the prayer itself, is made in , which says that the prayer is written in &quot;the annals of the kings of Israel&quot;.

==Canonicity==
The prayer&#x27;s canonicity is disputed. It appears in ancient Syriac, Old Slavonic, Ethiopic, and Armenian translations. In the Ethiopian Bible, the prayer is found in 2 Chronicles. The earliest Greek text is the fifth-century &quot;Codex Alexandrinus&quot;. A Hebrew manuscript of the prayer was found in Cairo Geniza. It is considered apocryphal by Jews, Catholics and Protestants. It was placed at the end of 2 Chronicles in the late 4th-century Vulgate. Over a millennium later, Martin Luther included the prayer in his 74-book translation of the Bible into German. It was part of the 1537 Matthew Bible, and the 1599 Geneva Bible. It also appears in the Apocrypha of the 1611 King James Bible and of the original 1609/1610 Douai-Rheims Bible. Pope Clement VIII included the prayer in an appendix to the Vulgate.

The prayer is included in some editions of the Greek Septuagint. For example, the 5th century Codex Alexandrinus includes the prayer among fourteen Odes appearing just after the Psalms. It is accepted as a deuterocanonical book by Orthodox Christians.

==Liturgical use==

The prayer is chanted during the Eastern Orthodox Christian and Byzantine Catholic service of Great Compline. It is used in the Roman Rite as part of the Responsory after the first reading in the Office of Readings on the 14th Sunday in Ordinary Time (along with Psalm 51). In the Extraordinary Form, in the Roman Rite Breviary; in the corpus of responsories sung with the readings from the books of Kings between Trinity Sunday and August, the seventh cites the Prayer of Manasseh, together with verses of Psalm 50, the penitential Psalm par excellence. It is used also as a canticle in the Daily Office of the 1979 U.S. Book of Common Prayer used by the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and as Canticle 52 in Common Worship: Daily Prayer of the Church of England.

<text>The state flag of Tatarstan, a republic of Russia, was introduced in 1991.

== History ==
The Supreme Council of the Tatar Soviet Socialist Republic adopted the flag on 29 November 1991 in its present form. It was designed by T.G. Khaziakhmetov (Tawil Xaciəxmətov).

The Tatar Encyclopedia states: &quot;The flag is a state symbol that expresses the sovereignty of the Republic of Tatarstan, the identity and traditions of the people of Tatarstan. The national flag of the Republic of Tatarstan consists of a rectangular panel with horizontal stripes of green, white and red. The white stripe is 1/15 of the flag&#x27;s width and is located between equal-width stripes of green and red. The green stripe is at the top. The ratio of the flag&#x27;s width to its length is 1:2.&quot;

According to official explanation;

* Red band symbolizes fight for happiness, bravery and courage
* White band symbolizes peace, concord and honest future
* Green band symbolizes hope, freedom and wealth.

Tatar nationalists such as the All-Tatar Public Center use a different flag, divided diagonally by red and green and containing a white star and crescent in the center.

<text>Michael Harrison Sweet (born July 4, 1963) is an American musician; he is the co-founder, songwriter, guitarist and lead singer of the metal band Stryper. He has also had a successful solo career and served as singer and guitarist for Boston from 2007 to 2011.

==Stryper==

In the early 1980s, Sweet and his brother started a band called Roxx Regime and played in small venues. They were a trio for a period of time with Sweet being the only guitar player in the band. This band would later become Stryper. The band challenged the stereotype of heavy metal being satanic and took Christian rock into mainstream.

With the band, Sweet was not only the lead vocalist and shared lead guitar duties, but he also wrote most of the music for the band as well as co-producing and arranging the music. The band recorded five successful studio albums. The band&#x27;s reputation declined in the 1990s.

==Solo==
After nine years as the lead singer/lead guitarist of Stryper, Sweet left the band in 1992 in order to pursue a solo career. He first released a demo album, &quot;Unstryped&quot;, which featured several songs allegedly intended for the band. Sweet later included some of these on his first full-length album.

His self-titled debut album was released in 1994 and sold over 250,000 copies. He followed it with a slightly softer album titled &quot;Real&quot; in 1996 earning him a Dove Award nomination. Soon after the release of &quot;Real&quot;, Sweet left Benson Records, with whom he had released the two albums.

During this time, Sweet and his wife Kyle moved to Massachusetts, where Sweet worked at his father-in-law&#x27;s campground/cranberry business, Maple Park. In 1998, he released an independent demo album titled &quot;Truth&quot; which received critical acclaim. He was signed to Restless Records and re-released &quot;Truth&quot; in 2000 with a new song-list and new artwork.

On August 19, 2007, Sweet was asked by Boston&#x27;s Tom Scholz to be one of the lead singers and guitarists for &quot;Come Together: A Tribute to the Life of Brad Delp&quot; at the Bank of America Pavilion in Boston. Scholz then asked Sweet to join Boston for the band&#x27;s summer 2008 tour with Styx as the opening act.

==Boston==
Sweet performed lead vocals, background vocals, and guitar work for Boston. Sweet was asked to be a part of what was supposed to be Boston&#x27;s last performance on August 19, 2007. It was a benefit and tribute show and names such as Sammy Hagar, Mickey Thomas and Ann Wilson were among the invited guests. Tom Scholz was moved by what Sweet had written about the late Brad Delp and then heard Sweet sing and play guitar. Scholz was so impressed with Sweet&#x27;s talents that he invited him to join the band and become a permanent member. Boston began booking a tour for 2008 with Styx as the opening act. Sweet handled lead vocals on roughly half of the set list and played guitar for the entire set and handled solo work as well. In August 2011, it was announced that Sweet had left Boston to focus on his priorities and contributions to Stryper.

==Stryper reunion==

In 1999, Sweet reunited with former Stryper bandmates Oz Fox and Tim Gaines during a concert in Puerto Rico. The concert featured Fox and Gaines&#x27;s band, SinDizzy. Sweet was invited as a solo artist. The three of them got together for a set of four songs. The next year, the first Stryper Expo was held in New Jersey and the entire line-up was reunited again.

Although original bassist, Tim Gaines, left the group in 2005 and was replaced by Tracy Ferrie, the band has continued to work together, releasing a new album titled &quot;Reborn&quot;, produced by Sweet. However, he has continued with his solo career as well. In August 2006, he released a solo album titled &quot;Him&quot; which features traditional hymns re-written and arranged by Sweet. The band then released the album &quot;Murder by Pride&quot;, produced by Sweet in July 2009. Perry Richardson who is formerly of the band Firehouse is now the bassist for the band. Perry has brought a new life into the band and they are currently touring and planning a new studio album to be released in 2020.

In 2007, Sweet released an album called &quot;Touched&quot; in honor of his wife, Kyle, who died on March 5, 2009, after a two-year battle with ovarian cancer.

In September 2009, Stryper embarked on its 25th anniversary world tour, &quot;Rocking the Hell Out of You for 25 years&quot; with the original members. The tour included two opening bands: Manic Drive and Flight Patterns, the latter which includes Sweet&#x27;s son, Michael Sweet Jr.

On February 15, 2011, Stryper released a new record entitled &quot;The Covering&quot;, produced by Sweet.

In 2013, Stryper released two studio albums, &quot;Second Coming&quot; and &quot;No More Hell to Pay&quot; via Frontiers Records. They released a live album and DVD, &quot;Stryper: Live at the Whiskey&quot;, recorded in 2013 at the Whisky a Go Go on the Sunset Strip recorded from November 2013. Sweet has also worked with Lynch Mob founder and former Dokken member George Lynch on recording an album, &quot;Only to Rise&quot;, released under the name Sweet &amp; Lynch. Sweet discussed the group on Eddie Trunk Podcast dated February 4, 2015. The group also consists of former White Lion and former Megadeth member James LoMenzo on bass, and former Whitesnake and former Foreigner member Brian Tichy on drums. &quot;Only to Rise&quot; was released on January 27, 2015.

Aside from Stryper developing their new album, &quot;Fallen&quot;, Sweet has confirmed he has signed with Rat Pak Records to release a new solo album in early 2016, &quot;One Sided War&quot;.

During an interview with Antihero Magazine in November 2016, Sweet confirmed that he is recording another Sweet &amp; Lynch album titled &quot;Unified&quot; which released November 2017. Since then, Sweet has gone on record stating Sweet &amp; Lynch may have run its course citing Lynch&#x27;s hands in many different projects has not allowed them to tour to promote the albums, the way Sweet would have liked, and he feels he has to do most of the promoting himself.

Sweet, as a member of Stryper, released &quot;God Damn Evil&quot; on April 20, 2018. Due to its album title, it was deemed offensive and garnered a &quot;parental guidance&quot; label and was banned from Walmart. Despite this controversy the album sold and charted well with most major music indexes. Perry Richardson did not perform on the album but toured in support of the album.

Sweet released his tenth studio album, &quot;Ten&quot;, on RatPak Records in late 2019.

Sweet also participated as guitarist, lead singer and producer on Stryper&#x27;s &quot;Even the Devil Believes&quot; that was released on September 4, 2020.

==Personal life==

Sweet met his wife Kyle while making Stryper&#x27;s first video. They were married for 22 years and had two children together. In 2009, Kyle died after a two-year battle with cancer.

On January 8, 2010, Michael married Lisa Champagne.

<text>A skyhook is a proposed momentum exchange tether that aims to reduce the cost of placing payloads into low Earth orbit. A heavy orbiting station is connected to a cable which extends down towards the upper atmosphere. Payloads, which are much lighter than the station, are hooked to the end of the cable as it passes, and are then flung into orbit by rotation of the cable around the center of mass. The station can then be reboosted to its original altitude by electromagnetic propulsion, rocket propulsion, or by deorbiting another object with the same kinetic energy as transferred to the payload.

A skyhook differs from a geostationary orbit space elevator in that a skyhook would be much shorter and would not come in contact with the surface of the Earth. A skyhook would require a suborbital launch vehicle to reach its lower end, while a space elevator would not.

==History==

Different synchronous non-rotating orbiting skyhook concepts and versions have been proposed, starting with Isaacs in 1966, Artsutanov in 1967, Pearson and Colombo in 1975, Kalaghan in 1978, and Braginski in 1985. The versions with the best potential involve a much shorter tether in low Earth orbit, which rotates in its orbital plane and whose ends brush the upper Earth atmosphere, with the rotational motion cancelling the orbital motion at ground level. These &quot;rotating&quot; skyhook versions were proposed by Moravec in 1976, and Sarmont in 1994.

This resulted in a Shuttle-based tether system: the TSS-1R mission, launched 22 February 1996 on STS-75 that focused in characterizing basic space tether behavior and space plasma physics. The Italian satellite was deployed to a distance of from the Space Shuttle.

Sarmont theorized in 1994 that the skyhook could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator.

In 2000 and 2001, Boeing Phantom Works, with a grant from NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, performed a detailed study of the engineering and commercial feasibility of various skyhook designs. They studied in detail a specific variant of this concept, called &quot;Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch System&quot; or HASTOL. This design called for a hypersonic ramjet or scramjet aircraft to intercept a rotating hook while flying at Mach 10.

In 2007, a student-built satellite called Young Engineers&#x27; Satellite 2 (YES2), part of ESA&#x27;s Foton-M3 microgravity mission, deployed a 31.7 km tether. This was the longest tether ever deployed in space and officially set the Guinness world record

While no skyhook has yet been built, there have been a number of flight experiments exploring various aspects of the space tether concept in general.

==Rotating skyhook==

By rotating the tether around the orbiting center of mass in a direction opposite to the orbital motion, the speed of the hook relative to the ground can be reduced. This reduces the required strength of the tether, and makes coupling easier.

The rotation of the tether can be made to exactly match the orbital speed (around 7–8 km/s). In this configuration, the hook would trace out a path similar to a cardioid. From the point of view of the ground, the hook would appear to descend almost vertically, come to a halt, and then ascend again. This configuration minimises aerodynamic drag, and thus allows the hook to descend deep into the atmosphere. However, according to the HASTOL study, a skyhook of this kind in Earth orbit would require a very large counterweight, on the order of 1000–2000 times the mass of the payload, and the tether would need to be mechanically reeled in after collecting each payload in order to maintain synchronization between the tether rotation and its orbit.

Phase I of Boeing&#x27;s Hypersonic Airplane Space Tether Orbital Launch (HASTOL) study, published in 2000, proposed a 600 km-long tether, in an equatorial orbit at 610–700 km altitude, rotating with a tip speed of 3.5 km/s. This would give the tip a ground speed of 3.6 km/s (Mach 10), which would be matched by a hypersonic airplane carrying the payload module, with transfer at an altitude of 100 km. The tether would be made of existing commercially available materials: mostly Spectra 2000 (a kind of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene), except for the outer 20 km which would be made of heat-resistant Zylon PBO. With a nominal payload mass of 14 tonnes, the Spectra/Zylon tether would weigh 1300 tonnes, or 90 times the mass of the payload. The authors stated:
The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is: &quot;We don&#x27;t need magic materials like &#x27;Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes&#x27; to make the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.&quot;
The second phase of the HASTOL study, published in 2001, proposed increasing the intercept airspeed to Mach 15–17, and increasing the intercept altitude to 150 km, which would reduce the necessary tether mass by a factor of three. The higher speed would be achieved by using a reusable rocket stage instead of a purely air-breathing aircraft. The study concluded that although there are no &quot;fundamental technical show-stoppers&quot;, substantial improvement in technology would be needed. In particular, there was concern that a bare Spectra 2000 tether would be rapidly eroded by atomic oxygen; this component was given a technology readiness level of 2.

== Similar concepts ==
The capture-ejector rim is a variation that consists of a rim- or ring-shaped structure. Like a rotating skyhook, it would rotate in a direction opposite to its orbital motion, allowing a spacecraft at suborbital velocity to attach to its lower portion and later be flung into orbit from its upper portion. It would be easier for a spacecraft to attach to the lower portion of a capture-ejector rim than to attach to the end of a skyhook (which would only point downwards for a brief period of time).

<doc id="627009" wikidata="Q192470" url="?curid=627009" title="Potassium cyanide">
<text>Potassium cyanide is a compound with the formula KCN. It is a colorless salt, similar in appearance to sugar, that is highly soluble in water. Most KCN is used in gold mining, organic synthesis, and electroplating. Smaller applications include jewellery for chemical gilding and buffing. Potassium cyanide is highly toxic, and a dose of 200 to 300 milligrams will kill nearly any human.

The moist solid emits small amounts of hydrogen cyanide due to hydrolysis (reaction with water). Hydrogen cyanide is often described as having an odor resembling that of bitter almonds.

The taste of potassium cyanide has been described as acrid and bitter, with a burning sensation similar to lye.

==Production==
KCN is produced by treating hydrogen cyanide with an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, followed by evaporation of the solution in a vacuum:
About 50,000 tons of potassium cyanide are produced yearly. For laboratory purpose it is easier to pass hydrogen cyanide through an alcoholic solution of potassium base because the crystals of potassium cyanide are not soluble in alcohol .

===Historical production===
Before 1900 and the invention of the Castner process, potassium cyanide was the most important source of alkali metal cyanides. In this historical process, potassium cyanide was produced by decomposing potassium ferrocyanide:

==Structure==
In aqueous solution, KCN is dissociated into hydrated potassium (K+) ions and cyanide (CN−) ions. As a solid, KCN has structure resembling sodium chloride: with each potassium ion surrounded by six cyanide ions, and vice versa. Despite being diatomic, and thus less symmetric than chloride, the cyanide ions rotate so rapidly that their time-averaged shape is spherical. At low temperature and high pressure, this free rotation is hindered, resulting in a less symmetric crystal structure with the cyanide ions arranged in sheets. 
==Applications==
KCN and sodium cyanide (NaCN) are widely used in organic synthesis for the preparation of nitriles and carboxylic acids, particularly in the von Richter reaction. It also finds use for the synthesis of hydantoins, which can be useful synthetic intermediates, when reacted with a carbonyl compound such as an aldehyde or ketone in the presence of ammonium carbonate.

KCN is used as a photographic fixer in the wet plate collodion process. The KCN dissolves silver where it has not been made insoluble by the developer. This reveals and stabilizes the image, making it no longer sensitive to light. Modern wet plate photographers may prefer less toxic fixers, often opting for sodium thiosulfate, but KCN is still used.
In the 19th century, cyanogen soap, a preparation containing potassium cyanide, was used by photographers to remove silver stains from their hands.

===Potassium gold cyanide===

In gold mining, KCN forms the water-soluble salt potassium gold cyanide (or gold potassium cyanide) and potassium hydroxide from gold metal in the presence of oxygen (usually from the surrounding air) and water:
:4 Au + 8 KCN + O2 + 2 H2O → 4 K[Au(CN)2] + 4 KOH

A similar process uses NaCN to produce sodium gold cyanide (NaAu(CN2)).

=== Analytical chemistry ===
In analytical chemistry, potassium cyanide is used as complexing agent for chemical analysis of zinc in water and wastewater. The cyanide group complexes zinc and other heavy metals, which is later extracted and analyzed in a spectro-photometer.

==Toxicity==

Potassium cyanide is a potent inhibitor of cellular respiration, acting on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, hence blocking oxidative phosphorylation. Lactic acidosis then occurs as a consequence of anaerobic metabolism. Initially, acute cyanide poisoning causes a red or ruddy complexion in the victim because the tissues are not able to use the oxygen in the blood. The effects of potassium cyanide and sodium cyanide are identical, and symptoms of poisoning typically occur within a few minutes of ingesting the substance: the person loses consciousness, and brain death eventually follows. During this period the victim may suffer convulsions. Death is caused by histotoxic hypoxia/cerebral hypoxia. The expected LD100 dose (human) for potassium cyanide is 200–300 mg while the median lethal dose LD50 is estimated at 140 mg.

People who killed themselves, were killed, or killed someone else using potassium cyanide include:
* Viktor Meyer, 19th-century German chemist, died by suicide in 1897 after taking cyanide
* Gustav Wied, Danish novelist, poet, and playwright, in 1914
* Pritilata Waddedar, an Indian revolutionary nationalist, took cyanide in 1932 to avoid capture by Indian Imperial Police, British India
* Badal Gupta, a revolutionary from Bengal, who launched an attack on the Writers&#x27; Building in Kolkata, consumed cyanide in 1930 immediately after the attack.
* Wallace Carothers, polymer chemist who died by suicide in 1937 after battling depression for years
* Senior figures in Nazi Germany, such as Erwin Rommel, Hitler&#x27;s longtime companion Eva Braun, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, and Hermann Göring
* Alan Turing, a computer scientist who died of cyanide poisoning in 1954
* Ronald Clark O&#x27;Bryan, a Texas optician who killed his son by lacing a pixy stick with potassium cyanide in 1974
* Peoples Temple, the 1978 cult suicide in (Jonestown), Guyana
* Members of the LTTE involved in the assassination of Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991
* Ramon Sampedro, Spanish tetraplegic and activist whose assisted suicide in 1998 provoked a national debate about euthanasia, and was the subject of the Oscar-winning film &quot;The Sea Inside&quot;
* Jason Altom, a promising graduate student in the lab of Nobel Prize–winning chemist EJ Corey at Harvard, died after drinking potassium cyanide in 1998
* Slobodan Praljak, a wartime general in Republic of Croatia, died by suicide by drinking from a vial containing potassium cyanide during the reading of his appeal judgment in The Hague on International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on 29 November 2017.

It is used by professional entomologists as a killing agent in collecting jars, as insects succumb within seconds to the HCN fumes it emits, thereby minimizing damage to even highly fragile specimens.

KCN can be detoxified most efficiently with hydrogen peroxide or with a solution of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Such solutions should be kept alkaline whenever possible so as to eliminate the possibility of generation of hydrogen cyanide:
: KCN + H2O2 → KOCN + H2O
: KCN + NaOCl → KOCN + NaCl

<text>The State Anthem of the Republic of Tatarstan was composed by Tatar musician Röstäm Yaxin and was first adopted in 1993 without lyrics. 20 years later, lyrics written by were made official.

==Lyrics==
===Current version===
On 21 February 2013, the Parliament of Tatarstan unanimously approved lyrics written by Baytimerov. The final lyrics of the anthem is based on the poem «Туган ягым» (&#x27;Native Land&#x27;) by Ramazan Baytimerov, as is known from a story written by him in the 1970s. Many unknown authors took part in the revision of the poems. Baytimerov&#x27;s poems inspired the composer Röstäm Yaxin to compose a song, the melody of which became the national anthem of Tatarstan in 1993. The new lyrics of the anthem consists of the first two verses sung in Tatar, followed by two verses sung in Russian. The lyrics were translated into Russian by Assyrian-Russian poet Filipp Pirayev.


=== Original version ===
The original proposed lyrics of the anthem, titled &quot;&quot; (), was written by Ramazan Baytimerov in the 1970s. The text was subsequently translated into Russian by Marsel Sabirov. During that time, Röstäm Yaxin was inspired to composed music that eventually became the national anthem. The Russian version, however, was not adopted.

<text>3318 Blixen, provisionally designated , is a stony Eoan asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 23 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Danish astronomers Poul Jensen and Karl Augustesen at Brorfelde Observatory on 23 April 1985.

Blixen is a member of the Eos family (), the largest asteroid family in the outer main belt consisting of nearly 10,000 asteroids. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.9–3.2 AU once every 5 years and 3 months (1,905 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic.

Photometric observations of this asteroid collected during 2006 show a rotation period of 6.456 ± 0.003 hours with a brightness variation of 0.20 ± 0.02 magnitude.

This minor planet was named after Danish novelist Karen Blixen (1885–1962), best known for the memoir &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 September 1986 ().

<text>The Webley Revolver (also known as the Webley Top-Break Revolver or Webley Self-Extracting Revolver) was, in various designations, a standard issue service revolver for the armed forces of the United Kingdom, and countries of the British Empire, from 1887 to 1963.

The Webley is a top-break revolver and breaking the revolver operates the extractor, which removes cartridges from the cylinder. The Webley Mk I service revolver was adopted in 1887 and the Mk IV rose to prominence during the Boer War of 1899–1902. The Mk VI was introduced in 1915, during wartime, and is the best-known model.

Firing large .455 Webley cartridges, Webley service revolvers are among the most powerful top-break revolvers produced. The .455 calibre Webley is no longer in military service. , the .38/200 Webley Mk IV variant was still in use as a police sidearm in a number of countries.

==History==
Webley &amp; Scott (P. Webley &amp; Son before merger with W &amp; C Scott in 1897) produced a range of revolvers from the mid 19th to late 20th centuries. As early as 1853 P. Webley and J. Webley began production of their first patented single action cap and ball revolvers. Later under the trade name of P. Webley and Son, manufacturing included their own calibre rim-fire solid frame revolver as well as licensed copies of Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s Tip up break action revolvers. The quintessential hinged frame, centre-fire revolvers for which the Webley name is best known first began production/development in the early 1870s most notably with the Webley-Pryse (1877) and Webley-Kaufman (1881) models.

The W.G. or Webley-Government models produced from 1885 through to the early 1900s, are the most popular of the commercial top break revolvers and many were the private purchase choice of British military officers and target shooters in the period, coming in a .476/.455 calibre. Other short-barrel solid-frame revolvers, including the Webley RIC (Royal Irish Constabulary) model and the British Bulldog revolver, designed to be carried in a coat pocket for self-defence were far more commonplace during the period. Today, the best-known are the range of military revolvers, which were in service use in two World Wars and numerous colonial conflicts.

In 1887, the British Army was searching for a revolver to replace the largely unsatisfactory .476 Enfield Mk I &amp; Mk II revolvers, the Enfield having only replaced the solid frame Adams .450 revolver which was a late 1860s conversion of the cap and ball Beaumont–Adams revolver in 1880. Webley &amp; Scott, who were already very well known makers of quality guns and had sold many pistols on a commercial basis to military officers and civilians alike, tendered the .455 calibre Webley Self-Extracting Revolver for trials. The military was suitably impressed with the revolver (it was seen as a vast improvement over the Enfield revolvers then in service, as the American-designed Owen extraction system did not prove particularly satisfactory), and it was adopted on 8 November 1887 as the &quot;Pistol, Webley, Mk I&quot;. The initial contract called for 10,000 Webley revolvers, at a price of £3/1/1 each, with at least 2,000 revolvers to be supplied within eight months.

The Webley revolver went through a number of changes, culminating in the Mk VI, which was in production between 1915 and 1923. The large .455 Webley revolvers were retired in 1947, although the Webley Mk IV .38/200 remained in service until 1963 alongside the Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolver. Commercial versions of all Webley service revolvers were also sold on the civilian market, along with a number of similar designs (such as the Webley-Government and Webley-Wilkinson) that were not officially adopted for service, but were nonetheless purchased privately by military officers. Webley&#x27;s records show the last Mk VI was sold from the factory in 1957, with &quot;Nigeria&quot; noted against the entry.



==In military service==
===Boer War===
The Webley Mk IV, chambered in .455 Webley, was introduced in 1899 and soon became known as the &quot;Boer War Model&quot;, on account of the large numbers of officers and non-commissioned officers who purchased it on their way to take part in the conflict. The Webley Mk IV served alongside a large number of other handguns, including the Mauser C96 &quot;Broomhandle&quot; (as used by Winston Churchill during the War), earlier Beaumont–Adams cartridge revolvers, and other top-break revolvers manufactured by gunmakers such as William Tranter, and Kynoch.

===First World War===
The standard-issue Webley revolver at the outbreak of the First World War was the Webley Mk V (adopted 9 December 1913), but there were considerably more Mk IV revolvers in service in 1914, as the initial order for 20,000 Mk V revolvers had not been completed when hostilities began. They were issued first to officers, pipers and range takers, and later to airmen, naval crews, boarding parties, trench raiders, machine-gun teams, and tank crews. They were then issued to many Allied soldiers as a sidearm. The Mk VI proved to be a very reliable and hardy weapon, well suited to the mud and adverse conditions of trench warfare, and several accessories were developed for the Mk VI, including a bayonet (made from a converted French Gras bayonet), speedloader devices (the &quot;Prideaux Device&quot; and the Watson design), and a stock allowing for the revolver to be converted into a carbine.

Demand exceeded production, which was already behind as the war began. This forced the British
government to buy substitute weapons chambered in .455 Webley from neutral countries. America provided the Smith &amp; Wesson 2nd Model &quot;Hand Ejector&quot; and Colt New Service Revolvers. Spanish gunsmiths in Eibar made acceptable copies of popular guns and were chosen to close the gap cheaply by making a .455 variant of their 11mm &quot;M1884&quot; or &quot;S&amp;W Model 7 ONÁ&quot; revolver, a copy of the Smith &amp; Wesson &quot;.44 Double Action First Model&quot;. The &quot;Pistol, Revolver, Old Pattern, No. 1 Mk. 1&quot; was by Garate, Anitua y Cia. and the &quot;Pistol, Revolver, Old Pattern, No.2 Mk.1&quot; was by Trocaola, Aranzabal y Cia. Orbea Hermanos y Cia. made 10,000 pistols. Rexach &amp; Urgoite was tapped for an initial order of 500 revolvers, but they were rejected due to defects.

===Second World War===
The official service pistol for the British military during the Second World War was the Enfield No. 2 Mk I .38/200 calibre revolver. Owing to a critical shortage of handguns, a number of other weapons were also adopted (first practically, then officially) to alleviate the shortage. As a result, both the Webley Mk IV in .38/200 and Webley Mk VI in .455 calibre were issued to personnel during the war.

===Post-war use===
The Webley Mk VI (.455) and Mk IV (.38/200) revolvers were still issued to British and Commonwealth forces after the Second World War; there were now extensive stockpiles of the revolvers in military stores, yet they suffered from ammunition shortages. This lack of ammunition was instrumental in keeping the Enfield and Webley revolvers in use so long: they were not wearing out because they were not being used. An armourer stationed in West Germany joked by the time they were officially retired in 1963, the ammunition allowance was &quot;two cartridges per man, per year.&quot;

The Webley Mk IV .38 revolver was not completely replaced by the Browning Hi-Power until 1963, and saw use in the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, Malayan Emergency and the Rhodesian Bush War. Many Enfield No. 2 Mk I revolvers were still circulating in British military service as late as 1970.

===Police use===
The Royal Hong Kong Police and Singapore Police Force were issued Webley Mk III &amp; Mk IV (38S&amp;W then.38/200) revolvers from the 1930s. Singaporean police (and some other &quot;officials&quot;) Webleys were equipped with safety catches, a rather unusual feature in a revolver. These were gradually retired in the 1970s as they came in for repair, and were replaced with Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 .38 revolvers. The London Metropolitan Police were also known to use Webley revolvers, as were most colonial police units until just after the Second World War. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Shanghai Municipal Police received Webley Mk VI revolvers during the interwar period. 

The Ordnance Factory Board of India still manufactures .380 Revolver Mk IIz cartridges, as well as a .32 calibre revolver (the IOF .32 Revolver) with barrel which is clearly based on the Webley Mk IV .38 service pistol.

===Military service .455 Webley revolver marks and models===
There were six different marks of .455 calibre Webley British Government Model revolvers approved for British military service at various times between 1887 and the end of the First World War:
* Mk I: The first Webley self-extracting revolver adopted for service, officially adopted 8 November 1887, with a barrel and &quot;bird&#x27;s beak&quot; style grips. Mk I* was a factory upgrade of Mk I revolvers to match the Mk II.
* Mk II: Similar to the Mk I, with modifications to the hammer and grip shape, as well as a hardened steel shield for the blast-shield. Officially adopted 21 May 1895, with a barrel.
* Mk III: Identical to Mk II, but with modifications to the cylinder cam and related parts. Officially adopted 5 October 1897, most not issued, with exception of a number that were marked with the &quot;broad arrow&quot; acceptance stamp on the top strap. These few went to the Royal Navy.
* Mk IV: The &quot;Boer War&quot; Model. Manufactured using much higher quality steel and case hardened parts, with the cylinder axis being a fixed part of the barrel and modifications to various other parts, including a re-designed blast-shield. Officially adopted 21 July 1899, with a barrel.
* Mk V: Similar to the Mk IV, but with cylinders wider to allow for the use of nitrocellulose propellant-based cartridges. Officially adopted 9 December 1913, with a barrel, although some models produced in 1915 had and barrels.
* Mk VI: Similar to the Mk V, but with a squared-off &quot;target&quot; style grip (as opposed to the &quot;bird&#x27;s-beak&quot; style found on earlier marks and models) and a barrel. Officially adopted 24 May 1915, and also manufactured by RSAF Enfield under the designation Pistol, Revolver, Webley, No. 1 Mk VI 1921–1926.

==The Webley Mk IV .38/200 Service Revolver==
At the end of the First World War, the British military decided that the .455 calibre gun and cartridge was too large for modern military use and concluded after numerous tests and extensive trials, that a pistol in .38 calibre firing a 200-grain (13 g) bullet would be just as effective as the .455 for stopping an enemy.

Webley &amp; Scott immediately tendered the .38/200 calibre Webley Mk IV revolver, which as well as being nearly identical in appearance to the .455 calibre Mk VI revolver (albeit scaled down for the smaller cartridge), was based on their .38 calibre Webley Mk III pistol, designed for the police and civilian markets. (The .38 Webley Mk III used black powder cartridges, as did the .455 Webley Mk IV; they should not be fired with the smokeless powder cartridges developed for the .38 Webley Mk IV and .455 Webley Mk V and Mk VI.)

Much to their surprise, the British Government took the design to the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock, which came up with a revolver that was externally very similar looking to the .38/200 calibre Webley Mk IV, but was internally different enough that no parts from the Webley could be used in the Enfield and vice versa.

The Enfield-designed pistol was quickly accepted under the designation &quot;Pistol, Revolver, No. 2 Mk I&quot;, and was adopted in 1932, followed in 1938 by the Mk I* (spurless hammer, double action only), and finally the Mk I** (simplified for wartime production) in 1942.

Webley &amp; Scott sued the British Government over the incident, claiming £2250 as &quot;costs involved in the research and design&quot; of the revolver.

This was contested by RSAF Enfield, which quite firmly stated that the Enfield No. 2 Mk I was designed by Captain Boys (the Assistant Superintendent of Design, later of Boys Anti-Tank Rifle fame) with assistance from Webley &amp; Scott, and not the other way around. Accordingly, their claim was denied.

By way of compensation, the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors eventually awarded Webley &amp; Scott £1250 for their work.

RSAF Enfield proved unable to manufacture enough No. 2 revolvers to meet the military&#x27;s wartime demands, and as a result Webley&#x27;s Mk IV was also widely used within the British Army in World War Two.

==Other Webley revolvers==
Whilst the top-break, self-extracting revolvers used by the British and other Commonwealth militaries are the best-known examples of Webley revolvers, the company produced a number of other highly popular revolvers largely intended for the police and civilian markets.

===Webley RIC===


The Webley RIC (Royal Irish Constabulary) model was Webley&#x27;s first double-action revolver, and adopted by the RIC in 1868, hence the name. It was a solid frame, gate-loaded revolver, chambered in .442 Webley. General George Armstrong Custer was known to have owned a pair, which he is believed to have used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.

A small number of early examples were produced in the huge .500 Tranter calibre, and later models were available chambered for the .450 Adams and other cartridges. They were also widely copied in Belgium.

===British Bull Dog===
The British Bull Dog model was an enormously successful solid-frame design introduced by Webley in 1872. It featured a barrel and was chambered for five .44 Short Rimfire, .442 Webley, or .450 Adams cartridges. (Webley later added smaller scaled five chambered versions in .320 and .380 calibres, but did not mark them British Bull Dog.) A .44 calibre Belgian-made British Bulldog revolver was used to assassinate US President James Garfield on 2 July 1881 by Charles Guiteau.

It was designed to be carried in a coat pocket or kept on a bedside table, and many have survived to the present day in good condition, having seen little actual use. Numerous copies of this design were made during the late 19th century in Belgium, with smaller numbers also produced in Spain, France and the US. They remained reasonably popular until the Second World War, but are now generally sought after only as collectors&#x27; pieces, since ammunition for them is for the most part no longer commercially manufactured.

===Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver===
A highly unusual example of an &quot;automatic revolver&quot;, the Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver was produced between 1900 and 1915, and available in both a six-shot .455 Webley version, and an eight-shot .38 ACP (not to be confused with .380 ACP) version.
Unusually for a revolver, the Webley-Fosbery had a safety catch, and the light trigger pull and reputation for accuracy ensured that the Webley-Fosbery remained popular with target shooters long after production had finished.

<doc id="627021" wikidata="Q5757681" url="?curid=627021" title="High rising terminal">
<text>The high rising terminal (HRT), also known as rising inflection, upspeak, uptalk, or high rising intonation (HRI), is a feature of some variants of English where declarative sentences can end with a rising pitch similar to that typically found in yes–no questions. HRT has been claimed to be especially common among younger speakers and women, though its exact sociolinguistic implications are an ongoing subject of research.

== Intonational characteristics==

Empirically, one report proposes that HRT in American English and Australian English is marked by a high tone (high pitch or high fundamental frequency) beginning on the final accented syllable near the end of the statement (the terminal), and continuing to increase in frequency (up to 40%) to the end of the intonational phrase. New research suggests that the actual rise can occur one or more syllables after the last accented syllable of the phrase, and its range is much more variable than previously thought.

== Usage ==
In the United States, the phenomenon of HRT may be fairly recent but is an increasingly common characteristic of speech especially among younger speakers. However, serious scientific and linguistic inquiry on this topic has a much more extensive history in linguistic journals from Australia, New Zealand, and Britain where HRT seems to have been noted as early as World War II.

It has been noted in speech heard in areas of Canada, in Cape Town, the Falkland Islands, and in the United States where it is often associated with a particular sociolect that originated among affluent teenage girls in southern California (see Valleyspeak and Valley girl). It was observed in Mississippi in 1963 (see &quot;Twirling at Ole Miss&quot; in &quot;Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes&quot;). Elsewhere in the United States, this tonal pattern is characteristic of the speech heard in parts of the rural upper Midwest that have come under the influence of Norwegian phonology through Norwegian migration to Minnesota and North Dakota.

Although it is characterized in Britain as &quot;Australian question intonation&quot; (AQI) and blamed on the popularity of Australian soap operas among teenagers, HRT is also a feature of several Irish-English dialects, especially in mid-Ulster and Belfast English.

Research published in 1986, regarding vernacular speech in Sydney, suggested that high rising terminal was used more than twice as often by young people than older people, and was more common among women than men. In other words, HRT was more common among women born between 1950 and 1970, than among men born before 1950. The same research (and other sources) also suggested that the practice often served to discourage interruption, by indicating that a speaker had not quite completed a particular statement.

High rising terminal also occurs in non-English languages, such as in Arabic (Iraqi Arabic, Egyptian Arabic and Lebanese Arabic), Amharic, Cham, Tuvaluan, and Dominican and other varieties of Spanish.

== Effects ==
Media in Australia, Britain, and the United States have negatively portrayed the usage of HRT, claiming that its use exhibits a speaker&#x27;s insecurities about the statement and undermines effective speaking. &quot;Time&quot; reports that it hampers job interviews. However, other research has suggested HRT can be an effective way for speakers to establish common ground, that this often involves breathy voice, 
and that its meaning is highly situational, derived from a &quot;complex interaction of time, presupposition, and inference.&quot; 
Recent evidence shows that leaders of the peer group are more likely to use HRT in their declaratives than the junior members of the particular peer group. According to University of Pennsylvania phonologist Mark Liberman, George W. Bush began to use HRT extensively in his speeches as his presidency continued. Linguist Robin Lakoff drew attention to the pattern in her book &quot;Language and Women&#x27;s Place&quot;, which argued that women were socialized to talk in ways that lacked power, authority, and confidence. Rising intonation on declarative sentences was one of the features Lakoff included in her description of &quot;women&#x27;s language&quot;, a gendered speech style she believed reflected and reproduced its users&#x27; subordinate social status.

==Implications for gender==

Because HRT has been popularized as &quot;Valley Girl Speak&quot;, it has acquired an almost exclusively feminine gender connotation. Studies confirm that more women use HRT than men. Linguist Thomas J. Linneman contends, &quot;The more successful a man is, the less likely he is to use HRT; the more successful a woman is, the more likely she is to use uptalk.&quot; Though women appear to use HRT more often than men, the differences in frequency are not significant enough to brand HRT as an exclusively female speech pattern. Susan Miller, a vocal coach in Washington, D.C., insists that she receives both male and female clients with equal frequency—not because either gender is concerned that they sound too feminine, but that they sound too young.

Findings have thus been inconclusive regarding HRT as a gendered speech pattern, though the (partial) evidence that HRT is more common among women is consistent with the third principle of the gender paradox identified by sociolinguist William Labov, namely that &quot;in linguistic change from below, women use higher frequencies of innovative forms more than men do.&quot; Viewing HRT as &quot;change from below&quot; also explains why it appears to be more common among young speakers.

There appears to be merit to the claim that gendered connotations of HRT give rise to difficulties for women in particular. Anne Charity Hudley, a linguist at Stanford University, suggests, &quot;When certain linguistic traits are tied to women . . . they often will be assigned a negative attribute without any actual evidence.&quot; Negative associations with the speech pattern, in combination with gendered expectations, have contributed to an implication that for female speakers to be viewed as authoritative, they ought to sound more like men than women. These implications are perpetuated by various media, including the coverage of politics.

U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, for example, has voiced her concern that traditionally feminine speech patterns do not allow a female speaker to be taken seriously. &quot;To meet those standards,&quot; she says, &quot;you have to speak less like a young girl and more like a young, aspiring professional . . . it&#x27;s a choice every young woman is going to have to make about how she wants to be and how she wants to be received.&quot; Lydia Dallet of &quot;Business Insider&quot; affirms this concern.

== Origins ==
The origins of HRT remain uncertain. Anecdotal evidence places the conception of the American English variety on the West Coast—anywhere from Southern California to the Pacific Northwest. This in turn comes into prominence due to development of &quot;Valleyspeak&quot; popularized by the Frank Zappa song &quot;Valley Girl&quot; in the early 1980s.

With respect to the southern hemisphere, it has been suggested that the feature may have originated in New Zealand.

It is unclear whether the American English varieties and the Oceanic varieties had any influence on each other regarding the spread of HRT.

<doc id="627027" wikidata="Q7283641" url="?curid=627027" title="Rahway River">
<text>The Rahway River is a river in Essex, Middlesex, and Union Counties, New Jersey, United States, The Rahway, along with the Elizabeth River, Piles Creek, Passaic River, Morses Creek, and the Fresh Kills River (in Staten Island), has its river mouth at the Arthur Kill.

Part of the extended area of the New York-New Jersey Harbor Estuary, draining part of the suburban and urbanized area of New Jersey west of Staten Island, New York, the river is approximately long. The upper reaches are lined with several parks while the mouth serves as an industrial access channel on the Chemical Coast.

The river was once on the lands of the Lenape Native Americans, and tradition states that the name is after Rahwack, a local tribal chief.

The river is the source of drinking water for the City of Rahway. Each spring, the river is stocked with approximately 6,000 trout.

The river is also the source of the name of the Rahway Valley Railroad, which has a bridge over it at the Springfield-Union border.

==Route==
===Branches===
The Rahway River rises in Essex County as two separate branches. The West Branch begins at spring-fed Crystal Lake in West Orange and flows south through the South Mountain Reservation in the valley between first and second ridges of the Watchung Mountains. It runs directly through downtown Millburn. The East Branch rises as a surface stream in West Orange and forms part of the boundary between West Orange and Orange, then travels through the towns of South Orange and Maplewood.
The two branches meet at Hobart Gap near Interstate 78, continuing south through the Union County communities of Springfield, Union, Cranford and Clark. In Rahway the river receives the Robinson&#x27;s Branch and South Branch, which are approximately long. Before the creation of Union County, Robinson&#x27;s Branch was the area&#x27;s border between Essex and Middlesex Counties. The South Branch starts in Roosevelt Park in Edison behind the Menlo Park Mall, and flows through Edison, Iselin, and Rahway. The river&#x27;s mouth is at the Arthur Kill between Carteret (on the south) and Linden (on the north), opposite Port Mobil on Staten Island.

===Tributaries===
*Nomahegan Brook travels through Cranford, Kenilworth, Westfield, and Mountainside.
*Gallows Hill Brook rises in Fairview Cemetery in Westfield, travels through Garwood and Cranford, and joins the Rahway River at Hampton Park
*Orchard Brook travels through Garwood and enters Cranford by West Holly where it joins the Rahway. 
*Kings Creek, Cross Creek, and Marshes Creek joins the Rahway near its entry into the Arthur Kill

==Parks along the river==
===South Mountain Reservation===

South Mountain Reservation is home to Orange Reservoir and Campbell&#x27;s Pond. A dramatic feature is Hemlock Falls: a 25-foot-high cascade of Rahway water over rock cliffs. The reservoir located in the reservation&#x27;s northern tract. Within the borders of West Orange, it is owned by the City of Orange and operated and maintained under contract with United Water. It was originally developed during the intense urbanization of northeastern New Jersey in the late 19th century, drawing from the Rahway River. The man-made lake is no longer part of the water-supply system and since the late 2000s (decade) various proposals have been made to allow its use as a recreational resource as part of the Recreational Complex. The complex abutting the reservoir includes a miniature golf course, and a boathouse-restaurant, McLoone&#x27;s, opened in 2011.

Just below South Mountain Reservation in Millburn, New Jersey, the river runs through Taylor Park.

===Rahway River Parkway===
The Rahway River Parkway is a greenway of parkland that hugs the Rahway River and its tributaries. Formed by the Union County Parks Commission in the 1920s, was designed by the Olmsted Brothers firm, who were the sons of the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted.

The &quot;Friends of Rahway River Parkway,&quot; a nonprofit group, has been formed exclusively to encourage and advocate for the preservation, restoration and enhancement of the Rahway River Parkway, in accord with the Olmsted design principles inherent in its origins, and to promote appropriate public enjoyment of the Parkway.
**Springfield, New Jersey. Briant Park.
**Westfield/Mountainside. Echo Lake Park is situated on a lake formed on Nomahegan Brook, a tributary of the Rahway.
** The Cranford, New Jersey section of the Rahway River Parkway follows the banks of the meandering river as it flows south through Lenape Park, Nomahegan Park, Hampton Park, MacConnell Park, the Cranford Canoe Club, Hanson Park, Sperry Park, Josiah Crane Park, Droeschers Mill Park, and Mohawk Park. The land for Sperry Park was donated by William Miller Sperry.
**Clark/Winfield. Formerly Osceola Farm, owned by Thomas Sperry.
**Rahway, New Jersey. Rahway River Park abuts a graveyard along the river here. Milton Lake Park is popular for fishing.

===The Robinson&#x27;s Branch Reservoir===

The Robinson&#x27;s Branch Reservoir, also known as the Clark Reservoir, is the largest body of water in Union County, and sits on that tributary in Clark.

===Lower river===
*Hawk Rise Sanctuary in Linden, New Jersey. is a 95-acre ecological preserve and wetland complex. 
*Joseph Medwick Memorial Park in Carteret is named for baseball player Joe Medwick and offers scenic river vistas plus ball fields, tennis courts, playgrounds &amp; picnic groves.

The salt marshes and mudflats along the lower Rahway are high priority habitats and are the most extensive in the watershed and span four communities: Carteret, Linden, Woodbridge Township and Rahway. Encompassing over , this priority habitat contains 434 acres of salt marsh and 238 acres of brush and shrub lands. Over 1,500 gulls, many species of shorebirds, breeding clapper rail, egrets, ducks, plovers, hawks, pheasants, wintering northern harrier and marsh wrens utilize the site.

==The Rahway River Watershed Association and RiverFest==
The Rahway River Watershed Association is a non-profit organization dedicated to the protection and restoration of the river. RRWA works in cooperation with local river communities to provide opportunities for river education, curriculum support activities, community awareness of the river, and environmental stewardship of the watershed. The RRWA Watershed Learning Center (known as the Blue House) is located on the river at Lower Essex Street Park in Rahway.

The RRWA organizes an annual event in celebration of the river, RiverFest, featuring live music, art, food and other vendors, dance and environmental educational events.

==Recreation along the river==

===Canoeing and boating===

The Cranford Canoe Club, built in 1908, rents canoes and kayaks for trips on the Rahway River in Cranford.

The Rahway Yacht Club, founded in 1904, is a private boating club docked on the river in Rahway, New Jersey.

Echo Lake, off Nomahegan Brook (a Rahway tributary) in Westfield and Orange Reservoir in South Mountain in Maplewood offer paddle boating.

===Rahway River fishing===

Fishing is popular along the Rahway. Many local fishing enthusiasts are among the biggest local champions of keeping the Rahway River and its parkland clean and vibrant for wildlife.

Fishermen who enjoy Rahway River fishing are encouraged to take home all fishing line to avoid injuring osprey and other large wildlife via entanglement which has caused deaths along the river.

On the third Monday of each month the Rahway River Trout Unlimited Chapter holds its monthly general meeting at the Cranford Community Center at 7:30pm to discuss Rahway River fishing. Fly fishermen may be seen casting lines in the Rahway along the dams in Cranford.

Brown trout, brook trout and rainbow trout 9 to 11 inches long are stocked for Rahway River fishing from late March to mid-May (only rainbow has been stocked since 2015). Along with these good-sized trout, much bigger breeders are also stocked to excite those anglers skilled or lucky enough to catch one (5-pound trophies are caught by these fishermen each spring).

Large numbers of sunfish and catfish are present in the Rahway River.

Smallmouth bass and largemouth bass, some quite large, are found when fishing the Rahway, as are channel catfish and bullhead catfish.

Striped bass and eels also surge up the river from Raritan Bay and encountered during Rahway River fishing. Large and very powerful carp appear as well.

Mark Modoski, angler and contributor for &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot; magazine, has written about fishing for catfish and carp on Nomahegan Lake off the river.

The Rahway River is home to four anadromous fish species (fish that spawn in freshwater and live in saltwater) and one species of catadromous fish species (fish that spawn in salt water and live in freshwater).

There are long-discussed plans to install a fish ladder at the Rahway City Water Works to aid these fish during their spawning migrations. Fish ladders are inundated structures with small underwater steps that allow fish to navigate around a dam and continue their migration. Other approaches include removing obstructions that are inoperative or no longer serve their purpose, or improving water quality and reducing debris that obstructs passage.

The fish targeted for upstream passage at the Rahway River Water Supply Dam are alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), blueback herring (Alosa aestivalis), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), white perch (Morone Americana) and the endangered American eel (Anguilla rostrate). Alewife and blueback herring are collectively referred to as river herring due to their similarity in appearance, range, and life histories. River herring, gizzard shad, and white perch are all anadromous (adults spawn in freshwater; juveniles migrate to saltwater); whereas American eel are catadromous (adults spawn in the ocean; the young migrate to freshwater habitats).

Historically, anadromous spawning runs of alewife, blueback herring, striped bass, and American shad and catadromous runs of American eel were common in the NYC/NJ harbor estuary. However, poor stream conditions and an increased number of obstacles to upstream migration, like tide gates, culverts, and dams, have reduced these species’ 
migration opportunities. Restoring fish passage on major tributaries like the Rahway can be accomplished through the construction of fish ladders.

===Birding on the river===
Birdwatching is a frequent activity along the Rahway. The Friends of Lenape Park often birdwatch along the banks of its streams such as Nomahegan Brook.

===Other activities on the Rahway===

Cranford&#x27;s The Riverside Inn and the River and Rail Cantina sit aside the river with outdoor seating near parkland. McLoone&#x27;s Boathouse is located on Orange Reservoir in South Mountain Reservation. The famous Paper Mill Playhouse sits aside the river.

The Hanson Park Conservancy hosts an annual &quot;rubber ducky race&quot; in the river, over the Hansel Dam falls next to Sperry Park, as a fundraiser for the park.

The Great Pumpkin Sail is held in Echo Lake on All Saints&#x27; Day. At this annual event, on the day after Halloween, families bring their Halloween Jack-O-Lanterns, light them, and set them afloat on Echo Lake Park&#x27;s lower lake. The glowing firelit faces reflect in the water as families enjoy free hot chocolate, marshmallows, and entertainment around the campfire.

==Historic uses of the Rahway River==

Beginning in the 1880s, the Cranford River Improvement Association and other Cranford organizations held various water carnivals and regattas on the river. According to an 1886 New York Times article, the carnival&#x27;s decorations illuminated the night: &quot;nearly a hundred boats will be gaily decorated with sky lanterns, the river banks will be illuminated with colored lights, the bridges will be lit up, there will be bands of music and a display of fireworks.&quot; Novelist Robert Ferro described these carnivals in his 1983 novel &quot;The Family of Max Desir&quot;, centered on a fictionalized version of the river.

The Rahway was once host to a variety of sawmills and gristmills. Droeschers Mill is the last remaining mill on the Rahway.

The Paper Mill Playhouse is an acclaimed theater in the area for live theatrical performances. In March 1795, Sam Campbell built The Thistle Paper Mill on land along the Rahway River in the town of Millville, later renamed Millburn. Campbell ran his business for about 20 years until he was forced to close down due to a fire. The building remained vacant for several years and ownership changed several times. In the late 1870s, Diamond Mill Paper Company took over the property and used it for their paper making business until 1928.

The Rahway River was also the site of freshwater pearl-fishing as a form of recreation as depicted in photographs from the early 1910s.

==Art on the Rahway==

The American painter Hugh Bolton Jones (1848–1927) depicts the Rahway River in his 1880s work &quot;Spring,&quot; part of the collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Several landscape artists of the 19th century also painted the Rahway River&#x27;s woodland scenes en plein air, including Frank Townsend Lent and Bruce Crane, who painted in Cranford, and the aforementioned Hugh Bolton Jones.

==Flooding, environmental rehab and flood control==
The highly urbanized Rahway River watershed in New Jersey suffers from frequent flooding due to extensive development and destruction of riparian wetlands and floodplains.

Floods have caused damage to houses, businesses, municipal facilities and public infrastructure. Portions of the Rahway River Basin have also suffered environmental degradation and opportunities exist for restoration.

The most damaging floods of record within the Rahway River Basin resulted from the storms of July 1938, May 1968, August 1971, August 1973, July 1975, June 1992, October 1996, July 1997, Tropical Storm Floyd in September 1999, April 2007 Nor’easter, and Hurricane Irene in August 2011. During the April 2007 storm, 70 to 100 homes suffered major damage to first floor and foundations. Union County and the Township of Cranford were declared federal disaster areas as a result of the April 2007 storm. As a result of Hurricane Irene, residents and business owners along the Rahway River have suffered extensive financial losses and personal hardship than in most severe prior storms.

Organizations fighting for flood control and protection of the Rahway River watershed include:

*The Mayors Council on Rahway River Watershed Flood Control. After Hurricane Irene in 2011, mayors of towns along the Rahway River established this organization to find solutions to flooding in the Watershed.
* The Cranford Flood Advisory Committee (CFAC) was formed as an official committee of the Township and has been active on current issues since mid 1997.
* The Cranford Environmental Commission (&quot;My Green Cranford&quot;) is a statutory board of seven regular Cranford-resident members and two alternates Cranford resident-members.
* Rahway River Watershed Association. The purpose of the Rahway River Association is to protect and restore the Rahway River and its ecosystem.
*Rahway River Watershed Storm Water Advisory Board. With continued concerns about flooding, a regional board was formed in early 2013 to advise Rahway River Watershed towns and advocate for changes to ordinances and implementation of best storm water management practices that can protect water quality and reduce the quantity of uncontrolled runoff.
*1000 Rain Gardens. This initiative aims to develop, through public and private means, at least 1000 rain gardens in the Rahway River Watershed from West Orange in Essex County to Woodbridge in Middlesex County.
*The New Jersey Watershed Ambassadors Program is a community-oriented AmeriCorps environmental program coordinated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and is designed to raise awareness about watersheds in New Jersey. Through this program, AmeriCorps members are placed in watershed management areas across the state to serve the educational water-related interests of their local communities. The program invited all ages of citizens to improve the quality of New Jersey&#x27;s waterways and water quality.
Watershed Ambassadors monitor the rivers of New Jersey through volunteer monitoring programs. The AmeriCorps leaders are used to train community volunteers to use these two monitoring techniques in order to assess the health of waterways within their communities. Watershed Ambassadors make presentations to schools and community organizations along the Rahway River and other rivers for free. These interactive presentations explore water quality and watershed related topics in New Jersey.

In September 2016, the United States House of Representatives authorized the Rahway River Basin Flood Risk Management Feasibility Study under the Water Resources Development Act. The study is now a full-go after Congressman Leonard Lance and the Mayors Council on Rahway River Watershed Flood Control pushed for years for its completion.

Its goal is to devise a plan to protect New Jersey communities from Rahway River flooding.

“The Rahway River Basin Flood Risk Management Feasibility Study will create a lasting solution for the protection of New Jersey municipalities that include Cranford, Kenilworth, Maplewood, Millburn, Rahway, Springfield and Union and the surrounding areas from severe flooding,” said Lance. “For years these municipalities have pursued this project.&quot;

Local politicians, including Ann Dooley, have urged Senator Cory Booker to work on Rahway River flooding relief as well.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is partnering with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to carry out the Feasibility Study to identify various flood risk management alternatives for communities along the Rahway River Basin, with a specific emphasis on the city of Rahway and the township of Cranford.

The alternatives are currently undergoing economic analysis, comparing the amount of risk management provided to each alternative’s associated costs. In order for a flood risk management alternative to be considered by the Federal Government, it must provide a positive benefit-to-cost ratio. This economic analysis phase is important to not only determine the benefit-to-cost ratio of each alternative, but it is also critical for the justification and request for authorization from Congress to construct a project after the Feasibility Study is complete.

Descriptions of the flood risk management alternatives that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are analyzing are available.

Early in August 2016, Congressman Leonard Lance joined U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez (NJ) and Colonel David A. Caldwell, Commander of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (New York District), for a site visit of a proposed flooding solution, known as Alternative 4A.

That plan proposed modified the Orange Reservoir on the Rahway River in South Mountain Reservation through Cranford, as well as numerous properties in the City of Rahway.

== Rahway River cleanups==
Volunteers organize Rahway River clean-ups all year round. They remove discarded fishing lines, invasive weeds and discarded litter and compete to see who can remove the most debris. Depending on the weather, river cleaners are encouraged to dress warmly and wear boots. Gloves, litter grabbers and refreshments may occasionally be provided at these cleanups.

“The residents do a great job cleaning the parks,” Union County Watershed Ambassador Ismail Sukkar told LocalSource.


===Dirty soil dumping controversy===
Recently, environmental groups have expressed concern over two projects on the lower tidal banks of the Rahway, roughly at Potters Island:
* Soil Safe–Metro12, also known as the Rahway Arch, in Carteret. This project is alleged to involve the dumping of contaminated soil.
* 4050 Tremley Point Road This involves a concern by environmentalists raised in late 2016 over the dumping of contaminated soil on a wedge of riverside land where Marshes Creek meets the Rahway River (not to be confused with Morses Creek which flows into the Arthur Kill to the north). The 88-acre site on the river in a flood zone had lain untouched for almost 60 years; it had been used for coal ash disposal for a decade at that time, and environmental groups complained that the trucked-in soil was far more heavily contaminated than the site itself. The site had been purchased in 2013 to build a warehouse, trucking depot, driveway and parking lot.

==Legends of buried treasure==

According to recently resurfaced 19th century lore, pirate Captain William Kidd buried treasure on the banks of the Rahway River, alongside the body of one of his men he had just murdered. The location was said to on the southern banks of the river at a spot called Price&#x27;s or Post&#x27;s Woods, said to be midway between Rahway and the Arthur Kill. The murder and burial of treasure was witnessed secretly from a tree, allegedly, by a Lenape chieftain known as Ra-wa-rah who is the namesake of the city of Rahway, as Ra-wa-rah returned from a fishing journey.

<text>Georges Duboeuf (14 April 1933 – 4 January 2020) was a French wine merchant, and the founder of Les Vins Georges Duboeuf, one of the largest wine merchants in France. The company is known for its popularization and production of Beaujolais wines, leading to Duboeuf&#x27;s nicknames of &quot;le roi du Beaujolais&quot; or sometimes &quot;pape du Beaujolais&quot; (the king or pope of Beaujolais).

== Early life ==

Duboeuf was born on 14 April 1933 in Crêches-sur-Saône, near the village of Chaintré, in the Pouilly-Fuissé appellation of France. Pouilly-Fuissé consists of five villages, southwest of the commune of Mâcon, in the central French wine-making region of Burgundy. Duboeuf was raised on a small farm, where his family owned a few acres of Chardonnay vines. His father died when he was very young, and his uncle and older brother, Roger, took over the business.

==Career==
Duboeuf helped on the family vineyard growing up, cranking the manual grape crusher when he was just six. At the age of 18, he began delivering wine on his bicycle from producers to local restaurants. He began bottling Beaujolais to meet a customer&#x27;s commission, and went on to form a syndicate of 45 local growers, the Ecrin Mâconnais-Beaujolais. The organization fell apart due to squabbling, and Duboeuf became a négociant in 1964, when he founded Les Vins Georges Duboeuf.

=== Les Vins Georges Duboeuf ===
Duboeuf&#x27;s business produces more than 2.5 million cases of wine annually. He was almost single-handedly responsible for popularizing the annual Beaujolais nouveau phenomenon, and won awards for his wines. The company&#x27;s wine labels are easily recognizable by their use of colorful flower images and the distinctive Duboeuf insignia.

In 2018, Duboeuf passed control of the company to his son Franck Duboeuf.

==Personal life==
He married his wife Rolande in the early 1960s, and they had two children, Fabienne and Franck.

On 4 January 2020, Duboeuf died from a stroke at age 86.

<doc id="627036" wikidata="Q19853" url="?curid=627036" title="Redbourn">
<text>Redbourn is a village and civil parish in Hertfordshire, England. It is located from Harpenden, from St Albans and from Hemel Hempstead. The civil parish had a population of 6,913 according to the 2011 Census.

==History==
To the south-west of the village, just beyond the motorway, is the site of an Iron Age hill fort called the &quot;Aubreys&quot;. Nearby is Aubrey Park, which dates back to the 13th century. To the north of the village is the site of a complex of Roman temples.

The village has been continuously settled in since Saxon times at least and is recorded in the Domesday Book. Its parish church, St Mary&#x27;s, was built in the early 12th century. Some fifty years later, a small priory was founded half a mile away on Redbourn Common, after the abbot of St Albans Abbey decided to consecrate the ground. Some bones had been found on the spot, reputed to be of St Amphibalus, the priest who had converted St Alban to Christianity.

In the 16th century, the manor of Redbourn belonged to the Reade family. Sir Richard Reade, formerly Lord Chancellor of Ireland, bought the manor when he came back to England from Ireland; he died in 1575 and was buried at the parish church. Reade left legacies to Winchester College and for the upkeep of the parish of Redbourn. The manor of Redbourn itself was inherited by his eldest son, Innocent, who also inherited the older family estate at Nether Wallop.

In 2010, Redbourn&#x27;s St Mary&#x27;s Church celebrated its 900th anniversary.

==Governance==
The three tiers of local government are Redbourn Parish Council, St Albans City &amp; District Council and Hertfordshire County Council.

==Economy==
For a long time, Redbourn was the centre of a farming community; it had a successful watercress business on the water meadows of the River Ver. Just south of the village, flour was ground at Redbournbury Mill, a recently restored watermill.

Silk throwing was carried out at the steam-driven Woollam&#x27;s Mill, near Redbourn Common. The mill was taken over by John Mangrove &amp; Son, but closed in 1938. At the outbreak of the Second World War, Brooke Bond took over the silk mill as a food factory. Whilst it was still open, a young man in the village fell into a vat of jam and died. After a successful lobbying campaign by schoolchildren in 2003, a memorial bench was unveiled to &quot;Sticky Joe&quot;, as he had come to be known. After the closure of the factory in 1996, the old silk mill manager&#x27;s house, the grade II-listed &quot;Silk Mill House&quot; was given to Redbourn Parish Council; it became the Redbourn Village Museum, opening in May 2000. The former silk mill site is now a housing estate.

Local grocer Russell Harborough also set up a jam-making factory; in 1956, it was bought by Thomas Mercer Ltd, a marine chronometer manufacturer. The site, just off High Street, is now an industrial estate.

Old industries in the village included making straw plait and hat making. Redbourn Village Hall, in the centre of the village&#x27;s High Street, was formerly a straw hat factory, which has been extensively renovated, thanks mainly to money from the National Lottery and Redbourn Parish Council.

In 1903, Mr Boucher, the local dentist, owned the first private car in the village, a 6 hp Gladiator. Several motor rallies were held in Redbourn in the 1900s using &quot;The Bull&quot; pub as a base. Three garages, in High Street, Dunstable Road and at Church End, have closed, leaving only a filling station next to &quot;The Chequers&quot; pub in the St Albans Road.

==Transport==
The nearest National Rail stations are at:
* , on the West Coast Main Line. London Northwestern Railway operates services between and .
* , on the Midland Main Line. Govia Thameslink Railway operates services between , and .

Bus services are operated by Centrebus (South), Red Rose Travel and Red Eagle. Routes connect the village with Borehamwood, Dunstable, Hemel Hempstead, Harpenden, Luton and St Albans.

===History===
Owing to its proximity to London, Redbourn became an important coaching station in the 17th and 18th centuries; it was known as the &quot;Street of Inns&quot;, with at least 25 pubs and inns at its peak. However, the expansion of the railways in the 1840s sounded the death knell of stagecoaches.

A branch railway line, known as the Nickey Line, connected with ; it passed through . It opened on 16 July 1877 and was closed in 1979. The route is now a shared-use path.

The first idea for a Redbourn by-pass came in 1935 and one was eventually completed in 1984. A by-pass committee was established in May 1978 and objections were examined at a public enquiry held in February 1982.

==Sport==
Redbourn Cricket Club was formed in about 1823, but records show that organised cricket was played on Redbourn Common some eighty years earlier. Some Hertfordshire County histories record cricket being played there in 1666, which would make the village one of the oldest cricketing locations on record in England.

Redbourn Golf Club is well known for its two golf courses and driving range. The Kinsbourne Course is considered one of the best short courses in Hertfordshire.

==County show==
The Hertfordshire County Show takes place annually in late May at a 70-acre showground site, one mile north of the village.

==Awards==
Redbourn has won the following awards:
* Hertfordshire Village of the Year: 2002 (Overall and Western Area Winner) and a section winner in 2003
* Eastern and Home Counties Section winner, 2002 
* Hertfordshire &quot;Village of the Year&quot;, western area, 2004

<text>Lyudmila Alekseyevna Pakhomova (; 31 December 1946 – 17 May 1986) was a Russian ice dancer who competed for the Soviet Union. With her husband Aleksandr Gorshkov, she was the 1976 Olympic champion, one of the oldest female figure skating Olympic champions.

They are six-time World Champions (1970–74, 1976), as well as six-time European champions (1970–71, 1973–76), which makes them the most decorated of all-time at both events in the pair discipline.

== Life and career ==
Pakhomova was the daughter of Alexei Pakhomov, an aviation general. She began figure skating at age seven, when her grandmother brought her to Children and Youth Sports School by the Young Pioneers Stadium in Moscow. Her first ice dancing partner was the nine-years-older Viktor Ryzhkin, formerly her coach, with whom she trained at CSKA Moscow under Stanislav Zhuk. They won three Soviet national titles and placed 10th at the 1966 World Championships. They were the first Soviet ice dancers to compete at Worlds.

After her partnership with Ryzhkin ended, Pakhomova invited Aleksandr Gorshkov to skate with her. He was only a couple of months older and also trained at CSKA Moscow. Since he had much less experience, some experts were skeptical of her choice. Despite the initial experience gap, Gorshkov said that Pakhomova was a strong personality who was determined they would become champions.

Pakhomova/Gorshkov began training in May 1966, under coach Elena Tchaikovskaia, and made their international debut in December of the same year. They competed for Dynamo. After teaming up, a personal relationship developed between the duo and Gorshkov proposed marriage; Pakhomova responded that they would marry only if they became World champions.

Pakhomova/Gorshkov performed in the ice dancing demonstration event at the 1968 Winter Olympics – the event determined if ice dancing would be added as an official Olympic sport and was successful. They won their first World title in 1970 and married later that year. The duo repeated as World champions in 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1974. In 1974, Pakhomova/Gorshkov and Tchaikovskaya created the Tango Romantica, which the ISU would later adopt as a compulsory dance.

Following the 1975 European Championships, Gorshkov began feeling ill and underwent a lung operation, with their coach Elena Tchaikovskaia donating blood. They flew to Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S. for the 1975 World Championships, unsure about their participation. During the first practice session, Gorshkov had trouble breathing and needed to be given oxygen – they withdrew from the event. In the Soviet Union, rumors circulated that Gorshkov had died on the flight to the United States and the chairman of the Soviet Sports Committee called him to check if he was still alive.

Pakhomova/Gorshkov returned to competition the following season. Ice dancing debuted as an official Olympic sport at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck, Austria, and Pakhomova/Gorshkov became the first Olympic champions in the discipline. They won their sixth World title in 1976 in Gothenburg, Sweden. They retired from competition later that year. In 1977, they had a daughter, Yulia Gorshkova.

Pakhomova began coaching at CSKA. Her students included 1980 and 1981 World Junior champions Elena Batanova / Alexei Soloviev and European medalists Natalia Annenko / Genrikh Sretenski. She coached Igor Shpilband for eight years (age 12 to 20). He and partner Tatiana Gladkova became the 1983 World Junior champions.

In late 1979, Pakhomova began having health problems which were eventually diagnosed as leukemia, but she continued to go out onto the ice even after her cancer made it very difficult. Her husband said she did not want to change anything in her life and it was not in her nature to give up. Pakhomova died at the age of 39 on 17 May 1986 and was interred in the Vagankovo Cemetery in Moscow.

A minor planet, 3231 Mila, discovered by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Zhuravleva in 1972, is named after her. Pakhomova was posthumously inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 1988, along with Gorshkov.

<doc id="627039" wikidata="Q573928" url="?curid=627039" title="Szmul Zygielbojm">
<text>Szmul Mordko Zygielbojm (; ; – ) was a Polish socialist politician, Bund trade-union activist, and member of the National Council of the Polish government-in-exile.

Zygielbojm was born in 1895 into a working-class family and had to leave school at age ten. In his early twenties he became involved in Bund trade-union activism, and in 1924 was elected to the Bund Central Committee. He edited a Bund newspaper and in 1938 was elected to the Łódź city council. Upon Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland, he fled to Warsaw and was briefly a member of the &quot;Judenrat&quot;.

He fled to the Netherlands, then to England, where he was appointed to the National Council of the Polish government-in-exile. He interviewed Jan Karski and tried to publicize the mass murder of Jews in German-occupied Poland. After the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was brutally crushed, and Warsaw&#x27;s remaining Jews murdered by units under SS-Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, Zygielbojm committed suicide to protest the inaction of the western Allies.

==Early years==
Szmul Zygielbojm was born on February 21, 1895, in the village of Borowica, Poland (then part of the Russian Empire). His family moved to Krasnystaw in 1899. Due to poverty, he left school and began working in a factory at the age of 10. Zygielbojm left home for Warsaw when he was 12, but he returned to Krasnystaw at the beginning of World War I and moved with his family to Chełm.

==Bundist career==
In his 20s, Zygielbojm became involved in the Jewish labor movement, and in 1917 he represented Chełm at the first Bundist convention in Poland. Zygielbojm so impressed the Bund leadership at the convention that he was invited to Warsaw in 1920 to serve as secretary of the Trade Union of Jewish Metal Workers and a member of the Warsaw Committee of the Bund. In 1924 he was elected to the Bund&#x27;s Central Committee, a position he held until his death.

By 1930, Zygielbojm was editing the Jewish labor unions&#x27; journal, &quot;Arbeiter Fragen&quot; (&quot;Worker’s Issues&quot;). In 1936, the Central Committee sent him to Łódź to lead the Jewish workers&#x27; movement, and in 1938 he was elected to its city council.

==Exile==
After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Zygielbojm returned to Warsaw, where he participated in the defense committee during the siege and defense of the city. When the Nazis occupied Warsaw, they demanded 12 hostages from the population to prevent further resistance. Stefan Starzyński, the city&#x27;s president, proposed that the Jewish labor movement provide a hostage, Ester Iwińska. Zygielbojm volunteered in her place.

On his release, Zygielbojm was made a member of the Jewish Council, or Judenrat, which the Nazis had appointed. The Nazis ordered the Judenrat to begin the creation of a ghetto within Warsaw. Because of Zygielbojm&#x27;s public opposition to the order, his fellow Bundists feared for his safety and arranged for him to leave. In December 1939, Zygielbojm reached Belgium. Early in 1940, he spoke before a meeting of the Labour and Socialist International in Brussels and described the early stages of the Nazi persecution of Polish Jewry.

When the Nazis invaded Belgium in May 1940, Zygielbojm went to France and then the US, where he spent a year and a half trying to convince Americans of the dire situation facing Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland.

===National Council ===
In March 1942, he arrived in London to join the National Council of the Polish government in exile, where he was one of two Jewish members (the other was Ignacy Schwarzbart). In London, Zygielbojm continued to speak publicly about the fate of Polish Jews, including a meeting of the British Labour Party and a speech broadcast on BBC Radio on June 2, 1942. On June 25, 1942, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; reported the existence of Nazi gas chambers and the mass killing of Jews, based on Szmul Zygielbojm&#x27;s information.

His booklet, written in English in 1942 and titled &quot;Stop Them Now. German Mass Murder of Jews in Poland&quot;, with a foreword by Lord Wedgwood, was his final attempt to make the world aware of the extermination of Jews in Europe.

In the middle of 1942, Jan Karski, who had been serving as a courier between the Polish underground and the Polish government in exile, was smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto. One of his guides in the ghetto was Leon Feiner who, like Zygielbojm, was a Bundist. Karski asked Feiner what prominent American and British Jews should do. &quot;Tell the Jewish leaders,&quot; Feiner said, &quot;that ... they must find the strength and courage to make sacrifices no other statesmen have ever had to make, sacrifices as painful as the fate of my dying people, and as unique.&quot;

In the months following his return from Warsaw, Karski reported to the Polish, British and American governments on the situation in Poland, especially the Warsaw Ghetto and the Bełżec death camp, which he had visited secretly. (It is now believed that Karski had seen the Izbica Lubelska transit ghetto where Jews were held until they could be sent to Bełżec.) Newspaper accounts based on Karski&#x27;s reports were published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; on November 25 and November 26, and &quot;The Times&quot; of London on December 7.

In December, Karski described the conditions in the ghetto to Zygielbojm, who passed along Feiner&#x27;s message:

Two weeks later, Zygielbojm spoke again on BBC Radio concerning the fate of the Jews of Poland. &quot;It will actually be a shame to go on living,&quot; he said, &quot;if steps are not taken to halt the greatest crime in human history.&quot;

==Suicide==

On 19 April 1943, high-ranking officials of the Allied governments of the UK and the US met in Bermuda, ostensibly to discuss the situation of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. By coincidence, that same day the Nazis attempted to liquidate the remaining Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto and met with unexpected resistance.

By the beginning of May, the futility of the Bermuda Conference had become apparent. Days later, Zygielbojm received word of the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and of the ghetto&#x27;s final liquidation. He learned that his wife Manya and 16-year-old son Tuvia had been killed there. At his home in west London, 12, Porchester Square, Paddington, on 11 May Zygielbojm committed suicide with an overdose of sodium amytal, as a protest against the indifference and inaction of the Allied governments in the face of the Holocaust. He died at St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington, on 12 May 1943.

In a long suicide note addressed to Polish president Władysław Raczkiewicz and prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Zygielbojm said that while the Nazis were responsible for the murder of the Polish Jews, &quot;the whole of humanity&quot; was also indirectly culpable. He accused the Western Allies of &quot;looking on passively upon this murder of defenseless millions of tortured children, women and men,&quot; and the Polish government of not doing enough.

He wished his letter to be widely publicized and hoped that &quot;the Polish Government [would] embark immediately on diplomatic action... in order to save the living remnant of the Polish Jews from destruction.&quot;

After his death, Zygielbojm&#x27;s seat in the Polish exile parliament was taken over by Emanuel Scherer. Zygielbojm&#x27;s younger son, Joseph, survived the ghetto&#x27;s destruction. After taking a leadership role in the Polish resistance during the war, he emigrated to the United States. He became a scientist at NASA. He died in 1995, survived by his sons, Arthur and Paul.

Zygielbojm did not leave a will, but administration of his estate, valued at £ (), was granted to Lucjan Blit, a journalist.

==Memorials==

Zygielbojm&#x27;s body was cremated in symbolic protest and unity with the murdered millions of the Holocaust. In 1959, his surviving son located the cremains in a shed in the Golders Green Jewish Cemetery in London. Because Zygielbojm had been cremated, the religious community would not permit his ashes to be buried in a Jewish cemetery. With the assistance of the American Jewish labor movement, Zygielbojm&#x27;s cremains were brought to the US and interred at the New Mt. Carmel Cemetery in Ridgewood, New York, in 1961.

In May 1996, a plaque in memory of Zygielbojm was dedicated at the corner of Porchester Road and Porchester Square in London, near where he had committed suicide. The creation of the memorial was a joint project of the Bund and the Jewish Socialists&#x27; Group. The Polish ambassador and the mayor of Westminster were present.

A granite memorial to Zygielbojm was incorporated into a building at 5 S. Dubois Street in Muranów, a housing project built after World War II on the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto.

In 2008 a plaque was added to the building in Chełm where Zygielbojm had lived. A Bundist commander of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Marek Edelman, wrote a letter that was read at the plaque&#x27;s dedication.

Zygielbojm is the subject of a 2001 Polish documentary, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Death of Zygielbojm&quot;). The film, directed by , won a special mention at the Kraków Film Festival.

In 2021, he was the subject of a Polish drama film (&quot;The Death of Zygielbojm&quot;), which tells the story of an investigation by a British journalist into the life of Szmul Zygielbojm and his attempts to expose Nazi Germany&#x27;s war crimes. It was directed by Ryszard Brylski and stars Wojciech Mecwaldowski in the title role.

<text>An electronic signature, or e-signature, is data that is logically associated with other data and which is used by the signatory to sign the associated data. This type of signature has the same legal standing as a handwritten signature as long as it adheres to the requirements of the specific regulation under which it was created (e.g., eIDAS in the European Union, NIST-DSS in the USA or ZertES in Switzerland).

Electronic signatures are a legal concept distinct from digital signatures, a cryptographic mechanism often used to implement electronic signatures. While an electronic signature can be as simple as a name entered in an electronic document, digital signatures are increasingly used in e-commerce and in regulatory filings to implement electronic signatures in a cryptographically protected way. Standardization agencies like NIST or ETSI provide standards for their implementation (e.g., NIST-DSS, XAdES or PAdES). The concept itself is not new, with common law jurisdictions having recognized telegraph signatures as far back as the mid-19th century and faxed signatures since the 1980s.

==Description==
The USA&#x27;s E-Sign Act, signed June 30, 2000 by President Clinton was described months later as &quot;more like a seal than a signature.&quot;

An electronic signature is intended to provide a secure and accurate identification method for the signatory during a transaction.
Definitions of electronic signatures vary depending on the applicable jurisdiction. A common denominator in most countries is the level of an advanced electronic signature requiring that:
# The signatory can be uniquely identified and linked to the signature
# The signatory must have sole control of the private key that was used to create the electronic signature
# The signature must be capable of identifying if its accompanying data has been tampered with after the message was signed
# In the event that the accompanying data has been changed, the signature must be invalidated

Electronic signatures may be created with increasing levels of security, with each having its own set of requirements and means of creation on various levels that prove the validity of the signature. To provide an even stronger probative value than the above described advanced electronic signature, some countries like member states of the European Union or Switzerland introduced the qualified electronic signature. It is difficult to challenge the authorship of a statement signed with a qualified electronic signature - the statement is non-repudiable. Technically, a qualified electronic signature is implemented through an advanced electronic signature that utilizes a digital certificate, which has been encrypted through a security signature-creating device and which has been authenticated by a qualified trust service provider.

==In contract law==
Since well before the American Civil War began in 1861, morse code was used to send messages electrically via the telegraph. Some of these messages were agreements to terms that were intended as enforceable contracts. An early acceptance of the enforceability of telegraphic messages as electronic signatures came from a New Hampshire Supreme Court case, Howley v. Whipple, in 1869.

In the 1980s, many companies and even some individuals began using fax machines for high-priority or time-sensitive delivery of documents. Although the original signature on the original document was on paper, the image of the signature and its transmission was electronic.

Courts in various jurisdictions have decided that enforceable legality of electronic signatures can include agreements made by email, entering a personal identification number (PIN) into a bank ATM, signing a credit or debit slip with a digital pen pad device (an application of graphics tablet technology) at a point of sale, installing software with a clickwrap software license agreement on the package, and signing electronic documents online.

The first agreement signed electronically by two sovereign nations was a Joint Communiqué recognizing the growing importance of the promotion of electronic commerce, signed by the United States and Ireland in 1998.

=== Enforceability ===
In 1996 the United Nations published the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce. Article 7 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce was highly influential in the development of electronic signature laws around the world, including in the US. In 2001, UNCITRAL concluded work on a dedicated text, the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures, which has been adopted in some 30 jurisdictions. Article 9, paragraph 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, 2005, which establishes a mechanism for functional equivalence between electronic and handwritten signatures at the international level as well as for the cross-border recognition. The latest UNCITRAL text dealing with electronic signatures is article 16 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on the Use and Cross-border Recognition of Identity Management and Trust Services (2022).

Canadian law (PIPEDA) attempts to clarify the situation by first defining a generic electronic signature as &quot;a signature that consists of one or more letters, characters, numbers or other symbols in digital form incorporated in, attached to or associated with an electronic document,&quot; then defining a secure electronic signature as an electronic signature with specific properties. PIPEDA&#x27;s secure electronic signature regulations refine the definition as being a digital signature applied and verified in a specific manner.

In the European Union, EU Regulation No 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European internal market (eIDAS) sets the legal frame for electronic signatures. It repeals Directive 1999/93/EC. The current and applicable version of eIDAS was published by the European Parliament and the European Council on July 23, 2014. Following Article 25 (1) of the eIDAS regulation, an advanced electronic signature shall “not be denied legal effect and admissibility as evidence in legal proceedings&quot;. However it will reach a higher probative value when enhanced to the level of a qualified electronic signature. By requiring the use of a qualified electronic signature creation device and being based on a certificate that has been issued by a qualified trust service provider, the upgraded advanced signature then carries according to Article 25 (2) of the eIDAS Regulation the same legal value as a handwritten signature. However, this is only regulated in the European Union and similarly through ZertES in Switzerland. A qualified electronic signature is not defined in the United States.

The U.S. Code defines an electronic signature for the purpose of US law as &quot;an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.&quot; It may be an electronic transmission of the document which contains the signature, as in the case of facsimile transmissions, or it may be encoded message, such as telegraphy using Morse code.

In the United States, the definition of what qualifies as an electronic signature is wide and is set out in the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (&quot;UETA&quot;) released by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1999. It was influenced by ABA committee white papers and the uniform law promulgated by NCCUSL. Under UETA, the term means &quot;an electronic sound, symbol, or process, attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record.&quot; This definition and many other core concepts of UETA are echoed in the U.S. ESign Act of 2000. 48 US states, the District of Columbia, and the US Virgin Islands have enacted UETA. Only New York and Illinois have not enacted UETA, but each of those states has adopted its own electronic signatures statute. As of June 11, 2020, Washington State Office of CIO adopted UETA.

In Australia, an electronic signature is recognised as &quot;not necessarily the writing in of a name, but maybe any mark which identifies it as the act of the party.” Under the Electronic Transactions Acts in each Federal, State and Territory jurisdiction, an electronic signature may be considered enforceable if (a) there was a method used to identify the person and to indicate that person’s intention in respect of the information communicated and the method was either: (i) as reliable as appropriate for the purpose for which the electronic communication was generated or communicated, in light of all the circumstances, including the relevant agreement; or (ii) proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions above by itself or together with further evidence and the person to whom the signature is required to be given consents to that method.

===Usage===
In 2016, Aberdeen Strategy and Research reported that 73% of &quot;best-in-class&quot; and 34% of all other respondents surveyed made use of electronic signature processes in supply chain and procurement, delivering benefits in the speed and efficiency of key procurement activities. The percentages of their survey respondents using electronic signatures in accounts payable and accounts receivable processes were a little lower, 53% of &quot;best-in-class&quot; respondents in each case.

==Technological implementations (underlying technology)==
=== Digital signature ===
Digital signatures are cryptographic implementations of electronic signatures used as a proof of authenticity, data integrity and non-repudiation of communications conducted over the Internet. When implemented in compliance to digital signature standards, digital signing should offer end-to-end privacy with the signing process being user-friendly and secure. Digital signatures are generated and verified through standardized frameworks such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) by NIST or in compliance to the XAdES, PAdES or CAdES standards, specified by the ETSI.

There are typically three algorithms involved with the digital signature process:
* Key generation – This algorithm provides a private key along with its corresponding public key.
* Signing – This algorithm produces a signature upon receiving a private key and the message that is being signed.
* Verification – This algorithm checks for the message&#x27;s authenticity by verifying it along with the signature and public key.

The process of digital signing requires that its accompanying public key can then authenticate the signature generated by both the fixed message and private key. Using these cryptographic algorithms, the user&#x27;s signature cannot be replicated without having access to their private key. A secure channel is not typically required. By applying asymmetric cryptography methods, the digital signature process prevents several common attacks where the attacker attempts to gain access through the following attack methods.

The most relevant standards on digital signatures with respect to size of domestic markets are the Digital Signature Standard (DSS) by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the eIDAS Regulation enacted by the European Parliament. OpenPGP is a non-proprietary protocol for email encryption through public key cryptography. It is supported by PGP and GnuPG, and some of the S/MIME IETF standards and has evolved into the most popular email encryption standard in the world.

===Biometric signature===

An electronic signature may also refer to electronic forms of processing or verifying identity through the use of biometric &quot;signatures&quot; or biologically identifying qualities of an individual. Such signatures use the approach of attaching some biometric measurement to a document as evidence. Biometric signatures include fingerprints, hand geometry (finger lengths and palm size), iris patterns, voice characteristics, retinal patterns, or any other human body property. All of these are collected using electronic sensors of some kind.

Biometric measurements of this type are useless as passwords because they can&#x27;t be changed if compromised. However, they might be serviceable, except that to date, they have been so easily deceived that they can carry little assurance that the person who purportedly signed a document was actually the person who did. For example, a replay of the electronic signal produced and submitted to the computer system responsible for &#x27;affixing&#x27; a signature to a document can be collected via wiretapping techniques. Many commercially available fingerprint sensors have low resolution and can be deceived with inexpensive household items (for example, gummy bear candy gel). In the case of a user&#x27;s face image, researchers in Vietnam successfully demonstrated in late 2017 how a specially crafted mask could beat Apple&#x27;s Face ID on iPhone X.

<text>François Gonnessiat (May 22, 1856 (Nurieux-Volognat)–October 18, 1934) was a French astronomer, observer of comets and discoverer of two minor planets.

He worked at the Observatory of Lyon. In 1889 he won the Lalande Prize for astronomy from the French Academy of Sciences; 1901 became director of the Quito (Ecuador) Observatory for the purpose of making geodetic measurements. He became a well known and respected member of the academic scene of the city, where a street is named after him. From 1908 to 1931, he was director of the Algiers Observatory where one of his colleagues was Benjamin Jekhovsky. He was also director of the Quito Astronomical Observatory.

The asteroid 1177 Gonnessia was named in his memory ().

== Obituary ==
* The obituary notice incorrectly states that he was director of the Algiers Observatory only until 1916, rather than 1931.

<text>Mary Norris (&quot;née&quot; Cronin, 1932 – 31 May 2017) was a young woman in Ireland who was sent to a Magdalene asylum, where her name was changed and she was imprisoned until removed by an aunt. Norris spent two years performing hard labor in the Good Shepherd Convent, a Magdalene asylum. Norris later came forward and recounted her experiences of abuse in the asylum and also the St Joseph&#x27;s Orphanage in Killarney.

==Biography==
Norris was the eldest of eight children, was born in 1932 in Sneem, South Kerry, Ireland. She was sent to a Magdalene laundry or asylum run by the Good Shepherd Order in Cork, Ireland, in 1949 at the age of 16. She spent two years there. The laundry closed down in 1994.

Norris was removed from her mother at the age of twelve. Norris&#x27;s father died when she was twelve and her mother then pursued a relationship with a local farmer, which caught the attention of the parish priest. The priest wanted Norris&#x27;s mother to marry the farmer or end the relationship, &quot;and when neither happened with the alacrity he expected, the children were seized and made wards of the courts.&quot; The children were taken to a judge and made wards of court. They were sent to different places run by different Roman Catholic institutions. Norris found herself at St Joseph&#x27;s Orphanage in Killarney.

At the age of sixteen, Norris was sent to work as a maid, but was returned to the orphanage after she went to a cinema without permission. She was then sent to a laundry in Cork. She reports that the way she was treated at the laundry amounted to slavery, and that the girls and women were forced to work ten hours a day every day except Sunday. She reports also that her name was changed to Myra, as the nuns felt she did not deserve to share her name with the Virgin Mary, and that she was told falsely that her family had abandoned her. She was given the number 30 as an identifier.

When Mary had been in the Magdalene laundry for two years, a concerned aunt in America tracked her down, and removed her from the laundry. (Later Mary petitioned the sisters of the Good Shepherd in Cork to obtain a list of the names of the Magdalenes who had been buried in unmarked graves behind the laundry.) She was reunited with her mother, brothers, and sisters. Eventually she moved to London with her mother. After her mother&#x27;s death in 1989, Mary returned to Ireland.

Her brothers had been with the Christian Brothers in Tralee—an order that has also, in some cases, been found guilty of abuse. Her brothers were both alcoholics at the time of their deaths. One died as a result of a fire; the other as a result of murder. Her sisters emigrated, and Norris is the sole member of her immediate family to remain in Ireland.

She discussed her experience as an &quot;orphan&quot; in an interview published by the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; in January 1999. Mary was married twice and had one daughter, also named Mary Patricia Cronin at birth. She was born in London and placed for adoption at infant stage of 6 weeks. However, Mary and her daughter, later known as Susan Ann Davis reunited in 1984 when Susan was living in Scotland. Susan died on 15 July 2016.

Mary Norris died in Knocknagoshel, County Kerry on 31 May 2017.

<doc id="627057" wikidata="Q262511" url="?curid=627057" title="Plaza Sésamo">
<text>Plaza Sésamo () is the first international co-production of the educational children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Its first season premiered in Mexico in 1972, and the last season ended in 2018 during the holiday season and the 50th anniversary of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, but the show returned in 2020. It has also aired throughout Latin America, to a potential audience of 25 million children in 34 countries. Unlike some of the earliest co-productions, which consisted of dubbed versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; sketches with local language voice-overs, &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; along with Vila Sésamo were actual co-productions. Half of the show was adapted from the American show, and half was original material, created in Mexico by Mexican writers, performers, and producers. The first season consisted of 130 half-hour episodes. The &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; development process was similar to that of the American show. Its goals were developed by local experts in television, child development, and early education during curriculum seminars in Caracas, Venezuela. &quot;Sésamo&quot;″s goals emphasized problem solving and reasoning, and also included perception, symbolic representation, human diversity, and the child&#x27;s environment. Other goals included community cooperation, family life, nutrition, health, safety, self-esteem, and expressing emotions. Early reading skills were taught through the whole language method. The show&#x27;s budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US$1.6 million.

The show&#x27;s set consisted of a typical neighborhood square (or plaza) found throughout the region. New Muppets and human characters were created. In all, four seasons of &quot;Sésamo&quot; were filmed. The first season resulted in some of the highest ratings in Mexico. The fourth season, filmed in 1995, was broadcast in the U.S., making it the first foreign-language co-production shown in the U.S. Studies conducted after the first season of &quot;Sésamo&quot; showed that it had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience. Highly significant difference were found in tests about general knowledge, letters, and numbers after children were exposed to the show. Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers, even in subjects that were not taught by the show. Characters from the show participated in campaigns promoting health and nutrition; in 2009, Sesame Workshop, the organization responsible for the show, was awarded the &quot;Champion of Health&quot; award by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for its efforts.

&quot;Sesame Amigos&quot;, a Sesame Workshop production for Spanish-speakers from the United States, debuted in 2015. This series aired Saturday mornings on Univision as part of their &quot;Planeta U&quot; block until October 2017 when it was replaced by &quot;Calimero&quot;.

== Background ==
A few months after the 1969 debut of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; on PBS in the US, producers from several countries all around the world approached the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop, or &quot;the Workshop&quot;), the organization responsible for the show&#x27;s production, to create and produce versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in their countries. Co-creator Joan Ganz Cooney was approached by German public television officials about a year after the US version debuted. Many years later, Cooney recalled, &quot;To be frank, I was really surprised, because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show. We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American, and it turns out they&#x27;re the most international characters ever created&quot;. She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann, who left commercial television to become her assistant, as a CTW vice-president. One of Dann&#x27;s tasks was to field offers to produce versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in other countries. By summer 1970, he had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call &quot;co-productions&quot;.

As of 2006, there were 20 active co-productions. In 2000, CTW vice-president Charlotte Cole estimated that there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140 countries. Doreen Carvajal of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that income from the co-productions accounted for US$96 million in 1994. Cole stated, &quot;Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world&quot;. Most of the early international versions were what Cole called &quot;fairly simple&quot;, consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways. Studies conducted on the effects of several co-productions found that viewers of these shows gain basic skills from watching them.

==Production==
&quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; debuted in Mexico on the Televisa network in 1972. According to &quot;Sesame Street&quot; producer Gregory J. Gettas, &quot;Plazo Sésamo&quot; was one of Sesame Street&#x27;s first true co-productions, programs that were developed using a variant of a flexible model, called the CTW model, created by the producers and creators of the American show, in the countries they aired. Like the American show in the late 1960s, the producers and researchers in Mexico conducted a curriculum seminar in Caracas, Venezuela. The goals they developed, however, were significantly different from the goals developed in the U.S. For example, the &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; team emphasized problem solving and reasoning. Their educational goals included perception, symbolic representation, human diversity, and the child&#x27;s environment. Other goals included community cooperation, family life, nutrition, health, safety, self-esteem, and expressing emotions. The show was designed to address the educational needs of the region&#x27;s 25 million children in 34 countries, including its target audience of 7 million children between the ages of 3 and 6 in Mexico alone. Despite their common language, the show&#x27;s Latin American viewers had a wide variety of customs and lifestyles. The show&#x27;s budget for the first and second seasons was approximately US$1.6 million.

The American-produced and dubbed segments were analyzed for cultural appropriateness. If any segments were considered &quot;too American&quot;, meaning that they contained English writing on the screen, showed the American flag, or overtly referred to American history, they were removed. The board was responsible for choosing content from the CTW&#x27;s inventory, and it had to satisfy the curriculum goals chosen by the Latin American researchers. They chose to teach reading through the whole language method, which emphasizes teaching children to recognize entire words or phrases, as opposed to phonetics, the way the American show taught reading. The Mexican producers and writers designed a distinctive set that appeared different than the American set and consisted of a typical neighborhood square (or plaza) found throughout the region. The set included a background of mountains, a vacant lot with playground equipment, houses, a combination repair shop and store-cafe, and the plaza&#x27;s central fountain and benches. New music, written and performed by Latin American artists, was recorded, and writers and actors from different Latin American countries like Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela, were hired.

New Muppet characters were created and performed by puppeteers trained in Mexico City. Abelardo, a giant parrot, was modeled after the American show&#x27;s Big Bird, and like Big Bird, was a full-body puppet that was controlled by the puppeteer from inside the costume. Paco, a grouchy green parrot, was based on Oscar the Grouch. Abelardo and Paco were both played by Justo Martinez. The Muppets Beto and Enrique, who were based upon Bert and Ernie of the American show, were called &quot;national favorites&quot; by the UPI less than three years after the show&#x27;s premiere. In 1975, Enrique and Beto were used to promote Mexico&#x27;s nationwide free vaccination campaign.

130 half-hour episodes of the show&#x27;s first season were shot in Mexico City entirely in Spanish, under the control of a Mexican research and production team. About half the show&#x27;s material was adapted from the American show and dubbed into Spanish, while the other half was produced in Mexico and included animation, live-action films, and studio sequences with human actors and Muppets. A Mexican board of advisers, who set curriculum goals for the show, approved all content, both Mexican and American, something that followed the newly established policies of the CTW. Mexican psychologist Rogelio Diaz-Guerrero was the first chair of the show&#x27;s advisory board, which was later expanded to include child-development and educators from other Latin American countries, so that &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; could be broadcast throughout Central and South America, including the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.

The third season, which was filmed in 1983 and consisted of 130 half-hour episodes, had different goals than the previous seasons. One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene, &quot;a matter of critical importance in an area of the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high&quot;. The third season of the show included characters created to &quot;expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models&quot;. The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity, in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes, demonstrating different career options for both men and women, and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities. They cast performers in two different families. The first family was more traditional and consisted of a middle-aged couple named Tono, a mechanic (played by Maurico Herrara), and Alicia, a public health nurse (Alicia de Bari), who had two children. The adults in the second family were young working professionals; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home. Other human characters included: Jose, a shopkeeper and his young assistant, a student named Mercedes (Xochiti Vigil): a truck driver played by Tony Diaz; and a pilot (Fernando Balzaretti), who travelled throughout Latin American and came home to tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza. As of 1990, the third season was still airing in reruns.

In 1995, a fourth season of &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; was produced. It featured two new monsters named Lola and Pancho, a larger cast of children, more original music, and a new set designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta. The season focused on a more innovative curriculum, developed by a board of Latin American educators and UNICEF, and included topics such as health, hygiene, safety issues, cooperation, counting, and the alphabet. The producers created outreach materials for Hispanic families, for the purpose of promoting media literacy and helping parents improve their roles as their children&#x27;s first teachers. The fourth season aired in the U.S. because of the large population of Spanish-speakers in the country; it was the first time an original co-production was shown in the U.S. As Gary Knell, an executive at the CTW stated, &quot;Our mission is to educate all kids. And the fact is, in the U.S., especially in cities like Los Angeles, there&#x27;s an enormous number of Spanish-speaking households&quot;.

The fourth season was test-marketed for American audiences in April on PBS and Univision stations in Miami, Dallas–Fort Worth, and Los Angeles. The test-run was successful, so PBS and Univision began airing it nationally in December; it reached 92% of the country&#x27;s Spanish-speaking households. At first, &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot;″s producers were concerned that the show would be attacked, but &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that &quot;even some staunch opponents of bilingual education concede that &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; has its merits&quot;. &quot;The L.A. Times&quot; also stated that its broadcast in the U.S. was an acknowledgment that Spanish was a prominent language in the U.S. and that more children were bilingual. The show&#x27;s supporters believed that exposure to an educational program like &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; would result in the transfer of Spanish skills to English and increase literacy in both languages. Bilingual education opponents disagreed, but were not against the show&#x27;s entertainment value. According to Knell, the CTW found that watching the Spanish version did not draw children away from the English version.

In 2012, &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; celebrated its 40th anniversary with the creation of a new website and a traveling photo exhibit. In December 2013, the show&#x27;s 15th season premiered with 52 episodes. Segments were shot throughout Latin America; it was the first time the show was filmed in Colombia. Its curriculum focused on math, literacy, diversity, and health. A stakeholders meeting was convened in Bogotá in October 2012, consisting of interested parties from government and the private sector, and included officials from UNICEF.
In 2016, episodes began to debut on HBO Latino, as part of a five-year deal running from January 16, 2016 to July 11, 2020. All songs are left undubbed from English. That same year, &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; (alongside its Brazilian counterpart Víla Sesamo) shortened its name to simply &quot;Sésamo&quot; and fully moved to Colombia. Three seasons have been produced as of December 2017, with a total of 65 episodes. A fourth season, made exclusively for Azteca 7 debuted on April 27, 2020. The season mostly features dubbed segments from Season 50 of its American counterpart.

== Influence ==
When &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot;″s first season premiered, it was the highest rated TV program ever broadcast in Mexico. The UPI reported that all three seasons of the show had some of the highest ratings in Mexico; its second season, which premiered in 1975, &quot;had piled on ratings that only Mexico&#x27;s popular soap operas could rival&quot;. Gettas claimed that &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; was &quot;the model for all subsequent &quot;Sesame Street&quot; co-productions throughout the world&quot;. He also stated that the first season &quot;had a demonstrable impact on the educational achievement levels of its young audience&quot;. In 1974, a study was conducted by American and Mexican researchers that studied the effect of &quot;Plaza Sésamo&quot; on its viewers. Highly significant differences were found in tests about general knowledge, letters, and numbers after children were exposed to the show.  Significant gains were made in several cognitive and perceptual areas by regular viewers, even in subjects that were not taught by the show.

Seasons 1 to onwards from &quot;Sesame Street&quot; were dubbed into Mexican (Latin American) Spanish.

In 1995, Parque Plaza Sésamo, a 12-acre theme park based on the show, was opened in Monterrey, Mexico, within the gates of the theme park Parque Fundidora. It is the first theme park of its kind in Mexico. According to a press release announcing its opening, Parque Plaza Sésamo includes water rides, live entertainment, interactive, and educational elements. It is privately owned, with Mexican investments, and features the show&#x27;s characters, along with the American &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, via a licensing agreement with Sesame Workshop. The park&#x27;s focus audience is around northern Mexico and South Texas. On May 18, 2022, the park announced that it would rebrand as Parque Fiesta Aventuras for the 2022 season following a two-year period of closure. The reason for the rebranding was not classified by the park, but is likely that the park terminated its license to use the Plaza Sésamo branding and characters.

In 2003, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the Sesame Workshop collaborated in a program promoting vaccinations. Their promotion reached over 147 million children and adults. In 2007, the Workshop participated in an extensive health promotion in Mexico; they put many of the characters of &quot;Plaza Sésamo &quot;on milk containers, which were given to schools, with positive messages about nutrition and exercise. Studies showed that the promotion was effective. Children choose healthy food associated with the show&#x27;s characters, and 68 percent of families exposed to the promotion reported positive changes in their children&#x27;s nutrition and hygiene habits. In 2009, the Workshop was awarded the &quot;Champion of Health&quot; award by PAHO for its efforts. In response to a flu pandemic in Mexico, various national celebrities appeared in public service announcements with the &quot;Plaza&quot; Muppets, discussing flu prevention.

<text>Julius Lothar Meyer (19 August 1830 – 11 April 1895) was a German chemist. He was one of the pioneers in developing the earliest versions of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (his chief rival) and he had both worked with Robert Bunsen. Meyer never used his first given name and was known throughout his life simply as Lothar Meyer.

==Career==
Meyer was born in Varel, Germany (then part of the Duchy of Oldenburg). He was the son of Friedrich August Meyer, a physician, and Anna Biermann. After attending the Altes Gymnasium in Oldenburg, he studied medicine at the University of Zurich in 1851. Two years later, he studied pathology at the University of Würzburg as a student of Rudolf Virchow. At Zurich, he had studied under Carl Ludwig, which had prompted him to devote his attention to physiological chemistry. After graduating as a Doctor of Medicine from Würzburg in 1854, he went to Heidelberg University, where Robert Bunsen held the chair of chemistry. In 1858, he received a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Breslau with a thesis on the effects of carbon monoxide on the blood. With this interest in the physiology of respiration, he had recognized that oxygen combines with the hemoglobin in blood.

Influenced by the mathematical teaching of Gustav Kirchhoff, he took up the study of mathematical physics at the University of Königsberg under Franz Ernst Neumann and in 1859, after having received his habilitation (certification for university teaching), became &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in physics and chemistry at the University of Breslau. In 1866, Meyer accepted a post at the Eberswalde Forestry Academy at Neustadt-Eberswalde but two years later was appointed to a professorship at the Karlsruhe Polytechnic.

In 1872, Meyer was the first to suggest that the six carbon atoms in the benzene ring (that had been proposed a few years earlier by August Kekulé) were interconnected by single bonds only, the fourth valence of each carbon atom being directed toward the interior of the ring.

During the Franco-Prussian War, the Polytechnic was used as a hospital and Meyer took an active role in the care of the wounded. In 1876, Meyer became Professor of Chemistry at the University of Tübingen, where he served until his death from a stroke on 11 April 1895 at the age of 64.

==Periodic table==
Meyer is best known for his part in the periodic classification of the elements. He noted, as John A. R. Newlands did in England, that if the elements were arranged in the order of their atomic weights, they fell into groups of similar chemical and physical properties repeated at periodic intervals. According to him, if the atomic weights were plotted as ordinates and the atomic volumes as abscissae—the curve obtained a series of maxima and minima—the most electro-positive elements appearing at the peaks of the curve in the order of their atomic weights.


His book, &quot;Die modernen Theorien der Chemie&quot;, which he began writing in Breslau in 1862 and published two years later, contained an early version of the periodic table. It contained 28 elements, grouping them for the first time into six families by their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight, until then had been stymied by the widespread use of equivalent weights for the elements, rather than atomic weights.

He published articles about classification table of the elements in horizontal form (1864) and vertical form (1870), in which the series of periods are properly ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group.

== Table of Meyer, 1864 ==
== Table of Meyer, 1870 ==

In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev published a periodic table of all elements known at that time (he later predicted several new elements to complete the table, and corrected some atomic weights). A few months later, Meyer published a paper that included a revised version of his 1864 table that now included virtually all of the known elements, which was similar to the table published by Mendeleev:


Meyer had developed his fuller periodic table independently, but he acknowledged Mendeleev&#x27;s priority. Included in Meyer&#x27;s paper was a line chart of atomic volumes as a function of atomic weights, showing graphically the periodicity of the elements. Like Mendeleev, he also included predictions of future elements, but unlike Mendeleev did not emphasize these predictions nor suggest details of the physical and chemical properties of the future elements.

In 1882, both Meyer and Mendeleev received the Davy Medal from the Royal Society in recognition of their work on the Periodic Law.

The mineral lotharmeyerite, , was discovered in 1983 and named in recognition of Meyer&#x27;s work on the Periodic Law. The type locality is the Ojuela mine, Mapimí, Durango, Mexico. Four closely related minerals have been described since 1983: ferrilotharmeyerite (1992); cobaltlotharmeyerite (1997); nickellotharmeyerite (1999); and manganlotharmeyerite (2002).

==Personal life==
Meyer married Johanna Volkmann in 1866.

==Tribute==
On 19 August 2020, Google celebrated his 190th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>Book signing is the affixing of a signature to the title page or flyleaf of a book by its author. Book signings are events, usually at a bookstore or library, where an author sits and signs books for a period.

==Book signing==
Book signing is popular because an author&#x27;s signature increases the value of books for collectors. The author may add a short message to the reader, called a dedication, to each book, which may be personalized with the recipient&#x27;s name upon request. A simple author&#x27;s signature without a dedication is typically more valuable to collectors (exceptions include inscriptions to persons of note, e.g., from Hemingway to Fitzgerald, or to persons of significance in the author&#x27;s life).

Sometimes an author will sign additional copies for future sale. An additional advantage to authors for doing this is that once a book has been signed, it cannot be returned to the publisher for a refund.

Many authors today spend a great deal of time signing their books, and sign many thousands of copies. For example, John Green signed all 150,000 copies of the first printing of his 2012 novel &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot;.

The growing popularity of ebooks and ereading devices has inspired the development of software — such as Authorgraph (formerly known as Kindlegraph and renamed to reflect its expansion to include all ereading platforms), and Autography (for iOS devices) - that allows authors to digitally personalize ebooks, by including autographs, dedications, and photographs, and to provide such personalization remotely as well as at in-person book signings. Such software benefits authors, &quot;who are not obliged to go on long distance promotional tours in order to autograph e-books for their fans&quot;, as well as those readers who are unwilling or unable to brave crowds and longs lines at onsite book signings. Before such applications were introduced, efforts to bridge the digital divide for those who read ebooks included having authors sign the backs of their fan&#x27;s ereading devices or sign ebooks via direct stylus input (e.g., on a Sony Reader Touch or Palm eReader).

==Book signings==
Book signings provide more than just a chance to obtain signatures. Authors and bookstores are benefited by the fact that many copies of the book being promoted are sold at these events. Signings also increase public goodwill and allow authors to connect with their fans. For fans, signings provide a chance to see and meet a favorite author and ask them questions.

The development of social media platforms allows modern day authors to conduct virtual book signings. For example, The GoodReader and Autography jointly hosted an ebook signing with author HP Mallory, during which Mallory greeted fans via Spreecast, a social connectivity platform that allows users to have up to four guests on video chat at one time, to conduct Q&amp;A sessions with even more participants, and to maintain a channel on the site, thereby recording and storing the Spreecast and assigning the recordings a URL for sharing at other outlets. 

Many authors use the book signing platform LiveSigning to host large-scale, streaming video book signings with their fans. Donald Trump hosted a book signing on this platform during his presidential campaign in December 2015. Book signings on LiveSigning typically consist of the author signing books, answering questions from fans, and making phone calls to some fans. After the event, the signed books are mailed to everyone who purchased a signed copy.

<text>Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) is a domain of software tools used to design and implement applications. CASE tools are similar to and are partly inspired by computer-aided design (CAD) tools used for designing hardware products. CASE tools are intended to help develop high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software. CASE software was often associated with methods for the development of information systems together with automated tools that could be used in the software development process.

== History ==
The Information System Design and Optimization System (ISDOS) project, started in 1968 at the University of Michigan, initiated a great deal of interest in the whole concept of using computer systems to help analysts in the very difficult process of analysing requirements and developing systems. Several papers by Daniel Teichroew fired a whole generation of enthusiasts with the potential of automated systems development. His Problem Statement Language / Problem Statement Analyzer (PSL/PSA) tool was a CASE tool although it predated the term.

Another major thread emerged as a logical extension to the data dictionary of a database. By extending the range of metadata held, the attributes of an application could be held within a dictionary and used at runtime. This &quot;active dictionary&quot; became the precursor to the more modern model-driven engineering capability. However, the active dictionary did not provide a graphical representation of any of the metadata. It was the linking of the concept of a dictionary holding analysts&#x27; metadata, as derived from the use of an integrated set of techniques, together with the graphical representation of such data that gave rise to the earlier versions of CASE.

The next entrant into the market was Excelerator from Index Technology in Cambridge, Mass. While DesignAid ran on Convergent Technologies and later Burroughs Ngen networked microcomputers, Index launched Excelerator on the IBM PC/AT platform. While, at the time of launch, and for several years, the IBM platform did not support networking or a centralized database as did the Convergent Technologies or Burroughs machines, the allure of IBM was strong, and Excelerator came to prominence. Hot on the heels of Excelerator were a rash of offerings from companies such as Knowledgeware (James Martin, Fran Tarkenton and Don Addington), Texas Instrument&#x27;s CA Gen and Andersen Consulting&#x27;s FOUNDATION toolset (DESIGN/1, INSTALL/1, FCP).

CASE tools were at their peak in the early 1990s. According to the PC Magazine of January 1990, over 100 companies were offering nearly 200 different CASE tools. At the time IBM had proposed AD/Cycle, which was an alliance of software vendors centered on IBM&#x27;s Software repository using IBM DB2 in mainframe and OS/2:

:&quot;The application development tools can be from several sources: from IBM, from vendors, and from the customers themselves. IBM has entered into relationships with Bachman Information Systems, Index Technology Corporation, and Knowledgeware wherein selected products from these vendors will be marketed through an IBM complementary marketing program to provide offerings that will help to achieve complete life-cycle coverage&quot;.

With the decline of the mainframe, AD/Cycle and the Big CASE tools died off, opening the market for the mainstream CASE tools of today. Many of the leaders of the CASE market of the early 1990s ended up being purchased by Computer Associates, including IEW, IEF, ADW, Cayenne, and Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems (LBMS). The other trend that led to the evolution of CASE tools was the rise of object-oriented methods and tools. Most of the various tool vendors added some support for object-oriented methods and tools. In addition new products arose that were designed from the bottom up to support the object-oriented approach. Andersen developed its project Eagle as an alternative to Foundation. Several of the thought leaders in object-oriented development each developed their own methodology and CASE tool set: Jacobson, Rumbaugh, Booch, etc. Eventually, these diverse tool sets and methods were consolidated via standards led by the Object Management Group (OMG). The OMG&#x27;s Unified Modelling Language (UML) is currently widely accepted as the industry standard for object-oriented modeling.

== CASE software ==
=== Tools ===
CASE tools support specific tasks in the software development life-cycle. They can be divided into the following categories:
# Business and analysis modeling: Graphical modeling tools. E.g., E/R modeling, object modeling, etc.
# Development: Design and construction phases of the life-cycle. Debugging environments. E.g., IISE LKO.
# Verification and validation: Analyze code and specifications for correctness, performance, etc.
# Configuration management: Control the check-in and check-out of repository objects and files. E.g., SCCS, IISE.
# Metrics and measurement: Analyze code for complexity, modularity (e.g., no &quot;go to&#x27;s&quot;), performance, etc. 
# Project management: Manage project plans, task assignments, scheduling.

Another common way to distinguish CASE tools is the distinction between Upper CASE and Lower CASE. Upper CASE Tools support business and analysis modeling. They support traditional diagrammatic languages such as ER diagrams, Data flow diagram, Structure charts, Decision Trees, Decision tables, etc. Lower CASE Tools support development activities, such as physical design, debugging, construction, testing, component integration, maintenance, and reverse engineering. All other activities span the entire life-cycle and apply equally to upper and lower CASE.

=== Workbenches ===
Workbenches integrate two or more CASE tools and support specific software-process activities. Hence they achieve:
*A homogeneous and consistent interface (presentation integration)
*Seamless integration of tools and toolchains (control and data integration)

An example workbench is Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic programming environment. It incorporates several development tools: a GUI builder, a smart code editor, debugger, etc. Most commercial CASE products tended to be such workbenches that seamlessly integrated two or more tools. Workbenches also can be classified in the same manner as tools; as focusing on Analysis, Development, Verification, etc. as well as being focused on the upper case, lower case, or processes such as configuration management that span the complete life-cycle.

=== Environments ===
An environment is a collection of CASE tools or workbenches that attempts to support the complete software process. This contrasts with tools that focus on one specific task or a specific part of the life-cycle. CASE environments are classified by Fuggetta as follows:
# Toolkits: Loosely coupled collections of tools. These typically build on operating system workbenches such as the Unix Programmer&#x27;s Workbench or the VMS VAX set. They typically perform integration via piping or some other basic mechanism to share data and pass control. The strength of easy integration is also one of the drawbacks. Simple passing of parameters via technologies such as shell scripting can&#x27;t provide the kind of sophisticated integration that a common repository database can. 
# Fourth generation: These environments are also known as 4GL standing for fourth generation language environments due to the fact that the early environments were designed around specific languages such as Visual Basic. They were the first environments to provide deep integration of multiple tools. Typically these environments were focused on specific types of applications. For example, user-interface driven applications that did standard atomic transactions to a relational database. Examples are Informix 4GL, and Focus.
# Language-centered: Environments based on a single often object-oriented language such as the Symbolics Lisp Genera environment or VisualWorks Smalltalk from Parcplace. In these environments all the operating system resources were objects in the object-oriented language. This provides powerful debugging and graphical opportunities but the code developed is mostly limited to the specific language. For this reason, these environments were mostly a niche within CASE. Their use was mostly for prototyping and R&amp;D projects. A common core idea for these environments was the model–view–controller user interface that facilitated keeping multiple presentations of the same design consistent with the underlying model. The MVC architecture was adopted by the other types of CASE environments as well as many of the applications that were built with them. 
# Integrated: These environments are an example of what most IT people tend to think of first when they think of CASE. Environments such as IBM&#x27;s AD/Cycle, Andersen Consulting&#x27;s FOUNDATION, the ICL CADES system, and DEC Cohesion. These environments attempt to cover the complete life-cycle from analysis to maintenance and provide an integrated database repository for storing all artifacts of the software process. The integrated software repository was the defining feature for these kinds of tools. They provided multiple different design models as well as support for code in heterogenous languages. One of the main goals for these types of environments was &quot;round trip engineering&quot;: being able to make changes at the design level and have those automatically be reflected in the code and vice versa. These environments were also typically associated with a particular methodology for software development. For example, the FOUNDATION CASE suite from Andersen was closely tied to the Andersen Method/1 methodology.
# Process-centered: This is the most ambitious type of integration. These environments attempt to not just formally specify the analysis and design objects of the software process but the actual process itself and to use that formal process to control and guide software projects. Examples are East, Enterprise II, Process Wise, Process Weaver, and Arcadia. These environments were by definition tied to some methodology since the software process itself is part of the environment and can control many aspects of tool invocation.

In practice, the distinction between workbenches and environments was flexible. Visual Basic for example was a programming workbench but was also considered a 4GL environment by many. The features that distinguished workbenches from environments were deep integration via a shared repository or common language and some kind of methodology (integrated and process-centered environments) or domain (4GL) specificity.

== Major CASE risk factors ==
Some of the most significant risk factors for organizations adopting CASE technology include: 
* Inadequate standardization: Organizations usually have to tailor and adopt methodologies and tools to their specific requirements. Doing so may require significant effort to integrate both divergent technologies as well as divergent methods. For example, before the adoption of the UML standard the diagram conventions and methods for designing object-oriented models were vastly different among followers of Jacobsen, Booch, and Rumbaugh. 
* Unrealistic expectations: The proponents of CASE technology—especially vendors marketing expensive tool sets—often hype expectations that the new approach will be a silver bullet that solves all problems. In reality no such technology can do that and if organizations approach CASE with unrealistic expectations they will inevitably be disappointed. 
* Inadequate training: As with any new technology, CASE requires time to train people in how to use the tools and to get up to speed with them. CASE projects can fail if practitioners are not given adequate time for training or if the first project attempted with the new technology is itself highly mission critical and fraught with risk. 
* Inadequate process control: CASE provides significant new capabilities to utilize new types of tools in innovative ways. Without the proper process guidance and controls these new capabilities can cause significant new problems as well.

<text>The Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union (BECTU), formerly the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematograph and Theatre Union, is a former British trade union, became a sector of the Prospect trade union in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2017 following the transfer of engagements of BECTU to Prospect. It has approximately 40,000 members who work in broadcasting, film, theatre, IT, telecoms, entertainment, leisure and interactive media.

==History==
BECTU was founded in 1991 with the merger of the Association of Cinematograph Television and Allied Technicians and the Broadcasting and Entertainment Trades Alliance, the history of which can be traced back to 1890. In July 1995, the Film Artistes&#x27; Association (FAA), founded in 1927 as a trade union for film extras merged to become a sub-division of BECTU.

BECTU&#x27;s affiliations included the Trades Union Congress, the Scottish Trades Union Congress, Union Network International, the General Federation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Entertainment Unions.

Gerry Morrissey was elected General Secretary in February 2007, after the position had been left vacant due to the death of Roger Bolton, who died from cancer in November 2006.

===Merger into Prospect===
BECTU announced in 2014 that it was in merger talks with the Prospect trade union which represents engineers, managers, scientists and other specialists in both the public and private sectors in the UK. Prospect is not currently affiliated to any political party. At the Bectu Annual Conference held on 14 May 2016 it was agreed to ballot Bectu members on the proposed merger with Prospect.
It was announced on 30 August 2016 that BECTU members had overwhelmingly voted Yes to the merger with Prospect which took place on 1 January 2017. BECTU became a sector of Prospect, with Morrissey continuing to lead the sector. In 2018, Philippa Childs took over as secretary of the sector.

<text>Monford Merrill &quot;Monte&quot; Irvin (February 25, 1919 – January 11, 2016) was an American left fielder and right fielder in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball (MLB) who played with the Newark Eagles (1938–1942, 1946–1948), New York Giants (1949–1955) and Chicago Cubs (1956). He grew up in New Jersey and was a standout football player at Lincoln University. Irvin left Lincoln to spend several seasons in Negro league baseball. His career was interrupted by military service from 1943 to 1945.

When he joined the New York Giants, Irvin became one of the earliest African-American MLB players. He played in two World Series for the Giants. When future Hall of Famer Willie Mays joined the Giants in 1951, Irvin was asked to mentor him. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973. After his playing career, Irvin was a baseball scout and held an administrative role with the MLB commissioner&#x27;s office.

At the time of his death, Irvin was the oldest living former Negro Leagues player, New York Giant and Chicago Cub. He lived in a retirement community in Houston before his death.

==Early life==
Irvin was born February 25, 1919, in Haleburg, Alabama, the eighth of 13 children, and brother of fellow Negro leaguer Cal Irvin. As a child, he moved with his family to Orange, New Jersey. At Orange High School, he starred in four sports, earning a total of 16 varsity letters and setting a state record in the javelin throw. Irvin played baseball for the Orange Triangles, the local semiprofessional team, and he credited its coach with giving him an activity that helped him to stay out of trouble. He was offered a football scholarship to the University of Michigan, but he had to turn it down because he did not have enough money to move to Ann Arbor.

Irvin attended Lincoln University and was a star football player. However, he had disagreements with his coach and he found that he could not remain on his athletic scholarship and pursue pre-dentistry studies. As his frustration mounted, Irvin began to be recruited by Negro league baseball teams.

==Negro league and Mexican League career==
Irvin played for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League in 1938. Larry Doby, the first player to break the color barrier in the American League, was Irvin&#x27;s double play partner with Newark at one time. After hitting for high batting averages of .422 and .396 (1940–41), Irvin asked for a raise before the 1942 season. When that was denied, he left the Negro leagues for the Mexican League, where he won a triple crown; he had a .397 batting average and 20 home runs in 63 games.

===World War II===
Following the 1942 Mexican League season, Irvin was drafted into military service. Joining the army&#x27;s GS Engineers, 1313th Battalion, for the next three years, Irvin was deployed to England, France, and Belgium, and he served in the Battle of the Bulge. Irvin said that while many black soldiers had been treated badly by their white counterparts, the situation improved for black soldiers as many white soldiers realized the contradiction in an oppressed group being sent to Europe to fight for the oppressed people in other countries. Irvin&#x27;s military service left him with ringing in the ears, which affected his coordination.

===Return to baseball===
After World War II, Irvin was approached by Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey about being signed for the major leagues, but Irvin felt he was not ready to play at that level so soon after leaving the service. The Newark Eagles business manager, Effa Manley, would not let Rickey sign Irvin without compensation. Rickey had already obtained Jackie Robinson without paying for his rights to his Negro league clubs. Said Irvin,

 ... from a purely business standpoint, Mrs. Manley felt that Branch Rickey was obligated to compensate her for my contract. That position probably delayed my entry into the major leagues ... Mrs. Manley told Rickey that he had taken Don Newcombe for no money but she wasn&#x27;t going to let him take me without some compensation. Furthermore, if he tried to do it, she would sue and fight him in court ... Rickey contacted her to say he was no longer interested released me ... the Giants picked up my contract ...
Irvin earned MVP honors in the 1945–46 Puerto Rican Winter League. He returned to the Newark Eagles in 1946 to lead his team to a league pennant. Irvin won his second batting championship, hitting .401, and was instrumental in beating the Kansas City Monarchs in a seven-game Negro League World Series, batting .462 with three home runs. He was a five-time Negro League All-Star (1941, 1946–1948, including two games in 1946). He spent the winter of 1948–49 in Cuba.

==MLB career==
In 1949, the New York Giants paid $5,000 for Irvin&#x27;s contract. He was one of the first black players to be signed, as Jackie Robinson had only broken the MLB color line in 1947. Assigned to Jersey City of the International League, Irvin batted .373. He debuted with the Giants on July 8, 1949, as a pinch hitter. Back with Jersey City in 1950, he was called up after hitting .510 with ten home runs in 18 games. Irvin batted .299 for the Giants that season, playing first base and the outfield.

In 1951, Irvin sparked the Giants&#x27; miraculous comeback to overtake the Dodgers in the pennant race, batting .312 with 24 homers and a league-best 121 runs batted in (RBI), en route to the World Series (he went 11–24 for .458). In the third game of the playoff between the Giants and Dodgers, Irvin popped out in the bottom of the ninth inning before Bobby Thomson hit the Shot Heard &#x27;Round the World. That year Irvin teamed with Hank Thompson and Willie Mays to form the first all-black outfield in the majors. Later, he finished third in the NL&#x27;s MVP voting.

During that season, Giants manager Leo Durocher asked Irvin to serve as a mentor for Mays, who had been called up to the team in May. Mays later said, &quot;In my time, when I was coming up, you had to have some kind of guidance. And Monte was like my brother ... I couldn&#x27;t go anywhere without him, especially on the road ... It was just a treat to be around him. I didn&#x27;t understand life in New York until I met Monte. He knew everything about what was going on and he protected me dearly.&quot; Irvin later replied, &quot;I did that for two years and in the third year he started showing me around.&quot;

Irvin suffered a broken ankle during a spring training game in Denver in 1952, jamming his ankle on third base while sliding. &quot;It was a horrible thing to see,&quot; reported Mays. However, Irvin returned in time to be named to his only Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1952. He appeared in only 46 games that season, hitting .310 with four home runs and 21 RBI. Irvin hit .329 with 21 home runs and 97 RBI in 1953, finishing 15th in the league MVP voting. The following season, he hit .262 with 19 home runs and 64 RBI, with the Giants winning the pennant and facing the Cleveland Indians in the 1954 World Series. Irvin was in left field when Mays, playing center field, made &quot;The Catch&quot; on a deep drive off the bat of Vic Wertz in Game 1. The Giants went on to win the Series in four games, with Irvin collecting two hits in nine at bats.

In 1955, Irvin had been sent down to the minor leagues, where he hit 14 home runs in 75 games for the Minneapolis Millers. The Chicago Cubs signed him before the 1956 season. The team said that he would compete with Hank Sauer for a starting position in left field. Irvin appeared in 111 games for the Cubs that year, hitting .271 with 15 home runs.

A back injury led to Irvin&#x27;s retirement as a player in 1957. He sustained the injury during spring training that year and only appeared in four minor league games for the Los Angeles Angels of the Pacific Coast League. In his major league career, Irvin batted .293, with 99 home runs, 443 RBI, 366 runs scored, 731 hits, 97 doubles, 31 triples, and 28 stolen bases, with 351 walks for a .383 on-base percentage, and 1187 total bases for a .475 slugging average in 764 games played. Defensively, Irvin recorded a .981 fielding percentage.

==Later life==
Monte appeared on an episode of &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot; dated May 22, 1961, in which he impersonated a judo champion.
After retiring, Irvin worked as a representative for the Rheingold beer company, and later as a scout for the New York Mets from 1967 to 1968. He was named an MLB public relations specialist for the commissioner&#x27;s office under Bowie Kuhn in 1968. The appointment made him the first black executive in professional baseball. He was elected to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972. The next year, he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, primarily on the basis of his play in the Negro leagues.

In 1974, Kuhn was present in Cincinnati when Hank Aaron tied Babe Ruth&#x27;s record of 714 career home runs. When the team came back to Atlanta, Kuhn sent Irvin in his place, so Kuhn was not present for Aaron&#x27;s 715th home run. Even as late as 1980, Aaron was so angry at Kuhn that he did not attend an event where Kuhn was to present him with an award.

Irvin stepped down from his role in the commissioner&#x27;s office when Kuhn announced his retirement in 1984. He retired to Homosassa, Florida, but he accepted an MLB role involving special projects and appearances.

On May 16, 2006, Orange Park in the city of Orange, New Jersey was renamed Monte Irvin Park, in his honor.
On June 26, 2010, the San Francisco Giants officially retired his number 20 uniform. He was joined by fellow Hall of Famers Willie Mays, Willie McCovey, Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry and Orlando Cepeda in the pre-game ceremony. He later joined those same Giants Hall of Famers in throwing out the ceremonial first pitch of Game 1 of 2010 World Series. In 2015, he was presented a 2014 World Series ring by Giants executives and later joined the Giants in visiting the White House.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Irvin as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Army during World War II.

On January 11, 2016, Irvin died of natural causes in Houston at age 96. At the time of his death, Irvin was the oldest living African American to have played in the major leagues, as well as the oldest living member of a World Series-winning team. Before his death, he lived in a retirement community in Houston. He also served on the Veterans Committee of the Hall of Fame. The Giants wore a patch in his memory for the 2016 season, a black circle with an orange outline with &quot;Monte&quot; on top of his number 20, to be worn on the left sleeve.

On October 19, 2016, a life-sized bronze statue of Irvin was dedicated in Monte Irvin Park in Orange, New Jersey.

In 2021, Irvin was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

==Career statistics==

===Negro leagues===
The first official statistics for the Negro leagues were compiled as part of a statistical study sponsored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and supervised by Larry Lester and Dick Clark, in which a research team collected statistics from thousands of box-scores of league-sanctioned games. The first results from this study were the statistics for Negro League Hall of Famers elected before 2006, which were published in &quot;Shades of Glory&quot; by Lawrence D. Hogan. These statistics include the official Negro league statistics for Monte Irvin:

<doc id="627083" wikidata="Q544106" url="?curid=627083" title="Cenwalh of Wessex">
<text>Cenwalh, also Cenwealh or Coenwalh, was King of Wessex from c. 642 to c. 645 and from c. 648 until his death, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, in c. 672.

== Penda and Anna ==
Bede states that Cenwalh was the son of the King Cynegils baptised by Bishop Birinus. He was also the great-great-grandson of Cerdic. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; offers several ancestries for Cynegils, and the relationship of Cynegils and Cenwalh to later kings isn&#x27;t certain. It has been noted that the name Cenwalh is of British rather than Anglo-Saxon etymology. Although Cynegils is said to have been a convert to Christianity, Bede writes that Cenwalh:refused to embrace the mysteries of the faith, and of the heavenly kingdom; and not long after also he lost the dominion of his earthly kingdom; for he put away the sister of Penda, king of the Mercians, whom he had married, and took another wife; whereupon a war ensuing, he was by him expelled his kingdom...

Cenwalh took refuge with the Christian king Anna of East Anglia and was baptised while in exile, although the date of his exile is uncertain. Bede says that it lasted three years, but does not give the dates. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; reports that he granted lands at Ashdown to a kinsman named Cuthred. If this is the same Cuthred whose death is reported around 661, then he was perhaps a son of King Cwichelm or a grandson of Cynegils, if indeed King Cwichelm was not also a son of Cynegils.

None of the West Saxon dates give any clear evidence for the period of Cenwalh&#x27;s exile, but since King Anna was killed by Penda in 654, and exiled from East Anglia by him in 651 (according to the contemporary &quot;Additamentum Nivialensis&quot;), Cenwalh&#x27;s exile cannot have begun much later than 648. Furthermore, if (as William of Malmesbury states) Cenwalh was baptised by Saint Felix, this must have occurred by c. 647. Cenwalh&#x27;s repudiation of Penda&#x27;s sister therefore followed fairly closely upon Penda&#x27;s killing of Oswald of Northumbria at Maserfeld in 642, Oswald being the godfather of Cynegils, and husband of Cenwalh&#x27;s sister Cyneburh, and thus the protector of Cynegils&#x27;s line in Wessex. Penda was killed at the Battle of Winwaed on 15 November 655. Barbara Yorke suggests that Cenwalh returned to power in 648, D.P. Kirby places his exile in the 650s.

== Origins of Christian Wessex ==
When Cenwalh returned to power, his Bishop in Dorchester-on-Thames was the Frank Agilbert. Bede states:At length the king, who understood none but the language of the Saxons, grown weary of that bishop&#x27;s barbarous tongue, brought into the province another bishop of his own nation, whose name was Wini, who had been ordained in France; and dividing his province into two dioceses, appointed this last his episcopal see in the city of Winchester, by the Saxons called Wintancestir.

The new diocese of Winchester, in lands formerly belonging to the Jutes (who were thereafter confined to the Isle of Wight) lay in the heart of the future Wessex. The ravaging of Ashdown by Penda&#x27;s son Wulfhere c. 661, in the original lands of the Gewisse, suggests that this movement was brought about by sustained Mercian pressure on the Saxons.

Wulfhere advanced as far south as the Isle of Wight, and detached the Meon valley from Cenwalh&#x27;s kingdom, giving it to his godson Æthelwalh, King of the South Saxons. At around this time, the Mercian prince Frithuwold was ruling Surrey and Berkshire. Wulfhere&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Ecgfrith in 674 freed the southern kingdoms from Mercian control, and Wulfhere was defeated the following year by the West Saxons, led by Æscwine.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records a battle between Cenwalh and the Britons in its entry for 658: &quot;Here Cenwalh fought at Peonnum against the Wealas and caused them to flee as far as the Parret&quot;. The advance into the British south-west is obscure, but Cenwalh&#x27;s relations with the Britons were not uniformly hostile. He is reported to have endowed the British monastery at Sherborne, in Dorset, while the early Anglo-Saxon missionary Saint Boniface is said to have been born in Crediton, Devon, and educated at a formerly British monastery near Exeter.

Whether Cenwalh ruled alone in Wessex is uncertain. Earlier kings appear to have shared rulership, and Cenberht, father of the future King Caedwalla, may have ruled together with Cenwalh rather than being merely a sub-king.

In 665–668, Cenwalh quarreled with Bishop Wini, who sought refuge with the Mercian king Wulfhere, which D.P. Kirby takes to be a sign of Wulfhere&#x27;s influence. By this time, the Bishop at Dorchester was the Mercian-backed Ætla, and Thame was a possession of Wulfhere&#x27;s.

According to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, Cenwalh died in 672 and was succeeded by his widow, Seaxburh, who held power for about a year.

== Descendants ==
No later kings of the West Saxons are known to be descended from Cenwalh, indeed no descendants of his are known. King Centwine is said to have been his brother, but Kirby notes the circumstantial evidence which makes this unlikely.

However, if no descendants of Cenwalh held the throne in Wessex, it may be that his descendants held power in Mercia and Kent in the 9th century. The Mercian kings Coenwulf and Ceolwulf, and their brother Cuthred, King of Kent, claimed descent from an otherwise unknown brother of Penda and Eowa called Coenwalh. It has been suggested that Cenwalh was this Coenwalh, brother-in-law, rather than brother, of Penda and Eowa.

<text>The Intel Developer Forum (IDF) was a biannual gathering of technologists to discuss Intel products and products based on Intel products. The first IDF was held in 1997.

To emphasize the importance of China, the Spring 2007 IDF was held in Beijing instead of San Francisco, and San Francisco and Taipei shared the Fall IDF event in September and October, respectively. Three IDF shows were scheduled in 2008; with the date of IDF San Francisco notably moving to August rather than September. In previous years, events were held in major cities around the world such as San Francisco, Mumbai, Bangalore, Moscow, Cairo, São Paulo, Amsterdam, Munich and Tokyo.

On April 17, 2017, Intel announced that it would no longer be hosting IDF. As a result of this announcement, IDF17, which was scheduled for August in San Francisco, was canceled.

<text>A capon (from , genitive &quot;cāpōnis&quot;) is a male chicken that has been castrated or neutered, either physically or chemically, to improve the quality of its flesh for food, and, in some countries like Spain, fattened by forced feeding.

==History==

The origins of caponised chickens are contested. They were known in ancient China as well as in ancient Greece and ancient Rome.

An early record of caponisation is found under the Roman Republic: the Lex Fannia of 162 BC forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations, so the Romans instead castrated roosters, which resulted in a doubling of size. 
It was also practiced later throughout medieval times, with gastronomic texts describing capons as preferred poultry since the ordinary fowl of the farmyard was regarded as peasant fare and &quot;popular malice crediting monks with a weakness for capons.&quot;

In the early 20th century, France was internationally renowned for maintaining a strong caponisation tradition with widespread and established industries throughout the country.

William Shakespeare mentioned capon in the famous &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage&quot; monologue from his play &quot;As You Like It&quot; (written c.1600). He similarly describes capon as a food of the wealthy. The monologue describes human life as consisting of seven stages, and the fifth stage is a middle-aged man who has reached the point where he has acquired wisdom and wealth. The monologue describes the fifth stage as: &quot;The Justice, In fair round belly, with a good capon lin&#x27;d&quot;. In addition his character Sir John Falstaff is described as or implied to be fond of capons.

==Effects of caponisation==

Caponisation is the process of turning a cockerel into a capon. Caponisation can be done by surgically removing the bird&#x27;s testes, or may also be accomplished through the use of estrogen implants. With either method, the male sex hormones normally present are no longer effective. Caponisation must be done before the rooster matures so that it develops without the influence of male sex hormones.

Capons, due to the lack of the male sex drive, are not as aggressive as normal roosters. This makes capons easier to handle and allows capons to be kept together with other capons since their reduced aggression prevents them from fighting.

The lack of sex hormones results in meat that is less in taste. Capon meat is also more moist, tender and flavorful than that of a cockerel or a hen, which is due not only to the hormonal differences during the capon&#x27;s development but also because capons are not as active as roosters, which makes their meat more tender and fatty.

Capons develop a smaller head, comb and wattle than those of a normal rooster.

Capons are fairly rare in industrial meat production. Chickens raised for meat are bred and raised so that they mature very quickly. Industrial chickens can be sent to market in as little as five weeks. Capons produced under these conditions will taste very similar to conventional chicken meat, making their production unnecessary.

==Specialised production==

Capons are produced in France, in several provinces, notably the Gers and Jura regions. They are a speciality of Bresse (Chapon de Bresse), where they have their own appellation to differentiate them from capons from other regions. In Bresse, they are exclusively produced from the Bresse blue foot breed (patte bleue), and fed a certain diet which makes it even more tender than from other regions and breeds, making it a desirable meat.

Capons are also produced in many regions of northern Italy, such as Piedmont, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, and Marche. In the early 20th century, capon was commonly eaten for the main family feast on Christmas in Tuscany and northern Italian regions, which was a rare treat for peasant or working class families.

In the gastronomy of Spain, capons are usually eaten during the Christmas season in the northern regions. Capons of Vilalba and Lugo are particularly famous and are sold all over the country.

In China, capons are often raised specifically for consumption during Chinese New Year.

In Thailand, capons are also used for Hainanese Chicken Rice by established restaurants like Go Kok (in Lat Phrao), An An Lao (in Bangkok&#x27;s Soi Ari / Sukhumvit 26), and the Bangkok branches of Boon Tong Kee, among many other fine Cantonese/Thai-Chinese restaurants.

==Legal status==

In the UK physical caponisation was made illegal in 1982 via The Welfare of Livestock (Prohibited Operations) Regulations 1982. This was reinforced in 2007 by The Mutilations (Permitted Procedures) (England) Regulations 2007 which made castration of all domesticated birds illegal. It is not illegal to import castrated animals and capons are available for sale in the UK.

<doc id="627104" wikidata="Q2410485" url="?curid=627104" title="Sesamstraat">
<text> () is a Dutch television series in the Netherlands, and a localized version of the U.S. children&#x27;s program &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In its early days, the show was broadcast in Flanders (Belgium) as well. It is the second longest-running foreign adaptation of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; without interruptions, behind only . It targets children between 3–7 years old.

==History==
After a pilot episode entitled &quot;Sesamplein&quot; (&quot;Sesame Square&quot;) which was released in 1974, began broadcasting in 1976. It started as a Dutch/Belgian coproduction, with only one thirty-minute episode a week. These episodes had only 12 minutes allotted for the Dutch cast. At the time, there were only two Muppets and three live actors (Piet Hendriks, Sien Diels, and Annet van Heusden). Piet owned a hobby and crafts workshop and a camper which he would drive around The Netherlands and Belgium for live trips. Sien owned a grocery store, where the exchange of knowledge and happenings were as important as the selling of products. Annet played a kindergarten teacher. In 1978, the show&#x27;s format changed to a daily 15 minute show that aired in the evening, around dinnertime.

The first season was shot on location in a half Dutch, half Belgian town. It was broadcast every Sunday for a half-hour in the afternoon. For the second season, a realistic town square was built inside the studio, which slowly evolved into a more abstracted, colourful town, featuring Pino&#x27;s nest, Sien&#x27;s store, a workshop, two houses, an apartment building, a trailer and a treehouse. The insides of the house sets could be decorated in different ways, so that the viewers would never be certain about who lived where.

Other special Sesamstraat episodes include the 2500th episode, and a yearly special episode focused on Sinterklaas. The 25th anniversary of the series featured guest appearances on the street by Dutch celebrities. On January 7, 2000, Prime Minister Wim Kok read the daily story &quot;Er staat een olifantje in het gras...&quot; (There is a little elephant standing in the grass) for the Muppet residents before they went to sleep. Wim Kok is one of the many prominent guests who read a story to them. (Normally this was done by Frank, Gerda or Paula). Other celebrities that have made guest appearances include Freek de Jonge (comedian), Ruud Gullit (professional soccer player), André van Duin (comedian), Mary Dresselhuys (actress), Hans Dagelet (actor), Kees van Kooten (writer), Brigitte Kaandorp (comedian), Sonja Barend (show host) and Janine Kastelijn (Youth Winner for Reading in 2000).

In 1992, a 30-minute film, &quot;Sesamstraat en Melkweg&quot;, was produced for the Artis Zoo Planetarium in Amsterdam.

In 2005, the show saw some schedule trouble. The government decided to halt the funding and broadcasts of NPS. The final debate took place on September 12, 2005, in the Tweede Kamer. It was decided that NPS could continue making programs, but it had to make several changes to fit into modern television, including a new broadcast schedule.

For the 2005/2006 season, &quot;Sesamstraat&quot; moved into new scenery. The set became completely abstract, with toy block-like buildings, broccoli for trees, and a tower with a giant light-up clock. The scenery was introduced with a TV special. Bert, Ernie, Cookie Monster, and Elmo flew over to the Netherlands for this special occasion. It was the first time the American characters visited the Dutch street.

Starting in September 2006, &quot;Sesamstraat&quot; expanded to 30 minutes and began airing three times a day.

In 2008, the show received 15 minutes of extra broadcast time a day. This meant there was room for two more Muppets. Angsthaas and Stuntkip were introduced.

October 2009 brought a new segment for the show. Several famous Dutch singers performed duets with the &quot;Sesamstraat&quot; characters Pino, Tommie, Ieniemienie and Purk. All songs were written by Henny Vrienten. The segments aired every Friday starting October 30, 2009. Among the artists were Trijntje Oosterhuis, Caro Emerald, André van Duin, Edsilia Rombley, Ernst Daniël Smid, Hind, Guus Meeuwis, Huub van der Lubbe and Willeke Alberti. All the duets were broadcast again in a special on December 25 and 28.

On June 28, 2019, The NTR made public that they had to economize again and decided to stop producing the series for the following two years. Reruns were broadcast instead.

==Characters==

===Muppet characters===

====Pino====
Pino is one of the most important Muppets in the children&#x27;s program, and has been a part of the central cast since the show started airing in 1976. He has the appearance of a giant blue bird whose design closely resembles that of Big Bird, who is his cousin. At approximately 4 years old he is a little younger than his friends Tommie and Ieniemienie, and sometimes he has a little trouble keeping up with them. Pino is shy, sensitive, and sometimes clumsy in his childish naivety. Being the second youngest, he likes to play with Purk. He is best known for his funny laugh and his catchphrase &quot;Echt waar?!&quot; (&quot;Really?!&quot;).

Pino has had many different performers through the years, including Dirk Grijspeirt (1976), Theo Joling (1977), Bert Plagman (1979), Erik J. Meijer (1980) and Leo Dijkgraaf (1984). In 1991, Renée Menschaar started performing Pino, and she has been his regular performer ever since. She is the first woman to play Pino, who has always remained a boy character.

====Tommie====
Tommie is a six-year-old dog. He is clever, energetic and creative. Tommie can write a few words, including his own name, which he is very proud of. He is famous for his own made up exclamations, like &quot;Poe hee!&quot; (approximately pronounced as: pooh hey) and &quot;Hatseflats!&quot;. In the 2005/2006 season, Tommie got his own racing car.

Tommie has been around since the beginning in 1976. The first Tommie puppet was made by producer Ton Hasebos from an old fur coat. He was a teddy bear-like creature that walked on all fours. Through the years he evolved from a &#x27;teddy bear&#x27; kind of creature to a more doglike animal. Tommie&#x27;s recent look, which was introduced in 1981, was designed by The Jim Henson Company. The recently refurbished Tommie has a lot more fur in his face.

Like Pino, Tommie has had a few different performers, including Stef van der Linden in 1976 and Martin Pragt in 1978. In 1979, Bert Plagman became Tommie&#x27;s performer, after sharing the part with Martin. Renée Menschaar (Pino&#x27;s performer) and Judith Broersen (Purk&#x27;s performer) both started their Sesamstraat careers as Tommie&#x27;s right hand. Nowadays, Daphne Zandberg performs Tommie&#x27;s right hand.

====Ieniemienie====
Representing the psychological age of a six-year-old mouse, Ieniemienie is the oldest of the group. She is very clever and smart-alecky, and sometimes she tends to be a little bossy. Her best friend is Tommie. Being the smallest rodent on Sesamstraat, she often hangs out with Pino. Ienie is famous for her giggle, as well as her signature movements like scrunching her nose when she&#x27;s angry or raising her shoulders when she&#x27;s confused.

Ieniemienie was introduced in 1980. She started out as a mouse who lived in a hole. Through the years, when female emancipation wasn&#x27;t as much as an issue on the street, her personality became more childlike and girlish.

The puppet has been refurbished a few times, but without drastic changes; except for the 1996 anniversary special, in which Ieniemienie&#x27;s legs were shown for the first time, during a stiltwalking scene.

Ieniemienie&#x27;s performer is Catherine van Woerden. Her arm rods are manipulated by either Marijke Koek or Lindai Boogerman.

====Troel====
Troel is a fluffy white girl poodle. She is very feminine and a little naïve, and she speaks in a high-pitched voice. Troel is the girlfriend of Tommie.

Troel was introduced during the second season in 1977 as the first girl Muppet to star with Tommie and Pino. She was designed to look like a girl version of Tommie.

Troel was performed by Marijke Boon.

Even though the viewers had no problems with her, the producers found her too feminine for a show that dealt with female emancipation, so she disappeared after a year. A newspaper article mentions another reason for her disappearance: her performer didn&#x27;t get paid as much as the male performers.

Troel was replaced by Ieniemienie a couple of years later.

The Dutch word &quot;Troel&quot; means &quot;dear&quot; or &quot;sweetheart&quot; in a more informal, sometimes even negative way.

====Purk====
Purk is a baby piglet who wears a diaper and a little bow in her ear. She is clumsy and messy and loves to get herself dirty. She is still learning how to talk, and she can&#x27;t walk yet. She is taken care of by everyone on Sesamstraat.

Introduced in 2003, Purk is the newest of the Muppet characters. She was created in order to introduce the subject of &quot;a younger child in the family&quot;. While the Dutch wanted her to be fat, they felt that Purk should not be too fat due to the issue of obesity. It took three years for Sesame Workshop to approve the character. The actual puppet was based on a drawing by Sesamstraat actor and mime artist Hakim Traïda.

Purk debuted in a Sesamstraat &quot;Sinterklaas&quot; special as a surprise. In the special, Tommie runs away from Sesamstraat, after the adults gave his stuffed crocodile to Purk. Before the taping of the special, Sesamstraat organised a press convention about Purk&#x27;s &#x27;birth&#x27;, hosted by Tommie and Ieniemienie.

Purk was designed by Ed Christie and built by Rollie Krewson.

===Humans in &quot;Sesamstraat&quot;===
* Buurman Baasje, a grumpy neighbour from the Maanzaadstraat (Poppy Seed Street), hating being disturbed by the people (and especially the Muppets) of Sesamstraat. His (nick)name means literally &quot;Neighbour Bossy&quot;, being so called because in his first episode (in 2003) he encountered Tommie with the word &quot;baasje&quot;. Since then everyone calls him like that, although his real name is Drommels. He is played by Martin van Waardenberg.
* Elvan (Elvan Akyıldız) was introduced in 1997, taking over the role of a teenage character from Lot.
* Frank (Frank Groothof) joined in 1983, in the role of a naughty young guy. Later he became more a kind of funny uncle towards the children.
* Gerda, (Gerda Havertong), joined in 1984, as a nice aunt. Since 1997 Gerda became a less seen character, while the actress Gerda Havertong took up the role of Gerda&#x27;s sister Peetje, a funny Surinamese lady who is always using naughty tricks on everyone.
* Hakim (Hakim Traïda) joined in 1984. He is an often silent mime character, often in his own inserts. In his first episodes he never talked, but later he was more seen in stories in the street and spoke more.
* Lot (Lot Lohr) joined in 1988, taking over the role of a teenage character (often referred as &quot;Lotje&quot; by meneer Aart). Since 1995 she is more in the role of a working mother, often seen behind a laptop.
* Lex (Lex Goudsmit), a grandpa figure from 1984 until his death in 1999. 
* Meneer Aart (Aart Staartjes) debuted in 1984. His role was that of a mildly cranky old man who would grumble at the childish antics of the muppet cast, and who would sometimes complain about how the old days used to be better. He was introduced as a foil after one of the scenario writers remarked that the show was too saccharine (referring to Sesamstraat as &quot;a paradise without a snake&quot;), nonetheless he became a well-loved character among the people who grew up with him. Meneer Aart demanded to be called &quot;Meneer Aart&quot; (Mr. Aart) and he saw himself as the most important man of the street. Since the death of Lex, Aart has sometimes taken up the role of a grandpa. Just like the other characters he doesn&#x27;t like Buurman Baasje. He always calls Pino &quot;Piño&quot;. Aart Staartjes&#x27; performance of Mr. Aart was loved by many and he continued to perform this character for over 40 years until his death on 12 January 2020.
* Paula (Paula Sleijp) joined in 1982. Her role is some kind of grandma, but since 1996 in a more stern way. In the 1990s Paula Sleijp also played the character of the Baroness, a silly and dumb lady with a French accent. After 28 years, she left the show in 2010.
* Rik (Rik Hoogendoorn) debuted in 1993 as Mr. Aart&#x27;s nephew (although he never calls Aart his uncle). Rik is a clumsy young man, trying to do silly inventions, which often do not work. He is also a thick man, who enjoys eating and hates sports. He left the cast in 2007.
* Sien (Sien Diels) was already in the first episode in 1976. She runs a store. In the first seasons she was often wearing overalls and using tools, because of the focus on female emancipation.

<text>The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) is the governing body of the men&#x27;s professional tennis circuits – the ATP Tour and the ATP Challenger Tour. It was formed in September 1972 by Donald Dell, Jack Kramer, and Cliff Drysdale to protect the interests of professional tennis players, and Drysdale became the first president. Since 1990 the association has organized the ATP Tour, the worldwide tennis tour for men and linked the title of the tour with the organization&#x27;s name. It is the governing body of men&#x27;s professional tennis. In 1990 the organization was called the ATP Tour, which was renamed in 2001 as just ATP and the tour being called ATP Tour. In 2009 the name of the tour was changed again and was known as the ATP World Tour, but changed again to the ATP Tour by 2019. It is an evolution of the tour competitions previously known as Grand Prix tennis tournaments and World Championship Tennis (WCT). The ATP&#x27;s global headquarters are in London. ATP Americas is based in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida; ATP Europe is headquartered in Monaco; and ATP International, which covers Africa, Asia and Australasia, is based in Sydney, Australia.

==Early history==

Launched in 1972 by Jack Kramer, Donald Dell, and Cliff Drysdale, it was first managed by Jack Kramer, as executive director, and Cliff Drysdale, as president. Jim McManus was a founding member. Kramer created the professional players&#x27; rankings system, which started the following year and is still in use. From 1974 to 1989, the men&#x27;s circuit was administered by a sub-committee called the &quot;Men&#x27;s International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC)&quot;. It was made up of representatives of the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the ATP, and tournament directors from around the world. The ATP successfully requested that the MIPTC introduce a drug testing rule, making tennis the first professional sport to institute a drug-testing program.

===1973 Wimbledon boycott===
In May 1973 Nikola Pilić, Yugoslavia&#x27;s number one tennis player, was suspended by his national lawn tennis association, who claimed he had refused to play in a Davis Cup tie for his country earlier that month. The initial suspension of nine months, supported by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), was later reduced by the ILTF to one month which meant that Pilic would not be allowed to play at Wimbledon.

In response, the ATP threatened a boycott, stating that if Pilić was not allowed to compete, none should. After last-ditch attempts at a compromise failed, the ATP voted in favor of a boycott and as a result, 81 of the top players, including reigning champion Stan Smith and 13 of the 16 men&#x27;s seeds, did not compete at the 1973 Wimbledon Championships. Three ATP players, Ilie Năstase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie, defied the boycott and were fined by the ATP&#x27;s disciplinary committee.

===1988 breakaway===
But the tour was still run by the tournament directors and the ITF. The limited player representation and influence within the Men&#x27;s International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC) as well as dissatisfaction with the way the sport was managed and marketed culminated in a player mutiny in 1988 led by active tennis pros, including then world number one ranked Mats Wilander which changed the entire structure of the tour.

CEO Hamilton Jordan is credited with the &quot;Parking Lot Press Conference&quot; on 26 August 1988 during which the ATP announced their withdrawal from the MIPTC (then called the MTC) and the creation of their ATP Tour from 1990 onwards. This re-organisation also ended a lawsuit with Volvo and Donald Dell. On 19 January 1989 the ATP published the calendar for the inaugural 1990 season.

By 1991, the men had their first television package to broadcast 19 tournaments. Coming online with their first website in 1995, this was followed by a multi-year agreement with Mercedes-Benz. Lawsuits in 2008, around virtually the same issues, resulted in a restructured tour.

===2022 reaction to Russian invasion===

In reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) moved the 2022 St. Petersburg Open from Saint Petersburg to Kazakhstan. In May 2022, the ATP stripped the Wimbledon tournament of its world ranking points over the tournament&#x27;s decision to decline entries from Russian and Belarusian players. The UK Culture Secretary, Nadine Dorries, commented that the ATP&#x27;s decision would send the &quot;completely wrong message to both Putin and the people of Ukraine&quot;.

==Tournaments==

The ATP Tour comprises ATP Masters 1000, ATP 500, and ATP 250. The ATP also oversees the ATP Challenger Tour, a level below the ATP Tour, and the ATP Champions Tour for seniors. Grand Slam tournaments, a small portion of the Olympic tennis tournament, the Davis Cup, the Hopman Cup and the introductory level Futures tournaments do not fall under the auspices of the ATP, but are overseen by the ITF instead and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the Olympics. In these events, however, ATP ranking points are still awarded, with the exception of the Olympics and Hopman Cup. The four-week ITF Satellite tournaments were discontinued in 2007.

Players and doubles teams with the most ranking points (collected during the calendar year) play in the season-ending ATP Finals, which, from 2000 to 2008, was run jointly with the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The details of the professional tennis tour are:
===2009 changes===

In 2009, ATP introduced a new tour structure called ATP World Tour consisting of ATP World Tour Masters 1000, ATP World Tour 500, and ATP World Tour 250 tier tournaments. Broadly speaking, the Tennis Masters Series tournaments became the new Masters 1000 level and ATP International Series Gold and ATP International Series events became ATP 500 level and 250 level events respectively.

The Masters 1000 tournaments are Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo, Madrid, Rome, Toronto/Montreal, Cincinnati, Shanghai and Paris. The end-of-year event, the ATP Finals, moved from Shanghai to London. Hamburg has been displaced by the new clay court event at Madrid, which is a new combined men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tournament. In 2011, Rome and Cincinnati also became combined tournaments. Severe sanctions are placed on top players skipping the Masters 1000 series events, unless medical proof is presented.

Plans to eliminate Monte Carlo and Hamburg as Masters Series events led to controversy and protests from players as well as organisers. Hamburg and Monte Carlo filed lawsuits against the ATP, and as a concession it was decided that Monte Carlo would remain a Masters 1000 level event, with more prize money and 1000 ranking points, but it would no longer be a compulsory tournament for top-ranked players. Monte Carlo later dropped its suit. Hamburg was &quot;reserved&quot; to become a 500 level event in the summer. Hamburg did not accept this concession, but later lost its suit.

The 500 level tournaments are Rotterdam, Dubai, Rio, Acapulco, Barcelona, Aegon Championships (Queens Club, London), Halle (Gerry Weber Open), Hamburg, Washington, Beijing, Tokyo, Basel and Vienna.

The ATP &amp; ITF have declared that Davis Cup World Group and World Group Playoffs award a total of up to 500 points. Players accumulate points over the four rounds and the playoffs and these are counted as one of a player&#x27;s four best results from the 500 level events. An additional 125 points are given to a player who wins all 8 live rubbers and wins the Davis Cup.

==ATP rankings==
ATP publishes weekly rankings of professional players: ATP rankings (commonly known as the ‘world rankings’), a 52-week rolling ranking, and the ATP Race to Turin, a year to date ranking. All ATP players also have a Universal Tennis Rating, based on head-to-head results.

The ATP rankings is used for determining qualification for entry and seeding in all tournaments for both singles and doubles. Within the ATP rankings period which is the past year, points are accumulated with the exception of those for the ATP Finals, whose points are dropped following the last ATP event of the year. The player with the most points by the season&#x27;s end is the world No. 1 of the year.

The ATP rankings Race to Turin is a calendar-year indicator of what the PIF ATP Rankings will be on the Monday after the end of the regular season. Players finishing in the top eight of the Emirates ATP Rankings following the Paris Masters will qualify for the ATP Finals.

At the beginning of the 2009 season, all accumulated ranking points were doubled to bring them in line with the new tournament ranking system.

<text>In the early years of the 1970s comedy TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, John Belushi portrayed an archetypal samurai — he has a strong sense of honor, speaks only (mock) Japanese, and wields a katana. Sketches featuring the character showed him in different occupations that would not be expected for a samurai. He always performed his tasks perfectly, despite scaring his clients quite a few times. The character was modeled after Toshiro Mifune&#x27;s character in Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Yojimbo&quot;.

Samurai Futaba would probably not have become a recurring character if not for Buck Henry&#x27;s insistence that there be a second sketch featuring him when he first hosted on January 17, 1976. It is perhaps due to these origins that it became standard practice on SNL to feature a Samurai sketch every time Henry hosted, until Belushi left the cast. Except for &quot;Samurai BMOC&quot;, each time Henry would play the same character, Mr. Dantley.

In issue #74 of &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; (cover dated October, 1978), Belushi (in character as Samurai Futaba) teams up with Spider-Man to duel the Marvel Comics supervillain Silver Samurai. In the story, the Silver Samurai seeks to recover a ring containing a teleportation device that had inadvertently come into Belushi&#x27;s possession. An alternate version of the &quot;Samurai Deli&quot; sketch also appears briefly in issue #54 of &quot;The Sandman&quot;, part of a timeline where Prez Rickard becomes President of the United States and hosts the &quot;highest-rated&quot; episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in history.

== List of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episodes featuring Samurai Futaba ==
* &quot;Samurai Hotel&quot; December 13, 1975 – Belushi and his bellhop (host Richard Pryor, also portraying a samurai, the only time any other samurai was depicted) duel over who has to carry a guest&#x27;s bags. Pryor smashes the front desk with his sword; The Samurai says, &quot;Well, I can dig where you&#x27;re coming from,&quot; the only words ever spoken by the character in English.
* &quot;Samurai Delicatessen&quot; January 17, 1976 – Mr. Dantley (host Buck Henry) waits as the Samurai makes a sandwich by severing ropes on hanging salami, slicing tomatoes in midair, and splitting bread with his skull. The two of them carry on a pleasant conversation although each speaks a different language.
* &quot;Samurai Divorce Court&quot; February 14, 1976 – &quot;Futaba vs. Futaba&quot;. In the Samurai world, custody cases are resolved by splitting children in half. Show regular Jane Curtin plays Futaba&#x27;s wife. Host: Peter Boyle
* &quot;Samurai Tailor&quot; May 22, 1976 – Mr. Dantley (Buck Henry) needs a tuxedo for a wedding. The Samurai makes one for him with his katana.
* &quot;Samurai General Practitioner&quot; July 31, 1976 host: Kris Kristofferson
* &quot;Samurai Stockbroker&quot; October 30, 1976 – Belushi accidentally strikes Buck Henry, playing the client Mr. Dantley, in the forehead with a katana. On tape, Henry clearly staggers back from the blow. Afterward, Henry appeared on camera with a band-aid covering the cut on his forehead. In solidarity, for the remainder of the broadcast the rest of the cast members (including a teddy bear in one later sketch) also appeared with band-aids on their foreheads.
* &quot;The Purple Lagoon&quot; (during musical performance) December 11, 1976 musical guest: Frank Zappa
* &quot;Samurai Hit Man&quot; March 19, 1977 – Don Marsala (Dan Aykroyd) hires the Samurai to kill, as soon as possible, both Don Cornelius and Don Kirshner.
* &quot;Samurai B.M.O.C.&quot; May 21, 1977 – The Samurai must convince Dean Bynum (Buck Henry) that he is qualified to graduate from college.
* &quot;Samurai Dry Cleaners&quot; October 29, 1977 host: Charles Grodin
* &quot;Samurai Psychiatrist&quot; November 19, 1977 – Buck Henry relates a disturbing dream.
* &quot;Samurai Night Fever&quot; February 25, 1978 – a parody of the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, with the Samurai as a disco dancer. Host O.J. Simpson plays the Samurai&#x27;s brother.
* &quot;Samurai TV Repairman&quot; May 20, 1978 – The Samurai tosses a TV set around, hits it with his sword, plunges two knives into the top grille, and the picture turns out perfect. Host: Buck Henry
* &quot;Rollo&quot; (during musical performance) October 21, 1978 – host: Frank Zappa
* &quot;Samurai Optometrist&quot; November 11, 1978 – The Samurai nearly commits seppuku when Buck Henry calls him an &quot;optician&quot;.
* &quot;Samurai Bakery&quot; May 26, 1979 – host: Buck Henry Mr. Dantley (Buck Henry) buys a last-minute wedding cake, only it is not boxed. The Samurai tosses the cake in the air, and slices it to pieces as it drops behind the counter, only to pick up neatly packaged, string-tied pink boxes, which he hands to Mr. Dantley.

<text>Andrew Ainslie Common FRS (1841–1903) was an English amateur astronomer best known for his pioneering work in astrophotography.

==Biography==
Common was born in Newcastle Upon Tyne on 7 August 1841. His father, Thomas Common, a surgeon known for his treatment of cataract, died when Andrew was a child, forcing him to go early into the world of work. In the 1860s he teamed up with an uncle in the sanitary engineering firm of Matthew Hall and Company. He married in 1867. In 1890 he retired from Matthew Hall. Andrew Ainslie Common died of heart failure 2 June 1903.

==Work in astronomy==
Although Common&#x27;s professional career was in the field of sanitary engineering, he is most noted for the work he did as an amateur in the field of astronomy. As a child Andrew showed interest in astronomy. At age 10 his mother borrowed a telescope for him to use from a local doctor, Dr. Bates of Morpeth. He returned to astronomy in his 30s when he took up experimenting with gelatin plate photography of the moon and planets with a refracting telescope.
In 1876 Common became a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society. About this time he also moved to Ealing outside London where he would live for the rest of his life operating an astronomical observatory from the back garden of his house. Common realised he would need very large telescopes to gather enough light to record the images of stars photographically so he began building a series of ever larger Newtonian reflecting telescopes using the then new technology of silver coated glass mirrors. For the first of these, a telescope of his own design constructed in 1876, he tried to grind and polish his own 17 inch mirror but gave up on the idea and ordered an mirror from George Calver of Chelmsford. In 1877 and 1878 he published several articles on his visual observations of the satellites of Mars and Saturn. In 1896 Common joined the British Astronomical Association.

;The 36-inch reflector
In 1879 he bought a new mirror from Calver to mount in a larger Newtonian reflecting telescope he was building. He used it to make further observations of satellites of Mars and Saturn, and was able to see Saturn&#x27;s moon Mimas and show that the ephemeris of its orbit was incorrect. With this instrument he also obtained a photograph of a comet in 1881, C/1881 K1. His most notable work with this telescope were the long time exposures he made of the Orion Nebula between 1880 and 1884. His 1883 photograph of that nebula for the first time showed photography&#x27;s ability to record stars and other features invisible to the human eye. Common noted of his own photographs that:
:&quot;although some details are lost in the enlargement, sufficient remains to show that we are approaching the time where a photograph will give us the means to recording in its own inimitable way the shape of a nebula and the relative brightness different parts, in a better manner than the most careful hand drawing&quot;.
These pictures earned Common the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1884. Common eventually sold the 36-inch reflector to British politician Edward Crossley who gave it to Lick Observatory in 1895, becoming the Crossley telescope at that observatory.

;The 60-inch reflector
In 1885 Common embarked on building a Newtonian reflecting telescope. He chose to buy the raw glass blank and do the grinding and polishing himself. The first mirror he made performed poorly, showing an elliptical deformation of the stars, causing him to fabricate a second mirror in 1890. After a near fall from the high staging needed to reach the Newtonian focus of the telescope Common decided to convert the telescope to a Cassegrain configuration for safer use. To avoid having to bore a hole in the 60 inch primary mirror he mounted a diagonal flat mirror just in front of it to bring the image out to a focus at the lower side of the telescope. He was not satisfied with how this configuration worked and that, combined with his attention being diverted to other projects and the ever more light polluted skies west of London, meant the telescope fell into disuse. After Common&#x27;s death the telescope with its two 60 inch mirrors and other secondary optics was purchased from his estate and installed at the Harvard College Observatory. In the 1933 the primary mirror was re-figured and a new mount built. It was then set up as the 1.5-meter Boyden-UFS reflector (also called the &quot;60-inch Rockefeller&quot;) at Boyden Observatory in South Africa.

==Other projects==
Dr. Common was largely retired by 1890 and devoted himself full-time to optical design and construction until his death. Most of his time was spent in the design of telescopic and optical sights for the Royal Navy and the Royal Artillery, in which work he was a pioneer. Captain (later Admiral Sir) Percy Scott, one of the leading gunnery officers of the Royal Navy, stated in 1902 that Dr. Common had &quot;...produced (that is &quot;designed&quot;) a telescope sight which would, when properly used, quadruple the fighting efficiency of our battleships&quot;.

In response to problems of rifle aiming and accuracy revealed in the 2nd Anglo-Boer War, he designed an experimental short telescopic sight for the Lee–Enfield rifle, on a removable offset mounting graduated up to 2000 yards range, which anticipated several features used on many later military rifle &#x27;scopes.

He also pioneered techniques in producing large optical flat mirrors.

<text>The Graphical, Paper and Media Union (GPMU) was a trade union in the United Kingdom and Ireland between 1991 and 2005.

==History==
The GPMU was formed from the merger of SOGAT and the National Graphical Association (NGA) and claimed to be the world&#x27;s largest media union, having over 200,000 members working in the print, publishing, paper, IT and media industries.

The general secretaries of both predecessor unions stood in the GPMU leadership election, with an agreement that the loser would become Deputy General Secretary. Tony Dubbins of the NGA narrowly defeated Brenda Dean of SOGAT, by 78,654 votes to 72,657. Dubbins served as general secretary throughout the GPMU&#x27;s existence, but Dean stood down after one year ; in 1994, Tony Burke became Deputy General Secretary. The first General President was Bryn Griffith, former General President of the NGA, who defeated Danny Sergeant of SOGAT. Griffith was succeeded by Doug Douglas, following a controversial High Court case, when the union tried to ignore the ballot result in 1995.

Facing a decline in membership, in February 2004, GPMU opened merger negotiations with the skilled engineering, manufacturing and white collar union Amicus. In August 2004, results of a ballot of all members were released, showing 86% of members in favour of merger. The formal merger took place in early 2005, (at the same time the finance union UNIFI joined Amicus) and GPMU became the semi-autonomous Graphical, Paper and Media sector of Amicus. Tony Dubbins became the Deputy General Secretary of Amicus and Tony Burke became Assistant General Secretary of Amicus. Tony Dubbins was also the union&#x27;s political head and Chair of TULO. He retired to Spain in October, 2008.

Amicus merged with the Transport &amp; General Workers Union in May 2007 to form Unite the Union. The GPM sector of Amicus become the Graphical, Paper &amp; Media sector of Unite the Union.

Tony Burke became the Assistant General Secretary of Unite responsible for the union&#x27;s manufacturing section.

In 2014 faced with major changes to the print, communications and the media industries, the Unite sectors GPM merged with Information, Technology and Communications sector to form the GPM ITC sector, currently known as the GPM &amp; IT sector.

A permanent display of memorabilia and the history of the print and papermaking unions of the UK and Ireland is housed at the Marx Memorial Library in Clerkenwell, London.

==Election results==
The union sponsored several Parliamentary candidates, many of whom won election. All such sponsorship arrangements ended in 1995, when the Labour Party changed its rules.

<text>John Richard Thomas Sullivan OBE (23 December 1946 – 22 April 2011) was an English television scriptwriter responsible for several British sitcoms, including &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; and &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;.

From working-class South London, Sullivan worked in a variety of low-paid jobs for 15 years before getting his first break writing sketches for &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, which led to writing the sitcom &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; (1977–1980). He became best known for his next sitcom, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; (1981–2003). Other sitcoms include &quot;Dear John&quot;, &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot;, &quot;Roger Roger&quot;, and &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;. In addition, he wrote the comedy drama serial &quot;Over Here&quot; and the drama series &quot;Micawber&quot; for ITV, and co-wrote the comedy &quot;Heartburn Hotel&quot;.

Sullivan&#x27;s work won him a number of comedy awards, including the BAFTA for best sitcom on three occasions, and he was made an OBE in 2005. His last work was &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;, a comedy drama prequel to &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. The final episode of Sullivan&#x27;s last comedy series aired six days after his death from pneumonia on 22 April 2011.

==Early life and education==
Sullivan was born at 35 Zennor Road in Balham, South London, on 23 December 1946. His father was John Patrick Sullivan (17 March 1908 – September 1993) and his mother was Hilda Clara May, née Parker (23 December 1907 – December 1992). Sullivan was from a working-class background, and grew up in Balham. His father was an Irish-born plumber, and his mother occasionally worked as a charwoman. It was in Balham where he observed the sort of market trader that would later appear in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;.

Sullivan failed his eleven-plus and attended Telferscot Secondary Modern School, where he had an inspirational English teacher named Jim Trowers, who sparked an interest in reading the novels of Charles Dickens and discovered his talent for writing stories. Sullivan left the school at Christmas 1961 with no qualifications. He did, however, attend evening classes in German and English, and read Teach Yourself books after leaving school.

==Career==
Sullivan&#x27;s first paid employment was as a messenger boy for Reuters. He then worked in the second-hand car trade, in a brewery, as a window cleaner, and as a carpet layer in the House of Commons.

===BBC===
Sullivan got his break into television after submitting scripts to the BBC. He admired &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;, Phil Silvers&#x27; US show &quot;Bilko&quot;, and &quot;anything by Neil Simon&quot;. In November 1974, he gained a job in the BBC props department. He was warned not to pester or approach the stars of the corporation. However, Ronnie Barker encouraged him to write for &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;, and he also wrote for Dave Allen. He eventually approached television producer Dennis Main Wilson with a script about a young Marxist. This led to a pilot for &quot;Comedy Special&quot; in 1977 which, following a positive reaction, was commissioned for a full series, &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; (1977–80). &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; ran for four series, after which Sullivan was asked to submit another idea. An initial idea for a comedy set in the world of football was rejected, so he proposed an alternative idea for a sitcom centring on a cockney market trader in working-class, modern-day London called &quot;Readies&quot;.

Through Ray Butt, a BBC producer and director whom Sullivan had met and befriended when they were working on &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;, a draft script was shown to the corporation&#x27;s Head of Comedy, John Howard Davies. Davies commissioned Sullivan to write a full series under an alternative title &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, which had also been the name of a &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; episode. Sullivan believed the key factor in it being accepted was the success of ITV&#x27;s new drama &quot;Minder&quot;, a series with a similar premise and also set in 1980s London.

Much of Sullivan&#x27;s material for &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; scripts came from his real-life experiences; falling through a raised bar flap, the chandelier falling, his father&#x27;s poker sessions, his niece working in the police force, and his grandfather falling down holes to claim money. It is possible that the poverty of the Trotter family, and their eventual rise to wealth, is based on Sullivan&#x27;s own background. He grew up in a poor household and noted in an interview that he and his friends seemingly had no opportunities after leaving school apart from becoming, as Sullivan put it, &quot;factory fodder&quot;. The success of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; made him very rich.

With the success of &quot;Only Fools...&quot;, at the suggestion of his wife he decided to write a romantic comedy series featuring a strong female lead character. His source of inspiration was a letter in a magazine read to him by his wife, written by a woman who had been jilted by her fiancé on the day of her wedding. &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; ran for three series and a feature-length special between 1983 and 1986. Other sitcoms included &quot;Dear John&quot; (1986–1987) and &quot;Sitting Pretty&quot; (1992–1993). Later in his career, he moved towards writing comedy drama series such as &quot;Over Here&quot; (1996), &quot;Roger Roger&quot; (1996–2003), and &quot;Micawber&quot; (2001). His last work, &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot; (2010–2011), was the second spin-off of &quot;Only Fools...&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; won the BAFTA award for best comedy series in 1986, 1989 and 1997, as well as the RTS best comedy award in 1997, best sitcom at the 1990 British Comedy Awards, and two Television and Radio Industries Club Awards for comedy programme of the year in 1984 and 1997. Sullivan won the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain comedy award for the 1996 &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; (OFAH) Christmas trilogy and another from The Heritage Foundation in 2001.

In the 2005 New Year Honours, Sullivan was appointed an OBE for services to drama. On 2 September 2008, he was awarded an Honorary Fellowship at Goldsmiths, University of London.

On 22 July 2012, a blue plaque was unveiled by David Jason at Teddington Studios in Middlesex, England, to celebrate Sullivan&#x27;s contribution to British comedy. Nicholas Lyndhurst and John Challis also attended among other cast members.

==Death==

Sullivan died on 22 April 2011, in a Surrey hospital, after having viral pneumonia for six weeks. He was 64. BBC Director-General Mark Thompson paid tribute, saying: &quot;John had a unique gift for turning everyday life and characters we all know into unforgettable comedy.&quot; Six days after his death, the third episode of &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot; aired on BBC One. Due to Sullivan&#x27;s death, this was to be the final episode.

Gareth Gwenlan, a producer of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and a close friend of Sullivan, paid tribute to the writer: &quot;The sudden death of John Sullivan has deprived the world of television comedy of its greatest exponent. John was a writer of immense talent and he leaves behind him an extraordinary body of work which has entertained tens of millions of viewers and will continue to do so for many decades to come.&quot; Sullivan was survived by his wife Sharon, whom he married on 23 February 1974, two sons Dan and Jim, a daughter, Amy, and three grandchildren.

==Writing credits==
Sullivan wrote (and in two cases sang) the theme tunes for &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;, &quot;Dear John&quot; and &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;.

<doc id="627130" wikidata="Q43790226" url="?curid=627130" title="Emergency Exit">
<text>Emergency Exit (1978) is a two-act play by written originally in Italian as &quot;Uscita d&#x27;emergenza&quot;. It was Santanelli&#x27;s first production in 1980 and made him famous as a playwright.

== Synopsis ==
Two squatters share an abandoned house in Naples. They are both unemployed, previously Cirillo had been a theatre prompter and Pacebbene was a sacristan. The house is in an area deserted after an earthquake and about to collapse.

== Productions ==
&quot;Emergency Exit&quot; was first produced at the Teatro San Ferdinando in 1980, featuring Nello Mascia and Bruno Cirino. The play was performed in November 2013 at the Piccolo Bellini theatre in Naples, with 
Rino Di Martino and Ernesto Mahieux playing the two roles.

== Response ==
Eugène Ionesco commented that &quot;Santanelli&#x27;s work is some of the finest I&#x27;ve seen in years. It is, indeed, extraordinary, intended for audiences who hunger for the rare and the beautiful.&quot; &quot;The International Daily&quot; stated that &quot;in terms of Italian dramaturgy, &quot;Emergency Exit&quot; could be as much of an influence as Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Caretaker&quot; was in Britain&quot; and &quot;La Repubblica&quot; viewed it as &quot;a meeting of two exacting theatrical traditions: the grand Neapolitan revival of the commedia dell&#x27;arte... and modern-day Europe&#x27;s cutting-edge, existentialist theater of the grotesque&quot;.

The play won awards from the Istituto del Dramma Italiano (IDI) and Associazione Nazionale dei Critici Italiani (ANCI) in Italy.

<text>Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company, Inc., better known by the shortened name Ruger, is an American firearm manufacturing company based in Southport, Connecticut, with production facilities also in Newport, New Hampshire; Mayodan, North Carolina; and Prescott, Arizona. The company was founded in 1949 by Alexander McCormick Sturm and William B. Ruger and has been publicly traded since 1969.

Ruger produces bolt-action, semi-automatic, and single-shot rifles, semi-automatic pistols, and single- and double-action revolvers. According to the ATF statistics for 2022, Ruger is the largest firearm manufacturer in the United States, surpassing Smith &amp; Wesson. 
==History==

Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company was founded by William B. Ruger and Alexander McCormick Sturm in 1949 in a small rented machine shop in Southport, Connecticut.

Just prior to their partnership, Bill Ruger had successfully duplicated two Japanese &quot;baby&quot; Nambu pistols in his garage, from a captured Nambu that he acquired from a returning Marine, at the close of World War II. When it came to designing the Company&#x27;s first product, Bill Ruger designed a semi-auto pistol that incorporated the looks of the German 9mm Luger P08 and the American Colt Woodsman into their first commercially produced .22 caliber pistol (see Ruger Standard), which became so successful that it launched the entire company.
Ruger is a dominant manufacturer in the .22 LR rimfire rifle market in the U.S., due primarily to the sales of its Ruger 10/22 semiautomatic rifle. The 10/22 is very popular due to its reputation for being relatively inexpensive and of high quality. As a result, a wealth of after-market accessories and parts were made available for it, which has further increased its popularity.

Ruger similarly dominates the .22 rimfire semi-automatic pistol market with the Ruger Mark IV, a descendant of the Ruger Standard pistol. Like the 10/22, the Mark Series is supported with a wide variety of after-market accessories. The 22/45 is similar to the Ruger Standard family of pistols but features a different grip angle, that of the Colt 1911 (as opposed to that of a Luger utilized in the Ruger Standard).

Ruger is also renowned for the production of high-quality revolvers, such as the GP100 and Redhawk lines. They also have some presence in the semi-auto pistol market, with the SR1911 and SR22 lines of handguns.

From 1949 through 2004, Ruger manufactured over 20 million firearms. The company is headquartered in Southport, Connecticut, and maintains manufacturing facilities in Newport, New Hampshire, Prescott, Arizona, and Mayodan, North Carolina. Ruger&#x27;s subsidiaries are Ruger Precision Metals LLC in Earth City, Missouri, Pine Tree Castings in Newport, New Hampshire, and Ruger Sportswear &amp; Accessories in Mayodan, North Carolina. Ruger&#x27;s Pine Tree Castings division makes ferrous, ductile iron, and commercial titanium castings. Ruger had a division known as Ruger Golf, making steel and titanium castings for golf clubs made by a number of different brands in the 1990s.

Sturm, Ruger stock has been publicly traded since 1969 and became a New York Stock Exchange company in 1990 (NYSE:RGR). After Alex Sturm&#x27;s death in 1951, William B. Ruger continued to direct the company until his death in 2002.

In September 2020, the company bought the Marlin Firearms company from bankrupt Remington Outdoor Company. Just one year after the acquisition of Marlin, Ruger introduced the first Ruger-made Marlin lever-action rifle, the Model 1895 SBL. 

In 2024, Ruger is celebrating their 75th anniversary.

==Statistics==
Ruger was ranked the number one U.S. firearms manufacturer from 2008 to 2011. In 2011, Ruger manufactured 1,114,687 firearms, as their promotion, the &quot;Million Gun Challenge to Benefit the NRA&quot;, played a significant role in the company maintaining its top U.S. manufacturer status. The company has set a new goal of 2 million firearms produced per year. From 2009 to 2012, Ruger was the top-seller of handguns.

<doc id="627132" wikidata="Q1235510" url="?curid=627132" title="Dolgellau">
<text>Dolgellau (; ) is a town and community in Gwynedd, north-west Wales, lying on the River Wnion, a tributary of the River Mawddach. It was the traditional county town of the historic county of Merionethshire until the county of Gwynedd was created in 1974. Dolgellau is the main base for climbers of Cadair Idris and Mynydd Moel which are visible from the town. Dolgellau is the second largest settlement in southern Gwynedd after Tywyn and includes the community of Penmaenpool.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Dolgellau&quot; is a compound of &#x27;water-meadow&#x27; and , the plural of &#x27;a cell&#x27;, giving the meaning &#x27;water-meadow of cells&#x27;. The in the name was probably located within a bend at the confluence of the rivers Wnion and Aran. The may refer to monastic cells or merchant&#x27;s stalls.

The earliest recorded spelling (from 1254) is &quot;Dolkelew&quot;, and a spelling &quot;Dolgethleu&quot; dates from 1294–5 (the &quot;thl&quot; is an attempt to represent Welsh ). Owain Glyndŵr&#x27;s scribe wrote &quot;Dolguelli&quot;.

The town&#x27;s name was commonly anglicised as &quot;Dolgelly&quot; or &quot;Dolgelley&quot;. Up until the 19th century most spellings in English were along the lines of &quot;Dôlgelly&quot;, &quot;Dolgelley&quot;, &quot;Dolgelly&quot; or &quot;Dolgelli&quot;. Thomas Pennant used the form &quot;Dolgelleu&quot; in his &quot;Tours of Wales&quot;, and this was the form used in the Church Registers in 1723, although it never had much currency.

In 1825 the Registers have &quot;Dolgellau&quot;, which was the form adopted by Robert Vaughan of Hengwrt in 1836. This became standard in Welsh and later also in English.

The official name for the urban district which covered the town and the surrounding rural district was changed from &quot;Dolgelley&quot; to &quot;Dolgellau&quot; in 1958 by Merioneth County Council, following requests from both district councils.

==History and economy==

The site of Dolgellau was, in the pre-Roman Celtic period, part of the tribal lands of the Ordovices, who were conquered by the Romans in AD 77–78. Although a few Roman coins from the reigns of Emperors Hadrian and Trajan have been found near Dolgellau, the area is marshy and there is no evidence that it was settled during the Roman period. There are, however, three hill forts in the vicinity of Dolgellau, of uncertain origin.

After the Romans left, the area came under the control of a series of Welsh chieftains, although Dolgellau was probably not inhabited until the late 11th or 12th century, when it was established as a &quot;serf village&quot; (or &quot;&quot;), possibly by Cadwgan ap Bleddyn. It remained a serf village until the reign of Henry VII (1485–1509).

A church was built in the 12th century (demolished and replaced by the present building in 1716), although Cymer Abbey, founded in 1198 in nearby Llanelltyd, remained the most important religious centre locally. Dolgellau gained in importance from this period onwards, and was mentioned in the Survey of Merioneth ordered by Edward I (Llanelltyd was not). In 1404 it was the location of a council of chiefs under Owain Glyndŵr.

After a visit by George Fox in 1657, many inhabitants of Dolgellau converted to Quakerism. Persecution led a large number of them to emigrate to Pennsylvania in 1686, under the leadership of Rowland Ellis, a local gentleman-farmer. The Pennsylvanian town of Bryn Mawr, home to a prestigious women&#x27;s liberal arts college, is named after Ellis&#x27;s farm near Dolgellau.

The woollen industry was long of the greatest importance to the town&#x27;s economy; by the end of the 18th century, output was reckoned to be worth £50,000 to £100,000 annually. The industry declined in the first half of the 19th century, owing to the introduction of mechanical looms. Another important contributor to the local economy was tanning, which continued into the 1980s in Dolgellau, though on a much reduced scale.

The town was the centre of a minor gold rush in the 19th century. At one time the local gold mines employed over 500 workers. Clogau St. David&#x27;s mine in Bontddu and Gwynfynydd mine in Ganllwyd have supplied gold for many royal weddings.

Dolgellau was the county town of Merionethshire () until 1974 when, following the Local Government Act of 1972, it became the administrative centre of Meirionnydd, a district of the county of Gwynedd. This was abolished in 1996 by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994.

Today, the economy of Dolgellau relies chiefly on tourism (see below), although agriculture still plays a role; a farmers&#x27; market is held in the town centre on the third Sunday of every month.

It is believed that Dolgellau Cricket Club, founded in 1869 by Frederick Temple, is one of the oldest cricket clubs in Wales.

For nearly a century Dolgellau was the home of Dr Williams School, a pioneering girls&#x27; secondary school. This was funded from the legacy of Daniel Williams the Welsh nonconformist of the 17th/18th century.

Shortly before the closure of the town&#x27;s railway station it displayed signs reading variously Dolgelly, Dolgelley and Dolgellau.

== Education ==
Dolgellau is home to a bilingual further education college, Coleg Meirion-Dwyfor. The site it occupies was originally home to Dr Williams&#x27; School, a direct grant grammar school for girls aged 7–18 established in 1875 (opened 1878). It was named after its benefactor Daniel Williams, (1643–1716) a Nonconformist minister from Wrexham, who also gave his name to Dr Williams&#x27;s Library in Euston, London. The school closed in 1975.

Dolgellau Grammar School, a boys&#x27; school, had been established in 1665 by the then Rector of Dolgellau, John Ellis, at Pen Bryn (now demolished), before moving to its present site on the Welshpool road. In 1962, it became a comprehensive school under the name Ysgol y Gader (&quot;School of the Chair&quot;, in reference to the mountain Cadair Idris, whose name translates as &quot;Idris&#x27;s Chair&quot;).

On 1 September 2017, Ysgol Y Gader amalgamated with the village&#x27;s primary school and seven other schools in the area to become a new middle school for pupils aged 3–16. The combined schools were named Ysgol Bro Idris. As of 2019, there were 581 pupils on roll. 229 of those pupils are of secondary school age and 352 of those pupils are of primary school age. The area school is located across six sites, with two of those sites located within Dolgellau itself.

The school is categorised linguistically by Welsh Government as a category 2A school, meaning that at least 80% of subjects, apart from English and Welsh, are taught only through the medium of Welsh to all pupils.

==Literary connections==
Near Dolgellau is the house of Hengwrt, whose 17th-century owner Robert Vaughan (?1592–1667) kept an extensive library. This was home to numerous manuscript treasures, including the Book of Aneirin, the Book of Taliesin, the Black Book of Carmarthen, the White Book of Rhydderch and the Hengwrt manuscript. The Hengwrt manuscripts (not including the Book of Aneirin, taken from Hengwrt in the 1780s) form the majority of the collection now known as the Peniarth Manuscripts, held at the National Library of Wales.

In 1971 John Elwyn Jones, a retired teacher who had taught Russian, German and Welsh at Dr Williams School, published &#x27; (&quot;Five Tries for a Welshman&quot;), an account of his time as a prisoner of war in Poland during the Second World War. The title of the book refers to the five attempts he made to escape, the last of which succeeded. The book was dramatised by S4C in 1997. In 1986 and 1987 John Elwyn published his autobiography in 3 volumes, called &#x27; (&quot;In My Own Way&quot;). These do not duplicate his prisoner of war adventures, but recount his upbringing in the area—he was born at Bryn Gwyn, less than a mile from the town—and subsequent return to the area after his years in the armed services. He died in September 2007.

Marion Eames, who was educated at Dr. Williams&#x27; School, lived in Dolgellau up to her death in 2007; she is probably best known for her book &quot;The Secret Room&quot; (originally published in Welsh as &quot;&quot;), a semi-fictional account of the events leading up to the 1686 emigration of Quakers from Dolgellau. It was dramatised by S4C in 2001.

==Local attractions==

The surrounding area is known for its wild but beautiful countryside and places of historical interest. It is popular with tourists who enjoy activities such as walking, hiking, horse riding, white-water rafting and climbing. Dolgellau is the main base for climbers of Cadair Idris. Aircraft enthusiasts also use the town as the base for the Mach Loop. To the north lies the Dolmelynllyn estate, which includes walking routes that include Rhaeadr Ddu waterfall and the former gold mines on Cefn Coch.

The Great Western Railway line from Ruabon to Llangollen was extended via Corwen and Llanuwchllyn to Dolgellau, where it formed an end-on connection with the Cambrian Railways line from Barmouth Junction and a shared station was opened there in 1868. The Ruabon Barmouth line was closed in the 1960s under the Beeching Axe. The railway line was converted some years ago into the &quot;&quot; (or &quot;Mawddach Trail&quot;) which now runs for some eight miles from Dolgellau to Morfa Mawddach railway station, near Fairbourne on the coast. It is maintained by the Snowdonia National Park and is very popular with walkers and cyclists. It passes some estuarine areas that are important for water birds.

The site of Dolgellau railway station itself, along with about of former trackbed, was used to construct the Dolgellau bypass in the late 1970s.Historical attractions, apart from the town itself, include the 12th century Cymer Abbey, a short walk from Dolgellau. The tourist information centre also has an exhibition on Quakers and there is a Quaker graveyard in the town. A field known as Camlan, in nearby Dinas Mawddwy, has been claimed as the site of the last battle of King Arthur (based on a mention of the name in the &quot;&quot;; see also Battle of Camlann).

Dolgellau is a good centre for visiting a number of nearby narrow-gauge heritage railways, including the Corris Railway, the Fairbourne Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.

==Cultural events==

=== Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau ===
Since 1992 Dolgellau has held &#x27; (&quot;The Great Session of Dolgellau&quot;), an annual world music festival. Originally free and held in the streets of the town, it has now grown too big for the centre of Dolgellau. Since 2002 it has been held on the outskirts of the town and admission is charged, which has allowed the organisers in recent years to book such acts as Bob Geldof, Genod droog, Cerys Matthews, , Meic Stevens, Super Furry Animals and Goldie Looking Chain. It attracts crowds of up to 5,000 every year and claims to be one of Europe&#x27;s biggest and best world music festivals. Since 1995 it has been broadcast live on BBC Radio Cymru and since 1997 on S4C. In March 2009 it was announced that there would be no &#x27; in 2009, owing to debts of over £50,000, mostly the result of a wet event in 2007. Smaller musical events took place in pubs, etc., but the future format of the festival was put under review. The festival returned on a smaller scale in 2011, and has been organised annually since then.

=== Gwyl Cefn Gwlad ===
Every summer, Dolgellau is also host to the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Festival of the Countryside&quot;), a mix of agricultural show and fête. Entry is free, but the money raised on the various stalls is given to good causes.

=== Eisteddfod ===
In 1949 Dolgellau hosted the National Eisteddfod of Wales; in 1960 and 1994 it hosted the Urdd National Eisteddfod. The old market hall, Neuadd Idris, hosts the National Centre for Folk Music, known as Tŷ Siamas.

==Twin-town==
Dolgellau is twinned with Guérande () in Brittany, France.

<doc id="627136" wikidata="Q1930032" url="?curid=627136" title="Null modem">
<text>Null modem is a communication method to directly connect two DTEs (computer, terminal, printer, etc.) using an RS-232 serial cable. The name stems from the historical use of RS-232 cables to connect two teleprinter devices or two modems in order to communicate with one another; &quot;null modem&quot; communication refers to using a crossed-over RS-232 cable to connect the teleprinters directly to one another without the modems. 
It is also used to serially connect a computer to a printer, since both are DTE, and is known as a &quot;Printer Cable&quot;.

The RS-232 standard is asymmetric as to the definitions of the two ends of the communications link, assuming that one end is a DTE and the other is a DCE, e.g. a modem. With a null modem connection the transmit and receive lines are crosslinked. Depending on the purpose, sometimes also one or more handshake lines are crosslinked. Several wiring layouts are in use because the null modem connection is not covered by the RS-232 standard.

== Origins ==
Originally, the RS-232 standard was developed and used for teleprinter machines which could communicate with each other over phone lines. Each teleprinter would be physically connected to its modem via an RS-232 connection and the modems could call each other to establish a remote connection between the teleprinters. If a user wished to connect two teleprinters directly without modems (null modem) then they would crosslink the connections. The term &quot;null modem&quot; may also refer to the cable or adapter itself as well as the connection method. Null modem cables were a popular method for transferring data between the early personal computers from the 1980s to the early 1990s.

== Cables and adapters ==
A null modem cable is a RS-232 serial cable where the transmit and receive lines are crosslinked. In some cables there are also handshake lines crosslinked. In many situations a straight-through serial cable is used, together with a null modem adapter. The adapter contains the necessary crosslinks between the signals.

=== Wiring diagrams ===


Below is a very common wiring diagram for a null modem cable to interconnect two DTEs (e.g. two PCs) providing full handshaking, which works with software relying on proper assertion of the &quot;Data Carrier Detect&quot; (DCD) signal:
== Applications ==
The original application of a null modem was to connect two teleprinter terminals directly without using modems. As the RS-232 standard was adopted by other types of equipment, designers needed to decide whether their devices would have DTE-like or DCE-like interfaces. When an application required that two DTEs (or two DCEs) needed to communicate with each other, then a null modem was necessary.

Null modems were commonly used for file transfer between computers, or remote operation. Under the Microsoft Windows operating system, the direct cable connection can be used over a null modem connection. The later versions of MS-DOS were shipped with the InterLnk program. Both pieces of software allow the mapping of a hard disk on one computer as a network drive on the other computer. No Ethernet hardware (such as a network interface card or a modem) is required for this. On the Amiga computer, a null modem connection was a common way of playing multiplayer games between two machines.

The popularity and availability of faster information exchange systems such as Ethernet made the use of null modem cables less common. In modern systems, such a cable can still be useful for kernel mode development, since it allows the user to remotely debug a kernel with a minimum of device drivers and code (a serial driver mainly consists of two FIFO buffers and an interrupt service routine). KGDB for Linux, ddb for BSD, and WinDbg or KD for Windows can be used to remotely debug systems, for example. This can also provide a serial console through which the in-kernel debugger can be dropped to in case of kernel panics, in which case the local monitor and keyboard may not be usable anymore (the GUI reserves those resources and dropping to the debugger in the case of a panic won&#x27;t free them).

Another context where these cables can be useful is when administering &quot;headless&quot; devices providing a serial administration console (i.e. managed switches, rackmount server units, and various embedded systems). An example of embedded systems that widely use null modems for remote monitoring include RTUs, device controllers, and smart sensing devices. These devices tend to reside in close proximity and lend themselves to short run serial communication through protocols such as DNP3, Modbus, and other IEC variants. The Electric, Oil, Gas, and Water Utilities are slow to respond to newer networking technologies which may be due to large investments in capital equipment that has useful service life measured in decades. Serial ports and null modem cables are still widely used in these industries with Ethernet just slowly becoming a widely available option.

== Types of null modem ==
Connecting two DTE devices together requires a null modem that acts as a DCE between the devices by swapping the corresponding signals (TD-RD, DTR-DSR, and RTS-CTS). This can be done with a separate device and two cables, or using a cable wired to do this. If devices require Carrier Detect, it can be simulated by connecting DSR and DCD internally in the connector, thus obtaining CD from the remote DTR signal. One feature of the Yost standard is that a null modem cable is a &quot;rollover cable&quot; that just reverses pins 1 through 8 on one end to 8 through 1 on the other end.

=== No hardware handshaking ===
The simplest type of serial cable has no hardware handshaking. This cable has only the data and signal ground wires connected. All of the other pins have no connection. With this type of cable flow control has to be implemented in the software. The use of this cable is restricted to data-traffic only on its cross-connected Rx and Tx lines. This cable can also be used in devices that do not need or make use of modem control signals.

=== Loopback handshaking ===
Because of the compatibility issues and potential problems with a simple null modem cable, a solution was developed to trick the software into thinking there was handshaking available. However, the cable pin out merely loops back, and does not physically support the hardware flow control.

This cable could be used with more software but it had no actual enhancements over its predecessor. The software would work thinking it had hardware flow control but could suddenly stop when higher speeds were reached and with no identifiable reason.

=== Partial handshaking ===
In this cable the flow control lines are still looped back to the device. However, they are done so in a way that still permits &quot;Request To Send&quot; (RTS) and &quot;Clear To Send&quot; (CTS) flow control but has no actual functionality. The only way the flow control signal would reach the other device is if the opposite device checked for a &quot;Carrier Detect&quot; (CD) signal (at pin 1 on a DE-9 cable and pin 8 on a DB-25 cable). As a result, only specially designed software could make use of this partial handshaking. Software flow control still worked with this cable.

=== Full handshaking ===
This cable is incompatible with the previous types of cables&#x27; hardware flow control, due to a crossing of its RTS/CTS pins. With suitable software, the cable is capable of much higher speeds than its predecessors. It also supports software flow control.

=== Virtual null modem ===
A virtual null modem is a communication method to connect two computer applications directly using a virtual serial port. Unlike a null modem cable, a virtual null modem is a software solution which emulates a hardware null modem within the computer. All features of a hardware null modem are available in a virtual null modem as well. There are some advantages to this:
* Higher transmission speed of serial data, limited only by computer performance and network speed
* Virtual connections over local network or Internet, mitigating cable length restrictions
* Virtually unlimited number of virtual connections
* No need for a serial cable
* The computer&#x27;s physical serial ports remain free

For instance, DOSBox has allowed older DOS games to use virtual null modems.

Another common example consists of Unix pseudoterminals (pty) which present a standard tty interface to user applications, including virtual serial controls. Two such ptys may easily be linked together by an application to form a virtual null modem communication path.

<doc id="627143" wikidata="Q2272941" url="?curid=627143" title="Tywyn">
<text>Tywyn (; ), formerly spelled Towyn, is a town, community, and seaside resort on the Cardigan Bay coast of southern Gwynedd, Wales. It was previously in the historic county of Merionethshire. It is famous as the location of the Cadfan Stone, a stone cross with the earliest known example of written Welsh, and the home of the Talyllyn Railway.

==History of the name==
The name derives from the Welsh &quot;tywyn&quot; (&#x27;beach, seashore, sand-dune&#x27;). The place-name element &quot;tywyn&quot; is found in many other parts of Wales, most notably Towyn near Abergele and Porth Tywyn (Burry Port).

In Middle Welsh, the spelling was generally &quot;Tywyn&quot;. In the Early Modern period, however, the spelling &quot;Towyn&quot; was common in Welsh in order to reflect a slight variation in pronunciation. That also came to be the usual spelling in English up to the latter part of the twentieth century.

With the standardisation of the orthography of the Welsh language in the first part of the 20th century, the spelling &quot;Tywyn&quot; once again became increasingly common in all contexts. In 1967, members of Towyn Urban Council voted to request that the town be officially called &quot;Tywyn&quot; and in July 1967 this was accepted by Merionethshire County Council. Opponents of the change, however, campaigned against it and held an unofficial plebiscite in Tywyn on 25 May 1968. This plebiscite was not administered by the Urban Council or any official body but was organised and financed by tradespeople and the campaign against the spelling &quot;Tywyn&quot;. Those who took part in the vote were asked to decide between &quot;Tywyn&quot; or &quot;Towyn&quot; – a large majority of those who voted favoured &quot;Towyn&quot;. As a result, Tywyn Urban Council (as it now was) requested that decision to use &quot;Tywyn&quot; be revisited. In June 1969, this request was declined by Merionethshire County Council and thus the name has remained as &quot;Tywyn&quot;.

The spelling &quot;Tywyn&quot; better reflects the name&#x27;s history and its pronunciation in modern Welsh. Writing in 1974, Melville Richards, the noted toponymist and professor of Welsh at the University College of North Wales, Bangor explained: &#x27;Mae&#x27;r holl ymrafael ynglŷn â sillebu&#x27;r enw wedi codi am fod cryn ansicrwydd ac amrywio yn Gymraeg gynt rhwng y seiniau &quot;ow&quot; ac &quot;yw&quot;. Ond yn ddiddadl, &quot;Tywyn&quot; yw&#x27;r ffurf gywir&#x27; (&#x27;All of the disagreement about spelling the name arises from the historic uncertainty and variation in Welsh between the sounds &quot;ow&quot; and &quot;yw&quot;. But, without doubt, &quot;Tywyn&quot; is the correct form&#x27;).

In Welsh, the town is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tywyn Meirionnydd&quot;. In origin, this usage probably refers to the cantref of Meirionnydd, but is now generally understood as referring to the historical county of the same name. In English, during the late nineteenth century and until the middle of the twentieth century, the town was sometimes called &quot;Towyn-on-Sea&quot;. 

==History==
Tywyn was the location of the first religious community administered by the Breton saint Cadfan upon his arrival in Gwynedd in the early 6th century, prior to his departure he founded a monastery on Bardsey Island off the Llyn Peninsula. The church contains some early material (see below).

==Location==

The town&#x27;s historic centre lies about a kilometre from the beach, around St Cadfan&#x27;s Church. In the second half of the nineteenth century the town expanded considerably, mainly towards the sea.

To the north of the town lie the reclaimed salt marshes of Morfa Tywyn and Morfa Gwyllt, beyond which lie the Broad Water lagoon and the mouth of the Afon Dysynni. To the north-east lie the rich farmland of Bro Dysynni and the village of Bryncrug, and to the east the hills of Craig y Barcud and Craig Fach Goch. To the south towards Aberdyfi is the mouth of the Afon Dyffryn Gwyn and Morfa Penllyn.

The Tywyn coastal defence scheme, officially unveiled on 24 March 2011 by Jane Davidson (then Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Environment, Sustainability and Housing), provides a rock breakwater above the low-tide level, rock groynes, and rock revetment to protect 80 sea-front properties. The costs of this civil engineering project was £7.62M, shared between the Welsh Assembly Government (£4.135M) and the European Union&#x27;s Regional Development Fund (£3.485M).

== Demography and language ==

At the time of the 2001 census, 40.5% of the population were recorded as Welsh speakers. By the 2011 census this had decreased to 37.5%. An Estyn inspection report in 2016 noted that about 22% of the children at the school came from Welsh-speaking homes.

The town&#x27;s Welsh dialect has several notable features, with one Victorian observer stating that three languages were spoken there: English, Welsh and &#x27;Tywynaeg&#x27;. During the 1860s, in the town&#x27;s British School, a &#x27;Welsh stick&#x27; (a version of the Welsh Not) was used to punish children who were caught speaking Welsh in school. Yet Welsh was the dominant language in Tywyn until the middle of the 20th century. L T C Rolt in his book &#x27;Railway Adventure&#x27; recounts walking up the track of the Talyllyn Railway in 1950, and stopping to speak to railway workers only to discover they spoke no English. Tywyn is now a very anglicised town, with the majority of its population (52.8%) having been born in England according to the 2011 census. Likewise, slightly more respondents claimed an English-only identity (35.0%) than a Welsh-only identity (33.7%).

== Transport and tourism ==

Improved transport links during the 19th century increased Tywyn&#x27;s appeal as a tourist destination. In the early decades of that century, a creek of the river Dysynni allowed ships to approach the town&#x27;s northern fringes, where there was a shipbuilding yard. The draining of the salt marsh and the channelling of the river brought this industry to an end, but during the early part of that century the town was made more accessible by building new roads along the coast to Aberdyfi and Llwyngwril.

The railway arrived in the mid-1860s (first as the Aberystwith and Welsh Coast Railway, then as Cambrian Railways), and had a significant effect on the town. Tywyn railway station opened in 1863. The station is still open, and is served by the Cambrian Line.

Slate-quarrying in the Abergynolwyn area led to the building in 1865 of the Talyllyn Railway, a narrow-gauge line designed to carry slates to Tywyn. Two stations were opened in the town. Tywyn Wharf railway station was originally opened to enable slates to be unloaded onto a wharf adjacent to the main railway line. It is now the Talyllyn&#x27;s western terminus and principal station. Pendre railway station was originally the passenger station, and now houses the locomotive and carriage sheds and works.

Notable visitors who stayed at Tywyn in the 19th century include:
* Thomas Love Peacock (1811, at Botalog)
* Thomas Fremantle, 1st Baron Cottesloe (1818)
* Ignatius Spencer (1818)
* Charles Darwin (1819, at Plas Edwards)
* William Morris (1875)
* Elizabeth Blackwell (exact date uncertain, at Brynarfor)
* Sir Rupert Kettle (who built Glan-y-don as a holiday home in 1866)

The beach and its extensive promenade have long been key attractions. In 1877, a pier was built towards the northern end of the beach, but the structure only lasted a few months. The street called &#x27;Pier Road&#x27;, which leads from the town to the beach, offers a suggestion as to its location. The promenade was completed in 1889 at the cost of some £30,000, paid for by John Corbett (1817–1901) of Ynysymaengwyn.

There has been extensive bungalow and caravan development in the vicinity.

== Other industries ==
Apart from tourism, agriculture has long been the most important industry in the area. Lead and copper used to be mined in the town&#x27;s hinterland.

The Marconi Company built a Long Wave receiver station in Tywyn in 1914, working in duplex with the high-power transmitter station near Waunfawr. In 1921 the Tywyn and Waunfawr stations initiated a transatlantic wireless telegraph service with a similar RCA wireless transmitting station in New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA and RCA&#x27;s receiver station in Belmar, New Jersey. This new transatlantic service replaced Marconi&#x27;s obsolete transatlantic telegraph station in Clifden, Ireland following its 1922 destruction during the Irish Civil War.

For most of the 20th century, the armed forces were a significant presence in Tywyn. The town was a major training ground for the amphibious warfare landings in the Second World War and had a strategic war base. Abandoned pillboxes may still be seen on the coast to the south of the town. RAF Towyn opened on 8 September 1940 as an air-cooperation base for the Royal Artillery Anti-Aircraft Practice Camp at Tonfanau, but closed on 25 July 1945. The links with the armed forces came to an end when the Joint Service Mountain Training Centre at Morfa Camp closed in 1999. Morfa camp is now in private ownership and many buildings are let as small storage units.

== Facilities and notable features ==
Much of the town&#x27;s infrastructure was put in place by an industrialist from the English Midlands, John Corbett, who in the 1870s decided to develop the town into a major tourist resort to rival Torquay. As well as constructing a row of boarding houses and a grand esplanade, he developed the water and sewerage system. He gave land and money for a new Market Hall, built to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897. He paid for Brynarfor (formerly a private school originally called the Towyn Academy and then Brynarvor Hall School) to be opened as &#x27;Towyn Intermediate School&#x27; in 1894. He refurbished the Corbet Arms Hotel (from then on spelled with two &#x27;t&#x27;s), and also contributed to the Assembly Room (1893), now the Magic Lantern Cinema. Plaques commemorating his generosity may still be seen on the north end of the promenade and on the Market Hall. Another commemorative plaque was on Brynarfor (now demolished), and his portrait was hung there when the school first opened. However, the anticipated grand watering-place never took off, and these additions to the town were never matched.

In 1912, a drill hall was built in the Pendre area of the town for the Territorial Army (the 7th Battalion the Royal Welsh Fusiliers). The hall, now known as Neuadd Pendre, has recently been renovated, mainly with money from the National Lottery Big Lottery Fund and the Welsh Government. The hall houses a 3-manual 9-rank Wurlitzer Organ which was originally installed in a cinema in Woolwich in 1937.

After the First World War money was raised to build both the Tywyn Cottage Hospital (opened in 1922) and the Tywyn Institute (opened by David Lloyd George in 1926). The hospital is still in operation, but the institute is now closed. It was the location of the town&#x27;s library before a new library building was built next to it in the early 1970s.

The main schools in Tywyn are the primary school, Ysgol Penybryn, and the secondary school, Ysgol Uwchradd Tywyn.

Local places of interest include Craig yr Aderyn (Bird Rock), Castell y Bere, Llanfendigaid Estate and Llyn Myngul (Tal-y-llyn Lake). Hen Dyffryn Gwyn is a Grade II listed building dating from 1640 which retains many of its original features.

== Religion ==
For many centuries, St Cadfan&#x27;s church was the only place of worship in the town, but since the 19th century there have been several.

Following the Methodist Revival, the Calvinistic Methodists established a cause (i.e. a branch) in Tywyn at the end of the 18th century. Bethel Calvinistic Methodist Church (Welsh-speaking Presbyterian Church of Wales) was established in 1815. The current chapel was built in 1871 and altered in 1887. The chapel closed in early 2010 but services are still held in the vestry.

Bethany Calvinistic Methodist Chapel (English-speaking Presbyterian Church of Wales) was also built in 1871 as one of the &#x27;Inglis Côs&#x27; (&#x27;English cause&#x27;) chapels that were advocated by Lewis Edwards and fiercely criticised by Emrys ap Iwan. It was opened in part with a view to attracting the increasing numbers of visitors who were coming to Tywyn since the opening of the railway and who previously had been provided for only by the English services at St Cadfan&#x27;s. The noted pacifist George Maitland Lloyd Davies was minister of Bethany and also of Maethlon Chapel in nearby Cwm Maethlon (Happy Valley) between 1926 and 1930. Bethany closed in 2016.

Ebeneser (Welsh-speaking Wesleyan Methodist Church in Wales) was first built between 1817 and 1820, with the current building dating from 1883. John Cadvan Davies (1846–1923), Archdruid of Wales in 1923, was minister of Ebeneser between 1889 and 1892.

Bethesda Independent Chapel (Welsh-speaking Congregationalist) was first built in 1820, enlarged in 1865 and rebuilt again in 1892. It closed in January 2010.

Tywyn Baptist Church (English-speaking) was opened in 1900 and re-built in its present form in 1991.

The Church of St David is the town&#x27;s Roman Catholic church and is part of Dolgellau Deanery. In its grounds is a sculpture of St David in Welsh slate by John Skelton.

== Sport ==
In Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Wales&quot; (1833) it is reported that popular horse races were held on land to the north of the town every September. Between 1904 and 1947, Towyn Golf Club (originally the Towyn-on-Sea Golf Club) was also located on land to the north of the town.

The Towyn-on-Sea club opened with a 10-hole course in 1904, in 1906 a further eight holes were added. Attempts were made to re-establish the club following the Second World War but these proved unsuccessful.

In the past Tywyn has had a rugby union team, and it now shares a football team with neighbouring Bryncrug (Tywyn &amp; Bryncrug F.C.), playing their home matches in the village of Bryncrug. It also has a cricket club, Tywyn and District CC and a hockey team known as Dysynni Hockey Club. Also based in Tywyn is the Bro Dysynni Athletics Club.

<doc id="627149" wikidata="Q1438739" url="?curid=627149" title="Fort St. George">
<text>Fort St. George (or historically, White Town) is a fortress at the coastal city of Chennai, India. Founded in 1639, it was the first English (later British) fortress in India. The construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading activity, in what was originally an uninhabited land. Thus, it is a feasible contention to say that the city (formerly named Madras) evolved around the fortress. The fort currently houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and other official buildings.

==History==
The East India Company (EIC), which had entered India around 1600 for trading activities, had begun licensed trading at Surat, which was its initial bastion. However, to secure its trade lines and commercial interests in the spice trade, it felt the necessity of a port closer to the Malaccan Straits. Thanks to negotiations led by Francis Day with ruler of Chandragiri in 1639, English succeeded in purchasing a piece of coastal land, originally called &quot;Chennirayarpattinam&quot; or &quot;Channapatnam&quot;, where the Company began the construction of a harbour and a fort. &lt;br&gt;
The fort was completed on 23 April 1644 at a cost of £3,000, coinciding with St. George&#x27;s Day, celebrated in honour of the patron saint of England. The fort, hence christened Fort St. George, faced the sea and some fishing villages, and it soon became the hub of merchant activity. It gave birth to a new settlement area called George Town (historically referred to as Black Town), which grew to envelop the villages and led to the formation of the city of Madras. It also helped to establish English influence over the Carnatic region and to keep the kings of Arcot and Srirangapatna, as well as the French forces based at Pondicherry, at bay. In 1665, after the EIC received word of the formation of the new French East India Company, the fort was strengthened and enlarged while its garrison was increased.

According to the 17th-century merchant and traveller Thomas Bowrey, Fort St. George was:

without all dispute a beneficial place to the Honourable English India Company, and with all the Residence of theire Honourable Agent and Governour all of their Affaires Upon this Coast and the Coast of Gingalee, the Kingdoms also of Orixa, (Orissa) Bengala (Bengal), and Pattana (Patna), the said Governour and his Councell here resideigne, for the Honour of our English Nation keepinge and maintainneinge the place in great Splendour, Civil and good Government, Entertaineinge nobly all Foraign Embassadors, and provideinge great quantities of Muzlinge (Muslin) Callicoes (Calico) &amp;c. to be yearly transported to England.

The Fort is a stronghold with walls that withstood a number of assaults in the 18th century. It briefly passed into the possession of the French from 1746 to 1749, but was restored to Great Britain under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which ended the War of the Austrian Succession.

The Fort now serves as one of the administrative headquarters for the legislative assembly of Tamil Nadu state and it still houses a garrison of troops in transit to various locations at South India and the Andamans. The Fort Museum contains many relics of the &quot;Raj&quot; era, including portraits of many of the Governors of Madras. The fort is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, with the administrative support of the Indian Army.

===The church===
St. Mary&#x27;s Church is the oldest Anglican church in India. It was built between 1678 and 1680 on the orders of the then Agent of Madras Streynsham Master. The tombstones in its graveyard are the oldest English or British tombstones in India. This ancient prayer house solemnised the marriages of Robert Clive and Governor Elihu Yale, who later became the first benefactor of Yale University in the United States.

===Museum===
The Fort Museum, which is the only ticketed institution of the Archaeological Survey of India in the complex, exhibits many items of the period of English and later British rule. This building was completed in 1795 and first housed the office of the Madras Bank. The hall upstairs was the Public Exchange Hall and served as a place for public meetings, lottery draws and occasional entertainment. These relics are reminders of British rule in India. The objects on display in the museum are the weapons, coins, medals, uniforms and other artefacts from England, Scotland, France and India dating back to the colonial period. Original letters written by Clive and Cornwallis make fascinating reading. One set of quaint period uniforms is displayed for viewing, as well. However, the &quot;pièce de resistance&quot; is a large statue of Lord Cornwallis.

The National Flag of India was designed by Pingali Venkayya and adopted in its present form during the meeting of the Constituent Assembly held on 22 July 1947, a few days before India&#x27;s independence from Britain on 15 August 1947. The first ever flag flown after the independence is stored in the third floor of the museum. The public are allowed to see but not to touch or take photographs.

The museum is mentioned in the novel &quot;The Museum of Innocence&quot;, by the Turkish Nobel Laureate Orhan Pamuk.

===Wellesley House===
The first floor of the building includes the Banqueting Hall, which holds paintings of the Governor of the Fort and other high officials of the administration. The cannons of Tipu Sultan decorate the ramparts of the museum. The statue stands at the entrance near a stairway in the museum. This statue was created by Charles Bank in England to be brought to India. The pedestal of the statue is carved with a scene depicting Tipu Sultan&#x27;s emissary. The house takes its name from Richard Wellesley, Governor General of India, and brother of the Duke of Wellington.

===Flagstaff===
The flagstaff at the fort is one of the tallest in the country. Made of teakwood, it is high.

==Namakkal Kavignar Maligai==
Namakkal Kavingar Maligai is a 10-storeyed building at the campus and is the power centre of state secretariat. It houses offices of the secretaries and departments. Between 2012 and 2014, the building was renovated at a cost of , with additional facilities like centralised air-conditioning and new electrical wiring system.

===In recent years===
The entire complex is administered by the Department of Defence. The fort building is a three-storeyed one housing the offices of the chief minister and other ministers, the chief secretary, home ministry, treasury, etc. The remaining offices are housed in the 10-storeyed Namakkal Kavingyar Maaligai, which houses more than 30 departments.

The Fort St. George complex housed the administrative buildings of the Government of Tamil Nadu till March 2010. The Legislature of Tamil Nadu and the secretariat (with headquarters of various government departments) were situated in the fort. The fort itself was open to the public however only to a certain area. The main building or the secretariat was open only to government officials and the police. The cannons and the moat which guarded this old building have been left untouched. In 2010 the legislature and the secretariat moved to a new location and the old assembly complex was converted into a library for the Central Institute of Classical Tamil. Following the 2011 assembly elections and the return of J Jayalalithaa as the Chief Minister of the State, the Tamil Nadu Assembly and the Secretariat have been restored to Fort St. George.

==Other monuments==
An arch commemorating the diamond jubilee of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly is under construction near the Fort on Rajaji Salai close to Napier Bridge. The structure is a replica of Fort St. George&#x27;s façade. The arch will be rectangular in structure with a height of and a width of being built at a cost of . The structure will be a mix of old and modern architecture, inspired by the frontage of Fort St. George. The legend &#x27;Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly diamond jubilee commemorative arch&#x27; would be inscribed in English and Tamil, in addition to the words &#x27;60 years&#x27;. The chief minister J Jayalalithaa laid the foundation stone for the arch on 30 October 2012. Earlier, the arch was planned to be constructed close to the entrance of Fort St. George, but was later relocated beyond the prohibitive zone, as per AMASR Act. A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Madras High Court opposing the move stating that the arch would choke Rajaji Salai that leads to the High Court. However, the petition was dismissed by a division bench on 9 January 2013.

<text>Garrulax is a genus of passerine birds in the laughingthrush family Leiothrichidae.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Garrulax&quot; was erected by the French naturalist René Lesson in 1831. The type species was designated in 1961 as the rufous-fronted laughingthrush (&quot;Garrulax rufifrons&quot;).

The genus previously included more species. Following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, &quot;Garrulax &quot; was split up and species were moved to the resurrected genera &quot;Ianthocincla&quot; and &quot;Pterorhinus&quot;.

&quot;Garrulax&quot; species are heavily traded as songbirds. A survey of eight bird markets in Indonesia, carried out in 2014–2015, found 615 laughingthrushes of nine species openly for sale. Much of the trade in these species in Indonesia is illegal and is pushing a number of these species towards extinction. The Sumatran Laughingthrush, for example, is in serious decline due to ongoing and uncontrolled illegal trade in bird markets on the islands of Java and Sumatra, and is increasingly found in international trade, though in lower numbers.

===Species===
The genus contains the following 14 species:

<text>Nicholas Aylward Vigors (1785 – 26 October 1840) was an Irish zoologist and politician. He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system.

==Early life==

Vigors was born at Old Leighlin, County Carlow, in 1785. He was the first son of Capt. Nicholas Aylward Vigors, who served in the 29th (Worcestershire) Regiment, and his first wife, Catherine Vigors, daughter of Solomon Richards of Solsborough. He matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford, in November 1803, and was admitted at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in November 1806. Without completing his studies, he served in the army during the Peninsular War from 1809 to 1811 and was wounded in the Battle of Barossa on 5 March 1811. Though he had not yet completed his studies, he still published &quot;An inquiry into the nature and extent of poetick licence&quot; in London in 1810. He then returned to Oxford to continue his studies and achieved his Bachelor of Arts in 1817 and Master of Arts in 1818. He practiced as a barrister and became a Doctor of Civil Law in 1832.

==Zoology==

Vigors was a co-founder of the Zoological Society of London in 1826, and its first secretary until 1833. In that year, he founded what became the Royal Entomological Society of London. He was a fellow of the Linnean Society and the Royal Society. He was the author of 40 papers, mostly on ornithology. He described 110 species of birds, enough to rank him among the top 30 bird authors historically. He provided the text for John Gould&#x27;s &quot;A Century of Birds from the Himalaya Mountains&quot; (1830–32).

One bird that he described was &quot;Sabine&#x27;s snipe&quot;. This was treated as a common snipe by Barrett-Hamilton in 1895 and by Meinertzhagen in 1926 but was thought to be probably a Wilson&#x27;s snipe in 1945. Vigors lent a skin for later editions of Thomas Bewick&#x27;s &quot;History of British Birds&quot;.

==Politics==

Vigors succeeded to his father&#x27;s estate in 1828. He was MP for the borough of Carlow from 1832 until 1835. He briefly represented County Carlow in 1835. Vigors had been elected in a by-election in June after the Conservative MPs originally returned at the 1835 United Kingdom general election were unseated on petition and a new writ issued. On 19 August 1835, Vigors and his running mate, in the two-member county constituency, were unseated on petition. The same two Conservatives who had previously been unseated were awarded the seats. On the death of one of them, Vigors won the subsequent by-election in 1837 and retained the seat until his own death.
