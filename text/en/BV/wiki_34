<text>The Armstrong oscillator (also known as the Meissner oscillator) is an electronic oscillator circuit which uses an inductor and capacitor to generate an oscillation. The Meissner patent from 1913 describes a device for generating electrical vibrations, a radio transmitter used for on–off keying. Edwin Armstrong presented in 1915 some recent developments in the Audion receiver. His circuits improved radio frequency reception. Meissner used a Lieben-Reisz-Strauss tube, Armstrong used a de Forest Audion tube. Both circuits are sometimes called a tickler oscillator because the distinguishing feature is that the feedback signal needed to produce oscillations is magnetically coupled into the tank inductor by a &quot;tickler coil&quot; &quot;(L2, right)&quot;. Assuming the coupling is weak but sufficient to sustain oscillation, the oscillation frequency &quot;f&quot; is determined primarily by the LC circuit (tank circuit L1 and C in the figure on the right) and is approximately given by

:formula_1

This circuit was widely used in the regenerative radio receiver, popular until the 1940s. In that application, the input radio frequency signal from the antenna is magnetically coupled into the LC circuit by an additional winding, and the feedback is reduced with adjustable gain control in the feedback loop, so the circuit is just short of oscillation. The result is a narrow-band radio-frequency filter and amplifier. The non-linear characteristic of the transistor or tube also demodulated the RF signal to produce the audio signal.

The circuit diagram shown is a modern implementation, using a field-effect transistor as the amplifying element. Armstrong&#x27;s original design used a triode vacuum tube.

In the Meissner variant, the LC resonant circuit is exchanged with the feedback coil, i.e., in the output path (vacuum tube plate, field-effect transistor drain, or bipolar transistor collector) of the amplifier (e.g., Grebennikov, Fig. 2.8). Many publications, however, embrace both variants with either name. English speakers call it the &quot;Armstrong oscillator&quot;, whereas German speakers call it the &quot;Meißner oscillator&quot;.

<text>Prahran ( , also colloquially or ), is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 5 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Stonnington local government area. Prahran recorded a population of 12,203 at the 2021 census.

Prahran is a part of Greater Melbourne, with many shops, restaurants and cafes. Chapel Street is a mix of upscale fashion boutiques and cafes. Greville Street, once the centre of Melbourne&#x27;s hippie community, has many cafés, bars, restaurants, bookstores, clothing shops and music shops.

Prahran takes its name from Pur-ra-ran, a Boonwurrung word which was thought to mean &quot;land partially surrounded by water&quot;. When naming began the suburbs spelling was intended to be Praharan and pronounced Pur-ra-ran, but a spelling mistake on a government form lead to the name Prahran. More recently the word Pur-ra-ran has been identified as a transcription of &quot;Birrarung&quot;, the name for the Yarra River, or a specific point of it.

==History==


In 1837 George Langhorne named the area Pur-ra-ran, which was thought to be a compound of two Aboriginal words, meaning &quot;land partially surrounded by water&quot;. The word has more recently been identified as a transcription of &quot;Birrarung&quot;, the name for the Yarra River or a specific point of it. When Langhorne informed the Surveyor-General Robert Hoddle of the name, it was written as &quot;Prahran&quot;.

Prahran Post Office opened on 1 April 1853.

Describing Prahran, as it was in the mid 1850s, F. R. Chapman remembered:


The Prahran Brotherhood (1910–1919) was a men-only pressure group aiming at raising the status of the district. Ostensibly non-sectarian but closely associated with the Congregational Church, it opposed gambling, wine bars opening on Sundays, and preference to unionists.

Between the 1890s and 1930s Prahran built up a huge shopping centre, which by the 1920s had rivalled the Melbourne Central Business District. Large emporiums (department stores) sprang up along Chapel Street. Prahran also became a major entertainment area. The Lyric theatre (also known as the fleahouse), built on the corner of Victoria Street in 1911, burnt down in the 1940s. The Royal was the second old theatre built. The Empress (also known as the flea palace), another popular theatre on Chapel Street, was destroyed by fire in 1971. The site was operated by the cut-price clothes and homewares chain Waltons for the next decade and was later developed into the Chapel Street Bazaar.

In the 1960s, in an effort to boost the slowly growing local population and inject new life into the suburb, the Victorian Government opened the Prahran Housing Commission estate, just off Chapel Street, together with a larger estate, located just north in South Yarra. Further complementing the high rise developments was a low density development between Bangs and Bendigo Streets.

In the 1970s, the suburb began to gentrify, with much of the remaining old housing stock being renovated and restored. The area had a substantial Greek population and many took advantage of the rise in property values during the 1980s, paving the way for further development and a subsequent shift in demographics.

During the 1990s, the population increased markedly, with demand for inner-city living fuelling a medium-density housing boom, which continues in the area, as part of the Melbourne 2030 planning policy. It was during the 1990s that solidification of the area&#x27;s gay community occurred, with many gay and gay-friendly businesses, the last of these closing around 2012.

==Demographics==

In the 2021 census, there were 12,203 people in Prahran. 63.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.6%, New Zealand (3.2%), Greece (2.7%), China (1.5%) and India (1.4%). 75.5% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek (4.9%), Mandarin (1.9%), Spanish (1.5%), Italian (0.9%) and French (0.8%). The most common responses for religion were No Religion (52.3%) and Catholic (14.7%).

==Local landmarks==
===Non-residential architecture===

Prahran is home to a large collection of architecturally significant commercial buildings, with many on the Victorian Heritage Register.

The Chapel Street section of Prahran is notable for its collection of turn of the century emporiums and large buildings, which include:

* &quot;Prahran Arcade&quot; – Built in 1889 on Chapel Street, is a richly detailed building both externally and internally. Retains the original arcade, but decorative roof was removed in the 1950s. Also known locally as &quot;Birdland&quot; due to pigeons which once bred in the recessed balconies of the building and the large eagles which adorn the facade, but are now screened by chicken wire. Was a Dan Murphy&#x27;s cellar for many years, but currently a JB HiFi store. Heritage listed
* &quot;Read&#x27;s Stores&quot; – Built in 1914 on the corner of Chapel Street and Commercial Road by architectural firm Sydney Smith &amp; Ogg. The heritage-listed building is a prominent example of large department stores which once lined the west side of Chapel Street up to High Street. Its twin beacons, which sit atop large copper clad domes, were once visible like lighthouses for miles around, but no longer operate. During the 1970s, the site traded as a department store under the name &quot;Moore&#x27;s&quot; before the lower stories were converted into shops in the 1980s and named Pran Central. The upper stories were restored and converted into fashionable apartments in 2005.
* &quot;Big Store&quot; – Built in 1902 and closed in 1968 on Chapel Street. A second store, almost as large as the main store, once stood in the carpark to the west, beyond Cato Street, linked by cross-over walkways. This large Edwardian building is currently used by Coles Supermarkets.
* &quot;Maples Corner&quot; – Built in 1910 on the corner of Chapel and High Streets. Converted into offices in the 1980s and many deteriorating decorative features were replaced with post modern elements.
* &quot;Love &amp; Lewis&quot; – Built in 1913 on Chapel Street and converted into a mix of offices, retail and apartments in 2004. Now heritage registered.

Other significant Prahran emporiums include Conway&#x27;s Buildings (1914) and the large Colosseum building (1897), which was lost to fire in 1914.

Other heritage buildings include the former Prahran Town Hall (now vacant), the adjacent former City Hall (1888) (now unused), the neighbouring police station (1887) and court house (1887) and Rechabite Hall (1888), in the Second Empire style. The Prahran Fire Tower (1889) is on Macquarie Street. State School number 2855, formerly Prahran Primary School (1888), on High Street was converted into apartments in 2005. St Matthew&#x27;s Church, a large bluestone church on High Street built in the 1880s, was partly converted into offices in the 1980s.

===Residential architecture===

Residential Prahran consists of mostly single storey Victorian and Edwardian terrace houses, with some larger double storey terraces closer to the main shopping strips.

===Public space===
Prahran features many small, typically hidden gardens scattered throughout the suburb. The former Prahran Gardens, now &quot;Grattan Gardens&quot;, are on the corner of Greville Street and Grattan Street and feature a playground and heritage bandstand. The Princes Gardens on Malvern Road, are a small garden, which features Chapel Off Chapel, an old church converted into a theatre, as well as the Prahran skate park. Victoria Gardens, on High Street, is a Victorian-era garden designed by landscape designer William Sangster in 1885. It features a sunken oval surrounded by London plane trees and a Victory bronze statue. The Orrong Romanis Reserve is the largest park in Prahran, although the Cato Street carpark has been converted into an urban square named Prahran Square.

==Education==

Prahran was home to Prahran College, a secondary and tertiary technical college and trade school that originated in Chapel Street as, and continued to be associated with, the Mechanics Institute. It incorporated an art school which particularly from around the 1960s produced graduates who went on to become significant Australians. From 1968 it was situated in a multi-storey building in High Street, demolished in 2017 for the construction by the Andrews government of a $25 million &#x27;vertical&#x27; secondary college, next to Melbourne Polytechnic and the National Institute of Circus Arts, and which opened in 2019. Alumni include painters Howard Arkley, Douglas Baulch, Christopher Beaumont, Peter Churcher, William Dargie, Robert Jacks, William Kelly, David Larwill; printmakers Basil Hadley and Merris Hillard; designers Mimmo Cozzolino and Martine Murray; photographers Robert Ashton, Andrew Chapman, Susan Fereday, Bill Henson, Carol Jerrems, Tony Maskill, Leonie Reisberg, Stephen Wickham and sculptor Stuart Devlin.

<doc id="617334" wikidata="Q1442042" url="?curid=617334" title="Daedalus (crater)">
<text>Daedalus is a prominent crater located near the center of the far side of the Moon. The inner wall is d, and there is a cluster of central peaks on the relatively flat floor. Because of its location (shielded from radio emissions from the Earth), it has been proposed as the site of a future giant radio telescope, which would be scooped out of the crater itself, much like the Arecibo radio telescope, but on a vastly larger scale.

The crater is named after Daedalus of Greek myth. It is pictured in famous photographs taken by the Apollo 11 astronauts. In contemporary sources it was called &quot;Crater 308&quot; (this was a temporary IAU designation that preceded the establishment of far-side lunar nomenclature).

Nearby craters of note include Icarus to the east and Racah to the south. Less than a crater diameter to the north-northeast is Lipskiy.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Daedalus.

<doc id="617337" wikidata="Q456052" url="?curid=617337" title="Fusajiro Yamauchi">
<text>, originally born as , was a Japanese entrepreneur who founded Yamauchi Nintendo, later known as Nintendo. Yamauchi lived in Kyoto, Japan and had a wife and two daughters—one of whom was Tei Yamauchi, who later married Sekiryō Kaneda, the successor and second president of Nintendo.

== Early life ==
Fusajirō Fukui was born on November 22, 1859, as the oldest son of Sōsuke Fukui, a craftsperson. Fusajirō took the name Yamauchi after an arranged marriage with one of the daughters of the Yamauchi family, who owned a company named Haigan dealing with lime. Since the Yamauchi family had no male heirs to inherit the company, Fusajirō was adopted by the Yamauchis and became the heir to his adoptive father, Naoshichi Yamauchi.

Shortly after, in 1885, Fusajirō inherited the company at the age of 17 and renamed it Haikyō.
==Yamauchi Fusajirō Shōten or Yamauchi Nintendo==
In the context of the Meiji Restoration, in 1885, gambling laws were relaxed in Japan, and Hanafuda cards, which were previously banned, become legal. Fusajiro, after having opened other shops selling lime in Kyoto, was inspired by both the booming business of Hanafuda and his personal taste for the game. He played it regularly and decided to use his skills as a craftsperson to open a factory building handmade Hanafuda decks.

On September 23, 1889, Fusajiro Yamauchi opened Yamauchi Fusajirō Shōten, also known as Yamauchi Nintendo (other sources also mention the name Nintendo Koppai), at the location of an unoccupied house he had purchased. Fusajiro crafted the Hanafuda decks using mulberry bark, clay and a wood-block printing machine that he designed himself. The Hanafuda decks sold by Nintendo, known as Daitōryō (i.e President) decks, were recognizable thanks to the illustration of Napoleon that adorned them and became highly successful in Kyoto within a few years.
In 1890, Nintendo expands its products and starts selling Uta-garuta decks. However, it soon faced challenges in selling its Hanafuda and Uta-garuta due to competition and a shrinking market in its vicinity. Fusajiro then had the idea of using the Hanafuda cards of lesser quality that had been discarded and selling them in new decks called &quot;Tengu&quot;, which were priced lower than the Daitōryō decks. Additionally, Fusajiro decided to target the clubhouse market. These places never used the same deck twice to prevent cheating, resulting in high deck turnover. In the end, Fusajiro managed to secure contracts with around 70 clubhouses, each using at least 50 decks per night.

=== Nintendo and trump cards ===
Just as Hanafuda cards were allowed again in 1885, so too did occidental playing cards (the Standard 52-card deck) become allowed. These western cards, called ‘Trump’ by the Japanese population, truly began to achieve success in 1886. It was by witnessing their popularity and recognizing that they were primarily purchased by the wealthy upper class due to their high prices from exportation that Fusajiro had the idea to produce his own Trump cards instead of importing them.

Although 1907 is most commonly cited as the date when Nintendo started selling their own manufactured western playing cards, a 1974 presentation flyer by the company cites 1911 as the year when trump decks started being made. Moreover, Nintendo&#x27;s website lists 1902 as the year &quot;Mr. Yamauchi started manufacturing the first western-style playing cards in Japan.&quot; According to author Florent Gorges, the date 1902 comes from the website of Watada Insatsujo (Watada Printings), a printing company that still works with Nintendo today and has done so since 1899. Indeed, on their website, it is written (translated): &quot;1902: Beginning of the prints of &quot;Trump&quot; playing cards for Nintendo Koppai.&quot;

The decision by Fusajiro to start selling western playing cards made in Japan happened at a fortuitous time for Nintendo. In the same year, the imperial government implemented a new tax on mah-jong and cards producers called the &quot;Koppai Zei&quot; or &quot;Karuta Zei&quot;. This tax of 20 sen, created to prepare for future armed conflicts (the sen is a subdivision of the Japanese yen, which became obsolete in 1954), doubled the price of most Hanafuda decks. These decks were also sold for around 20 sen, leading to more than half of the main producers of Hanafuda cards closing their shops. The western cards served as a lifeline for Nintendo, which was the only company selling these made-in-Japan western cards at the time.

=== Distribution across Japan ===
Limited to the Osaka and Kyoto region, Fusajiro had the idea to create a distribution network to expand Nintendo’s operations throughout all of Japan. This was something unheard of at the time, as only drugs and tobacco possessed that kind of distribution.

And so, in 1907, Fusajiro expanded Nintendo’s operations by making a deal with Nihon Senbai (now Japan Tobacco) to sell Nintendo cards in cigarette shops throughout all of Japan. By the time of Fusajiro’s death in 1929, Nintendo had become the largest playing-card company in Japan.

==Personal details==
Without a son, Fusajiro decided to arrange a marriage in 1905 between Sekiryō Kaneda, an employee who started working at Nintendo at the beginning of the decade, and one of his two daughters, Tei. Over the next decades, Sekiryō would lead both the Nintendo and Haikyō companies alongside his stepfather until 1929, the year in which Fusajiro retired, and Sekiryō Yamauchi inherited both companies.

<text>The Lim bay (, ) and valley is a peculiar geographic feature found near Rovinj-Rovigno and Vrsar-Orsera on the western coast of Istria, south of Poreč-Parenzo, Croatia. The name comes from the Latin for &quot;limit&quot;, referring to the landform&#x27;s position at the border of two Roman provinces: Dalmatia and Italia.

==Geography==

The Lim valley () is the 35 km long valley of the river Pazinčica, which transforms into the Lim bay (), a 10 kilometer long estuary. The Croats sometimes also call it (&quot;Lim channel&quot;), due to its narrow width. The estuary is sometimes called a fjord, although it is not in fact a fjord but a ria, because it was not carved by a glacier but by the river eroding the ground on its way to the Adriatic Sea, when the sea level was lower.
Owing to its geological history, this estuary is one of the most instructive examples of limestone hydrological development. The Lim stream used to flow through the valley but dried up regularly, and was really only present after the heavy rain. The Lim estuary has the appearance of a canyon. The side rises to 150 m, sinking to 20 m when they reach the sea; they are overgrown with maquis and have some special characteristics. The south bank, facing the north, is covered with deciduous trees (oak and ash), while the north bank, facing the sun, has more evergreen flora. The vegetation has recently suffered a great deal from fires. The estuary is rich in fish, and high quality oysters and mussels. Because of the special conditions of the sea water in the channel (less salt content, a higher concentration of dissolved oxygen and well-researched temperature gradients) sea flora and fauna are particularly well developed.

The channel is a natural breeding ground and wintering place for many breeds of fish. For this reason it is a special reserve, protected by a conservation order. The locals grow some fish and oysters there.

==In popular culture==
The movie &quot;The Long Ships&quot; starring Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier was shot there in 1964.

<text>City of Heroes (CoH) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game originally created by Cryptic Studios prior to the IP’s acquisition by NCSoft. Previously developed by the now-defunct Paragon Studios, it is currently developed by several private servers. One of them being Homecoming Servers who have a limited license from NCSoft. The game was launched in North America on April 28, 2004, and in Europe by NCsoft Europe on February 4, 2005, with English, German and French servers. In the game, players created super-powered player characters that could team up with others to complete missions and fight criminals belonging to various gangs and organizations in the fictional Paragon City.

Twenty-three free major updates for &quot;City of Heroes&quot; were released before its shutdown. The final live update, &quot;Where Shadows Lie&quot;, was released on May 31, 2012. On August 31, 2012, NCsoft terminated its Paragon Studios development team, ending all production on &quot;City of Heroes&quot; with the last day of services on November 30, 2012.

In April 2019, source code capable of running a &quot;City of Heroes&quot; server was distributed widely. This made it possible to create &quot;City of Heroes&quot; servers outside the direct purview of NCSoft and revived interest in the game, which by then had been out of development for more than six years.

On January 4, 2024, NCSoft granted Homecoming Servers, LLC, who operated the rogue server &quot;Homecoming: City of Heroes&quot; an official license to host the game. 

==Production history==
In 2000, writer Rick Dakan and Michael Lewis created Cryptic Studios. The company&#x27;s first project was &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, the idea for the game which Dakan claims to have come up with. Dakan was named Lead Design on the game, doing mostly writing for characters and story. Even after resigning from Cryptic, Dakan remained involved with the game through the publishing of the &quot;City of Heroes&quot; comic book. 

On October 31, 2005, the game&#x27;s first sequel, &quot;City of Villains&quot; (&quot;CoV&quot;), was launched, allowing players to play as supervillains. The stand-alone expansion pack did not require &quot;City of Heroes&quot; to run, but if the user had both games, content was added to the &quot;City of Heroes&quot; side of game play. On July 16, 2008, NCsoft merged the two games&#x27; content together. Thus, a player who only owned &quot;City of Heroes&quot; could now play &quot;City of Villains&quot;, and vice versa. Prior to this, a purchase was required to access either game&#x27;s content, but they were linked by one account and subscription fee.

On November 6, 2007, NCsoft announced their purchase of the &quot;City of Heroes&quot;/&quot;City of Villains&quot; intellectual property and transitioned the staff from Cryptic Studios to a new location in Mountain View, California, to continue development of the game. The new studio on April 14, 2009, became Paragon Studios, which shared credit with Cryptic Studios for the development work. This then led to &quot;City of Heroes&quot; becoming available for download on Steam, along with other NCsoft titles, on April 22, 2009.

On October 30, 2008, NCsoft announced a partnership with Transgaming Technologies in order to bring both &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot; and all 13 expansions to Mac OS X.

The &quot;City of Heroes: Going Rogue&quot; expansion&#x27;s release was announced on May 11, 2009. This part of the game centered on the alternate reality of Praetoria and featured a new alignment system allowing players characters to shift allegiances between Heroes and Villains, giving characters access to both Paragon City of &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and the Rogue Isles of &quot;City of Villains&quot;. Paragon Studios described this as &quot;[exploring] the shades of gray that lay between Heroes and Villains&quot;. &quot;Going Rogue&quot; was released on August 17, 2010, with pre-purchasers able to play on August 16.

On June 20, 2011, Paragon Studios announced that they were going to switch to a hybrid subscription model called &quot;City of Heroes: Freedom&quot;, adding in a free-to-play game model. Special models for former subscribers would be termed Premium Players, and current subscribers would become VIP players, who would gain access to all the content in the various upcoming game updates.

On August 31, 2012, Paragon Studios announced that it was being closed, and &quot;City of Heroes&quot; would cease all billing immediately and begin the process of shutting down the service. The stated explanation for this move was a &quot;realignment of company focus and publishing support&quot;. November 30, 2012, was listed as the official shutdown date of the game and the servers were turned off at midnight PST. Many players arrived en masse to express their continued protest, support, and fond farewells, including messages of gratitude from the developers and moderators thanking their fans for their support and passion for the game. A variety of efforts got underway, led by players of the game, to keep the game operating past the announced date of closure.

Missing Worlds Media&#x27;s president Nate Downes announced in September 2014 that he introduced an interest party who wanted to make a deal in reviving the game&#x27;s intellectual property with NCSoft staff, which might enable the final version of the game to be released. No additional info was released as the involved parties were under an NDA. The effort did not succeed, and the announcement has since been removed. This may have been due to the IP being used in Master X Master.

On April 15, 2019, news broke that a private server based on &quot;City of Heroes&quot; at the time of its shutdown had been running in secret for years. Three days later, source code relating to the server had been widely distributed, and a publicly accessible server based on the code was quickly spun up. While perceived threats, legal or otherwise, saw this server shut down by April 22, multiple public servers by various teams have since been set up based on the leaked code.

On January 4, 2024, the Homecoming fan server announced that it had worked out a deal with NCSoft and was now running an officially licensed instance of &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and its expansions, free to play and funded by donations.

==Gameplay==
City of Heroes required the creation of a character in order to enter the virtual world and progress through the game. After creating a character and selecting a name (the game would check if the name was already taken on the server), players could either begin play in an isolated tutorial zone, or skip the tutorial and begin in an open low-level zone. A character&#x27;s level increased by earning experience points from defeating foes, completing Missions, and exploring Zones, then returning to one of various named NPCs known as Trainers. Benefits for rising in level included more Health, more Powers to choose for the character, more slots to allocate Enhancements to Powers, and larger inventories for Inspirations (quick use items) and Salvage (crafting materials). If a player lost all of their Health they were temporarily considered defeated, at which point they could be revived through use of an item, by an ally&#x27;s powers, or by instant teleportation to Hospitals on the map. After reaching character level 10, a player defeat would accrue Experience Debt which temporarily made gaining additional experience more difficult.

The setting of the game, Paragon City for Heroes and The Rogue Isles for Villains, was divided into different Zones accessed through in-game transportation systems. Especially dangerous zones called &quot;Hazard&quot; or &quot;Trial&quot; zones, which teemed with larger groups of enemies, were marked in red on the in-game map and were much more dangerous than normal zones. The Villains&#x27; setting, the Rogue Isles, consisted of islands connected by a network of ferries and helicopters while the Heroes&#x27; setting, Paragon City consisted of regions separated by giant energy &quot;War Walls&quot; (which were justified in the back story) and were connected by direct access points and a Metropolitan Transport system styled on a light rail. A few zones were accessible to both heroes and villains; some were cooperative zones, while others were player versus player (PvP) zones. Praetoria, for characters created in the &quot;Going Rogue&quot; update, lacked War Walls, allowing more or less free movement between areas.

Players initially moved around the zones by jogging or using a minor speed-increasing power such as &quot;Sprint&quot;. As heroes grew in level and accumulated more powers, they could choose among four higher speed traveling powers: Teleportation, Super Speed, Super Jumping, and Flight.

As characters leveled-up, players could choose new powers from the character&#x27;s primary and secondary power sets, as set during creation, or from shared power pools. The power pools contained the four travel powers and other generic, usually utilitarian, powers that fell under categories such as Fitness, Concealment, and Leadership. In addition, as characters leveled up, they gained access to new costume features, including the ability to change between up to five costumes and unlockable costume parts such as capes and auras (unlocked after missions).

Quests in the game were known as missions, and were obtained through various channels, generally from various NPCs the player met in the game. Although missions could be completed alone, the player had the option to form Teams with other player characters to play off of each other&#x27;s characters&#x27; strengths and abilities. The level of the characters used, size of the team, and a separate difficulty scale chosen by the player called Notoriety, all affected the difficulty of the mission. Missions could take the form of an instanced area where the player(s) must defeat a boss, save NPC characters held hostage (sometimes taking the form of escort missions), or search the instance for a certain object or number of objects (such as clues or defusing bombs), while other Missions required that players defeat a certain number and type of mobs, possibly in a defined area of the game. Some missions are part of story arcs that involve the player in a larger narrative that tells some of the back story of the setting. Task Forces (&quot;City of Heroes&quot;), Strike Forces (&quot;City of Villains&quot;), and Trials (both) were particular missions that could be completed multiple times, but only as part of a team, and had to be completed in entirety to earn particular rewards for completion, such as the ability to respec a character&#x27;s chosen Powers and Enhancements.

Cooperative play also took the form of larger player-created clans called Supergroups, reminiscent of comic book groups such as the Justice League, the Avengers, or the Brotherhood of Mutants. Players part of Supergroups could team up together or convene in Bases (introduced with &quot;City of Villains&quot;). Bases were used for social meeting or housing special items used in crafting Inventions, serving as a collective item vault, or to recover after losing all Health in the overworld. Supergroups in turn could form Coalitions with each other for increased collaborations. Coalitions were generally formed for the raids featured in the game.

Another form of cooperative play was the Sidekick feature, which allowed for characters of disparate experience levels to participate in the game together. A Sidekick&#x27;s experience level would be temporarily risen to be close to their partner&#x27;s level, and their Health and strength would be scaled to their artificial level, while any experience or Influence they gained was scaled to their original level. A reverse feature known as Exemplar was added later, which artificially lowered the level of a higher level character (also removing access to powers unavailable at their new level), but they earn experience at their original level, which is useful in removing Debt, or gains Influence rather than Experience. For the release of &quot;City of Villains&quot;, these features are Lackey and Malefactor. Issue 16 overhauled the system such that it was automatically scaled to the &quot;Anchor&quot;, which was either the player on the team whose mission the team was set to perform or the team&#x27;s leader.

Players could also set &quot;leveling pacts&quot; which allowed two players to sync up the experience their characters gained, although this was disabled in a later update.

Other game features included auction houses and crafting inventions to make characters more powerful or unlock further costume options. The Architect release gave players the ability to construct custom mission arcs, with customized enemies and layouts that could then be played by all other players. The &quot;Going Rogue&quot; expansion allowed players to switch their alignment using Tip Missions collected from defeated enemies.

==Character creation==

In character creation, the player first selected a character&#x27;s origin and archetype, then primary and secondary power sets. Next, the actual avatar with its costume was created. Then the player had a choice of customizing the colors of his/her powers. Lastly, the player chose a name and could optionally write a background story to add some flavor to the character, as well as creating an individual battle cry.

There were five origins a player could choose for his/her character that dictated what type of enhancements the character may use, affected which single short-ranged power they begin with (in addition to powers obtained from their primary and secondary power sets), and influenced the various enemy groups that the character went up against. These origins were as follows:
*Natural: Powers obtained through training the body, weapons, or inherent abilities if the character is not human
*Magic: Powers obtained through a magic item, magical spells, or a mystical being
*Science: Powers obtained through some sort of scientific means, whether intentionally or accidentally
*Mutation: Powers obtained through a change in genetics, manifesting at any point in their life
*Technology: Powers obtained through highly advanced technology
A special &quot;Incarnate&quot; origin was programmed for various NPCs in the game who obtained powers from the fictional Well of the Furies. The &quot;Incarnate System&quot; added additional powers for the player to choose from after completing difficult missions.

There were five basic hero archetypes, which affected a character&#x27;s power choices and team role throughout the game. Blasters were versatile damage dealers, capable of fighting at short or long range against one or many opponents, but had relatively little health. Controllers were adept at preventing enemies from moving or acting through inducing status effects, as well as possessing pet summons. Defenders turned the tide of battle with weakening enemy attacks (debuffs) and ally-strengthening (buffs). Scrappers were melee fighters with a greater chance of critical hits against tough opponents such as bosses. Tankers possessed great defenses and the ability to take hits for the team, as well as powers to adjust aggro towards them.

There were also five basic villain archetypes. Brutes dealt increasing damage as they attacked or were themselves attacked. Corruptors could cause damage at range, with high chance for critical hits against wounded targets. Dominators assailed enemies with status effects and direct damage. Masterminds summoned, upgraded, and controlled combat pets. Stalkers were stealthy fighters, dealing critical hits when hidden or when accompanied by a team.

There were also two epic hero archetypes which were unlocked after reaching level 20 (level 50 prior to Issue 17) with another hero character. Peacebringers were peaceful symbiotic aliens that had light based powers. Warshades were war-like symbiotes that were normally enemies to the Peacebringers but had reformed their evil ways. Both archetypes were capable of shapeshifting into a more offensive or more defensive form. The villain side mirrored this, with two branching villain archetypes which were unlocked after reaching level 20 (also level 50 prior to Issue 17) with another villain character. Both are rank-and-file soldiers for the villainous group Arachnos (Soldiers and Widows) attempting to make a name for themselves, each with two distinct specializations.

With Issue 21, players could now create a character and go through a tutorial involving the destruction of Galaxy City by Shivans that allowed them to choose their alignment, such as a heroic Corruptor or a villainous Blaster. Heroes went to Paragon City, and Villains went to the Rogue Isles. Characters created with &quot;Going Rogue&quot; started the game in Praetoria, and chose whether to be a Loyalist, who followed Emperor Cole, or to be in the Resistance, who opposed him. In Praetoria, however, things were not so black and white. There were good and evil people on both sides, and, when leaving Praetoria at level 20, players could choose their character to be either a Hero or a Villain. The alignment could also be changed later on, allowing for Heroes to go Vigilante before becoming Villains or Villains to become Rogues before being redeemed as Heroes.

==Virtual rewards==

Similarly to other MMORPGs, &quot;City of Heroes/Villains&quot; had various items that were rewarded within the game. However, many of these items were described as intangible or other-worldly; such as &quot;inspirations&quot; (temporary power-ups) or &quot;inf&quot; (an abbreviation of &quot;influence&quot;, &quot;infamy&quot;, or &quot;information&quot;, for Heroes, Villains, and Praetorians, respectively, which was used instead of money), which were abstract ideas in the real world. &quot;Enhancements&quot; — slottable attribute boosts — also covered a range of ideas and items from magic enchantments to technological gadgets to training techniques. With the release of Issue 6, while in supergroup mode, a setting that could be toggled on and off, players accumulated prestige points which were used to improve the supergroup base.

Issue 9 brought the Invention system to the game, which allowed characters to combine other dropped items they salvaged and recipes to create various goods. Invented enhancements could provide better bonuses than normal enhancements, including set bonuses for slotting invented enhancements from the same set into the same power. Costume pieces and limited-use temporary powers could also be invented.

In addition to these, there were also collectible badges for players to earn. Gained for performing various actions in game (such as moving over specific places in each zone, defeating certain numbers of enemies, healing allies, and taking damage) most served no functional purpose for players, except to provide characters with tag lines under their character names. However, a few, called &quot;Accolades&quot; gave players access to temporary powers and permanent bonuses to health and endurance (the game&#x27;s equivalent to mana or magic points) and were gained by collecting other badges.

Players also had the option of purchasing a vast array items on the Paragon Market. Introduced with &quot;City of Heroes: Freedom&quot;, the Paragon Market was a cash shop wherein players could purchase, for example, power sets, costume sets, temporary powers and boosts, character renames and respecs, extra costume slots, and access to game content that to which they might not normally have access. The currency used on the Paragon Market was Paragon Points, which were either purchased with real money through the Market or awarded as bonuses for VIP subscribers.

==Enemies==

In &quot;City of Heroes&quot; there were multiple NPC groups that players fought as part of random encounters. Many enemies were found on the streets of Paragon City and the Rogue Isles, whereas others were found in specific instances or areas. There were also Giant Monsters and zone events that took place in parts of the city that were even more uncommon, such as Lusca the giant octopus in the waters of the Independence Port zone or the Ghost of Scrapyard that wanders through Sharkhead Isle. Enemies in instances were also graded with easier NPC&#x27;s at the start of the map and more difficult enemies towards the end of the instance.

==Setting==
The setting of &quot;City of Heroes&quot; is the fictional Paragon City, located in Rhode Island in the United States. 

Paragon City is divided into several smaller neighborhoods that had varying enemies and progressively higher levels of enemies within them. The arbitrary divisions between zones are explained in game by the presence of &quot;War Walls&quot;, powerful force fields derived from alien technology which were used to defend various areas of the city. Heroes set out by dealing with low-powered street gangs in the initial zones, working their way up to fighting increasingly dangerous threats — such as organized crime, corrupt corporations, hostile aliens, and supernatural terrors.

==Updates and history==

The Development Team continually expanded &quot;City of Heroes&quot; with free downloadable patches/updates as well as free game expansions dubbed &quot;Issues&quot;. All Issues were made available to both &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and (as of Issue 6) &quot;City of Villains&quot; titles throughout the lifespan of the game, improving features in both games with each release.

===Issues (free updates)===
===Expansions (paid updates)===

====&quot;City of Villains&quot;====
&quot;City of Villains&quot; was released in 2005 as a stand-alone expansion, an expansion that did not require the original &quot;City of Heroes&quot; purchase to work. It offered five new character archetypes that were, at the time, exclusive to Villain characters, new maps, and began the first PvP Zones (versus the Arena, which were instanced maps made for PvP fighting) of the game. &quot;City of Villains&quot; also was playable with the same subscription fee that paid for &quot;City of Heroes&quot; access after buying &quot;City of Villains&quot;. The retail box included four CD-ROMs for installation current to Issue 6, one of four limited edition HeroClix figures of the game&#x27;s villains, a poster of a map of the Rogue Isles, and a serial code that gave access to the game and one month of game play. Also included was a code for a 30-day trial for &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, as both games were currently separate. Since 2008, after the NCSoft acquisition of the intellectual properties, owning either &quot;City of Heroes&quot; or &quot;City of Villains&quot; unlocked both titles at no additional cost.

====&quot;Going Rogue&quot;====
&quot;City of Heroes: Going Rogue&quot; was released in 2010. Unlike &quot;City of Villains&quot;, &quot;Going Rogue&quot; was an expansion rather than a stand-alone expansion and required the original game to play. &quot;Going Rogue&quot; added an Alignment system, which allowed players to switch from Hero to Villain and added two intermediate Alignments: Vigilante, as a player progresses from Hero to Villain, and Rogue, as a player progresses from Villain to Hero. Players with Vigilante or Rogue characters had access to both &quot;City of Heroes&quot;″s Paragon City and &quot;City of Villains&quot;″s Rogue Isles until they change to Hero or Villain. The expansion also added the Praetorian Earth dimension where players could start out as neutrally-aligned Praetorians (choosing any of the ten basic Archetypes available to Heroes or Villains), either deciding to side with Emperor Cole&#x27;s ruling faction and become a Loyalist or side with the Resistance; the allegiance could change as the player chose and completed missions. Praetorian players could also attack new Neutral mobs and would eventually be able to play a mission that allowed them to choose to be a Hero or Villain and complete gameplay in the original games. &quot;Going Rogue&quot; also granted access to four new power sets, new costume sets and auras, and introduced missions that started after defeating mobs that affected the player&#x27;s Alignment.

===Retail releases and special editions===

*&quot;City of Heroes: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;: Sold through stores in 2005, this included an installation DVD-ROM that had game content up to Issue 4, a poster of a map of Paragon City, a &quot;CoH/PvP&quot; comic book, a Statesman HeroClix figure, and a serial code that added access to a special movement power, badge, and cape, in addition to access to the game and one month of game play. A special Hero Kit was later sold that allowed people to get all of the physical and digital content included in the &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; aside from the game installation disc.
*&quot;City of Villains: Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;: Sold in stores alongside the standard game edition, this pack included an installation DVD-ROM current through Issue 6, seven exclusive HeroClix figures of characters from both games, a book featuring concept art for both games, a promotional card for the City of Heroes Collectible Card Game, one of five preview decks for the CCG, a two-sided poster of the game map from the standard edition and a Heroes vs. Villains fight scene, a &quot;CoH&quot; trial serial code, and a serial code that allowed access to a special costume icon and cape, in addition to access to &quot;CoV&quot; and one month of game play.
*&quot;City of Heroes: Bootleg Edition&quot;: A trial copy of &quot;City of Heroes&quot; released free of charge as a promotional copy during City of Villains. The Bootleg Edition came with no special features, a 10-day demo key, and required a player to purchase a digital key for the &quot;City of Heroes&quot; or &quot;City of Villains&quot; game in order to play after the demo. Released during Issue 6, the disc allowed players to try either Heroes or Villains.
*&quot;City of Heroes &amp; City of Villains: Good Versus Evil Edition&quot;: This retail box included an installation DVD-ROM current to Issue 7, a two-sided map of Paragon City and the Rogue Isles, digital copies of issues 1 through 6 of Top Cow&#x27;s &quot;CoH&quot; comic book, and a &quot;Pocket D VIP Pass&quot; that had the serial code for access to both games, a month of free game play, special costume pieces for both Heroes and Villains, a special badge, and two special powers. This serial code was later made available digitally.
*&quot;City of Heroes: Architect Edition&quot;: This edition of the game included an installation DVD-ROM current to Issue 14 for both PC and Mac, a quick-start guide, the map from the &quot;Good Versus Evil Edition&quot;, and an activation code for the unified games, one month of free game play, and access to one of the first two Super Booster packs. A digital-only purchase later was made available for the same content.
*&quot;City of Heroes Going Rogue: Complete Collection&quot;: Released in 2010 alongside the standard version of the game, this edition includes &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, &quot;City of Villains&quot;, and adds access to unique in-game costume pieces, auras, emotes, and a unique invisibility power in addition to access to all of the content available with the standard &quot;Going Rogue&quot; game. Ordering this from GameStop included exclusive power enhancements.

===Booster packs===
Starting in 2008, &quot;Booster Packs&quot; were also released sporadically around Issue updates. Booster Packs did not function like expansions (adding content to the game), but rather added optional costume sets to the game&#x27;s character creator and user interface, and were available on the NCsoft Store for a one-time fee. Although each of these packs were themed after their similarly named character option in the game (so far character origins and power sets), their features could be applied to any or all the characters in a player&#x27;s account regardless of their actual origin, archetype or powers. There was also a &quot;Mini-Booster&quot; pack for the purchase of an in-game jetpack for 30 days of real time. 

As of August 30, 2011, Booster Packs were no longer available for sale on the NCSoft website. While costume pieces were still available in the Paragon Market under the Booster Pack names for one price, the prestige powers and emotes had been separated from the packs as an additional purchase.

===Super Packs===
On February 24, 2012, Heroes and Villains Super Packs were introduced to the Paragon Market after feedback from the beta release of the program was made known by the players.

===Virtual item packs===

A few in-game item packs were released to allow players to gain in-game items from select box releases of the game at a lower cost than repurchasing the title at retail price. Item packs only contained the items in an Edition release, and did not come with free playtime or (in the case of expansions) the added game content that require an expansion purchase in order to use.
*&quot;Good versus Evil Edition Item Pack&quot; which included a Jump Jet Travel Power, Pocket D Teleport power and special Hero/Villain-themed costume sets.
*&quot;Mac Special Edition Item Pack&quot;, which included all of the costume pieces from the Valkyrie set and the Mission Transporter power.
*&quot;Going Rogue Item Pack&quot;, which included the Alpha and Omega costume sets and the Shadowy Presence power.
*&quot;Wedding Pack&quot;: A serial code first sold on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 2008, added special wedding-themed costume pieces and emotes to the game.
*&quot;Party Pack&quot;: Released in late September, 2010, which included party themed character emotes.
As of August 30, 2011 virtual item packs were no longer available for sale on the NCSoft website. The individual costume pieces and powers were available through the in-game store.

===Holiday events===
The &quot;City of Heroes&quot; development team also initiated events based on North American and European holidays and observances, starting with Halloween in 2004, followed by a Winter Event in 2005, and finally a Valentine&#x27;s Day event in 2006.

===Anniversary===
&quot;City of Heroes&quot; granted a commemorative badge during its anniversary month of May and often scheduled special events and surprises during May. On the game&#x27;s fifth anniversary on April 28, 2009, and on the same day during the sixth anniversary for 2010, an outbreak of Giant Monsters of every type was released throughout the game in all zones for players to defeat within a 24-hour span.

===&quot;City of Hero&quot;===
A Korean open beta of &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, entitled &quot;City of Hero&quot; (, &quot;Siti Obeu Hieoro&quot;), was launched on January 18, 2006. However, the game&#x27;s official release was cancelled. The Korean &quot;CoH&quot; team directed its players to a coupon for an account on the US servers as compensation.

==Servers==
&quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot; employed several servers. The servers were divided between the North American and European markets, with separate European servers with language localization for German and French speakers. The North American servers were based in Dallas, Texas, while the European servers were moved from Germany to a new site in the US in November 2010.

==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;City of Heroes&quot; sold 330,000 copies ($13.8 million) by August 2006, after its release in April 2004. It was the country&#x27;s 53rd best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006.

In 2004, Computer Gaming World hailed the game, saying, &quot;&quot;City of Heroes&quot; blows a superpowered gust of fresh air into an increasingly stale sword-and-sorcery MMO world.&quot;

In 2009, IGN, The Escapist, and Allakhazam praised &quot;City of Heroes: Architect Edition&quot;, which added the ability to create missions.

The game received additional praise because the characters of inactive players were not deleted, even if the player&#x27;s subscription had been canceled or inactive for an extended period of time. In anticipation of the release of &quot;City of Villains&quot;, Cryptic announced on October 10, 2005, that effective October 24, 2005, characters below level 35 on accounts that had been unpaid and inactive for more than ninety days would have their names flagged as unreserved allowing new users to take the name. The character itself was left untouched, and a player who lost his character&#x27;s name was given the option to choose a new one. This policy was suspended on May 4, 2006, because Cryptic&#x27;s data-mining had shown that very few names were being taken in this fashion anymore; Cryptic said thirty days&#x27; notice would be given prior to future changes to the name policy. On July 31, 2007, Cryptic announced that the name policy would go back into effect as of August 29, 2007, but would apply only to characters under level 6.

=== Awards ===
&quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;City of Heroes&quot; the ninth-best computer game of 2004. The editors wrote, &quot;In a genre dominated by games that try to be all things to all people and end up doing nothing particularly well, it&#x27;s particularly refreshing.&quot; It received runner-up placements in &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s 2004 &quot;Best Massively Multiplayer Online Game&quot; and &quot;Most Surprisingly Good Game&quot; award categories. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;City of Heroes&quot; for &quot;Computer Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Massively Multiplayer/Persistent World Game of the Year&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Achievement in Game Design&quot;. At the following year&#x27;s awards ceremony, the expansion &quot;City of Villains&quot; won the &quot;Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year&quot; award outright (tied with &quot;Guild Wars&quot;).

==Subscription==
As in most other MMORPGs at the time, players were required to subscribe to &quot;City of Heroes&quot; by paying the publisher (NCsoft) a monthly fee to continue playing &quot;City of Heroes&quot;. Portions of the subscription costs went to supporting a full-time &quot;live&quot; team, which developed additional content for the game; other portions supported the significant server maintenance and bandwidth costs.

Continuing active subscriptions were also entitled to &quot;Veteran Rewards&quot;. The system rewarded players with costume pieces, extra powers, supergroup base items, respec opportunities, and other minor in-game perks to all characters (both hero and villain characters) on any server tied to the active subscription. Inactive accounts did not accrue time for Veteran Rewards.

As of September, 2008, &quot;City of Heroes&quot; had around 124,939 subscribers in the US &amp; Europe, according to financial reports released by NCsoft in November 2008.

On June 20, 2011, &quot;City of Heroes&quot; announced the &quot;City of Heroes: Freedom&quot; subscription model, which was implemented in September, 2011. The servers were free-to-play, with limitations on what Free players could access. Players who had their subscriptions lapse would become Premium players, and would have access to everything they used to have, but would be limited to what they would be able to access in the game&#x27;s future updates unless they signed up for a VIP subscription. The VIP subscription added free access to the &quot;Going Rogue&quot; game content, and a monthly VIP Rewards system (as opposed to the quarterly releases of the Veteran Rewards). There was also an in-game market where all players could purchase points to purchase expansions to the game; VIP subscribers were given a monthly stipend of these points at no extra charge.

==Other media==
===Novels===

The first &quot;City of Heroes&quot; novel, &quot;The Web of Arachnos&quot;, by Robert Weinberg, was published by CDS Books (an imprint of the Perseus Publishing Group) in October, 2005. The novel chronicles the back stories of the Statesman and Lord Recluse, the central iconic characters in the &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot; franchises. A second novel, &quot;The Freedom Phalanx&quot;, written by Robin Laws, was released in May, 2006, and detailed the re-formation of the hero team the Freedom Phalanx in the 1980s. The story centers on the fledgling heroes Positron and Synapse, but also includes Manticore, Sister Psyche, and Statesman. The book&#x27;s villains include Lord Recluse, Doctor Null, Shadow Queen, and Revenant. Artist George Pérez provided the covers for the first two novels, as well as lending his name to one of the early areas of the game itself, Perez Park. A third novel titled &quot;The Rikti War&quot; was announced by CDS at the time the first novel was published, with an August 2006, scheduled release date. The book was reportedly going to cover the epic trans-dimensional war between Earth and the Rikti home world, however the book was later cancelled. James Lowder served as editor and packager of the City of Heroes novels for CDS.

===Comic books===
To tie in with the game, NCsoft released two original comic book series that featured various characters from within the games themselves. The original series by publisher Blue King featured the heroes/roommates Apex and War Witch with their neighbor Horus. The later series from publisher Top Cow featured signature heroes and villains from both &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot; such as Statesman, Positron, Lord Recluse, and Ghost Widow, along with scripts by well-known comic book creators Mark Waid, Troy Hickman, and Dan Jurgens. Both series were originally free for subscribers to the games, but later they were provided for an extra subscription fee with the game and for free in digital format afterwards on the official &quot;City of Heroes&quot; website. The Blue King series ran for 12 issues, after which the Top Cow series ran for an additional 20 issues, ending in July 2007.

===Collectible card game===
Alderac Entertainment Group also worked with &quot;CoH&quot; to create a collectible card game featuring characters from the game, as well as several original characters. The game&#x27;s website also allowed players to create a game-compliant card for their own online character.

===Role-playing game===
The &quot;City of Heroes&quot; team worked with Eden Studios, Inc. to create a tabletop role-playing game based on the game. While a free preview version of the game was released, the game was indefinitely delayed due to the cancellation license with Fox on their &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; role-playing games. Eden owner George Vasilakos later made a statement in 2008 that they were waiting on information from the copyright holders, but no news arose after this date.&lt;ref name=&quot;forum post 02/21/200&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroclix===

The various collector&#x27;s editions of &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot; included exclusive HeroClix figures of signature characters from the game. These included Statesman (without a cape), Manticore, Ghost Widow, Lord Recluse, Positron, Black Scorpion and Mako. There was also a separate, Limited Edition version of Statesman wearing a cape.

===Film and television===
In June 2007, it was announced that the producer for the &quot;Transformers&quot; film, Tom DeSanto, had acquired the option to make movies and television shows based on the &quot;City of Heroes&quot; franchise. In February 2008, it was announced that DeSanto had indeed begun preparations for the film. A plot summary had been released detailing that the movie itself takes place during the first Rikti War.

==Lawsuit==
In November 2004, Marvel Comics filed a lawsuit against &quot;City of Heroes&quot; developer Cryptic Studios, publisher NCsoft, and game administrator NC Interactive (NCI), alleging that the game not only allowed, but actively promoted, the creation of characters who infringe copyrights and trademarks owned by Marvel. The suit sought unspecified damages and an injunction halting further sales and shutting down the game.

The game included in its user agreement strong language against such activity, however. It forbade the creation of potentially infringing characters, and NCI had been known to rename or &quot;genericize&quot; such characters. The User Agreement additionally held players accountable to indemnify (reimburse) NCI and its affiliates against third-party infringement claims, and demanded either a granting of sole ownership in player created content, including characters, to NCI, or a warranty that a third party owner of the rights in player created content had made such a grant. 

Marvel subsequently admitted that some of the allegedly infringing characters cited in the complaint had been created by Marvel&#x27;s own investigators. In March 2005, the court struck those exhibits from the complaint. The court also dismissed with prejudice some of Marvel&#x27;s claims. The dismissed claims included all indirect trademark infringement counts, because Marvel had not pleaded commercial use of Marvel&#x27;s marks by the game&#x27;s players. Commercial use is a required element of infringement under American trademark statutes.

On December 12, 2005, all remaining claims were settled under undisclosed terms. The game&#x27;s operators asserted that the settlement did not require changes to the character creation engine.

Despite the litigation, in October 2006, Marvel Comics selected Cryptic Studios to develop its own superhero MMORPG for Windows Vista and Xbox Live, titled &quot;Marvel Universe Online&quot;. The alliance surprised players, but developer Matt &quot;Positron&quot; Miller assured fans on Cryptic&#x27;s official website that development and maintenance would continue separately on both games, proved later by the complete split between &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and Cryptic Studios. Marvel Universe Online was eventually cancelled by Microsoft.

==Acquisition and new studio==
On November 6, 2007, NCsoft announced that it would assume ownership of both &quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot;. As part of a push to further develop &quot;City of Heroes&quot;, the company also announced the formation of a new development studio dedicated to new titles as well as their interest in distributing and administering their future works once launched. This new team was centered on key members of the Cryptic and NCsoft &quot;City of Heroes/Villains&quot; teams who accepted the NCsoft offer to join their new studio in Northern California. The sale of the City of Heroes IP granted Cryptic Studios the freedom to work on its new superhero MMORPG (at this time, an RPG/Action hybrid) &quot;Champions Online&quot; without concerns of conflict of interest.

Shortly after having acquired full ownership of the property, NCsoft granted all existing and former &quot;City of Heroes&quot; account holders access to both games (&quot;City of Heroes&quot; and &quot;City of Villains&quot;).

<doc id="617348" wikidata="Q234071" url="?curid=617348" title="Pam Ferris">
<text>Pamela Ferris (born 11 May 1948) is a Welsh actress. She has starred in numerous British television series, including &quot;Connie&quot; (1985), &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; (1991–1993), &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; (1997–2000), &quot;Rosemary &amp; Thyme&quot; (2003–2006), and &quot;Call the Midwife&quot; (2012–2016). For her role as Peggy Snow in &quot;Where the Heart Is,&quot; Ferris was nominated three times for Most Popular Actress at the National Television Awards. Ferris is best known to younger audiences for her role as Miss Agatha Trunchbull in the film &quot;Matilda&quot; (1996).

Ferris also portrayed Marge Dursley in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; (2004), Miriam in &quot;Children of Men&quot; (2006), Mrs. Bevan in &quot;Nativity!&quot; (2009) and &quot;Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger&quot; (2012), voiced Mrs. Bennett / Aunty Betty in &quot;Ethel &amp; Ernest&quot; (2016) and played Mrs. Faulkner in &quot;Tolkien&quot; (2019).

In theatre, her performance as Phoebe Rice in &quot;The Entertainer&quot; at The Old Vic in London saw her nominated for the 2007 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role.

==Early life==
Ferris was born on 11 May 1948 in Hanover, Lower Saxony, Germany, to a Welsh mother and an English father who was serving in the Royal Air Force. After her parents returned to the United Kingdom, Ferris spent her childhood in the Aberkenfig area, near Bridgend in Wales. Her father, Fred Ferris, was a policeman, and her mother, Ann Perkins, worked in her family&#x27;s bakery business.

==Career==
Ferris performed in her younger years at the Mercury Theatre in Auckland, and later with various regional companies in the UK. She played motherly Ma Larkin in the ITV series &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot;, which ran from 1991 to 1993. She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1991, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel while recording an episode of &quot;The Darling Buds of May&quot; at Yorkshire Television in Leeds. She has also acted in a succession of television dramas, including &quot;Meantime&quot;, in which she played the Cockney mother of Phil Daniels and Tim Roth, &quot;Connie&quot;, &quot;Hardwicke House&quot;, &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot;, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, and &quot;Paradise Heights&quot;. From 2003 to 2006, she played the gardening sleuth Laura Thyme in &quot;Rosemary &amp; Thyme&quot;, starring opposite Felicity Kendal.

Her roles in costume dramas include parts in television adaptations of &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot;, &quot;Pollyanna&quot;, and &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

In 1996, Ferris portrayed the brutish, authoritarian school headmistress Miss Agatha Trunchbull in &quot;Matilda&quot; (a role played by male actors in the stage musical version).

In 2004, she played the foul-mouthed Marge Dursley in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. In 2006, Ferris took on the role of Miriam, a motherly British activist, in &quot;Children of Men&quot;. She voiced Mrs. Bennett/Aunty Betty in the animated biographical film &quot;Ethel &amp; Ernest&quot;, which was broadcast on BBC One on 26 December 2016, and played Mrs. Faulkner in &quot;Tolkien&quot; (2019). She has also acted in productions for BBC Radio 4.

Her career in the theatre has included parts in Royal Court Theatre and National Theatre productions. In 2007, she played Phoebe Rice in a revival of John Osborne&#x27;s&quot; The Entertainer&quot; at London&#x27;s Old Vic Theatre. In 2007, Ferris took part in the BBC Wales programme &quot;Coming Home&quot; about her Welsh family history. In 2008, she played Mrs. General in a BBC adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;. From 2009 to 2010, she appeared in the final series of the BBC comedy &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot; as Cath Smith. In 2010, she made a guest appearance in the sitcom &quot;Grandma&#x27;s House&quot;. From 2012 to 2016, Ferris played the part of Sister Evangelina in the series &quot;Call the Midwife&quot;. In June and July 2015, Ferris was the guest of Sarah Walker on BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Essential Classics&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Ferris married actor Roger Frost. She lives in Elham, Kent, England. In a 2012 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; Ferris said, &quot;I was obsessed with work in my youth. It&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t get married until I was 38 and the reason I didn&#x27;t have kids. Not having children isn&#x27;t a sadness in my life, though. I know I wouldn&#x27;t have been a half-bad mother, but that&#x27;s what happened. There&#x27;s no regretting it.&quot;

<doc id="617353" wikidata="Q2607585" url="?curid=617353" title="Édouard Ménétries">
<text>Édouard Ménétries (Paris, France, 2 October 1802 – St. Petersburg, Imperial Russia, 10 April 1861) was a French entomologist, zoologist, and herpetologist. He is best known as the founder of the Russian Entomological Society.

Ménétries was born in Paris, and became a student of Georges Cuvier and Pierre André Latreille. On their recommendation he was chosen as the zoologist on a Russian expedition to Brazil in 1822, led by Baron von Langsdorff. On his return he was appointed curator of the Zoological Collection at St Petersburg. In 1829 he was sent by the Tsar on an exploratory trip to the Caucasus.

Ménétries was an authority on Lepidoptera and Coleoptera but also worked on other orders. Most of his named species are from Russia and Siberia but at the museum he was able to study insects from other parts of the world. Two such collections were those made during the expeditions of Alexander von Middendorf (1842–1845) and Leopold von Schrenck (1853–1857) to California and Alaska as well as Siberia. His collection is in the Museum of the St. Petersburg Academy.

In the field of herpetology he described several new species of reptiles and amphibians.

==Biography==

===His first steps===
Menetries, was born in Paris. In his youth he was a student of Georges Cuvier and a &quot;father of entomology&quot; Pierre André Latreille. On their recommendation he participated in 1821–1825 in the expedition of the Russian Academician G.I. Langsdorff to Brazil where he acquired vast experience of field research and wrote a number of papers on zoology. After returning from Brazil he was invited to St Petersburg, where he arrived in 1826 and was enrolled on the staff of the Kunstkammer in the position of curator of the zoological collections. He was provided an apartment at government expense and a salary of 2500 roubles per year.

===Expedition to the Caucasus===
In Russia his first and longest trip in 1829–1830 was to the Caucasus, which was not pacified yet. That academic expedition was organized on the initiative of General Emmanuel, member of the Academy, who was the army commander in the Caucasus. The expedition included physicist A.Ya. Kupfer, geographer E.F. Lents and botanist K.A. Meyer. Menetries was in charge of the zoological part. Through Moscow, Rostov, and Stavropol participants of the expedition arrived at the fortification Kamennyi Most on the Malka River, where the staff of General Emmanuel was situated.

Emmanuel with his son and several more people joined them. Under the protection of 650 soldiers, 350 Cossacks and two cannons, the party moved to Elbrus and made a camp at the foot of the mountain. On 9(21) July two days of climbing of Elbrus were undertaken. On the first day the explorers reached the boundary of eternal snow and spent the night there. On the second day they started storming the peak.

They did not succeed in climbing it. When they reached an altitude of 4700 m the sun had risen and the snow cover partly melted, which made further expedition impossible. Only one guide, Kabardian Kilar Khashirov, reached the peak. Then for one month the expedition examined the Elbrus area, collecting great quantities of scientific material. Afterwards they returned to Pyatigorsk. There the participants received academic instruction according to which Lenz, Meier, and Menetries were to continue their trip for studying the Caspian coast up to the Persian boundary.

At the end of August they left Pyatigorsk and arrived in fortress Groznaya (now Grozny) and from there departed at the end of October with a Cossack escort to Khasavyurt, crossed Sulak, travelled to the Caspian coast through Derbent and Kuba, and arrived in Baku on 9(21) December. In winter they examined mud volcanoes and discharges of oil and gas in the Apsheron Peninsula. On 27 April (9 May) Menetries and Meier moved from Baku southwards through Salyany, the southern part of Mugan steppe, and the coast of Kyzyl-Agach Bay. After 20 days they arrived in Lenkoran.

They examined lowland and foothill forests with extremely interesting fauna and flora and then made a month-long trip to the mountains near Zuvand Depression, where they collected abundant entomological materials. When they returned to Lenkoran at the end of June, a cholera epidemic raged through the city and they quickly moved to Baku and then to Kuba from where they climbed the slopes of the mountains Shahdagh and Beshbarmak up to the subalpine zone. In Kuba they encountered a cholera epidemic again. They moved to Pyatigorsk and departed from there in the middle of October. But because of impassable roads and cholera quarantines they returned to St. Petersburg at the end of December.

In 1831 Menetries published &quot;The Annotated Catalogue of Zoological Objects Collected during the Journey to the Caucasus to the Boundaries with Persia&quot;. That first large scientific work dealing with the Caucasian fauna contained descriptions of several hundred species of Caucasian insects, mainly beetles and butterflies; up till the present it retains its significance as a source of study of animals of the Caucasus.

===Curator for the Zoological Museum===
In St. Petersburg, Menetries, as the new curator. began reorganizing the collections. Before then the method of setting collections in the Kunstkammer was totally unscientific.

The collections were exhibited in cases with glass covers grouped in such a way that a large and colourful insect, a butterfly or a beetle was placed in the centre and different species were arranged around it radially, symmetrically where possible. At the centre, each radius began with a small insect which was followed by larger insects so that the case was filled completely. Set in such a manner the collection had no scientific value, since even orders were mixed in a quaint way, reflecting the aesthetic ideas of the person who assembled the collection.

No labels with identifications of insects were applied: information about their origin was usually missing. Menetries divided the collection by order, identified the material where possible and arranged the collection in systematic order. A large portion of material that had no labels, and suffered from pests and mould, was disposed of. When the Zoological Museum of the Academy of Sciences was officially opened in 1832 Menetries was designated Curator of its entomological collections. He held that position up to the end of his life.

The new collection at the Zoological Museum was based upon specimens collected by Menetries in Brazil, in the Caucasus. Later the rich collection of Arvid David Hummel that consisted mostly of insects from St. Petersburg province, and a small but interesting collection from the vicinity of Irkutsk, were added to the museum. It was not easy for Menetries to live and work. His salary was growing slower than the cost of living and it was hardly possible to maintain his family with that salary. Menetries earned additional money by teaching classes at the Smolny Institute (a college for girls of noble origin) and other colleges.

In 1855 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences, but at that time it provided no advantage in terms of material well-being, and he didn&#x27;t even have an assistant at the museum. In the 1830s through the 1850s vast zoological collections were received by the museum from different regions of the Russian Empire, including Russian America, and through collection exchanges with foreign Museums, but there weren&#x27;t enough cabinets and cases. Under such difficult conditions Menetries had done a lot primarily on beetles and butterflies.

He studied fauna of European Russia and of Siberia; published one of the first works on fauna of Kazakhstan based on the collections of the famous traveller S. Karelin (great grandfather of the poet Alexander Blok). He examined collections of A. Leman, a doctor and naturalist who was sent on a Russian political mission to Khiva and Bukhara (nearly unstudied at that time), and who died on the way back from Central Asia.

Thus, foundations of knowledge on entomofauna of these areas were laid and collections were established on which this knowledge rested. In order to cope with the huge amount of technical work and to have time for investigations Menetries sought the assistance of a small group of St. Petersburg amateurs in entomology (primarily butterfly and beetle collectors).

They prepared and labeled insects that were included into the collection. For that service they received duplicate specimens. Negative aspects of this practice very soon became apparent. Some amateurs took advantage of Menetries&#x27; reliance. A particularly negative role was played by V.I. Motschulsky starting in the mid-1850s. This very energetic man, colonel of the General Staff, owner of a huge collection and author of numerous works on systematics of beetles and some on other insects suggested that he would identify and bring into order the Coleoptera collection.

He then handled the collection of the Museum as if it had been his own: he took home whole parcels of material, kept the most interesting specimens, used duplicates for exchange purposes, and returned to the museum only what was left. His example was followed by other collectors who examined Hymenoptera, Heteroptera and other groups.

At the end of his life Menetries studied mostly butterflies, which are therefore in a better state of preservation than other insect orders. When he died at the beginning of 1861 his successor, A.F. Moravits, had to make much effort to bring the collection into order and regulate access to it. Relations with Motschulsky were ended. He brought his collection to Moscow; after his death the collection was deposited at the Zoological Museum of the Moscow University.

===Creation of the Russian Entomological Society===
The circle of amateur entomologists around Menetries had played a positive role in the development of entomology in Russia. It was the core of the Russian (from 1930 through 1992 All-Union) Entomological Society. The first project of the society arose in the beginning of 1848, but as has been stated in the paper commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Society (1910). &quot;For circumstances of that time not only was the fulfillment of that idea to be postponed, but even private meetings were to be ceased&quot;.

This happened because Nicholas I, frightened by the revolutionary movement of 1848 in Europe, was afraid of even scientific societies and meetings. It was not until after his death that movement for the organization of the society was started at the reign of Alexander II, who was more liberal, and with the assistance of intelligent and well-educated grand princess Elena Pavlovna, widow of Mikhail Pavlovich, uncle of Alexander II.

In 1859 permission was granted. The organizing meeting of the Russian Entomological Society took place on 25 February 1860 in the large official apartment of general K. Manderstern, Superintendent of the Peter-and-Paul Fortress. His son, colonel of the Guards, was among the organizers of the society. The meeting was attended by 30 people including Academicians Johann Friedrich von Brandt, Karl Ernst von Baer (elected the first President of the Russian Entomological Society) and Alexander von Middendorff the famous explorer and researcher of Siberia. Seven founders of the society were officers. Menetries, who was seriously ill, could not attend the meeting. He died a year later on 10 April 1861. His contribution in the development of entomology in Russia should not be forgotten.

<doc id="617354" wikidata="Q1503015" url="?curid=617354" title="Thrice">
<text>Thrice is an American rock band from Irvine, California, formed in 1998. The group was founded by guitarist/vocalist Dustin Kensrue and lead guitarist Teppei Teranishi while they were in high school.

Early in their career, the band was known for melodic hardcore punk music based in heavily distorted guitars, prominent lead guitar lines, and frequent changes in complex time signatures. This style is exemplified on their second album, &quot;The Illusion of Safety&quot; (2002) and their third album &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot; (2003). Their fourth album &quot;Vheissu&quot; (2005) made significant changes by incorporating electronic beats, keyboards, and a more experimental sound. In 2007 and 2008, Thrice released &quot;The Alchemy Index&quot;, consisting of two studio albums that together make a four-part, 24-song cycle. Each of the four six-song EPs of the Alchemy Index features significantly different styles, based on different aspects of the band&#x27;s musical esthetic which reflect the elemental themes of fire, water, air and earth, both lyrically and musically. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Beggars,&quot; was released on August 11, 2009, and their eighth, &quot;Major/Minor&quot; on September 20, 2011. The most recent albums feature a refined combination of the band&#x27;s different experiments and explorations. In 2011, Thrice announced a final tour and an imminent hiatus.

Kensrue and Teranishi decided to reform the band in 2015 after attending a Brand New concert. In 2016, Thrice released their first post-reunion album, &quot;To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere.&quot; 
The band&#x27;s tenth album, &quot;Palms&quot;, was released in 2018. Their eleventh studio album &quot;Horizons/East&quot; was released in September 2021. Each album released by Thrice has had a portion of its sales proceeds donated to a new charitable organization.

==History==

===&quot;First Impressions&quot; and &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; (1998–2001)===

Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi knew each other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11. Teppei recruited his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided to go with the name &#x27;Thrice&#x27; out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, and they were going to use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.

In 1999, the band self-released an EP, &quot;First Impressions&quot;, which was the product of a two-day session at A-Room Studios with Brian Tochilin. Only 1,000 copies were made and the band members sold them out of their cars. Working with Death by Stereo&#x27;s Paul Miner, the quartet recorded twelve tracks, and by April 2000, the group had released &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; on Greenflag Records. A portion of the album&#x27;s proceeds were donated to a local charity called Crittenton Services for Children and Families. More support gigs and local buzz followed, and Thrice sparked the interest of Hopeless/Sub City&#x27;s Louis Posen. In 2001, Posen signed with the band, reissued &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, and sent the group out on tour with Samiam. Tours with Midtown and Hot Rod Circuit followed.

===&quot;The Illusion of Safety&quot; (2002)===

Thrice re-entered the studio with producer Brian McTernan to record its Hopeless/Sub City debut, &quot;The Illusion of Safety&quot;. The album was released in February 2002. The band toured extensively to support it, opening for Further Seems Forever and Face to Face before embarking on its first headlining tour later that year. The band again donated a portion of the album&#x27;s proceeds, this time choosing a non-profit youth shelter in South Central Los Angeles, A Place Called Home. The band&#x27;s donations were matched by their label.

The album received generally positive reviews and garnered the attention of several major labels. The band eventually signed with Island Records, who had agreed to match Thrice&#x27;s charitable donations in the same manner that Hopeless/Sub City had. That fall, the band toured with Hot Water Music and Coheed and Cambria before returning to the studio.

===&quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot; (2003–2004)===

The band re-entered the studio in March and April 2003. On July 22, 2003, the band released its Island Records debut, &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot;. The album was again produced by Brian McTernan. The album&#x27;s title is in reference to &quot;Burn Collector&quot; by Al Burian and is meant to reflect the band&#x27;s desire to do more than make music and contribute to society through their charitable donations. A portion of the album&#x27;s proceeds were this time donated to the Syrentha Savio Endowment, a financial aid organization for breast cancer patients. First pressings of the album were packaged in a digipak-style case with postcards containing lyrics and notes from the band.

The album spawned three singles: &quot;All That&#x27;s Left&quot;, &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot;, and &quot;Stare at the Sun.&quot; &quot;All That&#x27;s Left&quot; received significant airplay, and Thrice found themselves playing at larger venues as the year progressed. In addition to returning to the Warped Tour for its 2003 iteration around the time of album&#x27;s release, a co-headlining fall tour with labelmates Thursday and opener Coheed and Cambria sold out across the United States, as well as a stint on the Honda Civic Tour with Dashboard Confessional, The Get Up Kids, and Hot Water Music.

Throughout 2004, the band continued to tour in support of &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot;. Island Records issued a promotional disc (that features an alternate version of &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot;) in early 2004 that would become the basis for &quot;If We Could Only See Us Now&quot;, a CD/DVD package outlining the group&#x27;s career. Named after a lyric from &quot;So Strange I Remember You,&quot; the CD portion contained live tracks from a performance at the Apple Store and various B-sides. A slot to promote the CD/DVD came on the 2004 Warped Tour, their third time playing the tour.

===&quot;Vheissu&quot; (2005–2006)===
Thrice spent much of the first half of 2005 working with producer Steve Osborne on the follow-up to &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot;. Thrice released &quot;Vheissu&quot; on October 18, 2005, with &quot;Image of the Invisible&quot; as the first single. The album&#x27;s title was taken from the Thomas Pynchon novel &quot;V.&quot;, and featured a wider variety of instrumentation than used in the band&#x27;s previous albums, including the use of strings, electronics, and a Rhodes Piano. Many of the album&#x27;s lyrics also feature biblical, spiritual, and abstract themes.

For the band&#x27;s donations related to this album&#x27;s sales proceeds, Thrice chose novelist Dave Eggers&#x27;s charity 826 Valencia, a tutorial program for underprivileged children, which promotes literacy and aids teens in developing creative writing skills. In return, Eggers created the cover art for &quot;Vheissu&quot;.

The band toured extensively in support of the album, including headlining the 2006 Taste of Chaos tour and performing &quot;Image of the Invisible&quot; on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In April 2006, the band released &quot;Red Sky&quot; as the second single from the album. The accompanying video was directed by Tim Hope, who had previously directed videos for Coldplay and Jimmy Eat World. Instead of releasing just a single, Thrice opted to release the &quot;Red Sky EP&quot; in support of the single, which included two previously unreleased tracks and four live tracks.

===&quot;The Alchemy Index&quot; (2006–2008)===

In September 2006, the band announced plans for a new album (later titled &quot;The Alchemy Index&quot;) on their official website. The album was conceived as a series of 4 EPs, each of which represents an element of nature: fire, water, air, and earth. The band maintained a studio blog &quot;Alchemy Index&quot; throughout the recording process.

During the recording process, the band announced that they were leaving Island Records, citing a difference of opinion on the band&#x27;s future direction as the reason for the split. The band joined Vagrant Records on August 9, 2007.

On October 12, 2007, Thrice released the first two songs from the &quot;Alchemy Index&quot; in their entirety through the band&#x27;s MySpace page. &quot;The Alchemy Index Vols. I &amp; II&quot; was released on October 16, 2007, and sold 28,000 copies in its first week. It debuted at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and it topped at number five on the iTunes top-selling albums. To promote the new album, Thrice toured with the bands MewithoutYou and Brand New, and followed with a series of Canadian shows with bands Say Anything and Attack in Black. The second half of the project, &quot;The Alchemy Index Vols. III &amp; IV - Earth &amp; Air&quot;, was released on April 15, 2008.

The final song on each disc is written in the form of a sonnet, depicting the relationship of man with each of the particular elements. Each of these songs is in iambic pentameter, with a concluding rhyming couplet. These final couplets also contain the same vocal melody and chord progression as each other, although they are in different keys.

Thrice toured with Circa Survive and Pelican in spring 2008 to support The Alchemy Index, which had now been released in full. The third-to-last show of this tour—the May 28, 2008, show at the House of Blues in Anaheim—was filmed for a live CD/DVD &quot;Live at the House of Blues&quot;. The live album spans 2 CDs and a DVD with live footage and an exclusive interview in which the band answers fan-submitted questions. In fall 2008, they embarked on a tour supporting Rise Against, along with Alkaline Trio and The Gaslight Anthem.

===&quot;Beggars&quot; (2009–2010)===

On January 4, 2009, the band announced on its website that writing had begun for the follow-up to &quot;The Alchemy Index&quot;, with the title announced as &quot;Beggars&quot; on June 15, 2009. A July update to the band&#x27;s website revealed the release date to be October 13, 2009. However, after the album was leaked several months in advance, the band announced on their website on July 23, 2009, that the album would be released exclusively to iTunes on August 11. The physical CD was released on September 15, 2009. Bonus content included two b-sides from the Beggars sessions, two remixes, and a studio rendition of their cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.

Feeling that the band&#x27;s previous two projects (&quot;The Alchemy Index&quot; and &quot;Vheissu&quot;) had a &quot;sleepy feeling&quot; to them, Thrice wanted to make a record that was &quot;a little more upbeat and energetic.&quot; Thrice&#x27;s members also hoped to save money and spend more time with their families by building a recording studio in guitarist Teppei Teranishi&#x27;s home. Originally, the band expressed interest in tracking the record live (i.e. recording the full band all at once, instead of each instrument individually and mixing together at a later time) in the home studio; however Thrice later abandoned the idea of recording this way. Instead, the band recorded songs with &quot;similar vibe[s] musically, and tonally&quot; in the same session. Several wooden devices were constructed by the band for the home studio to make the recordings &quot;sound better.&quot; The self-produced album was released through Vagrant Records.

Thrice played The Bamboozle Left festival in April, and played selected dates on the summer&#x27;s Warped Tour. Throughout the Warped Tour shows, Thrice played &quot;All the World is Mad,&quot; &quot;At the Last&quot; and &quot;The Weight.&quot;

The song &quot;All the World is Mad&quot; is featured in the Vagrant Song Pack for Guitar Hero, which was released on July 23, 2009. &quot;Deadbolt&quot; appears on &quot;Guitar Hero 5&quot;.

In 2009, it was announced that the band would serve as openers for Brand New for their Fall North American tour. Multiple shows were sold out, and the band notably performed a cover of The Beatles&#x27;s &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;. After this leg of the tour, Thrice began a tour with The Dear Hunter, but they had to play without guitarist Teppei Teranishi who left due to a family emergency.

In 2009, while on the Vans Warped Tour in Houston, Texas, the band autographed a Gibson Guitar for the non-profit Music Saves Lives and assisted in their goal of raising the nation&#x27;s blood supply.

Thrice posted a poll for fans to vote for which song from &quot;Beggars&quot; to use for a music video. &quot;All the World is Mad&quot;, &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;In Exile&quot; were the choices for the poll, with &quot;In Exile&quot; narrowly beating &quot;The Weight&quot; even after some voters hacked into the system to try to choose the winner. The live-themed, black and white music video premiered on MySpace Music on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 2009, their first live video since 2002&#x27;s &quot;Deadbolt.&quot;

Thrice&#x27;s spring (2010) tour with Manchester Orchestra was cut short on April 23 when Kensrue had to leave because of an illness in the family.

===&quot;Major/Minor&quot; and hiatus (2011–2015)===

In an interview with Blare Magazine on June 16, 2010, Kensrue revealed that each member had been writing music for a new Thrice album individually, and that &quot;pretty soon&quot; the band would enter the studio to write and record the album collectively.

On April 20, 2011, Thrice announced on their website that their next album was ready to go and studio-bound. The album was recorded in May 2011 at Red Bull Studios, with most of the parts being recorded there and the band adding overdubs and &quot;tweaking&quot; a few things in Teppei&#x27;s home recording studio (New Grass Studios) in the days after recording at Red Bull Studios.

The new album, &quot;Major/Minor&quot;, was released on September 20, 2011, through Vagrant Records.&lt;ref name=&quot;PopMatters Major/Minor Review&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Thrice&#x27;s spring 2012 tour, the band went on hiatus. In the group&#x27;s public statement, Kensrue stated that &quot;Thrice is not breaking up,&quot; but that the band would be &quot;taking a break from being a full-time band.&quot;

Thrice, accompanied by Animals as Leaders and O&#x27;Brother, began their farewell tour on May 4, 2012, in San Diego and ended it with a 33-song solo show on June 19, 2012, in Santa Ana. The tour&#x27;s setlist song pool was determined by a fan vote on their entire song catalog (excluding First Impressions). Thrice&#x27;s second live album, &quot;Anthology&quot;, was released on October 30, 2012, on two CDs and as a quadruple 180 gram LP box set limited to 3000 copies, and features 24 songs recorded at select shows along the tour.

Thrice&#x27;s last interview aired on June 18, 2012, just one day after the band wrapped up their farewell tour. JC from theFIVE10 Radio spoke with Eddie and Teppei.

====Hiatus activities====

Riley Breckenridge plays drums in a grindcore side project called Puig Destroyer with Ian Miller (KWC), Jon Howell (KWC, Tigon), and Mike Minnick (Curl Up and Die). Their self-titled demo is composed of six songs clocking in at about six minutes, which is a reference to the jersey number of Yasiel Puig (66), formerly of the Los Angeles Dodgers, whom the six song demo is inspired by. The name is a reference to both Puig and grindcore band Pig Destroyer. The demo was released on a 7&quot; 45 rpm vinyl by The Ghost Is Clear Records.

Eddie Breckenridge joined the alternative rock band Angels &amp; Airwaves in June 2014, which also features current/former members of Blink-182, Nine Inch Nails and Hazen Street. He is also in the supergroup Less Art with his brother Riley.

===Reunion and &quot;To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere&quot; (2015–2017)===

On December 22, 2014, the band posted an image on its website showing the view from behind the mixing desk, facing the band performing, overlaid with the text &quot;Thrice 2015.&quot; Kensrue and Teranishi were attending a Brand New concert when they decided to reunite the band. Two months later, Thrice began announcing their inclusion in several 2015 music festivals, including New Jersey&#x27;s Skate and Surf Fest in May; Montebello, Quebec&#x27;s Amnesia Rockfest in June; Folkestone, UK&#x27;s Hevy Music Festival in August; and three sites for Riot Fest, Denver in August as well as Chicago and Toronto in September. On October 3, Thrice performed at Taste of Chaos in San Bernardino, CA. 
On November 23, 2015, Thrice announced that they would be releasing a new album in 2016. On March 22, 2016, its title was announced as &quot;To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere&quot;, with a release date of May 27, 2016. A pre-release track, &quot;Blood on the Sand&quot;, was released a few days later. In April 2016, Thrice released the lead single from &quot;To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere&quot;, &quot;Black Honey&quot;, and announced several summer tour dates throughout the US and Europe. On May 17, ten days before the release of the album, Thrice released the official music video for their song &quot;Black Honey.&quot; It features all of the members of the band, and was directed and edited by Y2K and produced by Jason Lester. On May 23, five days before the album was released, Thrice premiered &quot;Death from Above&quot; on BBC Radio 1. Another single, &quot;Hurricane&quot;, was released April 6. The song was the highest viewed new video in its debut week in April on Loudwire&#x27;s Top 10 Video Countdown.

Through a Facebook post on March 27, 2017, Thrice announced a new EP; &quot;Sea Change&quot;. It consists of a new track from the &quot;To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere&quot; sessions, as well as a live acoustic version of &quot;Black Honey&quot;. It was released on 7-inch vinyl for Record Store Day on April 22, 2017.

===Epitaph Records and &quot;Palms&quot; (2018–2019)===

In June 2018, the band confirmed that they had signed to Epitaph Records. On June 5, 2018, they released their first song under Epitaph Records called &quot;The Grey.&quot; The band also announced a headlining tour with The Bronx and Teenage Wrist. It was later announced &quot;The Grey&quot; was the lead single from their tenth studio album, &quot;Palms&quot;. It was slated for release on September 14, 2018. On July 10, 2018, the band released a music video for &quot;The Grey.&quot; On August 14, 2018, the band released &quot;Only Us&quot;, their second single from &quot;Palms&quot;.

&quot;[&#x27;The Grey&#x27;] is about attempting to see what&#x27;s actually unfolding around you instead of seeing what you have decided is there,&quot; said Kensrue.

Riley Breckenridge gave an in-depth interview regarding the album in September 2018. Talking about &#x27;Only Us&#x27; Breckenridge stated: &quot;It’s a song about inclusion and compassion and togetherness — realizing that we’re all connected and should be able to rally around that to make the world a better place.&quot;.

Palms was produced by Eric Palmquist, whom the band had worked with in the past. Breckenridge also spoke about working with Palmquist on this record saying: &quot;He&#x27;s great to work with. We communicate really well. He pushes me hard, but he&#x27;s also a really patient and encouraging person, which is invaluable in a studio setting.&quot;

Through an Instagram post on March 1, 2019, Thrice announced a new EP; &quot;Deeper Wells&quot;. It consists of four new tracks recorded during the &quot;Palms&quot; sessions. The EP was released on 12&quot; vinyl for Record Store Day on April 13, 2019.

=== &quot;Horizons/East&quot; (2021–present) ===

On July 20, 2021, Thrice released a new single &quot;Scavengers.&quot; On the same day, they also announced their new album &quot;Horizons/East&quot; via Epitaph Records to be released digitally on September 17, 2021, with a physical release on October 8, 2021. In an Interview on the new record the band announced that they had actually written 20 songs, of which only 10 were included on the record. The rest is planned to be released on a companion record called &quot;Horizons/West&quot;.

On May 17, 2022, Thrice released a single, &quot;Dead Wake&quot;, recorded during the &quot;Horizons/East&quot; sessions but never made the album. They released another B-side on September 20, 2022, called &quot;Open Your Eyes and Dream&quot;.

In honor of the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot;, the band released a rerecorded version of the album on February 1, 2023, with new instrumentation and vocals, as well as guest spots from Andy Hull of Manchester Orchestra, Sam Carter of Architects, Ryan Osterman of Holy Fawn, Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music, Mike Minnick of Curl Up and Die and Brian McTernan, who had produced the original album. &quot;We know that playing the revisionist is a dangerous game,&quot; said Dustin Kensrue, &quot;so we were always a little uneasy about trying to go back and mess with something that people loved, people who had none of the hangups about the record that we did. But, since we decided to do this anyway, we tried to let that wariness guide us in how we approached the record, and in the end we decided to make very minimal structural changes.&quot;

==Solo activities==

Dustin Kensrue released his first solo album on Equal Vision Records on January 23, 2007, &quot;Please Come Home&quot;. The album opened at 142 on the Billboard 200. The follow-up was released in 2008, and was called &quot;This Good Night Is Still Everywhere.&quot; This album featured two original Christmas songs and various covers of Christmas carols.

Dustin Kensrue revived his solo career by gathering Lee Neujahr (drums), Phil Neujahr (bass), and Jonny Sandu (synth) in order to form The Modern Post. The Modern Post released their first EP in 2012 called &quot;The Water &amp; the Blood&quot;. Next, Kensrue released a worship album under his own name, &quot;The Water &amp; the Blood&quot;, on September 30, 2013. On November 24, 2014, Kensrue&#x27;s band The Modern Post released a Christmas EP, &quot;Lowborn King&quot;, that featured various Christmas songs and an alternate version of Kensrue&#x27;s song, &quot;This Is War&quot;. Kensrue&#x27;s next release was on April 21, 2015, called &quot;Carry the Fire.&quot; Lastly, on March 18, 2016, Kensrue released an album of live covers of popular songs, &quot;Thoughts That Float on a Different Blood&quot;.

When asked about his next work, Dustin Kensrue said he will be working on a project with his brother that will be very different from both Thrice and his solo work&quot;.&quot;

Teppei Teranishi is in a side project with Chris Jones called Black Unicorn. Chris Jones also played drums and electric guitar on Dustin&#x27;s solo album.

Dustin Kensrue provided guest vocals and Teppei Teranishi played guitar/provided production on The Out Circuit&#x27;s album &quot;Pierce The Empire With a Sound&quot;.

==Musical style, influences and legacy==
While mostly considered a post-hardcore band, Thrice has also been described as alternative rock, pop punk, experimental rock, art rock, hard rock, melodic hardcore, emo, screamo, thrash metal, indie rock, hardcore punk, heavy metal, and punk rock. While describing Thrice as post-hardcore, AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus also described their sound as a mix of punk, screamo, and pop with progressive tendencies.

Thrice&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; and &quot;The Illusion of Safety&quot; have been described as metal and punk influenced post-hardcore. Thrice&#x27;s earlier music was known for being melodic, yet fast and based in heavily distorted guitars, prominent lead guitar lines, and frequent changes in complex time signatures. This style was mainly demonstrated on their second album, &quot;The Illusion of Safety,&quot; and their third album &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance.&quot; Their first three albums have considered to have elements of thrash metal, screamo, and pop punk. On their fourth album, &quot;Vheissu,&quot; the band incorporated electronic beats, keyboards, and more experimental and nuanced songwriting. Their fifth and sixth albums, &quot;The Alchemy Index Vols. I &amp; II&quot; and &quot;The Alchemy Index Vols. III &amp; IV,&quot; both included two discs, six tracks each. All discs represented one of the four classical elements: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. The albums were described as a turn to progressive rock. Each of the four parts experiment with different sounds: Fire (heavy rock), Water (trip hop), Air (atmospheric rock), and Earth (folk rock). Their seventh album, &quot;Beggars&quot;, and their eighth album, &quot;Major/Minor&quot;, included post-rock and indie influences. When describing their ninth studio album, &quot;To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere&quot;, Riley Breckenridge said, &quot;I think there is a different sound but I also think that there is a healthy nod to some of our back catalog in a lot of the music. There&#x27;s stuff on this record that wouldn&#x27;t necessarily feel out of place on &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot;, or &quot;Vheissu&quot; or wouldn&#x27;t have felt out of place if it was part of &quot;The Alchemy Index&quot; or &quot;Beggars&quot;, or &quot;Major/Minor&quot;. But at the same time it&#x27;s also pushing that kind of stuff forward.&quot; Similarly, Kensrue said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that this new record sounds like a huge jump. It&#x27;s very different from &quot;Major/Minor&quot; or &quot;Beggars&quot;, but I feel like it&#x27;s not this giant move.&quot; When talking about &quot;Palms&quot;, Dustin stated that &quot;It&#x27;s definitely a bit more diverse musically than the last few records. As far as the approach, it&#x27;s probably most similar to Vheissu in that we were trying to pull from a very wide variety of influences&quot; &quot;Guitar World&quot; called Thrice the &quot;Radiohead of post-hardcore&quot;.

Thrice have cited numerous bands as influences, including Fugazi, Refused, Poison the Well, Miles Davis, Isis, Hot Snakes, No Knife, Pixies, Thelonious Monk, and Radiohead.

Nothing More lead vocalist Jonny Hawkins cites Thrice as an influence.

<text>The Wasps () is the fourth in chronological order of the eleven surviving plays by Aristophanes. It was produced at the Lenaia festival in 422 BC, during Athens&#x27; short-lived respite from the Peloponnesian War.

As in his other early plays, Aristophanes satirizes the Athenian general and demagogue Cleon. He also ridicules the law courts, one of the institutions that provided Cleon his power. The play has been thought to exemplify Old Comedy.

==Plot==
The play begins with a strange scene—a large net has been spread over a house, the entry is barricaded and two slaves, Xanthias and Sosias, are sleeping in the street outside. A third man is positioned at the top of an exterior wall with a view into the inner courtyard but he too is asleep. The two slaves wake and we learn from their banter that they are keeping guard over a &quot;monster.&quot; The man asleep above them is their master and the monster is his father—he has an unusual disease. Xanthias and Sosias challenge the audience to guess the nature of the disease. Addictions to gambling, drink and good times are suggested but they are all wrong—the father is addicted to the law court: he is a &quot;phileliastes&quot; () or a &quot;trialophile.&quot; The man&#x27;s name is &quot;Philocleon&quot; (which suggests that he might be addicted to Cleon), and his son&#x27;s name is the very opposite of this—&quot;Bdelycleon&quot;. The symptoms of the old man&#x27;s addiction include irregular sleep, obsessional thinking, paranoia, poor hygiene and hoarding. Counselling, medical treatment and travel have all failed to solve the problem, and now his son has turned the house into a prison to keep the old man away from the law courts.

Bdelycleon wakes and he shouts to the two slaves to be on their guard—his father is moving about. He tells them to watch the drains, for the old man can move like a mouse, but Philocleon surprises them all by emerging instead from the chimney disguised as smoke. Bdelycleon is luckily on hand to push him back inside. Other attempts at escape are also barely defeated. The household settles down for some more sleep and then the Chorus arrives—old jurors who move warily through the muddy roads and are escorted by boys with lamps through the dark. Learning of their old comrade&#x27;s imprisonment, they leap to his defense and swarm around Bdelycleon and his slaves like wasps. At the end of this fray, Philocleon is still barely in his son&#x27;s custody and both sides are willing to settle the issue peacefully through debate.

The debate between the Philocleon and Bdelycleon focuses on the advantages that the old man personally derives from voluntary jury service. Philocleon says he enjoys the flattering attentions of rich and powerful men who appeal to him for a favourable verdict, he enjoys the freedom to interpret the law as he pleases since his decisions are not subject to review, and his juror&#x27;s pay gives him independence and authority within his own household. Bdelycleon responds to these points with the argument that jurors are in fact subject to the demands of petty officials and they get paid less than they deserve—revenues from the empire go mostly into the private treasuries of men like Cleon. These arguments have a paralysing effect on Philocleon. The chorus is won over.

Philocleon refuses to give up his old ways, so Bdelycleon offers to turn the house into a courtroom and to pay him a juror&#x27;s fee to judge domestic disputes. Philocleon agrees, and a case is soon brought before him—a dispute between the household dogs. One dog (who looks like Cleon) accuses the other dog (who looks like Laches) of stealing a Sicilian cheese and not sharing it. Witnesses for the defense include a bowl, a pestle, a cheese-grater, a brazier and a pot. As these are unable to speak, Bdelycleon says a few words for them on behalf of the accused. A group of puppies (the children of the accused) is ushered in to soften the heart of the old juror with their plaintive cries. Philocleon is not softened, but his son easily fools him into putting his vote into the urn for acquittal. The old juror is deeply shocked by the outcome of the trial—he is used to convictions—but his son promises him a good time and they exit the stage to prepare for some entertainment.

While the actors are offstage, the Chorus addresses the audience in a conventional parabasis. It praises the author for standing up to monsters like Cleon and it chastises the audience for its failure to appreciate the merits of the author&#x27;s previous play (&quot;The Clouds&quot;). It praises the older generation, evokes memories of the victory at Marathon, and bitterly deplores the gobbling up of imperial revenues by unworthy men. Father and son then return to the stage, now arguing with each other over the old man&#x27;s choice of attire. He is addicted to his old juryman&#x27;s cloak and his old shoes and he is suspicious of the fancy woollen garment and the fashionable Spartan footwear that Bdelycleon wants him to wear that evening to a sophisticated dinner party. The fancy clothes are forced upon him, and he is instructed in the kind of manners and conversation that the other guests will expect of him. At the party, Philocleon declares his reluctance to drink any wine—it causes trouble, he says—but Bdelycleon assures him that sophisticated men of the world can easily talk their way out of trouble, and so they depart optimistically for the evening&#x27;s entertainment.

There is then a second parabasis (see Note at end of this section), in which the Chorus touches briefly on a conflict between Cleon and the author, after which a household slave arrives with news for the audience about the old man&#x27;s appalling behaviour at the dinner party: Philocleon has got himself abusively drunk, he has insulted all his son&#x27;s fashionable friends, and now he is assaulting anyone he meets on the way home. The slave departs as Philocleon arrives, now with aggrieved victims on his heels and a pretty flute girl on his arm. Bdelycleon appears moments later and angrily remonstrates with his father for kidnapping the flute girl from the party. Philocleon pretends that she is in fact a torch. His son isn&#x27;t fooled and he tries to take the girl back to the party by force but his father knocks him down. Other people with grievances against Philocleon continue to arrive, demanding compensation and threatening legal action. He makes an ironic attempt to talk his way out of trouble like a sophisticated man of the world, but it inflames the situation further. Finally, his alarmed son drags him indoors. The Chorus sings briefly about how difficult it is for men to change their habits and it commends the son for filial devotion, after which the entire cast returns to the stage for some spirited dancing by Philocleon in a contest with the sons of Carcinus.

Note: Some editors (such as Barrett) exchange the second parabasis (lines 1265–91) with the song (lines 1450–73) in which Bdelycleon is commended for filial devotion.

==Historical background==

===Cleon and the Athenian jury system===
About two years before the performance of &quot;The Wasps&quot;, Athens had obtained a significant victory against its rival, Sparta, in the Battle of Sphacteria. Rightly or wrongly, most Athenians credited Cleon with this victory, and he was then at the height of his power. Constitutionally, supreme power lay with the People as voters in the assembly and as jurors in the courts, but they could be manipulated by demagogues skilled in oratory and supported by networks of satellites and informers. Cleon had succeeded Pericles as the dominant speaker in the assembly, and increasingly he could manipulate the courts for political and personal ends, especially in the prosecution of public officials for mismanagement of their duties.

Jurors had to be citizens over the age of thirty and a corps of 6,000 was enrolled at the beginning of each year, forming a conspicuous presence about town in their short brown cloaks, with wooden staves in their hands. The work was voluntary but time-consuming and they were paid a small fee: three obols per day at the time of &quot;The Wasps&quot;. For many jurors, this was their major source of income and it was virtually an old-age pension. There were no judges to provide juries with legal guidance, and there was no legal appeal against a jury&#x27;s verdict. Jurors came under the sway of litigious politicians like Cleon who provided them with cases to try and who were influential in persuading the Assembly to keep up their pay. However it is not necessarily true that Cleon was exploiting the system for venal or corrupt reasons, as argued in &quot;The Wasps&quot;.

Aristophanes&#x27; plays promote conservative values and support an honourable peace with Sparta, whereas Cleon was a radical democrat and a leader of the pro-war faction. Misunderstandings were inevitable. Cleon had previously attempted to prosecute Aristophanes for slandering the &quot;polis&quot; with his second play &quot;The Babylonians&quot;, and though the legal result of these efforts is unknown, they appear to have sharpened the poet&#x27;s satirical edge, as evidenced later in the unrelenting attack on Cleon in &quot;The Knights&quot;. The second parabasis in &quot;The Wasps&quot; implies that Cleon retaliated for his drubbing in &quot;The Knights&quot; with yet further efforts to intimidate or prosecute Aristophanes, and the poet may have publicly yielded to this pressure for a short time. Whatever agreement was reached with Cleon, Aristophanes gleefully reneged on it in &quot;The Wasps&quot;, presenting Cleon as a treacherous dog manipulating a corrupted legal process for personal gain.

===Some events that influenced &quot;The Wasps&quot;===
*431: The Peloponnesian War commenced.
*426: Aristophanes won first prize at the City Dionysia with his second play, &quot;The Babylonians&quot; (now lost), and he was subsequently prosecuted by Cleon for being the author of slanders against the polis.
*425: Athens obtained a significant victory against Sparta in the Battle of Sphacteria and Cleon successfully claimed responsibility for it.
*424: Aristophanes won first prize at the Lenaia with &quot;The Knights&quot; in which he lampooned Cleon mercilessly.
*423: Athens and Sparta agreed to a one-year truce. Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;The Clouds&quot; came third (i.e. last).
*422: &quot;The Wasps&quot; was performed at the Lenaia, winning second place.

==Discussion==
Some scholars regard &quot;The Wasps&quot; as one of the greatest comedies in literature. Various factors contribute to its appeal, as for example:
*The central figure, Philocleon, is a &#x27;triumph of characterization&#x27;;
*The jurors have been considered the most vividly realized Chorus in Old Comedy;
*The juror&#x27;s son has been viewed as the most lifelike child in Greek drama.
Philocleon is a complex character whose actions have comic significance, psychological significance and allegorical significance. When, for example, he strikes his son for taking the dancing girl away, the violence is comic because it is unexpected of an old man yet it is psychologically appropriate because he is struggling to overcome an addiction and it represents in allegorical form the theme expressed by the Chorus in the parabasis: the old customs are better and more manly than the new fashions. When the play opens, Philocleon is a prisoner of his son and, when the Chorus enters, the old jurors are found to be virtual prisoners of their sons too – they rely on the boys to help them through the dark, muddy streets. The Chorus leader&#x27;s boy takes full advantage of the situation, threatening to abandon his elderly father if he won&#x27;t buy him some figs. The debilitating effects of old age and the dehumanizing effects of an addiction (Philocleon is said to resemble a jackdaw, a mouse, a limpet, smoke, a donkey&#x27;s foal, a cut of meat, Odysseus and Nobody) are somber themes that lift the action beyond the scope of a mere farce.

==&quot;The Wasps&quot; and Old Comedy==
&quot;The Wasps&quot; has been thought to exemplify all the conventions of Old Comedy at their best – structural elements that are common to most of Aristophanes&#x27; plays are all found in this play in a complete and readily identifiable form. The table below is based on one scholar&#x27;s interpretation of the play&#x27;s structural elements and the poetic meters associated with them.

==Miscellaneous==

* In 1909, the English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams created popular incidental music for the play – see The Wasps (Vaughan Williams).

* In 2025, an English language film adaptation was released.

<text>Ahmet Kenan Evren (; 17 July 1917 – 9 May 2015) was a Turkish politician and military officer who served as the seventh President of Turkey from 1980 to 1989. He assumed the post by leading the 1980 military coup.

On 18 June 2014, a Turkish court sentenced him to life imprisonment and demotion of his military rank, (down to private from army general) for leading the military coup in 1980. He was found guilty of obstructing democracy by deposing the prime minister Süleyman Demirel and of abolishing the parliament, senate and the constitution. This sentence was under appeal at the time of his death.

==Biography==
Ahmet Kenan Evren was born in Alaşehir, Manisa Province. His father, who was an imam, was of Albanian origins. He was originally from the town of Preševo and immigrated to Turkey to live with his uncle, who was in Istanbul. Kenan Evren&#x27;s mother was from a Turkish Bulgarian background. After going to elementary school and middle school in Manisa, Balıkesir and Istanbul, he attended military high school in Maltepe, Ankara. In 1938, he graduated from army school and in 1949 from military academy as a staff officer.

From 1958 to 1959, he served in the Turkish Brigade in Korea. In 1964, he was promoted to general. Evren served at various posts as Army Chief. He was the commander of Operation Gladio&#x27;s Turkish branch; the Counter-Guerrilla. The Counter-Guerrilla was an anti-communist &quot;stay-behind&quot; guerrilla force set up with the support of NATO. He became Chief of General Staff in March 1978. He was selected by then Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit for not being a member of any political group inside the Turkish Military

==1980 military coup d&#x27;état==

The years leading to the coup were characterized as a fierce struggle between the far-right and the far-left. Hoping to see a communist revolution, the leftist militants rioted in the streets; on the other hand, the right-wing nationalist militants fought back the left-wing revolutionaries and provoked religious arousal. Universities had taken sides and each became headquarters for either the leftists or the rightists. The chaotic situation created by far-left and far-right groups had destroyed public security in the country. Communist and neo-fascist groups tried to keep even the streets under their control, beating or killing anyone who was not one of them. Finally, an anti-secularist rally organised by Islamists in Konya on 6 September 1980 was the last straw.

With the coup came the National Security Council as the ruling body. The council of 1980 was composed of the commanders Kenan Evren, the Chief of Staff and President of the State. The parliament was dissolved. On a speech in Muş in 1984, about the execution of Erdal Eren, a communist militant alleged 17-year-old but according to official records born in 1961 who was accused of killing a Turkish soldier, he said &quot;Now, after I catch him, I will put him on trial, and then I will not execute him, I will take care of him for life. I will feed that traitor who took a gun to these Mehmetçiks who shed their blood for this homeland for years. Would you agree to that?!&quot; 

== President of Turkey ==

After the coup, Kenan Evren was elected as President of Turkey on 7 November 1982 with the 91.37% approval of the new constitution that was submitted to a controversial referendum, replacing the older constitution which, according to him, had liberties too &quot;luxurious&quot; for Turkey.

Evren suspended many forms of civil liberties and human rights on the grounds that it was necessary to establish stability. He professed great admiration for the founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

Kenan Evren despite being a staunch defender of Kemalism used a religious rhetoric in his speeches to make his remarks more relatable. 

Evren took strong measures to ensure that the division between the political left and right would not turn into violence again; the new constitution limited the rights and depoliticized the youth.

Kenan Evren&#x27;s junta regime stressed the importance of family planning and passed more liberal laws on abortion.

According to a report on the Susurluk scandal of 1996, prepared by Prime Ministry Inspection Board Deputy Chairman Kutlu Savaş, quoted by the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey, &quot;Fascists had been released from prison in return for &#x27;finishing some jobs&#x27; under Evren&#x27;s rule after 12 September 1980&quot;.

Concerning Kurds, he denied their existence and claimed the word Kurd comes from the noise that is heard when walking in the snow. Referring to Kurds he used the term Mountain Turk.

Evren was also the last Turkish president to have been born in the Ottoman Empire.
== Post-presidency ==
After his retirement, he moved to the Turkish Mediterranean resort town of Armutalan, Marmaris, and took up painting. 

On 2 August 2006, a reported plan for assassinating Evren was thwarted when two men were apprehended and arrested in Muğla.

A previous attempt in 1996 had already been tracked down when two members of the assassination team spoke on a cellphone eavesdropped by the police, and the Islamic call to prayer (&quot;adhan&quot;) could be heard during their conversation. Since the timing of the &quot;adhan&quot; was 4–5 minutes after Istanbul, a point slightly more to the west by that time margin was sought and the team members were caught in Marmaris itself.

In 2004, he revealed that his daughter, Şenay Gürvit, and son-in-law, Erkan Gürvit, are members of the National Intelligence Organization. His daughter presided over the reprisal operations against the militant Armenian organization ASALA.

After Bülent Ecevit&#x27;s death, he expressed remorse over the arrest of political leaders after the 1980 coup, but defended the coup itself and the 35 executions.

Civilian resentment exists, and there were demands for his being called to account following the Ergenekon investigation.

==Trial and conviction==
On 10 January 2012, Turkish courts decided to press charges against General Kenan Evren and General Tahsin Şahinkaya, former Commander of the Turkish Air Force, for their role in the 1980 coup. Prosecutors sought life sentences against them. The first court hearing of the case was scheduled for 4 April 2012. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 June 2014 by a court in Ankara. In accordance with Article 30 of the Military Penal Code, Evren and Şahinkaya were demoted to the lowest rank of private; as the decision was appealed and Evren died before the final decision of the court of appeals, the demotion was not final. On his gravestone he is commemorated as the seventh President of Turkey.

== Personal life ==
Evren married Sekine Evren in 1944. They had a child that died in infancy and three daughters, Şenay, Gülay and Miray. Sekine died in 1982. In 1990, he was awarded the Atatürk International Peace Prize. He was also fluent in English.

==Illness and death==

Evren was hospitalized for massive gastrointestinal bleeding on 3 August 2009, in Yalıkavak, Bodrum, where his summer house is located. A temporary artificial pacemaker was applied to Evren while in intensive care due to bradycardia. His large intestine was removed a week later at the Gülhane Military Medical Academy (GATA) in Haydarpaşa, Istanbul where he was transferred. He was discharged on 24 September 2009.

Evren died at a military hospital in Ankara on 9 May 2015, aged 97. On 12 May, he was buried in the Turkish State Cemetery in Ankara following the funeral service held at Ahmet Hamdi Akseki Mosque. The funeral was attended by his close relatives and military personnel. In protest, political parties sent no representatives to the former president&#x27;s funeral. A number of people protested during the religious service in the mosque&#x27;s courtyard.

<doc id="617364" wikidata="Q16514183" url="?curid=617364" title="Skögul and Geirskögul">
<text>In Norse mythology, Skögul (Old Norse: &quot;Skǫgul&quot;, &quot;shaker&quot; or possibly &quot;high-towering&quot;) and Geirskögul (Old Norse: &quot;Geirskǫgul&quot;, &quot;spear-skögul&quot;) are valkyries who alternately appear as separate or individual figures. Both valkyries appear in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; where they seem to be the same being, and are otherwise listed separately in the valkyrie lists in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poems &quot;Völuspá&quot; and &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, the longer of the two valkyrie lists in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; yet Skögul appears alone in the shorter of the two. Skögul appears in kennings but Geirskögul does not.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Heimskringla&quot;===
In &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;, Odin sends forth the two valkyries Göndul and Skögul to &quot;choose among the kings&#x27; kinsmen&quot; and decide who in battle should dwell with Odin in Valhalla. A battle rages with great slaughter, and part of the description employs the kenning &quot;Skögul&#x27;s-stormblast&quot; for &quot;battle&quot;. Haakon and his men die in battle, and they see the valkyrie Göndul leaning on a spear shaft. Göndul comments that &quot;groweth now the gods&#x27; following, since Hákon has been with host so goodly bidden home with holy godheads.&quot; Haakon hears &quot;what the valkyries said,&quot; and the valkyries are described as sitting &quot;high-hearted on horseback,&quot; wearing helmets, carrying shields and that the horses wisely bore them. A brief exchange follows between Haakon and the valkyrie Skögul:

:&quot;Hákon said:&quot;
:&quot;Why didst Geirskogul grudge us victory?
:though worthy we were for the gods to grant it?&quot;
:&quot;Skogul said:&quot;
:&quot;&#x27;Tis owing to us that the issue was won
: and your foemen fled.&quot;

Skögul says that they shall now ride forth to the &quot;green homes of the godheads&quot; to tell Odin the king will come to Valhalla. The poem continues, and Haakon becomes a part of the Einherjar in Valhalla, awaiting to do battle with the monstrous wolf Fenrir.

===Kennings===
The name Skögul is common as a valkyrie name in kennings. Examples include:
:borð Sköglar &quot;board of Skögul&quot; (shield)
:dynr Sköglar &quot;din of Skögul&quot; (battle, e.g. in &quot;Glymdrápa&quot;)
:eldr Sköglar &quot;fire of Skögul&quot; (sword)
:gagl Sköglar &quot;gosling of Skögul&quot; (raven)
:kápa Sköglar &quot;cape of Skögul&quot; (byrnie) 
:veðr Sköglar &quot;wind of Skögul&quot; (battle, e.g. in &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;) 

The name Geirskögul does not appear in kennings, perhaps because trisyllabic names are somewhat difficult to handle in the dróttkvætt meter.

==Theories==
According to Hilda Ellis Davidson, if &quot;Skögul&quot; means &quot;high-towering&quot;, the name &quot;might be a reference to the gigantic size of these beings.&quot;

<text>In Norse mythology, Mist (Old Norse &quot;cloud&quot; or mist) is a valkyrie. Mist appears in valkyrie list in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot; and both of the &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; valkyrie lists. No further information is provided about her. Rudolf Simek says that her name, &quot;Mist&quot;, is likely related to Old Norse &quot;mistr&quot;, meaning &quot;cloud, mist,&quot; and that this &quot;reminds us of the way in which valkyries can ride through the air and over water,&quot; such as in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poems &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot; and &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot;.

<doc id="617374" wikidata="Q3269279" url="?curid=617374" title="Róta">
<text>In Norse mythology, Róta is a valkyrie. Róta is attested in chapter 36 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, where she is mentioned alongside the valkyries Gunnr and Skuld, and the three are described as &quot;always [riding] to choose who shall be slain and to govern the killings.&quot; Otherwise, Róta appears in two kennings, one by Egill Skallagrímsson and one by Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld. Theories have been proposed about the possible appearance of Róta in and the meaning of her name.

==Theories==

===Name===
According to Guðbrandur Vigfússon, the name &quot;Róta&quot; is connected to the Old Norse noun &quot;róta&quot; (meaning &quot;sleet and storm&quot;) and Róta is &quot;a goddess who sends storm and rain.&quot;

===&quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;===
In book two of , a female by the name of &quot;Ruta&quot; is mentioned:

:Arise too, Ruta, and show your snow-pale head,
:come forth from hiding and issue into battle.
:The outdoor carnage beckons you; fighting now
:shakes the court, harsh strife batters the gates.

Axel Olrik considered this as an isolated reference to Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s widow Hrut mourning on the battlefield with blond hair. Hilda Ellis Davidson says &quot;it seems more probable that it is a reference to the deathly pale head of the valkyrie, the spirit brooding over the battlefield personifying slaughter, who is summoned at the outset of battle.&quot; Davidson points out that &quot;Róta&quot; is the name of a valkyrie, and that &quot;it seems preferable to assume&quot; this to Olrik&#x27;s theory. Davidson says that while this is, however, complicated by an earlier mention in book two of Hrólfr Kraki&#x27;s sister and Bödvar Bjarki&#x27;s wife &quot;Hrut&quot;, yet this &quot;Hrut&quot; is not found elsewhere as a female name.

In book six of , a figure by the name of &quot;Rothi&quot; is mentioned:

:Say, Rothi, perpetual mocker of cowards, do you think
:we have made Frothi adequate restitution
:by paying him seven deaths in revenge for one?
:See, they are borne lifeless who gave you homage
:only in show and beneath subserviance planned
:treachery.&quot;

According to Davidson, this &quot;Rothi&quot; may be the same as Róta, though it has been alternately theorized that &quot;Rothi&quot; may be a name of Odin.

<text>Sir Ernest Mason Satow, (30 June 1843 – 26 August 1929), was a British diplomat, scholar and Japanologist. He is better known in Japan, where he was known as , than in Britain or the other countries in which he served as a diplomat. He was a key figure in late 19th-century Anglo-Japanese relations.

Satow was influential in East Asia and Japan, particularly in the Bakumatsu (1853–1867) and Meiji (1868–1912) eras. He also served in China after the Boxer Rebellion (1900–1906), in Siam, Uruguay, and Morocco, and represented Britain at the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907. In his retirement, he wrote &quot;A Guide to Diplomatic Practice&quot;. Now known as &#x27;Satow&#x27;s Guide to Diplomatic Practice&#x27;, this manual is still widely used today, and has been updated several times by distinguished diplomats, notably Lord Gore-Booth. The sixth edition, edited by Sir Ivor Roberts, was published by Oxford University Press in 2009, and is over 700 pages long.

Satow was born in Clapton, London, the son of Hans David Christoph Satow (born in Wismar, then under Swedish rule, naturalised British in 1846) and his English wife Margaret (née Mason). He was educated at Mill Hill School and University College London (UCL).

Satow was an exceptional linguist, an energetic traveller, a writer of travel guidebooks, a dictionary compiler, a mountaineer, a keen botanist (chiefly with Frederick Dickins) and a major collector of Japanese books and manuscripts on all kinds of subjects. Satow kept a diary for most of his adult life which amounts to 47 mostly handwritten volumes.

== Diplomatic career ==

=== Japan (1862–1883) ===

Ernest Satow is probably best known as the author of the book &quot;&quot; (based mainly on his diaries) which describes the years 1862–1869 when Japan was changing from rule by the Tokugawa shogunate to the restoration of Imperial rule. He was recruited by the Foreign Office straight out of university in London. Within a week of his arrival by way of China as a young student interpreter in the British Japan Consular Service, at age 19, the Namamugi Incident (Namamugi Jiken), in which a British merchant was killed on the Tōkaidō, took place on 21 August 1862. Satow was on board one of the British ships that sailed to Kagoshima in August 1863 to obtain the compensation demanded from the Satsuma clan&#x27;s &quot;daimyō&quot;, Shimazu Hisamitsu, for the slaying of Charles Lennox Richardson. They were fired on by the Satsuma shore batteries and retaliated by bombarding Kagoshima.

In 1864, Satow was with the allied force (Britain, France, the Netherlands and the United States) that attacked Shimonoseki to enforce the right of passage of foreign ships through the narrow Kanmon Straits between Honshū and Kyūshū. Satow met Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū for the first time just before the bombardment of Shimonoseki. He also had links with many other Japanese leaders, including Saigō Takamori of Satsuma (who became a friend), and toured the hinterland of Japan with A. B. Mitford and the cartoonist and illustrator Charles Wirgman.

Satow&#x27;s rise in the consular service was due at first to his competence and zeal as an interpreter at a time when English was virtually unknown in Japan, the Japanese government still communicated with the West in Dutch and available study aids were exceptionally few. Employed as a consular interpreter alongside Russell Robertson, Satow became a student of Rev. Samuel Robbins Brown, and an associate of Dr. James Curtis Hepburn, two noted pioneers in the study of the Japanese language. His Japanese language skills quickly became indispensable in the British Minister Sir Harry Parkes&#x27;s negotiations with the failing Tokugawa shogunate and the powerful Satsuma and Chōshū clans, and the gathering of intelligence. He was promoted to full Interpreter and then Japanese Secretary to the British legation, and, as early as 1864, he started to write translations and newspaper articles on subjects relating to Japan. In 1869, he went home to England on leave, returning to Japan in 1870.

Satow was one of the founding members at Yokohama, in 1872, of the Asiatic Society of Japan whose purpose was to study the Japanese culture, history and language (i.e. Japanology) in detail. He lectured to the Society on several occasions in the 1870s, and the Transactions of the Asiatic Society contain several of his published papers. His 1874 article on Japan covering various aspects including Japanese Literature that appeared in the New American Cyclopædia was one of the first such authentic pieces written in any European language. The Society is still thriving today.

During his time in Japan, Satow devoted much effort to studying Chinese calligraphy under Kōsai Tanzan 高斎単山 (1818–1890), who gave him the artist&#x27;s name Seizan 静山 in 1873. An example of Satow&#x27;s calligraphy, signed as Seizan, was acquired by the British Library in 2004.

=== Siam, Uruguay, Morocco (1884–1895) ===
Satow served in Siam (1884–1887), during which time he was accorded the rare honour of promotion from the Consular to the Diplomatic service, Uruguay (1889–93) and Morocco (1893–95). (Such promotion was extraordinary because the British Consular and Diplomatic Services were segregated until the mid-20th century, and Satow did not come from the aristocratic class to which the Diplomatic Service was restricted.)

=== Japan (1895–1900) ===
Satow returned to Japan as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary on 28 July 1895. He stayed in Tokyo for five years (though he was on leave in London for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1897 and met her in August at Osborne House, Isle of Wight). On 17 April 1895 the Treaty of Shimonoseki (text here) had been signed, and Satow was able to observe firsthand the steady build-up of the Japanese army and navy to avenge the humiliation suffered by Russia, Germany and France in the Triple Intervention of 23 April 1895. He was also in a position to oversee the transition to the ending of extraterritoriality in Japan which finally ended in 1899, as agreed by the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed in London on 16 July 1894.

On Satow&#x27;s personal recommendation, Hiram Shaw Wilkinson, who had been a student interpreter in Japan 2 years after Satow, was appointed first, Judge of the British Court for Japan in 1897 and in 1900 Chief Justice of the British Supreme Court for China and Corea.

Satow built a house at Lake Chūzenji in 1896 and went there frequently to relax and escape from the pressures of his work in Tokyo.

Satow did not have the good fortune to be named the first British Ambassador to Japan - the honour was instead bestowed on his successor Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald in 1905.

=== China (1900–1906) ===
Satow served as the British High Commissioner (September 1900 – January 1902) and then Minister in Peking from 1902 to 1906. He was active as plenipotentiary in the negotiations to conclude the Boxer Protocol which settled the compensation claims of the Powers after the Boxer Rebellion, and he signed the protocol for Britain on 7 September 1901. He received the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list. From December 1902 until summer 1903 he was on leave back home in England, during which he received the Grand Cross in person from King Edward VII on 18 January 1903 during a visit to Sandringham House.

Satow signed the in 1904. He also observed the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) from his Peking post.

=== Retirement (1906–1929) ===
In 1906 Satow was made a Privy Councillor. In 1907 he was Britain&#x27;s second plenipotentiary at the Second Hague Peace Conference.

In retirement (1906–1929) at Ottery St Mary in Devon, England, he wrote mainly on subjects connected with diplomacy and international law. In Britain, he is less well known than in Japan, where he is recognised as perhaps the most important foreign observer in the Bakumatsu and Meiji periods. He gave the Rede lecture at Cambridge University in 1908 on the career of Count Joseph Alexander Hübner. It was titled &quot;An Austrian Diplomat in the Fifties&quot;. Satow chose this subject with discretion to avoid censure from the British Foreign Office for discussing his own career.

As the years passed, Satow&#x27;s understanding and appreciation of the Japanese evolved and deepened. For example, one of his diary entries from the early 1860s asserts that the submissive character of the Japanese will make it easy for foreigners to govern them after the &quot;samurai problem&quot; could be resolved; but in retirement, he wrote: &quot;... looking back now in 1919, it seems perfectly ludicrous that such a notion should have been entertained, even as a joke, for a single moment, by anyone who understood the Japanese spirit.&quot; 
Satow&#x27;s extensive diaries and letters (the Satow Papers, PRO 30/33 1-23) are kept at the Public Record Office at Kew, West London in accordance with his last will and testament. His letters to Geoffrey Drage, sometime MP, are held in the Library and Archives of Christ Church, Oxford. Many of his rare Japanese books are now part of the Oriental collection of the Cambridge University Library and his collection of Japanese prints are in the British Museum.

He died on 26 August 1929 at Ottery St Mary, and is buried in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ottery St Mary.

== Japanese family ==

Satow was never able, as a diplomat serving in Japan, to marry his Japanese common-law wife, Takeda Kane 武田兼 (1853–1932) whom he met at an unknown date. They had an unnamed daughter who was born and died in infancy in 1872, and later two sons in 1880 and 1883, Eitaro and Hisayoshi. &quot;Eitaro was diagnosed with TB in London in 1900, and was advised to go and live in the United States, where he died some time before his father. (1925-29).&quot;

Satow&#x27;s second son, Takeda Hisayoshi, became a noted botanist, founder of the Japan Natural History Society and from 1948 to 1951 was President of the Japan Alpine Club. He studied at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and at Birmingham University. A memorial hall for him is in the Oze marshlands in Hinoemata, Fukushima Prefecture.

The Takeda family letters, including many of Satow&#x27;s to and from his family, have been deposited at the Yokohama Archives of History (formerly the British consulate in Yokohama) at the request of Satow&#x27;s granddaughters.

Charles Rickerby), dated 16 March, 4 May (? date uncertain) and 19 May 1866 which apparently influenced many Japanese once it was translated and widely distributed under the title &quot;Eikoku sakuron&quot; (British policy), and probably helped to hasten the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Satow pointed out that the British and other treaties with foreign countries had been made by the Shogun on behalf of Japan, but that the Emperor&#x27;s existence had not even been mentioned, thus calling into question their validity. Satow accused the Shogun of fraud, and demanded to know who was the &#x27;real head&#x27; of Japan and further a revision of the treaties to reflect the political reality. He later admitted in &quot;A Diplomat in Japan&quot; (p. 155 of the Tuttle reprint edition, p. 159 of the first edition) that writing the articles had been &#x27;altogether contrary to the rules of the service&#x27; (i.e. it is inappropriate for a diplomat or consular agent to interfere in the politics of a country in which he/she is serving). [The first and third articles are reproduced on pp. 566–75 of Grace Fox, &quot;Britain and Japan 1858–1883&quot;, Oxford: Clarendon Press 1969, but the second one has only been located in the Japanese translation.

== In popular culture==
In September 1992, BBC Two screened &quot;A Diplomat in Japan&quot; in the &quot;Timewatch&quot; documentary strand. Written and directed by Christopher Railing, it starred Alan Parnaby as Satow, Hitomi Tanabe as Takeda Kane, Ken Teraizumi as Ito Hirobumi, Takeshi Iba as Inoue Kaoru, and Christian Burgess as Charles Wirgman. 
* &quot;A Clash of Cultures&quot; (23 September 1992)

Satow served as inspiration for the characters of both Nathan Algren and Simon Graham in the 2003 film &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;. He also features in the 2023 remake of Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin! where he tasks the main character, Sakamoto Ryōma (under the alias of Saitō Hajime), with collecting memoirs about Japan so he can better understand Japan&#x27;s history and prevent war with the United Kingdom.

<doc id="617379" wikidata="Q413988" url="?curid=617379" title="Retrotransposon">
<text>Retrotransposons (also called Class I transposable elements) are mobile elements which move in the host genome by converting their transcribed RNA into DNA through reverse transcription. Thus, they differ from Class II transposable elements, or DNA transposons, in utilizing an RNA intermediate for the transposition and leaving the transposition donor site unchanged.

Through reverse transcription, retrotransposons amplify themselves quickly to become abundant in eukaryotic genomes such as maize (49–78%) and humans (42%). They are only present in eukaryotes but share features with retroviruses such as HIV, for example, discontinuous reverse transcriptase-mediated extrachromosomal recombination.

There are two main types of retrotransposons, long terminal repeats (LTRs) and non-long terminal repeats (non-LTRs). Retrotransposons are classified based on sequence and method of transposition. Most retrotransposons in the maize genome are LTR, whereas in humans they are mostly non-LTR.

==LTR retrotransposons==
LTR retrotransposons are characterized by their long terminal repeats (LTRs), which are present at both the 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; ends of their sequences. These LTRs contain the promoters for these transposable elements (TEs), are essential for TE integration, and can vary in length from just over 100 base pairs (bp) to more than 1,000 bp. On average, LTR retrotransposons span several thousand base pairs, with the largest known examples reaching up to 30 kilobases (kb).

LTRs are highly functional sequences, and for that reason LTR and non-LTR retrotransposons differ greatly in their reverse transcription and integration mechanisms. Non-LTR retrotransposons use a target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) process, which requires the RNA of the TE to be brought to the cleavage site of the retrotransposon’s integrase, where it is reverse transcribed. In contrast, LTR retrotransposons undergo reverse transcription in the cytoplasm, utilizing two rounds of template switching, and a formation of a pre-integration complex (PIC) composed of double-stranded DNA and an integrase dimer bound to LTRs. This complex then moves into the nucleus for integration into a new genomic location.

LTR retrotransposons typically encode the proteins gag and pol, which may be combined into a single open reading frame (ORF) or separated into distinct ORFs. Similar to retroviruses, the gag protein is essential for capsid assembly and the packaging of the TE&#x27;s RNA and associated proteins. The pol protein is necessary for reverse transcription and includes these crucial domains: PR (protease), RT (reverse transcriptase), RH (RNase H), and INT (integrase). Additionally, some LTR retrotransposons have an ORF for an envelope (env) protein that is incorporated into the assembled capsid, facilitating attachment to cellular surfaces.

==Endogenous retrovirus==

An endogenous retrovirus is a retrovirus without virus pathogenic effects that has been integrated into the host genome by inserting their inheritable genetic information into cells that can be passed onto the next generation like a retrotransposon. Because of this, they share features with retroviruses and retrotransposons. When the retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome they evolve into endogenous retroviruses that influence eukaryotic genomes. So many endogenous retroviruses have inserted themselves into eukaryotic genomes that they allow insight into biology between viral-host interactions and the role of retrotransposons in evolution and disease.
Many retrotransposons share features with endogenous retroviruses, the property of recognising and fusing with the host genome. However, there is a key difference between retroviruses and retrotransposons, which is indicated by the env gene. Although similar to the gene carrying out the same function in retroviruses, the env gene is used to determine whether the gene is retroviral or retrotransposon. If the gene is retroviral it can evolve from a retrotransposon into a retrovirus. They differ by the order of sequences in pol genes. Env genes are found in LTR retrotransposon types Ty1-copia (Pseudoviridae), Ty3-gypsy (Metaviridae) and BEL/Pao. They encode glycoproteins on the retrovirus envelope needed for entry into the host cell. Retroviruses can move between cells whereas LTR retrotransposons can only move themselves into the genome of the same cell. Many vertebrate genes were formed from retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons. One endogenous retrovirus or LTR retrotransposon has the same function and genomic locations in different species, suggesting their role in evolution.

==Non-LTR retrotransposons==
Like LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons contain genes for reverse transcriptase, RNA-binding protein, nuclease, and sometimes ribonuclease H domain but they lack the long terminal repeats. RNA-binding proteins bind the RNA-transposition intermediate and nucleases are enzymes that break phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides in nucleic acids. Instead of LTRs, non-LTR retrotransposons have short repeats that can have an inverted order of bases next to each other aside from direct repeats found in LTR retrotransposons that is just one sequence of bases repeating itself.

Although they are retrotransposons, they cannot carry out reverse transcription using an RNA transposition intermediate in the same way as LTR retrotransposons. Those two key components of the retrotransposon are still necessary but the way they are incorporated into the chemical reactions is different. This is because unlike LTR retrotransposons, non-LTR retrotransposons do not contain sequences that bind tRNA.

They mostly fall into two types – LINEs (Long interspersed nuclear elements) and SINEs (Short interspersed nuclear elements). SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs.

While historically viewed as &quot;junk DNA&quot;, research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes to form new functions.

===LINEs===
When a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it inserts itself into. RNA polymerase II is the enzyme that transcribes genes into mRNA transcripts. The ends of LINE transcripts are rich in multiple adenines, the bases that are added at the end of transcription so that LINE transcripts would not be degraded. This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.

The RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome.

LINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups. Reverse transcriptase recognises these hydroxyl groups to synthesise LINE retrotransposon where the DNA is cut. Like with LTR retrotransposons, this new inserted LINE contains eukaryotic genome information so it can be copied and pasted into other genomic regions easily. The information sequences are longer and more variable than those in LTR retrotransposons.

Most LINE copies have variable length at the start because reverse transcription usually stops before DNA synthesis is complete. In some cases this causes RNA polymerase II promoter to be lost so LINEs cannot transpose further.
====Human L1====

LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons make up a significant portion of the human genome, with an estimated 500,000 copies per genome. Genes encoding for human LINE1 usually have their transcription inhibited by methyl groups binding to its DNA carried out by PIWI proteins and enzymes DNA methyltransferases. L1 retrotransposition can disrupt the nature of genes transcribed by pasting themselves inside or near genes which could in turn lead to human disease. LINE1s can only retrotranspose in some cases to form different chromosome structures contributing to differences in genetics between individuals. There is an estimate of 80–100 active L1s in the reference genome of the Human Genome Project, and an even smaller number of L1s within those active L1s retrotranspose often. L1 insertions have been associated with tumorigenesis by activating cancer-related genes oncogenes and diminishing tumor suppressor genes.

Each human LINE1 contains two regions from which gene products can be encoded. The first coding region contains a leucine zipper protein involved in protein-protein interactions and a protein that binds to the terminus of nucleic acids. The second coding region has a purine/pyrimidine nuclease, reverse transcriptase and protein rich in amino acids cysteines and histidines. The end of the human LINE1, as with other retrotransposons is adenine-rich.

Human L1 actively retrotransposes in the human genome. A recent study identified 1,708 somatic L1 retrotransposition events, especially in colorectal epithelial cells. These events occur from early embryogenesis and retrotransposition rate is substantially increased during colorectal tumourigenesis.

===SINEs===

SINEs are much shorter (300bp) than LINEs. They share similarity with genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes genes into mRNA transcripts, and the initiation sequence of RNA polymerase III, the enzyme that transcribes genes into ribosomal RNA, tRNA and other small RNA molecules. SINEs such as mammalian MIR elements have tRNA gene at the start and adenine-rich at the end like in LINEs.

SINEs do not encode a functional reverse transcriptase protein and rely on other mobile transposons, especially LINEs. SINEs exploit LINE transposition components despite LINE-binding proteins prefer binding to LINE RNA. SINEs cannot transpose by themselves because they cannot encode SINE transcripts. They usually consist of parts derived from tRNA and LINEs. The tRNA portion contains an RNA polymerase III promoter which the same kind of enzyme as RNA polymerase II. This makes sure the LINE copies would be transcribed into RNA for further transposition. The LINE component remains so LINE-binding proteins can recognise the LINE part of the SINE.

====Alu elements====

&quot;Alu&quot;s are the most common SINE in primates. They are approximately 350 base pairs long, do not encode proteins and can be recognized by the restriction enzyme AluI (hence the name). Their distribution may be important in some genetic diseases and cancers. Copy and pasting Alu RNA requires the Alu&#x27;s adenine-rich end and the rest of the sequence bound to a signal. The signal-bound Alu can then associate with ribosomes. LINE RNA associates on the same ribosomes as the Alu. Binding to the same ribosome allows Alus of SINEs to interact with LINE. This simultaneous translation of Alu element and LINE allows SINE copy and pasting.

===SVA elements===
SVA elements are present at lower levels than SINES and LINEs in humans. The starts of SVA and Alu elements are similar, followed by repeats and an end similar to endogenous retrovirus. LINEs bind to sites flanking SVA elements to transpose them. SVA are one of the youngest transposons in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population. SVA was created by a fusion between an Alu element, a VNTR (variable number tandem repeat), and an LTR fragment.

==Role in human disease==
Retrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom. Uncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by RNA interference. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short non-coding RNAs. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.

==Role in evolution==
LTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.

Due to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 – 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution.

Notably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusual genetically as compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.

Mutations caused by retrotransposons include:
* Gene inactivation
* Changing gene regulation
* Changing gene products
* Acting as DNA repair sites

<text>Aspendale is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 27 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Aspendale recorded a population of 7,285 at the .

==Description==

Aspendale is bordered by Port Phillip to the west, Mordialloc and Braeside to the north, Edithvale to the south, and Aspendale Gardens to the east.

Aspendale is bisected by the Nepean Highway and the Frankston line. These provide the main connections to inner Melbourne. On the beach side of the highway, there is more medium density development, and land prices are very high. This area is generally known as Aspendale Beach. Some larger blocks with older houses remain in this area, although many of these larger blocks have been subdivided into flats and units in the past two decades. On the other side of the Nepean Highway, housing is typically low-density, and land values are not as high. The Eastern boundary of Aspendale is the Mordialloc main drain. This area is very picturesque, with eucalypts and a long gravel track that extends from Mordialloc Creek, past the back of St Louis De Montfort&#x27;s School to the Edithvale wetlands. The historic Doyles Bridge Hotel is situated at Number 1, Nepean Highway, Aspendale.

==Facilities==

Recreational facilities in Aspendale include the Rossdale Golf Course and Aspendale Life Saving Club. Other sports clubs include the Aspendale Cricket Club and the St Brigid-St Louis Cricket Club. In conjunction with neighbouring suburb Edithvale, Aspendale has an Australian Rules football team (Edithvale-Aspendale) competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League (the original team of Gerard Healy and Dylan Shiel).

Aspendale is home to two primary schools - St Louis de Montfort Catholic Primary School and Aspendale Primary School; two kindergartens - Aspendale North Kindergarten and Nola Barber Kindergarten; and one secondary school - Mordialloc Secondary College. There was previously also Aspendale Technical School, but this was closed in the 1990s and the land was sold by the State Government to be subdivided as housing.

Aspendale has two churches - St Louis de Montfort Catholic Church and Aspendale Presbyterian Church.

Aspendale has its own train station, which forms part of the Frankston line. There are two small commercial areas in Aspendale, located in Station Street and Laura Street. These take the form of single-sided strip shopping centres.

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation facility at Aspendale houses about 150 staff from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, together with scientific facilities such as a wind tunnel for calibrating anemometers, and laboratories for studying air pollution and climate change.

==History==

Aspendale was occupied by Indigenous Australians for many thousands of years before European settlement. Europeans began farming the area in the 19th century and displaced local inhabitants. When European appropriation began, the land was occupied by the Bunurong people. The geography of the area at the start of European settlement consisted of large sand dune complexes on the coast, and wetland areas inland. The area is flat and low-lying, reaching above sea level by only a few metres.

The geography and ecology of the area has undergone radical changes as a result of European settlement. Much of the wetland area was drained during the second half of the 19th century, with the largest remnants now protected in the Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Ramsar site, part of which lies in Aspendale. Likewise, only modest remnants of the sand dunes exist today near the beach. The beach is a depositary, sandy beach, and the waters remain shallow a long way out. Although no wetland areas remain in Aspendale itself, significant wetland areas have been preserved in the adjacent suburbs of Edithvale and Aspendale Gardens and these areas provide a good indication of what Aspendale once would have looked like. Migratory bird species from all over the world visit these areas.

Aspendale was home to Aspendale Park Racecourse, a horse racing and motor racing track. The suburb&#x27;s name comes from &quot;Aspen&quot;, a successful racehorse. Aspendale train station was built primarily to cater towards the racing crowd in the late part of the 19th century. The racecourse closed in the late 1940s, and nothing remains of it.

Although there are a few older houses nearer the beach, it was in the 1950s, 60s and 70s that Aspendale was extensively subdivided for residential purposes. Today, it is almost entirely residential in character. Houses are typically detached and made of brick. Blocks of land from this era are usually less than a quarter of an acre in size.

Many of the street names acknowledge the area&#x27;s coastal and nautical heritage; e.g. &#x27;Foam&#x27;, &#x27;Longbeach&#x27;, &#x27;Dolphin&#x27;, &#x27;Captain&#x27;, &#x27;Gale&#x27; and &#x27;Anchor&#x27;. Other street names are Aboriginal, e.g. &#x27;Yallambee,&#x27; &#x27;Iluka,&#x27; &#x27;Tarlee,&#x27; &#x27;Nirringa&#x27; and &#x27;Cooinda.&#x27; Other streets were named after racehorses, e.g. &#x27;Marabou,&#x27; &#x27;Lincoln&#x27; and &#x27;Gothic.&#x27;

Aspendale Life Saving Club has a long proud history beginning in 1926 and is currently being rebuilt courtesy of state funding.

Aspendale Post Office opened on 16 December 1908. Aspendale railway station opened in April 1891 as &quot;Aspendale Park Race-Course&quot;, and was renamed &quot;Aspendale&quot; in 1905.

During the late 1950s the Catholic population of Aspendale sought to celebrate Mass locally, initially at Martin’s Dance Hall opposite Aspendale Station. When the hall was sold, Mass was celebrated in the old Scout Hall at Regents Park. In 1961 the current Catholic school and church site was purchased, with the school opening in 1965.

== Climate ==
Aspendale possesses an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb). The town experiences warm summers and cool winters. Average maxima vary from in February to in July, while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July. Precipitation is moderate, averaging per annum. However, rainfall is quite frequent (particularly in winter), as it is spread across 140.4 precipitation days. The town is not sunny, experiencing 120.0 cloudy days and only 34.5 clear days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 24 January 1982 to on 16 June 1969.

==Artistic and Naturalist Heritage==
The ornithologist Archibald James Campbell took a number of nature photographs in Aspendale between 1896 and 1903. In the 1960s, the art dealer and restaurateur Georges Mora had a beachside house in Aspendale which was regularly visited by artists such as Albert Tucker and Sidney Nolan. Art patrons John and Sunday Reed also had a beachhouse in the dunes of Aspendale beach. Their modernist home was designed in 1961 by architect David McGlashan. This role of Aspendale as an artists&#x27; haven was recognised in an exhibition at the Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery in early 2008.

Prior to forming part of the City of Kingston, Aspendale was part of the City of Chelsea and, before that, the Shire of Carrum.

<text>Braeside is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 25 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Braeside recorded a population of 25 at the .

Braeside is a largely industrial suburb with little residential areas.

==History==

Braeside Post Office opened on 15 October 1915 and closed in 1972.

==Today==

Braeside is a primarily industrial suburb bordered on its north by Lower Dandenong Road, on the east by Springvale Road, on the west by Boundary Road and to the south by Mordialloc Creek. On the south it is also bordered by Governor Road becoming Hutton Road towards Keysborough. Beyond these limits there is a new subdivision called Waterways.

Braeside is also known for Braeside Park, a reserve that opened in 1987. It was formerly farmland and owned by the Board of Works. Located on the east side of the proposed Peninsula Freeway, and taking up over half the suburb, Braeside Park has walking/bicycle trails including the Howard Road Trail, Red Gum Trail and the Bayside Trail.

There is also heathland and the Southern Golf Club.

The industrial sector of Braeside has been greatly developed in the past thirty years, with the preponderance of development taking place in the mid-1980s, by converting farmland into small or large factory units. Woodlands Industrial Estate is particularly notable in Braeside. Launched in 1992 and completed in 2003, tenants include Tyco, Wilson, the distribution centre of Kmart, Toro and Gale Pacific. This industrial estate took its name from the gum trees and open area, including the environmental wetlands area close by.

A campus of the Mentone Grammar School is in Braeside, including the Sports Centre with facilities to play soccer, cricket, tennis, field hockey, Australian rules football, and a rifle range. Close to the Sports Centre is the Pot of Colour Garden Nursery, Freccia Azzurra Club for the Italian community of Braeside, and the Croatian-Australian Church and Community Centre. Prominent commercial enterprises on the west of Springvale Road include Gardenworld and J.V. Marine World. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is there as well.

<doc id="617383" wikidata="Q630013" url="?curid=617383" title="Burial at sea">
<text>Burial at sea is the disposal of human remains in the ocean, normally from a ship, boat or aircraft. It is regularly performed by navies, and is done by private citizens in many countries.

Burial-at-sea services are conducted at many different locations and with many different customs, either by ship or by aircraft. Usually, either the captain of the ship or aircraft or a religious representative (of the deceased&#x27;s religion or the state religion) performs the ceremony.

The ceremony may include burial in a casket, burial sewn in sailcloth, burial in an urn, or scattering of the cremated remains from a ship. Burial at sea by aircraft is only done with cremated remains. Other types of burial at sea include the mixing of the ashes with concrete and dropping the concrete block to form an artificial reef such as the Atlantis Reef.

Below is a list of religions that allow burial at sea, with some details of the burial.

==By religion==

===Christianity===
In Christianity, the practice is accepted. It has specific liturgies for burial at sea.

====Catholicism====
Officially, the Roman Catholic Church prefers normal casket burials over cremations, but does allow for burials at sea of whole or cremated remains. The Church defines burial at sea as sinking remains in a worthy container to the sea bottom and final resting place. Burial at sea in a casket or in an urn is acceptable and not prohibited, but viewed as not preferable and should not be commonplace. Cremated remains are subject to the condition that the ashes are entombed in an mausoleum urn niche, columbarium, or buried on land or sea. Catholics believe it is not proper to scatter or pour the cremated remains over the sea, water, or on the land. According to the Roman Catholic Church this action does not give due respect to the remains of the deceased, nor does it allow for the closure, healing of family and friends, and prayers for the deceased. Likewise they see that the custom of housing the remains with family or friends and not placing the deceased in the ground does not offer loved ones a specific and sacred place to visit the deceased&#x27;s remains. Visiting the deceased in a holy place provides believers with a space to offer prayers, commune with those who have gone before them in faith, and reminds them to await the resurrection of their own bodies. For burials at sea, the committal prayer number 406§4 is used in the funeral liturgy.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
At Orthodox funerals, there is normally an open casket at the ceremony. At the grave site, there is a short prayer, after which attendants move to place flowers on the casket. A memorial service is typically held on the Sunday closest to the 40th day after death. Cremation is not approved, as bodies are sought to be preserved in burial as much as is feasible, for preparation of the general resurrection of the dead at the Second Advent.

====Protestantism====
The Anglican Communion allows for burial at sea. Historically, the body has to be sewn in canvas, and suitably weighted. Today, it is more common for the body to be placed in a body bag or if coming from ashore, a coffin. The ship is then stopped and a short religious ceremony is performed. Typically, Protestant funeral rites usually include some form of Bible reading, prayers, a sermon and/or hymns. Exact practices vary by denomination. However, some Protestants do not pray for the dead at all as they state that God has already received the deceased. 

At the burial of the dead at sea, the same office from the Book of Common Prayer as used for burial on land may be used; only instead of the words:

the form of words used is:

Anglican, and other, chaplains of the Royal Navy also bury cremated remains of deceased naval personnel at sea. Scattering of cremated remains of those who have served in the Navy is allowed under the direction of the Chaplaincy services in three designated port areas and carries no charge.

Many Lutheran naval veterans and seamen prefer to be buried at sea. In those cases either the casket or urn is set to sea, or ashes scattered. The procedure is similar as that with the Anglican church. Some parishes have specific consecrated sea areas that are designated by a bishop as a sea area where ashes can be sprinkled.

===Hinduism===
In traditional Hindu funerary practice bodies of water serve as the primary place of deposition for human remains, and their shores may also be the location for other parts of the funerary rituals, including the cremation. The deceased are traditionally cremated on a pyre accompanied by a variety of items, including flowers, herbs, oils and holy river water. The cremation serves as a final sacrifice of the body. The soul escapes the confines of the body when the heat of the fire makes the skull crack, and the body is then remade in the ancestral realm. After the fire has burned down, the ashes are collected, and immersed in a sacred river, ideally the Ganges. Death causes a ritual pollution among the attendants of the funeral, who wash themselves in the sacred river after the dispersion of the ashes.

===Islam===
The sacred texts of Islam prefer burial on land, &quot;so deep that its smell does not come out and the beasts of prey do not dig it out&quot;. However, if a person dies at sea and it is not possible to bring the body back to land before decay, or if burial at land becomes impossible, burial at sea is allowed. A weight is tied to the feet of the body, and the body is lowered into the water. This would preferably occur in an area where the remains are not immediately eaten by scavengers.

In the Sunni Fiqh book &quot;Umdat al-Salik wa Uddat al-Nasik&quot;, the condition for sea burial is:

===Judaism===
According to Jewish law, dead people must be quickly buried, and burial requires covering in earth. This law is derived from Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:23 &quot;Bury, you will bury him the same day; for the (unburied body) is a curse to God&quot; the double command to bury causing a positive commandment to entomb in the earth and a negative commandment forbidding leaving an unburied body. The legal text &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; brings a case example explaining that even if a person is known to have drowned in a closed body of water such as a small pond where there can be certainty that the victim had not somehow survived, the family does not begin ritual mourning and remains in extended state of most intense mourning aninut until either the body is found or after an exhaustive search despairs of recovering and burying the body. This shows that the body is considered unburied when underwater; as shiva mourning normally only begins after burial. B&#x27;resheit (Genesis) 3:19 states &quot;With the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground, from (dust) you were taken and you are dust, and to dust you will return.&quot; From this it has been deduced by rabbis that the only proper treatment of a dead body is physically to cover it with earth once land is available for the crew to bury the body, rather than to leave the body at sea or some other fate such as cremation.

If for some reason a deceased body aboard a ship would cause an immediate life threat to those aboard the vessel, the commandment to protect innocent life (pikuach nefesh) overrides nearly all other commandments, including the command to bury the dead. Any appropriate actions to ensure the safety of surviving crew are required to be taken, which may include jettisoning a body at sea without burial. However, attempts would later be made to recover and bury when possible without life hazard.

An example of the desire to bury a body in the ground, even after it has been long dead at sea, is seen in the case of the Israeli submarine &quot;Dakar&quot;. The submarine was lost with no survivors in 1968, and its location was not discovered until 1999, when it was found to be lying broken at a depth of 3,000 meters. Search and recovery of any potentially existing remains at this very difficult-to-access depth has not shown results, despite requests from family and the Chief Rabbi of the Israel Defense Forces. In another case, when the skeletons of Holocaust victims were found in a river into which they had been dumped en masse, authorities claimed that many of these martyrs to the Jewish faith would hope to be brought ashore to rest in proper Jewish burials.

==By country==

===Australia===
Burial at sea within Australian territorial waters, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf is covered by the &quot;Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981&quot; administered by the federal Department of the Environment. A permit is required for burial of bodies at sea. Permits are usually only granted in cases of a strong connection to the sea, such as long-serving navy personnel. The body must not be embalmed or placed in a casket; it may only be sewn into a shroud. The burial must be in water deeper than and not interfere with shipping, fishing or undersea communications. Australian Defence Force vessels engaged in armed conflicts or emergency situations are exempt from these requirements.

No permit is required to scatter ashes at sea.

===United Kingdom===
British burials at sea of the 18th and 19th century involved wrapping the deceased in sailcloth weighted with cannonballs.

In England, cremated remains may be scattered freely at sea but a burial must be made in a coffin meeting regulatory requirements and in one of three locations: off The Needles, Isle of Wight; between Hastings and Newhaven; and off Tynemouth, North Tyneside. Permission may be sought for another burial site. Some funeral directors will arrange the event, such as Britannia Shipping for Burial At Sea. Charity organisation the Maritime Volunteer Service also helps carry out burials at sea.

In Scotland, there are two designated sites for burial at sea. These are due west of Oban and west of John O&#x27;Groats.

===United States===
A funeral director is not required for the burial of cremated remains at sea. However, full body burials require specific preparation to ensure the body or coffin sinks quickly, and in many states a licensed funeral director is required. The Environmental Protection Agency regulations for full body burials at sea in the United States require that the site of interment be from land and at a depth of at least . In certain areas, specifically east central Florida, the Dry Tortugas, Florida and west of Pensacola, Florida to the Mississippi River Delta, such at-sea burials are only authorized in ocean waters at least 1,800 feet (549 m) deep. In California, a whole body must be buried at least three miles off the coast. Off the eastern coast of the United States, the closest sufficient depths are off Long Island (), Ocracoke (), and Miami (). This may require travel in excess of for a suitable site.

Departing from the New England area requires a voyage of about to reach the required 600 ft ocean depth. Sufficient depth is within or less at many harbors along the U.S. west coast, including San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterey, Fort Bragg, Eureka, and Crescent City, all in California. The United States Navy inters intact remains from Norfolk and San Diego only. The United States Navy requires a metal casket for intact remains, but full-body burial in a suitably weighted shroud is also legal.

The United States is similar to many countries which permit the spreading of cremation ashes within their Exclusive Economic zone. When spreading ashes from a ship which is registered in a different country, the regulations and reporting procedures for the ship&#x27;s flag state need to be complied with once the vessel is in international waters, that is, outside . Ships follow the London Convention principles, as opposed to MARPOL regulations, as the ash is intentionally taken on board for discharge at sea, as opposed to ash generated on passage from the ship&#x27;s incinerators. It should be further considered that on 1 January 2013, MARPOL Annex V came into force, which prevents discharge of a ship&#x27;s incinerator ash.

====United States Navy====
The United States Navy has performed many burials at sea in its history, with wartime burials as recently as World War II, and peacetime burials still common. Enemy deaths received the same ceremony as Americans or allies. Most other armed forces also perform burials at sea, such as the British Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy.

If the deceased died on land or has been returned to shore after death, the remains may be brought aboard either in a coffin or in an urn after cremation. The ceremony is performed while the ship is deployed, and consequently civilians are not allowed to be present. In the US, people eligible for a Navy burial at sea are:
* Active-duty members of the uniformed services
* Retirees and honorably discharged veterans
* Military Sealift Command US civilian marine personnel
* Dependents of active duty members, retirees, and veterans.

In preparation, the officer of the deck calls &quot;All hands bury the dead&quot;, and the ship is stopped (if possible). The ship&#x27;s flags are lowered to half mast. The ship&#x27;s crew, including a firing party, casket bearers and a bugler, are assembled on the deck. The crew stands at parade rest at the beginning of the ceremony. The coffin is covered with a flag, and is carried feet first on deck by the casket bearers. The casket is placed on a stand, with the feet overboard. In case of cremated remains, the urn is brought on deck and placed on a stand.

The ceremony is divided into a military portion and a religious portion. The religious part is specific to the religion of the deceased, and may be performed by a Navy chaplain, or by the commanding officer if no chaplain of the appropriate faith is available. A scripture is read and prayers are said.

After the religious ceremony, the firing party is ordered &quot;Firing party, present arms&quot;. The casket bearers tilt the platform with the casket, so that the casket slides off the platform into the ocean. The flag which was draped over the casket is retained on board. For cremated remains, there is the option to bury the remains using the urn in a similar fashion to the procedure used for caskets. Alternatively, the urn can be opened, and the remains scattered in the wind. In this case, the wind direction has to be taken under consideration before burial to ensure a smooth procedure.

The firing party fires a three volley salute, the bugler plays &quot;Taps&quot;, and flowers may also be dropped into the ocean. After the flag is folded, the ceremony ends. The relatives are informed of the time and location of the burial, and given photos and video recordings if available.

==Wartime burial at sea==

In wartime, attempts are made for burial at sea to follow the same procedure as for peacetime burial at sea, although a ship on a combat mission may not have all the necessary resources available. Nowadays, it is usually possible to airlift the remains back to shore, and prepare a burial ceremony on land. However, as recently as the Falklands War, deceased were buried at sea without returning to land. Due to the limited facilities of military ships, this procedure usually does not include a casket, but the body is sewn into a sailcloth with weights, usually rocks or cannonballs. Cremation is usually not possible on a ship. During the Pacific campaign there was at least one instance where a member of an aircrew was buried at sea in his damaged aircraft, which was ceremonially pushed overboard from an aircraft carrier.

==Memorial services at sea==
If no remains of the deceased are available a memorial service may be held, and flowers may be dropped in the water, often over or near the location of the death.

==People buried at sea==
A few notable burials at sea:
* Sir Francis Drake (1540–1596), body in lead coffin off the coast of Portobelo, Panama
* Christopher Newport (1561–1617), body buried in the Indian Ocean
* Edward Winslow (1595–1655), buried at sea near Jamaica on 8 May 1655
* Mariano Moreno (1778–1811), one of the leaders of the Argentine May Revolution; died on a schooner taking him to exile in Europe; his coffin was wrapped in a Union Jack.
* Friedrich Engels (1820–1895), cremated ashes were scattered off Beachy Head, near Eastbourne England. 
* Numerous victims (1912), picked up by rescue ships, whose remains were too damaged to preserve or for whom the rescuers lacked sufficient embalming materials, were buried at sea. The ashes of Titanic&#x27;s fourth officer, Joseph Boxhall, were scattered at sea following his death, aged 83, in 1967, at 41°46N 50°14W, the position he had calculated for the ship on the night of the sinking.
* Surya Sen (1894–1934), was given a burial at sea in the Bay of Bengal
* Dudley Pound (1877–1943), cremated ashes scattered

* Adolf Eichmann (1906–1962), following his execution in Israel, his body was cremated and his ashes scattered at sea over the Mediterranean, in international waters. This was done because Israel did not want such a person buried in its soil, and also did not want a grave elsewhere that might have become a place of pilgrimage for other Nazis.
* Jenny Cheok Cheng Kid (1941–1963), Singaporean murder victim who had gone missing at sea on 27 August 1963 during a scuba diving trip near Sisters&#x27; Islands, Singapore. She was later found to be murdered by her boyfriend Sunny Ang for her insurance, which amounted to $450,000. Despite the lack of a body and circumstantial evidence, Ang was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in one of Singapore&#x27;s sensational trials, and later executed in 1967. Her body has never been found and is presumed buried at sea.

<text>Carrum is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Carrum recorded a population of 4,239 at the .

==History==

The suburb of Carrum is located on what was originally part of the Carrum Carrum Swamp. The Carrum Carrum Swamp was drained in 1879 when the Patterson Cut (formed in 1876), and other drainage measures were undertaken to prevent flooding of the Eumemmering Creek, which overflowed into the Carrum Carrum Swamp. The swamp opening was mostly only open during the Winter months, so heavy Spring and Summer rains often caused flooding to properties on the edge of the swamp area. It also often caused flood damage as far north as Edithvale. The only remnants of the Carrum Carrum Swamp now form the Ramsar-listed Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands.

Old Carrum had a proud horse-racing legacy, with stables located in Valetta Street and Tennyson Street belonging to trainers, including Robbie Laing, who is currently training Stars of Carrum.

Carrum has its own railway station which opened in 1882, being the first Railway Station between Mordialloc and Frankston. Carrum Post Office opened on 1 February 1886, some time after the railway.

In 1924 the Carrum Bowling Club was founded; in 1925 the Carrum Surf Life Saving Club was founded; in 1946 the Patterson River Motor Boat Club was founded at the original site of the Carrum Life Saving Club, which relocated to a new site 400 metres south; and in 1966 the Carrum Sailing Club was founded.

==Sport==
===Cricket===
The Carrum Cricket Club was established in 1978 with its home ground in the heart of Carrum, in Graham Rd. The cricket club has won 16 senior Premierships since, initially in the FDCA and more recently in the Mornington Peninsula Cricket Association (MPCA). The club&#x27;s president is Josh Dent, who is also the most recent 1st XI premiership captain, winning the MPCA Sub-District division in 2017/2018. The club has had two state representatives, with Jackson Fry and Lachy Dobson representing the Victorian Country XI.

The club currently fields junior cricket sides in the MPCA with U10s, U12s, U14s, U16s and a girls side. Cricket Australia&#x27;s Woolworths blast program is also held frequently by the club, with the aim being to create and manage a grassroots level of cricket for Primary School players.

===Football===
Carrum Football Club had a proud history from 1911 until it folded due to financial issues in 1996. The Carrum Lions club colours were originally blue and gold, players wore a blue jumper with a gold yolk, this was later change to the Fitzroy Maroon and Blue with a CFC and a Lion on the Jersey. At the same time the club song was changed from the original – &quot;Blue and Gold, Blue and Gold, we will be premiers and you will be told. At the end of the season, we will show you the reason, why Carrum&#x27;s on top of them all&quot; – to the song &quot;It&#x27;s a grand old Flag&quot; used commonly by the Melbourne Demons.

Carrum Football Club competed in the various forms of local leagues including the Federal League as Chelsea – Carrum until 1914 when carrum went alone. The Carrum Lions won their first Premiership in the Federal League in 1921. They later joined the Peninsula District and later the Mornington Peninsula Football League and finally the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League where they won their Final Premiership in Division 2 in 1994.

Despite folding in 1996, key community members headed by Mark Bollen came together in 2013 and produced a Grand Final contending side in its first year back. The team also managed to field a Reserves and Under 19&#x27;s side in 2014.

<text>Ceratodontidae is an extinct family of lungfish with fossils known worldwide from the earliest Triassic to the Eocene. 

== Taxonomy ==
Although the extant Queensland lungfish was formerly also classified in this family due to its similar appearance, phylogenetic and morphological evidence indicates that it belongs in a different family, Neoceratodontidae. A morphological study by Kemp &quot;et al&quot; (2017) proposed that Ceratodontidae was more closely related to modern African (Protopteridae) and South American lungfish (Leptosirenidae) than Queensland lungfish. However, Brownstein, Harrington &amp; Near (2023) found Ceratodontidae to lie outside the crown group of modern lungfish, with all modern lungfish more closely related to each other than to Ceratodontidae.

== Genera ==
The following genera are known from the family:

* †&quot;Arganodus&quot; (alternatively placed in own family, Arganodontidae)
* †&quot;Ariguna&quot;
* †&quot;Ceratodus&quot; 
* †&quot;Epiceratodus&quot;
* †&quot;Lupaceratodus&quot; Galula Formation, Tanzania, Cretaceous
* †&quot;Metaceratodus&quot;
* †&quot;Microceratodus&quot; (?)
* †&quot;Potamoceratodus&quot;
* †&quot;Tellerodus&quot;
* †&quot;Retodus&quot;
&quot;Paraceratodus&quot; was also classified in this family but phylogenetic evidence supports it being the most basal member of Ceratodontoidei.

<text>Clarinda is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 18 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Clarinda recorded a population of 7,441 at the .

==History==

The area was once coastal heathland and first occupied by John O&#x27;Shannessy during the early 1840s, who took a squatting licence to encompass a block, around suburbs known today as Clarinda, Clayton South, Dingley and Heatherton. O&#x27;Shannessy later passed on his licence to John and Richard King in 1846, which saw the transformation of the area.

In May 1905, Brighton Council advised it had received an offer from the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works that it was prepared to lay an extension of the Glenhuntly Road water main into Clarinda Road with the view of opening up &#x27;little populated localities&#x27;.

In June 1905, Moorabbin Council called for estimates to form and gravel 20 chains of Clarinda Road from Bunny Road, requesting the owners in the meantime to clear off &#x27;furze&#x27;.

The 6 July 1907 edition of the Brighton Southern Cross newspaper carried an advertisement from a florist named Curtis seeking an employee to work in Clarinda Road, Bald Hills, Clayton.

The area was originally called Bald Hills but because there were many places of the same name, it was changed to Bayview then later Clarinda.

The Moorabbin Council voted to support the construction of Clarinda Road at a meeting in April 1908. It noted it was the only through road between Heatherton and Bald Hills. It was proposed to source gravel for the project from nearby Robertson&#x27;s Estate. Ratepayers had agreed to work valued at £30 and had already undertaken preparatory work themselves. In July the council agreed with an engineer&#x27;s report recommending Clarinda Road be gravelled for a distance of four chains, and concurred the area should then be &#x27;left alone for a little while&#x27;.

Clarinda Post Office opened on 13 September 1911 and closed in 1971. When the suburb was developed it reopened in 1984.

Clarinda is now a multicultural suburb with existing communities from the Philippines, India, Greece, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.

<text>Edithvale is a beachside suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 28 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Edithvale recorded a population of 6,276 at the .

==History==

Edithvale Post Office opened on 20 April 1923.

==Public transport==

Edithvale railway station on the Frankston line services the area. Edithvale is also on the Route 902 SmartBus orbital between Airport West and Chelsea. It is also served by the occasional Route 706 to Mordialloc.

In 2021 the Edithvale Train Station was rebuilt as part of the Victoria State Government&#x27;s removal of Edithvale Road level crossing.

==Edithvale Primary School==

Edithvale Primary School has a long history, originally being a wooden building which was burnt down in 1930 and took over 40 fireman to get ride of the huge fire. And is now rebuilt in red brick as it is today. During the 1960s it was the largest school in the area with over 1000 students. Notable students include Victorian State MP Louise Asher and Federal MP Greg Wilton.

==Edithvale Beach==

Edithvale is best known for its long beach of pure white sand and historic bathing boxes. Residents groups have set up the Kingston Boatshed Association to protect these historic treasures, originally constructed by their owners for family activities such as swimming and fishing. The waters of Port Phillip Bay provide an excellent reflection as the sun sets directly facing the shore.

Today large houses are being built on the absolute beach frontages which are highly sought after. Pre-war this area was popular with Melbourne city residents who caught the train down on a hot Sunday and swam at Edithvale lifesaving club with its pier.

Commonly caught fish in the area include Flathead and Garfish, as well as Flounder which can be taken with a hand spear. Dolphins have been seen swimming 100 metres from shore and small fish fingerlings breed in the shallows.

The beach, which was originally ultra pure fine white sand has been degraded by coarser sand washed ashore during attempts to reclaim the beach further north at Aspendale in the late 1970s. This reclamation involved pumping sand onto the eroding beach from far offshore. Unfortunately this off shore sand was much coarser and yellower being harder and grittier. It&#x27;s clear today to see the progressive spread of this course sand now 3 km south of its original location. Other changes to the beach include the installation of sewerage to beach front properties in the 1960s when the entire dune was bulldozed, removing all native vegetation and razing what was once a protective mound. Introduced grasses were planted to hold the sand together and this eventually spread down to near the waters edge, producing what is seen today as a creeping sand dune covering the original beach with grass.

Edithvale beach is also famous as the home of John Bertrand, skipper of the Americas Cup winning Yacht Australia II, he learnt his seamanship skills at Chelsea Yacht Club sailing on the unpredictable Port Phillip Bay.

==Sport==

The town in conjunction with neighbouring suburb Aspendale has an Australian Rules football Edithvale-Aspendale team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League.

Golfers play at the Australasian Golf Club&#x27;s Chelsea Public Golf Course on Fraser Avenue.

==Environment==

Edithvale is particularly well known for its long white sand beach which is a popular tourist attraction during summer. The beach is part of Port Phillip Bay.

Part of the Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Ramsar Site lies within Edithvale, providing opportunities for birdwatching and environmental education as well as walking and bicycle tracks.

<text>Mentone is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 21 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Mentone recorded a population of 13,197 at the .

It is known locally for Mentone Beach, which extends alongside Beaumaris Bay from the cliffs in Beaumaris and ends at Warrigal Road where it meets Parkdale.

Mentone is associated with the Heidelberg School of Australian artists.

==History==
Mentone was founded as a resort town named after the Italian spelling of the formerly-Italian French town Menton. In order to keep with the Italian resort theme many streets in Mentone were named after Italian cities for example, Cremona Street, Florence Street, Venice Street and Milan Street and Naples street

The development of Mentone began in the late 1800s, the Post Office opening on 16 May 1884.

Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin were painting on the beach at Mentone one day in the summer of 1886-87 when they noticed a young man painting nearby. This was Arthur Streeton who they asked to join them. They, and others, later became known as the Heidelberg school of artists.

The original Mentone Fire station was located on the corner of Brindisi Street and Mentone Parade, Mentone in 1906 and after the new fire station was built it was relocated to Lalor in 1957.

==Shopping==

Mentone is home to a lively shopping area along Como Parade West, Balcombe Road, Mentone Parade and surrounding streets and laneways. This shopping strip offers a wide range of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, clothing stores, supermarkets, travel agents, fancy dress, craft, home, book stores and more. A second commercial area has grown along Nepean Highway; this may expand as the former Nylex factory site between Nepean Highway and Warrigal road is redeveloped into a bulky goods retail precinct.

Neighbouring suburb, Cheltenham, comprises one of the biggest shopping centres in Australia – Westfield Southland. This shopping mall incorporates a two-level bridge that spans the six lanes of Nepean Highway. It is the main shopping centre for people of Mentone and surrounds. A new train station opened in 2017 on the west side of Southland near Bay Street.

In late 2010, Thrift Park shopping centre between Lower Dandenong Road and Nepean Highway just east of Warrigal Road went through with a $35-million redevelopment. The redevelopment included demolishing the original centre that was &quot;ageing&quot; and building a larger Woolworths supermarket plus additional stores. The centre officially opened in December 2010.

==Politics==

In terms of state and federal government Mentone is situated in the Electoral district of Mordialloc and Sandringham for state parliament and the Electoral district of Isaacs in the federal system. In the 2018 Victorian State election and the 2019 Australian Federal Election, every booth in Mentone reported a majority of votes for the Labor Party.


==Transport==

Mentone is located on the Nepean Highway. Mentone is serviced by a variety of Public Transport Victoria buses, which are the 903 bus from Mordialloc, 811 and 812 from Brighton and Dandenong, The 708 to Hampton and Carrum and the 825 and Metro Trains Melbourne services, focused on the Mentone railway station, a station on the Frankston train line. The station opened on 19 December 1881 as Balcombe Road.

A new railway station was built at Mentone in 2020 as part of the Victorian government’s removal of the level crossing previously on Balcombe Road.

==Entertainment and leisure==

The Mentone Beach and Mentone Lifesaving Club provide leisure space and activities, as do the parkland and oval near the council offices. Mentone is also home to numerous sporting clubs including cricket, football, tennis, swimming, field hockey, and lawn bowling.

Mentone Bowling Club was established in the early 1900s. The club is next to the train station in the centre of the suburb. Mentone were promoted to the Premier Division in 2010.

In late 2013 it was announced the iconic Mentone Tenpin Bowl on the corner of the Nepean Hwy and Warrigal Rd would close by the end of that year after fifty years of operation in order to make way for a new multi-storey residential apartment and retail complex.

The Mentone Hotel was a historical hotel building overlooking Port Phillip Bay. It has been renovated into a number of apartments. The Mentone RSL is housed in a building dating to 1884–1886.

One of Australia&#x27;s last Blockbuster Video stores was in Mentone but has since closed down.

<text>Moorabbin is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 15 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Kingston local government area. Moorabbin recorded a population of 6,287 at the .

Most of the eastern side of Moorabbin has been an industrial area since the first development in the mid-1960s. Major businesses with a presence in the area include Coca-Cola. Moorabbin is also well known locally for its residential area built after World War II.

==History==
The word &quot;Moorabbin&quot; is believed to have come from the Aboriginal word moorooboon meaning &quot;mother&#x27;s milk&quot;, as it was purportedly a place where women and children stayed and rested while the men hunted further afield.

In 1846, the first European settlers arrived, brothers John and Richard King, who are thought to have come from the Western Port area.

The Post Office opened on 1 September 1857 as South Brighton, was renamed Brighton South around 1886 and Moorabbin in 1909. The Moorabbin East Post Office near Chesterville Road opened in 1960.

The seat of local government moved from Moorabbin to Cheltenham when the former City of Moorabbin was incorporated into the larger City of Kingston.

In August 1998, Moorabbin was the scene of the Silk-Miller police murders.

==Transport==

While by name &quot;Moorabbin&quot; would appear to be home to the regional general airport Moorabbin Airport, the airport, also called the Harry Hawker Airport, is its own suburb, sharing the postcode of 3194 with Mentone. Moorabbin is serviced by a variety of Public Transport Victoria bus and train services including Moorabbin station.

==Housing==

Housing in Moorabbin comprises mainly 3-bedroom red or cream brick detached houses built between the 1940s and 1970s. More recently villa units and townhouses have been built.

==Notable places in Moorabbin==
The Moorabbin Campus of the Holmesglen Institute of TAFE is located in Moorabbin, the campus formerly belonging to the Chisholm Institute and before that was the location of Moorabbin Technical College. Moorabbin has two public primary schools (Moorabbin Primary, Southmoor Primary) and one Catholic primary (St. Catherine&#x27;s Primary).

Moorabbin High School closed in 1984 but the former campus is now being used by the Bayside Special Development School, which provides individual programs for children with special needs. The Gould League also uses the former Moorabbin High School site and specialises in education that relates to the environment and sustainability.

==Sport==

The suburb has an Australian Rules football team, Moorabbin Kangaroos Football Club, competing in the Southern Football League.

The football and cricket venue in the suburb is Moorabbin Oval, located in Linton Street. The ground was used by the St Kilda Football Club in VFL/AFL games between 1965 and 1992, and continued to serve as its training and administrative home ground until 2010. From 2018 the ground has again become the training, entertainment, member and community base for the Saints.

The former Australian Touring Car Championship team Perkins Engineering was based at Moorabbin Airport.

By 1946, Essendon Airport was Australia&#x27;s busiest airport and Melbourne&#x27;s only public airport, but was becoming congested even before expansion plans for Essendon were announced. Funding for the construction of a secondary airport was announced by Prime Minister Ben Chifley on 6 November 1946.
The control tower opened on 15 December 1949 for training. Originally the intent was to name the airport &quot;Mentone&quot; but this was abandoned after a potential clash with the then French airport in Menton. Similarly, Cheltenham was discarded due to similarities to the Gloucestershire Airport near Cheltenham in South West England. The name comes from City of Moorabbin, the municipality in which it was then situated.

The control tower opened on 15 December 1949 and flying commenced on 31 December.

The airport was renamed to Moorabbin (Harry Hawker) Airport on 22 January 1989, after pioneering Australian aviator Harry George Hawker, on the centenary date of Hawker&#x27;s birth.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 3 April 1953, an Avro Anson plane crash landed at the airport. The five-man crew escaped unharmed.
* On 19 October 1970, a Beech D50B light aircraft collided mid-air with a Bell 47G-3B-2 helicopter over the suburb of Moorabbin while on approach to Moorabbin airport. Both aircraft subsequently crashed to the ground and burst into flames. All 5 on board the two aircraft died in the crash.
* On 14 February 1995, a Hughes 300 helicopter crashed into Port Phillip Bay near Aspendale during a ferry flight from Geelong to Moorabbin airport for repairs. The tail boom failed in flight causing loss of control and subsequent crash into the shallow waters near the beach. The sole occupant, the pilot, died in the crash.
* On 18 March 2000, a Cessna 210E performed a ditching into a quarry in Heatherton, near Moorabbin Airport after experiencing a loss of performance. The aircraft had been performing an evaluation flight near the airport when it experienced difficulties. The pilot and both passengers evacuated the aircraft safely, however one passenger drowned before reaching land due to being unable to swim.
* On 29 July 2002, two Cessna 172Rs collided while on short final landing approach at Moorabbin airport following night circuit training. Both aircraft became entangled and crashed on the runway with subsequent fires. Both occupants from one aircraft evacuated safely, however the sole occupant of the other aircraft died in the crash.
* On 27 August 2008, a Cessna 150M was involved in a mid-air collision with a Piper PA-28 Cherokee near Moorabbin airport during training flights. Immediately upon the collision, the Cessna lost control and crashed into a garage in the suburb of Cheltenham bursting into flames and causing fatal injuries to the pilot, the sole occupant. The Piper was able to limp back to the airport where both occupants escaped injuries.
* On 7 August 2010, a Cessna 152 was involved in a serious incident after crashing into a backyard of a home in Mordialloc while on approach to nearby Moorabbin airport. The aircraft&#x27;s engine failed as a result of fuel starvation. Both occupants escaped with only minor injuries and the aircraft was written off after sustaining major damage.
* On 11 August 2015, a Cessna 172 (VH-EUU) and a Piper PA-28 (VH-TXH) collided on the ground after TXH had a rough running engine and landed on Runway 22/04, After touchdown, the pilot of TXH decided they would not be able to stop on the runway and began to overshoot onto the grass and onto taxiway Alfa where EUU was taxiing. EUU was advised to stop by the Surface Movement Control (SMC) (Ground Control) but elected to continue to avoid a direct collision with TXH. TXH veered right in an attempt to avoid EUU; however, the left wing of TXH collided with the tail of EUU. The pilot of TXH was not injured. The pilot and passengers of EUU were treated for minor injuries. Both aircraft sustained substantial damage.
* On 8 June 2018, a pilot of a light plane, Cessna 172 (VH-EWE), died when his plane crashed and burst into flames in a street in Mordialloc, on short final for runway 35L. ATC recordings indicated he had an engine failure on approach, an ATSB report has been unable to find a cause behind this accident.
* On 30 November 2022, a Hughes 269C helicopter crashed into a residential structure in Mentone. The sole student pilot was seriously injured.

== Facilities ==
Moorabbin Airport, one of four in the city, serves the general aviation needs for the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It has five intersecting runways, the longest being Runway 17L/35R with a length of . Usually, two parallel runways are used at the same time. The airport also has a control tower. The airport is home to the Royal Victorian Aero Club, the Australian National Aviation Museum and several flight training facilities, including a campus of multinational pilot training organization CAE Oxford Aviation Academy.

== Airlines and destinations ==


== Master plan ==
The master plan for Moorabbin Airport was approved by the federal Minister for Infrastructure Anthony Albanese MP, on 25 June 2010. The master plan provides a twenty-year horizon detailing the development of the airport and associated infrastructure.

A draft Major Development Plan for Moorabbin Airport drawn up by the Australian company Wesfarmers was refused by Albanese, on 5 August 2013. The draft plan was for the development of large retail outlets on 4.8 hectares of airport land at the corner of Centre Dandenong Road and Boundary Road. The proposal had a floor area of 14,500m2.

<doc id="617411" wikidata="Q1485336" url="?curid=617411" title="GFA BASIC">
<text>GFA BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language, by Frank Ostrowski. The name is derived from the company (&quot;GFA Systemtechnik GmbH&quot;), which distributed the software. In the mid-1980s to the 1990s it enjoyed popularity as an advanced BASIC dialect, but has been mostly superseded by several other programming languages. Official support ended in the early 2000s.

==History==
GFA BASIC was developed by Frank Ostrowski at &quot;GFA Systemtechnik GmbH&quot; (later &quot;GFA Software&quot;), a German company in Kiel and Düsseldorf, as a proprietary version of his free BASIC implementation, Turbo-Basic XL. GFA is an acronym for &quot;Gesellschaft für Automatisierung&quot; (&quot;Company for Automation&quot;), which gave name to the software. The first GFA BASIC version was released in 1986. In the mid and late 1980s it became very popular for the Atari ST home computer range, since the Atari ST BASIC shipped with them was more primitive. Later, ports for the Commodore Amiga, DOS and Windows were marketed. Version 2.0 was the most popular release of GFA BASIC as it offered then many more advanced features compared to alternatives. GFA BASIC 3.0 included further improvements like support for user-defined structures and other agglomerated data types. The final released version was 3.6. Around 2002 GFA software ceased all GFA BASIC activities and shut down the mailinglist and website in 2005. Due to official support of GFA BASIC having ceased the user community took over the support and installed an own communication infrastructure.

== Features and functionality ==
As of version 2.0, the most popular release, GFA BASIC was a very modern programming language for its time. Line numbers were not used and one line was equivalent to one command. To greatly simplify maintenance of long listings, the IDE later even allowed for code folding. It had a reasonable range of structured programming commands — procedures with local variables and parameter passing by value or reference, loop constructs, etc. Modularization was only rudimentary, making GFA BASIC 2.0 best suited for small and medium-sized projects.

The GFA BASIC interpreter is compact and reasonably fast, and was shipped with a runtime that could be distributed freely with one&#x27;s programs. When a compiler was made available, execution speed could be increased by approximately a factor of 2. GFA BASIC allowed extreme optimisations for execution speed, supporting some direct assembler-level calls, and even the ability to embed sections of assembler code directly within the BASIC source code. GFA BASIC integrated neatly into GEM and TOS, the Atari ST&#x27;s operating system, providing menus, dialog boxes, and mouse control. (See WIMP interface.)

Although the source code was usually stored in a tokenized version to save room on disk, pieces of code could also be saved in ASCII form, and as such made it possible to set up reusable libraries. The tokenized source files were a benefit in other ways too — for instance, GFA BASIC allowed users to include binary data in their BASIC code via an &quot;INLINE&quot; statement, and could even be integrated with the GFA Assembler to allow users to develop machine code programs inside INLINE statements in order to accelerate particular areas of a program. It also meant that the BASIC interpreter (and later the compiler) didn&#x27;t need to tokenise a program when it was loaded, which would have been a significant load-time overhead for some of the larger GFA BASIC programs that were written.

===Manual===
Some editions of the GFA manual were printed with black ink on red paper, in an attempt to thwart photocopying and bootlegging. The effectiveness of this tactic was questionable, and the manual returned to the usual black-on-white format after complaints from colour blind users and the proliferation of re-typed copies on the Internet.

== Windows version ==
GFA BASIC for Microsoft Windows included a thorough implementation of the Windows API calls. Although the product had a number of technical advantages over some of the more popular products (the combination of an &quot;easy&quot; language with robust architecture and fast, compiled, reliable code), it didn&#x27;t achieve great success in the Windows market. Software professionals who wanted high-performance code tended to stay with the more &quot;technical&quot; languages, and to regard BASICs as inferior. For professionals who didn&#x27;t have a problem with BASIC, a number of well-established software tool vendors such as Microsoft and Borland were actively promoting new &quot;visual&quot; programming systems such as Visual Basic. These allowed users to create windows and dialog boxes populated by standard components (text, buttons, frame outlines) with the help of a drag-and-drop interface and object-oriented editing.

One of the advantages of GFA BASIC for Windows was that the compiler (sold separately) could create stand-alone .exe files, and also included a relatively easy option for creating Dynamic Link Library (.DLL) files for Windows. This allowed a user to write and test routines within GFA Basic, export them as functions to a Windows .DLL file, and then access those pre-compiled functions from within other tools or programs, such as Visual Basic 3.0, which was unable to produce compiled code. This feature allowed GFA BASIC to be used as a &quot;number-crunching&quot; add-on product for Visual Basic, for writing high-speed routines for applications such as database sorting or media signal processing that would have been impractical under the then-current version of Visual Basic.

In the United States at least, GFA BASIC did not have the same brand recognition enjoyed by products from companies such as Microsoft and Borland. As a simple text-based code creation system, it also lacked the exciting new &quot;visual&quot; user interfaces of its better-known competitors. Although GFA BASIC for Windows was developed further to include support for Visual Basic&#x27;s components, their use under GFA was more technical than under Visual Basic. Without a large marketing budget, or a clear reason why journalists should write about it, GFA BASIC for Windows remained a comparatively obscure product.

== Applications ==
Éric Chahi wrote a game editor in GFA basic to create his game &quot;Another World&quot;, including scene design and game scripting; only the game engine (polygon rendering and music) was done in assembler. This editor was used to make all ports of the game, including for consoles and the Collector Edition for Windows released in 2006. 

Karsten Köper of Thalion software wrote all the basic game editing software for the &quot;Amberstar&quot; series using GFA Basic.

The Dashboard of Sustainability is coded mostly in GFA Basic. The source is about 500kB, plus about 100kB of assembly mainly for accessing 32-bit Windows functions.

<text>Edward Granville Theodore (29 December 1884 – 9 February 1950) was an Australian politician who served as Premier of Queensland from 1919 to 1925, as leader of the state Labor Party. He later entered federal politics, serving as Treasurer in the Scullin Labor government.

Theodore was born in Adelaide, the son of a Romanian immigrant. He left school at the age of 12, and spent the next decade working his way around the country. He arrived in Queensland in 1906, and soon became involved in the labour movement. Theodore was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly in 1909, aged just 24. He was also elected state president of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union in 1913. Theodore became Treasurer of Queensland following Labor&#x27;s victory at the 1915 state election.

In 1919, Theodore succeeded T. J. Ryan as premier. His government pursued various interventionist economic policies, establishing a number of state-run enterprises and introducing new competition and labour market regulations. These perceived steps towards socialism led to Theodore being nicknamed &quot;Red Ted&quot;. A notable constitutional reform was the abolition of the Queensland Legislative Council in 1922; Queensland remains the only Australian state with no upper house in its parliament. Theodore was popular among the general public, and won two state elections (1920 and 1923) before resigning in 1925 to enter federal politics. He was defeated at his first attempt, but two years later won a by-election for the Sydney seat of Dalley.

In 1929, Theodore was elected deputy leader to James Scullin. He became Treasurer and &quot; de facto &quot; Deputy Prime Minister after the 1929 election, but resigned after less than a year amid accusations of corruption. Theodore returned as a Treasurer in early 1931, and served until the government&#x27;s landslide defeat at the 1931 election, where he lost his own seat. He had little success in combating the Great Depression, and disputes over economic policy led to a party split and several defections to Lang Labor and the United Australia Party. Theodore was only 47 when he left politics, and went on to have a successful business career as a partner of Frank Packer.

==Early life==
Theodore was born on 29 December 1884 in Port Adelaide, South Australia, the second of six children born to Annie (née Tanner) and Basil Stephen Theodore. His parents had met in 1882, on the passage from England to Australia. After arriving in Fremantle, Western Australia, they initially went their separate ways; they kept in touch by letter, however, and by the end of the year had married in Perth. They subsequently moved to Adelaide, where their first son Stephen was born the following year.

Theodore&#x27;s father, originally named Vasile Teodorescu, was born in Galați, Romania, into a well-to-do family connected with the Romanian nobility. He and his brother travelled to London in their youth, where they learned English. His parents had intended that he follow his father into the Romanian Orthodox priesthood, but he quit divinity school to join the British Merchant Navy. Theodore&#x27;s mother was born in Manchester, England, and descended from Irish immigrants. Her father died when she was an infant, and she was sent to work in the Lancashire cotton mills. When her mother died, she accepted an invitation to join her step-brother Tom Harrison (an ex-convict) at his farm in Greenough, Western Australia; however, she stayed there only a few months before returning to Perth to marry.

Theodore was educated at Lefevre Peninsula Catholic and Aldgate State schools in Adelaide, but left school at 12 to work on the Adelaide docks. In 1900, aged 16, he left for the goldfields of Western Australia, working as a labourer at Lennonville and Peak Hill. He then joined a guano mining crew on the Houtman Abrolhos, where he acquired his lifelong love of fishing. After a while, Theodore returned to the mainland and worked as a gold miner at Day Dawn and Kalgoorlie. He went back to Adelaide for Christmas 1902, and then joined his father on an unsuccessful prospecting expedition to Leigh Creek and Bundaleer, where they had hoped to find copper. Later in 1903, Theodore got his first experience in industrial relations, helping negotiate a wage increase for miners at Arltunga. He then decided to try his luck at Broken Hill, New South Wales. In 1906 he left for Cairns, Queensland where he prospected for tin in the Chillagoe area and worked in the Vulcan Mine in Irvinebank. It was among the unorganised workers of Stannary Hills and Irvinebank that the Amalgamated Workers&#x27; Association of North Queensland was born.

==State politics==
Theodore founded the Amalgamated Workers&#x27; Association with Bill McCormack. This union used the process and principle of amalgamation to unify with other unions until it became Australia&#x27;s largest union, the Australian Workers&#x27; Union (AWU). Theodore became Queensland state president of the AWU in 1913. Meanwhile, he had been elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland in Woothakata from 1909 to 1912 for the Australian Labor Party and subsequently from 1912 to 1925 in Chillagoe (the seat of Woothakata renamed). His position in the AWU made him a power in the Parliamentary Labor Party, and when Labor won a majority in the Assembly for the first time in 1915, he became Treasurer and Secretary for Public Works in the government of T. J. Ryan.

===Premier of Queensland===
In 1919, Ryan resigned and Theodore succeeded him as Premier of Queensland, then Australia&#x27;s only Labor state government, following the great split in the Labor Party over the issue of conscription in World War I. He was a popular and successful Premier, and soon began to be talked about as a possible federal Labor leader. Important educational measures were implemented, which benefited the handicapped and isolated, adult franchise in local government was introduced, and the upper house of Parliament abolished. Workers benefited from the introduction of a compulsory unemployment scheme, changes in the Safety and Accommodation Acts, and the Profiteering Prevention Act. Improvements in housing were also secured through amendments to the Savings Bank Act, the Workers&#x27; Homes Act, and the Fair Rents Act. Agriculture also received much attention through measures like the Agricultural Education Act, the Irrigation Act, the Main Roads Act, and the establishment of an Agricultural Bank, a cold store, a state cannery, a Cheese Pool, and a wheat board. Orderly marketing and controls on price fluctuations were also carried out to develop agriculture, while the Theodore Government also involved itself in the marketing of Queensland fruit produce.

In 1925, Theodore resigned as Premier and stood for the Queensland seat of Herbert in the federal election, but was unexpectedly defeated by Lewis Nott by 268 votes.

==Federal politics==
Theodore was elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Dalley in Sydney at a 1927 by-election. His status as an outsider in Sydney Labor politics was a permanent problem for him, but he soon made his mark in federal Parliament. In 1929 he became Deputy Leader of the Labor Party and Deputy Opposition Leader under James Scullin. In October 1929 Scullin defeated the conservative government of Stanley Bruce and became Prime Minister, while Theodore became Treasurer and &quot; de facto &quot; Deputy Prime Minister.

Two days after the Scullin government was sworn in, the US stock market crashed. The effects of the Great Depression were soon felt in Australia, and the Scullin government, like others, was hard pressed to deal with mounting unemployment and the collapse of world trade, on which Australia&#x27;s export-based economy depended. Theodore, an early advocate of Keynesian economics, favoured deficit spending to rejuvenate the economy. However, Works and Railways Minister Joseph Lyons and Trade Minister James Fenton supported a more traditional, deflationary approach.

Meanwhile, a conservative government had taken power in Queensland, and appointed a Royal Commission to investigate Theodore&#x27;s financial dealings as Premier. The Commission found that Theodore and another former Queensland Premier William McCormack, had corruptly profited by authorising the purchase by the state of a copper mine at Mungana while concealing the fact that they had a financial interest in the mine, which furthermore was not economically viable. In July 1930 the &quot;Mungana affair&quot; forced Theodore&#x27;s resignation.

Without Theodore&#x27;s leadership and financial skills, the Scullin government drifted into deeper crisis. When it became apparent that the Queensland government did not intend charging Theodore with any offence, Scullin re-appointed him as Treasurer, in January 1931. Lyons and Fenton felt that Scullin should have waited until Theodore had been formally cleared, and resigned from cabinet in protest. Two months later, they and three of their supporters crossed the floor to the non-Labor opposition, and eventually joined forces with the Nationalists to form the United Australia Party, led by Lyons.

===The Depression===
During 1931 Theodore faced the greatest economic crisis in Australian history. The government imported an advisor from the Bank of England, Dr Otto Niemeyer, who recommended an &quot;orthodox&quot; solution, including sharp reductions in government spending such as pensions and unemployment benefits. The radical Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, on the other hand, campaigned for the repudiation of Australia&#x27;s debt to bond-holders in London.

Theodore rejected both these alternatives and proposed instead an expansion of credit to farmers and small business, through the issue of &quot;fiduciary notes&quot; which could be redeemed after the Depression. His Fiduciary Notes Bill was denounced as financially unsound by orthodox economists and the banks. It was eventually defeated in the Senate, which was still controlled by the conservative opposition. Theodore has been described as a visionary proto-Keynesian for this proposal, although it cannot be known what effect his measures would have had on the Depression had the bill been passed.

In March 1931, Lang&#x27;s supporters in Parliament deserted the main body of Labor. Combined with the defection of Lyons and his supporters a few weeks earlier, this cost Scullin his majority. In November, the UAP and Langites rose to defeat the government on a non-confidence motion, and an election was held in December. Theodore had no base of support in Sydney and he lost his seat to Lang candidate Sol Rosevear. This ended Theodore&#x27;s political career, although during the 1930s several offers were made to him to return.

He was the only sitting treasurer to lose his seat until Josh Frydenberg in 2022.

==Later life==
===Newspaper industry===
Theodore left politics entirely after his defeat. In 1932, Theodore began a business relationship with 25-year-old Frank Packer, the son of newspaper industry veteran R. C. Packer. The duo formed Sydney Newspapers Limited with the aim of acquiring &quot;The World&quot;, a daily newspaper published by the Australian Workers&#x27; Union that was known to be in financial difficulties. For £100, they acquired the rights to lease the masthead and plant for one year. It was subsequently announced that the newspaper would be re-branded as &quot;The Star&quot; and would be priced at 1d (one penny), compared with 1½d for its major rival &quot;The Sun&quot;, published by Associated Newspapers Limited. Hugh Denison, the managing director of Associated Newspapers, paid Theodore and Packer £86,500 in return for an agreement for them not to publish a daily or Sunday newspaper for three years.

Theodore invested most of his profits back into Associated Newspapers, buying shares at a low price and selling them later for a 500–600% return. He and Frank Packer subsequently decided to create a new weekly magazine for women, which they titled &quot;The Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. George Warnecke, an ALP acquaintance of Theodore&#x27;s, was appointed as the founding editor. The new publication proved immensely successful, and in 1936 Theodore and Packer joined forces with Denison to form Australian Consolidated Press (ACP), which became the new publisher of the &quot;Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot; and Denison&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. Theodore served as chairman of the new company, but &quot;interested himself only in the financial and administrative aspects&quot; while Packer concentrated on publishing.

===Fiji===
In 1933, Theodore learned that gold had been found in Fiji on the island of Viti Levu. The area of interest had been pegged by Bill Borthwick and leased by Pat Costello, both of whom had connections with Queensland. Theodore contacted Costello, an old acquaintance, about the find, and offered to finance further exploration of the area. He formed a syndicate with Frank Packer, John Wren, and Wren&#x27;s associate Patrick Cody, with each of them holding a quarter stake. Geological findings were initially unfavourable. Eventually three mines were established – Emperor, Loloma and Dolphin – with Theodore as managing director of all three. Their success sparked a minor gold rush, but by the end of 1936 the three mines were the only ones remaining. By 1943 Loloma alone had yielded $10 million worth of gold and paid over $2 million in dividends.

Theodore took a keen interest in the welfare of the miners. He advised the government on the creation of medical benefits and workers&#x27; compensation schemes, while the company town had three schools, a golf course, a bowling green, tennis courts, a dispensary and a maternity hospital. Due to his success in Fiji, Theodore was approached by the British administrations in Borneo and the Solomon Islands to lead prospecting expeditions. Neither were successful, and he contracted malaria while in Borneo; upon his return, he was presented with a &quot;tabua&quot; (polished whale&#x27;s tooth) and elevated to the chiefly rank of &quot;ratu&quot;. Theodore took up full-time residence in Fiji, returning to Australia only for business trips and trout-fishing. He had a residence outside of Suva, and while at the mines lived in a &quot;bure&quot;.

===World War II===
In March 1939, Prime Minister Joseph Lyons cabled Theodore in Fiji, asking him to return to Australia and co-ordinate the country&#x27;s national resources for defence purposes. However, due to Lyons&#x27; defection from Labor being a key contributor to Theodore&#x27;s political demise, Theodore therefore declined, stating that &quot;in the absence of some emergency involving the national safety, I would like to keep out of politics&quot;. In the event however Lyons&#x27; offer became moot when he died the following month April before anything could be arranged.
In May 1940, the Loan Council offered him the position of coordinator of works. This proved highly controversial among members of the government, and Prime Minister Robert Menzies issued a statement explaining that the offer had been made entirely by the Loan Council and would have to be ratified by cabinet. Theodore eventually agreed in February 1942 to oversee the creation of the Allied Works Council, with himself as Director-General of Allied Works. He subsequently established the Civil Constructional Corps (CCC) to undertake construction work requested by the military.

Theodore faced criticism and political interference from his former opponents in the ALP, particularly Jack Lang and Eddie Ward, the Minister for Labour and National Service. He requested that the Department of Labour and National Service provide the CCC with lists of men available for work, but Ward refused to allow the information to be issued. The corps had to resort to telephone directories and electoral rolls in order to recruit sufficient workers. Ward then attacked Theodore for calling up elderly and deceased men. In September 1942, Theodore tendered his resignation to Curtin, citing Ward&#x27;s lack of cooperation. Curtin relaxed political controls and gave him additional powers, including the ability to prosecute men who refused to work. He rescinded his resignation and eventually left the position in October 1944.

===Final years===
Theodore was a delegate to the Imperial Press Conference in London in 1946. He resumed his work in Fiji and considered moving there permanently. However, the following year he was diagnosed with a serious heart condition. His health declined rapidly and he began handing business responsibilities to his children; he resigned from ACP in January 1949.

After several days in a coma, Theodore died at his flat in Edgecliff on 9 February 1950, at the age of 65. His funeral was held at St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney, with the mass celebrated by his friend James Duhig, Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane. He was buried at South Head Cemetery.

==Personal life==
Theodore married Esther Mahoney on 20 December 1909. She worked as a photographic tinter and was the daughter of a cabinetmaker from Toowoomba. The couple had two sons and two daughters. She was eleven years his senior. The couple were estranged at the time of Theodore&#x27;s death in 1950. After Ted&#x27;s death his son John assumed charge of the family&#x27;s joint business interests with Frank Packer and he became the first managing director of Channel 9.

==Assessment==
The Mungana affair likely cost Theodore a chance to become prime minister, and would &quot;irreparably taint his reputation during his lifetime and beyond&quot;. Historian Ross Fitzgerald has called him &quot;the most talented Labor politician never to be prime minister of Australia&quot;, and noted that his admirers include Paul Keating, Bob Katter, and Jack Lang (his former opponent).

== Named in his honour ==
The following things were named after Theodore:
* Theodore, a town in the Shire of Banana
* Electoral district of Theodore, an electorate in the Queensland Legislative Assembly created in the 2017 Queensland state electoral redistribution

<text>Olivier Martinez (born 12 January 1966)
is a French actor. He became well known after roles in several French films such as &quot;Un, deux, trois, soleil&quot; (1993), which garnered him the César Award for &quot;Most Promising Actor&quot;, &quot;The Horseman on the Roof&quot; (1995), and &quot;The Chambermaid on the Titanic&quot; (1997). He has also appeared in Hollywood-produced features, including the drama &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; (2000), the erotic thriller &quot;Unfaithful&quot; (2002) and playing the role of a French drug lord in the action-crime-thriller &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (2003).

==Early life==
Martinez was born in Paris, France, to a working-class family. His father was a Spanish professional boxer and his mother was a French secretary. He studied at the CNSAD and began his acting career in his native France in 1990. Martinez was raised Catholic.

==Career==
In 1994, Martinez won a César Award as &quot;Most Promising Actor&quot; for his role in the film &quot;Un, deux, trois, soleil&quot; (1993). This was followed by a leading role in the Jean-Paul Rappeneau period film &quot;The Horseman on the Roof&quot; (&quot;Le Hussard sur le Toit&quot;) in 1995 in which he starred alongside Juliette Binoche as an Italian nobleman. The film was hailed as the most expensive French film at that time in history but failed to reach its $35 million budget. In 1996/7 he appeared in Bertrand Blier&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;My Man&quot; (&quot;Mon Homme&quot;) alongside Anouk Grinberg, Gérard Lanvin, and Valeria Bruni Tedeschi. Later in 1997 he played a leading role in Bigas Luna&#x27;s drama &quot;The Chambermaid on the Titanic&quot; (&quot;La Femme de chambre du Titanic&quot;) alongside Romane Bohringer, set during the time of the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s sinking voyage in 1912. Martinez portrays a French foundry worker who wins a strongman contest and the prize of a trip to view the departing maiden voyage of the ill-fated Titanic. The film was well-received; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised what he felt was a rare honest portrayal of male sexuality by Martinez.

Martinez first came to mainstream attention in Hollywood films with his performance in Julian Schnabel&#x27;s &quot;Before Night Falls&quot; (2000) opposite Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp. The screenplay is based on the autobiography of the same name of Reinaldo Arenas, which was published in English in 1993. The film was highly critically acclaimed, although Martinez&#x27;s performance was overshadowed by that of Bardem in the eyes of critics. He was later noted for his performance opposite Diane Lane in &quot;Unfaithful&quot; (2002). He has since appeared in a television adaptation of &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; (2003), &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (2003) and &quot;Taking Lives&quot; (2004). He also starred as Gabriel in the 2007 movie adaptation of &quot;Blood and Chocolate&quot;, a popular book. Martinez plays Mauritius, prefect of Mamertine Prison in &quot;Paul, Apostle of Christ&quot; (2017).

==Personal life==
Martinez began a relationship with Australian singer and actress Kylie Minogue after meeting her at the 2003 Grammy Awards ceremony. They ended their relationship in February 2007.

Martinez began dating American actress Halle Berry in 2010 after meeting on the set of the action thriller film &quot;Dark Tide&quot; (2012). They confirmed their engagement in March 2012. On 22 November 2012, Martinez was treated at a Los Angeles hospital after being injured in a physical altercation with Canadian model Gabriel Aubry, Berry&#x27;s former partner and father of her daughter. Aubry and Berry had been involved in a custody battle centered on Berry&#x27;s desire to move with their daughter and Martinez to his native France, a request denied by a judge less than two weeks prior to the altercation, on the grounds that it would interfere with Berry and Aubry&#x27;s joint custody arrangement. The custody dispute was resolved at the end of November.

Berry and Martinez married in a private ceremony in France on 13 July 2013. Their son was born in October 2013 in Los Angeles. They announced their divorce in 2015, and it was finalized in December 2016. In August 2023, issues dealing with custody and child support were settled.

Apart from his native French, he is also fluent in Spanish, and English.

<doc id="617425" wikidata="Q4706096" url="?curid=617425" title="Alan Autry">
<text>Carlos Alan Autry Jr. (also known for a time as Carlos Brown; born July 31, 1952) is an American actor, politician, and former football player. During his brief career in the National Football League, he played as a quarterback and was known as Carlos Brown.

Autry played the role of Captain Bubba Skinner on the NBC, and later CBS, television drama series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, starring Carroll O&#x27;Connor. He has also appeared in films and other television shows. In November 2000, he was elected mayor of Fresno, California, and served for two four-year terms through January 2009. From 2008 to 2011, Autry hosted a talk-radio show on KYNO AM 940 in Fresno. He now hosts a midday show on KXEX 1550 AM in Fresno.

==Early life==

Autry was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, the son of Carl and Verna (née Brown) Autry. His name was changed to Carlos Brown when he was a year old, after his parents divorced. He worked alongside his mother and stepfather, Joe Duty, in California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley, where they planted and harvested cotton, grapes, and other crops, traveling around the valley living in migrant-worker camps. When he was 12, they settled in Riverdale, California.

==Football career==
In high school, Autry was a star quarterback for the Riverdale Cowboys. He received an athletic scholarship to the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California, where he was a second-string tight end in his senior year for the Tigers. In 1975, he was selected by the Green Bay Packers, where he ended up in 1976, as the starting quarterback for three games.

His football career ended quickly when he was cut from the team by then-coach Bart Starr. Autry then went to Hollywood to become an actor. He made a football comeback attempt, playing for the B.C. Lions of the CFL in 1979 (as Carlos Brown). He was the third-string quarterback behind Joe Paopao and another ex-Green Bay Packer, Jerry Tagge.

==Acting career==

Autry made his film debut in the 1978 motion picture &quot;Remember My Name&quot;. He met his father, Carl Autry Sr., for the first time in 1981, while on location in Shreveport for the motion picture &quot;Southern Comfort&quot;, after he found Carl&#x27;s name in the telephone book. Afterwards, he made the decision to return to his birth surname of Autry. During his acting years, he struggled with drug and alcohol use, according to an interview with Pat Robertson&#x27;s &quot;The 700 Club&quot; in 2007.

==Other==
After nine years in Hollywood, Autry returned home and left his career. &quot;I realized that God had moved in my life like never before. I really realized what God and the power of Jesus Christ was,&quot; he said on &quot;The 700 Club.&quot; 
By 1986, he was divorced and became a born-again Christian and began to devote much of his time to working with charitable causes. He is married to his second wife, Kimberlee Autry; the couple has three children.

==Politics==

Autry, a Republican, was elected in 2000 to succeed Jim Patterson as the mayor of Fresno, defeating former mayor Dan Whitehurst. He was elected to a second term (2005–2009) on March 2, 2004, with more than 72% of the vote. Because of term limits, he was ineligible to run for re-election. In November 2008, he endorsed Ashley Swearengin, who was elected to succeed him as mayor.

==Dirt Road Productions==
In 1997, Autry launched his own production company, Dirt Road Productions. In 2002, he released &quot;The Legend of Jake Kincaid&quot;, a Western-based on a story he wrote. He was also the director of this film.

==Music==

Autry and his &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; co-star Randall Franks joined forces under the banner of Autry-Franks Productions to produce the charity &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; CD &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&quot;&#x27;, featuring the cast of the show. The project raised funds for drug-abuse prevention charities. With Franks producing, Autry performed his rendition of &quot;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer&quot; in homage to Gene Autry. (Gene and Alan were distant cousins, descended from William A. Autry (5 August 1784 – 2 April 1836) and Mary Campbell of North Carolina/Tennessee.)

Franks and Autry both performed on &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&#x27;&quot;. The duo was able to include many music legends, including Kitty Wells, Jimmy Dickens, and Pee Wee King, and many from the bluegrass genre, from Jim &amp; Jesse to The Lewis Family. The &quot;Christmas Time&#x27;s A Comin&quot;&#x27; CD, released on Sonlite and MGM/UA, was one of the most popular Christmas releases of 1991 and 1992 with Southern retailers.

Crimson Records released their second Autry-Franks Productions project &quot;Alan Autry and Randall Franks Mississippi Moon: Country Traditions&quot; in 2013, an Americana CD featuring both actors vocally on various classic and original songs. The project, which incorporates country, bluegrass, and Southern gospel, includes special appearances by Bluegrass Hall of Fame members Jim and Jesse McReynolds and three-time Dove Award nominee Mark Wheeler of the Marksmen Quartet.

<doc id="617451" wikidata="Q1327574" url="?curid=617451" title="Majoritarianism">
<text>Majoritarianism is a political philosophy or ideology with an agenda asserting that a majority, whether based on a religion, language, social class, or other category of the population, is entitled to a certain degree of primacy in society, and has the right to make decisions that affect the society. This traditional view has come under growing criticism, and liberal democracies have increasingly included constraints on what the parliamentary majority can do, in order to protect citizens&#x27; fundamental rights. Majoritarianism should not be confused with electoral systems that give seats to candidates with only a plurality of votes. Although such systems are sometimes called majoritarian systems, they use plurality, not majority, to set winners. Some electoral systems, such as instant-runoff voting, are most often majoritarianwinners are most often determined by having majority of the votes that are being countedbut not always. A parliament that gives lawmaking power to any group that holds a majority of seats may be called a majoritarian parliament. Such is the case in the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of Saudi Arabia and many other chambers of power.

Under a democratic majoritarian political structure, the majority would not exclude any minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism is sometimes pejoratively referred to by its opponents as &quot;ochlocracy&quot; or &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot;. Majoritarianism is often referred to as &quot;majority rule&quot;, which may refer to a majority class &quot;ruling&quot; over a minority class, while not referring to the decision process called &quot;majority rule&quot;. Majority rule is a belief that the majority community should be able to rule a country in whichever way it wants. However, due to active dis-empowerment of the minority or minorities, in many cases what is claimed as the majority with the right to rule is only a minority of the voters.

Advocates of majoritarianism argue that majority decision making is intrinsically democratic and that any restriction on majority decision making is intrinsically undemocratic. If democracy is restricted by a constitution that cannot be changed by a simple majority decision, then yesterday&#x27;s majority is being given more weight than today&#x27;s. If it is restricted by some small group, such as aristocrats, judges, priests, soldiers, or philosophers, then society becomes an oligarchy. The only restriction acceptable in a majoritarian system is that a current majority has no right to prevent a different majority emerging in the future; this could happen, for example, if a minority persuades enough of the majority to change its position. In particular, a majority cannot exclude a minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism does not prohibit a decision being made by representatives as long as this decision is made via majority rule, as it can be altered at any time by any different majority emerging in the future.

One critique of majoritarianism is that systems without supermajority requirements for changing the rules for voting can be shown to likely be unstable. Among other critiques of majoritarianism is that most decisions in fact take place not by majority rule, but by plurality, unless the voting system purposefully channels votes for candidates or options in such a way as to guarantee a majority, such as is done under Contingent voting, two-round voting and Instant-runoff voting. According to Gibbard’s theorem and Arrow&#x27;s paradox, it is not possible to have a voting system with more than two options that retains adherence to both certain &quot;fairness&quot; criteria and rational decision-making criteria. 

Unchecked majoritarianism may threaten the rights of minority groups. Some democracies have tried to resolve this by requiring supermajority support to enact changes to basic rights. For example, in the United States, the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of religion are written into the Constitution, meaning it would take more than a simple majority of the members of Congress to repeal the rights. This actually empowers a minority and makes it stronger than the majority. Other democracies have sought to address threats to minority rights by adopting proportional voting systems that guarantee at least some seats in their national legislatures to minority political factions. Examples include New Zealand, where mixed-member proportional voting is used, and Australia, where a single transferable vote system is used. Whether these methods have succeeded in protecting minority interests, or have gone too far, remains a matter for debate. 

==Types==
Majoritarianism, as a concept of government, branches out into several forms. The classic form includes unicameralism and a unitary state. Qualified majoritarianism is a more inclusionary form, with degrees of decentralization and federalism. Integrative majoritarianism incorporates several institutions to preserve minority groups and foster moderate political parties.

==History and legacy==
There are relatively few instances of large-scale majority rule in recorded history, most notably the majoritarian system of Athenian democracy and other ancient Greek city-states. However, some argue that none of those Greek city-states were truly majority rule, particularly due to their exclusion of women, non-landowners, and slaves from decision-making processes. Most of the famous ancient philosophers staunchly opposed majoritarianism, because decisions based on the will of the uneducated and uninformed &#x27;masses&#x27; are not necessarily wise or just. Plato is a prime example with his &quot;Republic&quot;, which describes a societal model based on a tripartite class structure. Anarchist anthropologist David Graeber offers a reason as to why majority democratic government is so scarce in the historical record. &quot;Majority democracy, we might say, can only emerge when two factors coincide: 1. a feeling that people should have equal say in making group decisions, and 2. a coercive apparatus capable of enforcing those decisions.&quot; Graeber argues that those two factors almost never meet: &quot;Where egalitarian societies exist, it is also usually considered wrong to impose systematic coercion. Where a machinery of coercion did exist, it did not even occur to those wielding it that they were enforcing any sort of popular will.&quot;

Majoritarianism (as a theory), similar to democracy, has often been used as a pretext by sizable or aggressive minorities to politically oppress other smaller (or civically inactive) minorities, or even sometimes a civically inactive majority (see Richard Nixon&#x27;s reference to the &quot;Silent Majority&quot; that he asserted supported his policies). This agenda is most frequently encountered in the realm of religion: In essentially all Western nations, for instance, Christmas Day—and in some countries, other important dates in the Christian year as well—are recognized as legal holidays; plus a particular denomination may be designated as the state religion and receive financial backing from the government (examples include the Church of England in England and the Lutheran Church in the Scandinavian countries). Virtually all countries also have one or more official languages, often to the exclusion of some minority group or groups within that country who do not speak the language or languages so designated. In most cases, those decisions have not been made using a majoritarian referendum, and even in the rare case when a referendum has been used, a new majority is not allowed to emerge at any time and repeal it.

==Reform and backlash==
In recent times—especially beginning in the 1960s—some forms of majoritarianism have been countered by liberal reformers in many countries. In the 1963 case &quot;Abington School District v. Schempp&quot;, the United States Supreme Court declared that school-led prayer in the nation&#x27;s public schools was unconstitutional, and since then many localities have sought to limit, or even prohibit, religious displays on public property. The movement toward greater consideration for the rights of minorities within a society is often referred to as pluralism. This has provoked a backlash from some advocates of majoritarianism, who lament the Balkanization of society they claim has resulted from the gains made by the multiculturalism; these concerns were articulated in a 1972 book, &quot;The Dispossessed Majority&quot;, written by Wilmot Robertson. In turn, supporters of multiculturalism have accused majoritarians of racism and xenophobia.

<text>Egosoft GmbH (formerly Ego Software) is a German video game developer based in Würselen, Germany. The company was founded by Bernd Lehahn in 1988.

Egosoft is best known for its &quot;X&quot; series of video games, a series of space simulator games noted for combining open-ended gameplay, dynamic market-driven economy and compelling storyline. The series began in 1999 with &quot;&quot;. Since then, the series has expanded with three sequels and three standalone expansions; the latest being &quot;X4: Foundations&quot;, released 30 November 2018.

== History ==
Egosoft was founded in Würselen by Bernd Lehahn in 1988, making it the oldest active video game company in Germany. Its first game, &quot;Hotel Detective&quot;, was released for the Amiga in June 1988.

In 2000, Egosoft planned a multiplayer online game called &quot;Online Universe&quot; or &quot;X Online&quot;. This project was intended to be &quot;the next step in the evolution of Egosoft&#x27;s X universe.&quot; Egosoft has since released a number of games, yet has given little indication of the progress of this project. In 2003, Egosoft staff were working on a later version—codenamed &quot;X2OL&quot;—which Egosoft chief executive officer Bernd Lehahn described as their &quot;long-term goal.&quot; There is still no official information on the &quot;Online Universe&quot;, though there has been speculation that X2 and X3&#x27;s 2007 uplink feature may be a positive spin-off of the project.

In late 2009, Egosoft announced that &quot;Terran Conflict&quot; completed the story started in &quot;X: Beyond the Frontier&quot;, taken by some to mean the end of the franchise. However, in March 2011 they announced on their X-Universe forums that they would be attending FedCon XX in Düsseldorf on 28 April 2011, and would show preview footage of their current project, previously only referred to by the codename TNBT (&quot;The Next Big Thing&quot;). However, on 20 April 2011, they released a trailer officially announcing &quot;X Rebirth&quot;, initially slated for a Q4 2011 release. &quot;X Rebirth&quot; will take place in the X Universe after a major catastrophe (the shutdown of the series&#x27; network of jump gates, thus starting a new chapter in the X Universe separate from the original plot line. &quot;Rebirth&quot; missed its first two proposed release dates (Q4 2011 and 2012) and was eventually released 15 November 2013.

<text>Mori Chack (森チャック &quot;Mori Chakku&quot;, born on March 23, 1973 in Sakai, Osaka, Japan) is the artist name of a Japanese graphic designer.

== Biography ==
Chack is famous for his Chax product line, and especially the character Gloomy Bear he created in 2000.

Mori Chack also created Podolly (a sheep in a wolf&#x27;s clothing), and Kumakikai (a silver robot made from a recycled teddy bear). He also drew politically-oriented designs, such as the Statue of Liberty holding a molotov cocktail with the question &quot;Free?&quot;.

== Gloomy Bear ==

Chack is famous for his Chax product line, and especially the character Gloomy Bear, a 2 m tall, violent, pink bear that eats humans. Chack created the character in 2000. The design was created as an antithesis to the excessively cute products produced by companies such as Disney and Sanrio. The Gloomy Bear is an allegory for Chack&#x27;s belief that humans and animals are incompatible. The animal is often shown stained with blood and attacking humans.

The origin story of Gloomy Bear is that he was abandoned as a little bear and adopted by Pity (a little boy). The cute bear eventually grew up into an angry adult bear and attacked Pity, explaining its blood stains. However, Pity knew Gloomy was innocent in his violence, and always ended up hugging the bear back despite the savage beating.

A segment on &quot;Gloomy Bear&quot; and a short interview with Mori Chack are featured in Episode 6 of Series 2 of the BBC Three series &quot;Japanorama&quot;. The topic of the episode was &quot;Kawaii&quot;, which is Japanese for &quot;cute&quot;.

The character Gloomy Bear received a TV anime titled &quot;Gloomy the Naughty Grizzly&quot; in April 2021. A one-shot manga titled &quot;Gloomy Bear: Apocalyptic Love&quot; was released on April 4, 2023.

<text>Vincenzo Cerulli (20 April 1859 – 30 May 1927) was an Italian astronomer and founder of the Collurania-Teramo Observatory in Teramo, central Italy, where he was born.

He earned a degree in physics from the Sapienza University of Rome in 1881, and continued his studies at the University of Berlin. Cerulli compiled a star catalog with Elia Millosevich. He was the astronomer at the Pontifical Gregorian University.

In 1890, he founded his observatory, which he named &quot;Collurania&quot;, equipping it with a 40 cm Cooke refractor, which he had purchased for £2000 (£210,652 at the 2020 equivalent) from the son of British Astronomer, James Wigglesworth (born, Wibsey 1815) and which had been situated in Scarborough, before being dismantled and moved to Teramo. He also observed Mars and developed the theory that the Martian canals were not real but an optical illusion, a theory that was later confirmed.

He discovered one asteroid, 704 Interamnia, which is named after the Latin name for Teramo, and is notable for its relatively large diameter of approximately 350 km, which makes it the fifth largest body in the traditional asteroid belt.

Cerulli was a corresponding member of the Lincei Academy, Rome; the Pontaniana Academy, Naples; and the Academy of Sciences, Turin. He contributed the article on Lorenzo Respighi to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;.

Cerulli died at Merate, Province of Lecco, in 1927. The 130-kilometer Martian crater &quot;Cerulli&quot;, as well as the asteroids 366 Vincentina and 31028 Cerulli are named in his honor.

<doc id="617484" wikidata="Q934616" url="?curid=617484" title="Joi Ito">
<text>is a Japanese entrepreneur and venture capitalist. He is the president of Chiba Institute of Technology. He is a former director of the MIT Media Lab, former professor of the practice of media arts and sciences at MIT, and a former visiting professor of practice at Harvard Law School. 

Ito has received recognition for his role as an entrepreneur focused on Internet and technology companies and has founded, among other companies, PSINet Japan, Digital Garage, and Infoseek Japan. Ito is a general partner of Neoteny Labs, and former board member of Creative Commons (where he was CEO), The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, The New York Times Company, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, The Mozilla Foundation, The Open Source Initiative, and Sony Corporation. Ito wrote a monthly column in the Ideas section of Wired.

Following the exposure of his personal and professional financial ties to sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein, Ito resigned from his roles at MIT, Harvard, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Knight Foundation, PureTech Health, and The New York Times Company on September 7, 2019.

==Early life and education==

Ito was born in Kyoto, Japan. His family moved to Canada and then to the United States, when Ito was about three, to a suburb of Detroit, Michigan, where his father became a research scientist and his mother a secretary for Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., now Ovonics. The founder of his mother&#x27;s company, Stanford R. Ovshinsky, was impressed with young Ito, whom he thought of almost as his son. Ovshinsky mentored the boy&#x27;s interests in technology and social movements, and when Ito was 13, gave him work with scientists, saying, &quot;He was not a child in the conventional sense.&quot;

Ito and his sister Mizuko Ito, called Mimi, spent summers in Japan with their grandmother, who taught them about traditional Japanese culture. At age 14, he returned to Japan, when his mother was promoted to president of Energy Conversion Devices Japan. He studied at the Nishimachi International School and, for high school, the American School in Japan in Tokyo. In that phase of his life, Ito also learned &quot;street language, street smarts, and computers&quot;. One of the few Japanese using modems before networking deregulation reached Japan, in 1985, Ito had found The Source and the original MUD by his teens (and by 26, was working on his own MUD).

Ito returned to the United States to attend Tufts University as a computer science major, where he met, among others, Pierre Omidyar, later founder of eBay. As he deemed his course work too rigid and believed that learning computer science in school was &quot;stupid&quot;, Ito dropped out of Tufts to work briefly for Ovonics. Ovshinsky encouraged him to return to school. Ito enrolled at the University of Chicago in physics but later dropped out as the program was overly oriented towards producing practical engineers rather than teaching an intuitive understanding of physics. In the fall of 1985, Ito became the first student to register for a pioneering program of online courses, offered by Connected Education, Inc., for undergraduate credit from The New School for Social Research. Ito also attended Hitotsubashi University, according to his essay in Japanese.

Ito received a doctorate by thesis &quot;The Practice of Change&quot; from the Graduate School of Media and Governance of Keio University in 2018.

Ito is one of Timothy Leary&#x27;s godsons—a close, nontraditional familial relationship that Leary reportedly developed for a few of his friends&#x27; children. Ito&#x27;s sister, Mizuko Ito, is a cultural anthropologist, studying media technology use, and the musician Cornelius is his second cousin. Ito currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife Mizuka Ito (née Kurogane).

==Career==
Ito became a disc jockey working in nightclubs in Chicago such as the Limelight and Smart Bar, also working with Metasystems Design Group to start a virtual community in Tokyo. Later, Ito ran a nightclub in Roppongi, Japan, called XY Relax, with help from Joe Shanahan of Metro Chicago/Smart Bar. He helped bring industrial music from Chicago (Wax Trax) and later the rave scene, managing a DJ team and visual artists, including importing Anarchic Adjustment to Japan.
Ito was the Chairman of Creative Commons from December 2006 until 2012. He is on the board of Digital Garage, Culture Convenience Club (CCC), Tucows, and EPIC, and is on the advisory boards of Creative Commons and WITNESS. He is the founder and CEO of the venture capital firm Neoteny Co., Ltd. In October 2004, he was named to the board of ICANN for a three-year term starting December 2004. In August 2005, he joined the board of the Mozilla Foundation, until April 2016. He was on the board of the Open Source Initiative (OSI) from March 2005 until April 2007. He was a founding board member of Expression College for Digital Arts as well as the Zero One Art and Technology Network. In 1999, he was the Associate to Mr. Mount (the executive producer) on the film &quot;The Indian Runner&quot;. Ito also was a board member of Energy Conversion Devices from 1995 to 2000.

Ito is a venture capitalist and angel investor and was an early stage investor in Kickstarter, Twitter, Six Apart, Technorati, Flickr, Wikia, SocialText, Dopplr, Last.fm, Rupture, Kongregate, Fotopedia, Diffbot, Formlabs, 3Dsolve and other Internet companies. A vocal advocate of emergent democracy and the sharing economy, Ito is a doctoral candidate in Business Administration focusing on the sharing economy at the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy, Hitotsubashi University. He is the author of &quot;Emergent Democracy&quot;. Ito is Senior Visiting Researcher of Keio Research Institute at SFC. In May 2011, it was announced that Ito&#x27;s company, Digital Garage, would provide PR, marketing, product marketing research and market research for LinkedIn Japan.

Ito is a PADI IDC Staff Instructor, an Emergency First Responder Instructor Trainer, and a Divers Alert Network (DAN) Instructor Trainer.

In a 2011 interview, he stated that Japan needed to look internationally if it was to continue to be &quot;relevant&quot;.

On May 11, 2017 Ito was awarded the IRI Medal.

===MIT Media Lab (2011–2019)===
In April 2011, Ito was named the director of the MIT Media Lab; he began in this role on September 1, 2011. His appointment was called an &quot;unusual choice&quot; since Ito studied at two colleges, but did not finish his degrees. &quot;The choice is radical, but brilliant&quot;, said Larry Smarr, director of Calit2. Nicholas Negroponte, Media Lab&#x27;s co-founder and chairman emeritus, described the choice as bringing the media to &quot;Joi&#x27;s world&quot;. In an interview with Asian Scientist Magazine, Ito discussed his vision for the MIT Media Lab, and how he liked the word &quot;learning&quot; better than the word &quot;education&quot;. He was appointed professor of the practice of media arts and sciences at MIT in 2016.

As of 2023, Ito is a member of the &quot;Council on Extended Intelligence&quot;, an initiative focused the ethics and governance of Artificial Intelligence, launched in 2018 by the MIT Media Lab and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

In August 2021, Ito was appointed as the Digital Auditor, the top administrative official of Japan&#x27;s Digital Agency. However, many people raised concerns about his appointment, because of his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. In September, after the Digital Agency was established, Ito was appointed as one of the members of the Digital Society Initiative Council, a panel of experts.

=== Departure from MIT (2019) ===
In 2019, revelations of Ito&#x27;s connections with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender, shed light on the extent of Epstein&#x27;s monetary gifts to the Media Lab and to Ito&#x27;s startups outside of MIT. Ito initially wrote an apology but refused to resign, which led to the departure of several prominent Media Lab members, including Ethan Zuckerman, director of the MIT&#x27;s Center for Civic Media, and Media Lab visiting scholar J. Nathan Matias. Calls for Ito to resign were followed by a website (wesupportjoi.org) and letter in support of Ito which appeared in late August signed by more than 100 people including Lawrence Lessig, Hiroshi Ishii, Stewart Brand, Nicholas Negroponte, Jonathan Zittrain, and George M. Church. However, the website was taken down after further details emerged. Ito later admitted to taking $525,000 in funding from Epstein for the lab, and permitting Epstein to invest 1.2 million in Ito&#x27;s personal investment funds.

==== Further revelations and leaked emails ====
On September 6, 2019, an article by Ronan Farrow in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; alleged that the lab led by Ito had &quot;a deeper fund-raising relationship with Epstein&quot; than it had acknowledged, and that the lab attempted to conceal the extent of its contacts with him. The article, based on leaked emails between Epstein, Ito and others, alleged that &quot;Ito and other lab employees took numerous steps to keep Epstein&#x27;s name from being associated with the donations he made or solicited&quot;, and that Ito specifically solicited individual donations from Epstein. The article further claimed that Epstein &quot;appeared to serve as an intermediary between the lab and other wealthy donors, soliciting millions of dollars in donations from individuals and organizations&quot; and that &quot;Epstein was credited with securing at least $7.5 million in donations for the lab&quot;. Ito, in an email to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; said &quot;The New Yorker&quot; report was &quot;full of factual errors&quot;. According to Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig the anonymity of the Jeffrey Epstein donations was to avoid &quot;whitewashing&quot; Epstein&#x27;s reputation and not to conceal the relationship between Ito and Epstein.

The president of MIT requested an &quot;immediate, thorough and independent&quot; investigation into the &quot;extremely serious&quot; and &quot;deeply disturbing allegations about the engagement between individuals at the Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein&quot;.

====Resignations====
In September 2019, Ito resigned as director of the Media Lab and as an MIT professor shortly after &quot;The New Yorker&quot; article. He also resigned from his visiting professorship at Harvard University. in addition he relinquished a number of other roles on September 7 amid the controversy:

* Ito left the board of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The MacArthur Foundation wrote, &quot;the recent reports of Ito&#x27;s behavior in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, if true, would not be in keeping with the values of MacArthur. Most importantly, our hearts go out to the girls and women who survived the abuse of Jeffrey Epstein.&quot;
* He resigned from the board of The New York Times Company following the Epstein revelations. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;Our newsroom will continue its aggressive reporting on Mr. Epstein, investigating both the individuals and the broader systems of power that enabled him for so many years.&quot;
* Ito resigned from the board of trustees of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, who wrote, &quot;Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s crimes continue to reverberate, most painfully with the girls and women who were his victims. We extend our deepest sympathies to them.&quot;
* He resigned as the chairman of PureTech Health. The company said that &quot;given circumstances related to the MIT Media Lab, we agreed that Joi&#x27;s resignation from PureTech was appropriate&quot;.

====Results of MIT investigation====
On January 10, 2020, MIT released results of its fact-finding on engagements with Jeffrey Epstein.
The investigation was conducted by Goodwin Procter LLP whose partners were retained to &quot;conduct investigation into both Epstein&#x27;s donations and Epstein&#x27;s other interactions with MIT&quot;.
The MIT Report found that &quot;donations to MIT were driven either by former Media Lab Director Joi Ito or by Seth Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering and physics, not by MIT&#x27;s central administration&quot;. However, the report also states that certain members of MIT&#x27;s Senior Team &quot;were aware of, and approved, Epstein&#x27;s donations to support Ito and the Media Lab&quot;. Furthermore, the report found that &quot;contrary to certain media reports, neither Epstein nor his foundations was ever coded as &#x27;disqualified&#x27; in MIT&#x27;s donor systems. Further, the code &#x27;disqualified&#x27; does not mean that a person or entity is &#x27;blacklisted&#x27; or prohibited from donating to the institute. Rather, the term &#x27;disqualified&#x27; is a database code for any donor who previously donated to MIT but presently is dormant or is no longer interested in giving to MIT.&quot;
The report&#x27;s executive summary ends with the finding that &quot;since MIT had no policy or processes for handling controversial donors in place at the time, the decision to accept Epstein&#x27;s post-conviction donations cannot be judged to be a policy violation. But it is clear that the decision was the result of collective and significant errors in judgment that resulted in serious damage to the MIT community.&quot;

===Center for Radical Transformation at CIT (2021–)===
In December 2021, Ito was appointed as the director of the Center for Radical Transformation (CRT) at Chiba Institute of Technology, Japan. He also is a member of CIT&#x27;s Board of Trustees.

===Chiba Institute of Technology===

In June 2023, Ito was named the 14th President of the Chiba Institute of Technology. His first public appearance as President is at the Japan-U.S. Research Collaboration Week. In September 2023, he outlined his vision for the future of Chiba Institute of Technology in the President&#x27;s Message.

<text>The Hungaroring is a motorsport racetrack in Mogyoród, Pest County, Hungary where the Formula One Hungarian Grand Prix is held. In 1986, it became the location of the first Formula One Grand Prix behind the Iron Curtain. Bernie Ecclestone wanted a race in the USSR, but a Hungarian friend recommended Budapest. They wanted a street circuit similar to the Circuit de Monaco to be built in the Népliget – Budapest&#x27;s largest park – but the government decided to build a new circuit just outside the city near a major highway. Construction works started on 1 October 1985. It was built in eight months, less time than any other Formula One circuit. The first race was held on 24 March 1986, in memory of János Drapál, the first Hungarian who won motorcycle Grand Prix races. According to a survey put together by the national tourism office of Hungary, Mogyoród ranks third among Hungarian destinations visited by tourists, behind the Danube Bend area and Lake Balaton, but ahead of Budapest. The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license.

==Description==

The Grand Prix is held in the middle of summer, which is usually extremely hot and dry in this region. Its first wet Grand Prix race was in 2006. The circuit is normally dusty due to underuse throughout the rest of the year and its sandy soil. As the circuit is in a valley about 80 percent of it can be seen from any point.

Normally, an underused circuit becomes faster over the weekend as the track surface gathers more rubber residue; however, with the Hungaroring this generally does not happen, because the track can get dusty so quickly. The track frequently becomes faster during a qualifying session, which leads competitors to try for their best lap as late as possible.

The twisty and bumpy nature of the circuit makes overtaking very difficult in dry conditions, the circuit is nicknamed &quot;Monaco without the barriers&quot; for this reason. Nonetheless, the Hungaroring has been the scene of several memorable races such as the duels of Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell&#x27;s win from 12th on the grid after a dramatic pass on Ayrton Senna in 1989, Damon Hill&#x27;s almost victory with Arrows in 1997, and Michael Schumacher&#x27;s change in strategy to beat the McLarens of Häkkinen and Coulthard in 1998. More recently, it has seen events such as Jenson Button triumphing over Fernando Alonso in the wet in 2006, Daniel Ricciardo scything through the field from sixth on the grid in 2014, Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s late overtake on Max Verstappen to take the win in 2019, and Alonso producing a defensive masterclass to deny Hamilton a chance of victory in 2021. Maiden wins at the track include Hill in 1993, Alonso in 2003, Button in 2006, Heikki Kovalainen in 2008, Esteban Ocon in 2021, and Oscar Piastri in 2024.

The first change in the track&#x27;s layout was carried out in 1989, when the chicane after the actual turn three (a temporary measure put in during construction due to the discovery of a spring where the direct route was due to run) was removed by culverting the stream. In 2003, the main straight (turn one, see diagram) was lengthened by roughly to , and the hairpin at the end of the straight was also tightened in an attempt to facilitate more overtaking opportunities, as well as a tightening of what was turn 12. These changes lengthened the circuit length from .

==Drivers==

Hungaroring has crowned two drivers in its 37-year history: both Nigel Mansell in 1992 and Michael Schumacher in 2001 were able to win the World Championship title. Moreover, the WilliamsF1 Team and Scuderia Ferrari also secured the Constructors&#x27; Championship at the Hungaroring, Williams in 1996 and Ferrari in 2001, 2002, and 2004.

Both Hungary&#x27;s Zsolt Baumgartner and Poland&#x27;s Robert Kubica made their debut on this track as the first F1 drivers of their countries.

The 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix was the first wet grand prix at the Hungaroring. This saw the retirement of many drivers including championship rivals Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher and gave Jenson Button and the reborn Honda F1 team their first win. Fernando Alonso also earned his first Grand Prix victory at this in 2003, declaring it his favourite track as a result.

According to statements and interviews, drivers have different opinions on the track. While many, like Ayrton Senna, Nigel Mansell, Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton, Max Verstappen and Fernando Alonso claimed to love it, many others consider the track too slow, hot and demanding.
The technical driving center of the Hungaroring held former racer Gerhard Berger&#x27;s name from 1998 until 2005 but later it was changed to Allianz.

The track also has named curves: Turn 4 is named after Nigel Mansell, due to him losing a wheel there during the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix. Turn 11 is named after Jean Alesi following his massive crash there during qualifying for the 1995 Hungarian Grand Prix.

On Saturday, 25 July 2009, in the second round of qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix at Hungaroring, Ferrari driver Felipe Massa&#x27;s head was injured, though protected by his driver&#x27;s helmet, he was struck by a suspension spring that had fallen from Rubens Barrichello&#x27;s Brawn GP car while driving at high speed. He was knocked unconscious, and subsequently crashed head-on into a tyre barrier. Massa was thereafter airlifted to the military hospital in Budapest, where he underwent surgery in the area surrounding his left eye. His condition was initially described as &quot;life-threatening but stable&quot;, but improved rapidly. Massa was discharged from hospital the following week and returned to Brazil. After further tests it was decided that Massa needed a titanium plate inserted into his skull to strengthen it for racing in Formula One again.

==Fans==

While most of the foreign fans are from Germany and Austria, the Hungaroring has traditionally seen a large influx of Finnish fans as well. With the loss of the Austrian Grand Prix in 2003, this became the closest Formula One event for fans from other Central European countries. However, the Austrian Grand Prix returned again in 2014. The 2006–2010 races saw many spectators from Poland due to the participation of Robert Kubica. Michael Schumacher&#x27;s success in the 1990s brought tens of thousands of German fans to Hungaroring each year. The trend began in 1992 and continued throughout the 2000s until his retirement in 2006. Schumacher won at Hungaroring in 1994, 1998, 2001 and 2004, finishing second in 2000 and 2002.

The contract is prolonged until 2032, although profits from tobacco advertising have been cut from the equation since such advertising was banned in 2007.

The Hungaroring is the home of Hungarian motorsport. Besides Formula One, it has also hosted the DTM and FIA GT Championship races. Since 2011, it also hosts the races of WTCC and WTCR as FIA WTCC Race of Hungary, a public drag race event takes place every month.

<doc id="617500" wikidata="Q6313183" url="?curid=617500" title="Junior Canadian Rangers">
<text>Junior Canadian Rangers are part of the Canadian Cadet Organizations and are linked to the Canadian Rangers. The program aims to offer young Canadians, aged 12 to 18 inclusively, in remote and isolated communities across Canada an opportunity to participate in a range of developmental activities in a formal setting. It also aims to engage them with their local communities.

==Overview==
The program was created between 1994 and 1998, and there are currently more than 4,200 Junior Canadian Rangers in 135 JCR Patrols in remote and isolated communities across Canada, many of which are in the territory of Nunavut, and with Ontario having almost 1,000 Junior Rangers across 20 First Nations in 2017. Only the provinces of Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia do not have JCRs. Junior Canadian Rangers are easily recognized by their green sweatshirts and ball caps.

Training is delivered to JCRs by Canadian Rangers, civilian Adult Committee member, or community volunteers and is categorized under one of three &quot;circles of learning&quot;. These are: Community Traditional skills, Canadian Ranger skills, and Life Skills. Most JCR Patrols conduct some training activities &quot;on the land&quot; to help prepare the youth to survive in the outdoors.

The JCR Program offers a series of Enhanced Training Sessions (summer camps), which are designed to &quot;expand the horizons&quot; of selected youth by offering training, recreational, and cultural opportunities that may not be available in their local community.

The JCR Program is funded by the Government of Canada, through DND and the Canadian Armed Forces. The Canadian Ranger Patrol Groups, under command of the Canadian Army, oversees the conduct of the program at a regional or provincial level.

<doc id="617507" wikidata="Q918355" url="?curid=617507" title="Stanislas de Boufflers">
<text>Stanislas Jean, chevalier de Boufflers (31 May 1738, Nancy – 18 January 1815) was a French statesman and writer.

==Biography==
He was born near Nancy, Meurthe-et-Moselle, the son of Louis François, marquis de Boufflers. His mother, Marie Catherine de Beauveau Craon, was the mistress of Stanislas Leszczynski, and the boy was brought up at the court of Lunéville. He spent six months in study for the priesthood at Saint Sulpice, Paris, and during his residence there he circulated a story which became extremely popular, &quot;Aline, reine de Golconde&quot;.

Boufflers did not take priestly vows, as his ambitions were military. He entered the order of the Knights of Malta so that he could follow the career of arms without sacrificing the revenues of a benefice he had received in Lorraine from King Stanislas. After serving in various campaigns he reached the grade of &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1784, and in the next year was sent to West Africa as governor of Senegal. During his time in Senegal, he had a relationship with Anne Pépin, which has become famous. He proved an excellent administrator, and attempted to mitigate the horrors of the slave trade; and he tried to open up the material resources of the colony so that his departure in 1787 was regarded as a real calamity by both colonists and Senegalese. On his return to France, he presented queen Marie Antoinette with an enslaved boy, Jean Amilcar, who became her foster child.

The &quot;Mémoires secrets&quot; of Louis Petit de Bachaumont suggest that Boufflers was sent to Senegal because he was in disgrace at court; but the real reason appears to have been a desire to pay his debts before his marriage with Mme de Sabran, which took place soon after his return to France. Boufflers was admitted to the Académie française in 1788, and subsequently became a member of the states-general. In 1789, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. During the French Revolution he took refuge with Prince Henry of Prussia.

At the Restoration, he was made joint-librarian of the Bibliothèque Mazarine. His wit and his skill in light verse had won him a great reputation, and he was one of the idols of the Parisian salons. His paradoxical character was described in an epigram attributed to Antoine de Rivarol, &quot;abbé libertin, militaire philosophe, diplomate chansonnier, émigré patriote, républicain courtisan.&quot;

==Works==
Boufflers&#x27; &quot;Œuvres completes&quot; (complete works) were published under his own supervision in 1803. A selection of his stories in prose and verse was edited by Eugène Asse in 1878; his &quot;Poèsies&quot; by Octave Uzanne in 1886; and the &quot;Correspondence inédite de la comtesse de Sabran et du chevalier de Boufflers&quot; (1778-1788), by E de Magnieu and Henri Prat in 1875.

<doc id="617508" wikidata="Q1754642" url="?curid=617508" title="The Girl in the Other Room">
<text>The Girl in the Other Room is the seventh studio album by Canadian singer Diana Krall, released on March 31, 2004, by Verve Records. In addition to cover versions, it is Krall&#x27;s first (and as of 2025 only) album to include original material, which she co-wrote with her husband Elvis Costello.

==Background==
Krall wrote some of the songs for the album with her husband, English musician Elvis Costello. Krall told &quot;USA Today&quot; that she had wanted to try songwriting before but lacked the confidence. &quot;I started writing when I was a student but didn&#x27;t really have the confidence to [pursue] lyric-writing in great depth. I&#x27;ve never done anything so personal.&quot;

On the Verve Records website, Krall explains the songwriting for the album in more detail: &quot;I wrote the music and then Elvis and I talked about what we wanted to say. I told him stories and wrote pages and pages of reminiscences, descriptions and images, and he put them into tighter lyrical form. For &#x27;Departure Bay&#x27;, I wrote down a list of things that I love about home, things I realized were different, even exotic, now that I&#x27;ve been away.&quot;

&quot;Departure Bay&quot; is written about her hometown of Nanaimo, British Columbia, on Vancouver Island and the first Christmas without her mother and finishes the album. The penultimate song on the album, &quot;I&#x27;m Coming Through&quot;, is also about the death of her mother.

As well as the songs she co-wrote with Costello, Krall departs from the standards she has sung on previous albums by performing songs by contemporary performers such as Costello, Tom Waits, and Joni Mitchell, as well as a Chris Smither song previously performed by Bonnie Raitt. She also covered Mose Allison&#x27;s &quot;Stop This World&quot;.

==Critical reception==

A reviewer of NPR commented, &quot;The release is a departure from her past work, in that it bypasses interpretations of jazz standards in favor of new songs written by Krall and her husband, Elvis Costello&quot;. Jum Santella of All About Jazz wrote, &quot;Some of the songs come from a different direction than her previous material. Nothing can change her core jazz focus, however. The spirit of Nat King Cole, Jimmy Rowles and Ray Brown continues to guide her at every turn&quot;. Linda Serck of &quot;musicOMH&quot; added, &quot;Yet this album doesn&#x27;t just take you on Krall&#x27;s journey, it&#x27;s not that self-indulgent. The lyrics are universal, the jazz a whole tapestry of moods. &quot;The Girl In The Other Room&quot; is a melancholy and beautifully-crafted body of work, full of evocative images and sounds. It not only shows Krall to be a superb song-writer but also the real woman behind that elegant poster-girl&quot;.

Pamela Winters of &quot;Paste&quot; stated, &quot;Diana Krall has been wowing mainstream audiences for the past decade with her smooth, spare sound. If you like your jazz tidy, shiny and highly competent, you probably already have her CDs cozied up to that well-worn copy of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. But if you&#x27;re among the music snobs who, when she married Elvis Costello, wondered, &#x27;What does he see in her?&#x27; &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; will attempt to answer your question.&quot; A reviewer of &quot;Cosmopolis&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; is no album for jazz purists. However, it should allow her definitively break into the fan base of popular music to which she gives new impulses and a rarely-heard quality&quot;.

<text>Christian Ludwig Brehm (24 January 1787 – 23 June 1864) was a German pastor and ornithologist. He was the father of the zoologist Alfred Brehm.

== Life ==
Brehm was born in Schönau near Gotha on 24 January 1787. He was educated at University of Jena to be ordained as minister at Renthendorf in 1813 where he remained until his death on 23 June 1864. He wrote &quot;Beiträge zur Vogelkunde&quot; (1820–22), which described 104 species of German birds in minute detail, and &quot;Handbuch der Naturgeschichte aller Vögel Deutschlands&quot; (1831) which described 900 bird species.

Brehm accumulated a collection of 15,000 birds until his death, which included samples from his son, Alfred Brehm. Alfred collected these birds from Sudan, Egypt, and throughout Europe. He offered these to the Berlin Zoological Museum in March 1835 because he feared that a storm would destroy his house, but the sale fell through. After his death, they remained in the attic of his house, where Otto Kleinschmidt discovered them some years later. Kleinschmidt persuaded Lord Rothschild to buy them in 1897; they consisted of 9,000 skins, and the collection arrived at his Natural History Museum at Tring in 1932. However, the collection returned to Germany, where it was moved to Museum Koenig, located in Bonn.

<text>Pierre du Ryer (c.1606 – 6 November 1658) was a French dramatist.

== Life and works==
Du Ryer was born in Paris in about 1606. His early comedies are loosely modelled on those of Alexandre Hardy, but after the production of the &quot;Cid&quot; (1636) he became an imitator of Pierre Corneille; this was the period when he produced his masterpiece &quot;Scévole&quot;, probably in 1644 (the date generally given is 1646). &quot;Alcione&quot; (1638) was so popular that the abbé d&#x27;Aubignac knew it by heart, and Queen Christina of Sweden is said to have had it read to her three times in one day.

Du Ryer was a prolific dramatist. Among his other works were &quot;Saül&quot; (printed 1642), and a comedy, &quot;Les Vendanges de Suresnes&quot; (1635 or 1636). He died in Paris in 1658.

<doc id="617522" wikidata="Q72599" url="?curid=617522" title="Issai Schur">
<text>Issai Schur (10 January 1875 – 10 January 1941) was a Russian mathematician who worked in Germany for most of his life. He studied at the University of Berlin. He obtained his doctorate in 1901, became lecturer in 1903 and, after a stay at the University of Bonn, professor in 1919.

As a student of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, he worked on group representations (the subject with which he is most closely associated), but also in combinatorics and number theory and even theoretical physics. He is perhaps best known today for his result on the existence of the Schur decomposition and for his work on group representations (Schur&#x27;s lemma).

Schur published under the name of both I. Schur, and J. Schur, the latter especially in &quot;Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik&quot;. This has led to some confusion.

==Childhood==
Issai Schur was born into a Jewish family, the son of the businessman Moses Schur and his wife Golde Schur (née Landau). He was born in Mogilev on the Dnieper River in what was then the Russian Empire. Schur used the name &quot;Schaia &quot; (&quot;Isaiah&quot; as the epitaph on his grave) rather than &quot;Issai&quot; up in his middle twenties. Schur&#x27;s father may have been a wholesale merchant.

In 1888, at the age of 13, Schur went to Liepāja (Courland, now in Latvia), where his married sister and his brother lived, 640 km north-west of Mogilev. Kurland was one of the three Baltic governorates of Tsarist Russia, and since the Middle Ages the Baltic Germans were the upper social class. The local Jewish community spoke mostly German and not Yiddish.

Schur attended the German-speaking Nicolai Gymnasium in Libau from 1888 to 1894 and reached the top grade in his final examination, and received a gold medal. Here he became fluent in German.

==Education==
In October 1894, Schur attended the University of Berlin, with concentration in mathematics and physics. In 1901, he graduated summa cum laude under Frobenius and Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs with his dissertation &quot;On a class of matrices that can be assigned to a given matrix&quot;, which contains a general theory of the representation of linear groups. According to Vogt, he began to use the name &quot;Issai&quot; at this time. Schur thought that his chance of success in the Russian Empire was rather poor, and because he spoke German so perfectly, he remained in Berlin. He graduated in 1903 and was a lecturer at the University of Berlin. Schur held a position as professor at the Berlin University for the ten years from 1903 to 1913.

In 1913 he accepted an appointment as associate professor and successor of Felix Hausdorff at the University of Bonn. In the following years Frobenius tried various ways to get Schur back to Berlin. Among other things, Schur&#x27;s name was mentioned in a letter dated 27 June 1913 from Frobenius to Robert Gnehm (the School Board President of the ETH) as a possible successor to Carl Friedrich Geiser. Frobenius complained that they had never followed his advice before and then said: &quot;That is why I can&#x27;t even recommend Prof. J. Schur (now in Bonn) to you. He&#x27;s too good for Zurich, and should be my successor in Berlin&quot;. Hermann Weyl got the job in Zurich. The efforts of Frobenius were finally successful in 1916, when Schur succeeded Johannes Knoblauch as adjunct professor. Frobenius died a year later, on 3 August 1917. Schur and Carathéodory were both named as the frontrunners for his successor. But they chose Constantin Carathéodory in the end. In 1919 Schur finally received a personal professorship, and in 1921 he took over the chair of the retired Friedrich Hermann Schottky. In 1922, he was also added to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.

==During the time of Nazism==
After the takeover by the Nazis and the elimination of the parliamentary opposition, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on 7 April 1933, prescribed the release of all distinguished public servants that held unpopular political opinions or who were &quot;Jewish&quot; in origin; a subsequent regulation extended this to professors and therefore also to Schur. Schur was suspended and excluded from the university system. His colleague Erhard Schmidt fought for his reinstatement, and since Schur had been a Prussian official before the First World War, he was allowed to participate in certain special lectures on teaching in the winter semester of 1933/1934 again. Schur withdrew his application for leave from the Science Minister and passed up the offer of a visiting professorship at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for the academic year 1933–34. One element that likely played a role in the rejection of the offer was that Schur no longer felt he could cope with the requirements that would have come with a new beginning in an English-speaking environment.

Already in 1932, Schur&#x27;s daughter Hilde had married the doctor Chaim Abelin in Bern. As a result, Issai Schur visited his daughter in Bern several times. In Zurich he met often with George Pólya, with whom he was on friendly terms since before the First World War.

On such a trip to Switzerland in the summer of 1935, a letter reached Schur from Ludwig Bieberbach signed on behalf of the Rector&#x27;s, stating that Schur should urgently seek him out in the University of Berlin. They needed to discuss an important matter with him. It involved Schur&#x27;s dismissal on 30 September 1935.

Schur remained a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences after his release as a professor, but a little later he lost this last remnant of his official position. Due to an intervention from Bieberbach in the spring of 1938 he was forced to explain his resignation from the commission of the Academy. His membership in the Advisory Board of Mathematische Zeitschrift was ended in early 1939.

==Emigration==

Schur found himself lonely after the flight of many of his students and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer. The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo, in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin and went with medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration: emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur&#x27;s wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day it does not seem to be clear who were the donors.

Schur was able to leave Germany in early 1939. His health, however, was already severely compromised. He traveled in the company of a nurse to his daughter in Bern, where his wife also followed a few days later. There they remained for several weeks and then emigrated to Palestine. Two years later, on his 66th birthday, on 10 January 1941, he died in Tel Aviv of a heart attack.

==Work==
Schur continued the work of his teacher Frobenius with many important works for group theory and representation theory. In addition, he published important results and elegant proofs of known results in almost all branches of classical algebra and number theory. His collected works are proof of this. There, his work on the theory of integral equations and infinite series can be found.

===Linear groups===
In his doctoral thesis &quot;Über eine Klasse von Matrizen, die sich einer gegebenen Matrix zuordnen lassen&quot; Issai Schur determined the polynomial representations of the general linear group formula_1 on the field formula_2 of complex numbers. The results and methods of this work are still relevant today. In his book, J.A. Green determined the polynomial representations of formula_3 over infinite fields formula_4 with arbitrary characteristic. It is mainly based on Schur&#x27;s dissertation. Green writes, &quot;This remarkable work (of Schur) contained many very original ideas, developed with superb algebraic skill. Schur showed that these (polynomial) representations are completely reducible, that each irreducible one is &quot;homogeneous&quot; of some degree formula_5, and that the equivalence types of irreducible polynomial representations of formula_6, of fixed homogeneous degree formula_7, are in one-one correspondence with the partitions formula_8 of formula_7 into not more than formula_10 parts. Moreover Schur showed that the character of an irreducible representation of type formula_11 is given by a certain symmetric function formula_12 in formula_10 variables (since described as a &quot;Schur function&quot;).&quot; According to Green, the methods of Schur&#x27;s dissertation today are important for the theory of algebraic groups.

In 1927 Schur, in his work &quot;On the rational representations of the general linear group&quot;, gave new proofs for the main results of his dissertation. If formula_14 is the natural formula_10-dimensional formula_2 vector space on which formula_1 operates, and if formula_7 is a natural number, then the formula_7-fold tensor product formula_20 over formula_2 is a formula_22-module, on which the symmetric group formula_23 of degree formula_7 also operates by permutation of the tensor factors of each generator formula_25 of formula_20. By exploiting these formula_27-bimodule actions on formula_20, Schur manages to find elegant proofs of his sentences. This work of Schur was once very well known.

===Professorship in Berlin===
Schur lived in Berlin as a highly respected member of the academic world, an apolitical scholar. A leading mathematician and outstanding and very successful teacher, he held a prestigious chair at the University of Berlin for 16 years. Until 1933, his research group had an excellent reputation at the University of Berlin in Germany and beyond. With Schur in the center, his faculty worked with representation theory, which was extended by his students in different directions (including solvable groups, combinatorics, matrix theory). Schur made fundamental contributions to algebra and group theory which, according to Hermann Weyl, were comparable in scope and depth to those of Emmy Noether (1882–1935).

When Schur&#x27;s lectures were canceled in 1933, there was an outcry among the students and professors who appreciated him and liked him. By the efforts of his colleague Erhard Schmidt Schur was allowed to continue lecturing until the end of September 1935. Schur was the last Jewish professor who lost his job.

===Zurich lecture===
In Switzerland, Schur&#x27;s colleagues Heinz Hopf and George Pólya were informed of the dismissal of Schur in 1935. They tried to help as best they could. On behalf of the Mathematical Seminars chief Michel Plancherel, on 12 December 1935 the school board president Arthur Rohn invited Schur to &quot;une série de conférences sur la théorie de la représentation des groupes finis&quot;. At the same time he asked that the formal invitation should come from President Rohn, &quot;comme le prof. Schur doit obtenir l&#x27;autorisation du ministère compétent de donner ces conférences&quot;. George Pólya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on 16 December. Meanwhile, on 14 December the official invitation letter from President Rohn had already been dispatched to Schur. Schur was promised for his guest lecture a fee of CHF 500.

Schur did not reply until 28 January 1936, on which day he was first in the possession of the required approval of the local authority. He declared himself willing to accept the invitation. He envisaged beginning the lecture on 4 February. Schur spent most of the month of February in Switzerland. Before his return to Germany he visited his daughter in Bern for a few days, and on 27 February he returned via Karlsruhe, where his sister lived, to Berlin. In a letter to Pólya from Berne, he concludes with the words: &quot;From Switzerland I take farewell with a heavy heart&quot;.

In Berlin, meanwhile, mathematician and Nazi Ludwig Bieberbach, in a letter dated 20 February 1936, informed the Reich Minister for Science, Art, and Education on the journey of Schur, and announced that he wanted to find out what was the content of the lecture in Zurich.

===Quotes===
In his commemorative speech, Alfred Brauer (PhD candidate of Schur) spoke about Issai Schur as follows: &quot;As a teacher, Schur was excellent. His lectures were very clear, but not always easy and required cooperation – During the winter semester of 1930, the number of students who wanted to attend Schur&#x27;s theory of numbers lecture, was such that the second largest university lecture hall with about 500 seats was too small. His most human characteristics were probably his great modesty, his helpfulness and his human interest in his students.&quot;

Heinz Hopf, who had been in Berlin before his appointment to Zurich at the ETH Privatdozent, held – as is clear from oral statements and also from letters – Issai Schur as a mathematician and greatly appreciated man. Here, this appreciation was based entirely on reciprocity: in a letter of 1930 to George Pólya on the occasion of the re-appointment of Hermann Weyl, Schur says of Hopf: &quot;Hopf is a very excellent teacher, a mathematician of strong temperament and strong effect, a master&#x27;s discipline, trained excellent in other areas. – If I have to characterize him as a man, it may suffice if I say that I sincerely look forward to each time I meet with him&quot;.

Schur was, however, known for putting a correct distance in personal affairs. The testimony of Hopf is in accordance with statements of Schur&#x27;s former students in Berlin, by Walter Ledermann and Bernhard Neumann.

<text>Anatoly Borisovich Chubais (; born 16 June 1955) is a Russian-Israeli politician and economist who was responsible for privatization in Russia as an influential member of Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s administration in the early 1990s. During this period, he was a key figure in introducing a market economy and the principles of private ownership to Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. He has the federal state civilian service rank of 1st class Active State Councillor of the Russian Federation. He fled to Israel in 2022 and subsequently obtained Israeli citizenship.

From 1998 to 2008, he headed the state-owned electrical power monopoly RAO UES. A 2004 survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the &quot;Financial Times&quot; named Chubais the world&#x27;s 54th most respected business leader. He was the head of the Russian Nanotechnology Corporation (RUSNANO) from 2008 to 2020.

In December 2020, he was appointed a special representative of the Russian president for relations with international organisations to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. He resigned from this position in March 2022 and left Russia after opposing the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to media reports. He is the highest ranked Russian figure to have resigned due to the invasion.

Chubais was a member of the Advisory Council for JPMorgan Chase from September 2008 until 2013. He is a long-time participant and speaker of the Bilderberg Club. On 30 May 2024, he took part in the club&#x27;s 70th anniversary meeting in Madrid, Spain. That same year, he founded the Center for Russian Studies (CRS) at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Tel Aviv University. He is currently an acting member of The Global Board of Advisors of the Council on Foreign Relations.

==Early life==

Chubais was born on 16 June 1955 in the town of Borisov, Belarus, which was then part of the Soviet Union, the son of Raisa Efimovna (Sagal) and Boris Matveyevich Chubais. Though his mother received a degree in economics at university, she opted to stay home to care for their children on the military bases where her husband was regularly assigned. Anatoly Chubais has an older brother, Igor Chubais (born 1947), a philosopher. Chubais&#x27; background is Jewish.

In 1977, Chubais graduated from the Leningrad Institute of Engineering and Economics (LEEI) in present-day St. Petersburg and joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until 1991 when he left it.

==Career==

=== Early career (1977–1991) ===
While later working at LEEI, Chubais started a club called Reforma, which helped turn the city of Leningrad into a model of political reform by constructing platforms for both local and national elections. Reforma also engaged in drafting reformist legislation, an important step down the road when Chubais would work in the city government. In 1982, he attained the rank of associate professor (доцент) at LEEI, while in 1983, he received his Candidate of Sciences (Ph.D.) degree in Economics for the dissertation entitled &quot;Исследование и разработка методов планирования совершенствования управления в отраслевых научно-технических организациях&quot; (Research and Development of Methods for the Planned Improvement of Management in Industrial Research and Development Organizations).

Starting in the early 1980s, Chubais became a leader of an informal circle of market-oriented economists in Leningrad. In 1982, together with economists Yury Yarmagayev and Grigory Glazkov, he published an article titled &quot;Вопросы расширения хозяйственной самостоятельности предприятий в условиях научно-технического прогресса&quot; (Questions of Expanding the Autonomy of Business Enterprises under the conditions of Scientific and Technological Progress) in which the authors argue that no amount of central planning can predict the end-demand for products. In 1982, Chubais was introduced to the future Prime Minister of Russia Yegor Gaidar, who was invited to and attended seminars led by Chubais.

By 1987, Chubais had become the organiser of the Leningrad chapter of the club Perestroyka, whose mission was to promote and discuss democratic ideas among the local intelligentsia. Among the people involved were his brother, Igor, who had founded the Moscow-based chapter of the Perestroyka and Perestroyka-88 clubs, future Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Kudrin, future Chubais associates Pyotr Mostovoy and Alexander Kazakov, the future President of Saint Petersburg bank Vladimir Kogan, future Minister of Anti-Monopoly Policy and Entrepreneurship Support Ilya Yuzhanov, and future Deputy Governor of Saint Petersburg Mikhail Manevich.

The dissident economists organized a tulip farm to finance their seminars. In the four days before the International Women&#x27;s Day (8 March), they managed to get income equivalent to the price of several Lada cars. The tulip money was used to finance the elections of Anatoly Sobchak, Yury Boldyrev and many other democratic candidates. As a result, 2/3 of the deputies winning the 1990 elections to Leningrad Soviet were from the opposition. Chubais himself later stated that he personally did not participate in growing or selling of the flowers.

At the end of 1990, the economist Vitaly Nayshul proposed the idea of using vouchers to facilitate mass privatization in order to transform the Soviet Union into a market economy. Chubais strongly criticized the scheme at the time, citing the inevitable inequality and social tensions that would result if implemented as proposed. Ironically, Chubais would later become the champion of the same concept just several years later.

=== Privatization chief in Leningrad (1990–1994) ===
In 1990, upon the election of Anatoly Sobchak as Chairman of the Leningrad City Council, Chubais assumed the position of his Deputy. He was trying to implement Sobchak&#x27;s idea of creating a Free Economic Zone in Leningrad. In 1991, Chubais declined the offer to become the Chairman of the Leningrad Executive Committee to instead become an advisor to the mayoral administration in Leningrad (by now renamed St. Petersburg) where Sobchak had just been elected mayor. At the same time, Chubais worked as the president of newly established Wassily Leontief Center for Research in Economics.

=== In Yeltsin government (1992–1999) ===

In November 1991, Chubais became a minister in the Yeltsin Cabinet where he managed the portfolio of Rosimushchestvo (the Committee for the Management of State Property) which was handling privatization in Russia.

Chubais originally advocated rapid privatization in order to raise revenue, similar to the model used in Hungary. However, the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of Russia rejected this model. Eventually, a compromise was proposed in the form of a voucher privatization program akin to the program used in the Czech Republic at the time. On 11 June 1991, the Supreme Soviet of Russia adopted this compromise and the massive program was officially initiated by decree of President Boris Yeltsin on 19 August 1991. This privatization program later came under heavy criticism. While most Russian citizens lost their savings in only a few weeks, a few oligarchs rapidly became billionaires by arbitraging the vast difference between the old domestic prices for Russian commodities versus the prices prevailing on the world market. The people who benefited from this arbitrage became known as &quot;kleptocrats&quot; because they stashed billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts rather than investing in the Russian economy.

From November 1994 until January 1996, Chubais held the position of deputy prime minister for economic and financial policy in the Russian government. Thanks to liberalizing reforms carried out in 1995, the Russian Government was finally enjoying a measure of financial stability, something its politicians had been seeking ever since the resignation of Yegor Gaidar in 1993. By the end of 1995, the average annual inflation rate had declined from 18% down to 3%.

From April 1995 until February 1996, Chubais also represented Russia in two international financial institutions – the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).

After resigning as deputy prime minister in January 1996, Chubais agreed to manage Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s reelection campaign. By this time according to public opinion surveys, Yeltsin&#x27;s approval rating had fallen to roughly 3%. Chubais established the Civil Society Foundation as well as Yeltsin&#x27;s Campaign Analytical Group, which became one part of the Foundation. The group helped Yeltsin regain popularity and win re-election in the second round of the polls on 3 July 1994, capturing 53.82% of the popular vote.

From July 1996 until March 1997, Chubais was the chief of the Presidential Administration of Russia. During his tenure, his office grew increasingly influential.

Chubais participated in the Bilderberg Club session in Turnberry, Scotland in 1998, and co-chaired the Round Table of Industrialists of Russia and the EU during the joint session of the Government Commission of the Russian Federation and the European Union. He was also elected to the Board of Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs in 2000.

According to Yeltsin&#x27;s daughter and chief of staff Tatyana Yumasheva, Chubais opposed the nomination of Vladimir Putin as Prime Minister of Russia and Yeltsin&#x27;s successor in 1999. Although Chubais believed Putin was qualified for the position, he feared that his appointment would be rejected by the State Duma, allow the Communist Party of the Russian Federation to gain a large enough parliamentary majority to amend the constitution, and start a civil war.

=== RAO Unified Energy System of Russia (1998–2008) ===

In 1998, Chubais was elected to the chairman of the board of RAO UES of Russia, the state-owned electricity monopoly, at a special general meeting of shareholders; he soon was also appointed chairman of the board.

Since 2000, Chubais consistently defended the need for further reform, which included dis-aggregating power generation, transmission, and distribution activities from the monopoly holding company in order to facilitate the subsequent sale of a majority of shares to private investors. Chubais was convinced that the un-bundling and privatization of the state monopoly were the only mechanisms able to raise the substantial funds needed to modernize Russia&#x27;s electricity sector.

He was elected president of the CIS Electric Power Council (2000), and later was repeatedly re-elected to that post from 2001 to 2004.

In addition to reforms, Chubais and his team raised more than $30 billion in private investments for the Russian electric power sector. The funds were used to finance the construction of new facilities: 130 new units with a total capacity of about 29,000 MW, 10,000 kilometers of transmission lines, 60,000 kilometers of distribution network lines, and thousands of electrical sub-stations of all classes of voltage. His reforms also helped eliminate the use of barter payments and significantly reduced the number of payment defaults in the sector.

On 17 March 2005, he survived an assassination attempt. Vladimir Kvachkov was charged for the crime, but was acquitted by a jury.

In 2007, the Russian newspaper Vedomosti named Chubais the &quot;Professional of the Year&quot;. The paper called him the only professional reformer in Russia because of his achievements in breaking of one monopoly into dozens of independent entities, introducing market forces into the electricity distribution system, and transforming a government institution structure into one attractive for private investment and management.

In July 2008, RAO UES of Russia ceased to exist as a legal entity.

=== RUSNANO (2008–2020) ===

Since September 2008, Chubais has been General Manager of the State Corporation Rosnanotech.

The official business of the corporation is to promote innovation and modernization in Russia&#x27;s economy in several areas. For example, RUSNANO forms an important part of the government&#x27;s strategy to find economic alternatives to fossil fuels. The corporation has set a target of 900 billions rubles in sales by 2015. In the past, Chubais has compared RUSNANO to a garden in which the corporation cultivates innovative business ventures. Over its eight years of operation (2007–2015), RUSNANO has completed over 100 investment projects which resulted in the opening of 68 new plants and 28 R&amp;D centers. As stated in the annual RUSNANO groups&#x27; financial report, the value of RUSNANO&#x27;s portfolio was estimated in 2015 at 227.7 billion rubles and its net income at 17 billion rubles.

Chubais has been a member of the Skolkovo Foundation Council since 2010, and in 2011 was elected chairman of the board of LTD RUSNANO.

He left the organization in December 2020.

=== Resignation (2022) ===
On 22 March 2022, after Russia launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, Chubais quit his official positions, including that as special representative, stating that he was opposed to the invasion, according to media reports. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Chubais had resigned, but did not specify why, stating: &quot;Whether he left or not is his personal matter&quot;. Chubais left Russia, arriving in Istanbul, Turkey, on the same day, planning to remain abroad. Alexei Navalny&#x27;s spokesperson, Kira Yarmysh, suggested that Chubais had &quot;left Russia only out of fear for his own skin and his own money&quot;. He was the highest ranked Kremlin official to resign following the start of the invasion, though he is not a member of Putin&#x27;s inner circle. He now lives in Israel.

=== Independent researcher (2023) ===
In the summer of 2023, Chubais published an article in the Russian academic journal &quot;Voprosy Ekonomiki&quot; on the problem of non-payments in the Russian economy in the early 1990s. The author positions himself as an independent researcher from the UK.

=== Center for Russian Studies (2024) ===
On 16 April 2024, there was a presentation of the launch report of the new Center for Russian Studies (CRS) - Russian Future Initiative founded by Anatoly Chubays at the Faculty of Social Sciences at Tel Aviv University. The mission of the Center is a “comprehensive study of Russia&#x27;s possible future based on the analysis of the events of its recent past.”

Anatoly Chubays commented on the opening of the Center that “Russia is changing the direction of its development for the second time in the last 35 years. It is crucial now to rise above emotions, personal destinies, and political preferences and attempt to re-understand our recent history. Only in this way can we gain lessons that will truly be relevant in the future.”

==Personal life==

Chubais is married to Dunya Smirnova (a screenwriter and TV presenter) and has two children from his first marriage: a son, Aleksey, and a daughter, Olga.

On 1 August 2022, Chubais told Russian journalist Ksenia Sobchak that he had been hospitalised with the neurological disorder Guillain–Barré syndrome, though Sardinian newspaper &quot;L’Unione Sarda&quot; reported that Italian authorities had not yet ruled out poisoning, and Italian intelligence services are awaiting his blood toxicology results in order to make sure he was not poisoned.

==Involvement in political parties==

In June 1993, Anatoly Chubais co-founded the &quot;Russia&#x27;s Choice&quot; electoral bloc (Vybor Rossii), which was headed by Yegor Gaidar. In December 1993, running under this bloc, Chubais was elected as a deputy to the Russian State Duma in its first convocation.

On 12–13 July 1994, Chubais was elected to the governing council of the party &quot;Democratic Choice of Russia&quot;, which had been built off the electoral bloc &quot;Russia&#x27;s Choice&quot;. In December 1998, Chubais became a member of the Organizing Committee of Right Cause coalition and was elected to the Steering Committee of the Organizing Committee of this coalition.

In July 1996, Chubais founded the &quot;Center for Protection of Private Property&quot; Foundation.

In May 2000, Chubais was elected co-chairman of the Coordinating Council of the Russian National Political Organization &quot;Union of Right Forces&quot; at its founding congress. He was also later elected co-president and a member of the Federal Political Council on 26 May 2001, during the founding congress of the &quot;Union of Right Forces&quot; Party (SPS).

On 24 January 2004, he resigned from his post as co-chair of the party but remained on the Federal Political Council of the SPS party.

In May 2010, Chubais became the chairman of the board of trustees of the Gaidar Foundation, jointly established by the Gaidar Institute for Economic Policy and Maria Strugatsky.

==Assassination attempts==
In November 2004, in an interview with &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Chubais said: &quot;I know of at least three orders for my murder. I know all the details, the names of those who were supposed to carry them out. The last such order was made a year and a half ago. It had purely political motives: hatred because I &quot;sold Russia.&quot; When every day, returning home, you assume that a killer with an anti-tank grenade launcher could be around the corner, then your perception of political risks changes. Yes, perhaps today, the risk is several percent higher than in 2000. But in 1992-1999, the risk was several times greater.&quot;

Six months later, in March 2005, an attempt was made on Chubais. On the route of his car near the village of Zhavoronki, Odintsovsky District, Moscow Oblast, an explosive device with a capacity of 3 to 12 kg of TNT was detonated, followed by machine gun fire. Chubais and his companions were saved by the fact that the car they were in was armored.

The president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Arkady Volsky, said that the people behind the attempt on Chubais were &quot;those whom we often see on TV, whose names appear in the media.&quot; Nikolay Kovalyov, then the former head of the Federal Security Service and chairman of the State Duma Committee on Veterans Affairs, expressed the opinion that they did not want to kill Chubais, but to intimidate him, and the attack was ordered by the heads of energy companies who were dissatisfied with Chubais&#x27;s activities at RAO UES. On the contrary, Boris Nemtsov argued that the attempt on Chubais&#x27;s life was not related to his work at RAO, but &quot;was of a political nature,&quot; especially since the death threats repeatedly received by Chubais &quot;came from his political enemies.&quot; Vyacheslav Volodin, then Vice-Speaker of the State Duma from the United Russia faction, suggested that the people behind the assassination attempt were &quot;new candidates for the role of sponsors of the right&quot;: Boris Berezovsky and Leonid Nevzlin.

Charges for the assassination attempt were brought against retired GRU colonel Vladimir Kvachkov, former officers of the 45th Airborne Regiment R. P. Yashin and A. I. Naidenov, as well as member of the executive committee of the Congress of Russian Communities Ivan Mironov, the son of the former Chairman of the Press Committee Boris Mironov. The investigation was conducted by the Department for Investigation of Particularly Important Cases of the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office of the Russian Federation. According to investigators, the crime was committed on the basis of extremist views and hostility towards Chubais. In March 2006, the Moscow Regional Court began to consider the criminal case against Kvachkov, Yashin, and Naydenov with the participation of a jury. The criminal case against Ivan Mironov was separated into separate proceedings. The defendants were charged under five articles of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation: encroachment on the life of a statesman or public figure (Article 277); attempted murder (Art. 30, Part 3; Art. 105, Part 2); illegal acquisition and storage of weapons and explosives (Art. 222, Part 3); intentional destruction and damage to property (Art. 167, Part 2).

On 20 December 2006, the jury was dismissed after a prosecution witness recanted his testimony given during the investigation that he had heard the defendants talking about their intention to commit an attempt on Chubais. The defendants&#x27; lawyers believed that the witness testified during the investigation under pressure. Representatives of Chubais believed that unprecedented pressure was exerted by the defense on the jury. On December 6, the second jury was dissolved: it turned out that one of the jurors could not serve as a jury by law, since she was registered in a drug dispensary. On 5 June 2008, the third jury returned a not guilty verdict to all three defendants, recognizing the charges against them as unproven.

In an interview with Echo of Moscow on the first day after his release, Kvachkov said that he considered himself a Russian nationalist and stated: &quot;I did not want to kill Anatoly Borisovich Chubais, but I would like him to stand trial and be hanged.&quot; Kvachkov explained: &quot;the destruction of Chubais is not a crime for me,&quot; since &quot;Chubais is a national traitor,&quot; and &quot;Russia is occupied by the Jewish mafia.&quot;

On 25 June 2008, the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office appealed the acquittal in the case of the attempt on Chubais. On 26 August 2008, the Supreme Court overturned the acquittal and sent the case for a new trial to the Moscow Regional Court. The charges against Ivan Mironov were combined with the charges against the other defendants. On 29 September 2010, the jury again acquitted the defendants. On 22 December 2010, the Supreme Court rejected the cassation appeal of the Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office against the acquittal. Thus, the accused were finally acquitted.

On 23 December 2010, Kvachkov was detained on charges of organizing rebellion and terrorism. On 8 February 2013, the Moscow City Court sentenced him to 13 years in prison for preparing to organize an armed rebellion. Later, the Supreme Court of Russia reduced the sentence to eight years in prison.

==Sanctions==
In November 2023, Chubais was added to Ukraine&#x27;s sanctions list.

==Awards==

In 1997, the British magazine Euromoney named him the world&#x27;s best Minister of Finance.

In December 2001, Chubais was awarded an honorary diploma of International Award by the International Union of Economists for his significant contributions to the Russian Federation, specifically his work applying advanced international experience to introduce contemporary methods of organizing administration, economics, finances and production processes.

In 2008, Chubais was awarded a Presidential Commendation for helping draft part of the Russian Constitution as well as his overall contributions to democracy in Russia.

In 2010, Chubais was honored by with IV degree Order For Merit to the Fatherland &quot;for outstanding contribution to the implementation of state policy in the field of nanotechnology and many years of favorable work&quot;.

Chubais received three presidential commendations (awarded in 1995, 1997 and 1998) and as well as one honorary Ph.D. from the St. Petersburg State Engineering and Economic University.

<text>Ichthyosis vulgaris (also known as &quot;autosomal dominant ichthyosis&quot; and &quot;Ichthyosis simplex&quot;) is a skin disorder causing dry, scaly skin. It is the most common form, and one of the mildest forms, of ichthyosis, affecting around 1 in 250 people. For this reason it is known as common ichthyosis. It is usually an autosomal dominant inherited disease (often associated with filaggrin), although a rare non-heritable version called acquired ichthyosis exists.

==Presentation==

Ichthyosis vulgaris is the most common type within the ichthyoses, a diverse group of inherited skin disorders characterized by the way the skin produces keratin. These conditions all share the common trait of causing generalized skin scaling, which can range in its intensity. In comparison to the other forms of ichthyosis, IV is generally viewed as the least severe. The symptoms of the inherited form of ichthyosis vulgaris are not usually present at birth but generally develop between three months and five years of age. The symptoms will often improve with age, although they may grow more severe again in old age. But when Ichthyosis vulgaris is typically  in infancy signs like skin dryness (xerosis), skin lesions, keratosis pilaris (small skin bumps), thickened skin on the palms and soles (palmoplantar hyperlinearity), scaly skin (scaly dermatosis), and, in severe cases, red and inflamed skin (erythroderma) become apparent, usually by age 5. While most individuals with this condition can expect a regular lifespan, potential complications include vitamin D deficiency and hearing problems due to ear scaling. Furthermore, the visible changes in the skin can significantly diminish a person&#x27;s quality of life. As the primary therapeutic approach, physicians often recommend using creams containing 10% urea, along with ceramides and other moisturising compounds, to manage ichthyosis vulgaris.

The condition is not life-threatening; the impact on the patient, if it is a mild case, is generally restricted to mild itching and the social impact of having skin with an unusual appearance. People with mild cases have symptoms that include scaly patches on the shins, fine white scales on the forearms and upper arms, and rough palms. People with the mildest cases have no symptoms other than faint, tell-tale &quot;mosaic lines&quot; between the Achilles tendons and the calf muscles.

Severe cases, although rare, do exist. Severe cases entail the buildup of scales everywhere, with areas of the body that have a concentration of sweat glands being the least affected. Areas where the skin rubs against together, such as the armpits, the groin, and the &quot;folded&quot; areas of the elbow and knees, are less affected. Various topical treatments are available to &quot;exfoliate&quot; the scales. These include lotions that contain alpha-hydroxy acids.

===Associated conditions===
Many people with severe ichthyosis have problems sweating due to the buildup of scales on the skin. This may lead to problems such as &quot;prickly itch&quot;, which results from the afflicted skin being unable to sweat due to the buildup of scales, or problems associated with overheating. The majority of people with vulgaris can sweat at least a little. Paradoxically this means most would be more comfortable living in a hot and humid climate. Sweating helps to shed scales, which improves the appearance of the skin and prevents &quot;prickly itch&quot;.

The dry skin will crack on the digits or extremities and create bloody cuts. Skin is painful when inflamed, tight, or both. For children and adolescents, psychological concerns may include inconsistent self-image, mood fluctuations due to cyclical outbreaks, a tendency to addiction, the possibility of social withdrawal when skin is noticeably infected, and preoccupation with appearance.

Strong air conditioning and excessive consumption of alcohol can also increase the buildup of scales.

Over 50% of people with ichthyosis vulgaris have some type of atopic disease such as allergies, eczema, or asthma. Another common condition associated with ichthyosis vulgaris is keratosis pilaris (small bumps mainly appearing on the back of the upper arms).

==Genetics==
Ichthyosis vulgaris is a common genetic disorder caused by a single gene. This disorder is thought to happen because of changes in the gene responsible for making a protein called profilaggrin, which later turns into filaggrin. Filaggrin plays a crucial role in how our skin is built. About 10% of people have some gene changes in the profilaggrin gene, and this can also be linked to another skin problem called atopic dermatitis, which often occurs along with ichthyosis vulgaris . We know the exact gene changes responsible for ichthyosis vulgaris in some cases, but not all of them.

Usually, ichthyosis vulgaris is considered a dominant condition, which means that just one gene change can lead to the disease, and someone with this change has a 50% chance of passing it on to their child. But there is some research suggesting it might be a bit more complex, where one gene change causes a mild form of the disease, and changes in both copies of the gene would cause a more severe case.

==Diagnosis==

Ichthyosis vulgaris is mainly diagnosed based on the clinical features of the patient mainly the physical exam findings and the personal and family histories. History of the age of the onset, and using family pedigree to clarify the pattern of inheritance can help to specify ichthyosis vulgaris among other types of ichthyoses. In some cases, it might be hard to clearly differentiate between ichthyosis vulgaris and other ichthyoses; a doctor can go request genetic testing or take a biopsy and make a histopathology examination, but even this test is still suggestive and not specific for ichthyosis vulgaris.

== Treatment ==
Hereditary ichthyosis vulgaris is a persistent condition that tends to improve with age but typically demands ongoing management. The seriousness of acquired ichthyosis, on the other hand, is generally linked to the underlying systemic condition. The primary approach for both forms involves maintaining skin hydration and applying ointments to prevent moisture loss. Hydration encourages skin shedding by enhancing the activity of certain enzymes and making the skin more responsive to mechanical forces. It also enhances the suppleness of the outermost skin layer.

For some patients, topical retinoids can be beneficial, while alpha-hydroxy acids such as lactic, glycolic, or pyruvic acids prove effective in moisturising the skin. They operate by breaking down skin cells in the lower layers of the newly formed outer skin layer. For example, lactic acid is available in a 12% ammonium lactate lotion or can be specially compounded at concentrations of 5–10% in a suitable base. Twice-daily applications have proven more effective than petroleum-based creams in managing ichthyosis vulgaris.

To help remove scales, keratolytics like salicylic acid can be useful as they induce the breakdown of skin cells in the upper skin layer. There is a commercially available 6% salicylic acid gel suitable for use on limited areas.

Many over-the-counter products contain either urea or propylene glycol. Moisturisers with lower-strength urea (10–20%) enhance the flexibility of the outer skin layer by acting as humectants. Propylene glycol, on the other hand, draws water through the outer skin layer, facilitating the shedding of thickened skin post-hydration. It is a common component in both prescription and over-the-counter products. A new emulsion containing urea (10%), ceramides, and natural moisturising factors, applied twice daily, can be beneficial for individuals with hyperkeratotic and dry skin.

Topical retinoids, like tretinoin, might also provide benefits, as they reduce the cohesion of skin cells, promote cell turnover, and inhibit the production of keratin. In some small trials, tazarotene, a selective topical retinoid, has demonstrated effectiveness. While steroids are generally ineffective for ichthyosis vulgaris, a mild topical steroid could be employed to relieve itching. In cases of acquired ichthyosis vulgaris, treatment primarily involves addressing the underlying systemic condition, often leading to symptom improvement. Ongoing research aims to assess and compare the physical and chemical properties of various topical emollients to determine their efficacy in managing ichthyosis vulgaris.

<text>Lead glass, commonly called crystal, is a variety of glass in which lead replaces the calcium content of a typical potash glass. Lead glass contains typically 18–40% (by mass) lead(II) oxide (PbO), while modern lead crystal, historically also known as flint glass due to the original silica source, contains a minimum of 24% PbO. Lead glass is often desirable for a variety of uses due to its clarity. In marketing terms it is often called crystal glass.

The term &quot;lead crystal&quot; is, technically, not an accurate term to describe lead glass, because glass lacks a crystalline structure and is instead an amorphous solid. The use of the term remains popular for historical and commercial reasons, but is sometimes changed to simply &quot;crystal&quot; because of lead&#x27;s reputation as a toxic substance. It is retained from the Venetian word to describe the rock crystal (quartz) imitated by Murano glassmakers. This naming convention has been maintained to the present day to describe decorative holloware.

Lead crystal glassware was formerly used to store and serve drinks, but due to the health risks of lead, this has become rare. One alternative material is modern crystal glass, in which barium oxide, zinc oxide, or potassium oxide are employed instead of lead oxide.

In the European Union, labelling of &quot;crystal&quot; products is regulated by Council Directive 69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition and properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% of lead oxide may be referred to as &quot;lead crystal&quot;. Products with less lead oxide, or glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be labelled &quot;crystalline&quot; or &quot;crystal glass&quot;.

==Properties==
The addition of lead oxide to glass raises its refractive index and lowers its working temperature and viscosity. The attractive optical properties of lead glass result from the high content of the heavy metal lead. Lead also raises the density of the glass, being over 7 times as dense as calcium. The density of soda glass is or below, while typical lead crystal has a density of around and high-lead glass can be over or even up to .

The brilliance of lead crystal relies on the high refractive index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive (&quot;n&quot;) of 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures the degree to which a medium separates light into its component wavelengths, thus producing a spectrum, just as a prism does. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet in cut glass reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system if it is to be achromatic.

The addition of lead oxide to potash glass also reduces its viscosity, rendering it more fluid than ordinary soda glass above softening temperature (about ), with a working point of . The viscosity of glass varies radically with temperature, but that of lead glass is roughly two orders of magnitude lower than that of ordinary soda glasses across working temperature ranges (up to ). From the glassmaker&#x27;s perspective, this results in two practical developments. First, lead glass may be worked at a lower temperature, leading to its use in enamelling, and second, clear vessels may be made without trapped air bubbles with less difficulty than ordinary glasses, allowing the manufacture of perfectly clear, flawless objects.

When tapped, lead crystal makes a ringing sound, unlike ordinary glasses. The wine glasses were always valued also for their &quot;ring&quot; made by the clinking glasses. The sound was better when large quantity of the lead oxide was present in the glassmaking material, like in the British and Irish wine glasses of the 17th-19th centuries with their &quot;rich bell-notes of F and G sharp&quot;. Consumers still rely on this property to distinguish it from cheaper glasses. Emil Deeg had published a major study on the ringing of the lead crystal in 1958.
Since the potassium ions are bound more tightly in a lead-silica matrix than in a soda–lime glass, the former absorbs more energy when struck. This causes the lead crystal to oscillate, thereby producing its characteristic sound. Lead also increases the solubility of tin, copper, and antimony, leading to its use in colored enamels and glazes. The low viscosity of lead glass melt is the reason for typically high lead oxide content in the glass solders.
The presence of lead is used in glasses absorbing gamma radiation and X-rays, used in radiation shielding as a form of lead shielding (e.g. in cathode-ray tubes, thus lowering the exposure of the viewer to soft X-rays). In particle physics, the combination of the low radiation length resulting from the high density and presence of heavy nuclei with the high refractive index which leads to both pronounced Cherenkov radiation and containment of the Cherenkov light by total internal reflection makes lead glass one of the prominent tools for photon detection by means of electromagnetic showers.

The high ionic radius of the Pb2+ ion renders it highly immobile in the matrix and hinders the movement of other ions; lead glasses therefore have high electrical resistance, about two orders of magnitude higher than soda–lime glass (108.5 vs 106.5 ohm·cm, DC at ). Lead-containing glass is frequently used in light fixtures.

==History==
Lead may be introduced into glass either as an ingredient of the primary melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained from a variety of sources. In Europe, galena, lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be calcined to form lead oxide by roasting it and scraping off the litharge. In the medieval period lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver cupellation, and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.

Glasses with lead oxide content first appeared in Mesopotamia, the birthplace of the glass industry. The earliest known example is a blue glass fragment from Nippur dated to 1400 BC containing 3.66% PbO. Glass is mentioned in clay tablets from the reign of Assurbanipal (668–631 BC), and a recipe for lead glaze appears in a Babylonian tablet of 1700 BC. A red sealing-wax cake found in the Burnt Palace at Nimrud, from the early 6th century BC, contains 10% PbO. These low values suggest that lead oxide may not have been consciously added, and was certainly not used as the primary fluxing agent in ancient glasses.

Lead glass also occurs in Han-period China (206 BC – 220 AD). There, it was cast to imitate jade, both for ritual objects such as big and small figures, as well as jewellery and a limited range of vessels. Since glass first occurs at such a late date in China, it is thought that the technology was brought along the Silk Road by glassworkers from the Middle East. The fundamental compositional difference between Western silica-natron glass and the unique Chinese lead glass, however, may indicate an autonomous development.

In medieval and early modern Europe, lead glass was used as a base in coloured glasses, specifically in mosaic tesserae, enamels, stained-glass painting, and &quot;bijouterie&quot;, where it was used to imitate precious stones. Several textual sources describing lead glass survive. In the late 11th-early 12th century, &quot;Schedula Diversarum Artium&quot; (&quot;List of Sundry Crafts&quot;), the author known as &quot;Theophilus Presbyter&quot; describes its use as imitation gemstone, and the title of a lost chapter of the work mentions the use of lead in glass. The 12–13th century pseudonymous &quot;Heraclius&quot; details the manufacture of lead enamel and its use for window painting in his &quot;De coloribus et artibus Romanorum&quot; (&quot;Of Hues and Crafts of the Romans&quot;). This refers to lead glass as &quot;Jewish glass&quot;, perhaps indicating its transmission to Europe. A manuscript preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana, Venice, describes the use of lead oxide in enamels and includes recipes for calcining lead to form the oxide. Lead glass was ideally suited for enamelling vessels and windows owing to its lower working temperature than the forest glass of the body.

Antonio Neri devoted book four of his &quot;L’Arte Vetraria&quot; (&quot;The Art of Glass-making&quot;, 1612) to lead glass. In this first systematic treatise on glass, he again refers to the use of lead glass in enamels, glassware, and for the imitation of precious stones. Christopher Merrett translated this into English in 1662 (&quot;The Art of Glass&quot;), paving the way for the production of English lead crystal glass by George Ravenscroft.

George Ravenscroft (1618–1681) was the first to produce clear lead crystal glassware on an industrial scale. The son of a merchant with close ties to Venice, Ravenscroft had the cultural and financial resources necessary to revolutionise the glass trade, setting the basis from which England overtook Venice and Bohemia as the centre of the glass industry in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the aid of Venetian glassmakers, especially da Costa, and under the auspices of the Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers of London, Ravenscroft sought to find an alternative to Venetian cristallo. His use of flint as the silica source has led to the term flint glass to describe these crystal glasses, despite his later switch to sand. At first, his glasses tended to , developing a network of small cracks destroying its transparency, which was eventually overcome by replacing some of the potash flux with lead oxide to the melt, up to 30%. Crizzling results from the destruction of the glass network by an excess of alkali, and may be caused by excess humidity as well as inherent defects in glass composition. He was granted a protective patent in 1673, where production moved from his glasshouse in the precinct of the Savoy, London, to the seclusion of Henley-on-Thames. In 1676, having apparently overcome the crizzling problem, Ravenscroft was granted the use of a raven&#x27;s head seal as a guaranty of quality. In 1681, the year of his death, the patent expired and operations quickly developed among several firms, where by 1696 twenty-seven of the eighty-eight glasshouses in England, especially at London and Bristol, were producing flint glass containing 30–35% PbO.

At this period, glass was sold by weight, and the typical forms were rather heavy and solid with minimal decoration. Such was its success on the international market, however, that in 1746, the British Government imposed a lucrative tax by weight. Rather than drastically reduce the lead content of their glass, manufacturers responded by creating highly decorated, smaller, more delicate forms, often with hollow stems, known to collectors today as &quot;Excise glasses&quot;. In 1780, the government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation. English labour and capital then shifted to Dublin and Belfast, and new glassworks specialising in cut glass were installed in Cork and Waterford. In 1825, the tax was renewed, and gradually the industry declined until the mid-nineteenth century, when the tax was finally repealed.

From the 18th century, English lead glass became popular throughout Europe, and was ideally suited to the new taste for wheel-cut glass decoration perfected on the Continent owing to its relatively soft properties. In Holland, local engraving masters such as David Wolff and Frans Greenwood stippled imported English glassware, a style that remained popular through the eighteenth century. Such was its popularity in Holland that the first Continental production of lead-crystal glass began there, probably as the result of imported English workers. Imitating lead-crystal &quot;à la façon d’Angleterre&quot; presented technical difficulties, as the best results were obtained with covered pots in a coal-fired furnace, a particularly English process requiring specialised cone-furnaces. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, lead-crystal glass was being produced in France, Hungary, Germany, and Norway. By 1800, Irish lead crystal had overtaken lime-potash glasses on the Continent, and traditional glassmaking centres in Bohemia began to focus on colored glasses rather than compete directly against it.

The development of lead glass continued through the twentieth century, when in 1932 scientists at the Corning Glassworks, New York State, developed a new lead glass of high optical clarity. This became the focus of Steuben Glass Works, a division of Corning, which produced decorative vases, bowls, and glasses in Art Deco style. Lead-crystal continues to be used in industrial and decorative applications.

==Lead glazes==
The fluxing and refractive properties valued for lead glass also make it attractive as a pottery or ceramic glaze. Lead glazes first appear in first century BC to first century AD Roman wares, and occur nearly simultaneously in China. They were very high in lead, 45–60% PbO, with a very low alkali content, less than 2%. From the Roman period, they remained popular through the Byzantine and Islamic periods in the Near East, on pottery vessels and tiles throughout medieval Europe, and up to the present day. In China, similar glazes were used from the twelfth century for colored enamels on stoneware, and on porcelain from the fourteenth century.
These could be applied in three different ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body in the form of a lead compound in suspension, either from galena (PbS), red lead (Pb3O4), white lead (2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2), or lead oxide (PbO). The second method involves mixing the lead compound with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the lead compound with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it. The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.

Tin-opacified glazes appear in Iraq in the eighth century AD. Originally containing 1–2% PbO; by the eleventh century high-lead glazes had developed, typically containing 20–40% PbO and 5–12% alkali. These were used throughout Europe and the Near East, especially in Iznik ware, and continue to be used today. Glazes with even-higher lead content occur in Spanish and Italian maiolica, with up to 55% PbO and as low as 3% alkali. Adding lead to the melt allows the formation of tin oxide more readily than in an alkali glaze: tin oxide precipitates into crystals in the glaze as it cools, creating its opacity.

The use of lead glaze has several advantages over alkali glazes in addition to their greater optical refractivity. Lead compounds in suspension may be added directly to the ceramic body. Alkali glazes must first be mixed with silica and fritted prior to use, since they are soluble in water, requiring additional labor. A successful glaze must not &quot;crawl&quot;, or peel away from the pottery surface upon cooling, leaving areas of unglazed ceramic. Lead reduces this risk by reducing the surface tension of the glaze. It must not craze, forming a network of cracks, caused when the thermal contraction of the glaze and the ceramic body do not match properly. Ideally, the glaze contraction should be 5–15% less than the body contraction, as glazes are stronger under compression than under tension. A high-lead glaze has a linear expansion coefficient of between 5 and 7×10−6/°C, compared to 9 to 10×10−6/°C for alkali glazes. Those of earthenware ceramics vary between 3 and 5×10−6/°C for non-calcareous bodies and 5 to 7×10−6/°C for calcareous clays, or those containing 15–25% CaO. Therefore, the thermal contraction of lead glaze matches that of the ceramic more closely than an alkali glaze, rendering it less prone to crazing. A glaze should also have a low enough viscosity to prevent the formation of pinholes as trapped gasses escape during firing, typically between 900 and 1100 °C, but not so low as to run off. The relatively low viscosity of lead glaze mitigates this issue. It may also have been cheaper to produce than alkali glazes.
Lead glass and glazes have a long and complex history, and continue to play new roles in industry and technology today.

==Lead crystal==

Lead oxide added to the molten glass gives lead crystal a much higher index of refraction than normal glass, and consequently much greater &quot;sparkle&quot; by increasing specular reflection and the range of angles of total internal reflection. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of &quot;n&quot; = 1.5; the addition of lead produces an index of refraction of up to 1.7. This higher refractive index also raises the correlated dispersion, the degree to which the glass separates light into its colors, as in a prism. The increases in refractive index and dispersion significantly increase the amount of reflected light and thus the &quot;fire&quot; in the glass.

In cut glass, which has been hand- or machine-cut with facets, the presence of lead also makes the glass softer and easier to cut. Crystal can consist of up to 35% lead, at which point it has the most sparkle.

Makers of lead crystal objects include:

==Safety==
Several studies have demonstrated that serving food or drink in glassware containing lead oxide can cause lead to leach into the contents, even when the glassware has not been used for storage. Due to an inability to &quot;indicate a threshold for the key effects of lead,&quot; a 2011 World Health Organization committee on food additives &quot;concluded that it was not possible to establish a new PTWI (provisional tolerable weekly intake) that would be considered health protective.&quot;

The amount of lead released from lead glass increases with the acidity of the substance being served. Vinegar, for example, has been shown to cause more rapid leaching compared to white wine, as vinegar is more acidic. Citrus juices and other acidic drinks leach lead from crystal as effectively as alcoholic beverages. Daily usage of lead crystalware (without longer-term storage) was found to add up to 14.5 μg of lead from drinking a 350ml cola beverage.

The amount of lead released into a food or drink increases with the amount of time it stays in the vessel. In a study performed at North Carolina State University, the amount of lead migration was measured for port wine stored in lead crystal decanters. After two days, lead levels were 89 μg/L (micrograms per liter). After four months, lead levels were between 2,000 and 5,000 μg/L. White wine doubled its lead content within an hour of storage and tripled it within four hours. Some brandy stored in lead crystal for over five years had lead levels around 20,000 μg/L.

Lead leaching from the same decanter decreases with repeated uses. This finding is &quot;consistent with ceramic chemistry theory, which predicts that leaching of lead from crystal is self-limiting exponentially as a function of increasing distance from the crystal-liquid interface.&quot;

It has been proposed that the historic association of gout with the upper classes in Europe and America was, in part, caused by the extensive use of lead crystal decanters to store fortified wines and whisky. Statistical evidence linking gout to lead poisoning has been published.

<text>Jill Cornell Tarter (born January 16, 1944) is an American astronomer best known for her work on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Tarter is the former of the Center for SETI Research, holding the Bernard M. Oliver Chair for SETI at the SETI Institute.
In 2002, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine recognized her as one of the 50 most important women in science.

==Early life and education==
Tarter grew up in New York State, and graduated from Eastchester High School in 1961. She was elected to its alumni association hall of fame in 2001. Prior to his death when she was twelve years old, Tarter&#x27;s father was an early inspiration who encouraged her curiosity when she resisted suggestions that she follow pursuits considered more appropriate for a girl and announced that she wanted to be an engineer. On family trips to Florida with her father, she would look up at the dark skies and wonder who or what might be out there.

Tarter earned a Bachelor of Engineering Physics degree as an undergraduate at Cornell University (1965) as the only woman in her graduating class of 300 in the engineering college. Her professional interest in astronomy emerged as she pursued a Master&#x27;s degree (1971) and PhD (1975) at the University of California at Berkeley. In her PhD dissertation, she coined the term &quot;brown dwarf&quot; while researching small-mass objects that fail to stably fuse hydrogen.

==Astronomy career==

Tarter has worked on a number of major scientific projects, most relating to the search for extraterrestrial life. As a graduate student, she was inspired to do SETI research by the Cyclops Report. Stuart Bowyer gave her the report to read when Bowyer discovered that Tarter could program the then-outdated PDP-8/S computer that had been donated by Jack Welch for Bowyer&#x27;s SETI a project at Hat Creek Radio Observatory. She worked with Bowyer on the radio-search project SERENDIP and created the corresponding backronym, &quot;Search for Extraterrestrial Radio Emissions from Nearby Developed Intelligent Populations&quot;. She was project scientist for NASA&#x27;s High Resolution Microwave Survey (HRMS) in 1992 and 1993 and subsequently director of Project Phoenix (HRMS reconfigured) under the auspices of the SETI Institute. She was co-creator with Margaret Turnbull of the HabCat in 2002, a principal component of Project Phoenix. Tarter has published dozens of technical papers and lectures extensively both on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the need for proper science education. She had spent 35 years in the quest for extraterrestrial life when she announced her retirement in 2012.

On October 20, 2006, Tarter appeared on the Point of Inquiry podcast to discuss the question: &quot;Are we alone?&quot; Tarter stated, &quot;Humans will have a different view about being human if and when we know the answer to the &#x27;Are we alone?&#x27; question.&quot;

In 2011, Tarter delivered a talk, &quot;Intelligent Life in the Universe: Is Anybody Out There?&quot;, at the first Starmus Festival in the Canary Islands. The Festival, founded by astronomer Garik Israelian, was a blend of astronomy, allied sciences, music, and art. Tarter subsequently joined the Starmus Board of Directors, along with Israelian, astrophysicist and Queen founding guitarist Brian May, theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, and others. Her 2011 talk was published in the book &quot;Starmus: 50 Years of Man in Space&quot;. Tarter is a member of the CuriosityStream Advisory Board and the Space for Humanity Board of Advisors.

In May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 was introduced into Congress. Tarter was listed by one commentator as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass.

In 2017, science journalist Sarah Scoles published a biography of Tarter and a history of SETI, called &quot;Making Contact: Jill Tarter and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence.&quot;

==Honors and awards==
Tarter&#x27;s work in astrobiology and her success as a female scientist have garnered achievement awards from a number of scientific organizations.
* Awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award by Women in Aerospace in 1989.
* Elected a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry in 1994.
* Chabot Observatory named her their person of the year in 1997.
* Was awarded the Telluride Tech Festival Award of Technology in 2001. 
* Was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2002 and a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences in 2003.
* Received the Adler Planetarium Women in Space Science Award in 2003.
* Was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time Magazine&quot; in 2004.
* Received two public service medals from NASA.
* Asteroid 74824 Tarter (1999 TJ16) was named and approved by the International Astronomical Union’s Small Bodies Naming Committee in 2005.
* Received Wonderfest&#x27;s Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization in 2005.
* Recipient of a 2009 TED Prize.
* Elected a Legacy Fellow of the American Astronomical Society in 2020.
* Elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2021.

==Popular culture==
Tarter&#x27;s astronomical work is illustrated in Carl Sagan&#x27;s novel &quot;Contact&quot;. In the film version of &quot;Contact&quot;, the protagonist Ellie Arroway is played by Jodie Foster. Tarter conversed with the actress for months before and during filming, and Arroway was &quot;largely based&quot; on Tarter&#x27;s work. She has also been featured in John Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Symphony of Science&quot; music video, &quot;The Poetry of Reality (An Anthem for Science)&quot;.

Prior to Seticon II in 2012 Tarter addressed concerns about alien invasion, like those seen in science fiction films, in particular those expressed by Stephen Hawking. Correlated with Hawking&#x27;s reservations is his belief that humans should not attempt to broadcast signals in order to contact alien civilizations (Active SETI). Tarter thinks that aliens evolved enough to communicate with and travel to Earth will be long-lived enough to have needed to grow beyond violent tendencies.
: “Often the aliens of science fiction say more about us than they do about themselves... While Sir [sic] Stephen Hawking warned that alien life might try to conquer or colonize Earth, I respectfully disagree. If aliens were able to visit Earth that would mean they would have technological capabilities sophisticated enough not to need slaves, food, or other planets. If aliens were to come here it would be simply to explore. Considering the age of the Universe, we probably wouldn’t be their first extraterrestrial encounter, either. We should look at movies like ‘Men in Black III,’ ‘Prometheus’ and ‘Battleship’ as great entertainment and metaphors for our own fears, but we should not consider them harbingers of alien visitation.”

<doc id="617539" wikidata="Q6969435" url="?curid=617539" title="Nathan Wright (judge)">
<text>Sir Nathan Wright (1654–1721) was an English judge, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal under King William III and Queen Anne. He offended the House of Commons by his use of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; in 1704, and lost office in 1705.

==Life==
The eldest surviving son of Ezekiel Wright, rector of Thurcaston, Leicestershire and son of Robert Wright, and his wife Dorothy, second daughter of John Oneby of Hinckley in the same county, he was born on 10 February 1654. In 1668 he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, but left the university without a degree. In 1670 he was admitted at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 29 November 1677, and elected bencher in 1692.

On the death of his father in 1668 Wright inherited enough to enable him to marry early, and have a standing in his native county. The recordership of Leicester, to which he was elected in 1680, he lost on the surrender of the charter of the borough in 1684, but was reinstated in office on its restoration in 1688. In the same year he was elected deputy-recorder of Nottingham, and was junior counsel for the crown in the case of the seven bishops (29 June). On 11 April 1692 he was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law. On 16 December 1696 he made his reputation with his speech as counsel for the Crown in the proceedings against Sir John Fenwick in the House of Lords; and shortly before the commencement of Hilary term 1696–7 he was made king&#x27;s serjeant and knighted.

Wright opened the case against Edward Rich, 6th Earl of Warwick on his trial on 28 March 1699 for the murder of Richard Coote; he conducted on 12 October 1699 the prosecution of Mary Butler, alias Strickland, for forgery; and was one of the counsel for Henry Howard, 7th Duke of Norfolk in the proceedings on his divorce bill in March 1700. In the same year he was offered the great seal, as willing to succeed Lord Somers. He accepted, and was appointed lord keeper and sworn of the privy council on 21 May. He took his seat as speaker of the House of Lords on 20 June following, and the oaths and declaration on 10 February 1701.

Wright was one of the lords justices nominated on 27 June 1700, and again on 28 June 1701, to act as regents during the king&#x27;s absence from the realm. He was also an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the board of trade. Wright presided over the proceedings taken against Somers and other lords on whom it was sought to fix the responsibility for the negotiation of the Second Partition Treaty. He continued in office on the accession of Queen Anne; he pronounced on 31 July 1702 the decree dissolving the Savoy Hospital, and presided over the commission which on 22 October following met at the Cockpit to discuss the terms of the projected union with Scotland but accomplished nothing.

Without experience of chancery business, Wright worked from a manual of practice compiled for his use; but his care entailed an accumulation of arrears. He excluded Somers with other Whig magnates from the commission of the peace, and was attacked in the House of Commons (31 March 1704). He was, however, considered an honest judge; and his intervention, by the issue of writs of habeas corpus (8 March 1705), on behalf of the two counsel committed by the House of Commons to the custody of the serjeant-at-arms for pleading the cause of the plaintiffs in the Aylesbury election case, was brave (see Sir James Montagu). The House of Commons told the serjeant-at-arms to make no return to the writs, and might perhaps have proceeded to commit the lord keeper, but a prorogation terminated the affair.

The coalition of autumn 1705, between Marlborough and Godolphin and the whig junto, was sealed by the dismissal of Wright, now out of favour with both parties, and his replacement (11 October) by William Cowper. He became a county magnate. His principal seat was at Caldecote, Warwickshire, but he had also estates at Hartshill, Belgrave, and Brooksby in Leicestershire.

Wright died at Caldecote on 4 August 1721, and was buried in Caldecote church.

==Legacy==
A small but significant modification of criminal procedure, the substitution (by 1 Anne, stat. ii. c. 9, s. 3) of sworn for unsworn testimony on behalf of the prisoner in cases of treason and felony, appears to have been due to Wright&#x27;s initiative. His decrees in chancery are reported by Vernon and Peere Williams.

==Family==
In 1676, Nathan Wright married Elizabeth Ashby, second daughter of George Ashby of Quenby, Leicestershire, by whom he had six sons and four daughters.

*George Wright, the eldest son, purchased the manor of Gayhurst, Buckinghamshire, which remained in the family until the 19th century.
*Rev. Nathan Wright of Englefield House, the second son, who married Ann Paulet, only daughter of Lord Francis Paulet.
*Dorothy Wright, who married Henry Grey, 3rd Earl of Stamford and was the mother of Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford.

<doc id="617540" wikidata="Q826737" url="?curid=617540" title="Mitsubishi Galant">
<text>The is an automobile which was produced by Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi from 1969 until 2012. The model name was derived from the French word &quot;galant&quot;, meaning &quot;chivalrous&quot;. There have been nine distinct generations with total cumulative sales exceeding five million units. It began as a compact sedan, but over the course of its life evolved into a mid-size car. Initial production was based in Japan, with manufacturing later moved to other countries.

== First generation (A50; 1969) ==
The first generation of the car, initially known as the Colt Galant, was released in December 1969 at a new Mitsubishi Japanese dealership called &quot;Galant Shop&quot;. The design was dubbed &quot;Dynawedge&quot; by Mitsubishi, referring to the influence of aerodynamics on the silhouette. Three models were available, powered by the new &#x27;Saturn&#x27; engine in 1.3- (&quot;AI&quot; model) or 1.5-liter (&quot;AII&quot; and &quot;AIII&quot;) configurations. 1.4- and 1.6-liter versions (14L and 16L) replaced these in September 1971. A larger 1.7-liter arrived for the top GS model in January 1973. Initially only available as a four-door sedan, five-door estate and two-door hardtop (A53) variants were added in 1970. The hardtop was Mitsubishi&#x27;s first production passenger car with full side windows and no side pillars. In March 1973, with only two months of production left, the cleaner &quot;MCA-II&quot; version of the 1.6 arrived. With it was three horsepower down on the regular version.

The Galant was offered as a competitor to the Toyota Corona, Nissan Bluebird, Honda Accord, and Mazda Capella. It became Mitsubishi&#x27;s first car to be sold in the United States in 1971 when the Chrysler Corporation, the company&#x27;s new partner and stakeholder, began importing the car as the Dodge Colt, as their answer to new American subcompacts, the Ford Pinto, the Chevrolet Vega, and the AMC Gremlin. It was also produced by Chrysler Australia and sold alongside the larger Chrysler Valiant models as the Chrysler Valiant Galant. In South Africa, the A53 Colt Galant arrived in late 1972 as the Dodge Colt 1600 GS (AY series). The car had already been rallied there, in 1300 and 1600 forms, and only the Hardtop GS version was sold to capitalize on the car&#x27;s sporty image. Gross power claimed was at 6700 rpm and the car was fitted with Rostyle wheels as also used on locally assembled Hillman Vogues.

From 1970, a fastback coupé model was developed, the Galant GTO. Fashioned after contemporary American muscle cars, the hardtop GTO was available with a choice of two &quot;Saturn&quot; engines and the 2-litre &quot;Astron 80&quot;, and was available until 1975. The nameplate was sufficiently highly regarded in Japan for it to be resurrected for the 1990 Mitsubishi GTO coupé.

A third, more compact coupé was introduced on a chassis shortened by 12 cm in 1971, the Galant FTO. Powered by the 4G41 1.4 L engine, it too would leave a legacy for the company to return to in the 1990s with the Mitsubishi FTO.

=== New Zealand ===
Although the earlier Colt had been imported in limited numbers, this generation, in 1.6-litre coupé form only, was the first model to establish the Mitsubishi brand in New Zealand from 1971 when newly appointed distributor Todd Motors, which also imported and assembled Chrysler and Hillman, started selling a small number of Japanese-assembled cars to supplement its mainstream Hillman Avenger and Hunter models.

The coupé was assembled in New Zealand from 1972, firstly at Todd&#x27;s Petone factory, on the Avenger/Hunter line and, from 1974, at the brand-new purpose-built factory in Porirua (closed in 1998).

== Second generation (A112, A114, A115; 1973) ==
The second generation Mitsubishi Colt Galant A11* series was built from 1973 and received a replacement in 1976. Introduced on 24 May 1973 (on sale 1 June) in the Japanese domestic market, the second generation Galant was more widely exported as Mitsubishi&#x27;s ambitions grew. It was again sold by Chrysler in many different guises; as the Dodge Colt in the United States, as the Plymouth Colt and Plymouth Cricket in Canada (from 1974), as the Chrysler Valiant Galant and as the Chrysler Galant in Australia, and in Europe as the Colt Galant. Transmissions were now all floor mounted and include a four-speed manual and a five-speed unit for sportier models. A three-speed automatic transmission was also available. The smaller 1600 engine was also available in the cleaner &quot;MCA-II&quot; version right from 1973, a model which met Japan&#x27;s 1975 emissions standards. This version was marginally less powerful, with rather than the engine seen in the previous model.

This new Galant model was more curvaceous, influenced by contemporary &quot;coke bottle styling&quot;, and featured a range of larger &#x27;Astron&#x27; engines developing up to 125 PS in 2000 cc form to complement the &#x27;Saturn&#x27; units. During the second generation, the first Astron 80 engines were introduced in some markets using Mitsubishi&#x27;s newly developed &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; balance shaft technology for reduced vibration and noise. Body styles remained the same as the first generation Colt Galants offered in sedan, wagon, pillar-less two-door hardtop coupé with the addition of a fixed post coupé for some markets. New models were added to the line up, including GL-II, SL-5, GT and GS-II. The Estate (A112V, sold as a commercial vehicle in Japan) was only available with the 100 PS 1600 engine, in Custom, GL, or SL-5 (with a five-speed manual transmission). It had vestigial wood panelling, featuring a narrow strip on the tailgate only.

In New Zealand the hardtop, now with an 1855 cc engine was again assembled by Todd Motors at Porirua. The sedan was not offered as Todd was planning to assemble the larger Galant Sigma sedan and wagon range from late 1977 and they were still importing the British Avenger and Hunter models.

In South Africa, the Dodge Colt 1600 GS arrived in late 1975 (YB series) to replace the earlier AY. Aside from the new body, with wider wheels and improved handling, it also benefitted from a new five-speed gearbox. In August 1976, the name was changed to Chrysler Colt, and the new GS II received a 2.0-liter engine with . The 1600 also became available in less sporty GL trim, and a set of four-door models complemented the earlier hardtop. This new range signalled a move away from British and Australian sourced Chrysler products, with the four-door replacing the locally built Chrysler Vogue. Only three months later, Chrysler South Africa ceased operations. Mitsubishi production was continued by the new Sigma Motor Corporation.
== Third generation (A120/A130; 1976) ==

The third generation of the car was introduced in 1976, and was known as Galant Σ (Sigma). In many export markets the car was simply known as the Galant. At that time, the Dodge Colt in America was actually a Mitsubishi Lancer, not the Galant anymore, but nonetheless the Galant Wagon variant was sold with the Dodge Colt label in the US and Canada. In Australia, where the car was made locally at Chrysler&#x27;s Clovelly Park plant, it was marketed as the Chrysler Sigma and, after the 1980 buyout of Chrysler Australia by Mitsubishi, as the Mitsubishi Sigma. Australian content was quite high and included a locally-made 2.6-litre &#x27;Astron&#x27; four (introduced 1980) which, in December 1985, replaced the 1.6, 1.85 and two-litre engines used in other export markets.

The wagon version was introduced in 1977, a little while after the sedans. A new two-door coupé was introduced in 1976 to replace the Galant GTO. It was known in Japan as the Galant Λ (Lambda). The coupé was sold in the United States between 1978 and 1980 as the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Sapporo. In Australia the Lambda was marketed initially as the Chrysler Sigma Scorpion and latter as the Mitsubishi Scorpion.

Mitsubishi introduced the &quot;MCA-Jet&quot; engine for Japan and other emissions-controlled markets with its latest Galant. This incorporated the &quot;Jet Valve&quot;, a secondary intake valve which improved emissions without necessitating the need for a completely redesigned cylinder head. In 1978, Mitsubishi in Japan established a dedicated dealership sales channel called () to sell the Galant and other selected vehicles. After late 1977 the 1850 variant was discontinued, as Mitsubishi focussed their efforts on making the 1600 and the 2000 engines pass the new, stricter emissions standards.

In Japan, the Galant range received a new variant in March 1978, known as Galant Sigma Eterna. This model has single rectangular headlights and different taillights. This model also sold as facelift model for selected markets in Europe, New Zealand and South America. Seven months later the twin round headlights front design was replaced with one featuring twin square headlights and also new taillights. Models with engines which passed the new 1978 standards changed from the A120 to the A130 range. Mitsubishi had limited resources, and the large choice of engines for the Galant lineup was reduced to one 1.6 and one 2.0, with , at the beginning of the 1979 model year.

Todd Motors initially assembled 1.6 GL, 1.85 GLX and two-litre GLS sedan models for New Zealand, with the GLS getting a five-speed manual transmission as standard with three-speed auto optional. These were the first NZ-assembled Mitsubishis to have rear screen demisters as standard. Early cars had conventional rod-suspended headliners developed locally to meet local content rules but these were notorious for collapsing on to the passengers&#x27; heads and were quickly replaced by newly developed, glued-in moulded foam liners. The range was later revised to add the wagon and drop the 1.85-litre engine.

The third generation Galant was the recipient of the Car of the Year award in South Africa in 1977. In South Africa, where it was built by the Sigma Motor Corporation, it was sold as the Colt Galant. Originally sold with the 1.6- and the 2.0-liter engines, the automatic-only 2.6-liter engine arrived in the middle of 1979 and was developed locally. The 2.6 arrived elsewhere only later. Mid-1979 was also when the facelifted (square headlights) model appeared in South Africa, with new &quot;low-inertia&quot; engines. Power output for the 2.0-liter remained at , but period testers felt it more powerful than the previous version.

Claimed, DIN power outputs in the European market were considerably lower than the JIS Gross ratings used in Japan. The 2-litre engine had a claimed realistic in Europe, fewer than the 1.6 in Japan.
== Fourth generation (A160; 1980)==

Introduced in 1980, Mitsubishi&#x27;s fourth iteration of the Galant Σ (Sigma)/Eterna Σ (Sigma) debuted many new innovations for Mitsubishi. The car was sold as the Mitsubishi Galant in most export markets, although in both Australia and New Zealand it was known as the Mitsubishi Sigma. The fourth generation sedan and coupé were both slightly larger than the third generation cars. Additional emphasis was given to ergonomics, aerodynamics, and safety. Shoulder room, leg room, and head space were all increased, and the trunk was slightly enlarged for more luggage capacity. The interior was made quieter with additional carpeting and other acoustic dampening materials and a double-thickness front bulkhead. The wagon version was also changed, although from the firewall back the vehicle remained the same as the previous version.

Their new &#x27;Sirius&#x27; engine was offered in turbocharged form for performance enthusiasts in some markets, with for Japanese market cars and for those export markets unencumbered by strict emissions rules. A new electronic fuel injection system was introduced on some versions of the gasoline Astron engine. For economy, an &#x27;Astron&#x27; 4D55, the first turbo-diesel engine in a Japanese passenger car, was also offered. Unusually, the fourth Galant was never offered with a naturally aspirated diesel engine. The 2.3 Turbo D has , enough to be considered &quot;sporty&quot; at the time, and was first shown at the 1980 Paris Motor Show. The diesel had some initial reliability issues; a redesigned cylinder head which appeared in 1982 took care of the problems. This model proved very popular in some markets, such as the BeNeLux countries, where it helped establish Mitsubishi in general and the Galant in particular.

For the second generation in a row Mitsubishi could claim to be building an award-winning car, as this was chosen as Car of the Year in New Zealand in 1981. The cars sold there were again locally assembled with 1.6 and two-litre engines, and a choice of transmissions and trim. As elsewhere, the wagon versions carried over the old body style with a new nose and interior. Production of the wagon version continued in Australia until 1987 when it was replaced by the new Magna.

From 1982 to 1983, some of the Australian Sigmas, which had the carried-over 2.0 or 2.6-litre locally made inline-four engine, were exported to the United Kingdom with the Lonsdale badge, in en effort at circumventing the voluntary import quota restrictions adopted by Japanese manufacturers. However the car was unsuccessful, and for 1983 and 1984 it carried Mitsubishi Sigma badges in the UK before imports were finally discontinued.

The two door coupé was also redesigned for 1980 and was sold through 1983. While continuing with the Galant Λ/Eterna Λ label for the domestic Japanese market, the fourth generation was known as the Mitsubishi Scorpion in Australia, and the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Sapporo in the United States.
== Fifth generation (E11-E19; 1983) ==


A fifth-generation model shifted to front-wheel drive in August 1983 as a four-door sedan and four-door hardtop (with different styling). The design continued the direction started with the Tredia, albeit with more harmonious proportions. Drag resistance was down to an average 0.36 formula_1. All new chassis numbers, from E11A to E19A, marked the change. External dimensions all grew, but only marginally, while the wheelbase was longer. Thanks to the more compact drivetrain, however, passenger space increased noticeably and the boot grew from while the liftover edge was significantly lowered. Weight distribution was distinctly towards the front, with 64.47% of the car&#x27;s weight over the front wheels for the turbodiesel. In the Japanese market there was also a parallel &quot;Eterna&quot; lineup with very minor differences in appearance and equipment. This generation formed the basis of the widened (by 4 inches/100 mm) Mitsubishi Magna produced in Australia from 1985, the same year in which Mitsubishi won &quot;Bild am Sonntag&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Das Goldene Lenkrad&quot; (Golden Steering Wheel) award in Germany for the Galant and Wheels magazine&#x27;s &quot;Car of the Year&quot; for the Magna. Mitsubishi Motors codenamed these cars as &quot;YF&quot; and &quot;YFW&quot;—&quot;W&quot; for &quot;wide&quot;, respectively.

The station wagon version was effectively replaced by the Chariot/Space Wagon in most markets. The Galant was the third Japanese car to adopt four-wheel anti-lock brakes, using Bosch&#x27;s ABS system. Vehicles in Japan installed with the four-speed transmission were equipped with what Mitsubishi called Super Shift, essentially installing a transfer case, without adding another driveshaft to the rear wheels. Super Shift was no longer offered with the introduction of the five-speed manual transmission.

Exports began about a year after introduction. European and rest-of-the-world trim levels were often engine-specific, depending on the market: At the time of introduction, GL and GLX models were offered with either 1.6-litre or 1.8-litre engines, GLS models had 2.0-litre engines (badged 2000 GLS; in some markets there was also a 2000 GLX) and Diesel versions had a 1.8-litre Sirius turbo-diesel engine. The diesel model received GL or GLX trim, although in some markets it was simply the 1800 TD. A fuel injected 2000 Turbo was also available in some export markets. The TD and the Turbo both received standard power steering.

Equipment levels in Japan had more interesting names, ranging from the LS and LG via Super Saloon, Super Touring, Super Exceed, and GSR-X up to the most luxurious Royal. The top models for Japan (the &quot;Super Exceed&quot; sedan or &quot;VR&quot; hardtop) were powered by the (JIS gross, later only 170 PS were claimed) turbocharged and intercooled &quot;Sirius Dash 3/2 valve&quot; engine. This engine switched between using two and three valves per cylinder to combine high top-end power with low-end drivability as well being economical in operation.

Beginning in October 1986, the all-new 2-liter Cyclone V6 engine was installed in the Galant/Eterna, sedans as well as hardtops, shared with the all-new executive limousine Debonair. Some of the V6 variants received electrically retractable door mirrors and electronically controlled power steering.

Sales in the United States began with the 1985 model year, joining the new Mitsubishi dealership network that started operations in 1981. This was the first time the Galant series was sold stateside since the station wagon was marketed as a Dodge Colt a few years earlier. The mid-model refresh was offered for 1987, adding redesigned seats and the availability of a five-speed manual transmission and leather upholstery, and remained until 1990, sold alongside the sixth generation Galant. 

The widened Australian-made version, however, remained in production until 1991 when it was replaced by a new generation Magna, whereas the Japanese hardtop range was produced until it was replaced by the new Sigma/Diamante version in 1990. In addition, the taxi-spec sedan remained in production for Japanese commercial use until December 1999, when Mitsubishi abandoned that market. The taxi was only available with an LPG-powered 1.8-litre engine, originally the 4G37. From October 1986 the Taxi (and driving school model) was fitted with Mitsubishi&#x27;s new &quot;Cyclone&quot; combustion chamber design.

At the end of October 1990, the Galant Σ Taxi received a light update and a reshuffle of the models. There was a base L model and a better equipped LG with body-colored bumpers. The modification included three-point belts in the rear seat, a high-mounted brake light, adjusted gearing, a flattened rear seat squab, larger radiator, and a larger washer fluid tank, amongst other detail improvements. A five-speed manual, or three- or four-speed automatics were on offer. Target production was around 1,200 units per year. For its last three years of production, this model received an LPG-version of the 1834 cc &quot;4G93&quot; engine.

;New Zealand – Sigma and V3000
The fifth-generation Galant was introduced to the New Zealand market in mid-1984, as the Mitsubishi Sigma. Assembled by Mitsubishi&#x27;s New Zealand distributors, Todd Motors, the Sigma was available with the choice of 1.8- and 2.0-litre engines, the 2.0 having the option of automatic transmission, and availability with a turbocharger on certain models.

Several trim levels were offered, GL, GLX, GSR, Super Saloon and SE. The top SE versions notably featured &#x27;Sigma&#x27; branded alloy wheels, digital instrumentation, climate controlled air conditioning, cruise control, speed-dependent intermittent wipers and a salmon-brown coloured interior treatment, the treatment changing deep red colour as a running change in 1985 on this model.

Further running changes concerned the rear styling. For the initial 1984 production run the rear numberplate was located above the bumper, however for 1985 and 1986 the plate was relocated to below the bumper, in the manner of the Japanese domestic market Galant models. New taillights were fitted for 1987, the rear numberplate reverting to its original place above the bumper.

1987 was a key year for Mitsubishi in New Zealand, when it bought out Todd Motors&#x27; automotive operations.

Although the sixth generation Galant was introduced for 1988, the older fifth generation bodyshell stayed in production alongside it. Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand intentionally decided to retain the fifth generation sedan bodystyle for a new, unique to New Zealand, flagship model—the 3.0-liter V6 engined Mitsubishi V3000. The V3000 was developed specifically to give Mitsubishi New Zealand a six-cylinder family car, suitable for towing boats and caravans, to compete with the imported Ford Falcon (EA) and Holden Commodore (VN) models.

While the rear styling of the previous Sigma model was retained, the frontal treatment was changed to now feature a more formal, upright chrome grille (the bonnet and grille were from the top-of the-line Sigma SE), and uprated suspension. The V3000 was available in basic Executive, mid-range Super Saloon, and top-of-the-range SEi trim levels, the latter with luxury trim and digital dashboard. Later a sports version Elante was introduced, based on the Executive. The V6 engine combined with relatively low weight and gearing ensured excellent performance, New Zealand&#x27;s traffic patrol selected them as patrol cars to replace the turbocharged Sigma GSR. These police cars had the Elante suspension pack, which was an option on other models. For 1990, the V3000 was further updated and now featured the front styling of the Eterna hardtop. New Zealand was the only market where this restyling was applied to the fifth generation four-door sedan bodyshell. Assembly of this model continued until 1991, when it was replaced by the second-generation Australian Mitsubishi Magna TR V6 range, which continued to be known as V3000 for the New Zealand market.

=== Hardtop sedan ===

The hardtop sedan bodywork was used in export markets as well, where it received a six-window design unlike for its Japanese market counterparts. It was marketed under different names; &quot;Galant Σ&quot; or &quot;Eterna Σ&quot; (Sigma) in Japan, &quot;Sapporo&quot; in Europe, and in the US as &quot;Galant Σ&quot; (1988 model year) followed by plain &quot;Sigma&quot; (1989 to 1990 model years). The &quot;Galant Σ&quot; was released for the 1988 model year, but the &quot;Sigma&quot; version with updated alloy wheels began US sales in August 1988 for the 1989 model year and continued until 1990. These cars were available with a 3.0-liter V6 (North America, only with automatic transmission) or 2.4-liter four-cylinder engines (Europe) in the export. In the domestic Japanese market the hardtops received 2.0-litre fours, or the smaller 2.0-litre &quot;6G71&quot; V6 engine from 1986, shared with the Mitsubishi Debonair limousine. For the top-of-the-line VR models, an intercooled turbo-charged &quot;4G63T&quot; &quot;Sirius Dash 3x2&quot; engine that automatically switched between two and three valves per cylinder depending upon throttle response and therefore allowing both economy and performance, was fitted, along with self-levelling suspension, climate-controlled air-conditioning, blue velour interior, steering wheel-controlled audio functions, and 15-inch alloy wheels. From 1985, the powerplant was renamed &quot;Cyclone Dash 3x2&quot;.

The hardtop range continued to be available until 1990 as Mitsubishi&#x27;s most luxurious offering in most export markets, until the Sigma/Diamante replaced it. It also continued on sale in Japan, but only as the Eterna Sigma after a facelift in May 1989. In Japan the hardtop was available with a 1.8-liter four at the bottom of the range and with the large 3.0-liter V6 in the top &quot;Duke&quot; version after this makeover. The European market Sapporo took its bow at the 1987 Frankfurt Motor Show; the large 2.4-liter &quot;4G64&quot; &quot;Sirius&quot; four-cylinder producing at 5,000 rpm ( for the catalyzed version).
== Sixth generation (E31, E32, E33, E34, E35, E38, E39; 1987) ==
In October 1987 the same platform was used for a sixth-generation model which adopted taller, rounded styling. This generation won the Car of the Year Japan award in 1987 and the GS model became &quot;Motor Trend&quot;&#x27;s Import Car of the Year in 1989. This Galant began American sales in 1989, side by side with the previous generation Sigma.

Mitsubishi developed Dynamic ECS adaptive air suspension, the world&#x27;s first production semi-active electronically controlled suspension system in passenger cars; the system was first incorporated in the 1987 Galant model.

The Galant range underwent a minor facelift in 1991, with new grilles and other modifications. Also in 1991, Mitsubishi Motors Company completed a new assembly facility at Barcelona, Venezuela, with the Galant being one of the first models produced. It was sold there until 1994 under the ZX, MF, MS and MX names, which identified the various levels of equipment and transmission.

The Sigma designation disappeared with the 1990 model. A new hardtop liftback model was added in 1988, called the (). and in Japan, the Eterna was only sold at a specific retail chain called &quot;Car Plaza&quot;. This generation Galant was also sold in Canada as the Dodge 2000 GTX and Eagle 2000 GTX. The five-door liftback version was never offered in North America, where buyers prefer traditional sedans. In most of the world, the sixth generation Galant was replaced towards the end of 1992, but North American sales only ended in 1994, when the next generation Galant arrived there.

A limited edition based on the GTi-16v model was introduced in 1989, modified by German tuning company AMG (owned by Mercedes-Benz since 1999), with mildly uprated engine () and unique body kit, alloy wheels, and full leather interior. The AMG appearance treatment was also achieved on the Debonair for 1986. It, along with the Debonair, were the only Japanese cars that received the AMG treatment.

The sixth generation was also the first to see the introduction of the &quot;VR-4&quot; variant, which was the basis for Mitsubishi&#x27;s participation in the 1988–1992 World Rally Championships. The Galant&#x27;s &quot;4G63&quot; two-litre DOHC turbocharged engine and 4WD transmission was later adopted for the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution with little modification and would remain in production for fifteen years. Starting in 1989, the Mitsubishi Galant V-series were produced for the Japanese market as a sporty alternative to the regular Galant range. The lineup consisted of Viento and VX-S/VZ-S models featuring the higher output 1.8 and 2.0 Turbo DOHC engines with both automatic and manual transmissions available. The V-series featured the VR-4 interior, exterior design and updated bumpers (without side skirts), clear indicator lens covers, optional two-tone body paint, as well as standard air conditioning, full electrics, rear windscreen wiper, spoiler and alloy wheels. Fans sometimes call this car the &quot;Evo Zero&quot; but this was never more than a nickname as the Evolution series is Lancer-based.

== Seventh generation (E52, E53, E54, E55, E57, E64, E72, E74, E77, E84, E88; 1992) ==
A new Galant debuted in September 1992 at the Tokyo Motor Show (model year 1994 in the US), originally only available as a four-door sedan (which was the only model to be sold in the US). A five-door liftback derivative made its world premiere at the February 1993 Dutch Motor Show. A Japan-only hardtop derivative called the () (French for emerald) was also launched in 1992. The width dimensions of the model sold in Japan no longer complied with Japanese government dimension regulations.

In October 1993, Mitsubishi introduced a trim level for this model called &quot;VX-R&quot;, offered a 2.0 L MIVEC version of the &quot;6A12&quot;, a high revving naturally aspirated V6 engine with more aggressive tuning. This engine is also found on Mitsubishi&#x27;s midsize sports car FTO&#x27;s GP trim levels which introduced in 1994. Output was placed at 200 hp (149 kW) and 147 lb⋅ft (199 N⋅m) of torque.

This generation marked a substantial change in suspension design. The front switched from struts to a multi-link structure featuring two lower arms and one upper arm. The rear switched from a beam axle to a newly designed multi-link system. This was the world&#x27;s first 4-wheel multi-link suspension in an FF car. Both designs would carry over to the second generation Mitsubishi Eclipse and its sister vehicles.

=== VR-4 ===

For 1992, the emergence of the homologated Lancer Evolution meant that the top-spec Galant VR-4 was no longer constrained by sporting regulations. The new generation thus became a less overtly competition oriented vehicle. The existing, proven 4WD transmission was carried over, in keeping with Mitsubishi&#x27;s reputation for performance-enhancing technology, but the old inline-four was superseded by a smoother twin-turbo 2.0-litre V6, and mated either to a conventional five-speed manual, or a four-speed &quot;INVECS&quot; auto complete with &quot;fuzzy logic&quot;, which allowed the transmission to adapt to the driver&#x27;s style and road conditions &quot;on the fly&quot;. It was capable of accelerating from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in about 6.5 seconds, and if derestricted could reach about .

Variants of the VR-4 using the same engine and drivetrain were sold in Japan as the Eterna XX-4 (1992) and Galant Sports GT liftback.

=== Export ===
Production in the United States began on 24 May 1993 when the first seventh generation Galant rolled off the assembly line in Normal, Illinois. In 1995, a slightly upgraded GS version was available with a twin cam engine, speed-sensitive steering, rear stabilizer bar, and an available manual transmission.

In Europe were also available naturally aspirated 2.5 L 24-valve DOHC engine, which was mounted with four-wheel drive, 5-speed manual transmission and four-wheel-steering. Body styles were four-door sedan and five-door Liftback. Rear differential was not available with limited-slip. In option were sunroof, A/C, cruise control, power windows, central locking, electrical heated seats and electrical side-mirrors.

In the Philippines, the seventh generation Galant started production in late October 1993. It was offered in 2 grades: VR and top-spec Super Saloon. There were 2 engine choices offered: the 2.0L V6 engine mated to a 5-speed manual for the VR or a 2.0L inline-four engine mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission for the Super Saloon grade.

== Eighth generation (EA1, EA2, EA3, EA4, EA5, EA7, EA8, EC1, EC4, EC5, EC7; 1996) ==
The eighth-generation 1996 model continued the 1992&#x27;s design themes but a five-door station wagon (known in Japan as the Legnum, derives from the Latin word regnum, meaning regal power or rank) was added while the five-door liftback was dropped. This model won the 1996–97 Car of the Year Japan award for the second time. Despite being superseded in the US and Europe from 2003, it remained on sale in other countries until 2006. In Japan, the Legnum was sold only at a specific retail chain called &quot;Car Plaza&quot;, while the Galant remained exclusive to Galant Shop locations. The Japanese market model was the first mass-produced car to use a gasoline direct injection engine, when a GDI version of the &quot;4G93&quot; inline-four engine was introduced.

This model was also produced in Barcelona, Venezuela, at the only Mitsubishi plant in Latin America. At the beginning, the Galant was marketed in that country under the &quot;MX&quot; and &quot;MF&quot; names in 1997 and 1998 (featuring a manual or &quot;INVECS-II&quot; automatic transmission respectively), then kept the Galant name until the end of its production in 2006. Although the equipment options were limited, the VR-4 appearance package was offered in that market.

The American market Galant, introduced on 7 July 1998, graduated to the US Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s mid-size class. The front suspension design switched from multi-link to struts, though the rear was upgraded with a stabilizer bar standard on all but the base DE model. The ES, LS and GTZ models were offered with a V6 engine, the &quot;6G72&quot; 3.0 L, mated to a standard four-speed conventional automatic. Another difference between Asian and European models was the lack of ABS, which was only installed on 3.0 L models. It received a facelift for the 2002 model year. 

In August 1998, Mitsubishi introduced the Aspire as the successor of Eterna. Externally identical to the facelifted Galant at the same time of introduction.

Mitsubishi opted to further develop the technology in its range-topping VR-4, which was now powered by an enlarged 2.5 L V6 twin-turbo. The car features either a conventional five-speed manual or INVECS-II transmission. Some variants (all of the pre-facelift model and Type-S for the facelift model) were also fitted with the same advanced active yaw control (AYC) as the Lancer Evolution, to give it greater agility than would be expected of such a large vehicle. Finally, as with the rest of the range, the VR-4 could now be had either as a Galant sedan or as a Legnum station wagon.

The MIVEC version of the &quot;6A12&quot; was drop down from the Japanese market model, but some Asian markets were offer this engine with the trim levels called &quot;VX-R&quot; or &quot;VR-M&quot;. The larger 2.5 L &quot;6A13&quot; was more common in the rest of the world.

== Ninth generation (2004) ==
=== North America ===

The United States has had the sedan-only ninth-generation PS platform model since October 15, 2003. It was announced at the 2003 New York International Auto Show in April for the 2004 model year, following the exhibition of the SSS concept sedan at the North American International Auto Show three years before. The ninth-generation United States-sourced model is available for sale only in a few regional markets, namely the United States, Puerto Rico, Russia, Ukraine and Arabia. Russia began sourcing its Galants from the United States from 2006. The Arabian markets began sourcing their Galants from the United States from the 2007 model year. The Galant had also been available in Canada and Mexico until the 2010 and 2009 model years, respectively.

A size increase resulted in slightly more interior space and a weight gain of several hundred pounds. The four-cylinder engine, while still 2.4 liters in displacement, upgraded from Mitsubishi&#x27;s 4G64 design to the newer 4G69 design, resulting in a horsepower increase from to and . Likewise, the V6 jumped from a 3.0-liter with to a 3.8-liter with and . All North American Galants gained all-wheel disc brakes but lost their rear stabilizer bar.

A Ralliart version joined for 2007, finally upgrading the V6 to a class-competitive and while also adding a firmer suspension, front strut tower bar, rear stabilizer bar, and eighteen-inch alloy wheels. Furthermore, the Ralliart trim was the first Galant to receive Mitsubishi&#x27;s updated infotainment system (MMCS) featuring a 7-inch touchscreen display with GPS navigation. The Ralliart was further distinguished from other Galant trims by a unique front aero bumper, sport mesh grille, projector-style ellipsoid headlamps, two-tone bumpers and color-keyed side air dams. For 2008, the trimming of models left the Ralliart as the only V6 model, and the Galant skips the 2008 model year in Canada, only to return in 2009 with the facelifted model.

Four-cylinder Galant models sold in California, Maine, Massachusetts, New York and Vermont are certified as Partial Zero-Emissions Vehicles (PZEV), with the engine rated .

This iteration of the Mitsubishi Galant only went on sale in the Middle East region for the 2007 model year, with a 2.4-liter engine and a 3.8-liter engine, imported from the United States.

Osamu Masuko, the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors, indicated that the ninth generation of the Galant would be the last to be manufactured in North America, to be replaced on the MMNA production line in Illinois by smaller vehicles which are more likely to appeal to export markets.

The final Mitsubishi Galant rolled off the assembly line in the United States on August 30, 2012. The Mitsubishi Concept-ZT that was unveiled in 2007 was initially expected to become the tenth generation Galant but this never materialized.

==== Facelifts ====
2006
The Galant receives some cosmetic changes, such as an AC adapter, a standard MP3 jack and upgrades to the interior.

2007
In 2007, the Galant was restyled - the interior and exterior were refreshed and an updated infotainment system was introduced.

2009
In 2009, the Galant was restyled for a third time during this generation. The 2009 Galant launched in February 2008.

A four-cylinder Sport Edition was added for the 2009 model year. Galant Sport models include new standard factory value packages as standard. Sportronic automatic transmission is standard in all models, with a four-speed for four-cylinder engines and a five-speed for V6 engines.

=== East Asia ===
Mitsubishi also assembles and markets a Taiwan made version of the ninth-generation Galant. In Taiwan, this version is known as the Mitsubishi Grunder. Taiwan was one of the first regions outside the Americas to market the ninth generation vehicle, when the Galant Grunder was launched in December 2004 with a unique front end. It has a version of the 2.4-liter engine and four-speed automatic (INVECS-II), and comes in either SEi format or as the better equipped EXi model.

This facelifted model is also sold in the Philippines from 2006 to 2009 as the Galant 240M, using Mitsubishi&#x27;s 2.4L 4G69 MIVEC engine with Mitsubishi&#x27;s 4-speed INVECS-II automatic transmission with Sportronic. It came with leather seats, remote keyless entry, eight-way power adjustment seat with variable lumbar support (driver side only), automatic climate control system, and an MP3-ready audio system. It only came in two color options; &quot;Merlin Black&quot; or &quot;Excalibur Silver&quot;. In 2009, Mitsubishi Philippines replaced this with the all-new &quot;SE&quot; trim. It featured a redesigned grill, a new 12-speaker audio system with Dolby 5.1 Surround and DTS support, GPS-based navigation system, power adjustable mirrors, reverse camera among other features.

The Taiwanese-made Galant has also been sold by Soueast Motor in the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the Galant since 2006. Models in China receive a 2.0-liter or 2.4-liter petrol engines, each paired with an automatic transmission.

=== Australia ===
From 2005 to 2008, a localized version called the Mitsubishi 380 was manufactured in Australia for the Australian and New Zealand markets. No four cylinder engines were offered, the 380 being available only with the 3.8-liter 6G75 V6 with . This replaced the long-lived Magna line, and it was the last Mitsubishi car produced in Australia.

20 limited edition TMR models (Team Mitsubishi Ralliart) were made towards the end of the car&#x27;s production at the Tonsley Park factory in Adelaide, running a supercharged version of the 3.8 6G75 with 230kW and 442Nm.
== Nameplate use with Lancer ==


With the exception of the Lancer Evolution X, the ninth generation Lancer was marketed as the Galant Fortis (Latin for strong, brave and resolute) in the Japanese domestic market. It comes in three trim levels: Exceed, Super Exceed, and Ralliart.

Between August 2015 to August 2017, GHK Motors (Mitsubishi Brunei) offered a version of the Lancer Sportback hatchback model under the name &quot;Galant&quot; in Brunei. The production of this model ceased at the end of August 2017 due to poor sales. Instead of increasing Mitsubishi&#x27;s popularity, it took sales away from the Lancer.

<text>Athanasios Papoulis (; 1921 – April 25, 2002) was a Greek-American engineer and applied mathematician.

==Life==
Papoulis was born in modern day Turkey in 1921, and his family was moved to Athens, Greece in 1922 as a consequence of the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. He earned his undergraduate degree from National Technical University of Athens. In 1945, he stowed away on a boat to escape the impending Greek Civil War and settled in the United States. He studied under the supervision of John Robert Kline at the University of Pennsylvania and earned his Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1950. His dissertation was titled &quot;On the Strong Differentiation of the Indefinite Integral.&quot;

He married Caryl Engwall in New York, New York in 1953, and had five children: Irene, Helen, James, Ann, and Mary. In 1952, after teaching briefly at Union College, he became a faculty member at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now Polytechnic Institute of New York University), where he earned the distinction of University Professor.

===Studies===
Papoulis contributed in the areas of signal processing, communications, and signal and system theory. His classic book &quot;Probability, Random Variables, and Stochastic Processes&quot; is used as a textbook in many graduate-level probability courses in electrical engineering departments all over the world.
By staying away from complete mathematical rigor while emphasizing the physical and engineering interpretations of probability, Papoulis&#x27;s book gained wide popularity.

===Theory===
Athanasios Papoulis specialized in engineering mathematics, his work covers probability, statistics, and estimation in the application of these fields to modern engineering problems. Papoulis also taught and developed subjects such as stochastic simulation, mean square estimation, likelihood tests, maximum entropy methods, Monte Carlo method, spectral representations and estimation, sampling theory, bispectrum and system identification, cyclostationary processes, deterministic signals in noise (part of deterministic systems and dynamical system studies), wave optics and the Wiener and Kalman filters.

====Contributions====
* Papoulis&#x27;s generalization of the sampling theorem unified many variations of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem into one theorem.
* The Papoulis–Gerchberg algorithm is an iterative signal restoration algorithm that has found widespread use in signal and image processing.
* &quot;Papoulis&#x27;s eloquent proof&quot; of the conventional sampling theorem requires only two equations.

<text>Lamellar ichthyosis, also known as ichthyosis lamellaris and nonbullous congenital ichthyosis, is a rare inherited skin disorder, affecting around 1 in 600,000 people.

==Presentation==
Affected babies are born in a collodion membrane – a shiny, waxy-appearing outer layer on the skin. This is shed 10–14 days after birth, revealing the main symptom of the disease: extensive scaling of the skin caused by hyperkeratosis.
With increasing age, the scaling tends to become concentrated around joints in areas such as the groin, the armpits, the inside of the elbow, and the neck. The scales often tile the skin and may resemble fish scales.

=== Collodion baby ===

In medicine, the term collodion baby applies to newborns who appear to have an extra layer of skin (known as a &quot;collodion membrane&quot;) that has a collodion-like quality. It is a descriptive term, not a specific diagnosis or disorder; as such, it is a syndrome.

==== Appearance and treatment at birth ====
The appearance is often described as a shiny film that resembles a layer of Vaseline. The eyelids and mouth may have the appearance of being forced open due to the tightness of the skin. There can also be associated eversion of the eyelids (ectropion).

Collodion babies can have severe medical consequences, mainly because the baby can lose heat and fluid through the abnormal skin. This can lead to hypothermia and dehydration. Strategies to prevent these problems include the use of emollients or nursing the baby in a humidified . There is an increased risk of skin infection and mechanical compression, leading to problems like limb ischemia. There is also a risk of intoxication by cutaneous absorption of topical products; for example, salicylate intoxication (similar to aspirin overdose) due to keratolytics.

The condition is not thought to be painful or in itself distressing to the child. Nursing usually takes place in a neonatal intensive care unit, and good intensive care seems to have improved the prognosis markedly. The collodion membrane should peel off or &quot;shed&quot; 2 to 4 weeks after birth, revealing the underlying skin disorder.

The condition can resemble but is different from harlequin type ichthyosis.

==== Long term course ====

The appearance can be caused by several skin diseases, and it is most often not associated with other birth defects. In most cases, the baby develops an ichthyosis or ichthyosis-like condition or other rare skin disorder.

Most cases (approximately 75%) of collodion baby will go on to develop a type of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (either lamellar ichthyosis or congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma).

In around 10% of cases the baby sheds this layer of skin and has normal skin for the rest of its life. This is known as &quot;self-healing collodion baby&quot;.

The remaining 15% of cases are caused by a variety of diseases involving keratinization disorders. Known causes of collodion baby include ichthyosis vulgaris and trichothiodystrophy. Less well documented causes include Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, Netherton syndrome, Gaucher disease type 2, congenital hypothyroidism, Conradi syndrome, Dorfman-Chanarin syndrome, ketoadipiaciduria, koraxitrachitic syndrome, ichthyosis variegata and palmoplantar keratoderma with anogenital leukokeratosis. Since many of these conditions have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, they are rare and can be associated with consanguinity.

Tests that can be used to find the cause of collodion baby include examination of the hairs, blood tests and a skin biopsy.

=== Associated medical problems ===
Overheating: The scaling of the skin prevents normal sweating so hot weather and/or vigorous exercise can cause problems.

Eye problems: The eyelids can be pulled down by the tightness of the skin and this can make eyelids (but usually just the lower one) very red and they are prone to drying and irritation.

Constriction bands: Very rarely children with this condition can have tight bands of skin around their fingers or toes (usually at the tips) that can prevent proper blood circulation to the area.

Hair loss: Severe scaling of the skin on the scalp can lead to patchy loss of hair, but this is rarely permanent.

==Genetics==

This condition is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and both parents must carry one copy of the defective gene in order to have a child born with the disorder. Carriers of a recessive gene usually do not show any signs or symptoms of the disorder.

One form of ichthyosis lamellaris (LI1) is associated with a deficiency of the enzyme keratinocyte transglutaminase.

Genes involved include:

==Diagnosis==
== Treatments ==
As with all types of ichthyosis, there is no cure but the symptoms can be relieved.
* Moisturizers
* Prevention of overheating
* Eye drops (to prevent the eyes from becoming dried out)
* Systemic Retinoids (isotretinoin and acitretin are very effective, but careful monitoring for toxicity is required. Only severe cases may require intermittent therapy.)

Psychological therapy or support may be required as well.

<text>A shell account is a user account on a remote server, typically running under Unix or Linux operating systems. The account gives access to a text-based command-line interface in a shell, via a terminal emulator. The user typically communicates with the server via the SSH protocol. In the early days of the Internet, one would connect using a modem.

Shell accounts were first made accessible in the 1980s to interested members of the public by Internet Service Providers—such as Netcom, Panix, The World, Digex—although in rare instances individuals had access to shell accounts through their employer or university. They were used for file storage, web space, email accounts, newsgroup access and software development. Before the late 1990s, shell accounts were often much less expensive than full net access through SLIP or PPP, which was required to access the then-new World Wide Web. Most personal computer operating systems also lacked TCP/IP stacks by default before the mid-1990s. Products such as The Internet Adapter were devised that could work as a proxy server, allowing users to run a web browser for the price of a shell account.

While direct internet connections made shell accounts largely obsolete for most users, they remained popular with some technically inclined subscribers.

Shell providers are often found to offer shell accounts at low-cost or free. These shell accounts generally provide users with access to various software and services including compilers, IRC clients, background processes, FTP, text editors (such as nano) and email clients (such as pine). Some shell providers may also allow tunneling of traffic to bypass corporate firewalls.

<doc id="617550" wikidata="Q276480" url="?curid=617550" title="Ambroise Paré">
<text>Ambroise Paré (; – 20 December 1590) was a French barber surgeon who served in that role for kings Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX and Henry III. He is considered one of the fathers of surgery and modern forensic pathology and a pioneer in surgical techniques and battlefield medicine, especially in the treatment of wounds. He was also an anatomist, invented several surgical instruments, and was a member of the Parisian barber surgeon guild.

In his personal notes about the care he delivered to Captain Rat, in the Piémont campaign (1537–1538), Paré wrote: &quot;Je le pansai, Dieu le guérit&quot; (&quot;I bandaged him and God healed him&quot;). This epitomises a philosophy that he used throughout his career. These words, inscribed on his statue in Laval, are reminiscent of the Latin adage &quot;medicus curat, natura sanat&quot;, &quot;The physician cures, nature heals&quot;.

==Early life==
Paré was born in 1510 in Bourg-Hersent, later incorporated into Laval, then part of the province of Maine, in northwestern France. As a child he watched, and was first apprenticed to, his older brother, a barber-surgeon in Paris. He was also a pupil at Hôtel-Dieu, France&#x27;s oldest hospital.

==Medicine==
Paré was a keen observer and did not allow the beliefs of the day to supersede the evidence at hand. In his autobiographical book, &quot;Journeys in Diverse Places&quot;, Paré inadvertently practised the scientific method when he returned the following morning to a battlefield. He compared one group of patients who were treated in the traditional manner with boiling elder oil and cauterization, and the remainder with a recipe made of egg yolk, oil of roses and turpentine, and left overnight. Paré discovered that the soldiers treated with the boiling oil were in agony, whereas the ones treated with the ointment had recovered because of the antiseptic properties of turpentine. This proved this method&#x27;s efficacy, and he avoided cauterization thereafter. However, treatments such as this were not widely used until many years later. He published his first book &quot;The method of curing wounds caused by arquebus and firearms&quot; in 1545.

Paré also reintroduced the ligature of arteries (first used by Galen and later described by Al-Zahrawi) instead of cauterization during amputation. The usual method of sealing wounds by searing with a red-hot iron often failed to arrest the bleeding and caused patients to die of shock. For the ligature technique he designed the &quot;Bec de Corbeau&quot; (&quot;crow&#x27;s beak&quot;), a predecessor to modern haemostats. Although ligatures often spread infection, it was still an important breakthrough in surgical practice. Paré detailed the technique of using ligatures to prevent hemorrhaging during amputation in his 1564 book &quot;Treatise on Surgery&quot;. During his work with injured soldiers, Paré documented the pain experienced by amputees which they perceive as sensation in the &#x27;phantom&#x27; amputated limb. Paré believed that phantom pains occur in the brain (the consensus of the medical community today) and not in remnants of the limb. He also performed many neurosurgical procedures.

In 1542, during the siege of Perpignan, Paré, accompanying the French army, employed a novel technique to aid in bullet extraction. During a battle, Maréchal de Brissac was wounded, having been shot in the shoulder. When finding the bullet seemed impossible, Paré had the idea to ask the victim to put himself in the exact position he was in when shot. The bullet was then found and removed by Henry&#x27;s personal surgeon, Nicole Lavernault.

Paré was also an important figure in the progress of obstetrics in the middle of the 16th century. He revived the practice of podalic version, and showed how even in cases of head presentation, surgeons with this operation could often deliver the infant safely, instead of having to dismember the infant and extract the infant piece by piece. During his time at the Hôtel-Dieu, Paré directly influenced the education of future royal midwife Louise Boursier.

Paré also introduced the lancing of infants&#x27; gums using a lancet during teething, in the belief that teeth were failing to emerge from the gums due to lack of a pathway, and that this failure was a cause of death. This belief and practice persisted for centuries, with some exceptions, until towards the end of the nineteenth century lancing became increasingly controversial and was then abandoned. 

Paré was ably seconded by his pupil Jacques Guillemeau, who translated his work into Latin, and at a later period himself wrote a treatise on midwifery. An English translation of it was published in 1612 with the title &quot;Childbirth; or, The Happy Delivery of Women&quot;.

In 1552, Paré was accepted into royal service of the Valois Dynasty under Henry II; he was however unable to cure the king&#x27;s fatal blow to the head, which he received during a tournament in 1559. Paré stayed in the service of the kings of France to the end of his life in 1590, ultimately serving Henry II, Francis II, Charles IX, and Henry III.

According to Henri IV&#x27;s chief minister Sully, Paré was a Huguenot and on 24 August 1572, the day of the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre, Paré&#x27;s life was saved when King Charles IX locked him in a clothes closet. He died in Paris on 20 December 1590 from natural causes in his 80th year, and is buried at the church of Saint André-des-Arts. While there is evidence that Paré was sympathetic to the Huguenot cause, he seems to have kept up the appearance of being Catholic to avoid danger: he was twice married, had his children baptized, and was buried according to the Catholic faith.

A collection of Paré&#x27;s works (he published these separately throughout his life, based on his experiences treating soldiers on the battlefield) was published at Paris in 1575. They were frequently reprinted, several editions appeared in German and Dutch, and among the English translations was that of Thomas Johnson (1634).

==Bezoar stone experiment==
In 1567, Ambroise Paré described an experiment to test the properties of bezoar stones. At the time, the stones were commonly believed to be able to cure the effects of any poison, but Paré believed this to be impossible. It happened that a cook at Paré&#x27;s court was caught stealing fine silver cutlery, and was condemned to be hanged. The cook agreed to be poisoned instead, on the condition that he would be given a bezoar straight after the poison and go free in case he survived. The stone did not cure him, and he died in agony seven hours after being poisoned. Thus Paré had proved that bezoars could not cure all poisons.

==Forensics==
Paré&#x27;s writings further include the results of his methodical studies on the effects of violent death on internal organs. He also created and wrote, &quot;Reports in Court&quot;, a procedure on the writing of legal reports in relation to medicine. His writings and instructions are known as the beginning of modern forensic pathology.

==Prostheses==
Paré contributed both to the practice of surgical amputation and the design of limb prostheses. He also invented some ocular prostheses, making artificial eyes from enameled gold, silver, porcelain and glass.

==Honours==
Asteroid 259344 Paré, discovered by French amateur astronomer Bernard Christophe in 2003, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 14 February 2014 ().

<text>The SETI Institute is a not-for-profit research organization incorporated in 1984 whose mission is to explore, understand, and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe, and to use this knowledge to inspire and guide present and future generations, sharing knowledge with the public, the press, and the government. SETI stands for the &quot;search for extraterrestrial intelligence&quot;.

The institute consists of three primary centers: The Carl Sagan Center, devoted to the study of life in the universe; the Center for Education, focused on astronomy, astrobiology and space science for students and educators; and the Center for Public Outreach, which produces &quot;Big Picture Science&quot;, the institute&#x27;s general science radio show and podcast, and &quot;SETI Talks&quot;, its weekly colloquium series.

==History==
The SETI Institute was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) California nonprofit organization in 1984 by Thomas Pierson (former CEO), and Dr. Jill Tarter. Financial and leadership support over the life of the SETI Institute has included Carl Sagan, Bernard Oliver, David Packard, William Hewlett, Gordon Moore, Paul Allen, Nathan Myhrvold, Lewis Platt, and Greg Papadopoulos. Two Nobel laureates have been associated with the SETI Institute: Charles Townes, key inventor of the laser, and the late Baruch Blumberg, who developed the Hepatitis B vaccine. Within the SETI Institute, Andrew Siemion heads the SETI effort. Seth Shostak is the host of Big Picture Science. Dr. David Morrison was the director of the Carl Sagan Center, until August 2015, when Nathalie Cabrol was appointed as director. Edna DeVore, the director of education and public outreach beginning in 1992, retired in 2018, at which time Pamela Harman became the new director of education. The SETI Institute is headquartered in Mountain View, California. In 2015, Silicon Valley businessman Bill Diamond was appointed as CEO.

On 13 February 2015, scientists (including David Grinspoon, Seth Shostak, and David Brin) at an annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, discussed Active SETI and whether transmitting a message to possible intelligent extraterrestrials in the cosmos was a good idea. That same week, a statement was released, signed by many in the SETI community, that a &quot;worldwide scientific, political and humanitarian discussion must occur before any message is sent&quot;. On 28 March 2015, a related essay was written by Seth Shostak and published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In January 2019, it was reported that the institute was looking for moons around 486958 Arrokoth.

==Primary centers==
===Carl Sagan Center===

The Carl Sagan Center is named in honor of Carl Sagan, former trustee of the institute, astronomer, prolific author and host of the original &quot;Cosmos&quot; television series. The Carl Sagan Center is home to over 80 scientists and researchers organized around six research thrusts: astronomy and astrophysics, exoplanets, planetary exploration, climate and geoscience, astrobiology and SETI. Guided by the astrobiology roadmap charted by the Drake Equation, the scientists of the Carl Sagan Center endeavor to understand the nature and proliferation of life in the universe and the transitions from physics to chemistry, chemistry to biology and biology to philosophy. Most of the research undertaken within the Carl Sagan Center is funded by grants from NASA, while SETI endeavors are funded exclusively by private philanthropy. The institute&#x27;s SETI researchers use both radio and optical telescope systems to search for deliberate signals from technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations.

The SETI Institute employs over 100 researchers that study all aspects of the search for life, its origins, the environment in which life develops, and its ultimate fate. They include Laurance Doyle, Peter Jenniskens, Pascal Lee, Mark R. Showalter, Franck Marchis, and Janice Bishop.

===Center for Education===
The Center for Education promotes STEM education through NASA and NSF-funded programs aimed at teaching and inspiring children, young adults and educators in physical sciences with emphasis on astronomy and astrobiology.

The Airborne Astronomy Ambassadors program brings research to American middle and high school teachers. Selected science educators take a crash-course in astronomy and experience two sorties on the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) modified 747 aircraft, operated by NASA and the German Space Agency.

In 2016, the institute received a five-year grant from NASA for an institute-conceived STEM program for the Girl Scouts of the USA. In partnership with the University of Arizona, the Girl Scouts of Northern California and the Girl Scouts of the USA, the SETI Institute launched &quot;Reaching for the Stars: NASA Science for Girl Scouts.&quot; This will develop a new series of merit badges based on a STEM curriculum for girls aged 5 to 18.

Funded by the National Science Foundation, SETI Institute operates a summer internship program for college students. Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) is an eight-week summer internship that pairs students with institute mentor/scientists.

Bringing the Excitement of NASA Science to the Nation&#x27;s Community Colleges, NASA Community College Network is a newly funded (2021) initiative to bring NASA subject matter experts (SME), research findings, and science resources into the nation&#x27;s community college system.

===Center for Public Outreach===
The Center for Public Outreach brings the work of the SETI Institute and other leading research organizations, to the general public through its weekly radio broadcast and podcast – &quot;Big Picture Science&quot; and the weekly lecture series &quot;SETI Talks.&quot; Big Picture Science is hosted by the institute&#x27;s Senior Astronomer, Seth Shostak and co-hosted by Executive Producer Molly Bentley. The award-winning general science program engages the public with modern science research through lively and intelligent storytelling and interviews with leading authors, educators and researchers in wide-ranging disciplines. The show mixes engaging and topical science with a dash of humor and proves the thesis that science radio doesn&#x27;t have to be dull! The institute&#x27;s weekly colloquium series – SETI Talks, is an in-depth one-hour lecture featuring leading researchers from around the world in astronomy, astrophysics, aerospace technology, astrobiology, machine learning and more. Lectures are free of charge, open to the public and presented at Microsoft&#x27;s Silicon Valley Campus in Mountain View, California. All SETI Talks are video-taped and archived on YouTube. Over 350 lectures are available on-line, and indexed on the institute&#x27;s website.

==Instruments==
Instruments used by SETI Institute scientists include the ground-based Allen Telescope Array; several ground-based optical telescopes, such as the Shane telescope at Lick Observatory, the W.M. Keck telescopes and IRTF in Hawaii; and the Very Large Telescopes in Chile. They also use space-based telescopes including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Spitzer Space Telescope, Kepler, TESS, and the Herschel Space Telescope.

SETI scientists are involved in space missions, including the &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission toward Pluto, the &quot;Cassini&quot; mission previously in orbit around Saturn, the Mars Rovers &quot;Opportunity&quot; and &quot;Curiosity&quot;, the &quot;Kepler&quot; mission, and the &quot;TESS&quot; mission. They also cooperate with NASA in the CAMS meteor-tracking network.

==Funding supporters==
Funding for SETI Institute programs comes from a variety of sources. Contrary to popular belief, and their Form 990, no government funds are allocated for its SETI searches – these are financed entirely by private contributions. Other astrobiology research at the SETI Institute may be funded by NASA, the National Science Foundation, or other grants and donations. TeamSETI is the SETI Institute&#x27;s worldwide membership and support organization.

<text>The Libretto (Italian for &quot;booklet&quot;) is a line of subnotebook computers that was designed and produced by Toshiba. The line was distinguished by its combination of functionality and small size, squeezing a full Windows x86 PC into a device the size of a paperback book. 

The first Libretto model, the &quot;Libretto 20&quot;, was released on April 17, 1996 (in Japan only), with a volume of and weighing just , making it by far, the world&#x27;s smallest commercially available Windows PC at the time, and a trend the Libretto range continued for many years. The original Libretto line was discontinued in Europe and the U.S. in 1999, but the production continued in Japan with the SS, FF and then the L series until 2002. The first L series Libretto, larger than the previous range, was released on 18 May 2001 and the last on 24 April 2002. Production of all Librettos ceased from 2002 until the release of the Libretto U100 in 2005. It was a further five years before the Libretto returned again in 2010 with the limited-edition W100 model, a dual-screen tablet.

==Models==

There were many different models. The first Libretto models, the L20 &amp; L30 used 486 processors from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and were only available in Japan (although the L30 was also assembled and marketed in South Korea under the Comos Brand name). Beginning with the &quot;Libretto 50&quot;, Toshiba used the Intel Pentium and later Pentium MMX processors. With the introduction of the L series in 2001, a move was made to the Transmeta Crusoe processor. The U100 of 2005 saw a return to Intel with the use of the Pentium M processor.

The following models were available:

In 2001, Toshiba released the L series range of Librettos. This was the first major change of footprint since the range was first introduced and represented a significant improvement in performance over the previous models, however it also represented a significant increase in overall size. The L series had moved the Libretto range away from what was a UMPC, to that of an early Netbook.

The L1 had built-in USB and IEEE1394 Firewire. The L2 dropped the IEEE1394 in favor of an Ethernet port. The L5 was optionally available with built-in Wifi 802.11b. All models featured a widescreen display with the unusual resolution of 1280×600 pixels.

Like the majority of Librettos models produced, the L series were not officially available outside Japan.

In 2005, Toshiba announced a new model, the Libretto U100:

All three of the above were essentially the same machine but with different options. The U100 was available in Europe in these variants:

* 30 GB HDD (with Win XP Home)
* 60 GB HDD (with XP Pro), both versions included the DVD dock
* In Japan the clock speed was only 1.1 GHz
* In some markets the DVD dock was an optional or bundled accessory

In 2010, Toshiba announced a new Tablet Libretto model, the W100:

The W100 was released in August 2010, as a limited-edition model and was only available for a short time. It was available in both English and Japanese versions. There is no VGA port on the W100, the keyboard is virtual (standard, split, or 10-key numeric). The display can be viewed in portrait or landscape mode, though portrait is limited to one direction of change. The case has metal top.

<text>The Zhongsha Islands is a Chinese term for a collection of two skerries, many entirely submerged banks, seamounts, and shoals in the South China Sea. There are no islands in the Macclesfield Bank, the main part of Zhongsha. The Scarborough Shoal, which consists of two skerries, is not contiguous with the Macclesfield Bank but Chinese sources treat them as one chain of geographical features. The whole of the region is claimed by both the PRC and the ROC, and various bits of the eastern parts are claimed by the Philippines. No country has constant control of the whole region, and there are disputes - for example, see the Scarborough Shoal standoff.

The PRC claims to administer the area as Zhongsha Daojiao Town(中沙岛礁镇), a town under the Xisha District of the Sansha prefecture-level city in Hainan. It has one Village-level division, “Zhongsha Daojiao Residential Community”. However, the seat of this town and residential community is not within the Zhongsha Islets, but in Yongxing Town.

Aquaculture research has been conducted on Walker Shoal(the shoal is known as manbu ansha in chinese).

== Geography ==
The Zhongsha Islets include:

To the west, near the Paracel Islands:
* Macclesfield Bank (Zhongsha Dao)
** Walker Shoal (Manbu Ansha 漫步暗沙; )

To the east, near Luzon:
* Scarborough Shoal (Nanyan Dao 南巖島 or Huangyan Dao 黃岩島; )
** Nanyan skerry
** Beiyan skerry
* Truro Shoal (Sianfa Ansha or Shianfa Ansha 特魯暗沙; )

To the north:
* Helen Shoal (Itung Ansha or Yitong Ansha 一統暗沙; )
* Stewart Shoal (Ssu-ti-wa-erh-t&#x27;e Ansha 管事暗灘; )
* Huangyan Seamount (; )
* Shixing Seamount ()
* Xianbei Seamount ()
* Xiannan Seamount ()
* Zhangzhong Seamount ()
* Zhenbei Seamount ()

To the south, near the Spratly Islands:
* Dreyer Shoal (Zhongnan Ansha, 中南暗沙; )
* Zhongnan Seamount ()
* Longnan Seamount ()
* Changlong Seamount ()

<doc id="617561" wikidata="Q1485213" url="?curid=617561" title="The Black Rider">
<text>The Black Rider: The Casting of the Magic Bullets is a self-billed &quot;musical fable&quot; in the avant-garde tradition created through the collaboration of theatre director Robert Wilson, musician Tom Waits and writer William S. Burroughs. Wilson, in the original production, was largely responsible for the design and direction. Burroughs wrote the book, while Waits wrote the music and most of the lyrics. The project began in about 1988 when Wilson approached Waits. The story is based on the German folktale &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;, which had previously adapted as an opera by Carl Maria von Weber. It premiered at Hamburg&#x27;s Thalia Theatre on 31 March 1990, and was performed at Paris&#x27;s Théâtre du Châtelet on 9 October 1990. November Theatre produced its world English-language premiere in 1998 at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival in Canada. Det Norske Teatret in Oslo staged a Norwegian (Nynorsk) version in 1998, with Lasse Kolsrud as Pegleg. Only the dialogue was translated by the dramaturg and key collaborator of the entire creative process, Wolfgang Wiens; the songs were performed in English.

Waits recorded much of the music from the play in different arrangements as &quot;The Black Rider.&quot;

==Synopsis==

Wilhelm, a file clerk, falls in love with a huntsman&#x27;s daughter. In order to marry, Wilhelm must prove his worth as a hunter and gain her father&#x27;s approval, but, as &quot;a man of pen and ink,&quot; his shot is lousy and his hopes of marriage worsen. He is offered magic bullets by the devil, Pegleg – who assures him that his bullets will always have a sure shot. However, Pegleg stipulates that, while most of the bullets will hit anything Wilhelm pleases, one of the bullets is under Pegleg&#x27;s control. Foolish, naive, and overrun with desperate hope, Wilhelm accepts the Faustian pact. On the day of Wilhelm&#x27;s wedding, the final bullet strikes his beloved dead. He then goes mad, and joins the previous victims of Satan&#x27;s cunning in the Devil&#x27;s carnival.

Although based on folklore, the story contains strong autobiographical elements from Burroughs&#x27; own life: he shot and killed his own wife in a drunken attempt at recreating the William Tell legend, and the story as a whole may be construed as a warning tale about the destructive powers of addiction.

==Music==

The music was composed and performed by Tom Waits, and released as a record in 1993.

==Productions==
November Theatre produced its world English-language premiere in 1998 at the Edmonton International Fringe Festival in Canada, and the American English-language premiere at the New York International Fringe Festival in 1999.

The play premiered in Finnish in October 1998 by the Helsinki City Theatre, translated by Markku Salo, directed by Anneli Mäkelä, with a live Devil&#x27;s Rubato Band.

In 2004, UK producers Cultural Industry, London, Barbican Arts Centre, American Conservatory Theater, and the Sydney Festival, Australia, teamed together with Wilson and Waits to produce a touring production in English. Based heavily on the 1990 Thalia theatre production, and even containing some members of the original cast, it toured the world starting in London. The part of Pegleg was played by singer Marianne Faithfull, while Wilhelm was played by actor Matt McGrath. The remaining cast included Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, Soňa Červená, Richard Strange, Nigel Richards, Dean Robinson, Jack Willis, Janet Henfrey, Monica Tahal, Gabriella Santinelli and Jake Thornton.

The band, The Magic Bullets, was headed by Bent Clausen and David Coulter and featured Thomas Bloch, Terry Edwards, Caroline Hall, Jack Pinter, Rory McFarlane, and Kate St. John.

The show opened in May 2004 at London&#x27;s Barbican Arts Centre, and then transferred to San Francisco&#x27;s American Conservatory Theater later that year. In January 2005, the production headlined the Sydney Festival. However, due to ill health, Marianne Faithfull was forced to withdraw from the production and understudy Nigel Richards filled the part.

November Theatre&#x27;s production went on to tour Canada in 2004–2005 with presentations at Theatre Network in Edmonton, Ground Zero Theatre and the Calgary Opera, Persephone Theatre in Saskatoon, Yukon Arts Centre in Whitehorse, Intrepid Theatre in Victoria, and the PuSh International Performing Arts Festival in Vancouver. The production received six Elizabeth Sterling Haynes Awards in Edmonton and six Betty Mitchell Awards in Calgary including &quot;Best Production&quot; and &quot;Best Direction&quot; in both major centres. In 2006 the production was presented at the Magnetic North Theatre Festival in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. The production was remounted in Vancouver in January 2008 at the Arts Club Theatre, Granville Island stage, co-presented as part of the annual PuSh Festival. November Theatre produced its final showing at the Tarragon Theatre in Toronto in the fall of 2008.

In 2006, Los Angeles&#x27; Ahmanson Theatre re-staged the production, bringing the cast together for one final time. Several members of the original cast were unavailable, most notably Marianne Faithfull, whose role was filled by Vance Avery. The cast was also joined by John Vickery.

Following the concept of the director of the independent theatre, PanoDrama, Anna Lengyel the play was staged in the Hungarian National Theater during the Budapest Spring Festival in 2009 by renowned director Tamás Ascher. In 2022, another performance was staged in Hungary at the Örkény Színház, Budapest, directed by Csaba Polgár.

In Barcelona, &quot;The Black Rider&quot; was the first musical to open at Teatre Almeria. Produced by the Companyia Gataró starting December 2009, it was performed by Oscar Martínez (Wilhelm), Ferran Frauca (Robert), Bealia Guerra (Kätchen), Jordi Vidal (Pegleg), Muntsa Rius (Anne) and Frank Capdet (Bertram), plus special guest acting by Xavier Ribera-Vall (Kuno).

The play was also staged by in Estonia by VAT Theatre in 2011. It took place in Tallinn, which was a European Capital of Culture for 2011.

In November 2012, the play was presented at the Schaubühne in Berlin.

In 2014, the play was staged by Rogaland Teater in Stavanger, Norway.

In both 2000 and 2015, the play was staged by the Betty Nansen theatre in Copenhagen, Denmark, both times with Jimmy Jørgensen as Pegleg.

The work was performed by Victorian Opera as part of the 2017 Melbourne Festival, starring Kanen Breen and Meow Meow.

In 2018, it was staged at the Theater Regensburg.

<text>The GenBank sequence database is an open access, annotated collection of all publicly available nucleotide sequences and their protein translations. It is produced and maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; a part of the National Institutes of Health in the United States) as part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC).

In October 2024, GenBank contained 34 trillion base pairs from over 4.7 billion nucleotide sequences and more than 580,000 formally described species.

The database started in 1982 by Walter Goad and Los Alamos National Laboratory. GenBank has become an important database for research in biological fields and has grown in recent years at an exponential rate by doubling roughly every 18 months.

GenBank is built by direct submissions from individual laboratories, as well as from bulk submissions from large-scale sequencing centers.

==Submissions==
Only original sequences can be submitted to GenBank. Direct submissions are made to GenBank using BankIt, which is a Web-based form, or the stand-alone submission program, Sequin. Upon receipt of a sequence submission, the GenBank staff examines the originality of the data and assigns an accession number to the sequence and performs quality assurance checks. The submissions are then released to the public database, where the entries are retrievable by Entrez or downloadable by FTP. Bulk submissions of Expressed Sequence Tag (EST), Sequence-tagged site (STS), Genome Survey Sequence (GSS), and High-Throughput Genome Sequence (HTGS) data are most often submitted by large-scale sequencing centers. The GenBank direct submissions group also processes complete microbial genome sequences.

== History ==
Walter Goad of the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and others established the Los Alamos Sequence Database in 1979, which culminated in 1982 with the creation of the public GenBank. Funding was provided by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Defense. LANL collaborated on GenBank with the firm Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, and by the end of 1983 more than 2,000 sequences were stored in it.

In the mid-1980s, the Intelligenetics bioinformatics company at Stanford University managed the GenBank project in collaboration with LANL. As one of the earliest bioinformatics community projects on the Internet, the GenBank project started BIOSCI/Bionet news groups for promoting open access communications among bioscientists. During 1989 to 1992, the GenBank project transitioned to the newly created National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

==Growth==

The GenBank release notes for release 250.0 (June 2022) state that &quot;from 1982 to the present, the number of bases in GenBank has doubled approximately every 18 months&quot;. As of 15 June 2022, GenBank release 250.0 has over 239 million loci, 1,39 trillion nucleotide bases, from 239 million reported sequences.

The GenBank database includes additional data sets that are constructed mechanically from the main sequence data collection, and therefore are excluded from this count. 
==Limitations==
An analysis of Genbank and other services for the molecular identification of clinical blood culture isolates using 16S rRNA sequences showed that such analyses were more discriminative when GenBank was combined with other services such as EzTaxon-e and the BIBI databases.

GenBank may contain sequences wrongly assigned to a particular species, because the initial identification of the organism was wrong. A recent study showed that 75% of mitochondrial Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I sequences were wrongly assigned to the fish &quot;Nemipterus mesoprion&quot; resulting from continued usage of sequences of initially misidentified individuals. The authors provide recommendations how to avoid further distribution of publicly available sequences with incorrect scientific names.

Numerous published manuscripts have identified erroneous sequences on GenBank. These are not only incorrect species assignments (which can have different causes) but also include chimeras and accession records with sequencing errors. A recent manuscript on the quality of all Cytochrome b records of birds further showed that 45% of the identified erroneous records lack a voucher specimen that prevents a reassessment of the species identification.

Another problem is that sequence records are often submitted as anonymous sequences without species names (e.g. as &quot;&quot;Pelomedusa&quot; sp. A CK-2014&quot; because the species are either unknown or withheld for publication purposes. However, even after the species have been identified or published, these sequence records are not updated and thus may cause ongoing confusion.

<text>Peter Dombrovskis (; 2 March 194528 March 1996) was an Australian photographer, known for his Tasmanian scenes. In 2003, he was posthumously inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame, the first Australian photographer to achieve that honour.

==Biography==
Dombrovskis was born in 1945 in a refugee camp in Wiesbaden, Germany to Latvian parents. Together with his mother, he migrated to Australia in 1950, and they settled in , a suburb of . The protégé of noted wildlife photographer and activist Olegas Truchanas, his photographs of the Tasmanian Wilderness, particularly his own annual Tasmanian Wilderness Calendar and the Wilderness Calendar produced by the Tasmanian Wilderness Society, brought images of once remote and inaccessible areas of the state into the public realm. Dombrovskis founded West Wind Press in 1977 and later went on to print calendars entirely of his own work, featuring incisive commentary from pre-eminent environmental professionals.

His most famous photograph is &quot;Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River&quot;, which some commentators believe played a part in the victory of Bob Hawke in the 1983 Australian federal election. The photograph portrayed a section of the Franklin River which was to be submerged by the proposed Franklin Dam, and it highlighted the visual appeal of the Franklin River during the contentious &quot;No Dams&quot; campaign of 1982. In 1983, Dombrovskis published a book, &quot;Wild Rivers&quot;, co-authored with Bob Brown, which exemplified his skill in photographing the Gordon and Franklin rivers.

On 28 March 1996, Dombrovskis died of a heart attack while photographing near Mount Hayes, in the Western Arthurs mountain range in South-West Tasmania.

His works are represented in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra, the National Gallery of Victoria, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the Australian Heritage Commission, and in private hands.

<doc id="617567" wikidata="Q535179" url="?curid=617567" title="Handley Page Hastings">
<text>The Handley Page HP.67 Hastings is a retired British troop-carrier and freight transport aircraft designed and manufactured by aviation company Handley Page for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Upon its introduction to service during September 1948, the Hastings was the largest transport plane ever designed for the service.

Development of the Hastings had been initiated during the Second World War in response to Air Staff Specification C.3/44, which sought a new large four-engined transport aircraft for the RAF. Early on, development of a civil-oriented derivative had been prioritised by the company, but this direction was reversed following an accident. On 7 May 1946, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight; testing revealed some unfavourable flight characteristics, which were successfully addressed via tail modifications. The type was rushed into service so that it could participate in the Berlin Airlift; reportedly, the fleet of 32 Hastings to be deployed during the RAF operation delivered a combined total of 55,000 tons (49,900 tonnes) of supplies to the city.

As the RAF&#x27;s Hastings fleet expanded during the late 1940s and early 1950s, it supplemented and eventually replaced the wartime Avro York, a transport derivative of the famed Avro Lancaster bomber. RAF Transport Command operated the Hastings as the RAF&#x27;s standard long-range transport; as a logistics platform, it contributed heavily during conflicts such as the Suez Crisis and the Indonesian Confrontation. A handful were also procured by the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) to meet its transport needs. Beyond its use as a transport, several Hastings were modified to perform weather forecasting, training, and VIP duties. A civilian version of the Hastings, the Handley Page Hermes, was also produced, which only achieved limited sales. Hastings continued to be heavily used by RAF up until the late 1960s, the fleet being withdrawn in its entirety during 1977. The type was succeeded by various turboprop-powered designs, including the Bristol Britannia and the American-built Lockheed Hercules.

==Development==
Amid the latter years of the Second World War, the Air Ministry formulated and released Air Staff Specification C.3/44, which defined a new long-range general purpose transport to succeed the Avro York, a transport derivative of the Avro Lancaster bomber. British aviation company Handley Page made its own submission to meet C.3/44, the corresponding design being designated &quot;H.P.67&quot;. According to aviation periodical Flight International, the H.P.67 was an extremely aerodynamically clean design, as well as being relatively orthodox in terms of Handley Page methodology. Its basic configuration was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane with a conventional tail unit. It had all-metal tapering wings with dihedral, which had been designed for the abandoned HP.66 bomber development of the existing Handley Page Halifax; these wings were mated to a circular fuselage, which was suitable for pressurisation up to . It was provided with a retractable undercarriage and tailwheel.

In addition to the Hastings, a civilian version was also developed, the Hermes. Initially, development of the Hermes prototypes had been assigned a higher priority over the Hastings, but that programme was placed on hold after the prototype crashed during its first flight on 2 December 1945; thus Handley Page opted to concentrate its resources on completing the military Hastings variant. On 7 May 1946, the first of two Hastings prototypes (&quot;TE580&quot;) made its maiden flight from RAF Wittering. Flight testing soon demonstrated some issues, including lateral instability and relatively poor stall warning behaviour. To rectify these problems, both the prototypes and the first few production aircraft were urgently modified and tested with a temporary solution: a modified tailplane with 15° of dihedral, and the installation of an artificial stall warning system. These changes enabled the first production aircraft, designated &quot;Hastings C1&quot;, to enter service during October 1948.
The Royal Air Force (RAF) had initially placed an order for 100 Hastings C1s; however, the last six were manufactured as weather reconnaissance versions, referred to as the &quot;Hastings Met. Mk 1&quot;, while seven other aircraft were subsequently converted to this standard. These weather reconnaissance aircraft were stripped of their standard interiors, the space being instead occupied by meteorological measuring and recording equipment, along with a galley and wardroom to improve crew comfort during routine flights of up to nine hours. A total of eight C.1 aircraft were later converted to &quot;Hastings T5&quot; trainer configuration, which was used by RAF Bomber Command as a replacement for the Avro Lincoln at their Bombing School at RAF Lindholme. The conversion involved the installation of a large ventral radome; each aircraft could carry three trainee bomb aimers in a training section above the radome. The rear cabin retained a secondary passenger/cargo carrying area, giving it a limited transport capacity as well.

While tail modifications introduced to the C1 had allowed the type to enter service, a more definitive solution was provided in the form of an extended-span tailplane, which was mounted lower on the fuselage. An aircraft which had this modified tail installed, together with the fitting of additional fuel tanks within the outer wing, was predesignated as the &quot;Hastings C2&quot;; a further modified VIP transport variant, which was fitted with more fuel capacity to provide a longer range than standard aircraft, became the &quot;HP.94 Hastings C4&quot;.

By the end of production, 147 aircraft had been manufactured for the RAF; an additional four Hastings were built for the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), which gave a total of 151 aircraft.

==Design==

The Handley Page Hastings was a large purpose-built four-engine transport aircraft. It was furnished with several modern features, such as a Messier-built fully retractable undercarriage, which was operated hydraulically, and unprecedented stowage space for an RAF transport aircraft. Roughly 3,000 cubic feet of unrestricted area was used to house various cargoes or passengers. The cabin was fitted with a Plymax floor, complete with various grooves, channels, and lashing points for securing goods of varying sizes, while the walls were sound proofed and lined with plywood for increased comfort. Principal access is provided by a freight door on the port side, which incorporates a paratroop door, while a second paratroop door is present on the starboard side; on the ground, a rapidly deployable ramp suitable for road vehicles can also be used. In service, the aircraft was typically operated by a crew of five; it could accommodate either up to 30 paratroopers, 32 stretchers and 28 sitting casualties, or a maximum of 50 fully equipped troops.

In terms of its structure, the Hastings features a circular cross-section fuselage, which is constructed in three main sections from frames comprising rolled alloy. The frames are typically Z-section units using intercostal plate members, but the wing box makes use of larger I-section structures; these support a metal sheet covering that is rivetted directly onto stringer flanges. The maximum external diameter of 11 ft is maintained for a lengthy portion of the fuselage&#x27;s length, running both fore and aft of the wing. In order that the Hastings could carry loads too large for its interior, such as Jeeps and some artillery pieces, strong fixture points are present on the underside of the fuselage for the fitting of an under-fuselage carrier platform.

The fuselage is paired with a low-mounted cantilever wing, the connection between the two being smoothly faired. This wing comprised a twin-spar structure complete with inter-spar diaphragm-type ribs; the trailing edge ribs terminate just short of the slotted flaps. Furthermore, the leading edge of the wing&#x27;s center section was readily detachable, providing easy access to various electrical and control systems housed within the wing. The aircraft&#x27;s fuel tanks are located just inboard of the inner engine nacelles; retractable ejector pipes were present within the wing, which were used for jettisoning fuel when such action would be required by an emergency situation.

The Hastings was powered by an arrangement of four wing-mounted Bristol Hercules 101 sleeve valve radial engines. These engines were installed upon the leading edge of the wing via interchangeable power-eggs; the air intakes and thermostatically-controlled oil coolers were also present within the wing. A Vokes-build automated air cleaner was present upon each engine, typically deploying during landings and take-offs. Fire detection systems were also installed to alert the crew to such dangers, while fire extinguishers were also installed around each engine. The engines drove de Havilland-built hydromatic four-blade propellers, which could be individually feathered if required.

==Operational history==
The Hastings had been rushed into service with the RAF during September 1948 due to the pressing need for additional transport aircraft to meet the demands of the Berlin Airlift. Between September and October 1948, No. 47 Squadron rapidly replaced its fleet of Halifax A Mk 9s with the Hastings; the squadron conducted its first sortie using the type to Berlin on 11 November 1948. During the airlift, the Hastings fleet was intensively used, principally to carry shipments of coal to the city; before the end of the crisis, two further squadrons, 297 and 53, would be involved in the effort. The final sortie of the airlift was performed by a Hastings, which occurred on 6 October 1949; according to aviation historian Paul Jackson, the 32 Hastings deployed during the operation had delivered a total of 55,000 tons (49,900 tonnes) of supplies, during which two aircraft had been lost.

A total of one hundred Hastings C1 and 41 Hastings C2 were procured for service with RAF Transport Command, who commonly deployed the type upon its long-range routes, as well as some use as a tactical transport until well after the arrival of the faster turboprop-powered Bristol Britannia during 1959. A total of four VIP-configured Hastings were assigned to 24 Squadron. An example of the latter use was during the Suez Crisis of 1956, during which several Hastings of 70, 99 and 511 Squadrons dropped paratroopers on El Gamil airfield, Egypt.
Hastings continued to provide transport support to British military operations around the globe through the 1950s and 1960s, including dropping supplies to troops opposing Indonesian forces in Malaysia during the Indonesian Confrontation. During early 1968, the Hastings was withdrawn from RAF Transport Command, by which point it has been replaced by the American-built Lockheed Hercules and British-built Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy, both being newer turboprop-powered transports.

Starting in 1950, the Met Mk.1 weather reconnaissance aircraft were used by 202 Squadron, based at RAF Aldergrove, Northern Ireland; they were used by the Squadron up until its disbandment on 31 July 1964, having been rendered obsolete by the introduction of weather satellites. The Hastings T.Mk 5 remained in service as radar trainers well into the 1970s; the variant was used for other purposes as well during this time, such as the occasional transport, air experience, and search and rescue missions. The Hastings was even deployed for reconnaissance purposes during the Cod War with Iceland during the winter of 1975–76; it was finally withdrawn from service on 30 June 1977.

In addition to its use by the RAF, several Hastings were also procured by New Zealand, where they were operated by No. 40 and No. 41 Squadrons of the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). The service flew the type until it was replaced by American-built Lockheed C-130 Hercules during 1965. Four &quot;Hastings C.Mk 3&quot; transport aircraft were built and supplied to the RNZAF. One crashed at RAAF Base Darwin and caused considerable damage to the city water main, its railway and the road into the city. The other three were broken up at RNZAF Base Ohakea. During the period that the engines were having problems with their sleeve valves (lubricating oil difficulties) RNZAF personnel joked that the Hastings was the best three-engined aircraft in the world.

==Surviving aircraft==
Four Hastings are preserved in the UK and Germany:
* &quot;TG503&quot; (T5) on display at the Alliiertenmuseum (Allied Museum), Berlin, Germany. The Hastings on display here was a participant in the Berlin Airlift.
* &quot;TG511&quot; (T5) on display in the &quot;National Cold War Exhibition&quot; at the RAF Museum Cosford, England.
* &quot;TG517&quot; (T5) on display at the Newark Air Museum, Newark, England.
* &quot;TG528&quot; (C1A) on display at the Imperial War Museum, Duxford, England.
* &quot;NZ5801&quot; (C.3) 1952. Nose/Cockpit section only of RNZAF military transport is preserved at Auckland, New Zealand&#x27;s Museum of Transport and Technology along with engines, props and an undercarriage assembly, which is functional for display purposes.

==Accidents and incidents==
*16 July 1949 — Hastings TG611 lost control during takeoff at Berlin-Tegel Airport and dived into the ground due to incorrect tail trim; all five crew died.

<doc id="617568" wikidata="Q3801491" url="?curid=617568" title="Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis">
<text>Epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI), is a severe form of dry scaly skin, that initially presents with redness, blisters, erosions, and peeling in a newborn baby. Hyperkeratosis typically develops several months later. Other symptoms include itch, painful fissures, strong body odor, and absence of sweat. Symptoms vary in severity and extent of skin involvement. The two main types are divided into one involving palms and soles and the other without. 

EI is caused by a genetic mutation. The condition involves the clumping of keratin filaments.

The condition is rare, affecting around 1 in 200,000 to 300,000 babies. 

==Signs and symptoms==
EI is a severe form of dry scaly skin, that initially presents with redness, blisters, erosions, and peeling in a newborn baby. Hyperkeratosis typically develops several months later. Other symptoms include itch, painful fissures, body odor, and absence of sweat. Symptoms vary in severity and extent of skin involvement. Complications include infection and joint problems. Affected newborns are particularly at risk of dehydration, sepsis, and electrolyte imbalance.

==Cause and mechanism==
The condition is mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. To a lesser extent, a recessive form exists. It is caused by genetic mutations in the genes encoding the proteins keratin 1 or keratin 10, resulting in disruption of the structure of the epidermis. 

* Keratin 1 is associated with the variants affecting the palms and soles.
* Keratin 10 is associated with the variants in which these are unaffected.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is by its appearance, skin biopsy, and genetic testing. 

The condition can be diagnosed via exam that reveals; generalized redness; thick, generally dark, scales that tend to form parallel rows of spines or ridges, especially near large joints; the skin is fragile and blisters easily following trauma; extent of blistering and amount of scale is variable.

== Treatment ==
Treatment includes applying thick moisturisers. Other therapies include topical and oral retinoids. These include topical N-acetylcysteine, liarozole, and calcipotriol. Bacterial colonisation of skin may be reduced by use of antibacterial soaps, chlorhexidine, and dilute sodium hypochlorite baths.

== Research ==
Gene therapy is being studied for EI.

==Epidemiology==
The condition is rare, affecting around 1 in 200,000 to 300,000 babies. 

==History==
EI was first classified by its presence or absence in the palms and soles by DiGiovanna and Bale in 1994.

<text>Friedrich Karl Arnold Schwassmann (25 March 1870 – 19 January 1964) was a German astronomer and a discoverer of 22 minor planets and 4 comets, who worked at AOP in Potsdam and at Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg.

He was co-discoverer with Arno Arthur Wachmann of the periodic comets 29P/Schwassmann–Wachmann, 31P/Schwassmann–Wachmann and 73P/Schwassmann–Wachmann, and with Arno Arthur Wachmann and Leslie Peltier of the non-periodic comet C/1930 D1 (Peltier–Schwassmann–Wachmann). The main-belt asteroid 989 Schwassmannia, discovered by himself in 1922, was later named in his honor ().

<doc id="617571" wikidata="Q1471997" url="?curid=617571" title="Kapiti Island">
<text>Kapiti Island (), sometimes written as Kāpiti Island, is an island nature reserve located off the west coast of the lower North Island of New Zealand and within the Kāpiti Coast District. Parts of the island were previously farmed, but it is now a predator-free sanctuary for endemic birds, including many endangered birds. The island is long, running southwest/northeast, and roughly wide, being more or less rectangular in shape, and has an area of .

The island is separated from the North Island by the Rauoterangi Channel. The highest point on the island is Tūteremoana, . The seaward (west) side of the island is particularly rocky and has high cliffs, some hundreds of metres high, that drop straight into the sea. The cliffs are subject to very strong prevailing westerly winds and the scrubby vegetation that grows there is low and stunted by the harsh environmental conditions. A cross-section of the island would show almost a right-angled triangle, revealing its origins from lying on a fault line (part of the same ridge as the Tararua Range). The island&#x27;s vegetation is dominated by scrub and forest of kohekohe, tawa, and kanuka. Most of the forest is regenerating after years of burn-offs and farming, but some areas of original bush remain, with trees.

==Name and etymology==

The full original name for the island is Te Waewae-Kapiti-o-Tara-rāua-ko-Rangitāne, meaning &quot;the boundary of Tara and Rangitāne&quot; and referring to it as a place where the rohe (territories) of Ngāi Tara (now known as Muaūpoko) and Rangitāne (descendents of Whātonga) iwi adjoined each other. The word &quot;kapiti&quot; (meaning &#x27;to be joined&#x27;) is spelt without a macron, and is unrelated to the word &quot;kāpiti&quot; (cabbage). The island does not have an official name, but is recorded on topographical maps and hence in the New Zealand Gazetteer as &quot;Kapiti Island&quot;. In 2010 the Māori Language Commission acknowledged that, while the ordinary word &quot;kapiti&quot; does not have a macron, iwi of the Kāpiti region have evidence from history and local pronunciation that the place name is a variant form of &quot;āpiti&quot;, and that &quot;Kāpiti&quot; (with a macron) is correct. In the past, it was sometimes spelt &quot;Capiti Island&quot;.

The island also became known by Māori as Motu Rongonui, or the &quot;famous island&quot;. When James Cook visited New Zealand during his 1770 survey, he called it Entry Island or Entry Isle, but Cook&#x27;s name did not come into common use.

==History==

The Kāpiti Coast region has been occupied by Māori since the 12th century. Around the year 1150, Māori navigator Whātonga of the waka &quot;Kurahaupō&quot; divided the country into two sections: land from the southern tip of Kapiti Island north was given to his son Tautoki and his ancestors, who became Rangitāne iwi, and from the southern tip south was given to his son Tara and ancestors (Ngāi Tara, now known as Muaūpoko). The traditional name for the island refers to this division between Ngāi Tara and Rangitāne.

The island was surveyed in 1770 during the first voyage of James Cook. In the early 1800s, the island was in the rohe of Muaūpoko. Te Rauparaha of Ngāti Toa saw the advantage of settling on Kapiti Island, after noticing how Western ships frequented the Cook Strait area, who would be good trading partners. In 1821, amid pressure from tribes in the Waikato, Te Rauparaha led a migration of Ngāti Toa from Kawhia Harbour to the Cook Strait, and went on to settle on the Kapiti Coast and Waikanae in 1822, securing it and the island from Muaūpoko in 1823. The tribe regularly sailed in canoes on raiding journeys up to the Whanganui River and down to Marlborough. In the Battle of Waiorua (1824) the Ngāti Toa destroyed a force of 2,000 mainland warriors who had landed at the northern end of Kapiti in an attempt to capture the island.

Te Rauparaha encouraged European ships to visit Kapiti, which by 1830 became a centre for the New Zealand flax trade. By 1850, no members of Ngāti Toa permanently lived on the island, but occasionally visited for the island&#x27;s resources.

=== Ownership ===
Ownership of the island, and nearby Mana Island, reverted to Ngāti Toa on 31 December 2024 under a Treaty of Waitangi settlement.

=== Whaling ===
In the 1830s and 1840s, the island became one of the most developed areas in the country for whaling, due to the South Taranaki Bight and Cook Strait being whale nurseries. During whaling times 2,000 people were based on the island. There were seven whaling stations in and around Kapiti Island. Oil was melted from the blubber and shipped to America for use in machinery before petroleum was used. Five whaling stations were established on Kapiti, with three additional stations on the offshore islets of Tokomapuna, Motungarara and Tahoramaurea to the south-east. The whaling station on Waiorua Bay was surrounded by a &quot;rough township&quot;.

After the collapse of the whaling industry in the 1840s, whalers and their families left the island.

=== Deforestation and farming ===
The island was originally forested with rātā, kahikatea and rimu. Between 1825 and 1840 part of the island&#x27;s vegetation was burned to allow for farming. Between 1874 and the 1890s, the Māori Land Court partitioned the island into blocks, primarily owned by Western Maori MP Wiremu Parata and his family members. In the 1890s, the Wellington Acclimatisation Society requested that Alfred Ross, a leaseholder and sheep farmer on the island, turn his farm into a game reserve, releasing quail, pheasants and later brushtail possums onto the island.

By the 1900s, most of the island had been acquired by the New Zealand government for the reserve, except for a section in the north. As the land at the north end could no longer be leased to European farmers, it was farmed directly by Ngāti Toa as a sheep farm by the Webber family. The Webber family continued to farm on the island until the 1950s, most land being sold in 1967, however Ngāti Toa retain some land and rights of access to the island.

=== Wildlife reserve ===
Kapiti Island was identified in 1870 as a possible site for creating a bird sanctuary. By 1895, the government had begun considering making Kapiti Island into a wildlife reserve, due to the losses in native flora and fauna caused by introduced predators and deforestation across mainland New Zealand. Parata and his family members protested these plans, and in 1896 stated that they had no intention of selling the land to the government – by this time, Kapiti Island was the only part of the Ngāti Toa rohe still in Māori ownership. The Kapiti Island Public Reserve Act 1897 prohibited any further private sales of land on the island, and provided the basis for the island being acquired by the Crown, to be set aside as a nature reserve, with the exception of land still held by original Māori owners or their descendants.

In 1893 a pair of the now-extinct huia were going to be sent to Kapiti Island, but were instead taken to England as a present for Lord Rothschild. Suggestions were also made to move now-extinct South Island piopio to Kapiti Island, or another island, but this did not happen due to difficulty capturing the birds.

In 1924, the New Zealand Native Birds Protection Society (predecessor of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society), reported that there had been a significant improvement in the condition of the island, following a reduction in the number of animals. In 1928, goats were eradicated, which was followed by the eradication or eviction of cats, deer, sheep, cattle, pigs, and dogs.

In 1987 the Department of Conservation (DOC) took over administration of the island. In the 1980s and 1990s efforts were made to return the island to a natural state. First, sheep and possums were removed (over 22,500 possums were killed), then, in an action few thought possible for an island of its size, rats were eradicated by an aerial application of brodifacoum through September and October 1996. Ranger Peter Winston Daniel, who between 1980 and 1987 coordinated the programme which eradicated the pests, was recognised in the 1990 New Year Honours. The island was declared free of mammalian predators in 1999. In 2003 the anonymous Biodiversity Action Group claimed to have released 11 possums on the island, but no evidence of such were found.

Ngāti Toa Rangatira and Ātiawa ki Whakarongotai work with the Department of Conservation to guide conservation efforts on the island.

== Flora and fauna ==
=== Forest and vegetation ===
Currently 28% of Kapiti Island&#x27;s land area is covered by mixed forest and another 22% is covered by kanuka scrub forest. The most widespread forest types are kohekohe and tawa.

On 14 June 2007, one of the buildings at the Department of Conservation ranger station caught fire, sparking a major emergency operation to prevent the spread of fire to the native bush. Thirty firefighters were flown to the island and managed to contain the blaze, preventing serious damage to the ecosystem.

=== Birds ===
The island is home to a number of native bird species, mostly re-introduced. These include the takahē, North Island kōkako, brown teal (pāteke), stitchbird (hihi), North Island saddleback (tīeke), tomtit (miromiro), fantail (piwakawaka), morepork (ruru), weka and North Island robin (toutouwai). Five little spotted kiwi were translocated from the South Island to Kapiti Island in 1912. There are currently 1,200 little spotted kiwi on Kapiti Island, which are now extinct on the mainland. On 12 October 1912, three kākāpō were released on Kapiti Island. Rat eradication has led to increases in red-fronted parakeets, North Island robins, bellbirds, and saddlebacks. The island is considered one of New Zealand&#x27;s most important sites for bird recovery, and a breeding site for seabirds such as the sooty shearwater (tītī). However, sooty shearwaters have been under threat on the island because of predation by weka. Other birds that use the island for breeding include the spotted shag.

Kapiti Island is one of Wellington region&#x27;s &quot;coastal habitats of significance for indigenous birds&quot;. It provides predator-free nesting habitat to little blue penguins, red-billed gulls, white-fronted terns and reef herons. A further four Nationally Threatened or At Risk species occur on the coast of Kapiti Island – the black shag, Caspian tern, pied shag and variable oystercatcher.

North Island saddlebacks have been translocated from the Hauraki Gulf to Kapiti Island since 1981. The mean annual population growth rate for saddlebacks on Kapiti Island since 1998 has been 33%.

Between 1991 and 1997, 32 North Island kōkako were translocated to Kapiti Island. Between December 1991 and April 1994, 12 adults came from Te Rauamoa (four), Hauturu (one), Manawahe (five), and Makino (two). Between June 1995 and March 1996, seven kōkako came from Little Barrier Island. Five came from Mapara Wildlife Reserve in 1996, and eight came from the breeding programme of Pukaha / Mount Bruce National Wildlife Centre between 1994 and 1997. All the birds were banded. In 2002, the population of kōkako on the island was 39, and 10 of 32 translocated kōkako had survived.

=== Lizards ===
The island is home to a number of lizard species, including the &quot;Oligosoma polychroma&quot;, brown skink, copper skink, common gecko, ornate skink, forest gecko, and Wellington green gecko. After the eradication of pests, the population of some of these multiplied by rates between 2 times and 28 times. Gold-striped geckos were discovered on Kapiti Island in 2013.

=== Bats ===
New Zealand long-tailed bats live on Kapiti. Twenty southern lesser short-tailed bats were translocated from the Tararua Range to Kapiti Island by the Department of Conservation in April 2005, but they suffered health problems and the translocation was unsuccessful. , bats have only been observed in the eastern side of the island. In February 1969 an attempt was made to locate the long-tailed bat colony. For four nights, mist nets were placed in the Te Rere burial caves, and hollow trees were examined along with more burial caves. These efforts went unsuccessful, and the colony was not found, despite sightings of bats in this time period.

=== Invertebrates ===
Invertebrates on the island include cave wētā, Kapiti ground wētā, cicada, &quot;Lycaena salustius&quot;, pūriri moth, tunnel web spider, stick insect, ngāokeoke and the giraffe weevil.

=== Introduced predators ===
In 1999, the Minister of Conservation declared that the island was free of rats and other mammalian predators. The island has over 200 traps for rodents and mustelids.

A stoat, an introduced mustelid responsible for decimating the bird life in New Zealand, was seen on the island in December 2010, and by August the next year the Department of Conservation had removed three of them. It is believed that they reached Kapiti Island by a combination of drifting and swimming from the mainland.

=== Marine reserve ===

The Kapiti Marine Reserve was established in 1992. No fishing is allowed in this reserve, but swimming, diving and snorkelling are permitted. The reserve is split into eastern and western sections. The eastern section is and extends from Kapiti Island to the Waikanae Estuary Scientific Reserve. There is a 70 m deep channel with strong currents between the island and the Waikanae coast. Whales were regularly seen in the passage until the 20th century. The western section of the reserve is an area of to the west of Kapiti Island, and is known for its pāua and rock lobsters. Other marine life around Kapiti Island includes the common dolphin, New Zealand fur seal, orca, and the eagle ray.

== Climate ==
There is a weather station at Rangatira Bay that measures rainfall, wet and dry-bulb temperatures, wind speed and direction, cloud cover, and visibility. On average, the island experiences 1,064 mm of annual rainfall. February is the warmest month with a mean temperature of 16.9 °C, July is the coldest with a mean of 8.9 °C. Kapiti Island only experiences an average of 0.4 frosts per year. Most wind comes from the north-west. Kapiti&#x27;s tawa forest is often covered by a cloud cap which causes increased precipitation and soil moisture in the area, and decreased temperature and sunlight.

== Geology and geography ==
Kapiti Island is long and wide, with an area of . It is 30 kilometres north of Wellington, and separated from the mainland by the Rauoterangi Channel. Several islets are located in the channel close to island, including Tokomāpuna Island / Aeroplane Island, Tahoramaurea Island / Browns Island and Motungārara Island / Fishermans Island.

There are multiple active fault lines around both sides of Kapiti Island. The eastern side of Kapiti Island has steep cliffs which were created due to uplift from an offshore fault and waves causing erosion on the island. A submarine canyon called the Kapiti Seavalley runs parallel to the island, approximately seven kilometres to the west. On the north of the island is a freshwater lake called Ōkupe Lagoon. There are several streams which travel eastwards. The highest point on the island is named Tūteremoana, which is above sea level.

Most of the island in owned by the Crown, with a small part owned by Māori. The islets surrounding Kapiti are also Māori-owned.

== Heritage sites ==
Kapiti Island has several sites recognised by Heritage New Zealand.

One such building is named &#x27;The Whare&#x27;, which is located around the centre of the island. It is the oldest building on Kapiti Island and is New Zealand&#x27;s oldest building associated with conservation. The construction date of this building is not known, but evidence suggests that it was built in 1880 or earlier. The building was used to accommodate people involved with the farming of sheep on the island at the time. After the island became a nature reserve, the Whare housed caretakers and conservationists, including Richard Henry. After a building specially made for caretakers was constructed in the early 20th century, the Whare was used to house guests of the island instead.

Another heritage site is Te Kahuoterangi Whaling Station, a whaling station built between the 1830s and 1840s. It is about a kilometre south of Waiorua Bay and is under coastal forest and dense scrub. It is not known when operation of the station started, but evidence suggests that the station was in operation in 1839 and ended in 1843. In 1843 it was the station of multiple boats. The remains of the station are considered to be some of the most intact shore stations in New Zealand. In 1910, twenty stone hearths had been found.

== Tourism ==
Kapiti Island is a predator-free nature reserve and access is restricted. Visitors must have a permit to land on the island, and this is usually arranged via tourism operators. Access to Rangatira, a location half-way along the eastern shore is limited to a maximum of 100 visitors per day, and access to the north end is limited to 60 visitors per day. Visitors are not allowed to stay overnight in the area around Rangatira managed by the Department of Conservation. However, there is a private lodge at Waioura Bay on the north end of the island, operated by Kapiti Island Nature Tours where visitors can stay overnight.

Walking tracks for visitors landing at the Rangatira area include the Rangatira Loop Track which is and takes approximately 90 minutes. This is a loop and goes through regenerating forest, coastal shrubland, and the Rangatira wetland via a boardwalk. This track allows visitors to see trypots previously used for rendering whale blubber, and the historic Whare. The Wilkinson Track is one way, and takes approximately 2 hours to complete. It passes through a picnic area and a feeding station for hihi on the route to the summit of the island. The Trig Track is one way, and ascends to near the summit, taking approximately 2 hours to complete. The Okupe Valley Loop Track is and takes approximately 90 minutes, going to cliffs on the west of Kapiti Island. The Boulder Bank Loop Track is and takes approximately 45 minutes, following the coastline around the boulder bank. It is closed between October and March to prevent people disturbing nesting birds.

==Film and television==
A film for television &quot;Island of Spirits&quot;, was made by Alistair Te Ariki Campbell in 1973, exploring the history of the island from the time of it being a base for Māori chief Te Rauparaha, to being the site of whaling stations and then its transition to a bird sanctuary. The 2005 film &quot;King Kong&quot; was filmed partly on Kapiti Island. The island was used as a filming location alongside other parts of the Kāpiti Coast in a film called &quot;Poppy&quot; (2021), about a girl with Down syndrome.

<text>Multiple choice (MC), objective response or MCQ(for multiple choice question) is a form of an objective assessment in which respondents are asked to select only the correct answer from the choices offered as a list. The multiple choice format is most frequently used in educational testing, in market research, and in elections, when a person chooses between multiple candidates, parties, or policies.

Although E. L. Thorndike developed an early scientific approach to testing students, it was his assistant Benjamin D. Wood who developed the multiple-choice test. Multiple-choice testing increased in popularity in the mid-20th century when scanners and data-processing machines were developed to check the result. Christopher P. Sole created the first multiple-choice examinations for computers on a Sharp Mz 80 computer in 1982.

==Nomenclature==
Single Best Answer (SBA or One Best Answer) is a written examination form of MCQ used extensively in medical education. This form, from which the candidate must choose the best answer, has been distinguished from &quot;Single Correct Answer&quot; forms, which can produce confusion where more than one of the possible answers has some validity. The SBA form makes it explicit that more than one answer may have elements that are correct, but that one answer will be superior.

== Structure ==
Multiple choice items consist of a stem and several alternative answers. The &quot;stem&quot; is the opening—a problem to be solved, a question asked, or an incomplete statement to be completed. The options are the possible answers that the examinee can choose from, with the correct answer called the &quot;key&quot; and the incorrect answers called &quot;distractors&quot;. Only one answer may be keyed as correct. This contrasts with multiple response items in which more than one answer may be keyed as correct.

Usually, a correct answer earns a set number of points toward the total mark, and an incorrect answer earns nothing. However, tests may also award partial credit for unanswered questions or penalize students for incorrect answers, to discourage guessing. For example, the SAT Subject tests remove a quarter point from the test taker&#x27;s score for an incorrect answer.

For advanced items, such as an applied knowledge item, the stem can consist of multiple parts. The stem can include extended or ancillary material such as a vignette, a case study, a graph, a table, or a detailed description which has multiple elements to it. Anything may be included as long as it is necessary to ensure the utmost validity and authenticity to the item. The stem ends with a lead-in question explaining how the respondent must answer. In a medical multiple choice items, a lead-in question may ask &quot;What is the most likely diagnosis?&quot; or &quot;What pathogen is the most likely cause?&quot; in reference to a case study that was previously presented.

The items of a multiple choice test are often colloquially referred to as &quot;questions,&quot; but this is a misnomer because many items are not phrased as questions. For example, they can be presented as incomplete statements, analogies, or mathematical equations. Thus, the more general term &quot;item&quot; is a more appropriate label. Items are stored in an item bank.

== Examples ==
Ideally, the multiple choice question (MCQ) should be asked as a &quot;stem&quot;, with plausible options, for example:
(The correct answers are B, C and A respectively.)

A well written multiple-choice question avoids obviously wrong or implausible distractors (such as the non-Indian city of Detroit being included in the third example), so that the question makes sense when read with each of the distractors as well as with the correct answer.

A more difficult and well-written multiple choice question is as follows:

== Advantages ==
There are several advantages to multiple choice tests. If item writers are well trained and items are quality assured, it can be a very effective assessment technique. If students are instructed on the way in which the item format works and myths surrounding the tests are corrected, they will perform better on the test. On many assessments, reliability has been shown to improve with larger numbers of items on a test, and with good sampling and care over case specificity, overall test reliability can be further increased.

Multiple choice tests often require less time to administer for a given amount of material than would tests requiring written responses.

Multiple choice questions lend themselves to the development of objective assessment items, but without author training, questions can be subjective in nature. Because this style of test does not require a teacher to interpret answers, test-takers are graded purely on their selections, creating a lower likelihood of teacher bias in the results. Factors irrelevant to the assessed material (such as handwriting and clarity of presentation) do not come into play in a multiple-choice assessment, and so the candidate is graded purely on their knowledge of the topic. Finally, if test-takers are aware of how to use answer sheets or online examination tick boxes, their responses can be relied upon with clarity. Overall, multiple choice tests are the strongest predictors of overall student performance compared with other forms of evaluations, such as in-class participation, case exams, written assignments, and simulation games.

Prior to the widespread introduction of SBAs into medical education, the typical form of examination was true-false questions. But during the 2000s, educators found that SBAs would be superior.

== Disadvantages ==
The most serious disadvantage is the limited types of knowledge that can be assessed by multiple choice tests. Multiple choice tests are best adapted for testing well-defined or lower-order skills. Problem-solving and higher-order reasoning skills are better assessed through short-answer and essay tests. However, multiple choice tests are often chosen, not because of the type of knowledge being assessed, but because they are more affordable for testing a large number of students. This is especially true in the United States and India, where multiple choice tests are the preferred form of high-stakes testing and the sample size of test-takers is large respectively.

Another disadvantage of multiple choice tests is possible ambiguity in the examinee&#x27;s interpretation of the item. Failing to interpret information as the test maker intended can result in an &quot;incorrect&quot; response, even if the taker&#x27;s response is potentially valid. The term &quot;multiple guess&quot; has been used to describe this scenario because test-takers may attempt to guess rather than determine the correct answer. A free response test allows the test taker to make an argument for their viewpoint and potentially receive credit.

In addition, even if students have some knowledge of a question, they receive no credit for knowing that information if they select the wrong answer and the item is scored dichotomously. However, free response questions may allow an examinee to demonstrate partial understanding of the subject and receive partial credit. Additionally if more questions on a particular subject area or topic are asked to create a larger sample then statistically their level of knowledge for that topic will be reflected more accurately in the number of correct answers and final results.

Another disadvantage of multiple choice examinations is that a student who is incapable of answering a particular question can simply select a random answer and still have a chance of receiving a mark for it. If randomly guessing an answer, there is usually a 25 percent chance of getting it correct on a four-answer choice question. It is common practice for students with no time left to give all remaining questions random answers in the hope that they will get at least some of them right. Many exams, such as the Australian Mathematics Competition and the SAT, have systems in place to negate this, in this case by making it no more beneficial to choose a random answer than to give none.

Another system of negating the effects of random selection is formula scoring, in which a score is proportionally reduced based on the number of incorrect responses and the number of possible choices. In this method, the score is reduced by the number of wrong answers divided by the average number of possible answers for all questions in the test, &quot;w&quot;/(&quot;c&quot; – 1) where &quot;w&quot; is the &quot;number of wrong responses on the test&quot; and &quot;c&quot; is &quot;the average number of possible choices for all questions on the test&quot;. All exams scored with the three-parameter model of item response theory also account for guessing. This is usually not a great issue, moreover, since the odds of a student receiving significant marks by guessing are very low when four or more selections are available.

Additionally, it is important to note that questions phrased ambiguously may confuse test-takers. It is generally accepted that multiple choice questions allow for only one answer, where the one answer may encapsulate a collection of previous options. However, some test creators are unaware of this and might expect the student to select multiple answers without being given explicit permission, or providing the trailing encapsulation options.

Critics like philosopher and education proponent Jacques Derrida, said that while the demand for dispensing and checking basic knowledge is valid, there are other means to respond to this need than resorting to crib sheets.

Despite all the shortcomings, the format remains popular because MCQs are easy to create, score and analyse.

== Changing answers ==
The theory that students should trust their first instinct and stay with their initial answer on a multiple choice test is a myth worth dispelling. Researchers have found that although some people believe that changing answers is bad, it generally results in a higher test score. The data across twenty separate studies indicate that the percentage of &quot;right to wrong&quot; changes is 20.2%, whereas the percentage of &quot;wrong to right&quot; changes is 57.8%, nearly triple. Changing from &quot;right to wrong&quot; may be more painful and memorable (Von Restorff effect), but it is probably a good idea to change an answer after additional reflection indicates that a better choice could be made. In fact, a person&#x27;s initial attraction to a particular answer choice could well derive from the surface plausibility that the test writer has intentionally built into a distractor (or incorrect answer choice). Test item writers are instructed to make their distractors plausible yet clearly incorrect. A test taker&#x27;s first-instinct attraction to a distractor is thus often a reaction that probably should be revised in light of a careful consideration of each of the answer choices. Some test takers for some examination subjects might have accurate first instincts about a particular test item, but that does not mean that all test takers should trust their first instinct.

<doc id="617574" wikidata="Q2416215" url="?curid=617574" title="Era of Stagnation">
<text>The &quot;Era of Stagnation&quot; (, or ) is a term coined by Mikhail Gorbachev in order to describe the negative way in which he viewed the economic, political, and social policies of the Soviet Union that began during the rule of Leonid Brezhnev (1964–1982) and continued under Yuri Andropov (1982–1984) and Konstantin Chernenko (1984–1985). It is sometimes called the &quot;Brezhnevian Stagnation&quot; in English.

== Terminology ==
During the period of Brezhnev&#x27;s leadership, the term &quot;Era of Stagnation&quot; was not used. Instead in Soviet ideology the term &quot;period of developed socialism&quot; () was used for the period that started in 1967. This Soviet concept was officially declared at the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1971. It stemmed from the failure of Khrushchev&#x27;s promise in 1961 of reaching communism in 20 years and was a replacement for the concept &quot;period of the extensive construction of communism&quot; (). It was in the 1980s that the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev coined the term &quot;Era of Stagnation&quot; to describe the economic difficulties that developed when Leonid Brezhnev led the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982. Scholars have subsequently disagreed on the dates, significance and causes of the stagnation. Supporters of Gorbachev have criticised Brezhnev, and the Brezhnev administration in general, for being too conservative and failing to change with the times.

== History ==

After the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in 1953, a program of policy change was begun, later known as de-Stalinization. Nikita Khrushchev, who succeeded Stalin&#x27;s brief successor Georgy Malenkov as Soviet leader, introduced relatively liberal reforms during the period known as the Khrushchev Thaw. This period also brought an economic increase that topped at 6%. The Manege Affair of 1962, during which Khrushchev publicly criticised an exhibition of Soviet art, led to the reassertion of Communist Party control over the arts and marked the beginning of the end of the Cultural Thaw.

Brezhnev replaced Khrushchev as Soviet leader in 1964. The Brezhnev Era (1964–1982) began with high economic growth and soaring prosperity, but gradually significant problems in social, political, and economic areas accumulated. Social stagnation began following Brezhnev&#x27;s rise to power, when he revoked several of Khrushchev&#x27;s reforms and partially rehabilitated Stalinist policies. Some commentators regard the start of social stagnation as being the Sinyavsky–Daniel trial in 1966, in which two writers were convicted of anti-Soviet agitation and which marked the end of the Khrushchev Thaw. Others place it at the time of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 that suppressed the Prague Spring. The period&#x27;s political stagnation is associated with the establishment of gerontocracy, which came into being as part of the policy of stability.

The majority of scholars set the starting year for economic stagnation at 1975, although some claim that it began as early as the 1960s. Industrial growth rates declined during the 1970s as heavy industry and the arms industry were prioritized while Soviet consumer goods were neglected. The value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion roubles. Historians, scholars, and specialists are uncertain what caused the stagnation, with some arguing that the command economy suffered from systemic flaws that inhibited growth. Others have argued that the lack of reform, or the high expenditures on the military, led to stagnation.

Brezhnev has been criticised posthumously for doing too little to improve the economic situation. Throughout his rule, no major reforms were initiated and the few proposed reforms were either very modest or opposed by the majority of the Soviet leadership. The reform-minded Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Government), Alexei Kosygin, introduced two modest reforms in the 1970s after the failure of his more radical 1965 reform, and attempted to reverse the trend of declining growth. By the 1970s, Brezhnev had consolidated enough power to stop any &quot;radical&quot; reform-minded attempts by Kosygin.

After the death of Brezhnev in November 1982, Yuri Andropov succeeded him as Soviet leader. Brezhnev&#x27;s legacy was a Soviet Union that was much less dynamic than it had been when he assumed power in 1964. During Andropov&#x27;s short rule, modest reforms were introduced; he died little more than a year later in February 1984. Konstantin Chernenko, his successor, continued much of Andropov&#x27;s policies. The economic problems that began under Brezhnev persisted into these short administrations and scholars still debate whether the reform policies that were followed improved the economic situation in the country.

The Era of Stagnation ended with Gorbachev&#x27;s rise to power during which political and social life was democratised even though the economy was still stagnating. Under Gorbachev&#x27;s leadership the Communist Party began efforts to accelerate economic development in 1985 through massive injections of finance into heavy industry &quot;(Uskoreniye)&quot;. When these failed, the Communist Party restructured &quot;(perestroika)&quot; the Soviet economy and government by introducing quasi-capitalist &quot;(Khozraschyot)&quot; and democratic &quot;(demokratizatsiya)&quot; reforms. These were intended to re-energize the Soviet Union but inadvertently led to its dissolution in 1991.

=== Analysis ===
Robert Service, author of the &quot;History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-first Century&quot;, claims that with mounting economic problems worker discipline decreased, which the government could not counter effectively because of the full employment policy. According to Service, this policy led to government industries, such as factories, mines and offices, being staffed by undisciplined and unproductive personnel ultimately leading to a &quot;work-shy workforce&quot; among Soviet workers and administrators. While the Soviet Union under Brezhnev had the &quot;second greatest industrial capacity&quot; after the United States, and produced more &quot;steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and ... tractors&quot; than any other country in the world, Service treats the problems of agriculture during the Brezhnev era as proof of the need for de-collectivization. In short, Service considers the Soviet economy to have become &quot;static&quot; during this time period, and Brezhnev&#x27;s policy of stability was a &quot;recipe for political disaster&quot;.

Richard Sakwa, author of the book &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union: 1917–1991&quot;, takes a dimmer view of the Brezhnev era by claiming that growth rates fell &quot;inexorably&quot; from the 1950s until they stopped completely in the 1980s. His reasoning for this stagnation was the growing demand for unskilled workers resulted in a decline of productivity and labour discipline. Sakwa believes that stability itself led to stagnation and claimed that without strong leadership &quot;Soviet socialism had a tendency to relapse into stagnation.&quot;

According to Edwin Bacon and Mark Sandle, authors of &quot;Brezhnev Reconsidered&quot;, the economy under Brezhnev was as dynamic as the economy presided over by Nikita Khrushchev, but this dynamism had stalled by the time Yuri Andropov, and subsequently Konstantin Chernenko, became General Secretary. Mark Harrison claims that the economic performance of the Brezhnev era has not been looked at objectively as analysis of the period sometimes used lower estimates. Harrison further claims that in the period between 1928 and 1973 the Soviet economy grew in a phase that would surpass the United States &quot;one day&quot;. During the international oil crisis, growth in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc halted abruptly and stalled for a longer period than in the West causing the economy to begin stagnating. One explanation, according to Harrison, is that the Soviet economy could not sustain its extensive growth patterns. Other explanations include: the lack of Soviet, and communist bloc, transparency with other nations hindering globalisation and misinterpretation of a &quot;permanent&quot; post–World War II economic boom leading to faulty economic decisions. He claims that the economic policies of Andropov, and Chernenko, had improved the economic situation in the country and Mikhail Gorbachev inherited a more dynamic and vibrant economy in a &quot;pre-crisis situation&quot; where the economy was still growing with low internal and external debts, compared to the economy that Andropov and Chernenko inherited.

Archie Brown, author of &quot;The Rise and Fall of Communism&quot;, claims in his book that the term Era of Stagnation &quot;was in many ways a fitting description, for this was a period of declining growth&quot;, but noted it could be misleading in non-economic spheres. Brown states there were high growth rates in the mid-to-late 1960s (during the Eighth Five-Year Plan) claiming that the Soviet economy &quot;enjoyed stronger growth in the second half of the 1960s than it ever did thereafter&quot;. The link between these growth rates and the Kosygin reform is, according to Brown, &quot;tenuous&quot;, but says that &quot;From the point of view of communist rulers, the Brezhnev era was in many ways successful&quot;. The Soviet Union&#x27;s natural resources provided a strong economic foundation, which bore fruit during the 1973 oil crisis and &quot;turned out to be an energy bonanza&quot;. On the other hand, Brown states it was a sign of weakness that the Soviet Union grew so dependent on its natural resources, as it did in the 1970s.

Philip Hanson, author of &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Soviet economy: an Economic History of the USSR from 1945&quot;, claims that the label stagnation is not &quot;entirely unfair&quot;. Brezhnev, according to Hanson, did preside over a period of slowdown in economic growth, but claims that the era started with good growth that was at a higher rate than during the end of Khrushchev&#x27;s rule. Economic slowdown began in 1973 &quot;when even the official estimates began to show Soviet per capita production no longer closing the gap with the US.&quot; Before 1973, there was a reform period launched by Alexei Kosygin, which many believed would become as radical as those in the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia and the previous reform attempts in Hungary. According to Hanson, many assumed that growth during the Brezhnev era did not stop but started to stagnate. Not everything stagnated, as per capita consumption grew by 1.9% during the 1970s, which is a &quot;highly respectable rate&quot; of growth. Another point that Hanson makes is that, in contrast to the repressive policies of Joseph Stalin and instability-inducing policies of Khrushchev, the Brezhnev era was stable and a &quot;period of (comparative) plenty&quot;.

Robert Vincent Daniels in his book, &quot;Russia&#x27;s Transformation: Snapshots of a Crumbling System&quot;, claimed that the hallmark of the Brezhnev era was the &quot;status quo&quot;, which in turn led to the development of a great paradox; &quot;the contradictions of what it was and what it could be became obvious&quot;. Net growth, in excess of 50% and as high as two thirds, was primarily in the urban sector resulting in high population growth and urban growth higher than that of the United States. Industrial development continued to grow rapidly, and in certain sectors surpassed the United States. As an example, coal production in the Soviet Union increased from 85 million metric tons in 1964 to 149 million metric tons in 1981 while in the United States it grew from 100 million to 130 million metric tons in the same period. The Soviet Union became the largest exporter of petroleum in the world and by the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan (1976–1981) the Soviet GNP &quot;reached about 60% of the American level, and the net current investment was actually greater in absolute terms&quot;. The failure then, according to Daniels, was that the Soviet economy was not able to deliver in certain sectors; agriculture is a sector where this failure occurred. Throughout Soviet history, deficiencies in agriculture and consumer goods always existed. During Brezhnev&#x27;s reign, the Soviet Union became the largest producer of wheat in the world but was unable to produce meat in sufficient quantities. According to Daniels, the economy began to stagnate in 1975 rather than 1973 and that the following period contradicted the previous one &quot;in almost every way&quot;.

The research in second economy of the Soviet Union, pioneered by Gregory Grossman, indicated that during 1970s-1980s the effects of the central planning were progressively distorted due to the rapid growth of the shadow economy. It is suggested that failure to account for it by Gosplan contributed to the stagnation, and ultimately to the collapse of the Soviet economy.

=== Causes ===
One of the suggested causes of stagnation was the increased military expenditure over consumer goods and other economic spheres. Andrei Sakharov, the veteran dissident, claimed in a 1980 letter to Brezhnev that the increasing expenditure on the armed forces was stalling economic growth. David Michael Kotz and Fred Weir, authors of &quot;Revolution from Above: The Demise of the Soviet System&quot;, argue that militarisation cannot be the prime cause for the economic stagnation, as military spending had historically been high (17% of GNP in 1950) and had increased on par with economic growth without previously destabilising the economy.

During the Nixon Shock and the 1973 oil crisis, economic growth in the rest of the world plummeted but the Soviet hard currency earnings grew as a result of oil exports. Following the crisis, overall economic activity decreased markedly in the Soviet Union, the Western Bloc and Japan, but in the Soviet Union it was much more pronounced. Kotz and Weir argued that ultimately, economic stagnation in the Soviet Union could only have been caused by internal problems rather than external.

Some Marxist–Leninist writers have argued that economic stagnation was a result of revisionism in Soviet economic policy during Khrushchev&#x27;s leadership. According to authors like Harpal Brar, Khrushchev&#x27;s de-Stalinization program was also used to implement economic reforms that would move the USSR away from central planning and towards market socialism.

=== Summary ===

One of the main causes for Khrushchev&#x27;s dismissal from power was the relatively poor economic growth during the early 1960s. Overall economic growth was 6% from 1951 to 1955 but had fallen to 5.8% in the subsequent 5 years and to 5% from 1961 to 1965. Labour productivity, which had grown 4.7% from the 1950s to 1962, had declined to 4% by the early 1960s. Growth, capital out and investments were all showing signs of steady decline. Another problem was Khrushchev&#x27;s unrealistic promises such as committing to reach communism in 20 years, a near impossibility with the then-current economic indicators. Ultimately, as a result of his failure to deliver on his promises and the problems engendered, Khrushchev was dismissed in October 1964 by a collective leadership led by Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin. To counter Khrushchev&#x27;s promise of reaching communism, the Soviet leadership created the term developed socialism, which meant that the Soviet Union had developed to a sufficiently advanced stage that the country would move &quot;naturally&quot; to communism (in an unspecified amount of time).

Khrushchev&#x27;s dismissal led to the establishment of a more conservative Politburo; Kosygin, Nikolai Podgorny and Andrei Kirilenko were the most liberal members, Brezhnev and Arvīds Pelše belonged to the moderate faction while Mikhail Suslov retained his leadership of the party&#x27;s hardliners. Kosygin and Brezhnev strongly disagreed over economic policy; Kosygin wanted to increase investments in consumer goods and light industry whereas Brezhnev wanted to increase investment in heavy industry, agriculture and defence. In 1965, Kosygin introduced an economic reform, widely referred to as the &quot;Kosygin reform&quot;, which aimed to reform the planned economy within a socialist framework. In a bid to improve the Soviet economy Kosygin copied some of the measures used in the Western Bloc, such as profit making, which Brezhnev agreed to as the Soviet economy was entering a period of low growth. Kosygin&#x27;s reforms on agriculture gave considerable autonomy to the collective farms, giving them the right to the contents of private farming. As a result, during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1966–1970), large-scale land reclamation programmes, construction of irrigation channels, and other measures, were enacted. Overall, the reform failed and links to any high growth rates during the Eighth Five-Year Plan are considered to be &quot;tenuous&quot;.

The Brezhnev era, which had begun with high growth, began to stagnate some time in the early 1970s. Kosygin&#x27;s &quot;radical&quot; reform attempts were halted in 1971 and his second reform was more modest. The second reform was halted because of the 1973 oil crisis, when an international increase in the price of oil prompted economic growth based on selling oil. Another reform was implemented in 1979 but this, too, failed as by this time the Soviet economy had become &quot;addicted&quot; to high oil prices.

== Opposition ==

Acts of protest took place in reaction to the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia with protesters being dismissed from their jobs, beaten or arrested. Eight protesters held a demonstration in Red Square in Moscow and were subsequently imprisoned. A number of suspected dissidents had their homes and property searched and a group of Moscow lawyers specialised in defending people charged with anti-Soviet activity. Supporters of these meetings and demonstrations claimed that the arrests were illegal, because there is no criminality in the realization of the human right to obtain and distribute information. They asserted this right was part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the final act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (1975).

Throughout the Brezhnev Era, artists producing work in accordance with &quot;Soviet values&quot; within the framework of socialist realism constituted a well-paid, elite group that enjoyed an easy life and high social status. Nevertheless, open and clandestine political opposition to the authorities by some Soviet scientists and artists (collectively known as &quot;the dissidents&quot;) persisted from the Khrushchev Era. Prominent nuclear physicist Andrey Sakharov and Soviet Army General Pyotr Grigorenko were well-known representatives of this movement. When details of the Brezhnev government&#x27;s efforts to suppress the speech of political dissidents came to light via the glasnost policies of the Gorbachev Era, many writers claimed to have been unaware of its widespread use. Conversely, many members of the Soviet intelligentsia had systematically criticized the social and moral manifestations of the Stagnation without overtly challenging the authorities. Examples include writers Viktor Astafyev and Oles Honchar, playwright Grigory Gorin, and directors Eldar Ryazanov and Mark Zakharov.

<text>François Ponsard (1 June 1814 – 7 July 1867) was a French dramatist, poet and author and was a member of the Académie française.

==Biography==
Ponsard was born at Vienne, Isère in 1814 and trained as a lawyer. His first literary work was a translation of Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot; (1837). His play, &quot;Lucrèce&quot;, was first performed at the Thêatre Français on 1 April 1843. This date is notable in literature and dramatic history, because it marked a reaction against the romantic style of Alexandre Dumas, père and Victor Hugo. Ponsard adopted the liberty of the romantics with regard to the unities of time and place, but reverted to the more sober style of earlier French drama. The tastes and capacities of the greatest tragic actress of the day, &quot;Rachel&quot;, suited his methods, and this contributed greatly to his own popularity.
He followed up &quot;Lucrèce&quot; with &quot;Agnès de Méranie&quot; (1846), &quot;Charlotte Corday&quot; (1850), and others. Ponsard accepted the Second French Empire with no very great enthusiasm, and was given the post of librarian to the senate; he soon resigned, and fought a bloodless duel with a journalist on the subject. &quot;L&#x27;Honneur et l&#x27;argent&quot;, one of his most successful plays, was acted in 1853, and he became an Academician in 1855. For some years he was inactive, but in 1866 he repeated his earlier success with &quot;Le Lion amoureux&quot;, another play dealing with the revolutionary epoch.

His &quot;Galilée&quot;, which &quot;excited great opposition in the clerical camp&quot;, was produced early in 1867. The play was essentially a romance drawn very loosely from the life of Galileo Galilei, the great 17th-century Italian physicist and astronomer who was forced to recant his work by the Roman Inquisition. It was a &quot;hit with the public&quot;, but universally panned by critics as a &quot;trite drama of human emotions&quot;.

His &quot;Œuvres completes&quot; were published in Paris (3 vols., 1865–1876).

==Death==
Ponsard died in Paris in 1867, soon after his nomination to the commandership of the Legion of Honour.

==Place in French literature==
Most of Ponsard&#x27;s plays hold a certain steady level of literary and dramatic ability, but his popularity is in the main because his appearance coincided with a certain public weariness of the extravagant and unequal style of 1830.

==Awards and honours==
In 1845, Ponsard received the prize awarded by the Académie française for a tragedy &quot;to oppose a dike to the waves of romanticism.&quot;

In 1855 Ponsard became a member of the Académie française.
