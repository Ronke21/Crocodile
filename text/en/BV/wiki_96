<text>Edward Pierson Ramsay (3 December 1842 – 16 December 1916) was an Australian zoologist who specialised in ornithology.

==Early life==
Ramsay was born in Dobroyd Estate, Long Cove, Sydney, and educated at St Mark&#x27;s Collegiate School, The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta. He studied medicine from 1863 to 1865 at the University of Sydney but did not graduate.

==Career==
Although he never had had any formal scientific training in zoology, Ramsay had a keen interest in natural history and published many papers. In 1863 he was treasurer of the Entomological Society of New South Wales, he contributed a paper on the &quot;Oology of Australia&quot; to the Philosophical Society in July 1865, and when this society was merged into the Royal Society of New South Wales, he was made a life member in recognition of the work he had done for the Philosophical Society.

In 1868 Ramsay joined with his brothers in a sugar-growing plantation in Queensland which, however, was not successful. Ramsay was one of the foundation members of the Linnean Society of New South Wales when it was formed in 1874, and a member of its council from the beginning until 1892. He became the first Australian-born Curator of the Australian Museum, and built up a large variety of native weapons, dresses, utensils and ornaments illustrating the ethnology of Polynesia and Australia. From 1876 until 1894, when he had to resign due to his declining health, he published a &quot;Catalogue of the Australian Birds in the Australian Museum at Sydney&quot; in four parts.

In 1883 Ramsay traveled to London to attend the International Fisheries Exhibition. At that time he met Military Surgeon Francis Day who had collected fishes over several decades in India, Burma, Malaysia and other areas in southern Asia. Ramsay negotiated purchase a portion of Day&#x27;s collection, including about 150 of Day&#x27;s type specimens.

Presumably during the same trip to Britain he visited Edinburgh, as he was elected an Ordinary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (requiring his physical presence) in April 1884. His proposers were Sir John Murray, Sir William Turner, James Geikie and William Carmichael McIntosh.

==Late life==
After his resignation as Curator, Ramsay served the Australian Museum as &quot;consulting ornithologist&quot; until 1909. He died on 16 December 1916 because of carcinoma.

==Taxa described by him==
Among organisms Ramsay described are:
*northern death adder (&quot;Acanthophis praelongus&quot;) 
*the pig-nosed turtle (&quot;Carettochelys insculpta&quot;) 
*the giant bandicoot (&quot;Peroryctes broadbenti&quot;)
*the grey-headed robin (&quot;Heteromyias cinereifrons&quot;)
*The freshwater anchovy &quot;(Thryssa scratchleyi)&quot;
*Papuan king parrot (&quot;Alisterus chloropterus&quot;)

See :Category:Taxa named by Edward Pierson Ramsay.

== Taxa named in his honor ==
Ramsay is commemorated in the scientific names of two species of Australian snakes, &quot;Aspidites ramsayi&quot; and &quot;Austrelaps ramsayi&quot;.

The Spotted grubfish &quot;Parapercis ramsayi&quot; is believed to be named after him. 

Ramsayornis is a meliphagid genus which is named after him. It contains two species:
* Bar-breasted Honeyeater &quot;Ramsayornis fasciatus&quot; 
* Brown-backed Honeyeater &quot;Ramsayornis modestus&quot;

<doc id="632388" wikidata="Q683532" url="?curid=632388" title="Rafael Núñez">
<text>Rafael Wenceslao Núñez Moledo (September 28, 1825 – September 18, 1894) was a Colombian author, lawyer, journalist and politician, who was elected president of Colombia in 1880 and in 1884. Núñez was the leader of the so-called &quot;Regeneration&quot; process which produced the Colombian Constitution of 1886 which was to remain until 1991.

==Early life==
Núñez was the first of three children of cousins Dolores García Moledo and Colonel Francisco Núñez García, who were married on October 6, 1824. At 15, he was accepted by General Francisco Carmona in the rebel troops to fight in the War of the Supremes.

Little is known about the early years of Núñez, but he certainly served as a Circuit Judge in Chiriquí, Panama in 1848.
==Political career==
It is known that Núñez participated as a 15-year-old in the War of the Supremes (1840), the first of many Colombian civil wars, which was caused by the military uprising of a number of political leaders (the &quot;Supremes&quot;) in the provinces in the South of the country against the centralist and conservative government of José Ignacio de Márquez. Núñez joined the revolutionary side and participated in the siege to his own hometown, Cartagena. Following the war, he entered college and obtained a degree in Law from the Universidad del Magdalena e Istmo in 1844. By 1848 Núñez had founded in Cartagena, Colombia, the newspaper &quot;La Democracia&quot;, with the intention of promoting the presidential election of General José María Obando, the leader of the insurrection in the War of the Supremes, as a successor to José Hilario López. The same year, Obando had been elected as governor of the Province of Cartagena and he appointed Núñez as Chief of Staff in Cartagena&#x27;s government, thus beginning his political life. He would maintain the position until 1853, with Obando as president, when he decided to move to Bogotá to become a member of the Colombian Congress, and where he made a name for himself by fighting the federalist and socialist ideas of Manuel Murillo Toro. Following the coup against Obando in 1854 by José María Melo, Núñez went into hiding, but then was elected as governor of the department of Bolívar, which contributed to the defeat of Melo. The newly appointed president Manuel María Mallarino made Núñez, minister (secretary) of War in 1855, and then Minister of the Treasury. His excellent results as Minister of Treasury would bring him wide recognition. In 1855, he also published his first volume of political essays, under the name of &quot;La Federación&quot;.

Later, under the government of Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, he served as Minister of the Treasury. After participating briefly in the Convention of Ríonegro which would produce the Constitution of Rionegro as a representative of the state of Panama, he decided to leave the country in 1863. He first lived in New York City for two years, writing for a number of newspapers both in Colombia and in Spain. Then, he was appointed consul of the United States of Colombia in Le Havre by president Murillo Toro, and later, he was appointed as the Colombian Consul in Liverpool.

He returned to Colombia in 1876 at the center of a political fight. He had been nominated as a candidate for the presidency that year but did not win the election. He was elected as a senator for the State of Bolívar, however. From 1878 to 1888, he wrote hundreds of influential articles related to the constitutional reform for the newspapers &quot;La Luz&quot; and &quot;La Nación&quot; of Bogota, and &#x27;El Porvenir&#x27; and &quot;El Impulso&quot; of Cartagena. He also wrote the lyrics for the Colombian national anthem.

He was elected President of Colombia for the 1880–1882 presidential term. Again, in 1884, he was re-elected President of Colombia with the support of the Conservative Party, promoting a movement that he called the &quot;Regeneration&quot;.

=== Third presidential term and the Constitution of 1886 ===
He was the force behind &quot;La Regeneración&quot; (Regeneration) movement of 1884 and the new Constitution for Colombia of 1886. The Regeneration program advanced by Núñez opposed most liberal reforms established in the Constitution of Rionegro, and its victory changed the country from a decentralized federal system to a centralized system with a strong central presidency. Opposing the conservative and centralist tendencies in Núñez proposal, liberal leaders issued yet another civil war in 1884 and 1885. The conservative forces in favor of president Núñez finally surrendered the liberal troops in 1885, which led to Núñez&#x27; famous proclamation: &quot;Sirs, the Constitution of 1863 is no more.&quot; Following this military victory, on September 10, 1885, Núñez summoned two representatives from each of the sovereign states to initiate the Constituent Assembly, which was installed on November 11 of the same year.

The constitutional reform of 1886, carried out with the collaboration of Miguel Antonio Caro, was possibly the most outstanding political feat of Núñez. This Colombian Constitution of 1886, with some later modifications, was in effect until the proclamation of a new one in 1991, and in addition to reestablishing a strong Centralist form of government, changing the name of the country from the United States of Colombia to that of Republic of Colombia, it also reestablished the links with the Vatican, and made Catholicism the official religion, leaving education in the hands of the Catholic church. The Constitution also changed the duration of presidential terms from two to six years, left the election of the president of the Republic to the Congress, and changed the old states into Departments which would be ruled by a governor appointed by the president of the Republic, hence giving a lot of power to the president.

He was again re-elected to be President of Colombia in 1886 and in 1892 but did not take office for his last term. He had moved back to Cartagena by then as his health deteriorated. Rather, his vice-president, Miguel Antonio Caro was sworn in as the de facto president for the presidential term of 1892-1898. While his contact with the central government was thus only indirect, Núñez remained an important political figure, and his letters and columns and essays were very influential. Moreover, many political figures of the time went to visit him constantly in Cartagena. His health continued worsening and he finally died on September 18, 1894, following a fever that left him in bed and speechless for a couple of days. Núñez died being officially appointed as president.


==Legacy==
In his first administration, Núñez restored peace and order, which brought him wide popularity. He allowed the Catholic bishops, who were in exile, to return to the country. He created the Military Academy and the National Academy of Music. He inaugurated the international telegraph service. He re-established diplomatic relationships with Spain, which had been severed since the War of Independence. Also, he signed international treaties of commerce and cultural exchange with France and the United Kingdom.

During his second administration, Núñez sponsored, championed and enacted a major and fundamental overhaul of the nation&#x27;s political structure, which ended with the adoption and enactment of the new Constitution of the Republic of Colombia, which came to be known as the Colombian Constitution of 1886.

==Literature==

In 1874, while in Europe, he had many of his most important writings published.

Núñez was the author of the words to the national anthem of Colombia, ¡Oh Gloria Inmarcesible!.

Núñez is mentioned in Gabriel García Márquez&#x27;s 1985 novel, &quot;Love in the Time of Cholera&quot; (Amor en los tiempos del cólera).

<doc id="632389" wikidata="Q5467737" url="?curid=632389" title="Ford Essex V4 engine">
<text>The Essex V4 is a V4 petrol engine manufactured by the Ford Motor Company from 1965 to 1977. The engine was available in both 1.7 L and 2.0 L capacities. Designed by Ford of Britain, the Essex V4 was produced at a plant in Dagenham, originally in the county of Essex, later part of east London. The engine was used in the Ford Corsair, Capri Mk I, Consul/Granada Mk I, Ford Zephyr Mk IV and the Ford Transit Mk I van.

==History==
Development of the Essex engine family began in 1961. While design of the new engine would be handled by engine design director Alan Worters and a team consisting of Alan Aitken, John Pask, and George Soule, a product planning team would also be involved. The first product strategy meeting was chaired by Ford product planning manager Terence Beckett. Philip Ives was manager of a new engine and transmissions planning department.

The project&#x27;s goal was to produce an engine suitable for use in both passenger cars and work vans, with marine and industrial applications also under consideration. Right from the outset both high- and low-compression petrol versions were planned, as was a diesel version. For the van application, the product planners examined the features of the market-leading Volkswagen Transporter. While Ford would not duplicate the Volkswagen&#x27;s rear-engined drivetrain, the advantages of its flat floor and unimpeded driver access led to the team proposing a vehicle with a V4 engine mounted ahead of the driver to free up cargo space. In the end both a V4 and V6 engine were approved, sharing a 60° included angle between the cylinder banks and an oversquare bore and stroke ratio. The resulting Essex V4 and Essex V6 engines share the same combustion chamber design and some internal dimensions and have many parts in common, including pistons, valves, and spark plugs.

While work was progressing in England on the van to be called the V-series, Ford of Germany was proceeding with a design for a new commercial van of their own to be called the Transit. Ford in Germany already had a V4 engine in production; the American-designed Ford Taunus V4 engine, and it was this engine that they proposed to use in their new vehicle. Both van projects were presented to management, who was already moving to consolidate both product lines and corporate divisions in Europe and Britain. The decision was made to approve a single body and chassis but allow England and Germany to use their own engines. The V-series name was also dropped in favour of the Transit name in England.

A £14 million investment in renovations to the Dagenham plant where the new engines would be produced was funded. The Essex V4 first appeared in 1965 in both the Ford Transit Mk1 van and the Ford Corsair saloon.

==Technical details==
The Essex V4 is a 60° V4 engine with a cast iron cylinder block and heads. The engine block was just long. The engine uses crossflow cylinder heads with 2 overhead valves per cylinder operated through pushrods and rocker arms by a single camshaft in the block. Inlet valves had a diameter of , while exhaust valves were .

All Essex V4s had the same bore diameter, but the 1.7 L version had a stroke length of and the 2.0 L version had a stroke length of . Connecting rod lengths were the same, so the different displacements were achieved by changing the crankshaft throw lengths and the piston heights. The cylinder firing order was 1-3-2-4.

The 1.7 L and 2.0 L engines in the Transit van had a standard compression ratio of 7.7:1. A ratio of 9.1:1 was standard for 1.7 L engines in passenger cars, while 8.9:1 was standard for 2.0 L engines in passenger cars and was optional for the 2.0 L in the Transit. Power output varied from for the low-compression 1.7 L engine to for the high-compression 2.0 L engine, while torque ranged from to . With the Essex V4 engine&#x27;s Heron cylinder head design and bowl-in-crown pistons, different compression ratios were achieved with different cylinder heads. Low-compression cylinder heads such as the ones fitted to Ford Transits had shallow combustion chambers in them while high-compression heads were completely flat.

To counteract the engine vibration inherent in a 60° V4, Ford added a balance shaft to the Essex V4. In the related Essex V6 these vibrations were less pronounced, so the V6 did not have a balance shaft. Even with the balance shaft, and notwithstanding Ford&#x27;s promoting the V4-equipped Corsair as &quot;The car that is seen and not heard&quot;, reviewers of V4-powered cars frequently commented on the engine&#x27;s lack of smoothness.

For the 1967 release of the Corsair 2000E the 2.0 L engine received larger ports, a new camshaft, and a 2-bbl Weber 32DIF carburettor on a new intake manifold in place of the earlier 1-bbl Zenith Stromberg. These changes brought horsepower to at 5000 rpm, up from . A revised clutch and flywheel were fitted in July 1968, and in October of the same year the oil pump was redesigned.

Between 1971 and 1972 the Essex V4 (and V6) engines were upgraded again. Power output increased by using a different camshaft, changing the shape of the inlet ports from an O shape to a D shape and increasing the compression ratio slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1. Other changes included moving the oil dipstick from the front to the left side of the engine, and making the camshaft drive gear out of steel with fibre teeth.

The change to the camshaft drive gear was made to address a weakness in the engine. This timing gear was originally a fibre composite part that could break at high rpm or with age. Since the engine was an interference type, a failed timing gear made it possible for the pistons to contact any valves left open and do significant damage. Another weakness was in the oil pump drive. The camshaft drove the distributor (Ford or Lucas) through a skew gear, which in turn drove a hexagonal shaft that powered the oil pump. If the hex shaft rounded off it would no longer engage with the distributor drive and the oil pump would stop, starving the engine of oil.

Other problems experienced with early engines included leaking head gaskets, worn balance shaft bearings, and big-end or main bearing failures.

==Applications==
Released in 1965, the MK1 Transit with its flat front and short bonnet was designed for the Essex V4. Both 1.7 L and 2.0 L versions were available at the outset. The planned diesel version of the Essex did not reach production, so a Perkins inline-4 diesel engine was made available in Mk1 Transits, which required a longer &quot;Bullnose&quot; bonnet to clear the longer engine.

Also debuting in 1965, the Ford Corsair offered both the 1.7 L and 2.0 L versions of the engine. Coachbuilder Crayford Engineering produced their own Ford Corsair V4 GT Crayford Convertible with the 2.0 L V4 from 1966 to 1968. A V4-powered estate conversion was built by coachbuilder Abbott. A revised Essex V4 with a 2-bbl carburettor was fitted in the 2000E version of the Corsair. The most powerful factory version of the Essex V4 appeared in the Ford Corsair 2000E Deluxe and produced .

The revised Zephyr Mk IV line debuted in 1966. The Zephyr 4 model was powered by the 2.0 L Essex. The model remained in production until 1972.

In 1969 the Capri 2000GT mounted a 2.0 L Essex V4 producing at 5500 rpm and of torque at 3600 rpm. When the Capri II was released in 1974, the 2.0 L Essex V4 was replaced by either the 2.0 L OHC Pinto TL20 inline-4 or the 2.0 L Ford Cologne V6 engine.

The Mk1 Granada, released in March 1972 as the Corsair&#x27;s replacement, was also available with the 2.0 L Essex V4. The Granada-based Ford Consul offered either the 1.7 L or 2.0 L displacements from 1972 to 1974.

The Essex V4 was used by Marcos sports cars in their Marcos 2 litre model. Released in 1969, this version remained in production until 1971; the company went into receivership one year later. When the Marcos GT was revived in component form in 1982 the Essex V4 was included in the list of supported engines. Total production of V4 Marcos cars is usually estimated to have been 78 units, although some references report as few as just 40 cars.

===Essex V4 UK production history===
===South Africa===
The 2.0 L Essex V4 was also built in South Africa, where it was originally fitted to the Corsair. Due to local content laws, the South African motor had a more varied usage, uniquely being fitted to the Cortina TC and to the 17M (Taunus P7), as well as to the Capri. By the early seventies, a more refined version of the engine produced SAE, or net — similar to the DIN rating.

<doc id="632392" wikidata="Q2263757" url="?curid=632392" title="Liner notes">
<text>Liner notes (also sleeve notes or album notes) are the writings found on the sleeves of LP record albums and in booklets that come inserted into the compact disc jewel case or cassette j-cards.

==Origin==
Liner notes are descended from the program notes for musical concerts, and developed into notes that were printed on the outer album jacket or the inner sleeve used to protect a traditional 12-inch vinyl record, i.e., long playing or gramophone record album. The term descends from the name &quot;record liner&quot; or &quot;album liner&quot;. Album liner notes survived format changes from vinyl LP to cassette to CD. These notes can be sources of information about the contents of the recording as well as broader cultural topics.

==Contents==

===Common material===
Such notes often contained a mix of factual and anecdotal material, and occasionally a discography for the artist or the issuing record label. Liner notes were also an occasion for thoughtful signed essays on the artist by another party, often a sympathetic music journalist, a custom that has largely died out. However, the liner note &quot;essay&quot; has survived in reissues and retrospective compilations, particularly in box sets. It is also a tradition in Japan, especially for foreign artist releases. Liner notes often include complete song lyrics for the album.

===Biographies===
Liner notes now usually include information about the musician, lyrics, a personnel list, and other credits to people the musicians want to thank and people or companies involved in the production of the music. They also can give details on the extent of each musical piece, and sometimes place them in historical or social context. Liner notes for classical music recordings often provide information in several languages; if the piece includes vocal parts, they will often include a libretto, possibly also translated into several languages.

=== Label Copy ===
The factual information in liner notes comes from the Label Copy. Label Copy is the record label&#x27;s official info sheet for the published release. It contains information that accompanies a musical work, including artist name, song title, song length, ISRC code, catalogue number, composer, publisher, rights holder, technical and artistic credits, A&amp;R and producer credits, recording dates and locations. In digital music, the label copy is contained within what&#x27;s known as metadata.

=== Metadata ===
Liner notes sometimes provide metadata that can help when cataloguing private or public collections of sound recordings. However, the information provided on liner notes varies considerably depending on the studio or label which produced the record. It also varies how much of the metadata digital media services such as Spotify and iTunes make public. In 2018, Tidal launched official music credits supplied by distributors across their database of 90 million recordings. In 2019 Australian company Jaxsta launched a database of official music credits and liner notes. The database is made up of content-owner supplied metadata rather than crowd-sourced data, making previous hidden metadata more widely available to the music industry as well as the public domain. In 2019, French company Qobuz launched official music credits and digital liner notes booklets appearing in the player. Pandora also launched full credits within their player in 2019. Metadata credits are sent from official sources to all databases and streaming services using the DDEX ERN standard, however not all services display this data to the consumer.

==Digital liner notes==
Increasingly and due to the rise of digital downloads, a digital booklet is being introduced to compensate for the lack of a physical booklet. Apple Inc. also introduced iTunes LP which features interactive menus instead of simple pages. Spotify also has songwriter and producer credits available for individual tracks. Lyrics are also available on certain tracks, in collaboration with Genius. , it was estimated that up to 94% of recordings are now supplying the official music credits feed direct from the owners of the data to streaming services such as Spotify, Amazon, Google, Tidal, Pandora, Qobuz and more, as well as databases such as Gracenote, but not all services are displaying the data they are sent at this stage.

==Awards==
A Grammy Award for Best Album Notes has been given annually since the 6th Annual Grammy Awards, May 12, 1964.

<doc id="632394" wikidata="Q247899" url="?curid=632394" title="Transit of Mercury">
<text>A transit of Mercury across the Sun takes place when the planet Mercury passes directly between the Sun and a superior planet. During a transit, Mercury appears as a tiny black dot moving across the Sun as the planet obscures a small portion of the solar disk. Because of orbital alignments, transits viewed from Earth occur in May or November. The last four such transits occurred on May 7, 2003; November 8, 2006; May 9, 2016; and November 11, 2019. The next will occur on November 13, 2032. A typical transit lasts several hours. Mercury transits are much more frequent than transits of Venus, with about 13 or 14 per century, primarily because Mercury is closer to the Sun and orbits it more rapidly.

On June 3, 2014, the Mars rover &quot;Curiosity&quot; observed the planet Mercury transiting the Sun, marking the first time a planetary transit has been observed from a celestial body besides Earth.

== Scientific investigation ==

The orbit of the planet Mercury lies interior to that of the Earth, and thus it can come into an inferior conjunction with the Sun. When Mercury is near the node of its orbit, it passes through the orbital plane of the Earth. If an inferior conjunction occurs as Mercury is passing through its orbital node, the planet can be seen to pass across the disk of the Sun in an event called a transit. Depending on the chord of the transit and the position of the planet Mercury in its orbit, the maximum length of this event is 7h 50m.

Transit events are useful for studying the planet and its orbit. Examples of the scientific investigations based on transits of Mercury are:
* Measuring the scale of the Solar System.
*Investigations of the variability of the Earth&#x27;s rotation and of the tidal acceleration of the Moon.
* Measuring the mass of Venus from secular variations in Mercury&#x27;s orbit.
* Looking for long term variations in the solar radius.
* Investigating the black drop effect, including calling into question the purported discovery of the atmosphere of Venus during the 1761 transit.
* Assessing the likely drop in light level in an exoplanet transit.

=== Occurrence ===

Transits of Mercury can only occur when the Earth is aligned with a node of Mercury&#x27;s orbit. Currently that alignment occurs within a few days of May 8 (descending node) and November 10 (ascending node), with the angular diameter of Mercury being about 12″ for May transits, and 10″ for November transits. The average date for a transit increases over centuries as a result of Mercury&#x27;s nodal precession and Earth&#x27;s axial precession.

Transits of Mercury occur on a regular basis. As explained in 1882 by Newcomb, the interval between passages of Mercury through the ascending node of its orbit is 87.969 days, and the interval between the Earth&#x27;s passage through that same longitude is 365.254 days. Using continued fraction approximations of the ratio of these values, it can be shown that Mercury will make an almost integral number of revolutions about the Sun over intervals of 6, 7, 13, 33, 46, and 217 years.

In 1894 Crommelin noted that at these intervals, the successive paths of Mercury relative to the Sun are consistently displaced northwards or southwards. He noted the displacements as:

Comparing these displacements with the solar diameter (about 31.7′ in May, and 32.4′ in November) the following may be deduced about the interval between transits:

* For May transits, intervals of 6 and 7 years are not possible. For November transits, an interval of 6 years is possible but rare (the last such pair was 1993 and 1999, with both transits being very close to the solar limb), while an interval of 7 years is to be expected.
* An interval of 13 years is to be expected for both May and November transits.
* An interval of 20 years is possible but rare for a May transit, but is to be expected for November transits.
* An interval of 33 years is to be expected for both May and November transits.
* A transit having a similar path across the sun will occur 46 (and 171) years later – for both November and May transits.
* A transit having an almost identical path across the Sun will occur 217 years later – for both November and May transits.

Transits that occur 46 years apart can be grouped into a series. For November transits each series includes about 20 transits over 874 years, with the path of Mercury across the Sun passing further north than for the previous transit. For May transits each series includes about 10 transits over 414 years, with the path of Mercury across the Sun passing further south than for the previous transit. Some authors have allocated a series number to transits on the basis of this 46-year grouping.

Similarly transits that occur 217 years apart can be grouped into a series. For November transits each series would include about 135 transits over 30,000 years. For May transits each series would include about 110 transits over 24,000 years. For both the May and November series, the path of Mercury across the Sun passes further north than for the previous transit. Series numbers have not been traditionally allocated on the basis of the 217 year grouping.

Predictions of transits of Mercury covering many years are available at NASA, SOLEX, and Fourmilab.

=== Observation ===

At inferior conjunction, the planet Mercury subtends an angle of , which, during a transit, is too small to be seen without a telescope. A common observation made at a transit is recording the times when the disk of Mercury appears to be in contact with the limb of the Sun. Those contacts are traditionally referred to as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th contacts – with the 2nd and 3rd contacts occurring when the disk of Mercury is fully on the disk of the sun. As a general rule, 1st and 4th contacts cannot be accurately detected, while 2nd and 3rd contacts are readily visible within the constraints of the Black Drop effect, irradiation, atmospheric conditions, and the quality of the optics being used.

Observed contact times for transits between 1677 and 1881 are given in S Newcomb&#x27;s analysis of transits of Mercury. Observed 2nd and 3rd contacts times for transits between 1677 and 1973 are given in Royal Greenwich Observatory Bulletin No.181, 359-420 (1975).

=== Partial ===

Sometimes Mercury appears to only graze the Sun during a transit. There are two possible scenarios:

* Firstly, it is possible for a transit to occur such that, at mid-transit, the disk of Mercury has fully entered the disk of the Sun as seen from some parts of the world, while as seen from other parts of the world the disk of Mercury has only partially entered the disk of the Sun. The transit of November 15, 1999 was such a transit, with the transit being a full transit for most of the world, but only a partial transit for Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. The previous such transit was on October 28, 743 and the next will be on May 11, 2391. While these events are very rare, two such transits will occur within years in December 6149 and June 6152.
* Secondly, it is possible for a transit to occur in which, at mid-transit, the disk of Mercury has partially entered the disk of the Sun as seen from some parts of the world, while as seen from other parts of the world Mercury completely misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on May 11, 1937, when a partial transit occurred in southern Africa and southern Asia and no transit was visible from Europe and northern Asia. The previous such transit was on October 21, 1342 and the next will be on May 13, 2608.

The possibility that, at mid-transit, Mercury is seen to be fully on the solar disk from some parts of the world, and completely miss the Sun as seen from other parts of the world cannot occur.

== History ==
The first observation of a Mercury transit was observed on November 7, 1631 by Pierre Gassendi. He was surprised by the small size of the planet compared to the Sun. Johannes Kepler had predicted the occurrence of transits of Mercury and Venus in his ephemerides published in 1630.

Images of the November 15, 1999 transit from the Transition Region and Coronal explorer (TRACE) satellite were on Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) on November 19. Three APODs featured the May 9, 2016 transit.

=== 1832 event ===
The Shuckburgh telescope of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in London was used for the 1832 Mercury transit. It was equipped with a micrometer by Dollond and was used for a report of the events as seen through the small refractor. By observing the transit in combination with timing it and taking measures, a diameter for the planet was taken. They also reported the peculiar effects that they compared to pressing a coin into the Sun. The observer remarked:

=== 1907 event ===
For the 1907 Mercury transit, telescopes used at the Paris Observatory included:

* Foucault-Eichens reflector ( aperture)
* Foucault-Eichens reflector ( aperture)
* Martin-Eichens reflector ( aperture)
* Several small refractors

The telescopes were mobile and were placed on the terrace for the several observations.

<text>Optical disc packaging is the packaging that accompanies CDs, DVDs, and other formats of optical discs. Most packaging is rigid or semi-rigid and designed to protect the media from scratches and other types of exposure damage.

==Jewel case==
A jewel case is a compact disc case that has been used since the compact disc was first released in 1982. It is a three-piece plastic case, measuring , a volume of , which usually contains a compact disc along with the liner notes and a back card. Two opposing transparent halves are hinged together to form the casing, the back half holding a media tray that grips the disc by its hole. All three parts are made of injection-moulded polystyrene.

Around 1993, there was a general shift to the rear jewel case being made of clear plastic instead of black or coloured.

The front lid contains two, four, or six tabs to keep any liner notes in place. The liner notes typically will be a booklet, or a single leaf folded in half. In addition, there is usually a back card, , underneath the media tray and visible through the clear back, often listing the track names, studio, copyright data and other information. The back card is folded into a flattened &quot;U&quot; shape, with the sides being visible along the ends (often referred to as the spine) of the case. The ends usually have the name of the release and the artist, and often label or catalogue information printed on them, and are designed to be visible when the case is stored vertically, &#x27;book-style&#x27;, on shelves.

The rear media tray snaps into the back cover and is responsible for securing the CD. This is achieved by a central circular hub of spring-loaded teeth that grip and effectively suspend the disc above the tray surface, preventing the recording surface from being scratched.

The jewel case is the standard case used by the majority of manufacturers and it is the most common type of case found in record and movie stores. Jewel cases are occasionally used for DVDs, but generally not for those that contain major film releases. Blank Blu-ray media is also most commonly sold in standard-width jewel cases.

===Origin===
According to Philips, the name &quot;jewel case&quot; reflects either the generally high quality of the case design compared to initial attempts, or its appearance. According to one publication, initial attempts at packaging CDs were unsatisfactory. When the new design, by Peter Doodson, was found to be &quot;virtually perfect&quot; it was dubbed the &quot;jewel case&quot;. Another publication quotes Doodson describing that he &quot;specified polished ribs as they pick up the light and shine&quot; and states that the resulting appearance led to the name.

===Strengths===

The CD jewel case has a tight and firm grip of the CD because of the tray&#x27;s &quot;teeth&quot; or &quot;lock&quot;. Because of this, even if the CD jewel case is turned upside-down, left, or right, the CD is held in place. Flimsier cases may cause the CD to become loose, or even fall out. Also, since the jewel case is made of plastic, it is sturdier compared to cardboard, paper, or foams. When pressure is applied to the CD jewel case, the case will break first before the CD. If the case is made of thin cardboard, there is a greater chance that the CD would break or get damaged because the weight is directed onto it.

The type of material of the CD jewel case allows storage of CDs for decades without ruining the CDs. The same is not as true with other cases, since paper can stick to the CDs due to air, humidity, and other factors. The CD jewel case may also be preferred because it offers orderliness on a shelf. Since the CD jewel case has existed for decades, there are many CD shelves, racks, and other products in the market that are made for CD jewel cases.

The CD jewel case is designed to carry a booklet, as well as to have panel inserts. These may be used to display album artwork, lyrics, photos, thank-yous, messages, biography, etc.

Because the CD jewel case is the standard, most commonly used CD case, it is much cheaper. The price of the CD jewel case usually ranges from $0.75 to $0.95. That is a few cents cheaper than digipaks and other CD wallets. However, if large quantities of cases are needed, the price difference may be hundreds or thousands of US dollars.

===Weaknesses===
There are a number of shortcomings with the jewel case. The case is hinged on two brittle plastic arms, which often break if the case receives shock or stress due to being dropped. The teeth of the hub holding the disc are also prone to failure by snapping. There is a problem with the tabs (&quot;half-moons&quot;) which hold the liner notes in place; sometimes, especially with larger booklets, the tabs grip the booklet too tightly, leading to tearing. When replacing the booklet, it can get snagged and crumple or rip. As noted above, some CD releases have only two tabs, which allows the booklet to be more easily removed and replaced (with the disadvantage of the booklet sometimes falling out if held the wrong way). Replacement jewel cases can be purchased, to replace those that have broken plastic arms or hub teeth.

===Variations===

Double disc albums can either be packaged in standard-thickness jewel cases with hinged media trays which can be lifted to reveal the second disc (trays hinged on the left are known as &quot;Smart Tray&quot; format; those hinged on the right are known as &quot;Brilliant Box&quot; format) or in a chubby jewel case, sometimes called a multi-CD jewel case, which is slightly thicker than two normal jewel cases stacked on top of each other and can hold from 2 and up to 6 CDs. Chubby jewel cases do not fit in some CD racks, however, some racks have a few extra wide slots specifically to accommodate them.

Jewel cases for CDs released early in the format&#x27;s life featured frosted top and bottom spines as opposed to the ridged ones more commonly used. As a result of their rarity, these types of jewel cases are fairly coveted among collectors.

&quot;Super Jewel Box&quot; is a more advanced design that offers amongst other improvements a greatly strengthened hinge area. The depth of the disc tray is also greater, allowing for two discs to be placed on top of each other. The super jewel box cannot be used as a direct replacement for the older jewel case design as its card insert for the back is slightly different in size and shape. The super jewel box was developed by Philips and it was intended to be the successor to the original jewel case. Some CD manufacturers (for example the high-end company Linn) are supplying them. The super jewel box is the conventional case for Super Audio CD (SACD) releases; a taller &quot;Plus&quot; size, midway between CD and DVD-Video size, is the conventional case for DVD-Audio, and as of mid-2006, the case format for all albums released by the Universal Music Group in Europe.

Many alternatives to the standard jewel case may also be found, including larger DVD-style cases with a more book-like shape. It is not uncommon to find CDs housed in custom cases, tins and boxes of varying shapes and sizes. Slipcases and other envelope-type designs are also occasionally used.

Some DualDiscs are packaged in jewel cases of a somewhat different design from the CD version; the inside edge is rounded instead of flat, and the physical position of the disc is moved slightly toward the spine to make room for a latch mechanism. The overall dimensions of a DualDisc case are roughly the same as a standard CD case. However, the hinge mechanism is smaller and cannot be dismantled as easily as on a standard jewel case.

Smaller jewel cases are used for 8 cm CD and DVD media; similar cases without the hub are used for MiniDisc and (magnetic) Zip drive media.

Additionally, larger jewel cases that were around the size of VHS keep cases were used for North American releases of games for the Sega CD, all North American releases of Sega Saturn games, and games released early in the original PlayStation&#x27;s life cycle. Because the larger thickness of these cases put the CDs inside at greater risk of being accidentally knocked out of their hubs, large foam bricks were placed on top of the discs when packaged to hold them in place.

===Slimline jewel case===
Slimline jewel cases first became popular for CD singles sold in Japan and Europe, and have become a common space-saving packaging for burned CDs. The cases used for CD singles sold in Japan and Europe are 7 mm thick, with a &quot;J-card&quot; type inlay, showing cover art through the front of the case, and also through both the spine and part of the back of the case. The CD itself is usually inserted upside down in the case so that the artwork on the disc itself shows through the transparent back of the case.

Most slim jewel cases sold for burned CDs use the measure , which is roughly half the thickness of a standard CD jewel case, allowing twice as many CDs to be stored in the same space, and will generally fit two to a slot in a standard CD rack. They generally do not have room for a full package insert booklet, only a slip of paper for a track listing or cover art, showing only through the front of the case. Unlike the standard jewel cases, slimline cases are made of two pieces rather than three and do not have a place for a back label. However, with this design the &quot;spine&quot; is narrower, making the discs more difficult to identify when stored on edge on a shelf.

==External marketing packaging==
In the U.S. and Canada, the jewel box of a music CD was originally packaged for retail sale in a large cardboard box called a longbox in order to fit in store fixtures designed for vinyl records, offer larger space for display of artwork and marketing blurbs, and deter shoplifting. This packaging was much-criticized as environmentally wasteful and was eventually dropped by most retailers in the mid-1990s.

Around 1994, the top wrap-around label sticker began to appear on most CDs, to make it easier to read what each CD was from the top without having to flip through them to see the front cover. These stickers were usually nothing more than informational labels and rarely would have any use in the marketing of the album. The wrap-around sticker also provided an extra seal, possibly as another theft deterrent.

A chiefly Japanese packaging addition is the inclusion of an obi strip, a J-card–esque paperboard slip wound around the left side of the case to show details such as the price, artist, etc.

==Paper or Tyvek sleeve==
The simplest, least expensive package is a paper envelope. More expensive versions add a transparent window to the envelope allowing the disc label to be seen. The envelope can also be made out of spun-bonded polyethylene (trade-named Tyvek) which is stronger and lighter than paper and is resistant to moisture.

==Q Pack==
The Q Pack was developed by the Queens Group Inc. in the mid-1990s as an alternative to regular CD jewel cases. (The Queens Group was purchased by Shorewood Packaging, who are part of International Paper). The Q Pack does not have a snap-in tray like a regular jewel case. It is characterized by the corrugated raised area where the top hinges to the back. Since Q Pack cases are not transparent, generally cover art is applied as a decal to the cover. Decals can also be applied to the inside front, on the tray underneath the hub and the back cover. A slot for an insert booklet is found inside the front cover as on typical jewel cases.

==Digipak ==
A &quot;digipak&quot; or &quot;digipack&quot; (generic term) is a rectangular cardboard package with one or more plastic trays capable of holding a disc attached to the inside. There are variations where the disc(s) sit on a hub or spindle inside and come in various sizes. A digipak-style case is a common alternative to the jewel case. The term &quot;digipak&quot; was once a trademarked name but is no longer active as of March 2020 according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

==FLPpak==
Similar in concept to Digipak, an FLPpak consists of a wrap-around outer shell made of cardboard, bonded to a plastic CD tray. However, FLPpak differs in two significant ways:

First, while Digipak cases extend their cardboard shells taller than their trays to keep the tray as hidden as possible when closed, FLPpak packages extend their trays beyond the cardboard and incorporate top and bottom edges, sacrificing aesthetic flexibility for increased protection from shelf wear. (These end-caps are extended far enough that, when laying on a flat surface, the plastic top and bottom edges will suspend the front or back above it.)

Second, by incorporating a latching closure into the right edge of the tray, avoiding the need for an extra component such as a slip cover to keep the package from coming open.

Though now expired, the design was originally covered by and , held by the Ivy Hill Corporation. These numbers can be found moulded into the inner surface of the closure.

Packages of this type which were manufactured by Ivy Hill can also be identified by the FLP logo moulded into the bottom-left and top-right corners of the disc tray. This logo was covered by U.S. trademark number 74419766, cancelled as of August 13, 2005.

==Digisleeve==

A digisleeve consists of a rectangular cardboard package which differs from a digipak in that it does not have a tray, spindle or hub and the disc or discs slide into an outside pocket of the packaging.

==Digifile==
A digifile consists of a rectangular cardboard package that is similar to a digisleeve except that the disc or discs slide vertically (and in some cases diagonally) into a horizontal or diagonal slot inside the packaging.

==Wallet==
A wallet consists of a rectangular cardboard package that is similar to a digisleeve except that the disc or discs slide horizontally into a vertical slot inside the packaging.

==Digibook/mediabook==
A digibook/mediabook is a type of packaging that has a hard cover (like a hardbound book) and comes in various sizes. The disc can either slide into the package or sit on a spindle, hub or tray inside.

==Artbook/earbook==
An artbook/earbook is a type of packaging that has a hard cover (like a hardbound book) and is typically (but not always) around 11 1/4&quot; to 11 1/2&quot; square and contains a several-page booklet inside. Basically, it&#x27;s an oversized deluxe digibook/mediabook.

==Mini LP sleeve/paper sleeve==
A mini LP sleeve/paper sleeve is a square cardboard package that looks like a miniaturized version of an LP jacket. The disc usually slides into an inner sleeve whose opening need not match the outer sleeve in the manner of actual LPs. Mini LP sleeves can either appear as single sleeves or gatefolds, identically to full-sized LP jackets, with both variants being used for a number of music releases.

While used in a somewhat limited capacity in the west, where the jewel case remains the most popular form of CD packaging, mini LP sleeves are common for reissues of older albums in Japan, with their typically high level of faithfulness to the original vinyl record packaging making them sought-after among collectors.

The downside to this format is that the disc can be easily scratched each time it is taken out for play; a more serious issue can also be that if the glue that keeps the sleeve that holds the CD closed on the side closest to the spine (on gatefold covers) weakens, it can get onto the CD, rendering it unplayable. For these reasons, mini LP releases—particularly Japanese ones—enclose the CD in a protective sleeve made from matted plastic or rice paper. Another disadvantage with mini LP sleeves is that, like digipaks, they are significantly more vulnerable to wear and other forms of damage compared to standard jewel cases and are more difficult to replace.

One advantage of mini LP sleeves is that album covers that were originally textured, such as &quot;Back in Black&quot; by AC/DC or &quot;Fear of Music&quot; by Talking Heads, can retain the texturing on the CD release, as well as being able to replicate other nuances of the vinyl packaging such as unusually shaped packaging or artwork intended to span the whole of a gatefold (e.g. &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; and &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, respectively, by Pink Floyd). In addition, the packaging is more environmentally friendly due to the use of more easily recyclable and biodegradable cardboard (as opposed to the polystyrene used in jewel cases) and is significantly cheaper to produce than both jewel cases and digipaks, which has made them a more favorable option in markets where CD sales are declining.

==Minipack==
A minipack is a square cardboard package in which the disc sits on a spindle, hub or tray. In essence, it&#x27;s a combination of a digipak and mini LP sleeve. This type of packaging is usually hand-made and is not seen very often.

==JakeBox==
JakeBox is a paperboard packaging concept designed in Sweden, featuring a pop-up &quot;claw&quot;. The claw releases the CD when the cover is opened and locks it again when the cover is closed. This design makes the disc easily accessible and protects the CD once the case is closed.

==Discbox slider==
The discbox slider (also called DBS) is a disc packaging concept in 100% carton board, found both in CD and DVD-sized packaging formats. The DBS is comparable with plastic jewel or amaray cases when it comes to size but holds more of the features of the LP style cases in terms of light weight and printability. The DBS case opens up from the side by moving the slider part (on which the disc is resting) from the sleeve. The discbox slider is 100% recyclable. Many covermount CDs released in British magazine &quot;Mixmag&quot; used to be packaged in a discbox slider, after replacing a standard jewel box, although the discbox slider itself was replaced by a simple cardboard sleeve.

==Compac Plus==

The &quot;Compac Plus&quot; or &quot;Compact Plus&quot; is a disc packaging which is similar in style to a digipak. However, it consists of two plastic CD trays which &quot;clip&quot; together like a normal slipcase. The packaging was introduced in the early 1990s. It was originally a brand that had its own logo and was used by bands such as Blur, but as years progressed, many other artists started to use their own version of the packaging.

==Keep case==

A &quot;keep case&quot; is the most common type of DVD packaging and was created by Amaray. It is taller and thicker than a Jewel case, and is made of much softer, less brittle plastic (polypropylene rather than polystyrene), so it does not break as easily. They usually hold one or two discs but are capable of holding up to six discs. Slimmer keep cases, so-called &quot;Slim-paks&quot; or &quot;Thinpaks&quot; typically used for DVD box sets consisting of the thin keep cases stored in a paperboard box. The thin cases are half as thick and can generally only hold one disc as a result, but there are newer slim cases that have central disc holding teeth on both sides. The teeth are made in such a way that when the case is closed, they go between the gaps between the teeth on the other side.

A standard DVD case is a single-piece plastic case with two creases, which folds around and snaps closed. It measures . It is wrapped on the outside by a thin piece of transparent plastic that can hold a paper label. The label measures .

Some DVD releases have a paperboard outer sleeve around the shrink wrap.

Beginning in 2007, prerecorded Blu-ray and HD DVD titles ship in packages similar to but slightly smaller (18.5 mm shorter and 1 mm thinner: 135 mm × 171.5 mm × 13 mm) than a standard DVD keep case, generally with the format logo prominently displayed in a horizontal stripe across the top of the case (red for HD DVD; and PlayStation 3 Greatest Hits Games, blue for Blu-ray, and clear for regular PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Switch cartridge games). Green cases of this variety were introduced to be used for titles released for the Xbox One gaming system, though with the space intended for placing the disc being on the left side of the inner case, while most other keep cases have it on the right.

==Snap case==
A &quot;snap case&quot; is a design for both CD and DVD packaging, and is made in the standard sizes for both. Each is made of a single-piece plastic tray and closure, which snaps over the right edge of the front flap. The printed flap is made of thin paperboard which wraps around the left edge and across the back of the tray, to which it is glued. It has largely been replaced with the DVD keep case and CD jewel case due to its flimsy design. Time Warner&#x27;s two studios and their boutique labels (Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema) were the only major entities to utilize this case design for DVD packaging.

==Soft case/green case==

&quot;Soft cases&quot;, also known as &quot;earth cases&quot; or &quot;green cases&quot;, are soft-shell cases made from recycled optical discs. They are considerably more pliable than other style cases given that they are made from various mixes of plastics. They are sold by various companies as replacements for disc owners who are environmentally friendly and can be differentiated from other cases by their opaque appearance. The softness of the cases leads them to break less, though the safety of the enclosed disc may be somewhat sacrificed since the case can be bent end-to-end easily.

==SteelBook==
SteelBook is a trademarked name for a disc case constructed from durable metal to create a tin box-style package similar in size and shape to the keep case. It is used in memorabilia sets such as collector&#x27;s editions, and commonly printed with full-color artwork, varnished, and embossed to provide additional visual dimensionality.

==Eco pack==
In 2006, Universal Music Group introduced the first completely paper-recyclable CD case, called the &quot;eco pack&quot;. The sleeve is printed on recycled card, and the tray is made from International Paper&#x27;s PaperFoam. Universal used this packaging for issues in its &quot;20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection&quot; series after 2006.

==Lift-lock case==
Many gold CDs, including those from Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, are packaged in lift-lock cases, a special type of case where the CD is lifted out of the case automatically and a latch unlocked when opened. The advantage of this design is that only the edges of the disc are handled when removing it from the case, and the disc is never subjected to any bending force while being removed. From the outside, they appear almost identical to a standard jewel case. They have the same dimensions as a standard jewel case, and use standard booklets and back cards.

==Spindles and other bulk packaging==

Blank CD and DVD media are often sold in bulk packages called spindles or, less formally, cake boxes. This type of packaging consists of a round, clear plastic cup that mates bayonet-style to a base with a central post that holds a stack of discs (both made from polypropylene); dummy discs made of clear polycarbonate with no recording surface are often packed on the ends of the stack to avoid scratches from contact with the hard plastic of the packages. Such packages have been designed to hold anywhere from ten up to 100 discs and offer the user multiple options for packaging the finalized disc.

TDK and Memorex have begun selling some of their blank media in what they refer to as &quot;Snap n&#x27; Save&quot; cases, essentially polyethylene cases designed to hold up to ten discs in a package.

Finally, some bulk packages of blank media forgo a permanent container completely, instead using a simple blister pack for small numbers of media, or bundling large numbers of discs in shrink wrap to reduce waste.

== Multi-disc albums ==

Record shops and consumer electronics stores sell albums or books that contain numerous soft plastic sleeves, which can be used to store CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs, video game discs, and other discs. Some of the small books or albums can hold 12 discs. Some of the large albums or books can hold over 90 discs. The owner can either keep the original packaging (cases, booklets, etc.) or discard them.

<text>The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) () is the state news agency of North Korea. The agency portrays the views of the North Korean government for both domestic and foreign consumption. It was established on December 5, 1946, and now features online coverage.

==Organization==
KCNA works under the Korean Central Broadcasting Committee, through which it is ultimately controlled by the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea&#x27;s Propaganda and Agitation Department. In December 1996, KCNA began publishing its news articles on the Internet with its web server located in Japan. Since October 2010, stories have been published on a new site, controlled from Pyongyang, and output has been significantly increased to include world stories with no specific link to North Korea as well as news from countries that have strong DPRK ties.

In addition to Korean, KCNA releases news translated into English, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish. Access to its website, along with other North Korean news sites, has been blocked by South Korea since 2004 and can be accessed only through the government&#x27;s authorization. As well as serving as a news agency, it also produces summaries of world news to North Korean officials and publishes the &quot;&quot;. It is also alleged to conduct clandestine intelligence collection.

Based in the capital Pyongyang, at 1 Potonggang-dong, Potonggang District, KCNA has bureaus in several municipalities. KCNA also has press exchange agreements with around 46 foreign news agencies, including South Korea&#x27;s Yonhap. Its closest partners, however, are TASS and Xinhua News Agency. KCNA has correspondents and bureaus in six countries, including Russia and China. The correspondents are located in Russia, China, Cuba, Iran, India, and Egypt. KCNA also collaborates with Reuters and the Associated Press, the latter of which has a permanent bureau in Pyongyang. KCNA journalists have trained abroad with the BBC and Reuters. KCNA is a member of Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies since 1982. The agency employs 800 people.

According to its website, KCNA &quot;speaks for the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and the DPRK government&quot;. The agency has been described as the &quot;official organ.&quot; In June 1964 on one of his first official activities, Kim Jong Il visited KCNA headquarters and said the agency should be &quot;propagating the revolutionary ideology of the leader (Kim Il Sung) widely throughout the world.&quot; However, the agency is also said to offer a unique insight into the North Korean &quot;mentality.&quot;

A talk given to officials at KCNA on June 12, 1964, outlines the function of the news agency:

Under the principle and guideline on the work of ideological propaganda and agitation put by the country&#x27;s ruling party, the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, the agency generally reports only good news about the country that is intended to encourage its people and project a positive image abroad. Nonetheless, it has on occasion acknowledged food shortages in the country. The Ryongchon disaster was also reported in April 2004, after a delay of two days.

The Director General of KCNA is Kim Chang-gwang. KCNA has a sports team in the annual Paektusan Prize Games of Civil Servants.

==Recurring themes==

KCNA articles generally revolve on several specific themes:
* Detailing performances of cultural events, usually attended by various dignitaries.
* Decrying the actions and attitudes of the United States, Japan, South Korea, Israel and other nations, particularly concerning military cooperation, historical events or trade among those nations. Personal attacks on American, Japanese, South Korean and Israeli leaders are common.
* Airing the official DPRK position on ongoing disputes with Japan over such matters as Chongryon and comfort women.
* Supporting the Axis of Resistance.
* Calling for the destruction of Israel.
* Noting the celebration of DPRK events and ideas in other countries.
* Calling for the reunification of Korea under the Juche ideology.
* Promoting the popularity of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un. Such instances would detail the daily routines of the leaders, or praise from friendly organisations in other countries.
* Communications, visits and gifts (it does not name the particular gift) to and from various like-minded or friendly nations. Regarding the number of gifts, KCNA claimed that former leader Kim Il Sung receives &quot;2,910 a year, 243 a month and 8 a day.&quot;
* New technological developments, such as a preservation agent for the Kimjongilia flower, a new kind of pesticide and &quot;blood purifying&quot; rings and bracelets [a quack remedy], amongst others.
*Emphasizing the names of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un by enlarging their names to appear larger than the rest of the text.
*References to institutes, groups or centres &quot;for the study of the Juche idea&quot;. For example, a KCNA report from June 12, 2011, claimed that &quot;The Brazilian Center for the Study of the Juche Idea was inaugurated with due ceremony at São Paulo University on June 4&quot;. The article also refers to an unnamed &quot;chairman&quot; (who presumably presided over the ceremony), but this supposed event was not reported by a source other than KCNA as of the date of the article (eight days after the ceremony was alleged to have occurred).

===Editorial practices===
KCNA employs language, such as &quot;traitors&quot;, &quot;warmongers&quot; or &quot;human scum&quot;, for governments (especially those of South Korea and the United States), organizations and individuals who are deemed characteristic of those terms. In contrast, Kim Jong Un, Kim Jong Il and Kim Il Sung are credited for their &quot;outstanding wisdom&quot;, &quot;unique abilities&quot; or &quot;noble virtue&quot;.

Because of this, KCNA is often considered as a fake news website by many critics.

===New Year editorials===
As a tradition since 1996, KCNA, along with the three main state run newspapers in North Korea, publishes a joint New Year editorial that outlines the country&#x27;s policies for the year. The editorials usually offer praise for the Songun policy, the government and leadership, and encourage the growth of the nation. They are also critical of the policies of South Korea, Japan, the United States and Western governments towards the country.
On January 1, 2006, the agency sent out a joint-editorial from North Korea&#x27;s state newspapers calling for the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. While annual January 1 editorials are a tradition among the papers, that year&#x27;s brought attention from Western media outlets, by calling for a &quot;nationwide campaign for driving out the U.S. troops&quot;. The editorial made several references to Korean reunification. The 2009 editorial received similar attention, as criticism of United States policy was absent, and the admission of severe economic problems in the country. The editorial also made reference to denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, in what analysts claimed was a &quot;hopeful&quot; sign. This was echoed again in its 2010 editorial, which called for an end to hostilities with the United States and a nuclear free Korean Peninsula.

The 2011 joint editorial edition, aside from its calls for a denuclearized Korea and for a slowdown of tensions between the two Koreas, has for the first time, mentioned the rising light industries of the DPRK, given as a reason for an upcoming upsurge in the national economy in the new year and for the achievement of the Kangsong Taeguk national mission.

The 2012 joint editorial edition, the first under Kim Jong Un&#x27;s leadership, started with a great tribute to Kim Jong Il and aside from recurring calls for improving inter-Korean relations and for the fulfillment of the October 4 Declaration of 2007, also called on the whole nation to give priority to do Kim Jong Il&#x27;s 2012 mission of Strong and Prosperous Nation, continue his and his father Kim Il Sung&#x27;s legacies to the entire country and the socialist cause, and to build up and encourage the various sectors that compose the nation to become contributors to national progress in all areas at all costs.

This practice ended in 2013 when Kim Jong Un delivered the first New Year speech on television in 19 years.

===Censorship===
Following the purge and execution of Jang Song-thaek, KCNA conducted its largest censorship operation on its webpage. Some 35,000 articles of Korean-language original reporting were deleted. Counting translations, a total of 100,000 articles were removed. Additionally, some articles were edited to omit Jang&#x27;s name. Not all of the deleted articles mentioned Jang directly.

<doc id="632410" wikidata="Q562167" url="?curid=632410" title="Douglas A-26 Invader">
<text>The Douglas A-26 Invader (designated B-26 between 1948 and 1965) is an American twin-engined light bomber and ground attack aircraft. Built by Douglas Aircraft Company during World War II, the Invader also saw service during several major Cold War conflicts. A limited number of highly modified United States Air Force aircraft served in Southeast Asia until 1969. It was a fast aircraft capable of carrying a large bomb load. A range of guns could be fitted to produce a formidable ground-attack aircraft.

A redesignation of the type from A-26 to B-26 has led to confusion with the earlier and unrelated Martin B-26 Marauder, which had already been withdrawn from service when the designation was reused.

==Design and development==

The A-26 was Douglas Aircraft&#x27;s successor to the A-20 (DB-7) Havoc, also known as Douglas Boston. Designed by Ed Heinemann, Robert Donovan, and Ted R. Smith, the innovative NACA 65-215 laminar-flow airfoil wing of the A-26 was the work of project aerodynamics expert A.M.O. Smith.

The Douglas XA-26 prototype (AAC Ser. No. 41-19504) first flew on 10 July 1942 at Mines Field, El Segundo, with test pilot Benny Howard at the controls. Flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling but engine-cooling problems led to cowling changes and elimination of the propeller spinners on production aircraft. During testing, the nose wheel was found to be structurally inadequate and strengthened.
The early A-26 versions were built in two forms
* The A-26B gun-nose could be equipped with a combination of armament, including .50 caliber machine guns, 20 or 37mm auto cannon, or an experimental 75mm pack howitzer (never used operationally). The &#x27;B&#x27; gun-nose version housed six (and later, eight) .50 caliber machine guns, officially the &quot;all-purpose nose&quot;, later known as the &quot;six-gun nose&quot; or &quot;eight-gun nose&quot;.
* The A-26C″s &quot;glass&quot; &quot;Bombardier nose&quot;, contained a Norden bombsight for medium-altitude precision bombing. The A-26C nose section included two fixed M-2 guns, but those were eliminated after underwing gun packs or internal guns in the wings proved effective during colder weather.

After about 1,570 production aircraft, three guns were installed in each wing, coinciding with the introduction of the &quot;eight-gun nose&quot; for A-26Bs, giving some versions as many as 14 .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in fixed forward mounts. An A-26C nose section could be replaced with an A-26B nose section, or vice versa, in a few hours, thus physically (and officially) changing the designation and operational role. The &quot;flat-topped&quot; canopy was changed in late 1944 after about 820 production aircraft, to a clamshell style with greatly improved visibility.

Alongside the pilot in an A-26B, a crew member served as navigator and gun loader for the pilot-operated nose guns. In an A-26C, that crew member served as navigator and bombardier, and moved to the nose section to bomb. A few A-26Cs were fitted with dual flight controls, some parts of which could be disabled in flight for access to the nose section. Access for the bombardier was through the lower section of the right instrument panel; he normally sat next to the pilot. This was similar to British designs such as the Lancaster, Blenheim/Beaufort, Wellington, etc. A tractor-style &quot;jump seat&quot; was behind the &quot;navigator&#x27;s seat&quot;. In most missions, a third crew member in the rear gunner&#x27;s compartment operated the remote-controlled dorsal and ventral gun turrets, with access to-and-from the cockpit via the bomb bay only if that was empty. The gunner operated both dorsal and ventral turrets via a novel, complex and unreliable dual-ended periscope sight, a vertical column running through the center of the rear compartment, with traversing and elevating/depressing periscope sights on each end. The gunner sat on a seat facing rearwards looking into a binocular periscope sight mounted on the column, controlling the guns with a pair of handles on the sides of the column. Aimed above the centerline of the aircraft, the mirror in the center of the column &#x27;flipped&#x27;, showing the gunner a limited view similar to the view the upper periscope was seeing. As he pressed the handles downward, and as the bead passed the centerline, the mirror automatically flipped, transferring the sight &quot;seamlessly&quot; to the lower periscope. The guns aimed in the approximate direction the periscope was aimed, automatically transferring between upper and lower turrets as required, and computing for parallax and other factors. While novel and sound in principle, the developers invested a great deal of time and effort in their attempts to get the system to work, delaying production. As might be expected, the complex system was difficult to maintain in the field.

==Operational history==
===World War II===

====Pacific====
Douglas officially delivered the first production model A-26B aircraft to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) on 10 September 1943. These were sent for field evaluation in actual combat operations, with the Fifth Air Force in the Southwest Pacific theater. The A-26 first saw action on 23 June 1944, when four aircraft attached to the 3rd Bombardment Group&#x27;s 13th Squadron (&quot;The Grim Reapers&quot;), bombed Japanese-held islands near Manokwari. Aircrew from &quot;The Grim Reapers&quot;, while evaluating these four A-26Bs, noted that downward views from the cockpit were significantly hindered by the nature of the design – especially the positioning of the engines – which made the A-26B unsuitable for its intended role of ground attack. In response to such evaluations, General George Kenney, commander of the Far East Air Forces, stated: &quot;We do not want the A-26 under any circumstances as a replacement for anything.&quot; Nevertheless, development continued. While the 3rd BG was waiting suitably modified A-26s, it requested additional Douglas A-20 Havocs, although both types were used in composite flights.

Some USAAF units in the Pacific that operated either the A-20 or B-25 received the A-26 for trials in limited quantities.

The 319th Bomb Group was fully converted to the A-26 in March 1945, when it commenced operations with the 3rd BG. In August, after a few dozen A-26 missions, it became evident that the war was coming to an abrupt close, and operations began to wind down. The 319th officially ceased combat operations on 12 August 1945.

==== Europe====
Douglas needed better results from the Invader&#x27;s second combat test, so ferried A-26s arrived in Europe in late September 1944 for assignment to the Ninth Air Force. The initial deployment involved 18 aircraft and crews assigned to the 553d Squadron of the 386th Bomb Group. This unit flew their first mission on 6 September 1944. No aircraft were lost on the eight test missions, and the Ninth Air Force announced they were satisfied, eventually replacing their A-20s and B-26s with the A-26 Invader.

The first group to convert to the A-26B was 416th Bombardment Group. With it, they entered combat on 17 November, and the 409th Bombardment Group, whose A-26s became operational in late November. Due to a shortage of A-26C variants, the groups flew a combined A-20/A-26 unit until deliveries of the glass-nosed version caught up. Besides bombing and strafing, tactical reconnaissance and night interdiction missions were successful. In contrast to the Pacific-based units, the A-26 was well received by pilots and crew alike, and by 1945, the 9th AF had 11,567 missions, dropping 18,054 tons of bombs, recording seven confirmed kills while losing 67 aircraft.

In Italy, the Twelfth Air Force&#x27;s 47th Bomb Group also received the A-26 starting in January 1945. They were used against German transport links, and for direct support and interdiction against tanks and troop concentrations in the Po Valley in the final campaigns in Italy.

===Postwar era===

==== United States ====
With the establishment of the United States Air Force (USAF) as an independent service in 1947, the Strategic Air Command operated the again redesignated B-26 as an RB-26 reconnaissance aircraft in service 1949 to 1950. U.S. Air Forces in Europe continued operating the B-26 until 1957. Tactical Air Command operated the aircraft as both a B-26 and later designated back to A-26; the final variant was designated B-26K until 1966, then it again became the A-26A. This final version continued in service through the late 1960s with active-duty special-operations TAC units, and through 1972 with TAC-gained special-operations units of the Air National Guard.

The U.S. Navy obtained Invaders from the USAF to use these aircraft in their utility squadrons (VU) for target towing and general utility until superseded by the DC-130A variant of the C-130 Hercules. The Navy designation was JD-1 and JD-1D until 1962, then the JD-1 was redesignated UB-26J. The JD-1D was also used under the designation of DB-26J. The CIA also used the type for covert operations.

The last A-26 in active US service was assigned to the Air National Guard; that aircraft was retired from military service in 1972 by the USAF and the National Guard Bureau, and donated to the National Air and Space Museum.

=====Korean War=====

B-26 Invaders of the 3rd Bombardment Group, operating from bases in southern Japan, were among the first USAF aircraft engaged in the Korean War, carrying out missions over South Korea on 27 and 28 June, before carrying out the first USAF bombing mission on North Korea on 29 June 1950, bombing an airfield near Pyongyang.


On 10 August 1950, the Air Force Reserve&#x27;s 452d Bombardment Wing was activated for Korean service. It flew its first missions in November 1950 from Itazuke, Japan, providing daylight support, with the 3rd Bomb Wing, consisting of the 8th, 13th, and 90th Bomb Squadrons, flying night missions. Because of the Chinese intervention, they were forced to find another base, so they moved to Miho Air Base on the west coast of Honshū. In early 1951, they moved to Pusan East (K-9) Air Base, continuing their daylight and night-intruder missions. In June 1951, they joined the 3rd Bomb Wing (Kunsan (K-8)) in night activity only, dividing the target areas, with the 452nd taking the eastern half and the 3rd the western. For their efforts in the Korean War, they received two unit citations and the Korean Presidential Citation. They also received credit for eight campaign operations.

In May 1952, they were inactivated. Their aircraft and equipment along with their personnel were absorbed by the 17th Bomb Wing. During their time as an active unit, the 452nd flew 15,000 sorties (7,000 at night) with a loss of 85 crewmen.

B-26s were credited with the destruction of 38,500 vehicles, 406 locomotives, 3,700 railway trucks, and seven enemy aircraft on the ground. On 14 September 1951, Captain John S. Walmsley Jr. attacked a supply train. After all his guns simultaneously jammed, he illuminated the target with his searchlight to enable his wingmen to destroy the train. Walmsley was shot down, and posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Invaders carried out the last USAF bombing mission of the war 24 minutes before the armistice agreement was signed on 27 July 1953.

In addition to the standard attack versions of the B-26 for night interdiction missions, modified WB-26s and RB-26s of the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing flew critical weather observation and reconnaissance missions in supporting roles.

=====Southeast Asia=====
The first B-26s to arrive in Southeast Asia deployed to Takhli RTAFB, Thailand in December 1960. These unmarked aircraft, operated under the auspices of the U.S. CIA (Central Intelligence Agency), were augmented by an additional 16 aircraft— 12 B-26Bs and B-26Cs plus four RB-26Cs under Operation Millpond. Their mission was assisting the Royal Lao Government in fighting the Pathet Lao. The repercussions from the Bay of Pigs invasion meant no combat missions are known flown, although RB-26Cs operated over Laos until the end of 1961. Then, the aircraft operated in South Vietnam under Project Farm Gate. The only other deployment of B-26 aircraft to Laos prior to the introduction of the B-26K/A-26A was the deployment of two RB-26C aircraft modified for night reconnaissance during May–July 1962 under Project Black Watch. These aircraft, drawn from Farm Gate stocks, were returned at the end of these missions.

The aircraft from Laos participated in the early phase of the Vietnam War with the USAF, but with Vietnamese markings as part of Project Farm Gate. Although Farm Gate operated B-26Bs, B-26Cs, and genuine RB-26Cs, many of these aircraft were operated under the designation RB-26C, although they were used in a combat capacity. During 1963, two RB-26Cs were sent to Clark AB in the Philippines for modifications, although not with night systems similar to those modified for Black Watch. The two aircraft returned from Black Watch to Farm Gate were redesignated RB-26L to distinguish them from other modified RB-26Cs, and were assigned to Project Sweet Sue. Farm Gate&#x27;s B-26s operated alongside the other primary strike aircraft of the time, the T-28 Trojan, before both aircraft types were replaced by the Douglas A-1 Skyraider. The B-26s were withdrawn from service in February 1964 after two accidents related to wing-spar fatigue, one during combat in Southeast Asia in August 1963 and one during a demonstration at Eglin AFB, Florida, in February 1964.

On 11 February 1964, two pilots from the 1st Air Commando Wing stationed at Florida&#x27;s Hurlburt Field died in the crash of a B-26 on Range 52 at Eglin AFB after it lost a wing during pull-out from a demonstration strafing pass. The aircraft was participating in a demonstration of the Special Air Warfare Center&#x27;s counterinsurgency capabilities, and completed a strafing run demonstration before the incident. SAWC presented the demonstration on an average of twice each month for the previous two years. B-26 aircraft used by USAF Commandos in Vietnam were grounded 8 April 1964 following an investigation into the 11 February incident. B-26 aircraft in use by the South Vietnamese Air Force were also grounded in accordance with the U.S. ruling.

In response to this, the On Mark Engineering Company of Van Nuys, California, was selected by the USAF to extensively upgrade the Invader for its new counterinsurgency role. The first production flight of the B-26K was on 30 May 1964 at the Van Nuys Airport. On Mark converted 40 Invaders to the new B-26K Counter-Invader standard of upgraded engines, propellers, and brakes, remanufactured wings, and wing-tip fuel tanks for use by the 609th Special Operations Squadron. In May 1966, the B-26K was again redesignated A-26A for political reasons (Thailand did not allow U.S. bombers in-country at the time, so the Invaders were redesignated again with an &quot;A&quot;, for attack aircraft), and deployed in Thailand to help disrupt supplies moving along the Ho Chi Minh trail. Two of these aircraft were modified with a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) system under project Lonesome Tiger, as a part of Operation Shed Light.

=====CIA=====

In early 1961, about 20 B-26Bs, most converted from B-26C configuration, were &quot;sanitized&quot; at Duke Field (also known as Auxiliary Field Three at Eglin AFB), Florida. They had defensive armament removed, and were fitted with the eight-gun nose, underwing drop tanks, and rocket racks. They were flown to a CIA-run base in Guatemala, where training was under way for B-26, C-46, and C-54 Cuban exile air crews by personnel from the Alabama Air National Guard. After transfer to Nicaragua in early April 1961, they were painted in the markings of the Fuerza Aérea Revolucionaria (FAR), the air force of the Cuban government.

On 15 April 1961, crewed by Cuban exiles, eight B-26s of the &quot;Fuerza Aérea de Liberación&quot; (FAL) attacked three Cuban airfields to destroy FAR combat aircraft on the ground. On 17 April 1961, FAL B-26s supported the seaborne Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The conflict ended on 19 April, after the loss of nine FAL B-26s, ten Cuban exiles, and four American aircrew in combat. The FAR flew B-26Cs in the conflict, one of which was downed by friendly fire from a CIA &quot;command ship&quot; with the loss of four Cuban aircrew.

The CIA contracted pilots, some employed during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, to fly B-26Ks for ground attack against &quot;Simba&quot; rebels in the Congo Crisis. Newly remanufactured B-26K Counter-Invaders were delivered to the Congo via Hurlburt Field in 1964.

====France====
In the 1950s, the French Air Force&#x27;s (&#x27;) bombing groups (&#x27;) including Bombardment Group I/19 Gascogne (GB I/19) and GB 1/25 &quot;Tunisia&quot;, used B-26s, during the First Indochina War, lent to France by the USAF.

Haiphong Cat Bi-based Douglas B-26 Invaders operated over Dien Bien Phu in March and April 1954 during the siege of Dien Bien Phu. In this period, a massive use of Philippines-based USAF B-29s against the Viet Minh heavy artillery, including the potential use of nuclear weapons, was planned by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff with the French as Operation Vulture, but was cancelled by the governments, while at the conclusion of the battle, some of the beleaguered French troops managed to escape through the jungle to neighboring Thailand.

====Indonesia====
Concerned about Indonesian President Sukarno&#x27;s communist leanings, the CIA started Operation Haik in 1958 to overthrow his Guided Democracy in Indonesia regime. The covert operation committed at least a dozen B-26 Invaders in support of rebel forces. On 18 May 1958, American contract pilot Allen Pope&#x27;s blacked-out B-26 was initially hit by antiaircraft ground fire and then brought down by a North American P-51 Mustang flown by Capt. Ignatius Dewanto (the only known air-to-air shoot-down in the history of the Indonesian Air Force). The capture and trial of Lieutenant Pope brought a quick end to Operation Haik, but the capabilities of the Invader were not lost on the Indonesian government. In 1959, the government purchased six aircraft at Davis-Monthan AFB, which were ferried to Indonesia in full military markings during mid-1960. Used in a number of actions against rebels in various areas, these aircraft went on to long follow-up careers. The last operational flights of three final survivors were in 1976, supporting the Indonesian invasion of East Timor. In 1977, the last two flying aircraft were retired.

====Portugal====
The Portuguese Air Force purchased Invaders covertly for use in Portuguese Angola in 1965, during the Portuguese Colonial War.

====Democratic Republic of the Congo====
B-26s were used in support of the Dragon operations to liberate Western hostages held by Simba terrorists during the Congo Crisis.

====Biafra====
Biafra used two provisionally armed (&quot;provo&quot;) B-26s in combat during the Nigerian Civil War in 1967, flown, among others, by Jan Zumbach.

==Variants==

===Douglas/U.S. military variants===
Many of the A-26/B-26 Invader&#x27;s production run of 2,452 were early A-26Bs and A-26Cs.
;XA-26
:Serial no. 41-19504 served as the prototype for the series; initially flown with dummy armament

;XA-26A
:Serial no. 41-19505 served as a prototype night fighter with a crew of two – pilot plus radar-operator/gunner
;XA-26B
:Serial no. 41-19588 was a prototype &quot;solid-nosed&quot; attack variant with crew of three: pilot, gun loader/navigator (in front cockpit) plus gunner in rear, and carrying a forward-firing 75 mm (2.75 in) cannon.
:Attack bomber with solid nose carrying six or eight 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns. Production totals: 1,355 A-26Bs were built and delivered, 205 at Tulsa, Oklahoma (A-26B-5-DT to A-26B-25-DT) plus 1,150 at Long Beach, California (A-26B-1-DL to A-26B-66-DL). About 24 more airframes were built at Long Beach but not delivered to USAAF, some of those later sold to other civil and military customers. A-26B was redesignated &quot;B-26B&quot; with USAF in 1948.
;TB-26B
:Unarmed variant converted from B-26B for training purposes.
;VB-26B
:Unarmed variant converted from B-26B for administrative purposes.
;
:Attack bomber. Production totals: 1,091 A-26Cs were built and delivered, five at Long Beach, California (A-26C-1-DL and A-26C-2-DL) plus 1,086 at Tulsa, Oklahoma (A-26C-16-DT to A-26B-55-DT). About 53 more airframes were built at Tulsa but not delivered to USAAF, some of those later sold to other civil and military customers. A-26C was redesignated &quot;B-26C&quot; with USAF in 1948.
;RB-26C
:Unarmed photo reconnaissance variant converted from B-26C; it carried cameras and flash flares for night photography. Designated &quot;FA-26C&quot; prior to 1962.
;TB-26C
:Unarmed variant converted from B-26C for training purposes.
;XA-26D
:Serial no. 44-34776 prototype for the proposed A-26D attack bomber with uprated Chevrolet manufactured R-2800-83 engines, and late model A-26B armament of eight 0.50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in solid nose and six 0.50 in (12.7 mm) guns in the wing; series of 750 A-26Ds was cancelled after V-J Day.
;XA-26E
:Serial no. 44-25563 prototype for the A-26E attack bomber. As with the XA-26D, but with an A-26C-type glass nose; a contract for 2,150 A-26E-DTs was cancelled following V-J Day.
;XA-26F
:Serial no. 44-34586 prototype for a high-speed A-26F powered by two R-2800-83 engines driving four-bladed propellers with a s.t. General Electric J31 turbojet installed in the rear fuselage. The prototype reached a top speed of but the series was cancelled as performance gains were not sufficient.
;A-26Z
:Unofficial designation for a proposed postwar production version of the A-26. It was to have a more powerful version of the Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 radial engine and was to be fitted with such features as a raised pilot&#x27;s cockpit canopy, an improved cockpit arrangement, and wingtip drop tanks. If produced, the unglazed nose version would have been designated A-26G and the glazed nose version A-26H. However, in October 1945, the USAAF concluded that enough A-26 aircraft were available to meet postwar needs; consequently, the A-26Z version was not produced.

;JD-1
:U.S. Navy version with one A-26B (AAF Ser. No. 44-34217) and one A-26C (AAF Ser. No. 44-35467) redesignated during World War II, postwar, 150 surplus A-26s for use by land-based Navy utility squadrons (VU) as target tugs and later, drone directors (designated JD-1D) and general utility aircraft. In 1962, the JD-1 and JD-1D were redesignated UB-26J and DB-26J respectively.
;YB-26K
:On Mark Engineering prototype for refurbished attack bomber; modifications included rebuilt, strengthened wings, enlarged tail assembly, new R-2800-103W engines with reversible propellers/propeller spinners, dual controls, wingtip tanks, newer avionics, and increased hardpoint/armament enhancements.

;B-26K
:On Mark Engineering conversions of a total of 40 aircraft; B-26Bs or TB-26Bs with two B-26Cs and a single JB-26C; changes included fitting of R-2800-52W engines with no propeller spinners and the six wing guns deleted. During operations in Vietnam, in May 1966, the aircraft were reassigned the old attack designation of &quot;A-26A&quot;. The A-26As were retired in 1969 when they had reached the safe limits of allotted flying time.
;RB-26L
:Two RB-26Cs (44-34718 and 44-35782) were modified for night photography missions.
;B-26N
:Unofficial designation applied to B-26s operated by the French Air Force (&quot;&quot;) in Algeria as night fighters. These aircraft were modified B-26Cs fitted with AI Mk X radar taken from obsolete Meteor NF 11 night fighters, two underwing gun packs each with two 0.50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns and SNEB rocket pods.
;WB-26
:Weather reconnaissance version first produced and used in the Korean War, 2 used by NOAA from 1960 to 1975.

===Third-party civil variants===
Since 1945, over 300 A-26s have been on the FAA U.S. Civil Aircraft Register. Perhaps up to 100 of those were probably only registered for ferry flights from USAF bases such as Davis-Monthan AFB, AZ, and Hill AFB, UT, to civil airports and stored as candidates for sale on the civil or overseas military markets.

The initial main civil uses were as &quot;executive&quot; personnel transports with minimal modifications such as removal of military features, bomb-bay doors sealed shut, passenger-entry stairs in bomb bay, and the conversion of the fuselage to accept six to eight passengers. Improvements developed considerably until the early 1960s, when purpose-built executive types such as the turboprop Gulfstream I became available.

During the mid-1950s, A-26s were tested and used as air tankers for suppression of forest and wildland fires, and briefly used borate-based retardants, hence the inaccurate and unofficial term &quot;borate bombers&quot;. Borate was later discontinued due to its undesirable ecologic effects, replaced with retardant mixtures of water, clays, fertilizers, and red dyes. That use of A-26s on USDA contracts was discontinued in major regions by about 1973, after many of the A-26 air tankers found willing purchasers in Canada.

Much early development of conversions was carried out by Grand Central Aircraft, whose drawings and personnel were taken up by the On Mark Engineering Company of Van Nuys, California, from about 1955. By the 1960s, On Mark had an exclusive license from Douglas Aircraft Company for manufacture and sale of parts for A-26s. The on Mark Executive (1956), the On Mark Marketeer (1957), and the pressurized On Mark Marksman (1961) were products of this effort.
A significant conversion was the Rock Island Monarch 26, while less numerous and more basic conversions for executive operations were carried out by Wold Engineering, LB Smith Aircraft Corp., R. G. LeTourneau Inc, Rhodes-Berry Company and Lockheed Aircraft Service Inc.
Garrett AiResearch used two A-26 variants as testbeds for turbine engines; see also XA-26F above.

==Notable appearances in media==
In July 2005, the archaeological television program &quot;Time Team&quot; of the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, along with members of RAF Millom Museum, took part in a major project to excavate the crash sites of two A-26 Invader aircraft after the aircraft collided shortly after take-off over marshes close to the then USAAF BAD 2 airbase at Warton in Lancashire on 29 November 1944. The aircraft, A-26B-10-DT &quot;43-22298&quot; and A-26B-15-DT &quot;43-22336&quot;, were en route to Brétigny, Oise, in northern France for service with the 641st Bombardment Squadron of the 409th Bombardment Group.

<text>The Honolulu Star-Bulletin was a daily newspaper based in Honolulu, Hawaii, United States. At the time publication ceased on June 6, 2010, it was the second largest daily newspaper in the state of Hawaii (after the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;).

The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, along with a sister publication called &quot;MidWeek&quot;, was owned by Black Press of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and administered by a council of local Hawaii investors. The daily merged with the &quot;Advertiser&quot; on June 7, 2010, to form the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;, after Black Press&#x27;s attempts to find a buyer fell through.

==History==

===Farrington Era===

The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; traces its roots to the February 1, 1882, founding of the &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot; by J. W. Robertson and Company. In 1912, it merged with the &quot;Hawaiian Star&quot; to become the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;. Wallace Rider Farrington, who later became territorial governor of Hawaii, was the editor of the newspaper from 1898 and the president and publisher from 1912 until his death. His son Joseph Rider Farrington succeeded him and served as president and publisher until his own death in 1954. From 1962 it was owned by a local group of investors led by Elizabeth P. Farrington and Chinn Ho and operated under a joint operating agreement with the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; that allowed the two papers to use the same printing facilities and sales personnel (the Hawaii Newspaper Agency) while maintaining separate fully competitive editorial staffs and providing Honolulu with two distinct editorial &quot;voices.&quot;

===Gannett Era===
Gannett Pacific Corporation, a subsidiary of Gannett Corporation, purchased the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; in 1971 under the terms of the existing joint operating agreement. The terms of the joint operating agreement did not allow one company to own both newspapers, so in 1992, Gannett sold the Honolulu Star-Bulletin to Liberty Newspapers so that it could purchase the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser.&quot; The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&#x27;s&quot; circulation was allowed to decline thereafter and staffing reduced.

On September 16, 1999, Liberty Newspapers announced that it planned to close the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; the following month. The decision was met with fierce resistance in the community and lawsuits were filed against Liberty and Gannett by the state and by concerned citizens&#x27; groups. The shutdown was postponed with an injunction by a federal district judge two weeks before the scheduled date of closure.

===Black era===
In April 2000, Liberty Newspapers offered the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; for sale. The action once again threatened the closure of the publication, but in November of that year, Canadian publishing magnate David Black announced his intent to purchase the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;. When the purchase was finalized in 2001, the joint operating agreement came to an end and Black moved the paper&#x27;s administration and editorial offices to new headquarters in Restaurant Row near Honolulu Harbor. The newspaper was printed in Kaneohe, on the presses of the &quot;Star-Bulletin&#x27;s&quot; sister publication, &quot;MidWeek&quot;. (Black had purchased &quot;MidWeek&quot; shortly before the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; deal was closed—and at a time when no one in the local business community was aware that it was for sale.)

On April 13, 2009, &quot;The Star-Bulletin&quot; made the conversion from a broadsheet to a tabloid format in an effort to retain its readership base, even though the move resulted in the layoff of 17 editorial staffers (about 20% of its unionized workforce). This was done to save costs. However, the format did not help as it continued to lose both money and readership. At the same time, Gannett was looking into selling the Advertiser as the company decided that it did not fit in with Gannett&#x27;s long-term strategy. This move would lead to Black Press pursuing a deal that would result in buying the Advertiser, a more profitable paper with a daily circulation of 115,000, even though the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; itself was losing money and had a daily circulation of 37,000.

===Merger===

On February 25, 2010, Black Press purchased only the &quot;physical assets&quot; of &quot;The Honolulu Advertiser&quot;. As part of the deal to acquire the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, Black Press agreed to place the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; on the selling block. If no buyer came forward by March 29, 2010, Black Press would start making preparations to operate both papers through a transitional management team and then combine the two dailies into one.

On March 30, 2010, three parties came forward with offers to buy the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot;, but a month later on April 27, 2010, the bids were rejected because their bid for the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; was below the minimum, liquidation price, resulting in Black Press cancelling any sale and proceeding with transition plans, which came on the same day that they were approved to take over the &quot;Advertiser&quot; by the Department of Justice.

On May 3, 2010, a new company set by Black Press, HA Management, took over the operations of &quot;Advertiser&quot; while also overseeing the Star-Bulletin during a 30- to 60-day transition period, in which both papers merged into one daily, &quot;The Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot;. The merger took place on June 7, 2010. Existing Advertiser employment ceased. The &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; published its final issue as a tabloid on June 6, 2010 before returning to a broadsheet paper under the merger.

==Key dates==

*February 1, 1882: Henry Martyn Whitney, who had founded the &quot;Pacific Commercial Advertiser&quot; in 1856, began placing a &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot; in the window of James Robertson&#x27;s Honolulu waterfront stationery store. Robertson bought the concept from Whitney and hired him as editor.
*March 28, 1893: Two months after Queen Liliuokalani was overthrown, businessman Joseph Ballard Atherton founded the &quot;Hawaiian Star&quot; as a mouthpiece for the provisional government.
*July 4, 1894: The Republic of Hawaii was established, and Whitney&#x27;s successor as &quot;Advertiser&quot; editor was New Englander Wallace Rider Farrington. While Farrington edited the &quot;Advertiser&quot;, it was purchased by Lorrin Thurston. Disagreeing with &quot;Advertiser&quot; policies, Farrington became editor of the competing &quot;Daily Bulletin&quot;.
*July 1, 1912: The &quot;Hawaiian Star&quot; and &quot;Evening Bulletin&quot; merged to form the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;. Riley Allen became editor. Joseph Ballard Atherton and sons Charles H. and Frank Cooke became owners of the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot;, the latter becoming the first president. Wallace Farrington became vice president and general business manager.
*1925: The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; bought the &quot;Tribune-Herald&quot; in Hilo, operating it from afar until the Big Island paper was divested to Donrey Media in 1964.
*July 6, 1929: After Wallace Farrington completed eight years as territorial governor, Frank Cooke Atherton turned control of the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; over to Farrington, who was named president and publisher.
*December 7, 1941: On the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; published its most famous extra, as Editor Riley Allen and staff scrambled to print the first paper in the world with news of the assault. Extras were being sold on the street within three hours.
*November 3, 1942: Joseph Farrington, &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; president and general manager, was elected nonvoting Hawaii delegate to Congress. He was re-elected in 1944, 1946, 1948, 1950 and 1952.
*Bill Ewing, a &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; editor, was credited with creating the slang term &quot;SeaBee&quot; for the U.S. Navy&#x27;s construction battalions.
*October 24, 1944: Wartime martial law ended in Hawaii. The &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; strongly opposed martial law from its inception shortly after the Pearl Harbor attack.
*December 1, 1952: The &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot; partnered with radio man J. Howard Worrell to open KGMB-TV, Hawaii&#x27;s first television station, airing for the first time.
*April 17, 1953: In response to a statement by Mississippi&#x27;s Sen. James Eastland that Hawaii was dominated by Communists and would, if granted statehood, send representatives of Moscow to Congress, the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; devoted most of its front page, all of page 2 and part of page 3 to listing the names of Hawaii&#x27;s dead, wounded, missing and prisoners in the 1950–53 Korean War.
*March 9, 1957: &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; reporter Sarah Park, 29, died when a small plane piloted by Hawaii advertising executive Paul Beam crashed into the sea just off Laie Point while covering the tsunami arrival following the 1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake. Beam, 42, died less than 24 hours later. &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; photographer Jack Matsumoto survived the crash with injuries, eventually returning to work.
*1959: The &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; publishes its statehood editions. The picture of Chester Kahapea hawking statehood editions two days before his 13th birthday appears March 13. The picture, snapped by Murray Befeler of Photo Hawaii, is picked up by such newspapers as the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.
*July 22, 1960: Riley Allen steps down as editor after 48 years. &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; circulation during his career rose from about 4,000 in 1912 to 104,000 in 1960. He had overseen coverage of two of Hawaii&#x27;s biggest stories – the Pearl Harbor attack and statehood.
*1961: A &quot;hui&quot; including Chinn Ho, Joseph Ballard Atherton, Alexander Atherton, William H. Hill and John T. Waterhouse forms to buy the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; from the Farrington Estate.
*June 1, 1962: The &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; and its morning rival, the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;, set up a third company, the Hawaii Newspaper Agency, under a joint operating agreement to handle non-newsroom functions of both papers. The Sunday editions of both papers are combined.

*Jan. 7, 1993: Gannett announces it has reached an agreement to sell the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; to Rupert Phillips&#x27; Liberty Newspapers Limited Partnership in a move that will allow Gannett to complete its acquisition of the &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot;. &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; circulation is 88,000.
*March 18, 1996, the Star-Bulletin debuted http://starbulletin.com, the first regularly-published online newspaper in Hawaii. Webmaster Blaine Fergerstrom was hired March 3, 1996 from Milici Valenti Ng Pack Advertising as a staff artist and launched the site two weeks later. He published Monday–Friday editions, mostly solo, for two-and-a-half years. In 1999, the Honolulu Advertiser announced their competing online edition, thehonoluluadvertiser.com, and hired 12 people to staff their effort. The Star-Bulletin responded by doubling the size of the starbulletin.com staff, to two, by adding Assistant Webmaster Kenneth Andrade, who moved over from Assistant Editor of the Business Section of the paper. The online edition subsequently published seven days a week. starbulletin.com went on to receive major awards from Editor and Publisher Magazine, American Journalism Review, (which ranked starbulletin.com as 19th in the world behind the Christian Science Monitor and ahead of the Chicago Tribune), Hawaii Publishers Association, and the Arizona State University Cronkite School of Journalism, which awarded starbulletin.com with a &quot;Best of the West&quot; award in 2000 for the sites groundbreaking online video presentations.
*August 9, 1997: The &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; publishes the &quot;Broken Trust&quot; essay by five community leaders critical of Bishop Estate trustees.

*September 16, 1999: Liberty Newspapers announces it will shut down the &quot;Star-Bulletin&quot; on October 30 because of better investment opportunities on the mainland. Circulation is 67,124.

<text>Wilmot Reed Hastings Jr. (born October 8, 1960) is an American businessman. He is the co-founder and executive chairman of Netflix, Inc. (provider of the Netflix streaming service). Hastings serves on a number of boards and works with various non-profit organizations. A former president of the California State Board of Education, Hastings is also an advocate for charter schools.

As of January 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Hasting&#x27;s net worth at $5.5 billion.

==Early life==
Hastings was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His father Wilmot Reed Hastings Sr. was an attorney for the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in the Nixon administration, and his mother Joan Amory Loomis was a debutante from a Boston Brahmin family who was repulsed by the world of high society and taught her children to disdain it. His maternal great-grandfather was Alfred Lee Loomis.

Hastings attended Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and sold vacuum cleaners door-to-door in a gap year before entering college. In 1983, he graduated from Bowdoin College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Mathematics. Hastings found Bowdoin &quot;beautiful and engaging,&quot; and still remains engaged with the school.

He joined the Marine Corps officer training through their Platoon Leader Class, and spent college summers in the Marines, including a stint at the Officer Candidate School boot camp at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia in the summer of 1981. He did not complete the training and never commissioned into the Marine Corps—choosing instead to pursue service in the Peace Corps &quot;out of a combination of service and adventure&quot;. He went to teach math at a high school of around 800 students in rural northwest Swaziland from 1983 to 1985 after college. He credits part of his entrepreneurial spirit to his time in the Peace Corps, remarking that, &quot;Once you have hitchhiked across Africa with ten bucks in your pocket, starting a business doesn&#x27;t seem too intimidating.&quot;

After returning from the Peace Corps, Hastings went on to attend Stanford University after being rejected from his first choice MIT, graduating in 1988 with a Master&#x27;s Degree in Computer Science.

== Career ==

=== Founding of Pure Software ===
Hastings&#x27; first job was at Adaptive Technology, where he created a tool for debugging software. He met Audrey MacLean in 1990 when she was CEO at Adaptive Corp. In 2007, Hastings told CNN, &quot;From her, I learned the value of focus. I learned it is better to do one product well than two products in a mediocre way.&quot;

Hastings left Adaptive Technology in 1991 to lay the foundation to his first company, Pure Software, which produced products to troubleshoot software. The company&#x27;s growth proved challenging for Hastings, as he lacked managerial experience. He stated he had trouble managing with a rapid headcount growth. His engineering background didn&#x27;t prepare him for the challenges of being a CEO, and he asked his board to replace him, stating he was losing confidence. The board refused, and Hastings says he learned to be a businessman. Pure Software was taken public by Morgan Stanley in 1995.

In 1996, Pure Software announced a merger with Atria Software. The merger integrated Pure Software&#x27;s programs for detecting bugs in software with Atria&#x27;s tools to manage development of complex software. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that there were problems integrating the sales forces of Pure Software and Atria after the head salesmen for both Pure and Atria left following the merger.

In 1997, the combined company, Pure Atria, was acquired by Rational Software, which triggered a 42% drop in both companies&#x27; stocks after the deal was announced. Hastings was appointed Chief Technical Officer of the combined companies and left soon after the acquisition.

=== Founder of Netflix ===

In 1997, Hastings and former Pure Software employee Marc Randolph co-founded Netflix, offering flat rate movie rental-by-mail to customers in the US by combining two emerging technologies; DVDs, which were much easier to send as mail than VHS-cassettes, and a website from which to order them, instead of a paper catalogue. Headquartered in Los Gatos, California, Netflix has amassed a collection of 100,000 titles and more than 100 million subscribers. Hastings had the idea for Netflix after he left Pure Software. &quot;I had a big late fee for &quot;Apollo 13&quot;. It was six weeks late and I owed the video store $40. I had misplaced the cassette. It was all my fault. I didn&#x27;t want to tell my wife about it. And I said to myself, &quot;I&#x27;m going to compromise the integrity of my marriage over a late fee?&quot; Later, on my way to the gym, I realized they had a much better business model. You could pay $30 or $40 a month and work out as little or as much as you wanted.&quot; (Randolph later said that Hastings had invented the anecdote to explain Netflix&#x27;s subscription business model. Blockbuster reportedly ordered Hastings to stop telling the story, after not finding the transaction in its records.)

Hastings said that when he founded Netflix, he had no idea whether customers would use the service. He is a proponent of Internet television and sees it as the future. He credits YouTube for his shift in strategy for developing a video streaming service. Netflix launched a service in 2007 to stream movies and television shows to computers.

==== Netflix culture ====
As Netflix grew, the company was noticed for its innovative management practices—the results of the culture Hastings was exploring—called &quot;Freedom and Responsibility&quot;. Netflix reportedly offers mediocre employees large severance packages to ensure that employees are consistently working to further the company&#x27;s innovative environment. Netflix has eliminated sick and vacation time for employees, and instead allows them to manage their time off individually.

Hastings created an internal culture guide for Netflix by meeting with employees to discuss the company&#x27;s culture. In August 2009, Hastings posted this internal culture guide publicly online, and it eventually became a pre-employment screening tool that dissuaded incompatible people from applying.

In September 2020, Hastings and Erin Meyer co-authored a book on Netflix&#x27;s culture and management principles with interviews from current and former employees. &quot;No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention&quot; was a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, featured on year-end lists for publications such as NPR and &quot;The Economist&quot;. It was shortlisted for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award.

=== Other business ventures ===
Hastings was on the board of Microsoft from 2007 to 2012. He was also on the board of directors of Facebook, Inc. from June 2011 to May 2019. As of September 2016, Hastings was reported to own over $10 million of Facebook shares.

Hastings is the majority owner of Powder Mountain ski resort in Utah following his $100 million investment in 2023. That same year, he announced plans to turn half of the mountain Into a members-only ski club, in addition to other planned residential developments.

== Activism and philanthropy ==

=== Education ===

==== California State Board of Education ====
After selling Pure Software, Hastings found himself without a goal. He became interested in educational reform in California and enrolled in the Stanford Graduate School of Education. In 2000, Governor Gray Davis appointed Hastings to the State Board of Education, and in 2001, Hastings became its president. He spent $1 million of his own money together with $6 million from Silicon Valley venture capitalist John Doerr to promote the passage of Proposition 39 in November 2000, a measure that lowered the level of voter approval for local schools to pass construction bond issues from 66 to 55 percent.

In 2009, Hastings ran into trouble on the State Board of Education when Democratic legislators challenged his advocacy of more English instruction and language testing for non-English speaking students. The California Senate Rules Committee refused to confirm him as the board&#x27;s president. The California State Legislature rejected him in January 2005. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who had reappointed Hastings to the board after Hastings&#x27; first term, issued a statement saying he was &quot;disappointed&quot; in the committee&#x27;s action. Hastings resigned.

In April 2008, Steven Maviglio reported that Hastings had made a $100,000 contribution to California Governor Schwarzenegger&#x27;s &quot;Voters First&quot; redistricting campaign.

==== Charter schools ====
Hastings is active in educational philanthropy and politics. One of the issues he most strongly advocates is charter schools, publicly funded, privately-run elementary or secondary schools.

In July 2006, the &quot;Santa Cruz Sentinel&quot; reported that Hastings had donated $1 million to Beacon Education Network to open up new charter schools in Santa Cruz County, where he lives.

Hastings, as a Giving Pledge member since 2012, founded Hastings Fund and pledged $100 million to children&#x27;s education. In his post on Facebook, he said that the Hastings Fund &quot;will donate these funds in the best way possible for kids&#x27; education.&quot; Hastings Fund gave its first two gifts, totaling $1.5 million, to the United Negro College Fund and the Hispanic Foundation of Silicon Valley for college scholarships for black and Latino youth.

In March 2014, he argued for the elimination of elected school boards.

==== Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) ====
In June 2020, Hastings donated $120 million to be equally split among the United Negro College Fund, Morehouse College and Spelman College. It was the largest individual donation ever to support scholarships at HBCUs.

=== Donor-advised fund ===
Hastings opened a donor-advised fund at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2016 with a $100 million contribution. In 2024, he gifted two million of his Netflix shares worth $1.1 billion to the foundation.

=== Technology ===
In April 2004, Hastings authored a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed advocating the expensing of stock options.

=== Politics ===
In August 2007, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Hastings had donated $1 million to a committee formed to support California State Superintendent of Schools Jack O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s candidacy for Governor of California in 2010.

In April 2009, Hastings donated $251,491.03 to Budget Reform Now, a coalition supporting California Propositions 1A to 1F.

Hastings supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election.

In 2021, Hastings gave $3 million to defeat the campaign to recall Gavin Newsom as governor of California.

On July 3, 2024, Hastings called on Joe Biden to withdraw from the 2024 United States presidential election. On July 23, 2024, Hastings supported Kamala Harris for the presidential election and made a multimillion dollar donation to the Republican Accountability PAC, a super PAC supporting her campaign. It was his largest donation in support of a single candidate. 

== Personal life ==
Hastings lives in Santa Cruz, California. He is married to Patricia Ann Quillin and has two children.

Hastings appeared in a front-page article in &quot;USA Today&quot; in 1995, posing on his Porsche. Hastings eventually sold his Porsche for a Toyota Avalon, but drives a Tesla as of 2020.

In 2018, Hastings appeared in a podcast series by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, &quot;Masters of Scale&quot;, and discussed the strategy adopted by Netflix to scale.

In 2020, Hastings and his wife donated $30 million to GAVI to support COVAX COVID-19 vaccines initiative. That same year, Hastings made a $120 million gift to Morehouse College and Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia.

In March 2022, Hastings donated $1 million to Razom, a Ukrainian nonprofit organization that procures emergency supplies and medical equipment, such as disposable resuscitators to treat the wounded. In June 2022, Hastings delivered the commencement address at Stanford University.

<doc id="632423" wikidata="Q1077762" url="?curid=632423" title="Cainites">
<text>The Cainites or Cainians (, &quot;Kainoi&quot;, and , &quot;Kaianoi&quot;) were a Gnostic and antinomian sect known to venerate Cain as the first victim of the Demiurge, the deity of the Old Testament, who was identified by many groups of Gnostics as evil. The sect was relatively small. They were mentioned by Tertullian and Irenaeus as existing in the eastern Roman Empire during the 2nd century. One of their purported religious texts was the &quot;Gospel of Judas&quot;.

==History==
The oldest source is to be found in Irenaeus, .

===Cain and Abel===

Irenaeus states that the Cainites regarded Cain as derived from the highest God, not the Creator God worshipped by Jews and other Christians. According to Irenaeus, they claimed fellowship with Esau, Korah, the men of Sodom, and all such people, and regarded themselves as persecuted by the Creator. But they escaped injury from him, because they were protected by the goddess Sophia.

Epiphanius of Salamis (&quot;Haer&quot;. 38), who appears to have some source of information independent of Irenaeus, gives a much longer account. He describes Abel as being derived from the weaker principle.

===Redemption===
Like other Gnostics, the Cainites distinguished between the Creator and the Supreme God. They identified the Creator with the God of the Jews, viewing him and those he favored with hostility and believing that the purpose of redemption was the dissolution of his work. They claimed kinship with those to whom he showed antagonism in the Old Testament but believed he was the weaker power and could do them no permanent harm, since they enjoyed the protection of Sophia.

They may have shared with other heretical Christians a belief in the division of humanity into two classes: the spiritual and the material. Material people belonged to the realm of the Creator and derived their being from him but were doomed to destruction. Spiritual people were imprisoned in bodies of flesh but derived their essential being from the highest Power. They were opposed by the Creator and his minions but were destined to triumph over them as Cain did over Abel.

===Judas===

They regarded Judas the traitor as having full cognizance of the truth. He therefore, rather than the other disciples, was able to accomplish the mystery of the betrayal, and so bring about the dissolution of all things both celestial and terrestrial. The Cainites possessed a work entitled &quot;The Gospel of Judas,&quot; and Irenaeus says that he had himself collected writings of theirs, where they advocated that the work of Hystera should be dissolved. By Hystera they meant the Maker of Heaven and Earth.

There is no doubt that they applauded the action of Judas in the betrayal, but authorities differ as to the motive which prompted him. The view that Judas through his more perfect &quot;Gnosis&quot; penetrated the wish of Jesus more successfully than the others, and accomplished it by bringing him to the Cross through which he effected redemption, is only one of them.

Epiphanius also says that Judas forced the Archons, or rulers, against their will to slay Christ, and thus assisted us to the salvation of the Cross. Philaster, on the other hand, assigns the action of Judas to his knowledge that Christ intended to destroy the truth—a purpose which he frustrated by the betrayal.

===Transmigration===
So far as the moral character and conduct of the Cainites is concerned, there is no doubt that Irenaeus intended to represent them as shrinking from no vileness, but rather as deliberately practising it. He states that they taught, as did Carpocrates, that salvation could be attained only by passing through all experience. Whenever any sin or vile action was performed by them, they asserted that an angel was present whom they invoked, claiming that they were fulfilling his operation. Perfect knowledge consisted in going without a tremor into such actions as it is not lawful even to name.

Carpocrates, we are told, defended this practice by a theory of transmigration. It was necessary to pass through all experiences, and hence the soul had to pass from body to body till the whole range of experience had been traversed. If, however, this could all be crowded into a single lifetime, then the transmigration became unnecessary. Arthur S. Peake sees no ground to suppose that the Cainites held such a view, but they seem, in his opinion, to have professed the belief that this fullness of experience was essential to salvation. We have no substantial justification for asserting or doubting the truth of Irenaeus&#x27; account, though accusations of immorality urged against heretics should always be received with caution. G.R.S. Mead (&quot;Fragments of a Faith Forgotten&quot;, 1900, p. 229) thinks that originally they were ascetics, while N. Lardner (&quot;History of Heretics&quot;, bk. ii. ch. xiv. [= Works, 1829, viii. 560]) questions whether a sect guilty of such enormities ever existed. Arthur S. Peake, on the other hand, believes that there is no valid reason to deny the generally accepted view that the Gnostic attitude to matter did lead to quite opposite results. According to him, some Gnostics would infer from that attitude a duty to crush the flesh beneath the spirit by the severest austerity, but the premise might lead to a libertine as well as to an ascetic conclusion.

==Source texts on the Cainites==
* Irenaeus, &quot;Against Heresies&quot; 1.31.1–2
* Epiphanius of Salamis, &quot;Panarion&quot; 38
* Hippolytus, &quot;Against Heresies&quot; 8
* Pseudo-Tertullian, &quot;Against All Heresies&quot; 2
* Tertullian, &quot;On Baptism&quot; 1.

==In popular culture==
*The book &quot;Demian&quot;, by Hermann Hesse, extensively draws upon the beliefs of the &quot;Cainite&quot; sect. The eponymous character Max Demian even convinces the protagonist Emil Sinclair that Christianity had misunderstood Cain&#x27;s virtue over Abel&#x27;s.
*The sect is mentioned by Lucifer in &quot;The Sandman&quot; #22 when talking to Cain in Hell, noting &quot;no greater percentage of them turned up here than of any other religion&quot;.
*The sect is included as a dualist heresy in the computer game Crusader Kings 3.
*The Cainites are featured as antagonists in the Spanish HBO series &quot;30 Coins&quot;.
*In , the Cainites are re-imagined as a heretical vampire sect that persisted secretly into the Middle Ages.

<text>The Zygaenidae moths are a family of Lepidoptera. The majority of zygaenids are tropical, but they are nevertheless quite well represented in temperate regions. Some of the 1000 or so species are commonly known as burnet or forester moths, often qualified by the number of spots, although other families also have &#x27;foresters&#x27;. They are also sometimes called smoky moths.

All 43 species of Australian zygaenids are commonly known as foresters and belong to the tribe Artonini. The only nonendemic species in Australia is &quot;Palmartona catoxantha&quot;, a Southeast Asian pest species which is believed to be already present in Australia or likely to arrive soon.

==Description==

=== Larvae ===

Larvae are stout and may be flattened. A fleshy extension of the thorax covers the head. Most feed on herbaceous plants, but some are tree feeders. Larvae in two subfamilies, Chalcosiinae and Zygaeninae, have cavities in which they store the cyanide, and can excrete it as defensive droplets.

=== Aposematism in adults ===

Zygaenid moths are typically day flying with a slow, fluttering flight, and with rather clubbed antennae. They generally have a metallic sheen and often prominent spots of red or yellow. 
The bright colours are a warning to predators that the moths are distasteful - they contain hydrogen cyanide (HCN) throughout all stages of their life cycle. Unlike most insects with such toxins, they obtain glucosides from the plants they utilize so that HCN can be used as a defence. However, they are capable of making HCN themselves, and when in an environment poor in cyanide-producing plants, synthesize it themselves. They form mimicry complexes based on these toxins.
However, while the overall picture is of genuine aposematism – the insects are both conspicuously coloured and toxic, containing cyanogenic glucosides – a study by Emmanuelle Briolat and colleagues including Martin Stevens found no evidence of a quantitative relationship between the visual signals of different species of Zygaenidae and their toxicity.

== Evolution ==
The fossil species &quot;Neurosymploca? oligocenica&quot;, belonging to the subfamily Zygaeninae, is known from Lower Stampian (Early Oligocene) deposits in Céreste, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. Lepidopterans with preserved structural coloration from the Eocene (~47 Ma) shales of the Messel Pit, Germany, are suggested to be zygaenids, and more specifically procridines due to wing venation patterns.

<text>A rat king is a collection of rats or mice whose tails are intertwined and bound together in some way. This could be a result of an entangling material like hair, a sticky substance such as sap or gum, or the tails being tied together. 

A similar phenomenon with squirrels has been observed, which has had modern documented examples.

== Etymology ==
The original German term, , was calqued into English as &quot;rat king&quot;, and into French as . The term was not originally used in reference to actual rats, but for persons who lived off others. Conrad Gesner in (1551–58) stated: &quot;Some would have it that the rat waxes mighty in its old age and is fed by its young: this is called the rat king.&quot; Martin Luther stated: &quot;finally, there is the Pope, the king of rats right at the top.&quot; Later, the term referred to a king sitting on a throne of knotted tails.

An alternative theory states that the name in French was (or a spinning wheel of rats, the knotted tails being wheel spokes), with the term transforming over time into , because formerly French &quot;oi&quot; was pronounced or similar; nowadays it is pronounced .

== History ==
The earliest report of rat kings comes from 1564. Most extant examples are formed from black rats (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;).

Specimens of purported rat kings are kept in some museums. The museum Mauritianum in Altenburg, Thuringia, shows the largest well-known mummified &quot;rat king&quot;, which was found in 1828 in a miller&#x27;s fireplace at Buchheim. It consists of 32 rats. Alcohol-preserved rat kings are shown in museums in Hamburg, Göttingen, Hamelin, Stuttgart, Strasbourg, Tartu and Nantes.

A rat king found in 1930 in New Zealand, displayed in the Otago Museum in Dunedin, was composed of immature black rats whose tails were entangled by horse hair.

A rat king discovered in 1963 by a farmer at Rucphen, Netherlands, as published by cryptozoologist M. Schneider, consists of seven rats. All of them were killed by the time they were examined. X-ray images show formations of calluses at the fractures of their tails, which suggests that the animals survived for an extended period of time with their tails tangled.

Sightings of the phenomenon in modern times, especially where the specimens are alive, are very rare. One 2005 sighting comes from an Estonian farmer in Saru, of the Võrumaa region; many of the rats in the specimen, now part of the collection at the University of Tartu Museum of Zoology in Estonia, were alive. In 2021, a living &quot;rat king&quot; of five mice was caught on video (and untangled to save the mice) near Stavropol, Russia.

On 20 October 2021, a live rat king of 13 rats was found in Põlvamaa, Estonia. The rat king was taken to Tartu University and euthanized due to the rats having no way of freeing themselves. Before that, scientists were able to film the rat king alive. The rat king will be added to the Tartu University Museum of Zoology collection.

==Squirrel kings==
Instances of squirrel kings have been reported. They were found alive in some cases, and veterinarians have had to separate them as the squirrels could potentially starve or be eaten by a predator. A squirrel king of six squirrels stuck together with pine sap was found in Regina, Saskatchewan, in June 2013. In 2018, five juvenile grey squirrels were found in Wisconsin, US. Some surrounding nest material, grass, and plastic got further entangled with them. The knot caused some tissue damage to their tails.

== Possible explanations ==
Rat kings have been reported from Germany, Belgium (particularly in vicinity of the border with the Netherlands), Estonia, Indonesia (Java), and New Zealand, with the majority of cases reported from the European countries. The existence of this phenomenon is debated due to the limited evidence of it occurring naturally, although the discovery of a live instance in Estonia in 2021 is considered to be proof that it is a natural, albeit extremely rare, phenomenon. Another concern is the possibility that some of the centuries-old preserved museum specimens could be fabricated, such hoaxes being common in earlier eras. 17th–18th-century naturalists proposed many hypotheses to explain this phenomenon. Most were dubious, ranging from the rats getting stuck together during birth and glued later, to healthy rats deliberately knotting themselves to weaker rats to make a nest. A possible explanation is that the long flexible tail of the black rat could be exposed to sticky or frozen substances such as sebum (a secretion from the skin itself), sap, food, or excretory products. This mixture acts as a bonding agent and may solidify as rats sleep especially when the animals live in proximity during winter. After realizing that they were bound, they would struggle, tightening the knot. This explanation is plausible given that most cases have been found during winter and in confined spaces. Emma Burns, curator of natural science at the Otago Museum, said regarding her museum&#x27;s specimen, &quot;Ship rats [black rats], according to some theories, are climbing rats, so their tails have a grasping reflex. In the nest, they form a hold.&quot;

Some zoologists remain skeptical, saying that, while theoretically possible, the rats would not be able to survive in such a condition for a long time, particularly if the temperatures rose or if they bit their own or another&#x27;s tail to try to free themselves. Since black rats cluster together during winters for warmth, it could be possible for a rat king to be naturally-occurring. Any fabrications would most likely have been created using dead rats, given how difficult the process would be if the rats were alive. However, experts support the idea of isolated freak accidents due to the existence of occasional well-observed cases involving squirrels—also members of the rodent family. A 2007 study published in &quot;Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Science, Biology, and Ecology,&quot; following the finding of the University of Tartu specimen, concluded that the phenomenon is possible but rare.

==In popular culture==

Rat kings appear in novels such as &quot;It&quot; by Stephen King, &quot;Accordion Crimes&quot; by Annie Proulx, &quot;The Tale of One Bad Rat&quot; by Bryan Talbot, &quot;Ratking&quot; by Michael Dibdin, &quot;Rotters&quot; by Daniel Kraus, &quot;Peeps&quot; by Scott Westerfeld, &quot;The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray&quot; by Chris Wooding, &quot;Rats and Gargoyles&quot; by Mary Gentle, &quot;&quot; by Neil Cross, &quot;The War for the Lot&quot; by Sterling E. Lanier, &quot;Cold Storage&quot; by David Koepp, where it plays a prominent role, and &quot;The Rats&quot; by James Herbert. The Lorrie Moore short story &quot;Wings&quot; features a couple who discover a rat king in their attic. In Alan Moore and Ian Gibson&#x27;s comic book series &quot;The Ballad of Halo Jones&quot;, the Rat King was a weapon of war, a super-intelligent collective able to coordinate attacks by regular rats on a global scale, decimating an entire planet.

In &quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot; by Terry Pratchett, Keith skeptically notes that the filth associated with supposedly tying the rats together at a young age is not found in a rat&#x27;s nest. It is eventually revealed that members of the Ratcatchers&#x27; Guild create rat kings as a masterpiece to demonstrate their skill in handling live rats. The main antagonist of the novel, a rat king called Spider due to having eight component rats, is motivated by his grudge against humanity for his traumatic creation. In an author&#x27;s note at the end of the novel, Pratchett ventures the theory that &quot;down the ages, some cruel and inventive people have had altogether too much time on their hands&quot;.

E. T. A. Hoffmann&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker and the Mouse King&quot; features a character called the Mouse King (), with seven heads. The character is sometimes depicted as multi-headed in productions of the Tchaikovsky ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, based on the novella. The film &quot;The Nutcracker and the Four Realms&quot;, based on the short story, similarly features a &quot;Mouse King&quot;, a rat-king like creature formed from a teeming mass of small mice.

The phenomenon&#x27;s name appeared as the title of a Boston Manor song released in 2020. When asked about it, vocalist Henry Cox explained that he used the rat king as a metaphor for contemporary political and social events.

A creature known as the Rat King is featured in the 2020 action-adventure video game &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot;. It is a conjoinment of multiple fungus-infected humans, which protagonist Abby encounters in the underground levels of a hospital. Three actors were tied together to perform motion capture for the creature. Co-director Kurt Margenau described the idea behind the Rat King as the team&#x27;s take on &quot;what happens to them [the infected] when they sit around for a really long time.&quot;

The rat king appears in several episodes of the cartoon &quot;Hilda&quot;. The Rat King is an amalgamation of rats living in the sewers below the city. He knows people&#x27;s secrets and is willing to trade knowledge with Hilda on several occasions.

A three-head rat sovereign appears as the primary antagonist in Mac Barnett&#x27;s, graphic novel, &quot;The First Cat in Space Ate Pizza&quot;.

A rat king appears in &quot;Hoard&quot; by Luna Carmoon. A mass of rats is found among hoarded ephemera in Maria&#x27;s mother&#x27;s home.

A rat king appears in and is a main theme in “Ego Death “ by Jazz Emu where the protagonist creates a human/rat persona based on their obsession with the Rat King phenomena.

<doc id="632437" wikidata="Q478435" url="?curid=632437" title="Jim Craig (ice hockey)">
<text>James Downey Craig (born May 31, 1957) is an American former ice hockey goaltender who is best known for being part of the U.S. Olympic hockey team that won the gold medal at the 1980 Winter Olympics. Craig had a standout Olympic tournament, including stopping 36 of 39 shots on goal by the heavily favored Soviet Union in the &#x27;Miracle on Ice&#x27;, as the U.S. won 4–3, in what is widely considered one of the greatest upsets in sports history. Two days later, the U.S. defeated Finland, 4–2, to clinch Olympic gold. Craig went on to play professionally in the National Hockey League for the Atlanta Flames, Boston Bruins, and Minnesota North Stars from 1980 to 1983. He was inducted into IIHF Hall of Fame in 1999.

==Playing career==
===Amateur career===

After starring at Oliver Ames High School in his hometown, Craig spent one year at Massasoit Community College in Brockton, Massachusetts. He then transferred to Boston University, leading the Terriers to the NCAA Division I championship in 1978 and was an NCAA All-Star in 1979. He was inducted into the BU Hall of Fame in 1989.

===1980 Winter Olympics===
After Craig was selected to be the goaltender for the United States men&#x27;s national ice hockey team at the 1980 Winter Olympics, he wanted to live with a family during national team training, and chose to live with the team&#x27;s doctor, George Nagobads and his family.

Craig played a key role in one of the landmark moments in United States sports history, as the goalie for the United States in the Miracle on Ice, when the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team defeated the favored Soviet Olympic hockey team, which was led by veterans including greats Boris Mikhailov and Vladislav Tretiak. In that game, Craig stopped 36 of 39 shots from the Soviet team. His composure was evident in the final moments of the game and allowed the unheralded U.S. team to protect their one-goal lead and win 4–3. The American flag that Craig draped over his shoulders after the upset was displayed at the Sports Museum of America in New York City. Two days later, he led the U.S. to the gold medal in a 4–2 victory over Finland.

===Professional career===
Originally drafted by the Atlanta Flames with the 72nd pick in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft, Craig joined the Flames shortly after the Olympics and won his first game as an NHL player. However, he found it difficult to duplicate his magic in the NHL. The following season, the Boston Bruins brought him home to Massachusetts in a trade with Atlanta. He served as the Bruins&#x27; backup goaltender during the 1980-81 regular season but again failed to make an impression and he did not participate in the 1981 NHL Playoffs. Craig returned to the U.S. national team for the 1981 Canada Cup but missed the tournament due to injury and the following season was spent in the minor leagues with the Erie Blades. Craig&#x27;s final moment of glory was in 1983 when he again played very well for the United States in the 1983 IIHF Pool B tournament. Craig was named goaltender of the tournament and the Minnesota North Stars promptly signed him to a free agent contract. He would make a final three NHL appearances for the North Stars in 1984 before retiring from hockey.

==Personal life==
Two years after the Lake Placid victory, he was issued a citation charging him with &quot;driving to endanger after an accident on a rain-slicked highway that left one woman dead and another critically injured&quot;. Although neither alcohol nor drugs was a factor in the accident, the charge was later changed to motor vehicle homicide. He pleaded not guilty and waived his right to a jury trial, electing to go before a judge instead. He was found not guilty by a Wareham District Court judge in September 1982.

Craig is employed as a motivational speaker, spokesperson, marketing and sales strategist. He is president of Gold Medal Strategies, a Boston-area based promotions and marketing firm that also manages and represents Jim and his appearance business. For more than 30 years, Craig has provided strategic direction for employees and associates from more than 300 organizations.

His daughter Taylor is married to NHL player Jayson Megna.

Musician Dave Grohl has mentioned being an admirer of Craig over the years, as evidenced by the #6 entry of the &quot;47 Things You Might Not Know About Dave Grohl&quot; list on TeamRock.com, which stated, &quot;Dave’s first hero was Jim Craig, the 1980 American ice hockey team goalie from Easton, Massachusetts. After the team beat Russia, he found the phone numbers of all the Jim Craigs in that area, phoned them up and congratulated them. Dave and the real Jim Craig met years later at a Winter Olympics.&quot;

==In popular culture==
In the 1981 made-for-TV movie film &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot;, Craig is portrayed by Steve Guttenberg.

In the 2004 Disney film &quot;Miracle&quot;, he is portrayed by Eddie Cahill, who considers Craig to be one of his childhood heroes.

<text>Robert Kerr (20 October 1757 – 11 October 1813) was a Scottish surgeon, writer on scientific and other subjects, and translator.

==Life==
Kerr was born in 1757 in Bughtridge, Roxburghshire, the son of James Kerr, a jeweller, who served as MP for Edinburgh 1747–1754, and his wife Elizabeth. He was sent to the High School in Edinburgh.

He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and practised at the Edinburgh Foundling Hospital as a surgeon. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1788. His proposers were Alexander Fraser Tytler, James Russell and Andrew Dalzell. At this time, he lived at Foresters Wynd off the Royal Mile in Edinburgh.

He translated several scientific works into English, such as Antoine Lavoisier&#x27;s work of 1789, &quot;Traité Élémentaire de Chimie&quot;, published under the title &quot;Elements of Chemistry in a New Systematic Order containing All the Modern Discoveries&quot;, in 1790. In 1792, he published &quot;The Animal Kingdom&quot;, the first two volumes of a four-tome translation of Linnaeus&#x27; &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, which is often cited as the taxonomic authority for a great many species. (He never translated the remaining two volumes.)

In 1794, he left his post as a surgeon to manage a paper mill at Ayton in Berwickshire which he had purchased. He lost much of his fortune with this enterprise. Out of economical necessity he began writing again in 1809, publishing a variety of minor works, for instance a &quot;General View of the Agriculture of Berwickshire&quot;. His last work was a translation of Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;Recherches sur les ossements fossiles de quadrupedes&quot;, which was published after Kerr&#x27;s death under the title &quot;Essays on the Theory of the Earth&quot;.

His other works included a massive historical study entitled &quot;A General History and Collection of Voyages and Travels&quot; in eighteen volumes. Kerr began the series in 1811, dedicating it to Sir Alexander Cochrane, K.B., Vice-Admiral of the White. Publication did not cease following Kerr&#x27;s death in 1813; the latter volumes were published into the 1820s.

He died at home, Hope Park House, east of the Meadows in Edinburgh, where he had lived since 1810, and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in central Edinburgh against the eastern wall. His stone is added to a much earlier (1610) ornate stone monument. His son, David Wardrobe Kerr (1796–1815) lies with him.

<text>Pillnitz is a quarter in the east of Dresden, Germany. It can be reached by bus, ship, walking along the river or by bicycle. Pillnitz is most famous for its Baroque palace and park, the Pillnitz Castle.

Pillnitz Palace consists of the Riverside Palace (Wasserpalais) at the river, the parallel Upper Palace (Bergpalais) towards the hills and the linking building New Palace (Neues Palais). The first two were designed by Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann. The buildings frame the Baroque inner garden; this entire ensemble is surrounded by a park.

Pillnitz is known for the Declaration of Pillnitz of 1791: Emperor Leopold II and King Frederick William II of Prussia, urged by Charles X, then Comte d&#x27;Artois, declared that the French King Louis XVI was not to be harmed or deprived of power as a way to attack the progress of the French Revolution.

Pillnitz is also a site of wine production. During the millennium flood of 2002 in Dresden, it was one of the most affected areas.

<text>Enhanced Imaging System (EIS), officially referred to as &quot;Enhanced Imagery System&quot;, previously known as 8X, and sometimes unofficially known as Misty 2 and KH-13, is an American reconnaissance satellite program. A derivative of the Improved Crystal satellites, EIS replaced Misty, and was intended to provide more coverage and dwell time than previous reconnaissance satellites; like Misty, it has stealth capabilities. Only one EIS satellite has been launched; USA-144, which was placed into orbit by a Titan IVB rocket on 22 May 1999.

==History==
In 1995, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article reported that the 8X program was intended as &quot;a major upgrade to the KH-12&quot;, with a mass of as much as 20 tons, which would be used for detailed imaging with a wide field of view. The cost of the program was a subject of disagreement from some within the military at the time. By 1998, the program had been renamed Enhanced Imaging System. The Future Imagery Architecture program, which was intended to replace the Lacrosse and Improved Crystal satellites, was developed alongside EIS.

<doc id="632450" wikidata="Q503347" url="?curid=632450" title="Attack on Mers-el-Kébir">
<text>The attack on Mers-el-Kébir (Battle of Mers-el-Kébir) on 3 July 1940, during the Second World War, was a British naval attack on French Navy ships at the naval base at Mers El Kébir, near Oran, on the coast of French Algeria. The attack was the main part of Operation Catapult, a British plan to neutralise or destroy French ships to prevent them from falling into German hands after the Allied defeat in the Battle of France. The British bombardment of the base killed 1,297 French servicemen, sank a battleship and damaged five other ships, for a British loss of five aircraft shot down and two crewmen killed. The attack by air and sea was conducted by the Royal Navy, after France had signed armistices with Germany and Italy, coming into effect on 25 June.

Of particular significance to the British were the five battleships of the and es and the two fast battleships of the , the second largest force of capital ships in Europe after the Royal Navy. The British War Cabinet feared that the ships would fall into Axis hands. Admiral François Darlan, commander of the French Navy, assured the British, even after the French armistices with Germany and Italy that the fleet would remain under French control. Winston Churchill and the War Cabinet judged that the risk was too great. Darlan repeatedly refused British requests to place the fleet in British custody or move it to the French West Indies, out of German reach.

The British attack was condemned in France as an attack on a neutral nation and resentment festered for years over what was considered betrayal by a former ally. The French thought that their assurances were honourable and should have been sufficient. Marshal Philippe Pétain, who was appointed the Prime Minister of France on 16 June, severed diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom on 8 July.

French aircraft retaliated by bombing Gibraltar and French ships exchanged fire several times with British ships, before a truce was observed in the western Mediterranean. On 27 November 1942, after the beginning of Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, the French Navy foiled Case Anton, a German and Italian operation to capture its ships at Toulon, by scuttling them. In 1997, Martin Thomas wrote that the British attack at Mers-el Kébir remains controversial but that other historians have written that it demonstrated to the world that Britain would fight on.

==Background==
===French–German armistice===
After the Fall of France in 1940 and the armistice between France and Nazi Germany, the British War Cabinet was apprehensive about control over the French navy. The French and German navies combined could alter the balance of power at sea, threatening British imports over the Atlantic and communications with the rest of the British Empire. In Article 8, Paragraph 2 of the Armistice terms, the German government &quot;solemnly and firmly declared that it had no intention of making demands regarding the French fleet during the peace negotiations&quot; and there were similar terms in the armistice with Italy but they were considered by the British to be no guarantee of the neutralisation of the French fleet. On 24 June, Darlan assured Winston Churchill against such a possibility. Churchill ordered that a demand be made that the French Navy () should either join with the Royal Navy or be neutralised in a manner guaranteed to prevent the ships falling into Axis hands.
At Italian suggestion, the armistice terms were amended to permit the French fleet temporarily to stay in North African ports, where they might be seized by Italian troops from Libya. The British made a contingency plan, Operation Catapult, to eliminate the French fleet in mid-June, when it was clear that Philippe Pétain was forming a government with a view to ending the war and it seemed likely that the French fleet might be seized by the Germans. In a speech to Parliament, Churchill repeated that the Armistice of 22 June 1940 was a betrayal of the Allied agreement not to make a separate peace. Churchill said, &quot;What is the value of that? Ask half a dozen countries; what is the value of such a solemn assurance?... Finally, the armistice could be voided at any time on any pretext of non-observance&quot;.

The French fleet had seen little fighting during the Battle of France and was mostly intact. By tonnage, about 40 per cent was in Toulon, near Marseilles, 40 per cent in French North Africa and 20 per cent in Britain, Alexandria and the French West Indies. Although Churchill feared the fleet would be used by the Axis, the need to man, maintain and arm the French ships with items that were incompatible with German and Italian equipments made this unlikely. The and Benito Mussolini made overtures but Adolf Hitler feared that an attempted take-over would provoke the French fleet into defecting to the British. Churchill and Hitler viewed the fleet as a potential threat; the French leaders used the fleet (and the possibility of its rejoining the Allies) as a bargaining counter against the Germans to keep them out of unoccupied France (the ) and French North Africa. The armistice was contingent on the French right to man their vessels and the French Navy Minister, Admiral François Darlan, had ordered the Atlantic fleet to Toulon and to demobilise, with orders to scuttle the ships if the Germans tried to take them.

===British–French negotiations===
The British tried to persuade the French authorities in North Africa to continue the war or to hand over the fleet to British control. A British admiral visited Oran on 24 June, and Duff Cooper, Minister of Information, visited Casablanca on 27 June. The French Atlantic ports were in German hands and the British needed to keep the German surface fleet out of the Mediterranean, confine the Italian fleet to the Mediterranean and to blockade ports still under French control. The Admiralty was against an attack on the French fleet in case the ships were not sufficiently damaged, France declared war and the French colonies would be less likely to defect. The Royal Navy lacked the ships permanently to blockade the French naval bases in North Africa and keep the Atlantic approaches open, which made the risk of the Germans or the Italians seizing the French capital ships too great. Because the fleet in Toulon was well guarded by shore artillery, the Royal Navy decided to attack the base in North Africa.

==Ultimatum==

The most powerful group of French warships was commanded by Admiral Marcel-Bruno Gensoul at Mers-el-Kébir in French Algeria, comprising the old battleships (commander of the 2nd Battleship Division, Rear-Admiral , embarked) and (Captain ), the newer &quot;Force de Raid&quot; battleships (Captain ) and (Captain ), the seaplane tender (Captain Lemaire), a flotilla of six destroyers comprising &quot;Mogador&quot;, &quot;Volta&quot;, &quot;Tigre&quot;, &quot;Lynx&quot;, &quot;Kersaint&quot; and &quot;Le Terrible&quot; (Rear-Admiral ) and a gunboat (). Admiral James Somerville, commander of Force H, based in Gibraltar, was ordered to deliver an ultimatum to the French, the terms of which were contrary to the German–French armistice.

Somerville passed the duty of presenting the ultimatum to a French speaker, Captain Cedric Holland, commander of the carrier . Gensoul was affronted that negotiations were being conducted by a less-senior officer and sent his lieutenant, Bernard Dufay, which led to much delay and confusion. As the negotiations continued, it became clear that agreement was unlikely. The French made preparations for action and 42 aircraft were armed and made ready for take-off. Darlan was at home on 3 July and could not be contacted; Gensoul told the French government that the alternatives were internment or battle but omitted the option of sailing to the French West Indies. Removing the fleet to US waters had formed part of the orders given by Darlan to Gensoul in the event that a foreign power should attempt to seize his ships.

==Operation Catapult==

===Plymouth, Portsmouth and Alexandria===

Along with French vessels in metropolitan ports, some had sailed to ports in Britain or to Alexandria in Egypt. Operation Catapult was an attempt to take these ships under British control or destroy them. The French ships berthed in Plymouth and Portsmouth were boarded without warning on the night of 3 July. The submarine , the largest in the world, had been at Plymouth for the last month. The crew resisted a boarding party and three Royal Navy personnel, including two officers, were killed, along with a French sailor. Other ships captured included the old battleships and , the destroyers and , eight torpedo boats, five submarines and a number of lesser ships. The French squadron in Alexandria (Admiral René-Émile Godfroy) including the battleship , the heavy cruiser and three modern light cruisers, was neutralised by local agreement.

===Attack on Mers-el-Kébir===
The British force comprised the battlecruiser , the battleships and , the aircraft carrier &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and an escort of cruisers and destroyers. The British had freedom of manoeuvre, while the French fleet was anchored in a narrow harbour, its crews not expecting an attack. The British capital ships had guns and fired a heavier broadside than the French battleships. On 3 July, before negotiations were formally terminated, six British Fairey Swordfish planes escorted by three Blackburn Skuas from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; dropped five magnetic mines in the harbour exit. The force was intercepted by five French Curtiss H-75 fighters which shot down a Skua into the sea with the loss of its two crew, the only British fatalities in the action.

The six s at Algiers were summoned but did not reach Mers-El-Kebir in time. The Préfet Maritime at Toulon ordered two submarine flotillas, consisting of , and and , comprising &quot;Iris&quot;, &quot;Vénus&quot;, &quot;Sultane&quot;, &quot;Sirène&quot;, &quot;Pallas&quot; and &quot;Cérès&quot;, to assist the French at Oran by attacking British ships, &quot;Hood&quot; in particular. After receiving orders on 3 July to form a north–south patrol line in the Mediterranean for a distance of east of Alboran Island and south of Cape Palos during the night of 6/7 July, to protect Oran and attack British ships, the French submarines &quot;Archimède&quot;, &quot;Le Conquérant&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Espoir&quot; got underway from Toulon at on 4 July bound for their patrol area at . No contacts were made and the boats were recalled on 5 July when it was discovered that the British ships had returned to Gibraltar. Gensoul ordered the four submarines at Oran, , , and to take post off the port. The orders to the four French submarines were quickly decoded and London ordered Somerville to act; the boats were unable to close with Force H. Churchill ordered the British ships to open fire at the same time and the British commenced at from .
&quot;Provence&quot; began its reply within 90 seconds of the British opening fire but the main armament of &quot;Dunkerque&quot; and &quot;Strasbourg&quot; was forward of the superstructure and could not immediately be brought to bear because they were tied up at the mole, with their sterns facing the sea. The third British salvo hit &quot;Bretagne&quot; and detonated a magazine, the ship sinking with 977 of her crew at After thirty salvoes, the French ships ceased fire; Force H altered course to avoid return fire from the French coastal forts but &quot;Provence&quot; was badly damaged by several hits, &quot;Dunkerque&quot; was hit by three shells, severely damaged and run aground to avoid sinking, the destroyer lost its stern and two other destroyers were damaged; their crews ran them aground to prevent them from sinking. Four French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters arrived, outnumbering the British Skuas. Another nine French fighters were spotted at and a dogfight ensued in which a Curtiss H-75 and an M.S.406 were damaged. Three more Curtiss fighters appeared and there was another engagement.
&quot;Strasbourg&quot;, three destroyers and one gunboat managed to avoid the mines and escape from the port under attack from a flight of Swordfish bombers from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. The French ships shot down two Swordfish, the crews being rescued by the destroyer ; a French flying boat also bombed a British destroyer. As the British bombing had little effect, at Somerville ordered his ships to pursue. &quot;Rigault de Genouilly&quot;, en route to Oran, met Force H at and steamed towards &quot;Hood&quot;, only to come under fire from the light cruisers and at respectively. &quot;Hood&quot; also fired several 15-inch shells at &quot;Rigault de Genouilly&quot; and the French ship replied with nineteen shells before being hit by &quot;Enterprise&quot; and withdrawing. A British aircraft had sighted &quot;Danaé&quot; and &quot;Eurydice&quot; shortly before 8:00 p.m. and dropped illuminated floats to guide a British destroyer to them. The destroyer depth-charged the two submarines but they escaped without damage.

&quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot; fell behind &quot;Hood&quot;. Somerville had received information that the French naval force from Algiers, four heavy cruisers, four light cruisers and several destroyers, was steering to rendezvous with &quot;Strasbourg&quot;. Without &quot;Valiant&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot;, Somerville concluded that by the time his ships came within gunnery range of &quot;Strasbourg&quot;, shortly after he would be outnumbered by the combined French force and ill deployed for a night engagement, silhouetted against the evening twilight, giving an advantage to the French gunners. At , when &quot;Hood&quot; had closed to from &quot;Strasbourg&quot;, Somerville called off the pursuit. After another ineffective Swordfish attack at &quot;Strasbourg&quot; reached Toulon on 4 July. The French cruiser force from Algiers missed its rendezvous with &quot;Strasbourg&quot; but arrived at Toulon on 4 July. During the night of 3/4 July 1940, &quot;Ariane&quot;, &quot;Danaé&quot;, &quot;Diane&quot; and &quot;Eurydice&quot; patrolled on the surface off Oran in a north–south patrol line and they remained on patrol off Oran until 8:00 p.m. on 4 July, before returning to Oran. On 4 July, the British submarine encountered &quot;Rigault de Genouilly&quot; off the Algerian coast, mistook her for a cruiser and sank her. The French Air Force () made reprisal raids on Gibraltar, including a small night attack on 5 July, when many bombs landed in the sea.

===Actions of 8 July===

The British believed that the damage inflicted on &quot;Dunkerque&quot; and &quot;Provence&quot; was not serious and on the morning of 8 July raided Mers-el-Kébir again in Operation Lever, with Swordfish aircraft from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. A torpedo hit the patrol boat &quot;Terre-Neuve&quot;, moored alongside &quot;Dunkerque&quot;, full of depth charges. &quot;Terre-Neuve&quot; quickly sank and the depth charges went off, causing serious damage to the battleship. Another attack took place on 8 July, when aircraft from the carrier attacked the &quot;Richelieu&quot; at Dakar, seriously damaging it. When word of the events at Dakar reached Oran, the French submarines &quot;Ariane&quot;, &quot;Diane&quot;, and &quot;Eurydice&quot; got back underway on 8 July to form a patrol line off Cape Falcon, Algeria, in case of another British attack on Oran, which did not occur.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===
Churchill wrote, &quot;This was the most hateful decision, the most unnatural and painful in which I have ever been concerned.&quot; Relations between Britain and France were severely strained for some time and the Germans enjoyed a propaganda coup. Somerville said that it was &quot;the biggest political blunder of modern times and will rouse the whole world against us... we all feel thoroughly ashamed&quot;. The attack revived Anglophobia in France, demonstrated British resolve to continue the war and rallied the British Conservative Party around Churchill (Neville Chamberlain, Churchill&#x27;s predecessor as prime minister, was still party leader). The British action showed the world that defeat in France had not reduced the determination of the government to fight on and ambassadors in Mediterranean countries reported favourable reactions.

The French ships in Alexandria under the command of Admiral René-Emile Godfroy, including the old battleship &quot;Lorraine&quot; and four cruisers, were blockaded by the British on 3 July and offered the same terms as at Mers-el-Kébir. After delicate negotiations, conducted on the part of the British by Admiral Andrew Cunningham, Godfroy agreed on 7 July to disarm his fleet and stay in port until the end of the war. Some sailors joined the Free French while others were repatriated to France; the ships at Alexandria went on to be used by the Free French after May 1943. The British attacks on French vessels in port increased tension between Churchill and Charles de Gaulle, who was recognised by the British as the leader of the Free French Forces on 28 June 1940.

Eric Seal, Churchill&#x27;s principal private secretary, wrote &quot;[Churchill] was convinced that the Americans were impressed by ruthlessness in dealing with a ruthless foe; and in his mind the American reaction to our attack on the French fleet in Oran was of the first importance&quot;. On 4 July, Roosevelt told the French ambassador that he would have done the same. Jean Lacouture, in a biography of De Gaulle, blamed the tragedy mainly on miscommunication; if Darlan had been in contact on the day or if Somerville had possessed a more diplomatic character, a deal might have been done. Lacouture accepted that there was a danger that the French ships might have been captured by German or more likely Italian troops, given the ease with which the British seized French ships in British ports or the Germans seized French ships in Bizerte in Tunisia in November 1942.

In 2004, David Brown wrote that foreign opinion was generally favourable to Operation Catapult and that the demonstration of British determination had succeeded. In 2010, Colin Smith wrote that the attack was the first big triumph of Churchill&#x27;s premiership and that they had been received favourably by the governments of the US, Turkey, Greece and Brazil, with condemnation from Spain and Switzerland. Count Galeazzo Ciano, the Italian foreign minister, made a diary entry that the Royal Navy retained the &quot;ruthlessness of the captains and pirates of the C16th&quot;.

In 2015, George Melton offered a dissenting opinion, and argued that much of the historiography of the attack represented a &quot;Churchillian perspective&quot; that ignored how the British attack on Mers el-Kébir had been a &quot;tactical failure&quot;. Melton wrote that the attack was unnecessary, because the French Navy had pledged and planned to scuttle its ships as a matter of honour rather than see them fall into German or Italian hands. The results of the attack were the opposite of what the British intended because it had sunk or put out of action very little of the French fleet, rather than ensure that the fleet was neutralised; prompted French ships that had been dispersed to remote bases in French North Africa, where they were beyond the reach of the Axis, to concentrate at Toulon, where they formed a powerful striking force and were in far greater danger of seizure by Axis forces. The attack united the French Navy and French people in hostility to the British.

The British lost access to the French Empire and French leaders other than Charles de Gaulle and an undeclared Anglo-French conflict over the next few months made the British strategic situation worse. Melton called it a &quot;myth&quot; that the attack had demonstrated British resolve to the United States, something British decision-makers did not discuss prior to the attack and which he wrote could have been more convincingly achieved through an attack on the Italian fleet or a large bombing raid against Germany. Melton suggested that Churchill&#x27;s anger at France for its capitulation to the Axis and his &quot;obsession&quot; with seizing or sinking the four modern French battleships (&quot;Jean Bart&quot;, &quot;Richelieu&quot;, &quot;Dunkerque&quot;, and &quot;Strasbourg&quot;) was largely responsible for the attack.

In an official &quot;Navy News&quot; magazine in 1990, an attack on Mers-el-Kébir was described as &quot;one of the most distasteful acts the Royal Navy has ever had to perform&quot;.

===Casualties===

===Subsequent events===

====British–Vichy hostilities====
Following the 3 July operation, Darlan ordered the French fleet to attack Royal Navy ships wherever possible; Pétain and his foreign minister Paul Baudouin over-ruled the order the next day. Military retaliation was conducted by ineffective air raids on Gibraltar but Baudouin noted, &quot;the attack on our fleet is one thing, war is another&quot;. As sceptics had warned, there were also complications with the French empire; when French colonial forces defeated de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces at the Battle of Dakar in September 1940, Germany responded by permitting Vichy France to maintain its remaining ships armed, rather than demobilised. On 24 September Gibraltar was bombed by sixty Vichy French aircraft which dropped of bombs and that night, another 81 bombers dropped of bombs. The French 2nd Destroyer Division comprising , , and had sailed from Casablanca on 24 September and in the early hours of 25 September encountered the destroyer patrolling off Gibraltar. &quot;Épée&quot; opened fire but its guns broke down after firing fourteen shells, &quot;Fleuret&quot; did not open fire because it could not get on target and the other French destroyers fired six shots between them. &quot;Hotspur&quot; returned fire but this was not reported by the French ships.

On 27 September Force H stayed at sea after receiving &quot;a charming message [that] the whole of the Toulon fleet was coming out to have a scrap with us&quot; but the two navies adhered to a tacit understanding that the British did not attack more powerful French forces at sea or ships in port but intercepted other French ships,

In the autumn, the French sent a convoy through the Strait of Gibraltar untroubled, a state of affairs that rarely changed during the Mediterranean Campaign.

====Gibraltarian civilians====

In early June 1940, about 13,500 civilians had been evacuated from Gibraltar to Casablanca in French Morocco. Following the capitulation of the French to the Germans and the attack on Mers-el-Kébir, the Vichy government found their presence an embarrassment. Later in June, 15 British cargo vessels arrived in Casablanca under Commodore Crichton, repatriating 15,000 French servicemen who had been rescued from Dunkirk. Once the French troops had disembarked, the ships were interned until the Commodore agreed to take away the evacuees, who, reflecting tensions generated after the attack on Mers-el-Kébir, were escorted to the ships at bayonet point, minus many of their possessions.

====Case Anton====

On 19 November 1942, the Germans tried to capture the French fleet based at Toulon, against the armistice terms, as part of Case Anton, the military occupation of Vichy France by Germany. All ships of any military value were scuttled by the French before the arrival of German troops, notably &quot;Dunkerque&quot;, &quot;Strasbourg&quot; and seven (four heavy and three light) modern cruisers. For many in the French Navy this was a final proof that there had never been a question of their ships ending up in German hands and that the British action at Mers-el-Kébir had been unnecessary. Darlan was true to his promise in 1940, that French ships would not be allowed to fall into German hands. Godfroy, still in command of the French ships neutralised at Alexandria, remained aloof for a while longer but on 17 May 1943 joined the Allies.

<text>; AEG) was a German producer of electrical equipment. It was established in 1883 by Emil Rathenau as the &quot;Deutsche Edison-Gesellschaft für angewandte Elektricität&quot; in Berlin.

The company&#x27;s initial focus was driven by electrical lighting, as in 1881, Rathenau had acquired the rights to the electric light bulb at the International Exposition of Electricity in Paris. Using small power stations, his company introduced electrical lighting to cafés, restaurants, and theaters, despite the high costs and limitations. By the end of the 19th century, AEG had constructed 248 power stations, providing a total of 210,000 hp of electricity for lighting, tramways, and household devices.

During the Second World War, AEG worked with the Nazi Party and benefited from forced labour from concentration camps. After the war, its headquarters moved to Frankfurt am Main.

In 1967, AEG joined with its subsidiary Telefunken AG, creating &quot;Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft AEG-Telefunken&quot;. In 1985, Daimler-Benz purchased the &quot;AEG-Telefunken Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (which was renamed to &quot;AEG Aktiengesellschaft&quot;) and wholly integrated the company in 1996 into Daimler-Benz AG (1998: DaimlerChrysler). The remains of AEG became part of Adtranz (later Bombardier Transportation) and Deutsche Aerospace (1998: DASA, today part of Airbus SE).

After acquiring the AEG household subsidiary AEG Hausgeräte GmbH in 1994, Electrolux obtained the rights to the AEG brand name in 2005, which it now uses on some of its products. The AEG name is also licensed to various brand partners under the Electrolux Global Brand Licensing program.

==History==

===Summary===

In 1883, Emil Rathenau founded &quot;Deutsche Edison-Gesellschaft für angewandte Elektricität&quot; in Berlin. In 1888, it was renamed as &quot;Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft&quot;. Initially producing electrical equipment (such as light bulbs, motors and generators), the company soon became involved in AC electric transmission systems. In 1907, Peter Behrens was appointed as artistic consultant to AEG. This led to the creation of the company&#x27;s initial corporate identity, with products and advertising sharing common design features.

The company expanded in the first half of the 20th century, and it is credited with a number of firsts and inventions in electrical engineering. During the same period, it entered the automobile and airplane markets. Electrical equipment for railways was produced during this time, beginning a long history of supplying the German railways with electrical equipment. According to the 1930 &quot;Encyclopedia Britannica&quot;: &quot;Prior to 1923 it was the largest electrical manufacturing concern in Germany and one of the most important industrial undertakings in the world.&quot;

During the Second World War, AEG joined with other large companies such as IG Farben, Thyssen and Krupp in their support of the Nazis. The company benefited from the use of large numbers of forced labourers as well as concentration camp prisoners, under inhuman conditions of work.

After WWII, the company lost its businesses in the eastern part of Germany. After a merger in 1967, the company was renamed &quot;Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft AEG-Telefunken&quot; (from 1979 on only &quot;AEG-Telefunken&quot;). The company experienced financial difficulties during the 1970s, resulting in the sale of some assets. In 1983, the consumer electronics division &quot;Telefunken Fernseh und Rundfunk GmbH&quot; was sold. In 1985, the company re-took the name AEG and the remainder of the company was acquired by Daimler-Benz; the parts that remained were primarily related to electric power distribution and electric motor technology. Under Daimler-Benz ownership, the former AEG companies eventually became part of the newly named Adtranz in 1995, and the AEG name was no longer used. Electrolux, which had already acquired the household subsidiary AEG Hausgeräte GmbH in 1994, now own the rights to use and license the AEG brand.

===Foundation to 1940===

The company originated in 1882, when Emil Rathenau acquired licences to use some of Thomas Edison&#x27;s lamp patents in Germany. The Deutsche Edison Gesellschaft (&quot;German Edison Company&quot;) was founded in 1883 with the financial backing of banks and private individuals, with Emil Rathenau as company director.

In 1884, Munich-born engineer Oskar von Miller (who later founded Deutsches Museum) joined the executive board. The same year, the company entered negotiations with the Berlin &quot;Magistrat&quot; (the municipal body) to supply electricity to a large area from a central supply, which resulted in the formation of the &quot;Städtischen Elektrizitätswerke&quot; (A.G.StEW) (&quot;City electricity works company (Berlin)&quot;) on 8 May 1884.

The original factory was located near Stettiner Bahnhof. In 1887 the company acquired land in the Berlin-Gesundbrunnen area on which the &quot;Weddingsche Maschinenfabrik&quot; (founded by Wilhelm Wedding) was previously located. In the same year, in addition to a restructuring and expansion of the production range, the AEG name was adopted.

In 1887 Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrowolsky joined the company as chief engineer, later becoming vice-director. His work on polyphase electric power led him to become the world&#x27;s leading engineer in three-phase electric power systems at the end of the 1880s.

In 1891 Miller and Dobrovolski demonstrated the transmission of electrical power over a distance of from a hydro electric power plant in Lauffen am Neckar to Frankfurt, where it lit 1000 light bulbs and drove an artificial waterfall at the International Electrotechnical Exhibition in Frankfurt am Main. This success marked one of beginnings of the general use of alternating current for electrification in Germany, and showed that distance transmission of electric power could be economically useful. In the same year the &quot;Stadtbahn Halle/Saale&quot; (City railway Halle–Saale) opened the first electric tram system (of notable size) in Germany.

Tropp Paul began his work for the AEG 1889/90 until 1893, and Franz Schwechten designed the facades of the &quot;Acker- und Hussitenstraße&quot; in 1894–95.

In 1894 the site of the former &quot;Berlin Viehmarktgasse&quot; (cattle market alley) was purchased. This had a railroad siding connecting to the Berlin rail network, but there was no rail connection between the two plants. In 1895 an underground railway link between the two plots was built in a tunnel 270 meters long. The tunnel was built by Siemens &amp; Halske (S &amp; H) (later to become Siemens) under the direction of C. Schwebel and Wilhelm Lauter who were also connected in the building of what is now the Spree tunnel Stralau used by the U-Bahn.

By 1889 AEG were known as specialists in the construction of industrial portable drilling machines, some of these were driven by flexible shafts from electric motors. AEG also developed a toothed belt drive to reduce motor speed down to that required by machine tools.

In 1903 the competing radio companies AEG and &quot;Siemens &amp; Halske&quot; merged, forming a joint subsidiary named Telefunken.

In 1907 architect Peter Behrens became an artistic adviser. Responsible for the design of all products, advertising and architecture, he has since become considered as the world&#x27;s first corporate designer. Behren&#x27;s philosophy was to create a building which is solid, strong and simple in its structure. It is perfect for doing its job of producing large, heavy machinery. The dimensions of the building were chosen to allow turbines to be transported above other machinery.

In the 1920s AEG became a global supplier of electrical know-how and equipment. In 1923, for example, it provided most of the essential materials and a team of engineers to oversee the electrification of British-ruled Palestine. British firms, at the time, could not compete with the prices of AEG 
The activity of the company soon extended to all areas of electrical power engineering, including electric lighting, electric power, electric railways, electro-chemical plants, as well as the construction of steam turbines, automobiles, cables and cable materials. In the first decades, the company had many factories in and around Berlin:
*&quot;Maschinenfabrik Brunnenstrasse&quot; (steam turbines, dynamos, electric motors)
*&quot;Apparatewerk Ackerstrasse&quot; (carbon-filament and metal thread light bulbs, Nernst lamps, switches, fuses, resistors, electrical measuring equipment, dynamos, electric motors)
*&quot;Kabelwerk Oberspree&quot; (KWO, cables, copper and metal works, rubber fabrication, insulator fabrication)
*&quot;Transformatorenwerk Oberspree&quot; (TRO, transformers)
*&quot;Glühlampenfabrik Moabit&quot; (1907–1912, carbon-filament and metal thread light bulbs, Nernst lamps, Vacuum tubes) — later became part of Osram, from 1939 on Telefunken
*&quot;Turbinenfabrik&quot; (1909, steam turbines) — famous as an example of industrial architecture
*&quot;Apparate-Werke Treptow &quot; (AT - 1926, arc lamps, switches, fuses, controls, starters, electrical measuring equipment)

A number of other notable events involving AEG occurred in this period:
*1900: Invention of the hairdryer.
*1901: The Neue Automobil Gesellschaft (&quot;New Automotive Company&quot;) became part of AEG through the takeover of &quot;Allgemeine Automobil-Gesellschaft&quot;
*27 October 1903: An AEG-equipped experimental three-phase railcar achieved a speed of on the test track of the &quot;Königlich Preußische Militär-Eisenbahn&quot; (Royal Prussian Military Railway) between Marienfelde and Zossen. This world speed record for rail vehicles was held until 1931.
*1904: Merger of AEG with the &quot;Union-Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft&quot; (UEG) (literal: Union-electricity Company)
*1910: Factory Hennigsdorf. Entry into the aircraft building market.
*1929: AEG produced its first compressor-driven refrigerators and temperature controlled irons.
*1933: AEG joined other large manufacturing companies to support Adolf Hitler
*1935: Presentation of the world&#x27;s first tape device Magnetophon K1 based on work by Eduard Schüller at the Berlin Radio Show
*1941: AEG bought Siemens &amp; Halske shares in Telefunken and the company became a subsidiary.

On 20 June 1915, founder Emil Rathenau died at age 77.

===The Nazi era and World War II===

AEG donated 60,000 Reichsmarks to the Nazi party after the Secret Meeting of 20 February 1933 at which the twin goals of complete power and national rearmament were explained by Hitler. They joined with other large companies, such as IG Farben, Thyssen and Krupp, in their support of the Nazis, especially in promoting re-armament of the Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe, and Kriegsmarine. During the war itself, they were to use large numbers of forced labourers as well as concentration camp prisoners, under inhuman conditions of work.

AEG worked extensively with the Nazi party in Poland. AEG was forced to relinquish Kabelwerk Krakow, a cable manufacturing plant, to the Nazi party. Kabelwerk Krakow was located in Krakow-Plaszow and used forced Jewish labor manufacturing cables from 1942 to 1944. In 1943, AEG began to relocate goods and evacuate workers. Goods were relocated to various places, including Berlin and Sudetenland. When installing electric and lighting systems for the Waffen-SS training grounds in Dębica, AEG used forced labor from Jews placed in the Pustkow labor camp located in south east Poland.

During World War II, an AEG factory near Riga used female slave labour. AEG was also contracted for the production of electrical equipment at Auschwitz concentration camp.

AEG used slave labour from Camp No. 36 at the new sub-camp of Auschwitz III and also known as Monowitz, called &quot;Arbeitslager Blechhammer&quot;. Most of them would die in 1945 during the death marches and finally in Buchenwald.

AEG was a major supplier of grips for P38 pistols manufactured by Walther Arms, Mauser, as well as on the early wartime Spreewerk P38s.

In an effort to express regret for its use of Jewish slave labour in World War II, AEG joined with Rheinmetall, Siemens, Krupp, and I G Farben to pay DEM75 million in reparations to the Jewish Claims Conference.

===1945 to 1970===
In 1945, after the Second World War, the production in the factories in the western sectors of Berlin - what today is the building of the headquarters of DW (TV)Deutsche Welle - and Nuremberg, Stuttgart and Mulheim an der Ruhr resumed and further new works were erected, among others an Electric meter plant in Hameln.

The steam and electric locomotive plant in Hennigsdorf (&quot;Fabriken Hennigsdorf&quot;) became a &quot;Volkseigener Betrieb&quot; (VEB) (people owned enterprise) as the &quot;Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke&quot; (LEW) (&quot;electric locomotive works&quot;). The cable plant (&quot;Draht-, Kabel- und Metallwerk Oberspree&quot;) and apparatus factory (&quot;Apparatefabrik Treptow&quot;) and other facilities also lay in East Germany and became &quot;Sowjetische Aktiengesellschaft&quot; (SAG) (Soviet joint stock companies). Over 90% of assets in Berlin lay in the Russian occupied zone and were lost.

The headquarters for the non-expropriated parts of the company was moved first to Hamburg and then finally to Frankfurt am Main, the headquarters in Berlin having been destroyed.

*1948: The AEG factories Kassel (FK) were founded on the site of the former MWK Motorenbau Werk Kassel at Lilienthalstrasse 150 in Kassel/Hesse/Germany. The first factory part was the high voltage switchgear factory (HSF), later the refrigerator factory (KSF), the ticketprinter factory (FDF), the isolating material factory (IF) as well as the worldwide accepted high voltage institute (HI)were founded. In the early sixties more than 5000 people worked for AEG in Kassel. Today, the site Lilienthalstrasse still produces high voltage switchgear.
*1950: The new corporate headquarters is at the &quot;Friedensbrücke&quot; (Peace Bridge) in Frankfurt / Main. The number of employees in the Group rose from 20,900 in September 1948 to 55,400 persons in September 1957. In the same year the turnover exceeded one billion DM for the first time, however the high level of investment in the rebuilding of the company (1948 to 1956 over 500 million DM) placed a considerable strain on the balance sheet.
*1958: The slogan &quot;Aus Erfahrung Gut&quot; (benefit from experience) is introduced to explain the company name and acronym, leading to unflattering parodies such as &quot;Auspacken, Einschalten, Geht nicht&quot; (unpack, switch on, does not work) or &quot;Alles Ein Gammel&quot; (everything is &#x27;&#x27;).
*1962: The Group has 127,000 employees and generates annual sales of 3.1 billion DM. In Springe a new factory is opened in February 1962 a new factory for the production of fluid control units with 200 employees.
*1962: Walter Bruch at Telefunken in Hannover develops PAL color television.
*1966: The largest industrial space in Europe is created (175 m long, 45 m wide and 26 m high) for the construction using cranes of engines and generators with weights up to 400 tonnes. Robert F. Kennedy attends the opening.
*1 January 1967: Merger with Telefunken creates AEG-Telefunken, headquartered in Frankfurt am Main.

===1970s onwards===

In 1970, AEG-Telefunken had 178,000 employees worldwide, and was the 12th largest electrical company in the world. The company was burdened by, among other things, unsuccessful projects such as an automated baggage conveyor system at Frankfurt Airport and nuclear powerplant construction. In particular, the nuclear power plant at Würgassen, the commissioning of which was delayed by several years due to technical problems cost AEG hundreds of millions of DM. As a result, the company paid its last dividend in 1972.

The entertainment arm (&quot;Telefunken Fernseh und Rundfunk GmbH&quot;) headquartered in Hanover was sold. This was followed by the computer mainframe business (TR 4, TR 10, ) (a partnership under the name Telefunken Computer GmbH with the company Nixdorf) was sold to Siemens. The process computer (TR 84, TR 86, AEG 60–10, AEG 80–20, AEG 80–60) continued as &quot;Geschäftsbereich Automatisierungstechnik&quot; (after 1980 as ATM Computer GmbH).

In 1975 the former Telefunken Headquarter at Berlin-Charlottenburg, Ernst-Reuter-Platz 7 was sold. The building had been previously rented to Technische Universität Berlin.

In 1976, to circumvent the requirement of equal participation of employees in the supervisory board, Dr. Walter Cipa (Dipl.-Geol.) (AEG boss from 1976 to 1980) created four further companies as wholly owned joint stock companies in addition to the two household appliance companies. (The numbers in parentheses refer to percentage of turnover in 1980)
:AEG-Telefunken Anlagentechnik AG (37%)
:AEG-Telefunken Serienprodukte AG (16%)
:AEG-Telefunken Kommunikationstechnik AG (6%)
:Olympia-Werke AG (business office technology, 7%)
:AEG-Hausgeräte GmbH (22%)
:Telefunken Fernseh und Rundfunk GmbH (12%)

In 1979 &quot;Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft AEG-Telefunken&quot; was renamed &quot;AEG-Telefunken AG&quot; by dropping the supplement &quot;Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft&quot;, used since 1887. In February 1980, Heinz Dürr became board Chairman (until 1990).

In August 1982 a restructuring plan, backed with federal guarantees of 600 million DM and new bank loans of 275 million DM, fell apart at the first disagreement between the banks. A banking consortium provided an administrative loan of DM 1.1 billion to the AEG Group until June 1983; 400 million of which only to be available on a guarantee by the federal government. Not only was AEG-Telefunken AG affected, but also its subsidiaries &quot;Küppersbusch AG&quot; in Gelsenkirchen, &quot;Hermann Zanker Maschinenfabrik GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; in Tübingen and &quot;Carl Neff GmbH&quot; in Bretten. 
The &quot;Alno-Möbelwerke GmbH &amp; Co. KG&quot; in Pfullendorf was taken over by the minority shareholders, and separated from the group.

The suppliers to AEG were affected and some filed for bankruptcy—including &quot;Becher &amp; Co. Möbelfabriken KG&quot; in Bühlertann—with lack of continuity of company policy a factor. The site at Brunnenstraße in the former Berlin district of Wedding was also sold, as were the firms &quot;AEG-Fabrik Essen&quot; and &quot;Bauknecht&quot;.
*1983/84: the consumer electronics division (Telefunken television and broadcasting GmbH) was sold to the French group Thomson-Brandt.
*1985: AEG was taken over by Daimler-Benz AG. Daimler-Benz executive Edzard Reuter (from 1987 Daimler CEO), decides two companies should form an &quot;integrated technology group&quot; with beneficial synergy.
*1988: On its 60th anniversary the &quot;AEG-Forschungsinstituts&quot; (AEG Research Institute) creates the Carl-Ramsauer Prize for scientific/technical dissertations.
*1990: AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems GmbH is formed in association with Westinghouse Transportation Systems Inc.
*1992: Merger (or re-uniting) of the railway business with the &quot;Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke&quot; (LEW) in Hennigsdorf, resulting in the formation of &quot;AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH&quot; (AEG locomotives)
*1992: The Swedish company Atlas Copco acquires AEG Power Tools Ltd; divested in 2004 to Techtronic Industries.
*1994: sale of the Automation division to Schneider Electric and of &quot;AEG Hausgeräte AG&quot; to Electrolux.
*1995: &quot;AEG Schienenfahrzeuge GmbH&quot; becomes part of ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation (Adtranz) (subsequently becoming part of Bombardier Transportation in 2001; and more latterly becoming Alstom on January 29, 2021).
*1996: The Annual General Meeting of Daimler-Benz AG chaired by Juergen Schrempp decides upon the dissolution of the lossmaking group.
*1996: GEC ALSTHOM acquires AEG Power T&amp;D business
*September 1996: The company is deleted from the commercial register.

==Products==

===Locomotives and railway technology===

AEG played an important role in the history of the German railways; the company was involved in the development and manufacture of the electrical parts of almost all German electric locomotive series and contributed to the introduction of electrical power in German railways.

Additionally many steam locomotives were made in AEG factories. In 1931 the company acquired Borsig and transferred the locomotive production to the AEG-Borsig works (&quot;Borsig Lokomotiv-Werke GmbH&quot;) from the Borsig plant in Tegel. In 1948 the plant became VEB &quot;Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke&quot;. In addition to numerous electric locomotives produced for the DR steam locomotive production continued until 1954.

When the Federal Republic of Germany began implementing AC propulsion systems AEG found itself in competition with Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie. The prototype DB Class E320 was built with Krupp as dual voltage (15 kV and 25 kV AC) test machine, the technology ultimately leading to locomotives such as DB Class 120 and ICE 1.

Only after German reunification and the adoption of the LEW plant in Hennigsdorf did AEG&#x27;s name return to whole locomotive manufacturing, but only for a short time. &quot;AEG locomotives GmbH &quot; became part of ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation (later ADtranz) and currently the technology developed in the past, in part, now enables Alstom to build the very successful Traxx series of locomotives.

AEG also built the Hellenic Railways TRAINOSE Class 520 DMUs between 1989/1990/1991 and 1994/1995/1996.

===Aircraft===
AEG manufactured a range of aircraft from 1912 to 1918. The first aircraft in 1912 was of wooden construction and modeled after the Wright brothers biplane. It had a wingspan of ; was powered by an eight-cylinder engine producing 75 hp; unloaded weight was 850 kg; and could attain a speed of . From 1912, the construction of airplanes proceeded in mixed wood and steel tube construction with fabric covering.

One of the planes designed and built was a &quot;Riesenflugzeug&quot; (&quot;giant aircraft&quot;) AEG R.I. This aircraft was powered by four Mercedes D.IVa engines linked to a combination leather cone and dog clutch. The first flight tests were satisfactory, but on 3 September 1918, the R.I broke up in the air killing its seven crewmen.

The most successful in terms of production figures of all the AEG aircraft designs was that of the G.IV &quot;Grossflugzeuge&quot; (&quot;large aircraft&quot;) heavy tactical bomber, of which one still survives of the 320 built, as the sole surviving World War One German multi-engine bomber.

During the Second World War AEG produced machines for reconnaissance purposes, including a helicopter platform driven by an AC motor. This was a tethered craft that could not fly freely; the power supply was carried by three cables from the ground. The machine reached an altitude of 300 m.

===Cars===

AEG bought Kühlstein in 1902, founding the division &quot;Neue Automobil Gesellschaft&quot; (New Automobile Company), to make cars. AEG withdrew from car production in 1908.

Models produced include:
*AAG (1900 automobile)
*NAG Typ A
*NAG Typ B
*NAG Typ B2

===Film projectors===
AEG also produced for a long period a series of film projectors:
* Stillstandsmaschine 1919 Projektor 35 mm
* Theatermaschine 1920 Projektor 35 mm
* Triumphator I–III 1924–1935 Projektor 35 mm ACR 0710
* Successor (&quot;Lehrmeister&quot;) 1925–1935 Projektor 35 mm
* Kofferkino 1927 encased Projektor 35 mm
* Lehrmeister 1929 Projektor 35 mm ACR 0709 (Leitz)
* Mechau Modell 4 1929 – 1934 Projektor 35 mm
* Euro K 1938–42 Projektor 35 mm
* Euro M 1936 Projektor 35 mm
* Euro G 1938 Projektor 35 mm, Interlock-Version (G-MB)
* Euro M2 1939–1944 Projektor 35 mm

<text>Guillaume Joseph Hyacinthe Jean-Baptiste Le Gentil de la Galaisière (, 11 or 12 September 1725 – 22 October 1792) was a French astronomer who discovered several nebulae and was appointed to the Royal Academy of Sciences. He wrote on the estimation of the distance from the Earth to the Sun using solar transits, made unsuccessful attempts to observe the 1761 and 1769 transits of Venus from India during an 11-year journey from France, and wrote a popular account of his adventures and misadventures during the journey.

==Biography==
Guillaume Le Gentil was born on 11 or 12 September 1725 in Coutances and first intended to enter the church before turning to astronomy when inspired by a lecture by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle. By 1753 he was a professional astronomer and he wrote influentially on the subject of estimating the distance from the Earth to the Sun, the astronomical unit (AU), using transits of Mercury. He argued, contra Edmond Halley, that these transits could not be used for an accurate measurement of the AU. He discovered what are now known as the Messier objects M32, M36 and M38, as well as the nebulosity in M8, and he was the first to catalogue the dark nebula sometimes known as Le Gentil 3 (in the constellation Cygnus). 
He was part of the international collaborative project organized by Mikhail Lomonosov to measure the distance to the Sun, by observing the transit of Venus at different points on the earth.
Edmond Halley had suggested the idea, but it required careful measurements from different places on earth, and the project was launched with more than a hundred observers dispatched to different parts of the globe to observe the transit coming up in 1761.

As a part of the French expedition, Le Gentil set out for Pondicherry, a French possession in India. He set out from Paris in March 1760, and reached Isle de France (now Mauritius) in July. However, the Seven Years&#x27; War had broken out between France and Britain in the meantime, hindering further passage east. He finally managed to gain passage on a frigate that was bound for India&#x27;s Coromandel Coast, and he sailed in March 1761 with the intention of observing the transit from Pondicherry. Even though the transit was only a few months away, on 6 June, he was assured that they would make it in time. The ship was blown off-course by unfavorable winds and spent five weeks at sea. By the time it finally got close to Pondicherry, the captain learned that the British had occupied the city, so the frigate was obliged to return to Isle de France. When 6 June came the sky was clear, but the ship was still at sea, and he could not take astronomical observations with the vessel rolling about.

Having already completed the trip from Paris, he stayed for the next transit of Venus, which would come in another eight years (they occur in pairs 8 years apart, but each pair is separated from the next by 121 or 105 years). After spending some time mapping the eastern coast of Madagascar, he decided to record the 1769 transit from Manila in the Philippines. Encountering hostility from the Spanish authorities there, he headed back to Pondicherry, which had been restored to France by peace treaty in 1763, where he arrived in March 1768. He built a small observatory to view the transit. On the day of the event, 4 June 1769, the sky became overcast, and Le Gentil saw nothing.

The return trip was first delayed by dysentery, and further when his ship was caught in a storm and dropped him off at Île Bourbon (Réunion), where he had to wait until a Spanish ship took him home. He finally arrived in Paris in October 1771, having been away for eleven years, only to find that he had been declared legally dead and been replaced in the Royal Academy of Sciences. His wife had remarried, and all his relatives had &quot;enthusiastically plundered his estate&quot;. Due to shipwrecks and wartime attacks on ships, none of the letters he had sent to the academy or to his relatives had reached their destinations. Lengthy litigation and the intervention of the king were ultimately required before he recovered his seat in the academy and remarried.

During the time he spent in India, Le Gentil examined local astronomical traditions and wrote several notes on the topic. He reported that the duration of the lunar eclipse of 30 August 1765 was predicted by a Tamil astronomer, based on the computation of the size and extent of the earth-shadow, and was found short by 41 seconds, whereas the charts of Tobias Mayer were wrong by 68 seconds.

He died in Paris on 22 October 1792.

== Catalogue ==
Le Gentil memoir from 1749 contains:

# Messier 32
# Lagoon Nebula
# Le Gentil 3
# Messier 41 
# Messier 36
# Messier 38
Aside from M41 previously found by John Flamsteed, the others are considered to have been first found or discovered independently by Le Gentil.

==Play and opera==
Le Gentil is the subject of a play by Canadian playwright Maureen Hunter. &quot;Transit of Venus&quot; was first produced at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in 1992. It was subsequently made into an opera of the same name with music by Victor Davies, presented by Manitoba Opera in 2007, and Opera Carolina in 2010.

==Literature==
Le Gentil is the subject of a novel by Antoine Laurain &quot;Les Caprices d&#x27;un astre,&quot; published in 2022, and translated into English in 2023 as &quot; An Astronomer in Love &quot;.

==Tributes==
Boulevard Legentil-de-la-Galaisière, one of the main streets in his home town Coutances, was named after him in 1866. Le Gentil crater on the Moon was named in his honour in 1935, and asteroid 12718 Le Gentil in 2004.

<text>Cynthia Breazeal is an American robotics scientist and entrepreneur. She is a former chief scientist and chief experience officer of Jibo, a company she co-founded in 2012 that developed personal assistant robots. Currently, she is a professor of media arts and sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the director of the Personal Robots group at the MIT Media Lab. Her most recent work has focused on the theme of living everyday life in the presence of AI, and gradually gaining insight into the long-term impacts of social robots. 

== Early life and education ==

As the daughter of two scientists, she had early access to the fields of computer science and engineering. Under the guidance of her parents, Breazeal earned a B.Sc in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1989; her M.S. in 1993; and her Sc.D. in 2000 in electrical engineering and computer science, both from MIT. After watching a NASA robot, she decided to switch her focus to social robotics.

She developed the robot Kismet as a doctoral thesis under Rodney Brooks, which looked into the expressive social exchange between humans and humanoid robots. Kismet, as well as other robots Breazeal co-developed while a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, can now be seen at the MIT Museum. Notable examples include the upper torso humanoid robot, Cog; and the insect-like robot, Hannibal. In the early 2000s, she worked on Leonard, Aida, Autom and Huggable.

== MIT career ==
Breazeal is a professor of Media Arts and Sciences at MIT, where she founded and is the current director of the Personal Robotics group within the Media Lab. She has written several books in the field of robotics and has published several peer-reviewed articles on the topic. She also serves on multiple editorial boards for autonomous and various other robotic committees. Growing up and while studying in university, Breazeal found that the issue was that robots too often only interacted with objects and not people. In addition to this, Breazeal found that if we give robots the ability to perform non-verbal cues, such as those that humans inherently do every day, then humans will treat and see robots more like companions and like humans. She also explores the idea of using robots to build better connections between humans, such as humans who live a long distance away from each other.

Breazeal is also the associate director for the Bridge: MIT Quest for Intelligence, where she works on implementing AI through grade school.

Breazeal has centered her work around the concept of &quot;living with AI&quot; which studies the impact of incorporating social robots into our everyday lives. The purpose of adding sentiment to AI is offering support to people, and creating companionship and support in places where there may be none.

In January 2022, Breazeal was named as dean for digital learning at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As dean, Breazeal will lead in aiding to grow MIT&#x27;s online portfolio, libraries, bootcamps, and identifying the areas for innovation, while researching opening learning and how different methods and technologies can improve digital learning.

== Research ==

Leonardo was one of her earliest robots, co-developed with Stan Winston Studio, and a successor to Kismet (recognized in 2006 by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;50 Best Robots Ever&quot;). Leonardo was also used to investigate social cognition and theory of mind abilities on robots with application to human-robot collaboration, in addition to developing social learning abilities for robots such as imitation, tutelage, and social referencing. Next, is another of Breazeal&#x27;s robots in this tradition, and was named by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 50 Best Inventions of 2008. Next is an MDS robot (mobile, dexterous, social) that combines rich social communication abilities with mobile dexterity to investigate more complex forms of human-robot teaming.

Breazeal&#x27;s Personal Robots group has also done a number of design projects and publications regarding social robots, covering topics such as education, psychology, personalization, and telepresence.
Social robots developed in Breazeal&#x27;s Personal Robots group include Autom, a robot diet and exercise coach (the PhD thesis of Cory Kidd). It was found to be more effective than a computer counterpart in sustaining engagement and building trust and a working alliance with users. Autom was the predecessor of Mabu (Catalia Health). Breazeal&#x27;s group has also explored expressive remote presence robots such as MeBot. The physical social embodiment of the MeBot was found to elicit greater psychological involvement, engagement, and desire to cooperate over purely screen-based video conferencing or a mobile screen. There is also the Huggable which was designed as a pediatric companion to help support the emotional needs of hospitalized children and to help support and augment child life specialists.

Breazeal has also been part of creating a robotic flower garden installation, Cyberflora which was exhibited at the 2003 National Design Triennial at the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum.

She served as a consultant on the 2001 Spielberg-Kubric movie &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot;.
She also has a prominent role as a virtual participant in a popular exhibit on robots with the traveling exhibit, Star Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination, interacting with a real C-3PO (voiced by Anthony Daniels) as she spoke to the audience through a pre-recorded message displayed on a large plasma flat-screen display.

In 2003, she was named by the MIT &quot;Technology Review&quot; TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of thirty-five.

In 2020, she was elected a AAAI Fellow by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.
In March 2020, during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, Breazeal and her team launched a site with over 60 activities, so students can get access to STEM activities from the lockdown to help teachers and parents continue education from home.

== Jibo==
On July 16, 2014, Breazeal launched an Indiegogo campaign to crowdfund the development of Jibo, a personal assistant robot widely marketed as the world&#x27;s first family robot. She served as chief scientist and chief experience officer. Jibo reached its initial fund-raising goal and was due to launch in 2015, then later pushed to 2016, before finally being released in November 2017. The robot was created to enable more engaging social experiences, including storytelling and other forms of entertainment.

Jibo generally received poor reviews, being compared to the more powerful and much cheaper Amazon Alexa and Google Home. The software development kit expected for developers was never released. On December 15, 2017 the company announced layoffs and shut its doors soon after. By the time Jibo shut down, it had raised more than $70 million. Breazeal has made no public comments in regard to the closing of Jibo. In March 2020, the assets of Jibo Inc. were acquired by NTT Corporation. &quot;NTT Disruption&quot; intends to bring Jibo to the healthcare and education markets.

== Awards and recognition ==
In 2008, she received the Gilbreth Lectures Award by the National Academy of Engineering. Her Nexi robot was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Best Inventions of 2008.

In 2014, Breazeal was recognized as an entrepreneur as &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s Most Promising Women Entrepreneurs, and she was also a recipient of the L&#x27;Oreal USA Women in Digital NEXT Generation Award. The same year, she received the 2014 George R. Stibitz Computer &amp; Communications Pioneer Award for seminal contributions to the development of Social Robotics and Human Robot Interaction.

In 2015, Breazeal was named by &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine as one of the Women to Watch.

Jibo was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 25 Best Inventions of 2017.

<doc id="632482" wikidata="Q5221424" url="?curid=632482" title="Litopenaeus setiferus">
<text>Litopenaeus setiferus (also accepted: &quot;Penaeus setiferus&quot;, and known by various common names including Atlantic white shrimp, &quot;white shrimp&quot;, &quot;gray shrimp&quot;, &quot;lake shrimp&quot;, &quot;green shrimp&quot;, &quot;green-tailed shrimp&quot;, &quot;blue-tailed shrimp&quot;, &quot;rainbow shrimp&quot;, &quot;Daytona shrimp&quot;, &quot;Mayport Shrimp&quot;, &quot;common shrimp&quot;, &quot;southern shrimp&quot;, and, in Mexico, &quot;&quot;) is a species of prawn found along the Atlantic coast of North America and in the Gulf of Mexico. It was the subject of the earliest shrimp fishery in the United States.

==Distribution==
The range of &quot;L. setiferus&quot; extends from Fire Island, New York to Ciudad Campeche, Mexico. It requires warm water, and is unable to survive below , with appreciable growth only occurring at temperatures over .

==Description==
&quot;Litopenaeus setiferus&quot; may reach a total length (excluding antennae) of , with females being larger than males. The antennae may be up to three times the length of the body, which is bluish white with a tinge of pink on the sides, and black spots. The pleopods are often redder, and the uropods and telson are green. The rostrum is long and thin, with 5–11 teeth on the upper edge and two on the lower edge, and continues along the carapace as a dorsal carina (ridge). Deep grooves alongside the carina separate the related species &quot;Farfantepenaeus aztecus&quot; (&quot;brown shrimp&quot;) and &quot;Farfantepenaeus duorarum&quot; (&quot;pink shrimp&quot;) from &quot;L. setiferus&quot;, which is sometimes called the non-grooved shrimp.

==Ecology==
&quot;Litopenaeus setiferus&quot; lives in estuaries and from the littoral zone to water with a depth of in the Atlantic, or up to in the Gulf of Mexico. &quot;Litopenaeus setiferus&quot; is an omnivore; in Lake Pontchartrain, it feeds chiefly on the seagrass &quot;Vallisneria americana&quot; and detritus. Many aquatic animals feed on &quot;L. setiferus&quot;, including fish such as red drum (&quot;Sciaenops ocellatus&quot;) and turtles such as the loggerhead sea turtle (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;).

==Life cycle==
Spawning in &quot;L. setiferus&quot; occurs while the water is warm, between the increase in water temperatures in the spring and the sudden decline in temperature in the fall. It generally occurs within of the shoreline, in water less than deep in the Atlantic, or deep in the Gulf of Mexico. Males attach a spermatophore to the females, which is then used to fertilize the eggs as they are released. Each female releases 500,000–1,000,000 purplish eggs, each across, which sink to the bottom of the water column.

After 10–12 hours, the eggs hatch into nauplius larvae, which are long, planktonic and unable to feed. They molt five times to reach the protozoa stage, long. These grow to long over two molts, before passing through three molts as a mysis larva. About 15–20 days after hatching, the animals reaches the postlarva stage; in the second postlarval stage, at a length of , they begin to enter estuaries and drop down to the substrate.

Spring rains flush the shrimp out into the ocean. In the Eastern United States, shrimp then migrate south towards warmer waters.

==Fishery==
Subsistence fishing for prawns was carried out by Native Americans along the Atlantic coast. This knowledge was passed on to European settlers, and &quot;Litopenaeus setiferus&quot; became the subject of the earliest shrimp fishery in the United States, with commercial fishery for &quot;L. setiferus&quot; starting as early as 1709.

The harvesting for &quot;L. setiferus&quot; began in the 1950s and since that time is collected monthly throughout Gulf of Mexico.

<text>In quantum computing, a quantum algorithm is an algorithm that runs on a realistic model of quantum computation, the most commonly used model being the quantum circuit model of computation. A classical (or non-quantum) algorithm is a finite sequence of instructions, or a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem, where each step or instruction can be performed on a classical computer. Similarly, a quantum algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, where each of the steps can be performed on a quantum computer. Although all classical algorithms can also be performed on a quantum computer, the term quantum algorithm is generally reserved for algorithms that seem inherently quantum, or use some essential feature of quantum computation such as quantum superposition or quantum entanglement.

Problems that are undecidable using classical computers remain undecidable using quantum computers. What makes quantum algorithms interesting is that they might be able to solve some problems faster than classical algorithms because the quantum superposition and quantum entanglement that quantum algorithms exploit generally cannot be efficiently simulated on classical computers (see Quantum supremacy).

The best-known algorithms are Shor&#x27;s algorithm for factoring and Grover&#x27;s algorithm for searching an unstructured database or an unordered list. Shor&#x27;s algorithm runs much (almost exponentially) faster than the best-known classical algorithm for factoring, the general number field sieve. Grover&#x27;s algorithm runs quadratically faster than the best possible classical algorithm for the same task, a linear search.

==Overview==
Quantum algorithms are usually described, in the commonly used circuit model of quantum computation, by a quantum circuit that acts on some input qubits and terminates with a measurement. A quantum circuit consists of simple quantum gates, each of which acts on some finite number of qubits. Quantum algorithms may also be stated in other models of quantum computation, such as the Hamiltonian oracle model.

Quantum algorithms can be categorized by the main techniques involved in the algorithm. Some commonly used techniques/ideas in quantum algorithms include phase kick-back, phase estimation, the quantum Fourier transform, quantum walks, amplitude amplification and topological quantum field theory. Quantum algorithms may also be grouped by the type of problem solved; see, e.g., the survey on quantum algorithms for algebraic problems.

==Algorithms based on the quantum Fourier transform==
The quantum Fourier transform is the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform, and is used in several quantum algorithms. The Hadamard transform is also an example of a quantum Fourier transform over an n-dimensional vector space over the field F2. The quantum Fourier transform can be efficiently implemented on a quantum computer using only a polynomial number of quantum gates.

===Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm===

The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm solves a black-box problem that requires exponentially many queries to the black box for any deterministic classical computer, but can be done with a single query by a quantum computer. However, when comparing bounded-error classical and quantum algorithms, there is no speedup, since a classical probabilistic algorithm can solve the problem with a constant number of queries with small probability of error. The algorithm determines whether a function &quot;f&quot; is either constant (0 on all inputs or 1 on all inputs) or balanced (returns 1 for half of the input domain and 0 for the other half).

===Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm===
The Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm is the first quantum algorithm that solves a problem more efficiently than the best known classical algorithm. It was designed to create an oracle separation between BQP and BPP.

===Simon&#x27;s algorithm===
Simon&#x27;s algorithm solves a black-box problem exponentially faster than any classical algorithm, including bounded-error probabilistic algorithms. This algorithm, which achieves an exponential speedup over all classical algorithms that we consider efficient, was the motivation for Shor&#x27;s algorithm for factoring.

===Quantum phase estimation algorithm===
The quantum phase estimation algorithm is used to determine the eigenphase of an eigenvector of a unitary gate, given a quantum state proportional to the eigenvector and access to the gate. The algorithm is frequently used as a subroutine in other algorithms.

===Shor&#x27;s algorithm===
Shor&#x27;s algorithm solves the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem in polynomial time, whereas the best known classical algorithms take super-polynomial time. It is unknown whether these problems are in P or NP-complete. It is also one of the few quantum algorithms that solves a non-black-box problem in polynomial time, where the best known classical algorithms run in super-polynomial time.

===Hidden subgroup problem===
The abelian hidden subgroup problem is a generalization of many problems that can be solved by a quantum computer, such as Simon&#x27;s problem, solving Pell&#x27;s equation, testing the principal ideal of a ring R and factoring. There are efficient quantum algorithms known for the Abelian hidden subgroup problem. The more general hidden subgroup problem, where the group is not necessarily abelian, is a generalization of the previously mentioned problems, as well as graph isomorphism and certain lattice problems. Efficient quantum algorithms are known for certain non-abelian groups. However, no efficient algorithms are known for the symmetric group, which would give an efficient algorithm for graph isomorphism and the dihedral group, which would solve certain lattice problems.

===Estimating Gauss sums===
A Gauss sum is a type of exponential sum. The best known classical algorithm for estimating these sums takes exponential time. Since the discrete logarithm problem reduces to Gauss sum estimation, an efficient classical algorithm for estimating Gauss sums would imply an efficient classical algorithm for computing discrete logarithms, which is considered unlikely. However, quantum computers can estimate Gauss sums to polynomial precision in polynomial time.

===Fourier fishing and Fourier checking===
Consider an oracle consisting of &quot;n&quot; random Boolean functions mapping &quot;n&quot;-bit strings to a Boolean value, with the goal of finding n &quot;n&quot;-bit strings &quot;z&quot;1..., &quot;zn&quot; such that for the Hadamard-Fourier transform, at least 3/4 of the strings satisfy

:formula_1

and at least 1/4 satisfy

:formula_2

This can be done in bounded-error quantum polynomial time (BQP).

==Algorithms based on amplitude amplification==
Amplitude amplification is a technique that allows the amplification of a chosen subspace of a quantum state. Applications of amplitude amplification usually lead to quadratic speedups over the corresponding classical algorithms. It can be considered as a generalization of Grover&#x27;s algorithm.

===Grover&#x27;s algorithm===
Grover&#x27;s algorithm searches an unstructured database (or an unordered list) with N entries for a marked entry, using only formula_3 queries instead of the formula_4 queries required classically. Classically, formula_4 queries are required even allowing bounded-error probabilistic algorithms.

Theorists have considered a hypothetical generalization of a standard quantum computer that could access the histories of the hidden variables in Bohmian mechanics. (Such a computer is completely hypothetical and would &quot;not&quot; be a standard quantum computer, or even possible under the standard theory of quantum mechanics.) Such a hypothetical computer could implement a search of an N-item database in at most formula_6 steps. This is slightly faster than the formula_3 steps taken by Grover&#x27;s algorithm. However, neither search method would allow either model of quantum computer to solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time.

===Quantum counting===
Quantum counting solves a generalization of the search problem. It solves the problem of counting the number of marked entries in an unordered list, instead of just detecting whether one exists. Specifically, it counts the number of marked entries in an formula_8-element list with an error of at most formula_9 by making only formula_10 queries, where formula_11 is the number of marked elements in the list. More precisely, the algorithm outputs an estimate formula_12 for formula_11, the number of marked entries, with accuracy formula_14.

==Algorithms based on quantum walks==
A quantum walk is the quantum analogue of a classical random walk. A classical random walk can be described by a probability distribution over some states, while a quantum walk can be described by a quantum superposition over states. Quantum walks are known to give exponential speedups for some black-box problems. They also provide polynomial speedups for many problems. A framework for the creation of quantum walk algorithms exists and is a versatile tool.

===Boson sampling problem===
The Boson Sampling Problem in an experimental configuration assumes an input of bosons (e.g., photons) of moderate number that are randomly scattered into a large number of output modes, constrained by a defined unitarity. When individual photons are used, the problem is isomorphic to a multi-photon quantum walk. The problem is then to produce a fair sample of the probability distribution of the output that depends on the input arrangement of bosons and the unitarity. Solving this problem with a classical computer algorithm requires computing the permanent of the unitary transform matrix, which may take a prohibitively long time or be outright impossible. In 2014, it was proposed that existing technology and standard probabilistic methods of generating single-photon states could be used as an input into a suitable quantum computable linear optical network and that sampling of the output probability distribution would be demonstrably superior using quantum algorithms. In 2015, investigation predicted the sampling problem had similar complexity for inputs other than Fock-state photons and identified a transition in computational complexity from classically simulable to just as hard as the Boson Sampling Problem, depending on the size of coherent amplitude inputs.

===Element distinctness problem===
The element distinctness problem is the problem of determining whether all the elements of a list are distinct. Classically, formula_15 queries are required for a list of size formula_8; however, it can be solved in formula_17 queries on a quantum computer. The optimal algorithm was put forth by Andris Ambainis, and Yaoyun Shi first proved a tight lower bound when the size of the range is sufficiently large. Ambainis and Kutin independently (and via different proofs) extended that work to obtain the lower bound for all functions.

===Triangle-finding problem===
The triangle-finding problem is the problem of determining whether a given graph contains a triangle (a clique of size 3). The best-known lower bound for quantum algorithms is formula_15, but the best algorithm known requires O(&quot;N&quot;1.297) queries, an improvement over the previous best O(&quot;N&quot;1.3) queries.

===Formula evaluation===
A formula is a tree with a gate at each internal node and an input bit at each leaf node. The problem is to evaluate the formula, which is the output of the root node, given oracle access to the input.

A well studied formula is the balanced binary tree with only NAND gates. This type of formula requires formula_19 queries using randomness, where formula_20. With a quantum algorithm, however, it can be solved in formula_21 queries. No better quantum algorithm for this case was known until one was found for the unconventional Hamiltonian oracle model. The same result for the standard setting soon followed.

Fast quantum algorithms for more complicated formulas are also known.

===Group commutativity===
The problem is to determine if a black-box group, given by &quot;k&quot; generators, is commutative. A black-box group is a group with an oracle function, which must be used to perform the group operations (multiplication, inversion, and comparison with identity). The interest in this context lies in the query complexity, which is the number of oracle calls needed to solve the problem. The deterministic and randomized query complexities are formula_22 and formula_23, respectively. A quantum algorithm requires formula_24 queries, while the best-known classical algorithm uses formula_25 queries.

==BQP-complete problems==
The complexity class BQP (bounded-error quantum polynomial time) is the set of decision problems solvable by a quantum computer in polynomial time with error probability of at most 1/3 for all instances. It is the quantum analogue to the classical complexity class BPP.

A problem is BQP-complete if it is in BQP and any problem in BQP can be reduced to it in polynomial time. Informally, the class of BQP-complete problems are those that are as hard as the hardest problems in BQP and are themselves efficiently solvable by a quantum computer (with bounded error).

===Computing knot invariants===
Witten had shown that the Chern-Simons topological quantum field theory (TQFT) can be solved in terms of Jones polynomials. A quantum computer can simulate a TQFT, and thereby approximate the Jones polynomial, which as far as we know, is hard to compute classically in the worst-case scenario.

===Quantum simulation===

The idea that quantum computers might be more powerful than classical computers originated in Richard Feynman&#x27;s observation that classical computers seem to require exponential time to simulate many-particle quantum systems, yet quantum many-body systems are able to &quot;solve themselves.&quot; Since then, the idea that quantum computers can simulate quantum physical processes exponentially faster than classical computers has been greatly fleshed out and elaborated. Efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) quantum algorithms have been developed for simulating both Bosonic and Fermionic systems, as well as the simulation of chemical reactions beyond the capabilities of current classical supercomputers using only a few hundred qubits. Quantum computers can also efficiently simulate topological quantum field theories. In addition to its intrinsic interest, this result has led to efficient quantum algorithms for estimating quantum topological invariants such as Jones and HOMFLY polynomials, and the Turaev-Viro invariant of three-dimensional manifolds.

===Solving a linear system of equations===
In 2009, Aram Harrow, Avinatan Hassidim, and Seth Lloyd, formulated a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems. The algorithm estimates the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector to a given linear system of equations.

Provided that the linear system is sparse and has a low condition number formula_26, and that the user is interested in the result of a scalar measurement on the solution vector (instead of the values of the solution vector itself), then the algorithm has a runtime of formula_27, where formula_8 is the number of variables in the linear system. This offers an exponential speedup over the fastest classical algorithm, which runs in formula_29 (or formula_30 for positive semidefinite matrices).

==Hybrid quantum/classical algorithms==
Hybrid Quantum/Classical Algorithms combine quantum state preparation and measurement with classical optimization. These algorithms generally aim to determine the ground-state eigenvector and eigenvalue of a Hermitian operator.

=== QAOA ===
The quantum approximate optimization algorithm takes inspiration from quantum annealing, performing a discretized approximation of quantum annealing using a quantum circuit. It can be used to solve problems in graph theory. The algorithm makes use of classical optimization of quantum operations to maximize an &quot;objective function.&quot;

=== Variational quantum eigensolver ===
The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm applies classical optimization to minimize the energy expectation value of an ansatz state to find the ground state of a Hermitian operator, such as a molecule&#x27;s Hamiltonian. It can also be extended to find excited energies of molecular Hamiltonians.

=== Contracted quantum eigensolver ===
The contracted quantum eigensolver (CQE) algorithm minimizes the residual of a contraction (or projection) of the Schrödinger equation onto the space of two (or more) electrons to find the ground- or excited-state energy and two-electron reduced density matrix of a molecule. It is based on classical methods for solving energies and two-electron reduced density matrices directly from the anti-Hermitian contracted Schrödinger equation.

<text>The Type 82 or &quot;Bristol&quot;-class destroyer was a 1960s guided missile destroyer design intended to replace s in the Royal Navy. Originally eight warships were planned to provide area air-defence for the four planned CVA-01 aircraft carriers. They would also have been able to operate independently as modern cruisers &quot;East of Suez&quot;.

Anti-aircraft capability was provided by the new Sea Dart missile system and the class also had anti-submarine capability. They were expected to serve as a group of four Type 82s forming the outer escort of the carrier with four &quot;Broad Beam&quot; &quot;Leander&quot;-class frigates as the inner escort.

The CVA-01s were all cancelled by 1966, eliminating one of the main roles for the class and removing the need for such a large warship. In its place a smaller design carrying Sea Dart for air defence entered service as the Type 42 destroyer. One Type 82, , was ordered to act as a testbed for the various technologies to be used on future ships. Sometimes described as a &quot;light cruiser&quot;, she was officially classified as a destroyer.

==History==
The CVA-01 aircraft carrier project was cancelled in the 1966 Defence White Paper, eliminating the requirement for the Type 82 class. Nevertheless, one hull of the original four was ordered on 4 October 1966 for use as a testbed for new technologies. HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; was laid down in 1967, featuring four new systems:
* The Sea Dart missile that would later be fitted in the Type 42 destroyers and s.
* The Ikara anti-submarine weapon, later fitted to some s.
* A new 113 mm 4.5-inch Mk 8 gun.
* The advanced Action Data Automation Weapons System Mk.2 (ADAWS-2), a computer system designed to coordinate the ship&#x27;s weapons and sensors.
The latter feature, although not externally apparent, was perhaps the most pioneering of the design; a leap forward from the rudimentary action information system of the &quot;Counties&quot; and its heavy reliance on manual data input.

The Type 82 was followed into service by the smaller Type 42 destroyer that featured the same Sea Dart missile, 113 mm Mark 8 gun and integrated ADAWS. It was not a direct replacement for the Type 82 &quot;per se&quot;, but filled the area air defence role in a Cold War, North Atlantic navy. The Type 42 design was however smaller and had a lower manpower requirement and as such many more hulls could be brought into service than a design of the Type 82&#x27;s size. It also featured a flight deck and hangar for its own air component providing improved anti-submarine, surface-strike and general utility to the design.

==Design==
The Type 82 was loosely based on the layout of the and the Type 12I (hence the inclusion in the escort Type numbering system.) However the County and &quot;Leander&quot; designs provided only a limited weapon and command replacement for the war-built cruisers, the last of which had been decommissioned in 1962-65.

The County class depended on data links from the aircraft carriers (&quot;Eagle&quot;, &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Victorious)&quot; equipped with 984 3D radar and ADWAS computers which were able to track 50-100 targets and prioritize targets for fighters, missiles and long range AA. The later &quot;Tiger&quot;-class cruisers were completed too late with unreliable machinery and automatic guns prone to jamming. The Tigers were inefficient East of Suez and similar problems plagued the last Battle-class and &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers. The Counties had the same obsolescent 4.5-inch guns and Seaslug missile system was now obsolete. Their helicopter facilities were cumbersome and unrealistic for deterrence of Soviet nuclear submarines or even diesel submarines of the Chinese navy and other Far-East nations. The serious naval confrontation between Malaya and Indonesia from 1963-6, showed Asian powers now had jet bombers armed with cruise missiles, and RN carriers with subsonic second generation de Havilland Sea Vixen and Supermarine Scimitar fighters were insufficient. Three of the RN strike carriers in 1963-65 had capacity for only 25 aircraft, which was completely inadequate for the required mix of strike aircraft, fighters, interceptors, tankers, Fairey Gannets and anti-submarine helicopters or aircraft.

Moving the anti-submarine requirement to separate small cruisers or carriers armed with either 4-6 anti submarine helicopters or more reliable dual conventional/nuclear missile anti-submarine missiles such as Ikara or ASROC propelled the development of the Type 82 and the legend was set on 7 July 1965.

Other East of Suez issues in the Gulf and with Egypt, UAE and China and unstated India. Iraq and Iran were also seen as justifying more powerful cruiser substitutes as aircraft carrier complements. As with the County class, gun armament was light, no light AA was included prior to the 1982 Falklands War and the warships were unarmoured. Scantlings, supply and storage capacity was based on destroyer standards as in the preceding Counties. The Type 82 was a much more spacious warship better planned for sustained crew functionality in operational conditions in distant waters.

The vessel was powered by a combined steam and gas (COSAG) plant, and was the last warship designed for the Royal Navy to be powered by steam. The steam plant vented through the large fore funnel while the gas plant exhausted though a side-by-side pair of after funnels (on either side of the extensive air intakes and filters for the gas turbines), giving it a unique three-funnelled layout.

===Weapon systems===

The new Sea Dart missile was fired from a twin-arm launcher on the quarterdeck and there was a pair of radar Type 909 target illumination sets, an improvement over the single radar Type 901 set of the County-class design.

The single Mark 8 4.5-inch gun was not intended as an anti-aircraft weapon, and as such had an elevation of only 55°. The weapon was designed specifically for reliability over rate of fire, allowing only a single mounting to be shipped, and the comparatively low rate of fire of 25 rounds per minute was more than suitable for the intended anti-ship and shore bombardment roles.

The third weapon system was the Australian Ikara anti-submarine weapon; a rocket-powered aircraft capable of carrying a Mk.44 homing torpedo or nuclear depth bomb out to 10 miles from the ship. The Ikara was backed up by a Mark 10 Limbo anti-submarine mortar. Although capable of landing a Westland Wasp helicopter on the quarterdeck the ship lacked a hangar and aviation facilities and thus had to rely on external air support.

===Electronics===
The original design called for a long-range 3-D air search radar to be fitted; the joint Anglo-Dutch Type 988 &quot;Broomstick&quot;, and early drawings and artist&#x27;s impression show a large dome on the bridge to carry this set. A similar set was to be fitted to the CVA-01 design. However, the RN dropped out of the program due to high cost, and instead she was fitted with the ageing Type 965 air search radar, with a &quot;twin bedstead&quot; AKE-2 antennae, on a stump foremast. Radar Type 992Q low-angle search was carried on the tall, slender mainmast and as such the electronics fit had not advanced significantly from the County class. Type 909 sets were shipped fore and aft for Sea Dart fire control, allowing two targets to be engaged at any one time.

The main advance in the design was with how the sensor data was processed and displayed. The ADAWS-2 system, based on two Ferranti FM1600 computers, integrated the identification, tracking and engagement of targets into a single system. ADAWS-2 could accept input from any of the ship&#x27;s radars or sonars, identify targets and produce continuous track histories. Using this information it could evaluate threat levels and control the engagement of targets using the relevant weapons systems. The whole process occurred almost automatically, requiring only oversight and command from the human operator. This new generation of warship would be commanded from an operations room within the ship rather than the traditional location of the bridge.

** 1 × radar Type 965 2D air warning, later;
** 1 × radar Type 1022 2D air search

==Appraisal==

Despite introducing various new systems, the role for which &quot;Bristol&quot; was designed never materialised. She faced the problem of entering a navy that had no operational role or requirement for her and that was faced with rapidly changing priorities. This single, large ship was manpower- and maintenance-intensive and was not fitted out to the standard required for front line deployment.

The major shortcomings in the design were twofold: the lack of an air component and the lack of a long-range anti-ship weapon. Because this class of destroyer was proposed to be deployed alongside the new aircraft carriers, both of these capabilities were intended to be delivered from other components of the carrier battle group. Within a few years these features would be standard on ships of this size and type. These deficiencies limited her to squadron (rather than individual patrol) duties, and &quot;Bristol&quot; is usually seen as something of a white elephant.

==Service==
The role which the Type 82 was built for never materialised; &quot;Bristol,&quot; the only ship built, spent most of her service in the 1970s trialling and building up experience using the new weapons and computer systems. A major boiler fire in 1974 destroyed the steam plant. Older ships might have been crippled by this, but &quot;Bristol&quot; was able to operate for three years using only her turbine plant, demonstrating the flexibility and utility of the latter. The steam plant was repaired in 1976 and it was not until 1979 that she was fitted out for frontline service with ECM, Corvus countermeasures launchers and a pair of World War II-era Oerlikon 20 mm cannons. During this refit the Limbo weapon was removed; the well subsequently saw service as a makeshift swimming pool.

Thanks to her size, &quot;Bristol&quot; was suitable for use as a flagship as she could embark the extra staff members necessary for this role. As such, she served as the Royal Navy flagship during Exercise &quot;Ocean Safari 81&quot;. After a short refit, during which the mortar well was plated over to allow the landing of large helicopters on the quarterdeck, she joined the Royal Navy task force in the South Atlantic in the 1982 Falklands War as a component of the carrier battle-group. After the conflict she remained ‘’in situ’’ as flagship of the remaining Royal Navy forces. On return to the UK she entered a refit and, in light of the lessons of the conflict, she had her light anti aircraft weapons augmented with a pair of twin Oerlikon / BMARC 30 mm GCM-A03 and a pair of single Oerlikon / BMARC 20 mm GAM-B01 guns. Loral-Hycor SRBOC countermeasures launchers were also added to augment the elderly Corvus launchers.

With the Royal Navy short on hulls after damages and losses incurred in the Falklands, &quot;Bristol&quot; remained in commission and made several overseas deployments until paid off for refit in 1984. Another boiler explosion when entering refit caused extensive damage and had to be repaired. The major work undertaken in the refit was to replace the obsolete radar Type 965 with the new radar Type 1022 for long range air search duties. In addition, the Ikara system was removed and it was intended that it be replaced with two triple STWS-1 launchers for 324 mm anti-submarine torpedoes, although these were never fitted.

In 1987 she became part of Dartmouth training squadron, for which duties she had extra accommodation and classrooms added in the former Ikara and Limbo spaces. Finally she was withdrawn from service on 14 June 1991 and configured for her next role in 1993 to be a replacement for as a static training ship at , a shore facility in Portsmouth.

As of 28 October 2020, &quot;Bristol&quot; was decommissioned and is currently awaiting disposal.

<doc id="632492" wikidata="Q2922699" url="?curid=632492" title="Bow Street">
<text>Bow Street is a thoroughfare in Covent Garden, Westminster, London. It connects Long Acre, Russell Street and Wellington Street, and is part of a route from St Giles to Waterloo Bridge.

The street was developed in 1633 by Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford for residential purposes. A number of notable people lived here in the 17th and 18th centuries, including Oliver Cromwell and Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford. In the 18th century, the street declined as a place of residence following the establishment of the nearby Covent Garden Theatre, which led to a reputation for prostitution. During the 19th century, Bow Street was a &quot;de facto&quot; extension of Covent Garden and its associated markets, selling then-exotic fruit and vegetables. 

Bow Street has a strong connection with the law; the Bow Street Runners, an early voluntary police force, was established here by Henry Fielding in 1750, and the Metropolitan Police Service operated a station house from 1832, which led to the construction of the Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court.

Today, only a short run of buildings from No. 35 to Russell Street remain on their original sites; the rest having been given up for large buildings.

==Geography==
Bow Street is around long and runs between Russell Street and Long Acre, to the east of Covent Garden. South of Russell Street, the road continues as Wellington Street towards The Strand. As with several other streets in the local area, signs featuring its name are marked with the &quot;Theatreland&quot; logo. The street has historically been part of a through route from St Giles to Waterloo Bridge, though it is no longer the recommended signposted route.

The nearest tube station is Covent Garden. No bus services run along Bow Street, though the route of London Buses route RV1 (from Covent Garden to Waterloo Bridge) ran close by.

Bow Street was part of a B road, numbered B401, along with Wellington Street; but it has now been declassified and only Endell Street now bears the number.

==History==
===Early history===

The area around Bow Street was first developed by Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford in 1633. Buildings were first erected on the west side of the street that year, and it was fully built by around 1635–36. Development to the northeast was restricted by a brick wall that had been built by the Earl&#x27;s cousin, Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, in 1610 as a land boundary and remained undeveloped for some time. It was eventually built on between 1673 and 1677, with eleven properties constructed.

The street was named Bow Street in 1638 after its basic shape. It was always the Earl&#x27;s intention to extend it as far as Long Acre, but this was delayed. It was eventually connected by his son, William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford, who gave ownership of the street over to the Paving Commissioners of St. Martin in the Fields, so it could be a public right of way.

Bow Street had a number of notable residents in the 17th and 18th centuries. Oliver Cromwell moved to the street in 1645. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford was born there in 1661. Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset lived here around 1685. The woodcarver Grinling Gibbons had premises on Bow Street between 1678 and 1721, while the physician John Radcliffe stayed on the street in the 1680s. Author and scribe John Ayres stayed at Bow street during the late 17th century, as did the playwright William Wycherley. The actor-manager David Garrick lived at No. 6 between 1742 and 1744 while Charles Macklin stayed in the street between 1743 and 1748.

Will&#x27;s Coffee House was founded at No. 71 Bow Street in 1671 by William Urvin. It became popular during the 1690s, extending to No. 20 Russell Street, and survived until 1751.

Many residents moved away from Bow Street after the theatre was established in the early 18th century. Life in the street declined and became known for pornography and prostitution. The publisher Edmund Curll lived at No. 2 during this time, and by 1740 the street held 8 pubs, concealing a number of brothels. In 1833, the Commissioners of Woods, Forest and Land Revenues were looking to buy land on and around Bow Street, and discovered that James Robinson, lessee to the Duke of Bedford, was running a brothel there. In the following legal dispute, Robinson&#x27;s legal team accused the Commissioner&#x27;s surveyor of being prejudiced against prostitution. The building was demolished, but made little difference to the area&#x27;s reputation. In 1844, a resident suggested the street should be renamed as a continuation of Wellington Street to distance itself from the reputation Bow Street had acquired.

===Law===

Bow Street&#x27;s character changed during the 18th century to cover police and law. No. 4, originally built by James Browne in 1703–4, served as a magistrates&#x27; court from 1740. The forerunner of the modern police force, the Bow Street Runners, were founded there by novelist and dramatist Henry Fielding around 1750, after he assembled a group of volunteers who would be paid for securing convictions and could take private commission or rewards. Fielding called them &quot;thief-takers&quot;, but the Bow Street Runner name did not appear until later in the century. Following his death, Fielding was succeeded by his half-brother John.

Many of the early records of the Bow Street Runners were destroyed in the Gordon Riots of 1780, when the magistrates&#x27; court became a target. Records of arrest history and convictions were burned to expunge the rioters&#x27; criminal records.

In 1832, the Metropolitan Police Service built a new station house on the site of Nos. 33–34. This did not include the Bow Street Runners, who retained their own identity until the organisation disbanded in 1839. A new magistrates&#x27; court was designed by John Taylor at a cost of £38,400 (now £) and constructed between 1879 and 1881. Oscar Wilde was arrested and charged with gross indecency at the court in 1895; following an overnight stay on remand, he ordered tea, toast and eggs from the nearby Tavistock Hotel, who delivered them to his cell. In 1961, Bertrand Russell, then aged 89, was brought to the court after demonstrating as part of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. He later spent a week at Brixton Prison. The courts closed in July 2006 as its Grade II listing meant it was not economical to update it to modern standards. The building was then sold and converted into a boutique hotel and a police museum, both of which opened in May 2021.

===Theatre===
The Royal Opera House fronts onto Bow Street. 

There has been a theatre on or near Bow Street since the first opened in 1732, designed by Edward Shepherd for the actor John Rich. Rich also lived on Bow Street between 1754 and 1761. The presence of the theatre gave the area a reputation for prostitution and changed the character of Bow Street. The first theatre was destroyed by fire in 1808, and a second building, designed by Robert Smirke, opened the following year, but was also destroyed by fire in 1856. The third building was designed by Edward Middleton Barry and opened in 1858. The Floral Hall, part of Barry&#x27;s redevelopment, was badly damaged by fire in 1956, but the remainder survived through the 20th century. A £9.75 million modernisation and extension scheme took place between 1994 and 2000, including a reconstruction of the Floral Hall.

===Later history===
In March 1919, a riot broke out on Bow Street after around 2,000 overseas World War I servicemen awaiting demobilisation clashed with local police. Four Canadian servicemen were later charged with incitement to riot. The event was dubbed in the media as the &quot;Battle of Bow Street&quot;.

The Design Council, a charity promoting modern design of buildings, including accessibility for the disabled, has been based at No. 34 Bow Street since 1994.

==Cultural references==
Bow Street Police Station is mentioned in the Sherlock Holmes story &quot;The Man with the Twisted Lip&quot;. At the station, Holmes reveals that the beggar Hugh Boone is the aristocrat Neville St. Clair in disguise.

Bow Street is one of the streets on the British version of the game Monopoly, which is based in London. It forms a group with Marlborough Street and Vine Street, all of which have connections to the police and law.

<text>Rodney Allen Brooks (born 30 December 1954) is an Australian roboticist, Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science, author, and robotics entrepreneur, most known for popularizing the actionist approach to robotics. He was a Panasonic Professor of Robotics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He is a founder and former Chief Technical Officer of iRobot and co-founder, Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of Rethink Robotics (formerly Heartland Robotics) and is the co-founder and Chief Technical Officer of Robust.AI (founded in 2019).

==Life==
Brooks received an M.A. in pure mathematics from Flinders University of South Australia. In 1981, he received a PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University under the supervision of Thomas Binford. He has held research positions at Carnegie Mellon University and MIT and a faculty position at Stanford University. He joined the MIT faculty in 1984. He was Panasonic Professor of Robotics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (1997–2007), previously the &quot;Artificial Intelligence Laboratory&quot;.

In 1997, Brooks and his work were featured in the film &quot;Fast, Cheap &amp; Out of Control&quot;.

Brooks became a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for contributions to the foundations and applications of robotics, including establishing consumer and hazardous environment robotics industries.

==Work==
===Academic work===

Instead of computation as the ultimate conceptual metaphor that helped artificial intelligence become a separate discipline in the scientific community, he proposed that &quot;action&quot; or &quot;behavior&quot; is more appropriate to be used in robotics. Critical of applying the computational metaphor, even to the fields where the action metaphor is more relevant, he wrote in 2008 that:

Some of my colleagues have managed to recast Pluto&#x27;s orbital behavior as the body itself carrying out computations on forces that apply to it. I think we are perhaps better off using Newtonian mechanics (with a little Einstein thrown in) to understand and predict the orbits of planets and others. It is so much simpler.

In his 1990 paper, &quot;Elephants Don&#x27;t Play Chess&quot;, Brooks argued that for robots to accomplish everyday tasks in an environment shared by humans, their higher cognitive abilities, including abstract thinking emulated by symbolic reasoning, need to be based on the primarily sensory-motor coupling (action) with the environment, complemented by the proprioceptive sense which is a critical component in hand–eye coordination, pointing out that:
Over time there&#x27;s been a realization that vision, sound-processing, and early language are maybe the keys to how our brain is organized.

===Industrial work===
Brooks was an entrepreneur before leaving academia to found Rethink Robotics. He was one of ten founders of Lucid Inc., and worked with them until the company&#x27;s closure in 1993. Before Lucid closed, Brooks had founded iRobot with former students Colin Angle and Helen Greiner.

===Robots===

He experimented with off-the-shelf components, such as Fischertechnik and Lego, and tried to make robots self-replicate by putting together clones of themselves using the components. His robots include mini-robots used in oil wells explorations without cables, the robots that searched for survivors at Ground Zero in New York, and the robots used in medicine doing robotic surgery.

;Allen
In the late 1980s, Brooks and his team introduced Allen, a robot using subsumption architecture. Brooks&#x27; work focused on engineering intelligent robots to operate in unstructured environments and understanding human intelligence through building humanoid robots.

;Baxter

Introduced in 2012 by Rethink Robotics, an industrial robot named Baxter was intended as the robotic analogue of the early personal computer designed to safely interact with neighbouring human workers and be programmable for the performance of simple tasks. The robot stops if it encounters a human in the way of its robotic arm and has a prominent off switch that its human partner can push if necessary. Costs were projected to be the equivalent of a worker making $4 an hour.

===AI===
In June 2024, Brooks said GenAI is overrated.

<text>The Indian prawn (&quot;Fenneropenaeus indicus&quot;, formerly &quot;Penaeus indicus&quot;) is one of the major commercial prawn species of the world. It is found in the Indo-West Pacific from eastern and south-eastern Africa, through India, Malaysia and Indonesia to southern China and northern Australia. Adult shrimp grow to a length of about and live on the seabed to depths of about . The early developmental stages take place in the sea before the larvae move into estuaries. They return to the sea as sub-adults.

The Indian prawn is used for human consumption and is the subject of a sea fishery, particularly in China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. It is also the subject of an aquaculture industry, the main countries involved in this being Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Iran and India. For this, wild seed is collected or young shrimps are reared in hatcheries and kept in ponds as they grow. The ponds may be either extensive with reliance on natural foods, with rice paddy fields being used in India after the monsoon period, or semi-intensive or intensive, with controlled feeding. Harvesting is by drainage of the pond.

&quot;F. indicus&quot; is known by many common names around the world, including &quot;Indian white prawn&quot;, &quot;Tugela prawn&quot;, &quot;white prawn&quot;, &quot;banana prawn&quot;, &quot;Indian banana prawn&quot; and &quot;red leg banana prawn&quot;, some of which may also apply to the related species &quot;Fenneropenaeus merguiensis&quot;. The name &quot;white shrimp&quot; may also refer to other species.

==Ecology and life cycle==
&quot;F. indicus&quot; is a marine decapod with estuarine juveniles. It prefers mud or sandy mud at depths of . It grows to and has a life span of 18 months. After hatching, free-swimming nauplii are obtained, which further passes through protozoea, mysis and then to postlarval stage, which resembles the adult prawn. The postlarvae migrate to the estuaries, feed and grow until they attain a length of 110–120 mm, and these sub adults return to the sea and get recruited into fishery. It is also commonly used in shrimp farming.

==Fisheries and aquaculture==
The world&#x27;s production of shrimp is about 6 million tonnes, of which approximately 3.4 million tonnes is contributed by capture fisheries and 2.4 tonnes by aquaculture. China and four other Asian countries, including India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, together account for 55% of the capture fisheries.
Among the shrimp, the contribution of &quot;F. indicus&quot; to global fisheries was around 2.4%, and to global farmed shrimp production was 1.2% in 2005. Currently &quot;F. indicus&quot; is mainly cultured in Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, Islamic Republic of Iran and India. Saudi Arabia was the largest producer in 2005 at nearly 11,300 tonnes with Vietnam not far behind with 10,000 tonnes. In India &quot;F. indicus&quot; farming declined from 5200 tonnes in 2000 to 1100 tonnes in 2005 due to preference of farmers for &quot;P. monodon&quot;.

===Fishery===
In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Indian prawn to its seafood red list. Although the Indian prawn itself is not threatened, the methods used to capture it result in a large amount of bycatch, which includes endangered species such as sea turtles.

===Aquaculture===
Production cycle of &quot;F. indicus&quot; follows the same steps as for other species of shrimp, i.e., seed production and Grow-out of the post larvae to marketable size. The sources of seeds and grow-out techniques can be differed as desired by the farmer to achieve a balance between the cost of production and the desired quantity of output.

====Supply of seeds====
Seeds can be obtained from the wild or by establishment of hatcheries. In traditional paddy field systems the juveniles which have congregated near the sluice gates are allowed to enter the field with the incoming high tide. Among the prawn species entering the field &quot;F. indicus&quot; constitute around 36%–43%. Earlier wild seeds were also collected and sold to shrimp farmers. Nowadays the dependence on wild seed has been reduced due to establishment of hatcheries and also due to reduction in wild seeds due to overfishing.

====Broodstock====
Intensification of cultured shrimp is limited by seed supply. The production of seeds in hatcheries depends on the availability of broodstock and quality of spawners. Spawners for seed production can be obtained from the wild or can be developed by induced maturation in hatcheries.

Matured individuals can be collected from the wild during their peak spawning seasons in March/April and July/August in the tropics. A temperature range of and salinity of 30‰–35‰ is ideal for spawning.

Although hatcheries in the developing countries still depend on wild seed, maturation can be induced by eyestalk ablation technique where eyestalks of females are unilaterally ablated to stimulate endocrine activity. The ablated females spawn after 4 days, with a peak observed at days 5–6. However it is expensive to raise spawners in captivity and ablated shrimps result in less hardy fry with low survival rate. Even though the fecundity of the ablated females may not differ significantly, the hatch rates of ablated females was found to be markedly less (37.8% to 58.1%) than that of unablated females (69.2%). It is also found that wild females are more fecund per unit weight than ablated females. However quantitatively the number of spawns, eggs and nauplii produced by ablated females is ten, eight and six times respectively that of unablated females.

The size of females used for broodstock and spawning should preferably be above be and males above , as they mature at approximately and respectively.

====Hatchery====
Circular tanks of 2–5 tonnes capacity are used to rear larvae from nauplius to mysis stage. The salinity of water is maintained at around 32‰ and pH at 8.2. Feed is not provided to nauplius as it is a non-feeding stage. The protozoea stage is supplied with a mixed culture of diatoms dominated by &quot;Chaetoceros spp.&quot; or &quot;Skeletonema spp.&quot; at a concentration on around 30,000 to 40,000 cells per ml. The best algal density promoting highest survival, growth and fastest larval development is around 60–70 cells per μL. From the mysis stage they are also fed with artemia nauplii and egg-prawn-custard mix. Post larval rearing can be continued in the same tank and post-larvae (PL) are fed with minced mussel meat, mantis shrimp powder or variety of other fresh feeds of particle size 200–1000 μm till they reach PL-20 (day 20 of post-larva). After PL-20 stage they can be stocked directly into grow-out ponds without acclimatization.

====Grow-out techniques====
Grow-out techniques can be extensive, semi-intensive or intensive.

=====Extensive=====
This is the traditional system of shrimp farming which involves stocking of the wild seed with incoming tidal water is practiced in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Philippines, and Vietnam. On the southwest coast of India, low-lying coastal paddy fields are used for growing salinity tolerant variety of paddy called ‘pokkali’ and shrimp farming is carried out post monsoon during November to April. It takes an average of 150–180 days for a single crop to be ready to harvest. The estimated production of prawn-cum-paddy culture varies from 400 to 1200 kg/ha for six months period. &quot;F. indicus&quot; forms about 36%–43% of the total yield of shrimp which can go up to 400–900 kg/ha/yr. Extensive culture can be made more productive by construction of artificial ponds, use of aeration and supplementing with artificial diet. This can increase the productivity to 871.5 kg/ha/320 days in mixed culture of prawns. Monoculture of &quot;F.indicus&quot; can yield a net profit of up to Rs.8000 (approx. US$180–200) per hectare per annum for 2 crops.

=====Semi-intensive=====
Compared with traditional type of management, semi-intensive production are on a relatively smaller scale with 0.2–2 hectare ponds and also deeper 1.0–1.5 m. Stock densities can range from 20–25 PL/m2 using hatchery derived seeds for monoculture. Natural feeds are grown by application of fertilizers and supplementary feeds are also given during the culture at a rate of 4–5 times a day. Water exchange at the rate of 30%–40% is carried out using pumps. Supplementary aeration is also provided using 4–6 aerators per hectare. A culture period may last from 100–150 days depending on various factors.

=====Intensive=====
Intensive farming is tightly controlled system of farming with very less dependence on natural foods and high level of mechanization. The ponds are also usually very small (0.1–1 ha), and the stocking density very high (50–100 PL/m2). Water exchange of around 30% daily is essential to avoid degradation of water due to high stocking density and feeding rate (5–7 times/day). Production level of around 10,000–20,000 kg/ha/yr can be achieved. A culture period lasts from 120–140 days.

====Harvesting====
In traditional farming harvesting is done by fitting conical nets on the sluice gates and opening them during low tide. The shrimp are trapped in the net as the water recedes. The remaining shrimp are harvested by cast netting. In semi-intensive and intensive practices, harvesting is done by complete draining of the pond. The rest of the shrimp are collected by hand.

===Production costs and market value===
Production cost depends on type of culture used, scale of production, number of production cycles per year, etc. It is estimated that seed production cost was US$1.6/1000. The cost of adult shrimp can range from US$4–5/kg.

The Indian shrimp has a relatively lower market value than &quot;P. monodon&quot;. Average price of white shrimp is US$5.5/kg for a size range of 21/25 shrimps per kg, while for &quot;P. monodon&quot; it is US7-13/kg. However, as &quot;F. indicus&quot; is more easily bred and reared, the relative profit gained by &quot;F.indicus&quot; may be higher per input than it seems from the above figures.

Traditionally the shrimp are exported as head-on, headless, tail-on or frozen in blocks. The profit can be increased by value-addition to the shrimp in the form of shrimp pickles, cutlets, battered, ready-to-cook, etc.

<text>CVA-01 was a proposed United Kingdom aircraft carrier, designed during the 1960s. The ship was intended to be the first of a class that would replace all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s carriers, most of which had been designed before or during the Second World War. CVA-01 and CVA-02 were intended to replace and , while CVA-03 and CVA-04 would have replaced and respectively.

The planned four carrier class was soon reduced to three before further being reduced to two and finally, following a government review, in the form of the 1966 Defence White Paper, the project was cancelled, along with the proposed Type 82 destroyer class, which were intended primarily as escorts for carrier groups. Factors contributing to the cancellation of CVA-01 included inter-service rivalries, the huge financial costs of the proposed carrier against ongoing budgetary constraints, and the technical complexity and difficulties it would have presented in construction, operation, and maintenance. Some historians also cite the increased role played by land-based aircraft in providing a nuclear deterrent and that naval leadership at the time presented their need for the carriers poorly in government.

Had CVA-01 and CVA-02 been built, it is likely they would have been named HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; and HMS &quot;Duke of Edinburgh&quot; respectively.

==Origin==
In the 1960s, the Royal Navy was still one of the premier carrier fleets in the world, second only to the US Navy, which was in the process of building the 80,000-ton s.

The British fleet included the fleet carriers and , and two smaller carriers, the completely reconstructed , and the somewhat newer light carrier , both with 3D Type 984 radar and C3, but limited to air groups of 25 aircraft: at the most 20 fighters and strike aircraft and five helicopters, or alternately 16 fighters and strike aircraft, four turboprop Fairey Gannet AEW, and five helicopters. A fifth carrier, , was modernised to the minimum standard to operate second-generation Supermarine Scimitars and de Havilland Sea Vixens in 1959, but was never satisfactory or safe for operating nuclear strike aircraft and was a purely interim capability while &quot;Eagle&quot; was refitting.

While all four of the Navy&#x27;s large carriers were capable of operating the S.2 version of the Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft, only &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Eagle&quot; were realistically big enough to accommodate both a squadron of Buccaneers (up to 14 aircraft) and a squadron of redesigned McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantoms, which the Royal Navy intended to procure as its new fleet air defence aircraft. With the remainder of the air group, this would give a total of approximately 40 aircraft, which compared poorly to the 90 available to a &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot;-class ship. The increasing weight and size of modern jet fighters meant that a larger deck area was required for takeoffs and landings. Although the Royal Navy had come up with increasingly innovative ways to allow ever-larger aircraft to operate from the small flight decks of their carriers, the limited physical life left in the existing ships (only &quot;Hermes&quot; was considered capable of reliable and efficient extension past 1975), and the inability of both &quot;Victorious&quot; and &quot;Hermes&quot;, the most effectively and expensively modernised of the carriers, to operate the F-4 or an effective and useful number of Buccaneers, made the order of at least two new large fleet carriers essential by the mid-1960s.

== Design ==
=== Considerations ===

Once the Chiefs of Staff had given their approval to the idea of new carriers being necessary, in January 1962 in the strategic paper COS(621)1 &quot;British Strategy in the Sixties&quot;, the Admiralty Board had to sift through six possible designs. These ranged from 42,000 to 68,000 tons at full load. The largest design, based on the American , had space for four full-sized steam catapults but was rejected early on as being significantly too costly, particularly in terms of the dockyard upgrades that would be needed to service them.

The advantages of size were immediately apparent; a 42,000-ton carrier could only hold 27 aircraft, while a 55,000-ton carrier could carry 49 Buccaneers or Sea Vixens. This was an 80% increase in the size of the air group for a 30% increase in displacement. The Board of Admiralty decided in 1961 that the minimum would be 48,000 tons. The carriers would have two main roles: strike carrier (including attacks on airfields) and defence of the fleet. They would also operate early warning aircraft and - later - anti-submarine helicopters. Even with these smaller designs, the cost was a serious issue. The Treasury and the Air Ministry were pushing for a new set of long-range strike aircraft operating from a string of bases around the globe. For the former, this appeared a cost-effective solution for the East of Suez issue, and for the latter, it meant that the Royal Navy would not get a majority of the defence budget. 

Four ships were planned but the addition of construction of four Polaris missile nuclear submarines (ordered in April 1963) introduced delays of ten months in expected production. Considerations included the availability of berths at shipyards, sufficient trained welders for use of QT35 steel, drawing office capacity at the shipyards, number of electrical fitters. A new dry dock at Portsmouth was also needed. 

By July 1963 it was announced that only one carrier would be built, though there was a possibility that one would be ordered by the Australian Navy.

=== Details ===
The &quot;sketch&quot; approved by the Admiralty in July 1963 was for a , at the waterline, vessel. Three shafts powered by a new steam plant design would give 27-28 knots and one shaft could be shut down at a time for maintenance. The electrical distribution system, using step-down transformers from 3.3kV, was also new to the Royal Navy. 

The CVA-01 would have displaced no more than 54,500 tons, with a flight deck length (including the bridle arrester boom) of and wide. Overall width was . The size of the flight deck, combined with steam catapults and arrester gear would have enabled the carriers to operate the latest jets. The two long catapults, which could operate aircraft of maximum weight of were set at 4 degrees apart. There were four take-off positions to operate V/STOL aircraft.

Initially, no armour was planned but was added to the magazines, ship sides, and hangar bringing displacement up to 54,500 tons.

The sketch included 30 Buccaneer strike and Sea Vixen fighter aircraft. The variable geometry aircraft under design to Operational Requirement OR.346 was expected to be carried out later.

-In an Intervention Study (IWP/65) against Indonesia made in 1965, the Royal Navy assumed two carriers, CVA-01 and HMS Hermes (R12) operating 400 nautical miles off the southern coast of Java, would have 31 Buccaneers (24 for CVA-01 and 7 for Hermes) and 24 Phantoms (12 for CVA-01 and 12 for Hermes) to take on the Indonesian air force of the mid-1970&#x27;s equipped with 20 Tu-16 Badger bombers and 20 Yak-28 Brewer bombers, deployed at six airfields.

The aircraft complement in the design approved on 27 January 1966 was a mix of 36 British specification McDonnell Douglas Phantom II fleet defence fighters (with secondary strike role) and Blackburn Buccaneer low-level strike aircraft, four early-warning aircraft, five anti-submarine helicopters, and two search-and-rescue helicopters.

Defences included an Ikara anti-submarine system and a Sea Dart anti-aircraft missile (then under development) on the quarterdeck. The Ikara was deleted from the design in February 1965.

The large &#x27;Broomstick&#x27; radar dome above the central island on the carrier was planned to be a Type 988 Anglo-Dutch 3D radar, which would subsequently be fitted on the Royal Netherlands Navy s, although this would not have been fitted to the final carrier as Britain pulled out of the project.

==Cancellation==
In mid-1963 the Minister of Defence Peter Thorneycroft announced in Parliament that one new aircraft carrier would be built, at an estimated cost of £60 million, although the Treasury thought that the final cost was likely to be nearer £100 million. This was based on the carrier using the same aircraft as the Royal Air Force, the Hawker Siddeley P.1154 supersonic V/STOL aircraft (a larger version of what would become the Hawker Siddeley Harrier). The single new carrier would be part of a three carrier fleet with a refitted Eagle and Hermes until 1980. After the General Election of October 1964, however, the new Labour Government wanted to cut back defence spending, and the RAF attacked the Royal Navy&#x27;s carrier in an attempt to safeguard first its BAC TSR-2 strike/reconnaissance aircraft and then its proposed replacement, the General Dynamics F-111, from the cuts.

The new government, and by extension the Treasury, were particularly concerned about the size issues involved, as these were fluctuating quite frequently. They, therefore, demanded that the Admiralty keep to 53,000 tons. With the navy unwilling to alter the size of the carrier and its air group accordingly the difficulties spiraled, and the final tonnage was much more likely to be nearer 55,000 tons. The design issues also increased, including dramatically reduced top speed, deck space, armour, and radar equipment. When the Cabinet met in February 1966, the new Secretary of State for Defence, Denis Healey, strongly supported the RAF and their plan for long-range strike aircraft, by now the F-111, partially due to the cost issues of running fleet carriers, and partially due to opposition to a strong British military. This meeting resulted in the 1966 Defence White Paper. In this paper, the CVA-01 was finally canceled, along with the remainder of the Type 82 destroyers that would have been built as escorts, of which only was eventually completed. Instead, plans were made for the modernisation of &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. The final chief designer of CVA-01 said that by the time project was cancelled, so many design compromises had been made because of size and budget restrictions, that the whole project had become risky. The following year, a supplement to the review marked the ending of a global presence with the withdrawal of British presence &quot;East of Suez&quot;. The year after, the purchase of F-111s was cancelled.

One argument about the cancellation of CVA-01 states that the RAF moved Australia by 500 miles in its documents to support the air force&#x27;s preferred strategy of land-based aircraft. Regardless of the story&#x27;s veracity, the principal reason for the cancellation was that the Defence Review Board believed adequate cover could be better provided East of Suez by RAF strike aircraft flying from bases in Australia and uninhabited islands in the Indian Ocean, rather than by a small carrier fleet in the 1970s which would have still included &quot;Hermes&quot;. The Review asserted the carrier&#x27;s only effective use was to project British power East of Suez, and that the RN carriers were too &#x27;vulnerable&#x27; for the RN&#x27;s other major theatre in the North Atlantic. When the British government later decided in 1967 that it would withdraw from east of Suez, the case for carriers weakened further. The 1966 Review stated that the ability of the RAF to cover 300 miles offshore was enough for the 1970s, regardless of the RAF&#x27;s contested claim of being able to provide air cover out to 700 miles. The cancellation of 150 TSR2 aircraft by Labour in mid-1965 was the basis of the RAF&#x27;s argument for the &#x27;island hopping strategy&#x27;.

==Subsequent Royal Navy carriers==


===&quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot;===

The cancellation of CVA-01 was planned to be compensated for by the minimum updating of both &quot;Eagle&quot; and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to enable them to operate the 52 Phantoms ordered. However, a decision was taken later to completely phase out fixed-wing flying in the Royal Navy by 1972 in line with withdrawal from &quot;East of Suez&quot;. &quot;Victorious&quot; was withdrawn in 1969 and &quot;Hermes&quot; was converted to a &quot;commando carrier&quot; to replace her sister &quot;Albion&quot;, in 1971-73.

At the time of the announcement, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was beginning a reconstruction with an austere refit of radar systems, communications, partial electrical rewiring, and fittings needed to allow operation of the Phantom (despite the fact that it was a worse base for such a conversion than &quot;Eagle&quot;), and it was deemed unacceptable either to cancel the much-needed work, or to spend such a large amount of money (approx. £32m) for less than three years continued use. A change of government led, as a consequence, to retain &quot;Ark Royal&quot; following her 1967–1970 refit, but not to proceed with a refit of &quot;Eagle&quot;. &quot;Eagle&quot; was decommissioned in 1972, partly due to damage inflicted in a partial grounding a year before; repairs would have probably required a minimum 18-month refit in 1972–1973 at a cost of around £40 million to operate till 1977. Many of the second squadron of F-4 Phantoms intended for &quot;Eagle&quot; were immediately transferred to the RAF. &quot;Eagle&quot; remained officially in reserve as a source of spares to maintain &quot;Ark Royal&quot; until 1978, but could never have been brought back into service.

===&quot;Through Deck Cruiser&quot;===

The Royal Navy did not however completely surrender aircraft carrier capability, despite the eventual withdrawal of &quot;Ark Royal&quot; in 1978. The concept of the &quot;through-deck command cruiser&quot; was first raised in the late 1960s when it became clear that there was a good chance of the Fleet Air Arm losing fixed-wing capability. The &quot;through-deck cruiser&quot; name was chosen to avoid the stigma of great expense attached to full-size aircraft carriers, with these 20,000-ton ships having significantly less fixed-wing aviation capability than the planned CVA-01 carriers. However, they were to function as part of combined NATO fleets, with a primary mission of providing Cold War anti-submarine helicopter patrols in the north-east Atlantic Ocean, in support of the American carrier battle groups of NATO&#x27;s &quot;Forward Maritime Strategy&quot;. Three Invincible-class aircraft carriers were built.

In order to ensure the safety of the battle group around the &quot;cruiser&quot;, the facility to carry the Sea Harrier was added at a late stage of development, the intention being that it could give the battle group the capability to intercept Soviet reconnaissance aircraft without having to rely either on land-based or US Navy interceptors. The ultimate result of this was the Royal Navy being able to deploy carrier-based aircraft during the Falklands War. One officer who worked on the CVA-01 believed, however, that had the United Kingdom &quot;built two or three ships to this design, they would now [in 1999] be seen to have been the bargain of the century and they would have made the Falklands War a much less risky operation&quot; due to greater functionality.

===CVF===

The United Kingdom returned to the fleet carrier idea with the construction of the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers, which are larger than the cancelled CVA-01s. The two new carriers, initially dubbed CVF (F for &#x27;Future&#x27;), are named and . The contract for these vessels was announced on 25 July 2007 by the Secretary of State for Defence Des Browne. Following &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;&#x27;s commissioning on 7 December 2017, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was commissioned on 10 December 2019.

<text>Sheriffhales is a scattered village in Shropshire, England, north-east of Telford, north of Shifnal and south of Newport. The name derives from Halh (Anglican) and scīr-rēfa (Old English) which is a combination of Hales (a nook of land, small valley) and Sheriff (a king&#x27;s executive). At the time of the Domesday Book, it was held by Roger de Balliol the Sheriff of Shropshire.

As well as Sheriffhales itself, the modern civil parish of Sheriffhales includes the smaller settlements of [[Lilyhurst]], Burlington, Heath Hill, Weston Heath, [[Redhill, Shropshire|Redhill]] and [[Chadwell, Shropshire|Chadwell]]. The parish has a population of about 700 people, however it reached 1019 people in 1850, when the Duke of Sutherland owned most of it. The village was in Staffordshire until 1895 when the border between Staffordshire and Shropshire was moved. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 722.

Despite being a small village of around 100 people, there is a primary school, a Church of England church (St Mary&#x27;s) and a local post office, as well as a playing field with football goals and a children&#x27;s playground. The church is a Grade II listed building that dates back to the 12th century.

Between 1663 and 1697, when its founder moved to London, Sheriffhales was home to a dissenting academy run by nonconformist minister John Woodhouse.

Sheriffhales was the site of the World War II PoW Camp 71, located along the drive to Lilleshall Hall. The camp was intended for Italian Prisoners of War and housed up to 2,000 until Italy surrendered in 1943; thereafter it was used to house German PoW&#x27;s until 1948 when most were repatriated.

The 2007 Tour of Britain bike race passed through the village on the first of September as part of the Wolverhampton to Birmingham stage.

The main farm within the village, Meadow Farm, was a predominantly dairy farm, but has been subsequently converted into an arable farm. It is also the centre for a point to point yard.

Sheriffhales is mentioned (under the name &quot;Hales&quot;) in the Ellis Peters novel &quot;The Confession of Brother Haluin&quot;.

Hope Vere Anderson is Lord of the Manor of Sheriffhales and descends from the senior branch of the Hope Vere&#x27;s of Lesmahagow, Scotland. The Hope Vere&#x27;s trace their ancestry to Roger De Vere who was Lord of the Manor of Hales and when he became Sheriff of Shropshire in the 16th century he changed the name of his Manor from that of Hales to Sheriffhales to reflect his importance in being appointed to this additional role.

<doc id="632533" wikidata="Q4572283" url="?curid=632533" title="1966 Defence White Paper">
<text>The 1966 Defence [[White Paper]] (Command Papers 2592 and 2901) was a major review of the United Kingdom&#x27;s defence policy initiated by the Labour government under Prime Minister Harold Wilson. The review was led by the Secretary of State for Defence, Denis Healey. The document was centred on the need to support NATO in Europe and made the commitment that the UK, &quot;would not undertake major operations of war except in co-operation with allies.&quot; The 1966 announcements undertook to retain the UK presence in Singapore and Malaysia.

However, the mid-late sixties brought an economic crisis and the devaluation of pound sterling. In 1967 and 1968, the government published two further supplements to the review, announcing the strategic withdrawal of British forces deployed &quot;East of Suez&quot;. This marked a watershed in British foreign policy and the end of a major, enduring world-wide military role.

==Contents==
The Wilson Government decided on significant reductions in the defence budget, with defence being the primary target of the government&#x27;s efforts to reduce public spending due to wider economic problems. The outcome of the Review resulted in cutting a number of significant new capital projects, including the CVA-01 aircraft carrier and all but one of the Type 82 destroyers. This was to be part of a phased removal of aircraft carrier capability. Instead, investment would be made in aircraft including the Harrier, the Anglo-French AFVG (which later came to fruition as the Panavia Tornado) and the American F-111 bomber (the latter following the cancellation of the TSR-2 program).

In order to concentrate forces in Europe in support of NATO, the review also recommended withdrawal of the British presence in Aden. The 1967 supplement added accelerated withdrawals from Singapore, Malaysia, Malta, Libya and the Persian Gulf, reversing the election commitment to retaining an East of Suez military role. The 1968 supplement additionally cancelled the order for the F-111.

==Inter-service rivalry and the defence budget==
In the early 1960s, the Royal Navy began to plan for new aircraft carriers to replace its aging fleet. The Royal Air Force saw the renewal as a chance to win the budget share which would have been necessary for new carriers. The RAF compiled a history of Royal Navy aircraft carriers and a history of Royal Air Force tactical bombers, comparing the two and finding in favour of bombers. They then submitted this to the Treasury, proposing the TSR-2 tactical strike aircraft in place of the RN&#x27;s new generation aircraft carriers. Professor Andrew Lambert has described the 1966 Defence White Paper as the &#x27;perfect example of what happens if your enemy knows your history better than you do&#x27;, with the RAF&#x27;s projects doing better in the 1966 review than the Royal Navy&#x27;s.

Dr. Jeffrey Bradford, research director of the United Kingdom Defence Forum wrote a paper as part of a doctoral research programme covering in detail the inter-service rivalry surrounding the procurement effort for the CVA-01 against the backdrop of the defence reviews of the mid 1960s

==Implementation==
All British forces were withdrawn from Aden by the end of November 1967, despite the ongoing Aden Emergency. Along with the withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, this left bases in Oman as the only UK installations in the Middle East by the mid-seventies. The final installations, the RAF bases at Salalah and on Masirah Island, closed in 1976 following the end of the Dhufar rebellion.

In the Far East, the bulk of British forces left Singapore following a ceremony involving 20 ships including aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; in October 1971. Security for Singapore and Malaysia was partially handed to Australian and New Zealand forces as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements, which are still in place today. The British Far East Command was terminated on 31 October 1971, although a smaller British presence remained in the area until 1976. British forces also remained based in Hong Kong and Brunei.

Both the F-111 order and the AFVG bombers were later cancelled, although the latter evolved into the Panavia Tornado, which was delivered in 1979 and was still in service with the RAF in 2018. One Type 82 Destroyer was built, HMS &quot;Bristol&quot;, as a test-bed for new technologies. No new large aircraft carriers were built, although naval aviation continued with the construction of smaller &quot;Invincible&quot;-class aircraft carriers during the 1970s.

<text>Numerical Recipes is the generic title of a series of books on algorithms and numerical analysis by William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling and Brian P. Flannery. In various editions, the books have been in print since 1986. The most recent edition was published in 2007.

==Overview==
The &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; books cover a range of topics that include both classical numerical analysis (interpolation, integration, linear algebra, differential equations, and so on), signal processing (Fourier methods, filtering), statistical treatment of data, and a few topics in machine learning (hidden Markov model, support vector machines). The writing style is accessible and has an informal tone. The emphasis is on understanding the underlying basics of techniques, not on the refinements that may, in practice, be needed to achieve optimal performance and reliability. Few results are proved with any degree of rigor, although the ideas behind proofs are often sketched, and references are given. Importantly, virtually all methods that are discussed are also implemented in a programming language, with the code printed in the book. Each variant of the book is keyed to a specific language.

According to the publisher, Cambridge University Press, the &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; books are historically the all-time best-selling books on scientific programming methods. In recent years, &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; books have been cited in the scientific literature more than 3000 times per year according to ISI Web of Knowledge (e.g., 3962 times in the year 2008). And as of the end of 2017, the book had over 44000 citations on Google Scholar.

==History==
The first publication was in 1986 with the title,”Numerical Recipes, The Art of Scientific Computing”, containing code in both Fortran and Pascal; an accompanying book, “Numerical Recipes Example Book (Pascal)” was first published in 1985. (A preface note in “Examples&quot; mentions that the main book was also published in 1985, but the official note in that book says 1986.) Supplemental editions followed with code in Pascal, BASIC, and C. &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; took, from the start, an opinionated editorial position at odds with the conventional wisdom of the numerical analysis community:

However, as it turned out, the 1980s were fertile years for the &quot;black box&quot; side, yielding important libraries such as BLAS and LAPACK, and integrated environments like MATLAB and Mathematica. By the early 1990s, when Second Edition versions of &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; (with code in C, Fortran-77, and Fortran-90) were published, it was clear that the constituency for &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; was by no means the majority of scientists doing computation, but only that slice that lived &quot;between&quot; the more mathematical numerical analysts and the larger community using integrated environments. The Second Edition versions occupied a stable role in this niche environment.

By the mid-2000s, the practice of scientific computing had been radically altered by the mature Internet and Web. Recognizing that their &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; books were increasingly valued more for their explanatory text than for their code examples, the authors significantly expanded the scope of the book, and significantly rewrote a large part of the text. They continued to include code, still printed in the book, now in C++, for every method discussed. The Third Edition was also released as an electronic book, eventually made available on the Web for free (with nags) or by paid or institutional subscription (with faster, full access and no nags).

In 2015 Numerical Recipes sold its historic two-letter domain name nr.com and became codice_1 instead.

==Reception==
=== Content ===
Numerical Recipes is a single volume that covers a very broad range of algorithms. Unfortunately that format skewed the choice of algorithms towards simpler and shorter early algorithms which were not as accurate, efficient or stable as later more complex algorithms. The first edition had also some minor bugs, which were fixed in later editions; however according to the authors for years they were encountering on the internet rumors that Numerical Recipes is &quot;full of bugs&quot;. They attributed this to people using outdated versions of the code, bugs in other parts of the code and misuse of routines which require some understanding to use correctly.

The rebuttal does not, however, cover criticisms regarding lack of mentions to code limitations, boundary conditions, and more modern algorithms, another theme in Snyder&#x27;s comment compilation. A precision issue in Bessel functions has persisted to the third edition according to Pavel Holoborodko.

Despite criticism by numerical analysts, engineers and scientists generally find the book conveniently broad in scope. Norman Gray concurs in the following quote:
Numerical Recipes [nr] does not claim to be a numerical analysis textbook, and it makes a point of noting that its authors are (astro-)physicists and engineers rather than analysts, and so share the motivations and impatience of the book&#x27;s intended audience. The declared premise of the NR authors is that you will come to grief one way or the other if you use numerical routines you do not understand. They attempt to give you enough mathematical detail that you understand the routines they present, in enough depth that you can diagnose problems when they occur, and make more sophisticated choices about replacements when the NR routines run out of steam. [...]

=== License ===
The code listings are copyrighted and commercially licensed by the &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; authors. A license to use the code is given with the purchase of a book, but the terms of use are highly restrictive. For example, programmers need to make sure NR code cannot be extracted from their finished programs and used – a difficult requirement with dubious enforceability.

However, &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot; does include the following statement regarding copyrights on computer programs:Copyright does not protect ideas, but only the expression of those ideas in a particular form. In the case of a computer program, the ideas consist of the program&#x27;s methodology and algorithm, including the necessary sequence of steps adopted by the programmer. The expression of those ideas is the program source code... If you analyze the ideas contained in a program, and then express those ideas in your own completely different implementation, then that new program implementation belongs to you. 

One early motivation for the GNU Scientific Library was that a free library was needed as a substitute for &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot;.

=== Style ===
Another line of criticism centers on the coding style of the books, which strike some modern readers as &quot;Fortran-ish&quot;, though written in contemporary, object-oriented C++. The authors have defended their very terse coding style as necessary to the format of the book because of space limitations and for readability.

<text>The Titanic Brewery is an independent producer of bottle conditioned and cask ales in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, England. 

Titanic&#x27;s beers are generally notable for their light colour, low malt, and high hop content, giving a very dry bitter taste, although Captain Smith&#x27;s and some of their seasonal beers are dark and malty, though still extremely hoppy. Their seasonal ranges also include lighter and fruity ales such as 2019 seasonal beer, Kiwi Fleet, which is made with New Zealand hops.

==History==
The brewery was founded in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, in 1985 by John Pazio, and is now run by brothers Keith and Dave Bott, and takes its name from the ill-fated steam liner &quot;Titanic&quot;. It is in honour of its captain Edward Smith (who came from Stoke-on-Trent) that the brewery is named.

One of the owners, Keith Bott, was formerly the chairman of SIBA, the Society of Independent Brewers.

==Products==
Its &#x27;Fleet&#x27; range of beers include:

* Plum Porter (4.9% abv)
* Titanic Mild (3.5% abv)
* Steerage (formerly Titanic Best Bitter) (3.8% abv)
* Anchor ABV (4.1% abv)
* Iceberg (4.1% abv)
* Titanic Stout (4.5% abv)
* White Star (4.5% abv)
* Captain Smith&#x27;s Strong Ale (5.2% abv)

All of these, bar the Mild are available in bottles from the brewery, the brewery tap, and supermarkets. They produce over 4 million pints every year.

Titanic have also branched out into distilling their own gin. 

==Pubs==

Titanic Brewery presently runs nine pubs in North Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Oxfordshire: The Bull&#x27;s Head in Burslem, The White Star in Stoke, The Greyhound in Newcastle-under-Lyme, The Royal Exchange in Stone, The Sun Inn in Stafford, The Roebuck in Leek, The Cheshire Cheese in Buxton, The Royal Blenheim in Oxford and the Old Poets Corner in Ashover. A recent (2024) addition is The Beacon in Lichfield. 

==Café bars==

Titanic Brewery also runs eight &#x27;Bod&#x27; café bars in the Staffordshire area: in Alsager, Lichfield, Matlock, Newport, Stafford, Stoke-on-Trent railway station, Stone and Trentham. 

==Awards==

The Titanic Brewery has won many awards, often awarded by CAMRA (the Campaign for Real Ale), from the 1990s to the present day.

The Titanic Brewery&#x27;s bottled Stout beer&#x27;s first award was Gold in the 1994 Guardian Bottled Beer of Britain, and more recently it won first place in the CAMRA West Midlands Beer of the Year 2009 (Stout Category).
Titanic&#x27;s Iceberg Beer won its first award in 2002, achieving Gold in the CAMRA Champion Beer of the West Midlands category, and again more recently achieved first place in the CAMRA West Midlands Beer of the Year (Speciality Category).

<doc id="632562" wikidata="Q2429957" url="?curid=632562" title="Thunk">
<text>In computer programming, a thunk is a subroutine used to inject a calculation into another subroutine. Thunks are primarily used to delay a calculation until its result is needed, or to insert operations at the beginning or end of the other subroutine. They have many other applications in compiler code generation and modular programming.

The term originated as a whimsical irregular form of the verb &quot;think&quot;. It refers to the original use of thunks in ALGOL 60 compilers, which required special analysis (thought) to determine what type of routine to generate.

==Background==
The early years of compiler research saw broad experimentation with different evaluation strategies. A key question was how to compile a subroutine call if the arguments can be arbitrary mathematical expressions rather than constants. One approach, known as &quot;call by value&quot;, calculates all of the arguments before the call and then passes the resulting values to the subroutine. In the rival &quot;call by name&quot; approach, the subroutine receives the unevaluated argument expression and must evaluate it.

A simple implementation of &quot;call by name&quot; might substitute the code of an argument expression for each appearance of the corresponding parameter in the subroutine, but this can produce multiple versions of the subroutine and multiple copies of the expression code. As an improvement, the compiler can generate a helper subroutine, called a &quot;thunk&quot;, that calculates the value of the argument. The address and environment of this helper subroutine are then passed to the original subroutine in place of the original argument, where it can be called as many times as needed. Peter Ingerman first described thunks in reference to the ALGOL 60 programming language, which supports call-by-name evaluation.

==Applications==

===Functional programming===
Although the software industry largely standardized on call-by-value and call-by-reference evaluation, active study of call-by-name continued in the functional programming community. This research produced a series of lazy evaluation programming languages in which some variant of call-by-name is the standard evaluation strategy. Compilers for these languages, such as the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, have relied heavily on thunks, with the added feature that the thunks save their initial result so that they can avoid recalculating it; this is known as memoization or call-by-need.

Functional programming languages have also allowed programmers to explicitly generate thunks. This is done in source code by wrapping an argument expression in an anonymous function that has no parameters of its own. This prevents the expression from being evaluated until a receiving function calls the anonymous function, thereby achieving the same effect as call-by-name. The adoption of anonymous functions into other programming languages has made this capability widely available.

===Object-oriented programming===
Thunks are useful in object-oriented programming platforms that allow a class to inherit multiple interfaces, leading to situations where the same method might be called via any of several interfaces. The following code illustrates such a situation in C++.
class A {
 public:
 virtual int Access() const { return value_; }

 private:
 int value_;

class B {
 public:
 virtual int Access() const { return value_; }

 private:
 int value_;

class C : public A, public B {
 public:
 int Access() const override { return better_value_; }

 private:
 int better_value_;

int use(B *b) { return b-&gt;Access(); }

int main() {
 B some_b;
 use(&amp;some_b);
 C some_c;
 use(&amp;some_c);


In this example, the code generated for each of the classes A, B and C will include a dispatch table that can be used to call on an object of that type, via a reference that has the same type. Class C will have an additional dispatch table, used to call on an object of type C via a reference of type B. The expression will use B&#x27;s own dispatch table or the additional C table, depending on the type of object b refers to. If it refers to an object of type C, the compiler must ensure that C&#x27;s implementation receives an instance address for the entire C object, rather than the inherited B part of that object.

As a direct approach to this pointer adjustment problem, the compiler can include an integer offset in each dispatch table entry. This offset is the difference between the reference&#x27;s address and the address required by the method implementation. The code generated for each call through these dispatch tables must then retrieve the offset and use it to adjust the instance address before calling the method.

The solution just described has problems similar to the naïve implementation of call-by-name described earlier: the compiler generates several copies of code to calculate an argument (the instance address), while also increasing the dispatch table sizes to hold the offsets. As an alternative, the compiler can generate an &quot;adjustor thunk&quot; along with C&#x27;s implementation of that adjusts the instance address by the required amount and then calls the method. The thunk can appear in C&#x27;s dispatch table for B, thereby eliminating the need for callers to adjust the address themselves.

===Interoperability===
Thunks have been widely used to provide interoperability between software modules whose routines cannot call each other directly. This may occur because the routines have different calling conventions, run in different CPU modes or address spaces, or at least one runs in a virtual machine. A compiler (or other tool) can solve this problem by generating a thunk that automates the additional steps needed to call the target routine, whether that is transforming arguments, copying them to another location, or switching the CPU mode. A successful thunk minimizes the extra work the caller must do compared to a normal call.

Much of the literature on interoperability thunks relates to various Wintel platforms, including MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows and .NET, and to the transition from 16-bit to 32-bit memory addressing. As customers have migrated from one platform to another, thunks have been essential to support legacy software written for the older platforms.

The transition from 32-bit to 64-bit code on x86 also uses a form of thunking (WoW64). However, because the x86-64 address space is larger than the one available to 32-bit code, the old &quot;generic thunk&quot; mechanism could not be used to call 64-bit code from 32-bit code. The only case of 32-bit code calling 64-bit code is in the WoW64&#x27;s thunking of Windows APIs to 32-bit.

===Overlays and dynamic linking===
On systems that lack automatic virtual memory hardware, thunks can implement a limited form of virtual memory known as overlays. With overlays, a developer divides a program&#x27;s code into segments that can be loaded and unloaded independently, and identifies the entry points into each segment. A segment that calls into another segment must do so indirectly via a branch table. When a segment is in memory, its branch table entries jump into the segment. When a segment is unloaded, its entries are replaced with &quot;reload thunks&quot; that can reload it on demand.

Similarly, systems that dynamically link modules of a program together at run-time can use thunks to connect the modules. Each module can call the others through a table of thunks that the linker fills in when it loads the module. This way the modules can interact without prior knowledge of where they are located in memory.

<text>Misspent Youth is a 2002 science fiction novel by English author Peter F. Hamilton.

== Setting ==
Set around 2040, it describes the story of Jeff Baker, an inventor who revolutionises the world by creating the ultimate method of information storage and, instead of selling it, offers it open source. Because of this act, he is chosen as the candidate for the first use of rejuvenation technology which leaves him with the body of a young man. Hamilton forms a picture of a famous man with a troubled family, living in a troubled Rutland, England – also Hamilton&#x27;s home county. This is very much a character driven story and focuses on the effects that Jeff&#x27;s rejuvenation has on his family.

The novel has received mixed reviews, with Hamilton himself best describing why: &quot;I could see why it didn&#x27;t appeal to a lot of people. It was an unpleasant story about unpleasant people. With hindsight, it was never going to be as popular as my other works.&quot;

The story envisions that after the invention of the &quot;datasphere&quot;, traditional publishing industries finally lost control on their copyright, and the development of new novels, music and movies collapsed. The United Kingdom remains a part of a more closely integrated European Union, with violent separatist movements in many member states.

==Plot ==
Seventy-eight-year-old Jeff Baker has revolutionised the world by inventing the ultimate method of information storage and allowing free use of it with no profits going into his own pocket. Because of this generous act, he is chosen by the European Union to be the first recipient for rejuvenation technology, which will leave him with the body of a young man. As part of the deal, he will support the re-election of the EU president.

His son Tim has a fairly typical frustrated life as a rich teenager, living with his famous father and distant mother. Tim is extremely happy when he starts going out with gorgeous Annabelle. She likes him, but she has a troubled home life and Tim&#x27;s drinking problem reminds her of her father.

Jeff comes home from the rejuvenation in his 20-year-old body. Energised by his new youthfulness, he has a series of affairs. After reconnecting with his son, Jeff reveals to Tim that the reason he gave away the information storage technology was so that his ex-wife could not get any royalties. The amazing act of charity he is famous for was motivated by spite, not goodwill. But Jeff finds himself attracted to Annabelle, and while giving her a ride home after Tim got too drunk at a school dance, they start a tawdry affair behind Tim&#x27;s back and fall in love. Their passionate relationship is only a secret for a short time before Tim finds them in bed together. His life falling apart, Tim runs away to live with his Aunt (Jeff&#x27;s sister), stops drinking and doing drugs, and makes friends with his mother. Eventually he finds a new romantic interest in Vanessa, one of his classmates.

Jeff and Annabelle are happy together, travelling around the world, meeting celebrities, even experimenting with a &quot;ménage à trois&quot;. However, they are sad that they have hurt Tim, who gets seriously injured in a jet-ski accident, providing a catalyst for Jeff to re-enter Tim&#x27;s life.

Jeff and Annabelle both attend a controversial EU conference in London so Jeff can speak supporting the EU. Tim and his friends join a massive and violent protest in the streets below the conference. As the riots begin, concerned for Tim&#x27;s safety, Jeff changes his mind about supporting the EU and leaves the conference to charge through the riots to find his son. Impressed by this act, Tim finds it in him to forgive his father and Annabelle.

In the end, Jeff is dying because the rejuvenation treatment is not yet a properly functional technology, and it is failing him. After arranging for Annabelle&#x27;s pregnancy with his second genetically improved child, a girl this time, he begins a live broadcast, where he reveals the lies of the EU government and rescinds his support for the presidential campaign, his family and loved ones join the broadcast. It is implied that Jeff dies during the broadcast.

==References to other works==
&quot;Misspent Youth&quot; is set in the same universe as Hamilton&#x27;s later Commonwealth Saga, consisting of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Star&quot; (2004) and &quot;Judas Unchained&quot; (2005). Jeff Baker is mentioned in the prologue to &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Star&quot; and Annabelle Goddard is also mentioned in &quot;Judas Unchained&quot;. In addition, the rejuvenation and datasphere technologies established in &quot;Misspent Youth&quot; are shown in a vastly more sophisticated form in this series. &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Star&quot; is set in 2380, approximately 340 years after the events of &quot;Misspent Youth&quot;.

Jeff&#x27;s son Tim is shown to be the President of the Commonwealth in approximately 3595 in &quot;A Night Without Stars&quot;, book 2 of The Chronicle of the Fallers.

== Publication ==
The novel was first published in the US in August 2006 in a new edition which had been re-edited for the US market.

== Reception ==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; was not very positive in their review saying that &quot;scenes of passion and parent-child conflict are not particularly interesting, and the unconvincing sentimental ending likewise disappoints.&quot;

Kirkus Reviews described the novel as &quot;Flowers for Algernon, centering on sex instead of brains.&quot;

<text>The Warnow () is a river in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany. It flows into the Baltic Sea near the town of Rostock, in its borough Warnemünde.

The source of the Warnow is in Grebbin, a small village north of Parchim, at the western end of the Mecklenburg Lake District. It flows north through Sternberg, Bützow and Schwaan before reaching Rostock.

In 2003, Germany&#x27;s first modern toll road, the Warnow Tunnel was opened, connecting the port of Rostock on the east bank with the west bank of the river.

There is in Indaial, a city of Brazil, a river with the same name. When Hermann Blumenau came to America and started to explore the country, he gave this name to the river in the Brazilian city because it resembled the river in Germany.

==Names and etymology==

The origins of the name are uncertain. Recent work suggests a non-Indo-European (perhaps specifically Hattic) element &quot;ar(i)n&quot; (&#x27;spring, stream&#x27;), giving rise to the Slavic form &quot;Warnow&quot; through the prosthesis of /v-/. The Warnabi, a medieval Slavic tribe, probably derived their name from the Warnow. The ancient geographer Claudius Ptolemäus mentioned a river around 150 CE whose location would correspond to the Warnow, which he called the Χαλοῦσος (Latin: Chalusus). The river also appears in a few medieval sources under names along the lines of &quot;Goderak&quot;: &quot;Guðakrsá&quot; (&#x27;God-field&#x27;s river&#x27;) in &quot;Knýtlinga saga&quot; chapter 119 and Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; in the phrase &quot;ad Gudacram amnem&quot; (&#x27;to the river Gudacra&#x27;; xiv.25.16). Meanwhile, Arnold of Lübeck&#x27;s &quot;Chronica Slavorum&quot; mentions that Berno, Apostle of the Obotrites &#x27;pro Gutdracco Godehardum episcopum venerari constituit&#x27; (&#x27;instituted the veneration of Bishop Godehard in place of Gutdracco&#x27;). This Gutdracco is otherwise unknown, and there is some suspicion that the name of this god arose as a folk-etymologisation of the name of the river.

<doc id="632579" wikidata="Q173435" url="?curid=632579" title="Gordon Murray">
<text>Ian Gordon Murray (born 18 June 1946), is a successful and influential South African-British former (Formula One) race-car designer, renowned firstly as lead designer for both the Brabham and McLaren Formula 1 racing teams, during 1969–1986 and 1987–1991 respectively, then as designer of high-end, high-performance sports cars and a variety of other innovative automotive projects.

After leaving McLaren, Murray founded the Gordon Murray Design consultancy and, in 2017, the low-volume specialist car manufacturing company Gordon Murray Automotive, both now incorporated into the Gordon Murray Group.

==Early life==
The child of Scottish immigrant parents, Murray was born and grew up in Durban, South Africa. His father was a motorcycle racer and later prepared racing cars. Murray studied mechanical engineering at Natal Technical College, now Durban University of Technology. 
He built and raced his own car, the IGM Ford, in the South African National Class during 1967 and 1968.

==Formula One career==

===Brabham: 1969–1986===
Murray moved to England in 1969, hoping to find a job at Lotus Cars. But Murray was offered a job at Brabham after coincidentally meeting then Brabham designer Ron Tauranac. When Bernie Ecclestone took over the Brabham team, he appointed Murray Chief Designer. There Murray designed many Grand Prix cars, some of which were World Championship Grand Prix winners. These designs include the extraordinary BT46B, also known as &quot;the Brabham fan car&quot;, as well as the World Championship winning BT49 and BT52. Murray developed a reputation for an innovative approach to design, applied not only to car concepts and details but also to race strategy.

Between 1973 and 1985, Murray&#x27;s Brabhams scored 22 Grand Prix wins, finished 2nd in the Constructors&#x27; Championship in 1975 and 1981, and gave Nelson Piquet Drivers&#x27; Championships in 1981 and 1983. For the season, Murray designed the radical and highly ambitious low-line Brabham BT55, lowering overall ride height by inclining the engine and placing the driver in a recumbent position. However, the car was not a success, finishing only seven of the sixteen races in the season.

*Brabham BT54 (1985–1986)
*Brabham BT55 (1986)

===McLaren: 1987–1991===
In 1986, Murray received an offer from Ron Dennis to join McLaren as Technical Director, taking over the role formerly held by John Barnard. Murray brought his Brabham experience to the McLaren design team, led by Chief Designer Steve Nichols. The 1988 MP4/4 car, with a Honda turbo-powered engine, won 15 of the season&#x27;s 16 Grands Prix, and gave Ayrton Senna his first Drivers&#x27; Championship. In the Constructors&#x27; Championship, McLaren&#x27;s points score of 199 was at that time an all-time high. Murray also oversaw the design of the naturally-aspirated engined 1989 MP4/5 and 1990 MP4/5B with lead designer Neil Oatley. The MP4/5 and MP4/5B won the driver&#x27;s and constructor&#x27;s championships in both years. Over the period 1988–91, the McLaren team won four consecutive Constructors&#x27; and Drivers&#x27; Championships: Alain Prost won the Drivers&#x27; Championship in 1989, while Senna won further Drivers&#x27; Championships in 1990 and 1991.

==McLaren Cars==
From 1991 to 2004, Murray headed the offshoot McLaren Cars team to design road-going supercars, starting with the McLaren F1 in 1992. In a lightly modified “LM” specification in 1995 it became the last road-legal sportscar to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race outright, across all classes, including race places 1, 3, 4 &amp; 5.

==Gordon Murray Design==
In July 2007 the Gordon Murray Design consultancy was established, and released initial details of its T.25 (Type 25) prototype city car along with mention of a future lightweight, economical supercar project. The T25 would be smaller than a Smart Fortwo. In 2008 Murray won the &#x27;Idea of the Year&#x27; accolade at &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual awards ceremony for the manufacturing process for the T.25.

In November 2009 Gordon Murray Design and Zytek Automotive announced plans to develop an electric-powered version of the T.25, the T.27. This car being a product of a partnership between Murray&#x27;s company and British technology company Zytek, in charge of building the powertrain.

The T.25 won the 2010 Royal Automobile Club’s Future Car Challenge, with a 97 miles per gallon fuel consumption over the 60 mile course from Brighton to London. The next year the T.27 won the electric car class and best overall.

In 2019 a celebration of 50 years of Murray&#x27;s involvement in the car industry was held, called &quot;One Formula&quot;. Every one of Murray&#x27;s F1 designs was on display along with the McLaren F1 roadcar and examples from his personal car collection, along with hundreds of rock band T-shirts that Murray had collected over the years. The book &quot;One Formula - 50 years of car design&quot; details Murray&#x27;s designs.

On 4 August 2020, Gordon Murray Automotive announced the T.50 sports car, the &quot;logical successor&quot; to the McLaren F1 and incorporating the &quot;fan car&quot; concept of the Brabham BT46B, which went into production in 2022.

On 27 January 2022, Gordon Murray Automotive announced the T.33 super car. A twin-seater, potentially &#x27;day to day&#x27; sportscar with the same engine as the T.50, but built on a new platform to be used by three other future cars.

==Other projects==
In 1981, Murray was involved in improvements for Midas Cars.
Murray independently designed the &quot;Rocket&quot;, an ultra-lightweight, open cockpit roadster powered by a 1-litre motorcycle engine, which has an appearance similar to that of a 60&#x27;s era Grand Prix car. Looking like a single-seater, it could accommodate a passenger in tandem with the driver, the second seat located beneath a removable cover. The &quot;Rocket&quot; was built by former racing driver Chris Craft at the Light Car Company.

In September 2016 it was announced that Murray had been appointed to develop the OX truck, a flat pack low-cost vehicle, for the British charity Global Vehicle Trust (GVT). GVT founded OX Delivers to utilise the design to make last-mile transport more accessible and reliable in emerging markets. Murray created four experimental prototypes; XP1-XP4. XP2, XP3, and XP4 are owned by OX Delivers, with one of the vehicles having been converted to a fully-electric truck. OX then went on to build 2 more electric trucks adapting the original design for EV use. XP1 is owned by Murray for his private collection.

From 2015, Murray collaborated with TVR to design the upcoming TVR models, with the TVR Griffith released in 2017.

==Honours==
His alma mater, Durban University of Technology, made Gordon Murray an Honorary Professor in 2002 and awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2011.
In the 2019 New Year Honours list Murray was awarded a CBE for services to motoring.
In 2022 Murray was awarded the inaugural FIA President&#x27;s Innovation Medal, &#x27;for his constant innovative approach to race and road car design&#x27;.
In 2024 Murray was awarded the BBC Top Gear Lifetime Achievement Award as &#x27;arguably the greatest and most original thinker in both Formula One and the wider automotive sphere&#x27;.

<text>Igor Aleksander (born 26 January 1937) is an emeritus professor of Neural Systems Engineering in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Imperial College London. He worked in artificial intelligence and neural networks and designed the world&#x27;s first neural pattern recognition system in the 1980s.

==Life and work==
Aleksander was educated in Italy and graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, arriving in the UK in the late 1950s, intending to become a research student under Colin Cherry. Instead he found work with Standard Telephones and Cables, later joining Queen Mary College where he gained a PhD, subsequently becoming a lecturer there in 1961. He moved to the University of Kent in 1968 as a reader in Electronics and then to Brunel University as professor in 1974. In 1984 he became professor at Imperial College London as professor of the Management of Information Technology. He was Head of Electrical Engineering and Gabor Professor of Neural Systems Engineering at Imperial College from 1988 to his retirement in 2002. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (1988), and he served as Pro-rector of External Relations at Imperial College (1997). In 2005 he presented the Bernard Price Memorial Lecture.

His work centred on the modelling capability of artificial neural networks. He devised neuromodels of the visual system in primates, visuo-verbal system in humans, the effect of anaesthetics on awareness, and artificial consciousness. He inspired the engineering design of one of the first stand alone neural pattern recognition systems, the WISARD (anonym for Wilkie Stonham Aleksander&#x27;s Recognition Device) which was named after the co-inventors Bruce Wilkie, John Stonham and Igor Aleksander. This Brunel University prototype WISARD was commercially developed and marketed by Computer Recognition Systems, Wokingham, under the trade name of ’CRS WISARD’ in 1984. After this, the further developments of this system do not appear to have been documented. A popular link for WISARD is that of “the wisard pattern recognition machine” at the Winton Gallery, British Science Museum.

Aleksander received an honorary degree in Computer Engineering from University of Palermo in July 2011.

<text>The Five Scrolls or the Five Megillot ( , &quot;Hamesh Megillot&quot; or &quot;Chomeish Megillos&quot;) are parts of the Ketuvim (&quot;Writings&quot;), the third major section of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). The Five Scrolls are the Song of Songs, the Book of Ruth, the Book of Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and the Book of Esther. These five relatively short biblical books are grouped together in Jewish tradition.
==History==
An early testimony that these five scrolls were grouped together is in the &quot;Midrash Rabba&quot;. This &quot;midrash&quot; was compiled on the Pentateuch and on the Five Scrolls.

==Liturgical use==

All five of these &quot;megillot&quot; (&quot;scrolls&quot;) are traditionally read publicly in the synagogue over the course of the year in many Jewish communities. In common printed editions of the Tanakh they appear in the order that they are read in the synagogue on holidays (beginning with Passover).

===Song of Songs===
The Song of Songs ( &quot;Shir ha-Shirim&quot;) is read publicly in some communities, especially by Ashkenazim, on the Sabbath of Passover. In most Mizrahi Jewish communities it is read publicly each week at the onset of the Shabbat (Sabbath). There is also a widespread custom to read it at the end of the Passover Seder.

In the Sephardi ritual it is read before the Mincha service on the afternoon of the seventh day of Passover (eighth day outside Israel). Italian Jews read it at the &quot;Maariv&quot; (Evening Prayer) of the first and second day of Passover.

===Ruth===
The Book of Ruth () is read in some communities, especially by Ashkenazim, before the reading of the Torah on the morning of &quot;Shavuot&quot;. Others read it in the &quot;Tikkun&quot; at night, or not at all.

===Lamentations===
The Book of Lamentations ( &quot;Eikhah&quot; or &quot;Kinnot&quot;) is read on the night of Tisha B&#x27;Av in all Jewish communities.

===Ecclesiastes===
Ecclesiastes ( &quot;Kohelet&quot;) is read publicly in some communities, especially by Ashkenazim, on the Sabbath of Sukkot. In other communities it is not read at all.

===Esther===
The Book of Esther () is read in all Jewish communities on Purim. The public reading is done twice, on the evening of Purim and once again the next morning.

===Common practice===
When read in the synagogue, these five books are sung with cantillation (see below). In most communities, Esther is the only book accompanied by blessings before and after, but certain communities adopted the custom of the Vilna Gaon to recite blessings before the other four &quot;megillot&quot; as well.

As indicated above, however, only two of the &quot;megillot&quot; are traditionally read in all Jewish communities, Esther on Purim and Lamentations on Tisha B&#x27;Av. The practice of reading the other three books on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals is widespread but by no means universal. To read them is a venerable custom among Ashkenazim, but some Sephardic Jews do not associate the three books with the three festivals.

==Cantillation==
The cantillation marks which guide the singing of the text written in the printed texts of the Five Scrolls are drawn from the same set of markings as the notes in the Humash (Pentateuch). However, the tune in which they are read varies depending on the scroll. Esther is read in a happier tune than the sad tune of Lamentations. Traditionally, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, and Song of Songs are read with the same festive tune.

==Other uses==
The term &quot;megillah&quot; is most widely used for the book of Esther, even though it is applied to the rest as well. The term &quot;megillah&quot; is also used in a joking way, in reference to any lengthy story.

Eugene H. Peterson&#x27;s &quot;Five Smooth Stones for Pastoral Work&quot; examines the application of the Megillot to Christian pastoral theology. p.21.

<text>The Elbe Sandstone Mountains, also called the Elbe Sandstone Highlands (, ; , ), are a mountain range straddling the border between the state of Saxony in southeastern Germany and the North Bohemian region of the Czech Republic, with about three-quarters of the area lying on the German side. In both countries, core parts of the mountain range have been declared a national park. The name derives from the sandstone which was carved by erosion. The river Elbe breaks through the mountain range in a steep and narrow valley.

The Saxon Switzerland and Bohemian Switzerland national parks, known also as Saxon-Bohemian Switzerland, are located within the territory of Elbe Sandstone Mountains.

==Geography==

=== Extent ===
The Elbe Sandstone Mountains extend on both sides of the Elbe from the Saxon town of Pirna in the northwest toward Bohemian Děčín in the southeast. Their highest peak with is the Děčínský Sněžník in Bohemian Switzerland on the left bank of the river in Bohemian Switzerland north of Děčín. The mountain range links the Ore Mountains in the west with the Lusatian Highlands range of the Sudetes in the east. Saxon Switzerland and the Zittau Mountains of the Lusatian Mountains form the Saxon-Bohemian Chalk Sandstone Region.

=== Terrain ===
The most striking characteristic of this deeply dissected rocky mountain range is the extraordinary variety of terrain within the smallest area. Unique amongst the Central European Uplands are the constant changes between plains, ravines, table mountains and rocky regions with undeveloped areas of forest. This diversity is ecologically significant. The variety of different locations, each with its own conditions in terms of soil and microclimate, has produced an enormous richness of species. The numbers of ferns and mosses alone is unmatched by any other of the German central uplands.

The occurrence of Elbe sandstones and hence the Elbe Sandstone Mountains themselves is related to widespread deposition by a former sea in the Upper Cretaceous epoch. On the Saxon side of the border the term &quot;Elbe Valley Cretaceous&quot; is used, referring to a region stretching from Meißen-Oberau in the northwest through Dresden and Pirna into Saxon Switzerland, and which is formed by sandstones, planers and other rocks as well as basal conglomerates of older origin. Several erosion relics from Reinhardtsgrimma through Dippoldiswalde and the Tharandt Forest to Siebenlehn form isolated examples south of Dresden. They are mainly characterised by sandstones.
On the Bohemian side the sandstone beds continue and form part of the North Bohemian Cretaceous. The chalk sediments of the Zittau Basin are counted as part of the latter due to their regional-geological relationships. The sedimentary sequences of the Cretaceous sea continue across a wide area of the Czech Republic to Moravia. Together these beds form the Saxon-Bohemian Cretaceous Zone. In Czech geological circles, the Elbe Valley Cretaceous is described as the foothills of the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin.

=== Geology ===
The eroded sandstone landscape of this region was formed from depositions that accumulated on the bottom of the sea millions of years ago. Large rivers carried sand and other eroded debris into the Cretaceous sea. Rough quartz sand, clay and fine marl sank and became lithified layer by layer. A compact sandstone sequence developed, about 20 x 30 kilometres wide and up to 600 metres thick dating to the lower Cenomanian to Santonian stages. The tremendous variety of shapes in the sandstone landscape is a result of the subsequent chemical and physical erosion and biological processes acting on the rocks formed from those sands laid down during the Cretaceous Period.

The inlets of a Cretaceous sea, together with marine currents, carried away sand over a very long period of time into a shallow zone of the sea and then the diagenetic processes at differing pressure regimes resulted in the formation of sandstone beds. Its stratification is characterized by variations in the horizontal structure (deposits of clay minerals, grain sizes of quartz, differences in the grain-cement) as well as a typical but fairly small fossil presence and variably porous strata.

After the Cretaceous sea had retreated (marine regression), the surface of the land was shaped by weathering influences and watercourses, of which the Elbe made the deepest incision. Later the Lusatian granodiorite was uplifted over the 600 metre thick sandstone slab along the Lusatian Fault and pushed it downwards until it fractured. This northern boundary of the sandstone deposit lies roughly along the line Pillnitz–Hohnstein–Hinterhermsdorf–Krásná Lípa.
In the Tertiary period, the adjacent region of the Central Bohemian Uplands and the Lusatian Mountains was shaped and affected by intense volcanism; but individual intrusions of magma also forced their way through the sandstone platform of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. The most striking evidence of this phase in the earth&#x27;s history are the conical basaltic hills of Růžovský vrch, Cottaer Spitzberg and Raumberg, but also Großer and Kleiner Winterberg.

At its southwestern edge the sandstone plate was uplifted by over 200 metres at the Karsdorf Fault, whereby the slab was tilted even more and increased the gradient of the Elbe River. The water masses cut valleys into the rock with their streambeds and contributed in places to the formation of the rock faces. Over time the gradients reduced, the streambed of the Elbe widened out and changed its course time and again, partly as a result of the climatic influences of the ice ages.

The mineral composition of the sandstone beds has a direct effect on the morphology of the terrain. The fine-grained form with clayey-silty cement between the quartz grains causes banks and slopes with terracing. The beds of sandstone with siliceous cement are typically the basis of the formation of rock faces and crags. Small variations in the cement composition of the rock can have a visible impact on the landscape.

Elbe Sandstone gets its characteristic cuboid appearance from 
its thick horizontal strata (massive bedding) and its vertical fissures. In 1839 Bernhard Cotta wrote about this in his comments on the &quot;geognostic map&quot;: &quot;Vertical fissures and cracks cut through, often virtually at right angles, the horizontal layers and, as a result, parallelepiped bodies are formed, that have given rise to the description Quader Sandstone.&quot;. &quot;Quader&quot; is German for an ashlar or block of stone, hence the name &quot;Square Sandstone&quot; is also used in English.

The term Quader Sandstone Mountains or Square Sandstone Mountains, introduced by Hanns Bruno Geinitz in 1849, is an historical, geological term for similar sandstone deposits, but was also used in connection with the Elbe Sandstone Mountains.
The fissures were formed as a result of long-term tectonic stresses on the entire sandstone platform of the mountain range. This network of clefts runs through the sandstone beds in a relatively regular way, but in different directions in two regions of the range. Subsequent weathering processes of very different forms and simultaneous complex deposition (leaching, frost and salt wedging, wind, solution weathering with sintering as well as biogenic and microbial effects) have further changed the nature of the rock surface. For example, collapse caves, small hole-like cavities (honeycomb weathering) with hourglass-shaped pillars, chimneys, crevices and mighty, rugged rock faces.

Many morphological formations in the rocky landscape of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are suspected to have been formed as a consequence of karstification. Important indicators of such processes in the polygenetic and polymorphic erosion landscape of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are the furrows with parallel ridges between them (grykes and clints) that look like cart ruts and which are particularly common, as well as extensive cave systems. They are occasionally described by the term pseudokarst. The application of the concept to several erosion formations in the sandstone of this mountain range is however contentious. Czech geologists have identified in quartzite-cemented sandstone areas in the northern part of the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin, karst features in the shape of spherical caverns and cave formations. According to them, these emerged as a result of solution processes by water in complex interactions with iron compounds from neighbouring or intrusive magmatic-volcanic rocks. The variation in relief in these sandstone regions is explained on the basis of these processes. The Elbe Sandstone Mountains are the greatest cretaceous sandstone erosion complex in Europe.

Human-induced changes caused by nearly 1,000 years of continual sandstone quarrying have also contributed in parts of the sandstone highlands to the appearance of the landscape today. The fissures (called &quot;Loose&quot; by the quarrymen) played an important role here, because they provided in effect natural divisions in the rock that were helpful when demolishing a rock face or when dressing the rough blocks of stone.

The sandstone of this region is a sought-after building material used for example, for imposing city edifices such as the Church of Our Lady in Dresden.

== Conservation ==
Large parts of the Elbe Sandstone Mountains are under statutory protection. In Germany there is the national park region of Saxon Switzerland, which consists two elements: Saxon Switzerland National Park itself, founded in 1990 and covered an area of 93 km²; and the protected area surrounding it that was founded in 1956 and covers 287 km². The German part of the range was also designated in May 2006 as one of the 77 most important national geotopes in Germany by the Academy of Geosciences in Hanover.

In the Bohemian part of the range there has been a protected landscape area in the northeastern region since 1972 called the Elbe Sandstone Protected Landscape Area with an area of 324 km2. In 2000, Bohemian Switzerland National Park was established with an area of 79 km2, bringing around 700 km2 of the range under protection as a natural and cultural landscape.

== Tourism ==
The Elbe Sandstone mountains have been a popular destination for tourists for more than 200 years, and for climbers for more than 100 years. It is also a popular recreation area for the nearby Saxon capital Dresden. Places of interest include the Bastei cliffs near Rathen, the Königstein Fortress, Pravčická brána, the Schrammsteine, Pfaffenstein, and the valleys of the Kirnitzsch and Kamenice rivers.
There are some 14,000 climbing routes via which mountain climbers can conquer 1100 free-standing peaks. Visitors can experience the natural scenes on the asphalt Elbe cycle path, or on board a steam paddleboat that is part of the oldest fleet of its kind in the world.

The Elbe Sandstone Mountains have numerous facilities for cure and rehabilitation. The discovery of ferrous and sulphurous sources in Bad Schandau in 1730 led to its development as a health resort and the building of swimming baths.

<text>Balaklava (Ukrainian and , , ) is a settlement on the Crimean Peninsula and part of the city of Sevastopol. It is an administrative center of Balaklavsky District that used to be part of the Crimean Oblast before it was transferred to Sevastopol Municipality. Population: 

==History==

Balaklava has changed possession several times during its history. A settlement at its present location was founded under the name of Symbolon () by the Ancient Greeks, for whom it was an important commercial city.

During the Middle Ages, it was controlled by the Byzantine Empire and then by the Genoese who conquered it in 1365. The Byzantines called the town Yamboli and the Genoese named it Cembalo. The Genoese built a large trading empire in both the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, buying slaves in Eastern Europe and shipping them to Egypt via the Crimea, a lucrative market hotly contested with by the Venetians.

The ruins of a Genoese fortress positioned high on a clifftop above the entrance to the Balaklava Inlet are a popular tourist attraction and have recently become the stage for a medieval festival. The fortress is a subject of Mickiewicz&#x27;s penultimate poem in his 1826 cycle of &quot;Crimean Sonnets&quot;.

In 1475, Cembalo City was conquered by the Turks and was subsequently renamed &quot;Balyk-Yuva&quot; (Fish&#x27;s Nest) which then became Balaklava.

During the Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774, the Russian troops invaded Crimea in 1771. Thirteen years later, Crimea was definitively annexed by the Russian Empire. After that, the Crimean Tatar and Turkish population was forcefully replaced by Greek Orthodox people from the Archipelago.
The town became famous for the Battle of Balaclava during the Crimean War thanks to the suicidal Charge of the Light Brigade, a British cavalry charge due to a misunderstanding sent up a valley strongly held on three sides by the Russians, in which about 250 men were killed or wounded, and over 400 horses lost, effectively reducing the size of the mounted brigade by two thirds and destroying some of the finest light cavalry in the world to no military purpose. Alfred, Lord Tennyson immortalized the battle in verse in his &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;.

The balaclava, a tight knitted garment covering the whole head and neck with holes for the eyes and mouth, also takes its name from this settlement, where soldiers first wore them. Also numerous towns founded in English-speaking countries in later parts of the 19th Century were named &quot;Balaklava&quot; (see Balaklava (disambiguation)).

In 1954, Balaklava, together with the whole of Crimea, was transferred from the Russian FSFR to the Ukrainian SSR. In 1957 it was formally incorporated into the municipal borders of Sevastopol by the Soviet government and lost city status. Upon the break-up of the USSR, the town, along with the entire Crimean peninsula, became constituent parts of the modern state of Ukraine. There are dozens of monuments in the town dedicated to the remembrance of military valor in past wars, including the Great Patriotic War, the Crimean War and the Russian Civil War.

Since the internationally unrecognized 2014 annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Balaklava, along with rest of Crimea, is administered by Russia. In 2019 Russian authorities granted Balaklava status of a city within Sevastopol.

==Underground submarine base==

One of the monuments is an underground, formerly classified submarine base that was operational until 1993. The base was said to be virtually indestructible and designed to survive a direct atomic impact. During that period, Balaklava was one of the most secret residential areas in the Soviet Union. Almost the entire population of Balaklava at one time worked at the base; even family members could not visit the town of Balaklava without a good reason and proper identification. The base remained operational after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 until 1993 when the decommissioning process started. This process saw the removal of the warheads and low-yield torpedoes. In 1996, the last Russian submarine left the base. The base has since been opened to the public as the Naval museum complex Balaklava.

<text>In cryptography, RC2 (also known as ARC2) is a symmetric-key block cipher designed by Ron Rivest in 1987. &quot;RC&quot; stands for &quot;Ron&#x27;s Code&quot; or &quot;Rivest Cipher&quot;; other ciphers designed by Rivest include RC4, RC5, and RC6.

The development of RC2 was sponsored by Lotus, who were seeking a custom cipher that, after evaluation by the NSA, could be exported as part of their Lotus Notes software. The NSA suggested a few changes, which Rivest incorporated. After further negotiations, the cipher was approved for export in 1989. Along with RC4, RC2 with a 40-bit key size was treated favourably under US export regulations for cryptography.

Initially, the details of the algorithm were kept secret — proprietary to RSA Security — but on 29 January 1996, source code for RC2 was anonymously posted to the Internet on the Usenet forum sci.crypt. Mentions of CodeView and SoftICE (popular debuggers) suggest that it had been reverse engineered. A similar disclosure had occurred earlier with RC4.

In March 1998, Ron Rivest authored an RFC publicly describing RC2 himself.

RC2 is a 64-bit block cipher with a variable size key. Its 18 rounds are arranged as a source-heavy unbalanced Feistel network, with 16 rounds of one type (&quot;MIXING&quot;) punctuated by two rounds of another type (&quot;MASHING&quot;). A MIXING round consists of four applications of the MIX transformation, as shown in the diagram.

RC2 is vulnerable to a related-key attack using 234 chosen plaintexts.

<text>McLeod&#x27;s Daughters is an Australian drama television series created by Posie Graeme-Evans and Caroline Stanton for the Nine Network, which aired from 8 August 2001, to 31 January 2009, lasting eight seasons. It stars Lisa Chappell and Bridie Carter in the leading roles as two sisters reunited after twenty years of separation, thrust into a working relationship when they inherit their family&#x27;s cattle station in South Australia. The series is produced by Millennium Television, in association with Nine Films and Television and Southern Star. Graeme-Evans, Kris Noble and Susan Bower served as the original executive producers.

The series was originally conceived as a then-intended television film pilot, which broadcast on Nine Network in 1996. Despite its success, and becoming the highest-rated telemovie in Australian television history, a series was not picked up by the network until several years later.

The majority of filming took place on location in Kingsford, a locality in South Australia. An instant success, &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; enjoyed critical acclaim, ultimately reaching the number one drama spot during its fourth and fifth season. The series was nominated for a number of awards, including 41 Logie Awards, winning eight in total, notably for Most Popular Actress, Most Popular Actor, Most Popular Australian Program, and Most Popular Australian Drama Series. It has also achieved acclaim around the world, having developed a devoted fan base in the United States, Canada, Ireland, several European countries, and is moderately successful in the United Kingdom.

==Premise==
Following the death of Jack McLeod, his daughter, Claire, has inherited Drover&#x27;s Run, a substantial cattle station, situated in South Australia. While trying to keep her home and business moving forward, the future of the property is suddenly placed in jeopardy when her estranged half-sister, Tess, whom Claire has not seen for 20 years, arrives and announces that she has inherited half the land and intends to sell her share. Unable to buy her out, Claire attempts to convince Tess of the consequences of selling and how it could possibly affect the property. Claire is forced to get rid of her current employees due to a deceitful discovery, until Tess agrees to remain on Drover&#x27;s Run for the time being to help her sister, despite her inexperience. Together, with help of housekeeper, Meg, her daughter, Jodi, and local girl, Becky, the women create an all-female workforce.

==Production==
===Development===
Posie Graeme-Evans developed the idea for &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; in the early 1990s for her company Millenium Pictures in conjunction with the South Australian Film Corporation. She also developed the idea for children&#x27;s television programs such as &quot;The Miraculous Mellops&quot; and &quot;Hi-5&quot;. The idea was for a television drama set on an Australian rural property with two half-sisters running the property inherited from their father with an all-female workforce. She developed the idea from stories from friends who grew up in the country and from the love of South Australian landscapes as shown in the paintings of Hans Heysen.

Graeme-Evans pitched the idea to the board of the Nine Network, who agreed to film a telemovie in March 1996 with Jack Thompson starring as the father Jack McLeod, whose death leads to the two half-sisters (portrayed by Kym Wilson as Tess and Tammy MacIntosh as Claire) inheriting the property. The character of Jack McLeod did not appear in the series, so Claire is now running Drovers Run, with the help of her father&#x27;s farmhands, following her father&#x27;s death from a heart attack.

Following the success of the telemovie shown on Mother&#x27;s Day 1996, the Nine Network board agreed to commission a 22-episode series, but the project was left on the shelf for four years. It was finally revived in late 2000 after the opening ceremony for the 2000 Sydney Olympics featured a &quot;The Man from Snowy River&quot; theme, which highlighted the cultural significance of the bush to Australians.

===Casting===
Lisa Chappell, a successful New Zealand actress, known for her role in the soap opera &quot;Gloss&quot;, was cast as Claire McLeod. The role of Claire was initially intended to go to actress Laurie Foell, for which was on hold for four months prior to the beginning of production, when Chappell, who was, at the time, in the process of setting up a theatre company, was invited to audition and received the part. Chappell was known to Australian audiences, appearing in seven episodes of &quot;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys&quot;. She is popular in New Zealand for her musical work, and has also appeared in the TV series &quot;The Stingers&quot; and &quot;The Cult&quot;. During the production of the series, she learned how to ride a horse and shear sheep.

Bridie Carter, a NIDA graduate, was virtually unknown to audiences, having only appeared in few guest roles in drama series which included &quot;Home and Away&quot;, &quot;Water Rats&quot; and &quot;All Saints&quot;. However, &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; marks her first major screen role. Both Carter and Chappell were chosen from a number of high-profile actors in what was described as an &quot;exhaustive casting process&quot;.

Jessica Napier was cast in the supporting role of Becky Howard, a promiscuous young woman from a broken family, who is raped and finds refuge on Drover’s Run. Napier was recognised by executive producer Kris Noble while she was working on &quot;Wildside&quot; and considered her for a part on the series, for which Posie Graeme-Evans agreed. She admitted that the reason she accepted the part was because of Graeme-Evans. In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald, she commented that &quot;Being as passionate and in love with it as she [Graeme-Evans] has made it feel like a worthwhile project. I felt it was a project that was loved and one they would go all out to make work.&quot; Napier was a Sydney-based actor at the time and relocated to Adelaide for the part.

=== Locations ===
&quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; is filmed on location at Kingsford, a 135-acre (55 ha) property which is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register and is located in the locality of Kingsford, north of Gawler. which Posie Graeme-Evans refers to as &quot;our very own backlot&quot;. Kingsford was originally part of a 30,000-acre (12,245ha) property. The historical house was built from Edinburgh sandstone, transported to Australia as a ship ballast. The house took over 30 years to build and was finished by 1856.

Kingsford had been used in the years prior to filming by the South Australian Government as a wheat research station then by a Montessori school as a primary school campus. The working property was purchased by The Nine Network in 1999. Although Kingsford was a grand property in its time, it is now quite run down - a look that was important for the production design of the series, as the McLeod family has no money for maintenance.

The interior scenes set at Drover’s Run are all filmed inside the house. It not only added authenticity to the production, but the large rooms and high ceilings were ideal for filming.

==== Locations in Gungellan ====
Mostly fictional settings:
* Drover’s Run – the main setting for the show. Drover’s Run has been in the McLeod family for years, passed down to father, son, and now daughters. Claire McLeod, Tess McLeod, and Jodi McLeod all have run Drovers Run along with part owners Stevie Ryan, Regan McLeod and Grace McLeod.
* Killarney – also known as the Ryan Empire. At the start of the series Harry Ryan owned the property, and as he grew older his sons Alex and Nick took over. After Nick and Tess married, they left to run a ranch in Argentina. Alex ran Killarney for a couple of years, until his biological father (Bryce) became part owner of the property. On Bryce&#x27;s death, half-brother Marcus became part owner of the property. In the final years of the show both Alex and Marcus own and run Killarney, although Alex became a largely absentee owner as he also began to spend much of his time on the ranch in Argentina.
* Kinsellas – a local farm that was run by Sandra Kinsella from 2003–2006. The name was changed after Heath Barret bought it.
*The Local Pub – (Gungellan Hotel) where everyone goes for a drink after a hard day&#x27;s labour. Becky worked there in 2001, Jodi worked there briefly in 2005 and Tayler also worked there briefly in 2007. It is most likely the only pub in Gungellan.
* The Truck Stop – where most of the town buys their supplies and when they need fuel. It was first owned by Ken Logan, then his daughter Jennifer followed by Harry Ryan. When Harry was owner Terry Dodge managed it then Moira Doyle. Later on Moira and Regan McLeod went into business supplying the fuel, Phill Rakich was the last owner.
* The Town Hall – where most major events are held, such as the Miss Gungellan contest, plays, and the town&#x27;s birthday celebration.
* Fisher – Gungellan&#x27;s closest neighbouring town.

=== Filming ===
The show was shot on Super 16 mm film, and is the first Australian drama series to be delivered in HDTV format. Three cameras were used, two on main unit and the third on second unit. Director of photography, Roger Dowling created the illusion that the series is shot on a 50,000 hectare property in the Australian bush, instead of on a heritage estate about the size of a hobby farm.

===Main cast changes===
The first three seasons follow the lives of half-sisters Claire McLeod and Tess Silverman McLeod, farmhands Jodi Fountain and Becky Howard, Jodi&#x27;s mother and Drovers Run housekeeper Meg Fountain, and their affluent neighbours, the Ryan family.

The cast remained the same until the third season, when it was announced that Jessica Napier would be leaving. Her character, Becky Howard, initially decided to take a job at another farm with her boyfriend Jake, but then changed her mind and went back to school on the Agricultural Scholarship she had won during the young farmers competition. News of a second major cast change hit when it was announced that Lisa Chappell, who played Claire McLeod, would be leaving the series. Claire, Tess, and baby Charlotte were involved in a car accident, with Tess and Charlotte making it to safety before their vehicle slid over a cliff, killing Claire. Simmone Jade Mackinnon&#x27;s character, Stevie Hall, was introduced to replace Chappell.

Season four began with the promotion of Brett Tucker to series regular. A new farm-hand, Kate Manfredi, was introduced in the fourteenth episode of season four. The introduction of Kate was to accommodate the departure of Meg, who left to pursue a writing job in Melbourne. She remained credited as a main character until the end of season 5.

When the show began to decrease in ratings in the fifth season, producers decided to introduce several new characters to try and liven up the show. They brought in the no-nonsense, secretive Rob Shelton who was employed as the overseer at Killarney; the geologist cousin of Tess and Jodi, Regan McLeod; and the troubled brother of Dave, Patrick Brewer. Even with these cast changes, the show suffered another major blow when Myles Pollard announced that he was leaving the show to pursue other opportunities in the USA. His character, Nick Ryan was supposedly killed in a plane crash.

Ratings started to rise in the sixth season, when it took on a more soap opera-type style, while staying true to the original premise of the show. This was the last season before the show began its downhill slope. After four seasons, recurring character Moria Doyle (played by Doris Younane) was promoted to series regular to replace Meg Fountain. Pollard returned briefly when it was revealed that Nick had not died in a plane crash, but had actually been unconscious in a hospital in Argentina. Bridie Carter also decided to leave the show, departing with Pollard when their characters returned to Argentina. This saw the return and promotion to the main cast of Regan McLeod. Another blow was dealt when Jonny Pasvolsky decided to quit. His character, Rob Shelton/Matt Bosnich, had to leave Gungellan when he was found by the hitmen who had been pursuing him. The return of Zoe Naylor&#x27;s character, Regan McLeod was to accommodate the departure of Tess, however this had no impact. The ratings started to slip and two more characters were introduced: the replacement overseer for Killarney, Riley Ward, and the immature Tayler Geddes, whose father died in an explosion at a mine where Regan worked. The final episode saw Brett Tucker&#x27;s character Dave Brewer depart the series to work as a vet in Africa and the temporary departure of Michala Banas&#x27;s character, Kate Manfredi.

The seventh season saw the introduction of Marcus Turner, who was employed as an account manager by Bryce Redstaff, Alex&#x27;s biological father. It was later revealed that Marcus was Alex&#x27;s half-brother. The seventh season also saw the return of Matt Bosnich, who was free to continue his life outside of witness protection. The news, however, that Rachael Carpani was departing the show and her character Jodi McLeod, along with Matt, would be written out was soon announced and Matt and Jodi were &quot;killed&quot; in a car explosion. It later turned out that they were alive, but used a car explosion to cover up this fact so they could go into witness protection. To compensate for Carpani&#x27;s departure, Abi Tucker&#x27;s character Grace Kingston McLeod was introduced as the feisty sister of Regan and cousin of Jodi. Michala Banas&#x27;s character Kate was written back in as was Sonia Todd&#x27;s character Meg Fountain, however the latter departed soon after. It was announced that not only would Zoe Naylor be leaving, but so would the last remaining original cast member, Aaron Jeffery, though they would both return. Regan left to run a mine, while Alex left to help Nick and Tess in Argentina. A new vet, Ingrid Marr, was introduced to stir up trouble between Grace and Marcus. Dustin Clare&#x27;s character Riley Ward was killed in a car accident at the end of season seven.

The departure of Michala Banas rocked the crew of &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; and her character was written out to work on a farm for at-risk youth. Aaron Jeffery returned for one episode in season eight, where his character Alex Ryan was killed when a large tree branch fell on him. Regan returned for the christening of baby Xander, who was born the day after Alex died. Stevie&#x27;s fun-loving cousin Ben Hall was introduced as the new overseer of Killarney, replacing Riley, while the vivacious sister of Regan and Grace, Jaz McLeod returned to Drovers Run after making a guest appearance in season four. The series finale saw Sonia Todd and Rachael Carpani return as Meg Fountain and Jodi McLeod respectively.

The first episode of &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; eventually debuted in August 2001 and proved to be a hit, attracting 1.89 million viewers. The first season was a success, attracting an average of 1.5 million viewers per episode in Australia. The show aired in New Zealand on TV2, one of TVNZ&#x27;s free-to-air channels. The final season on TV2 began airing a month after Australia and eventually became 10 episodes in front of Australia until the finale. Reruns from season one are currently on Vibe in New Zealand, a channel aimed at women&#x27;s programming.

The second season of &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; was equally successful, being the third-most popular drama on Australian television. By 2003, the show was the most popular drama series on Australian television. Its popularity in Australia was highlighted when the show won four Logie Awards, including Lisa Chappell winning most popular female actor and Aaron Jeffery winning most popular actor, with the show itself winning most popular Australian drama series in 2004 and 2005.

The show then began to decline in popularity and perceived quality. Cast turnover was high, and increasingly far-fetched stories were used to explain the sudden departure of formerly important characters, such as Rachael Carpani, who departed in 2007 and Aaron Jeffery, who left in 2008. In 2007, many viewers considered the show to have &quot;jumped the shark&quot;, as the show had drifted into a new direction, that of a soap opera; at that point, the show began to experience low ratings. Jeffery commented to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that his desire to depart from the show was due to the new direction the show was taking, which he did not like.

The 200th episode of &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; aired on 3 October 2007, with Hugh McLeod (Grace, Jasmine, and Regan&#x27;s father) returning for this special event. An entirely different script was originally written when one of the original cast (speculated to be Bridie Carter) agreed to come back, but it was pulled at the last minute. Ratings for this episode were very poor by Australian standards, with only 1,008,000 viewers tuning in; the highest that season was 1,415,000 for episode 16.

The eighth and final season began on 23 July 2008 with the episode 203, &quot;Aftermath&quot;, but after two further episodes, Channel 9 pulled the show from its schedule due to extremely low ratings. The remaining episodes were eventually aired from December to January in a double-episode format, with the final two episodes (&quot;Into the Valley of the Shadow&quot; and &quot;The Long Paddock&quot;) airing on 31 January 2009 with original cast members returning for the special event.

In May 2020, &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; was voted the number one show during the &quot;Great Australian Binge&quot;.

==International broadcast==
Following its instant success in Australia, &quot;Mcleod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; was sold to over 100 countries, most notably, the US-based Hallmark Channel, which was available in several international countries, including Australia, Asia, and European countries, with time and broadcast dates varying. The series premiered in the UK on the Hallmark Channel in Autumn 2001, originally in a weekend primetime slot. Due to its growing success, Hallmark secured the rights to the third season in 2002 and the fourth season in 2003, which were then scheduled for 26 and 30 episodes, respectively, before being extended. The third season eventually screened from 28 August 2003 on the network, while season four commenced in 2004. During the later years of the series, it was moved from its primetime slot to an 11 am morning slot. The final season began airing in the UK Hallmark on 12 October 2008 with double episodes every Sunday morning from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. The final two episode aired in the UK on Sunday 21 December 2008, a month before the episodes aired in Australia.

In Germany the final two episodes aired on 4 November 2008 in a German-dubbed-version, a month before airing in the UK in the original language. In Ireland, RTÉ Two began airing the final season in mid-2010 in a late-night time slot, with the final episode airing early 2011. This was the first time season 8 had been shown on the channel, as RTÉ had long period gaps between each season. In early 2011, the channel began airing the series from the beginning, but was stopped less than halfway through the first season. In the US, the series debuted on 2 October 2004 on the WE tv (Women&#x27;s Entertainment) cable channel, and ran for several seasons.

Three albums, selected from the music from the series, were released in 2002, 2004, and 2008.

===Streaming===
In Australia, the complete series is available to stream on 9Now, and Stan. In New Zealand, it is available via TVNZ+. Netflix made all 8 seasons available to US subscribers in 2009. The series was available to stream in the UK via Amazon Prime Video&#x27;s main subscription service before moving to Amazon Freevee, a free ad-based service from Amazon. It can also be streamed on the UK&#x27;s STV Player. It is available in multiple countries on Pluto TV, where it features a &quot;McLeod&#x27;s Daughters&quot; channel and the entire series on demand.

==Potential reboot==
On 6 July 2017, the Nine Network confirmed that they were in talks with Posie Graeme-Evans about a potential reboot of the series. On 6 September 2017, Posie Graeme-Evans announced, &quot;We have a story now, and I think it&#x27;s a cracker. Just finishing the work we need to do before I talk about the next steps with the network.&quot; On 23 October 2017, Posie Graeme-Evans announced she had ended negotiations with Nine as creative differences for a new series remained, but has not ruled out potentially crowd-funding her project.

<text>Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux (24 August 1753 – 24 March 1824) was a deputy to the National Convention during the French Revolution. He later served as a prominent leader of the French Directory.

==Life==
He was born at Montaigu (Vendée), the son of J. B. de la Révellière. He adopted the name Lépeaux from a small property belonging to his family, and he was known locally as M. de Lépeaux. He studied law at Angers and Paris, being called to the bar in 1775. A deputy to the Estates-General of 1789, he returned at the close of the session to Angers, where with his school-friends J. B. Leclerc and Urbain-René Pilastre he sat on the council of Maine-et-Loire, and had to deal with the first Vendéen outbreaks. In 1792 he was returned by the &quot;département&quot; to the Convention, and on 19 November he proposed the famous decree by which France offered protection to foreign nations in their struggle for liberty.

Although La Révellière-Lépeaux voted for the death of Louis XVI, he was not in general agreement with the extremists. He was proscribed with the Girondins in 1793, and remained in hiding until the revolt of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794). After serving on the commission to prepare the initiation of the new constitution he became in July 1795 president of the Assembly, and shortly afterwards a member of the Committee of Public Safety. His name stood first on the list of directors elected, and he became president of the Directory.

Of his colleagues he was in alliance with Jean-François Rewbell and to a lesser degree with Barras, but the greatest of his fellow-directors, Lazare Carnot, was the object of his undying hatred. His policy was marked by a bitter hostility to the Christian religion, which he proposed to supplant as a civilizing agent by theophilanthropy, a new religion invented by the English deist David Williams. The credit of the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797), by which the allied directors made themselves supreme, La Révellière-Lépeaux arrogated to himself in his &quot;Mémoires&quot;, which in this as in other matters must be read with caution.

Compelled to resign by the Coup of 30 Prairial Year VII (18 June 1799), he lived in retirement in the country, and took no further part in public affairs even after his return to Paris ten years later.

<doc id="632609" wikidata="Q7358152" url="?curid=632609" title="Roger Elliott (governor)">
<text>Major General Roger Elliott ( 1665 – 16 May 1714
was one of the earliest British Governors of Gibraltar. A member of the Eliot family, his son Granville Elliott became the first Count Elliott and his nephew George Augustus Eliott also became a noted Governor and defender of Gibraltar.

==Early life==
Roger Elliott was born, possibly in London but more probably in the English Colony of Tangier in Morocco, to George Elliott ( 1636 - 1668, the Chirurgeon to the Tangier Garrison) and his wife Catherine (née Maxwell, 1638 – 1709). George Elliott was the illegitimate son of Richard Eliot, the wayward second son of Sir John Eliot (1592–1632).

Roger Elliott&#x27;s father, George Elliott, died at Tangier in 1668, and his widowed mother remarried there on 22 February 1670 to Robert Spotswood (17 September 1637 – 1680), the assistant and replacement Chirurgeon at the Garrison, and thirdly the Rev. Dr George Mercer, the Garrison schoolmaster. Roger Elliott was therefore an older half-brother of Alexander Spotswood ( 1676 – 6 June 1740), who became a noted Lieutenant-Governor of Virginia.

==Military career==
By 1680, Roger was an Ensign in the Tangier Regiment of Foot, and was wounded on 27 October fighting the local Moors. In 1681, he was suspended by Colonel Percy Kirke for duelling with Ensign Bartholomew Pitts, later being cashiered for this offence. He was sent back to England in 1682 with a letter begging for his readmission into His Majesty&#x27;s Service, and he was reinstated as an Ensign in his old Company on 8 March 1683. In 1684 he returned to England. In 1685, the Tangier Regiment was renamed the Queen Dowager&#x27;s Regiment of Foot, and he probably fought against the Monmouth Rebellion.

In 1687, he became a first lieutenant in the Earl of Bath&#x27;s Regiment - created by Sir John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701). He was promoted to captain on 1 May 1690. He fought and was wounded at the Battle of Steenkerque on 3 August 1692. On 21 December of that year, he was promoted to major in the same Regiment, and, on 1 January 1696, promoted to lieutenant-colonel of Sir Bevil Granville&#x27;s Regiment of Foot. In 1702, on campaign with the Duke of Marlborough, he was shot through the body at the defence of Tongeren in Belgium. He reputedly took on the entire French Army with only two regiments, before surrendering.

On 5 March 1704, he raised his own regiment – Colonel Elliott&#x27;s Regiment of Foot. Officers were commissioned on 10 April that year at St James&#x27;. On 2 July 1704, again on campaign with the Duke of Marlborough, he fought and was wounded at the Battle of Schellenberg. It is possible that he fought at the Battle of Blenheim on 13 August 1704. However, he certainly did not lead the cavalry at this battle, as has been maintained by other biographies – this was led by General Sir John &#x27;Salamander&#x27; Cutts.

==Gibraltar==
In March 1705, Colonel Elliott&#x27;s Regiment of Foot embarked for Spain and served at Gibraltar, which was declared a free port in 1706. On 1 January 1707, he was promoted to Brigadier-General, and later that year to Lieutenant-Governor of Gibraltar. On 24 December, he was appointed Governor of Gibraltar. His time in office is remembered in the Gibraltar records as one of mercenary opportunity; whereas, in the London records, it appears that he proceeded with expensive but vital defensive fortification with only minimal prior financial approval. The arguments over the accounts for these defences subsequently caused problems for the probate of his personal estate. On 1 January 1710, he was promoted to Major-General, and on 24 January 1711, he handed over the Governorship to Brigadier-General Thomas Stanwix. He finally departed Gibraltar on 18 June 1711.

==Return to England==
Elliott returned to England and leased Byfeld House in Church Road, Barnes, Surrey. He married, and had a small family. However, he never fully recovered from his wounds and died relatively early.

==Family==
On 4 March 1712 at St Peter upon Cornhill, London, Roger married Charlotte Elliot (1692 - 1753), the daughter of William &#x27;the Laceman&#x27; Elliot (1690 - 1728) of Brugh and Wells, a rich London merchant, and his wife Eleanor Tankard (1664–1745). They had two children:
#Granville Elliott (7 October 1713 – 10 October 1759), 1st Count Elliott, who married firstly Jeanne Thérèse du Han (1707–48) and secondly Elizabeth Duckett (1724–1804).
#Catherine (Kitty) Elliott (18 September 1714 – 15 January 1757), who married firstly 7 or 9 August 1736 Westminster to Charles Boyle (of Araglin Bridge, co Cork, related to the Earls of Cork and Orrery), and secondly, in 1742, to the Very Rev Robert Bligh ( 1704 - 1778), the Dean of Elphin and a younger brother of John Bligh, 1st Earl of Darnley (1687 - 1728)

Mary Elliott, who married Garrett Fitzmaurice in Ireland, claimed to be a natural daughter of Roger Elliott.

Roger Elliott never fully recovered from his various wounds and died at Byfeld House on 16 May 1714. He was buried 21 May in the cemetery of St Mary the Virgin, Barnes.

His will was probated on 16 November 1714 but his estate took longer to resolve because of the difficulties previously mentioned. The eventual resolution was mostly due to the involvement of his father-in-law, William &#x27;the Laceman&#x27; Elliot, who sought to expedite his daughter&#x27;s remarriage to Captain Thomas Burroughs.

His widow remarried on 15 July 1715 at St James, Westminster to Captain Thomas Burroughs (died before 1728). She died before 1753.

<text>Kamathipura (also spelled Kamthipura) is a neighbourhood in Mumbai, India known for prostitution. It was first settled after 1795 with the construction of causeways that connected the erstwhile seven islands of Mumbai. Initially known as Lal Bazaar, it got its name from the &quot;Kamathis&quot; (workers) of other areas of the country, who were labourers on sexual sites. Due to tough police crackdowns, in the late 1990s with the rise of AIDS and government&#x27;s redevelopment policy that helped sex workers to move out of the profession and subsequently out of Kamathipura, the number of sex workers in the area has dwindled. Since then, Kamathipura has experience gentrification, and as of 2017 Kamathipura had less than 2000 sex workers. Real estate expansion has pushed the brothels into only two of the 14 lanes across which they were once spread. As of 2022, around 1700 sex workers lived in Kmathipura. In 1992, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) recorded there were 45,000 sex workers here which was reduced to 1,600 in 2009 and 500 in 2018. Many sex workers have migrated to other areas in Maharashtra with real estate developers taking over the high-priced real estate. In 2018 the Maharashtra government sought tenders to demolish and redevelop the area.

==History==

The British fortified Mumbai as commerce of the Bombay port flourished. In 1782, the British began the project to unify the islands. Before the completion of the Hornby Vellard project in 1784, which built a causeway uniting all seven islands of Mumbai under William Hornby, governor of Bombay (1771–1784), plugged the Great Breach in Mahalaxmi, while the subsequent Bellasis Road causeway joined Mazagaon and Malabar Hill in 1793. This resulted in several low-lying marshy areas of Mumbai Flats like Byculla, Tardeo, Mahalaxmi and Kamathipura opening up for habitation. Kamathipura emerged in 1995 on the northern periphery of the Fort. Thereafter starting 1795, &quot;Kamathis&quot; (workers) of other areas of the country, working as labourers on construction sites began settling here in the flat areas which were rendered liveable due to the construction of the Hornby Vellard and the Bellasis Road, giving the area its present name. It was bounded by Bellasis Road on the north, by Gaodevi on the south and the main road across, Falkland Road. At one point during this period it was home to a Chinese community, which worked as dockhands and ran restaurants. By the late 19th century it all changed.

Till then, as previous 1864 Census figures for Mumbai indicate, other areas had a larger population of prostitutes, like Girgaon (1,044), Phanaswadi (1,323) and Oomburkharee (1,583) compared with Kamathipura (601), all which declined after 1864. In the nineteenth century the area developed in the main red light district of the city of Mumbai. In the words of a visiting missionary, &quot;...the ground floor open to the road, like native shops. In these lower as well as in the upper rooms were native women calling to the male passers-by of various nationalities.&quot; Kamathipura became established as one of the &quot;comfort zones&quot; in Mumbai for British soldiers, and this is embedded within the local origin stories. The most well-known brothel in the area, Pila House, is the hybridisation of its original word: Playhouse. The first venereal disease clinic of Bombay was opened in 1916, being taken over by BMC in 1925. Nearby, Bachchuseth ki Wadi on Foras Road was famous for its &quot;kothewalis&quot; or tawaifs and mujras.

When India gained independence, a larger number of sex workers moved into the area. In recent decades, large numbers of Nepalese women and girls have also been trafficked into the district. Over the years under Indian government rule, the sex industry in Kamathipura continued to flourish. Trafficking and economic circumstances also brought women from different parts of the country there. Eventually it became Asia&#x27;s largest sex district.

In the late 1980s, the rise of AIDS was partially responsible for the decline of Kamathipura&#x27;s sex industry. Police started cracking down on the brothels and customers declined as the disease spread. Many sex workers left for the suburbs or other cities. From around 50,000 sex workers in 1992, the number of sex workers has been reduced to below 2000.

The brothels in the area are crowded. Sex workers wait outside to pick up customers and then rent an available bed. The estimated 3,000 buildings in the area are largely dilapidated; safe drinking water and sanitation is scarce as well.

Some historical sources point out that the origin of slums, subsequently the red-light areas of Mumbai including Kamathipura is related to land acquisition, from the indigenous population who were evicted from their farmlands and cattle-fields and forced to live in congested conditions, to facilitate the development of the industrial harbor city. In the early stages, people accumulated in the new slums partly depended on constructions contracts. Later, as men became unemployed due to lack of jobs, more women began to engage in sex work in order to survive. Gang activity also increased in the area; in the 1970s and early &#x27;80s, Bachchu Wadi at Kamathipura was frequented by gangleaders from the Mumbai underworld, such as Haji Mastan, Karim Lala, and Dawood Ibrahim.

The 2005 statewide ban on dance bars resulted in many former female dancers resorting to prostitution in Mumbai&#x27;s red-light districts in order to survive. According to police, in 2005, there were 100,000 prostitutes working out of five-star hotels and brothels across Mumbai.

The area is also home to a small cottage industry of about 200 women who make a living rolling beedis (hand-rolled Indian cigarette).

==Demographics==

Kamathipura is divided into roughly 14 lanes and divided according to regional backgrounds of the workers. Most of the workers come from other Indian states. There is little interaction between areas, which makes it harder for social organizations to organize them into a movement or union. Further, lack of public opinion, political leadership or social activism which is empathetic towards them means a tough time forming unions.

The area had 55,936 voters in 2007.

<text>The Bone People, styled by the writer and in some editions as the bone people, is a 1984 novel by New Zealand writer Keri Hulme. Set on the coast of the South Island of New Zealand, the novel focuses on three characters, all of whom are isolated in different ways: a reclusive artist, a mute child, and the child&#x27;s foster father. Over the course of the novel the trio develop a tentative relationship, are driven apart by violence, and reunite. Māori and Pākehā (New Zealand European) culture, myths and language are blended through the novel. The novel has polarised critics and readers, with some praising the novel for its power and originality, while others have criticised Hulme&#x27;s writing style and portrayals of violence.

Hulme spent many years working on the novel, but was unable to find a mainstream publisher willing to accept the book without significant editing; it was eventually published by the small all-women collective, Spiral. After initial commercial success in New Zealand, the book was published overseas and became the first New Zealand novel and first debut novel to win the Booker Prize in 1985, although not without controversy; two of the five judges opposed the book&#x27;s choice for its portrayals of child abuse and violence. Nevertheless, the novel has remained popular into the 21st century, continuing to sell well in New Zealand and overseas, and is widely recognised as a New Zealand literary classic.

==Plot summary==
Kerewin lives in a tower overlooking the sea on the coast of the South Island. She is isolated from her family and interacts little with the local community, but is able to live independently after winning a lottery and investing well. On a stormy afternoon, a young child, Simon, appears at the tower. He is mute and communicates with Kerewin through hand signals and notes. He is picked up the next morning by a family friend; later that evening Simon&#x27;s foster father, Joe, visits Kerewin to thank her for looking after Simon. After a freak storm years earlier, Simon was found washed up on the beach with very few clues as to his identity. Despite Simon&#x27;s mysterious background, Joe and his wife Hana took the boy in. Later, Joe&#x27;s infant son and Hana both died, forcing Joe to bring the troubled and troublesome Simon up on his own.

Kerewin finds herself developing a tentative relationship with the boy and his father. Gradually it becomes clear that Simon is a deeply traumatised child, whose strange behaviours Joe is unable to cope with. Kerewin discovers that, in spite of the real familial love between them, Joe is physically abusing Simon. Horrified, she initially says nothing to Joe, but suggests they travel to her family&#x27;s bach (holiday home) by the beach for a break. Early on in their stay she confronts Joe and asks him to go easier on Simon. Joe and Kerewin argue, and after Simon spits at Joe, she intervenes to stop Joe from beating him, using her aikido skills. Following the incident, Joe promises not to beat Simon without her permission. They spend the rest of their time at the beach fishing, talking and drinking.

After returning home from the holiday, Simon sees the aftermath of a violent death and seeks Kerewin out for support, but she is angry with him for stealing one of her prized possessions. Simon reacts by punching her; she instinctively hits him in the chest and in response he kicks in the side of her guitar, a gift from her estranged mother. Kerewin tells him to get out. Simon goes to the town and breaks a series of shop windows, and when he is returned home by the police Joe calls Kerewin, who gives Joe permission to beat the child (but tells him not to &quot;overdo it&quot;). Joe beats Simon severely, believing he has driven Kerewin away. Simon, who has concealed a shard of glass from a shop window, stabs his father. Both are hospitalised, with Simon falling into a coma. Joe is released quickly but sent to prison for three months for child abuse, and in the meantime Kerewin leaves town and demolishes her tower. 

Simon eventually recovers, albeit with some loss of hearing and brain damage, and is sent to live in foster care against his wishes. He is unhappy and continually runs away, trying to get back to Joe and Kerewin. After Joe&#x27;s release from prison, he travels aimlessly. He jumps off a cliff and nearly kills himself, but is rescued by a dying kaumātua (respected elder) who says he has been waiting for Joe. He asks Joe to take over guardianship of a sacred waka (canoe), containing the spirit of a god, which Joe accepts. In the meantime, Kerewin becomes seriously ill with stomach pains. Although she visits a doctor who says he is concerned it may be stomach cancer, she refuses to allow him to investigate further and insists he write her a prescription for sleeping pills. After several weeks in a mountain cabin, on the point of death, she is visited by a spirit of some kind and cured.

Kerewin returns to her community and takes custody of Simon. Joe also returns, bringing with him the sacred spirit. Without Kerewin&#x27;s knowledge or permission, he contacts Kerewin&#x27;s family, resulting in a joyous reconciliation. The final scene of the novel depicts the reunion of Kerewin, Simon and Joe, celebrating with family and friends back at the beach where Kerewin has rebuilt the old marae (communal meeting house) and rebuilt her home, not as a tower but in the shape of a shell with many spirals.

==Themes and characters==

The novel focuses on three main characters, all of whom are isolated in different ways. In the short prologue at the start of the novel, the then-unnamed characters are described as &quot;nothing more than people by themselves&quot;, but together &quot;the hearts and muscles and mind of something perilous and new, the instruments of change&quot;. The three characters are:
* Kerewin Holmes – Kerewin lives in an isolated tower by the sea, estranged from her family and community. She is part-Māori, part-Pākehā, and asexual. She is skilled, knowledgeable and creative, but although seeing herself as a painter finds herself unable to paint. At the outset of the novel she spends her days fishing and drinking. She is often preparing food or eating, which links the novel to traditional Māori storytelling themes of food and its preparation. She has been described as a &quot;clear stand-in for the author&quot;. Hulme said that Holmes began as an alter-ego character but &quot;escaped out of my control and developed a life of her own&quot;. 
*Simon P. Gillayley – Simon is a mute child, aged six or seven, with an immense interest in details of the world around him. Simon has a deep attachment to both Joe and Kerewin, but he shows his love in odd ways. He exhibits a disregard for personal property. He is isolated from others by his inability to speak, and others mistake his muteness for stupidity. His life before meeting Joe is never described in detail, although it is hinted that he was abused before meeting Joe. He is Pākehā, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
*Joe Gillayley – Joe is Simon&#x27;s foster father. His alcoholism clouds his judgement, particularly in his raising of Simon, whom he physically abuses. Joe seems to both love and respect Kerewin, but also to compete with her. He is deeply scarred and isolated by the death of his wife and infant child, and he is disconnected from his Māori heritage.

The relationship between these three troubled characters is characterised by violence and difficulty in communicating. Violence, pain and suffering appear frequently in the novel, most notably through Joe&#x27;s beating of Simon, but also through the characters&#x27; spiritual pain and isolation. Both Kerewin and Joe are estranged from their Māori heritage and identity, and both have lost their families. All three characters experience near-death experiences over the course of the novel. Some critics have described Simon as a Christ-like figure in his suffering and his salvation of Joe and Kerewin, although Hulme herself has rejected this comparison, saying &quot;none of his suffering is for anyone else&quot;.

Over the course of the novel the three characters bond and become &quot;the bone people&quot;. In Māori, the term iwi, usually referring to a tribal group, literally means &quot;bone&quot;. Thus, in the novel, Simon imagines Joe saying the phrase &quot;&quot;, which the book&#x27;s glossary explains: &quot;It means, O the bones of the people (where &quot;bones&quot; stands for ancestors or relations), or, O the people of the bones (i.e. the beginning people, the people who make another people).&quot; Each character represents aspects of New Zealand&#x27;s racial culture. Through their love of Simon and acceptance of Māori myth into their lives, Joe and Kerewin are able to transform themselves. The &quot;Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; describes the three as becoming &quot;a new multicultural group, founded on Māori spirituality and traditional ritual, who offer transformative hope to a country stunted by the violence of its divided colonial legacy&quot;.

The relationship between Joe and Kerewin is not a sexual one, although Joe does consider Kerewin as a possible partner and the two form a close bond that is akin to a romantic relationship or a parental one with Simon. At the end of the book Joe and Simon take her last name, not for sentimental reasons but for what Kerewin describes as &quot;good legal sense&quot;. Critic C.K. Stead has said he considers this to be the &quot;imaginative strength&quot; of the work: &quot;that it creates a sexual union where no sex occurs, creates parental love where there are no physical parents, creates the stress and fusion of a family where there is no actual family&quot;.

The spiral form frequently appears as a symbol throughout the novel, and is linked to the koru as an &quot;old symbol of rebirth&quot; in Māori culture. An early review by New Zealand writer and academic Peter Simpson noted how particularly apt it was for the book to have been published by the Spiral collective, because &quot;the spiral form is central to the novel&#x27;s meaning and design; it is in effect the code of the work informing every aspect from innumerable local details to the overall structure&quot;. It represents the sense of community, cultural integration and open-endedness that gives the characters hope at the end of the novel.

==Style==
The novel is divided into four sections of three parts each, loosely covering the four seasons of a year. Much of the narration is from the perspective of Kerewin, and predominantly in the third-person, but some sections are told from the perspective of Joe or Simon, including those sections which relate to Joe&#x27;s violent beating of Simon. The prose is often in a stream of consciousness or poetic style denoting characters&#x27; inner thoughts. It also incorporates use of the Māori language, usually untranslated in the text, but with a glossary at the back of the book. The novel frequently features the dreams of the three characters, and in the final section the narrative shifts from realism to mysticism. 

&quot;The Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; observes that the novel requires active concentration from the reader, given the mixture of poetry and prose, New Zealand slang and Māori phrases, realistic and supernatural elements, and tonal shifts from ordinary and banal to lyrical and sacred. Judith Dale, in a review for &quot;Landfall&quot;, describes Hulme&#x27;s writing as &quot;highly idiosyncratic, often florid, with a wide lexical range&quot;; the book &quot;abounds with literary allusions, arcane references and a self-conscious use of language that depends on wide and esoteric reading&quot;. Merata Mita describes the writing as &quot;reminiscent of musical patterns in jazz&quot;.

==Publication history==
As a teenager in the mid-1960s, Hulme began writing short stories about a mute child called Simon Peter. She continued to write about this character and develop the material which would eventually form a novel into adulthood, while working a series of short seasonal jobs such as tobacco-picking and later working as a journalist and television producer. The novel&#x27;s two other key characters, Kerewin Holmes and Joe Gillayley, were developed at a later stage.

When Hulme began submitting her draft novel to publishers, she was told to trim it down and rewrite it; she reworked the manuscript seven times, with some assistance from her mother on editing the early chapters. In 1973 she moved to Ōkārito, on the West Coast of the South Island, where the book was completed. At least four publishers rejected the novel; at least two did not refuse it outright but required it to be edited significantly. Hulme refused, however, to allow them to &quot;go through [her] work with shears&quot;. In rejecting the manuscript, William Collins, Sons wrote: &quot;Undoubtedly Miss Hulme can write but unfortunately we don&#x27;t understand what she is writing about.&quot;

Hulme had almost given up on publication when she met Marian Evans, a founder of the Women&#x27;s Gallery and a member of the women&#x27;s publishing collective Spiral. She later recorded that she had reached the point of deciding to embalm the manuscript in resin and use it as a doorstop. In 1981, Hulme sent Evans a copy of the manuscript, which Evans passed onto Māori leaders Miriama Evans (no relation to Marian) and Irihapeti Ramsden. Both Miriama and Ramsden saw the book as a Māori novel, with Ramsden comparing Hulme&#x27;s writing to her childhood experiences of listening to Māori elders share oral traditions and stories. They decided to publish the work as a Spiral collective, on a limited budget but with help from other supporters and institutions. It was typeset by the Victoria University of Wellington Students&#x27; Association, and proofread by members of Spiral (Marian later acknowledged that the proofreading &quot;was uneven, dependent on the skills of various helpers&quot;). The novel&#x27;s publication was also supported by a couple of small grants from the New Zealand Literary Fund.

The first edition, a print-run of 2,000 copies published in February 1984, sold out in weeks. After the second edition sold out similarly quickly, Spiral collaborated with English publishing house Hodder &amp; Stoughton to co-publish the third edition. A further 20,000 copies were sold of this edition. The first American edition was published by Louisiana State University Press in 1985. The novel has been translated into nine languages (Dutch, Norwegian, German, Swedish, Finnish, Slovak, French, Danish and Spanish). In 2010 it was one of six novels comprising Penguin Books&#x27; &quot;Ink&quot; series, a subset of 75 titles re-released in celebration of the publishing house&#x27;s 75th anniversary, each with jacket art &quot;specially designed by some of the world&#x27;s best artists working in the world of tattoos and illustration&quot;. The cover features art by New Zealand tattoo artist Pepa Heller.

==Reception==

The novel polarised readers and reviewers, receiving both critical acclaim and strong criticism. The &quot;Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature&quot; considers that the novel &quot;must be acknowledged as one of contemporary New Zealand literature&#x27;s most powerful rewritings of the ideology of nationalism and a prophetic vision of New Zealand&#x27;s multicultural future.&quot; It was praised by authors such as Alice Walker, who said in a letter to Spiral that it &quot;is just amazingly wondrously great&quot;, and fellow New Zealand author Witi Ihimaera, who said he &quot;was totally amazed that a book that I knew had been put together by a small feminist publication company had made it to the top of the literary world&quot;. Publisher Fergus Barrowman said: &quot;It was fantastic, unlike anything else. It completely enlivened and altered my sense of New Zealand literature.&quot; 

On the other hand, some reviewers have criticised the book&#x27;s style and Hulme&#x27;s writing. Agnes-Mary Brooke, writing for &quot;The Press&quot;, called it &quot;grandiose, inflated nonsense&quot;. Fleur Adcock said it was &quot;hard to be sure whether this remarkable novel is a masterpiece or just a glorious mess&quot;; in response, Judith Dale asked whether the novel&#x27;s unsettled structure formed part of the appeal: &quot;Mystery or muddle, mess or masterpiece, is it precisely the unresolved, unsettling, unsettled and dissolving strands of &quot;the bone people&quot; which make up its attraction for other readers as for me?&quot; More recently, Sam Jordison, reviewing the book in 2009 for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, described Hulme&#x27;s writing as a &quot;morass of bad, barely comprehensible prose&quot;, and felt that by the end of the novel &quot;the-all-too realistic story of abuse and trauma breaks down into absurd mysticism&quot;.

New Zealand academic and writer C. K. Stead suggested in a 1985 article that Hulme should not be identified as a Māori writer, on the basis that she was only one-eighth Māori. He praised the novel however for its &quot;imaginative strength&quot; and said it was at its core &quot;a work of great simplicity and power&quot;; years later he described the work as &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s finest novel&quot;. His views on Hulme&#x27;s identity were controversial, with other critics at the time calling them racist and reactionary. Hulme said in response to Stead&#x27;s comments on her racial identity that he was &quot;wrong, on all counts&quot;. In 1991 Hulme and other authors withdrew stories from an anthology Stead was engaged to edit, with Hulme citing his &quot;extensive history of insult and attack that surrounds [his] relations with Maori and Polynesian writers&quot;.

Stead and other critics have called attention to the way that the novel describes Simon being violently abused, yet also treats the perpetrator, Joe, as a sympathetic character. Stead criticised the novel for its portrayals of violence and child abuse; in his words, the book leaves &quot;a bitter aftertaste, something black and negative deeply ingrained in its imaginative fabric&quot;. In response, other critics have said the child abuse in the novel is allegorical, and that the violence is condemned by characters in the novel including by Joe himself. Merata Mita observed that Joe&#x27;s violence towards Simon reflects the colonial violence inflicted by the British on the Māori people. Hulme herself has said she wanted to draw attention to the problem of child abuse in New Zealand, which is often not spoken about.

The novel received praise from overseas publications. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a novel of &quot;sweeping power&quot; and an &quot;original, overwhelming, near-great work of literature, which does not merely shed light on a small but complex and sometimes misunderstood country, but also, more generally, enlarges our sense of life&#x27;s possible dimensions&quot;. Peter Kemp in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; concluded that &quot;for all its often harrowing subject-matter, this first novel from a New Zealand writer radiates vitality ... New Zealand&#x27;s people, its heritage and landscapes are conjured up with uncanny poetry and perceptiveness&quot;. Claudia Tate for &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the novel &quot;provocative&quot;, and said it &quot;summons power with words, as in a conjurer&#x27;s spell&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1984, the novel won the New Zealand Book Award for Fiction. The following year it won the Pegasus Prize for Literature, which that year had been earmarked for Māori fiction by Mobil who sponsored the Pegasus Prize and the &quot;Te Maori&quot; exhibition in New York in 1984. It subsequently became the first New Zealand novel and first debut novel to win the Booker Prize. 

The judges of the 1985 Booker Prize were Norman St John-Stevas, Joanna Lumley, Marina Warner, Nina Bawden and Jack Walter Lambert. The judges were split on &quot;The Bone People&quot; as winner: Lumley and Bawden opposed it, with Lumley arguing that the book&#x27;s subject matter of child abuse was &quot;indefensible&quot;, &quot;no matter how lyrically written&quot;. The other three were in favour; Warner considered it &quot;a really extraordinary achievement, a very, very unusual piece of writing, the writing on every page springs surprises&quot;. St John-Stevas, who sat as chairman of the judging panel, said it was a &quot;a highly poetic book, filled with striking imagery and insights&quot;.

Hulme was unable to attend the Booker Prize ceremony as she was in the United States at the time on a promotional tour following her receipt of the Pegasus Prize. She was called from the awards ceremony, and her response (broadcast live on television) was, &quot;You&#x27;re pulling my leg, aren&#x27;t you? Bloody hell.&quot; Irihapeti Ramsden, Marian Evans and Miriama Evans of Spiral attended the ceremony itself on her behalf. They recited a karanga (Māori call) as they accepted the award, which led to Philip Purser of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; describing them as &quot;a posse of keening harpies&quot;. The reaction to the win was generally one of surprise; it was described by Philip Howard for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as a &quot;dark horse&quot; and a &quot;controversial choice&quot;, and by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the strangest novel ever to win the Booker&quot;.

When asked what the Booker Prize meant to her, Hulme said: &quot;The difference will be having a large amount of money and being able to keep doing the things I like – reading, writing, painting, fishing and building.&quot; David Lange, prime minister at the time, sent her a congratulatory telegram, ending with: (&quot;And so, to you, a flower of Aotearoa, this loving greeting&quot;).

==Legacy==
The novel&#x27;s popularity has endured into the 21st century; in 2004, it remained in the New Zealand fiction bestseller list. In 2005, a public conference was held at the Stout Research Centre at Victoria University of Wellington to mark 20 years since the Booker Prize win. In 2006, the novel was voted New Zealand&#x27;s favourite book in a public poll as part of the inaugural NZ Book Month. In 2018, it came third in two separate polls by &quot;The Spinoff&quot; of the favourite New Zealand books of readers and literary experts respectively. It is the favourite novel of New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern. In 2022, it was included on the &quot;Big Jubilee Read&quot; list of 70 books by Commonwealth authors, selected to celebrate the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

Hulme died in December 2021. Her &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary reported that the book had at that time sold over 1.2 million copies. In July 2022, her family announced that the original novel manuscript would be sold at auction, with the proceeds to be used to support Māori authors, in accordance with Hulme&#x27;s final wishes. The estimated sale price was 35,000 to $50,000; it sold for $55,000.

<text>AIDS-related lymphoma describes lymphomas occurring in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

A lymphoma is a type of cancer arising from lymphoid cells. In AIDS, the incidence of non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, primary cerebral lymphoma and Hodgkin&#x27;s disease are all increased. There are three different varieties of AIDS-related lymphoma: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma, and Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma (small non-cleaved cell lymphoma).

== Signs and symptoms ==
The histologic classification of the lymphoma, as well as the locations and severity of the disease, all influence the clinical presentation of HIV-related lymphomas. HIV-related lymphomas are more likely to present with advanced stage disease, constitutional symptoms (also known as &quot;B&quot; symptoms; fever, weight loss, and night sweats), extranodal involvement, or disease involving unusual locations (such as the body cavity or soft tissue) than lymphomas in the HIV-negative population.

HIV-related lymphomas can present with a variety of clinical symptoms, including organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and/or constitutional symptoms. Unknown fever, cytopenias, tumor lysis syndrome (including lactic acidosis, hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase), and other isolated laboratory abnormalities (such as hypercalcemia) are observed in certain patients.

== Causes ==
HIV-positive individuals&#x27; lymphomas vary widely and can be classified into several histologic subtypes. The two primary lymphoma types that develop in HIV-positive individuals are non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma (HL).

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a highly aggressive type of B-cell lymphoma. It is distinguished by the widespread proliferation of large neoplastic B lymphocytes with nuclei that are equal to or larger than normal histiocytic nuclei. The illness manifests with B symptoms at an advanced stage of the illness. It mostly affects patients who are severely immunosuppressed and can occur at nodal or extranodal sites, with the gastrointestinal tract being the most common site. It makes up between 45 and 50 percent of all lymphomas seen in this group, making it the most prevalent AIDS-associated lymphoma subtype. All ages are affected by DLBCL, which typically manifests as a rapidly growing lymph node mass in the neck or abdomen.&lt;ref name=&quot;HIV/AIDS Associated Lymphoma&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 40% of patients have extranodal extramedullary disease, and about 30% of patients exhibit B symptoms.

The second most prevalent NHL subtype that affects HIV-positive individuals with a comparatively high CD4 cell count is Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma. Patients typically have elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels and poor performance status. The central nervous system is involved in 8 to 28% of cases, with extranodal involvement occurring more frequently. It usually manifests at a younger age and with CD4 cell counts greater than 200 cells/μL. It develops quickly and is a kind of tumor that starts from B cells. In addition, it is fatal if untreated. Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma is linked to a high incidence of oral cavity involvement and makes up 10-15% of AIDS-defining lymphomas. Three clinical subtypes of Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma have been identified: endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency-related. Thirty to forty percent of AIDS-related NHL cases are Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma subtype, which is most prevalent in HIV/AIDS patients.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a subtype of NHL that impacts the eyes, brain, spine, and cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system. It appears in patients who have severe immune suppression; since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, its incidence has declined in these patients. The majority of PCNSL linked to HIV is Epstein-Barr virus positive. Furthermore, unlike HIV-negative PCNSL, patients typically present with multiple brain lesions and/or changes in mental status or focal neurologic symptoms. Changes in mental state, intracranial pressure symptoms (headache, nausea, vomiting, papilledema), and local compression symptoms (epilepsy, memory loss, unstable gait, visual impairment, slurred speech) are the most common symptoms of PCNSL.

Primary effusion lymphoma is a distinct subtype of aggressive B-cell NHL. It is brought on by HHV8, commonly referred to as KSHV, or Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. It is uncommon, making up 0.3% of NHL in the general population and 4% of NHL linked to HIV. Between 60 and 90 percent of cases of primary effusion lymphoma have EBV co-infection, although its pathogenesis is unknown. There are malignant lymphomatous effusions in the pericardium, peritoneal cavity, and pleural space.

Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) originates from terminally differentiated, activated B-cells at the post-germinal center that are changing from immunoblasts to plasma cells. About 2% of all AIDS-associated lymphomas are PBL-associated lymphomas. HIV infection is closely associated with this uncommon form of lymphoma, which primarily affects the oral cavity.

 With a widespread proliferation of massive neoplastic cells that resemble B-cell immunoblasts but have the immunophenotype of plasma cells, it is incredibly aggressive.

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is one of the most common cancers that do not indicate AIDS, and since highly active antiretroviral therapy was introduced, its incidence has increased. It is a germinal center-derived cell that produces Hodgkin Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells. It is more common in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with HIV. Compared to mild immune compromise, the incidence of HL is lower in states of extreme immunodeficiency. It&#x27;s possible that there was insufficient immunological contact between non-neoplastic inflammatory cells and HRS cells.

== Mechanism ==
HIV-positive patients have a higher incidence of malignancies for a variety of reasons. These consist of inflammation, cytokine dysregulation, and persistent antigenic stimulation. Moreover, oncogenic viruses are more likely to infect HIV/AIDS patients. Thus, a variety of factors, such as a compromised immune system, genetic changes, viral infection, and persistent B cell activation, contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV/AIDS-associated lymphoma.

<text>A debasement of coinage is the practice of lowering the intrinsic value of coins, especially when used in connection with commodity money, such as gold or silver coins, while continuing to circulate it at face value. A coin is said to be debased if the quantity of gold, silver, copper or nickel in the coin is reduced.

==Examples==
===Roman Empire===
In Roman currency, the value of the denarius was gradually decreased over time as the Roman government altered both the size and the silver content of the coin. Originally, the silver used was nearly pure, weighing about 4.5 grams. From time to time, this was reduced. During the Julio-Claudian dynasty, the denarius contained approximately 4 grams of silver, and then was reduced to 3.8 grams under Nero. The denarius continued to shrink in size and purity, until by the second half of the third century, it was only about 2% silver, and was replaced by the Argenteus.

===Ottoman Empire===
Weight of akçe in grams of silver and index.
==Effects==
Debasement lowers the intrinsic value of the coinage and so more coins can be made with the same quantity of precious metal. If done too frequently, debasement may lead to a new coin being adopted as a standard currency, as when the Ottoman akçe was replaced by the kuruş (1 kuruş = 120 akçe), with the para (1/40 kuruş) as a subunit. The kuruş in turn later became a subdivision of the lira.

== Methods ==
An administrative method to debase currency is for the mint to start issuing coins of a certain face value, but with less metal content than previous issues. There will be an incentive to bring the old coins to the mint for re-minting – see Gresham&#x27;s law. A revenue, called seigniorage, is made on this minting process.
When done by an individual, precious metal was physically removed from the coin, which could then be passed on at the original face value, leaving the debaser with a profit. This physical debasement was effected by several methods, including clipping (shaving metal from the coin&#x27;s circumference) and sweating (shaking the coins in a bag and collecting the dust worn off).

Until the mid-20th century, coins were often made of silver or (rarely) gold, which were quite soft and prone to wear. This meant coins naturally got lighter (and thus less valuable) as they aged, so coins that had lost a small amount of bullion would go unnoticed. Modern coins used as currency are made of hard, cheap metals such as steel, copper, or a copper-nickel alloy, reducing wear and making it difficult and unprofitable to debase them.

=== Coin clipping ===

Clipping is the act of shaving off a small portion of a precious metal coin for profit. Over time, the precious metal clippings could be saved up and melted into bullion or used to make new coins.

Coin clipping was usually considered by the law to be of a similar magnitude to counterfeiting, and was occasionally punished by death, a fate which befell English counterfeiters Thomas Rogers and Anne Rogers in 1690. Even among pirates, clipping coins was considered a serious breach of trust. Henry Avery&#x27;s pirate fleet attacked the treasure ship &quot;Gunsway&quot; in 1695 and netted one of the largest pirate captures in history. When fellow pirate William May&#x27;s crew were found to have traded clipped coins to Avery&#x27;s crew, Avery took back nearly all the treasure he had shared with May and his men and sent them away.

Coin clipping is why many coins have the rim of the coin marked with stripes (&quot;milling&quot; or &quot;reeding&quot;), text (&quot;engraving&quot;) or some other pattern that would be destroyed if the coin were clipped. This practice is attributed to Isaac Newton, who was appointed Master of the Royal Mint 1699. Although most modern fiat coins have no value, modern milling can be a deterrent to counterfeiting, an aid to the blind to distinguish different denominations, or purely decorative.

=== Sweating ===

In the process of sweating, coins were placed in a bag and shaken. The bits of metal that had worn off the coins were recovered from the bottom of the bag. Sweating tended to wear the coin in a more natural way than clipping, and so was harder to detect.

=== Plugging ===
If the coin was large, a hole could be punched out of the middle, and the face of the coin hammered to close up the hole. Or the coin could be sawn in half, and a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be welded back together again. Verbal references to plugged quarters and plugged dimes eventually yielded the common phrase &quot;not worth a plugged nickel&quot; (or &#x27;plug nickel&#x27;, or even a plugged cent), emphasizing the worthlessness of such a tampered coin.

==Related uses==

*&quot;Debasement&quot; is also sometimes used to refer to the tendency of silver or gold coins to be &quot;shaved&quot;, that is, to have small amounts shaved off the edges of the coins by unscrupulous users, thereby reducing the actual precious metal content of the coin. In order to prevent this, silver and gold coins began to be produced with milled edges, as many coins still do by tradition, although they no longer contain valuable metals. For example, the U.S. quarter and dime have milled edges. Coins that have traditionally been made purely of base metals, such as the U.S. nickel or the penny, are more likely to have unmilled edges.
*By analogy, &quot;debased currency&quot; is sometimes used for anything whose value has been reduced, such as &quot; is an utterly debased currency&quot;

<doc id="632643" wikidata="Q1386684" url="?curid=632643" title="Women's FA Cup">
<text>The Women&#x27;s FA Challenge Cup is the top annual cup tournament for women&#x27;s clubs in English football. Founded in 1970, it has been named the WFA Cup, FA Women&#x27;s Cup, and now Women&#x27;s FA Cup (currently known as the Adobe Women&#x27;s FA Cup for sponsorship reasons).

Designed as an equivalent to the FA Cup in men&#x27;s football, the competition began in 1970–71 as the Mitre Challenge Trophy, organised by the Women&#x27;s Football Association (WFA). There were 71 entrants, including teams from Scotland and Wales.

The WFA ran the competition for the first 23 editions, during which time Southampton won the cup eight times. The Football Association (FA) began administering English women&#x27;s football in mid-1993.

Arsenal holds the record for most titles overall, having won fourteen times. The current cup holders are Manchester United, who defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4–0 in the 2024 final to win their first FA Cup title.

== Name ==

The competition, founded in 1970, was sponsored as the &quot;Mitre Challenge Trophy&quot; until April 1976.

As a Women&#x27;s Football Association competition until 1992–93, it was known as the &quot;WFA Cup&quot; or more informally as the &quot;Women&#x27;s FA Cup&quot;. After the running of the competition passed to the FA in 1993–94, the Association renamed it as the &quot;FA Women&#x27;s Cup&quot;, until 2015. The name was officially reworded as the &quot;Women&#x27;s FA Cup&quot; in June 2015, before that year&#x27;s final. The tournament rules, as in the men&#x27;s FA Cup, name it the &quot;Women&#x27;s FA Challenge Cup&quot;.

== History ==
Previous national cup competitions included the English Ladies Football Association Challenge Cup in 1922, won by Stoke Ladies.

The first women&#x27;s Mitre Challenge Trophy matches were played in 1970, and the first final was held on 9 May 1971 at Crystal Palace National Sports Centre. The WFA was initially named the &quot;Ladies Football Association of Great Britain&quot;, and Scottish clubs were successful in reaching the first three finals of this tournament (albeit as runners-up). Two of these clubs were runners-up in England while also winning the Scottish Women&#x27;s Cup in the same season, Stewarton Thistle in 1971 and Westthorn United in 1973.

Southampton Women&#x27;s F.C. won eight of the first 11 WFA Cup competitions.

Doncaster Belles reached nearly every final between 1982–83 and 1993–94, and won the trophy six times.

== Format ==
The current entry points as of the 2024–25 season:

* the second qualifying round for Tier 5 teams (92 teams)
* the third qualifying round for FA Women&#x27;s National League Division One teams (48 teams)
* the second round proper for FA Women&#x27;s National League North &amp; South Premier Division teams (24 teams)
* the third round proper for Women&#x27;s Championship teams (11 teams)
* the fourth round proper for Women&#x27;s Super League teams (12 teams)

All other clubs enter in the first qualifying round.

== Trophies ==
The original Mitre Challenge Trophy has &quot;disappeared&quot;, according to the WFA History records. This cup was replaced in May 1979 when the Football Association donated a new trophy for the competition&#x27;s winners, to mark the WFA&#x27;s tenth anniversary.

1970–71 cup winner Sue Lopez said it was suspected that a player &quot;tucked it away somewhere in a trophy cabinet&quot;, and she was trying to locate the original cup for the National Football Museum in 2015.

The current Women&#x27;s FA Cup trophy was one of the first prestigious trophies to be made in the Thomas Lyte silver workshop.

==List of finals==
The following is a list of Women&#x27;s FA Cup seasons and final results.

==Results by team==


==Media coverage==
===United Kingdom===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, television coverage of the WFA final was provided by Channel 4.

Between 2001 and 2008, the final of the tournament was covered by the BBC and presented by Celina Hinchcliffe, Rebecca Lowe, Ray Stubbs and Jake Humphrey; the punditry team was usually current players like Sue Scott and commentary usually by Steve Wilson and Lucy Ward or Faye White and always played on the May Day bank holiday. The final was also simulcast on BBC Radio 5 Live. In 2009, the final was shown on most of the stations in the ITV1 network, with commentary from Jon Champion and Lucy Ward. Sky Sports secured a three-year deal for live coverage from 2010 until 2012.

==Sponsorship==
Sponsors of the original WFA competition (1970–1993) included Mitre, Pony wines and Mycil.

In the FA competition, the sponsors have been UK Living (1995–1998), AXA (1998–2002), Nationwide Building Society (2002–2006) and E.ON (2006–2011). From 2007, Tesco obtained additional branding and advertising rights through their partnership agreement with the FA.

Despite sponsorship by these major companies, entering the tournament has actually cost clubs more than they often get in prize money. In 2015 it was reported that even if Notts County had won the tournament outright the paltry £8,600 winnings would leave them out of pocket. The winners of the men&#x27;s FA Cup in the same year received £1.8 million, with teams not even reaching the first round proper getting more than the women&#x27;s winners.
In September 2020, the FA announced that health and life insurance and investment company VitalityHealth had signed a deal to become the sponsor of the competition until July 2023.

In November 2023, after three years with Vitality, the FA announced that Adobe Inc. would become the sponsor of the competition for three years, through to July 2026. The partnership would focus on &quot;increasing fan engagement and raising the profile of the competition&quot;. In addition, all 460 clubs that participate in the competition would gain access to, and training on Adobe Express, a graphic design tool.

<text>The Chichester Canal is a ship canal in England. Partly navigable, its course is essentially intact and runs from the sea at Birdham on Chichester Harbour to Chichester through two locks. The canal (originally part of the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal) was opened in 1822 and took three years to build. The canal could take ships of up to . Dimensions were limited to long, wide and a draft of up to . As denoted by the suffix -chester, Chichester is a Roman settlement (Noviomagus Reginorum), and 300 Denarii were unearthed when Chichester Basin was formed in the 1820s.

==History==

===Planning, construction and early operation===
Proposals for a canal linking Chichester directly to the sea go back as least as far as 1585 when an act of Parliament was passed allowing a cut linking Chichester with the sea. Further proposals were made in the early 19th century, with schemes being proposed in 1801, 1802, 1803 and 1811, but none of these came to pass and as a result the first link to the sea was via a branch of the Portsmouth and Arundel Canal opened in 1822. In 1817 it had been decided that the section between Chichester and Chichester Harbour, unlike the rest of the canal, would be built large enough to carry boats of 100 tons. Putting this into practice required a new act of Parliament which was obtained in 1819. In the same year the construction of the Chichester branch began. In digging out of the basin a hoard of 300 Denarii was found. The section of the canal that would become the Chichester Canal was formally opened on 9 April 1822

The Portsmouth and Arundel Canal was conceived as part of a bigger plan to provide a secure inland canal route from London to Portsmouth, but by the time the route was completed, the war with France had ended. With the reason for its construction removed, the canal was not a commercial success, and apart from the Chichester section, it had fallen into disuse by 1847.

===Under the ownership of the Corporation of Chichester===

The canal was transferred to the Corporation of Chichester by the (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. cxxxviii). In November of that year the City Surveyor gave a figure of £1,000 to put the canal back into full working order; key tasks were repair of locks, bridges and the removal of weeds and mud from the channel. By 1898 only 704 tons of goods were carried – tolls for the year were £18. The last recorded commercial traffic was in 1906 when a load of shingle was carried from the Harbour to the basin. In the same year it was found that the swing bridge at Donnington and Birdham needed to be repaired or replaced. Westhampnett Rural District Council wanted to replace them with fixed bridges (which would have blocked the canal) but the Corporation of Chichester wanted to keep the canal open to traffic. By 1923 the corporation appears to have accepted that there would be no further great loads; it authorised and funded fixed bridges.

The canal was officially open for trade until June 1928 before being formally abandoned.

In 1932 the section of the canal between Cutfield Bridge and Salterns lock was reopened to allow yachts to be berthed there. The open section was initially leased by D. S. Vernon but in 1934 he transferred it to the Chichester Yacht Company.

===World War II===
In Britain in World War II the canal towpath was made an anti-tank and anti-barge route by the 4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom) to militate against a German invasion. This entailed dismantling four swing bridges, diversion of some of the Lavant to raise the water by (thus over the towpath) and a low dam above Cutfield bridge. The partial diversion proved hard to control and the fluctuations damaged the canal and a houseboat; argument as to the duty to compensate lasted until June 1947.

===Post war===
In 1953 the canal and surrounding lands were sold to West Sussex County Council for £7,500. The council let plans be known to use part of the canal for road improvement, on opposition and with higher priority issues for funds, these never took place. The section below Cutfield Bridge continued to be leased to the Chichester Yacht Company while the upper part of the canal was leased to Chichester Canal Angling Association.

In January 1994 floodwaters in lower Chichester were diverted into the canal.

A 2009 restoration of Casher&#x27;s Lock was halted due to the presence of water voles.

<doc id="632648" wikidata="Q722359" url="?curid=632648" title="Emmanuel Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, Duke of Aiguillon">
<text>Emmanuel Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, Duke of Aiguillon (; 31 July 17201 September 1788), was a French soldier and statesman, and a nephew of Armand de Vignerot du Plessis, 3rd Duke of Richelieu. He served as the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under King Louis XV. 

==Early life and intrigue==
He was the son of Armand-Louis de Vignerot du Plessis, duc d&#x27;Aiguillon (1683–1750) and Anne-Charlotte de Crussol de Florensac and so the grandson of Hortense Mancini, and until the death of his father, he was known at court as the duc d&#x27;Agénois. He entered the army at the age of seventeen, and at the age of nineteen was made colonel of the Régiment de Brie, which he would hold until 1748. His marriage in 1740 with Louise-Félicité de Bréhan, daughter of the Comte de Plélo, coupled with his connection with the Richelieu family, gave him an important place at court.

Upon the death of King Louis XV&#x27;s mistress, Madame de Vintimille, in childbirth in 1741, the king&#x27;s best friend (and the duc d&#x27;Agénois&#x27; uncle), the manipulative Duke of Richelieu, began to cast about for another candidate to fulfil his royal friend&#x27;s desires, as he did not want Madame de Vintimille&#x27;s older sister, Madame de Mailly, to regain the king&#x27;s affections. He eventually decided upon the younger sister of both Madame de Mailly and Madame de Vintimille, Marie Anne, the widow of the marquis de La Tournelle.

At a masked ball on Shrove Tuesday, 1742, Richelieu led Marie Anne up to the king and introduced them. The beautiful marquise, however, at first rejected the royal advances. She already had a lover, the young duc d&#x27;Agénois, and was not inclined to give him up even for the king&#x27;s sake. As a result, the king conspired with Richelieu, who was the duc d&#x27;Agénois&#x27; uncle, to rid himself of the young suitor. Richelieu was quite anxious to do anything to bring about a liaison between the king and Madame de La Tournelle, because he knew that Madame de Mailly did not view him in a kindly light. The result of their deliberations was that the king, in imitation of the biblical David, sent his rival to fight the Austrians in Italy during the War of the Austrian Succession. The young duke was seriously wounded at the siege of Château-Dauphin (1744). Unlike the husband of Bathsheba, however, the duc d&#x27;Agénois recovered from his injuries and returned to the court in glory.

The king was in despair, but Richelieu, who was a resourceful man, was not one to accept defeat lightly. He sent his nephew to Languedoc, where a beautiful young lady had been instructed to seduce him. This she did most effectively; letters of a very passionate nature were exchanged; the lady despatched those which she received to Richelieu, and in due course they were brought to the notice of Madame de La Tournelle, who, furious at the young duke&#x27;s deceitfulness, turned her attentions to the king.

The duke was later taken prisoner in 1746 and was made a &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; in 1748. He was a member of the so-called &quot;parti devot&quot;, the faction opposed to Madame de Pompadour, to the Jansenists and to the parlement, and his hostility to the new ideas drew upon him the anger of the pamphleteers.

Upon the death of his father in 1750, he became the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon. In 1753, he was appointed commandant (governor) of Brittany and soon became unpopular in that province, which had retained a large number of privileges called &quot;liberties.&quot; He first came into collision with the provincial estates on the question of the royal imposts (1758).

==Invasion of Britain==

In 1759, the duc d&#x27;Aiguillon was hand-picked by the French foreign minister Choiseul to take part in a large-scale invasion of Great Britain. He was to command a force that would land in Scotland to support a Jacobite rising against the Crown. He would then lead his troops southwards, trapping the British defenders in a pincer between themselves and another French force that would land in southern England. The plan was eventually abandoned following the French naval defeat at Quiberon Bay.

The duc d&#x27;Aiguillon finally alienated the &quot;parlement&quot; of Brittany by violating the privileges of the province (1762). In June 1764, the king, at the instance of d&#x27;Aiguillon, quashed a decree of the &quot;parlement&quot; forbidding the levying of new taxes without the consent of the estates, and refused to receive the remonstrances of the &quot;parlement&quot; against the duke.

On 11 November 1765, La Chalotais, the &quot;procureur&quot; of the &quot;parlement&quot;, was arrested, but whether at the instigation of d&#x27;Aiguillon is not certain. The conflict between d&#x27;Aiguillon and the Bretons lasted two years. In the place of the parlement, which had resigned, d&#x27;Aiguillon organised a tribunal of more or less competent judges, who were ridiculed by the pamphleteers and termed the &quot;bailliage d&#x27;Aiguillon&quot;. In 1768, the duke was forced to suppress this tribunal, and returned to court, where he resumed his intrigue with the parti devot and finally obtained the dismissal of the minister Choiseul (24 December 1770).

==Foreign Secretary==
When Louis XV, acting on the advice of Madame du Barry, reorganised the government with a view to suppressing the resistance of the &quot;parlements&quot;, d&#x27;Aiguillon was made Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, with Maupeou and the Abbé Terray (1715–1778) also obtaining places in the ministry. The new ministry, albeit one of reform, was very unpopular and was styled the &quot;triumvirate.&quot; All the failures of the government were attributed to the mistakes of the ministers. Thus, d&#x27;Aiguillon was blamed for having provoked the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of Gustavus III, King of Sweden, in 1772, although the instructions of the comte de Vergennes, the French ambassador in Sweden, had been written by the minister, the Duc de la Vrillère.

D&#x27;Aiguillon, however, could do nothing to rehabilitate French diplomacy; he acquiesced in the first division of Poland, renewed the Family Compact, and, although a supporter of the Jesuits, sanctioned the suppression of the society. After the death of Louis XV, he quarrelled with Maupeou and with the young queen, Marie Antoinette, who demanded his dismissal from the ministry (1774).

==Legacy==
He died forgotten in 1788. The announcement of his death was worded as follows in &quot;Annonces Affiches Avis Bibliothèque nationale Arsenal 8 H 26195 n° 64 septembre-décembre 1788&quot;: 
4 septembre 1788 (probably date of the burial, other sources mention a date of death of 1 September) Emmanuel-Armand Duplessis-Richelieu, duc d&#x27;Aiguillon, pair de France, noble génois, chevalier des ordres du roi, lieutenant général de ses armées, ancien lieutenant de la compagnie des chevau-légers de la garde ordinaire de Sa Majesté, gouverneur général de la haute et basse Alsace, gouverneur particulier des ville, citadelle, parc et château de La Fère, ancien lieutenant général de la province de Bretagne, ancien commandant pour Sa Majesté de ladite province, ancien ministre et secrétaire d&#x27;État des affaires étrangères et de la guerre. Décédé rue de l&#x27;Université, présenté à Saint-Sulpice et transporté à la Sorbonne.

He was the father of Armand-Désiré de Vignerot du Plessis-Richelieu, who succeeded him as Duke of Aiguillon.

<text>Thomas John Ley (28 October 188024 July 1947) was an Australian politician who was convicted of murder in England. He is widely suspected to have been involved in the deaths of a number of people in Australia, including political rivals.

==Early life==
Ley was born on 28 October 1880 in Bath, Somerset, England, one of four children born to Elizabeth (née Bryant) and Henry Ley. His father, who worked as a butler, died in 1882.

In 1886, Ley&#x27;s mother moved the family to Australia along with his maternal grandmother. They settled in Sydney, where he attended Crown Street Public School until the age of 10. He began working as a young boy, initially as a paper-boy and messenger, then later as an assistant in his mother&#x27;s grocery store and as a farm labourer at Windsor. Ley learned shorthand while living in Windsor and at the age of fourteen secured a position as a junior clerk and stenographer with a solicitor on Pitt Street. He joined the office of Norton, Smith &amp; Co. in 1901 and in 1906 became an articled clerk. He was admitted as a solicitor in 1914.

Ley married Emily Louisa (known as &quot;Lewie&quot;) Vernon in 1898, the year she emigrated to Australia from England. Both husband and wife were active in politics: she in the international suffrage movement, and he as a state and federal politician from 1917 to 1928.

== State politics ==

Ley served in the lower house of the New South Wales parliament (1917–25) as member for Hurstville from 1917 to 1920, representing the Nationalist Party, and St George from 1920 to 1925, representing the Progressive Party until 1922. He was a prominent and vocal advocate of proportional representation, which the state adopted in 1919. Both of his electorates were in Sydney&#x27;s southern suburbs.

As a teetotaler, Ley acquired the nickname &quot;Lemonade Ley&quot;, but the temperance movement accused him of betrayal when he supported legislation which eased requirements for the sale of alcohol. It later emerged that Ley was being paid by the brewery lobby. Despite this, he was appointed as New South Wales Minister for Justice from 1922 to 1925 – in the cabinet of Premier Sir George Fuller – and gained a reputation for harsh decisions.

Shortly after he became Minister for Justice, Ley made an official visit to Western Australia and was introduced to Maggie Evelyn Brook, a magistrate&#x27;s wife. Shortly afterwards the magistrate died; Ley acted for her and her daughter in various financial and legal matters.

== Federal politician ==

In 1925, Ley stood for the seat of Barton in the federal House of Representatives. He unsuccessfully tried to bribe his Labor opponent, Frederick McDonald, with a £2,000 share in a property at Kings Cross in return for withdrawing from the ballot. McDonald instead publicly revealed the attempted bribe. Despite that, Ley won the election on a large swing as part of the decisive Coalition victory that year.

Conventional wisdom would have suggested that Ley, as a former senior member of the New South Wales government, would have been considered for a post in the federal cabinet. However, Ley&#x27;s fellow conservatives, including Prime Minister Stanley Bruce, began to have doubts about him after the election. As a result, Ley was not considered for ministerial preferment.

McDonald took the matter of the bribe to court, but disappeared in mysterious circumstances. The case against Ley collapsed for lack of evidence when McDonald failed to appear. While the disappearance may have been a coincidence, later events put the matter in a more sinister light. In 1928, state legislator Hyman Goldstein, another of Ley&#x27;s public critics, was found dead after apparently falling from &quot;Suicide Point&quot; on the cliffs of Coogee. Then a group of businessmen, concerned at Ley&#x27;s reputation for dubious business dealings, appointed Keith Greedor, a former Ley associate turned opponent, to investigate. Travelling to Newcastle by boat, Greedor fell overboard and drowned.

== Return to England ==
After his defeat in the 1928 election, Ley returned to England with Brook, leaving his wife in Australia. Little is recorded of Ley&#x27;s life during the 1930s. About all that can be said for certain is that he used his move to England to start afresh in dubious business ventures, and during the Second World War he was arrested and convicted for black marketeering.

==The Chalk-pit Murder==
In 1946, Brook was living in Wimbledon, and Ley had his house at 5 Beaufort Gardens, London, converted into flats. Ley falsely believed that Brook and a barman called John McMain Mudie were having an affair. Ley persuaded two of his labourers that Mudie was a blackmailer, and together they tortured and killed him. The case became known as the &quot;Chalk-pit Murder&quot; because Mudie&#x27;s body was dumped in a chalk pit on Woldingham Common in Surrey, thirty miles away from Ley&#x27;s home.

With Lawrence John Smith, Ley was tried at the Old Bailey; both were sentenced to death in March 1947. However, both Smith and Ley escaped the noose: Smith&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, while Ley was declared insane and sent to Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane. He died there soon after of a cerebral haemorrhage. He is said to have been the wealthiest person ever to be imprisoned at Broadmoor. He left an estate in New South Wales valued for probate at £744.

Ley&#x27;s wife had followed him to England in 1942. From Broadmoor, Ley wrote letters and poems, and protested his innocence to his wife and children. After his death, his widow returned to Australia. She died at Bowral, New South Wales in 1956.

<text>James Laidlaw Maxwell Senior (Pe̍h-ōe-jī: &quot;Má Ngá-kok&quot;; ; born 18 March 1836 in Scotland – March 1921) was the first Presbyterian missionary to Formosa (Qing-era Taiwan). He served with the English Presbyterian Mission.

Maxwell studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, completing his degree in 1858 with the thesis &quot;The Chemistry and Physiology of the Spleen&quot;. He worked in London at Brompton Hospital and at the Birmingham General Hospital. He was an elder in the Broad Street Presbyterian Church, Birmingham before being sent to Taiwan by the Presbyterian Church of England (now within the United Reformed Church) in 1864. He donated a small printing press to the church which was later used to print the &quot;Taiwan Church News&quot;.

On 16 June 1865, at the urging of missionaries H. L. Mackenzie and Carstairs Douglas, he established the first Presbyterian church in Taiwan, this date now celebrated by the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan as its anniversary. First his mission centred in the then-capital Taiwan Fu (now Tainan City); in 1868 he moved near Cijin (now part of Kaohsiung) where his work, both medical and missionary, became more welcomed. In early 1872 he advised Canadian Presbyterian missionary pioneer George Leslie Mackay to start his work in northern Taiwan, near Tamsui.

He married Mary Anne Goodall (died January 1918) of Handsworth on 7 April 1868 in Hong Kong. They had two sons, John Preston and James Laidlaw Maxwell Jr., both of whom later also became medical missionaries. He retired in London in 1885 where he formed and became the first secretary of the Medical Missionary Association. He and his sons oversaw the construction of in Tainan, the first western-style hospital in Taiwan. The younger J. L. Maxwell served in the Tainan hospital from 1900 to 1923, during Taiwan&#x27;s Japanese era.

<text>John Preston Maxwell (5 December 1871 – 25 July 1961), son of James Laidlaw Maxwell, was a Presbyterian obstetric missionary to China.

John Preston Maxwell was born on 5 December 1871 in Birmingham, where his father Dr James Laidlaw Maxwell, practised medicine. He attended University College School and University College London, before taking his clinical training at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, from which he emerged with a gold medal in obstetrics and went on to work as a resident at St Bartholomew&#x27;s. Then, following his devout Presbyterian faith, Maxwell became a Medical missionary for the English Presbyterian Church and, in about 1898, went to Fujian in China, where he spent the majority of his professional life. He worked at Yungchun Hospital, Fujian, from 1899 to 1919, and Changpoo, Amoy.

He specialised in obstetrics and was a leading authority on foetal osteomalacia. He became a Director of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Union Medical College in Beijing (a teaching hospital funded by the Rockefeller Foundation), President of the Chinese Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and worked as secretary to the medical committee of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Fund for the Relief of Distress in China. He was awarded the Army and Navy Medal by the Chinese Republic and was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1929. Maxwell returned to England at some point after 1935 (possibly as a result of the invasion of Beijing by the Japanese in 1937) and lived at Brinkley, Cambridgeshire. He was elected consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the nearby Newmarket General Hospital. He married Edith Lilly Isaacson in 1899 (who, as a proficient artist, illustrated some of her husband&#x27;s research papers) and they had one daughter, Marjorie Gordon Maxwell (later Steen), born in 1908. John Maxwell died suddenly near his home on 25 July 1961, at the age of 89, his wife having predeceased him on 14 October 1954.

A species of Chinese snake, &quot;Opisthotropis maxwelli&quot;, is named in his honor.

<text>The Presbyterian Church of England was a late-19th century and 20th century Presbyterian denomination in England. The church&#x27;s origins lay in the 1876 merger of the English congregations of the chiefly Scottish United Presbyterian Church with various other Presbyterian congregations in England. In 1972, the Presbyterian Church of England merged with the Congregational Church in England and Wales to become the United Reformed Church.

<text>The Congregational Union of Scotland was a Protestant church in the Reformed tradition.

The union was established in 1812, by 53 churches in Scotland. Its aim was to conduct missions in Scotland, and to support the existing Congregational churches. Much of the impetus for its formation came from Greville Ewing, who formed numerous congregations, and also the Glasgow Theological Academy. The union grew rapidly, with 72 member churches by 1824, and more than one hundred by the end of the decade.

In 1841, James Morison of the United Secession Church was accused of Arminianism, and was expelled. In 1843, he led four United Secession churches in forming the new Evangelical Union. Two years later, this was joined by nine Congregational Union churches who supported John Kirk. Initially strongly Calvinist, the Evangelical Union moved away from this, and focused its activity on promoting abstentionism. By 1896, it had 98 member churches, and it decided to rejoin the Congregational Union.

The Congregational Union first discussed a possible merger with the Congregational Union of England and Wales in 1929, but it ultimately preferred to remain independent. It was a founder member of the Scottish Churches Council, and later supplied the secretary of the multilateral church conventions which ran from the 1960s to the 1990s. The church also played a leading role in Christian Aid Scotland.

In 1928, the Congregational Union appointed the first woman minister of any Scottish church, Vera Finlay.

In 2000, the union merged into the United Reformed Church, with a minority of churches dissenting and instead joining the Congregational Federation.

<text>Marion and Geoff is a BBC television mockumentary in video-diary format, produced by Baby Cow Productions and screened on BBC Two in 2000, with a second series following in 2003. The series starred Rob Brydon as Keith Barret, a naïve taxi driver going through a messy divorce from his wife, Marion, who has had a long-standing affair with her colleague, Geoff. Each episode is presented as a monologue, filmed by a fixed camera in the confines of his car.

The series were written by Brydon and Hugo Blick, and produced and directed by Blick. The associate producer was Steve Coogan.

The script is written in such a way that the viewer can pick up on clues that Keith has not himself realised, such as implications that Keith&#x27;s youngest son is not biologically his.

Keith&#x27;s character is affectionately portrayed as a gentle dunce and draws a great deal of sympathy as the series progresses. He is in denial about his divorce, and somehow always manages to look on the positive side of even the most awful situation. Although he doesn&#x27;t understand it, his life revolves around Marion and her new partner Geoff, and his love for his &quot;little smashers&quot; (his sons, Rhys and Alyn). Despite his faults, Keith is a hard-working and good man.

==Series one==
Series one consists of ten episodes all around nine minutes long. It was first broadcast in 2000. The series was later repeated, with the original segments combined into 30-minute episodes, though episode 7, &quot;The Monkeys&quot;, was not included in this format.

==Series two==
Series two consists of six episodes all 30 minutes long. It was first broadcast in 2003. In this series, Keith returns to the lives of his sons after a period of estrangement. He now works as a chauffeur for a wealthy American family.

<text>Gary Bartz (born September 26, 1940, in Baltimore) is an American jazz saxophonist. He has won two Grammy Awards.

==Biography==

Bartz was first exposed to jazz as the son of the owners of a jazz nightclub in Baltimore. In 1958 he left Baltimore to study at the Juilliard School. In the early 1960s, he performed with Eric Dolphy and McCoy Tyner in Charles Mingus&#x27; Jazz Workshop. He worked as a sideman with Max Roach and Abbey Lincoln before joining Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers. In 1968, he was a member of McCoy Tyner&#x27;s band, Expansions.

In mid-1970, he joined Miles Davis&#x27; band, performing live at the Isle Of Wight festival in August; and at a series of December dates at The Cellar Door club in Washington, D.C. Portions of these shows were initially released on the 1971 &quot;Live-Evil&quot; album, with the entire six performance/four night run eventually released in full on the 2005 &quot;Cellar Door Sessions&quot; box set. He later formed the band Ntu Troop, which combined jazz, funk, and soul.

Bartz was awarded a Grammy for &quot;Best Latin Jazz Performance&quot; for his work on Roy Hargrove&#x27;s &quot;Habana&quot; at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, and for &quot;Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group&quot; for For McCoy Tyner&#x27;s Illuminations at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards.

Bartz was awarded the BNY Mellon Jazz 2015 Living Legacy Award, which was presented at a special ceremony at The Kennedy Center.

In 2019, Revive Music and Bartz celebrated the 50th Anniversary of his &quot;Another Earth&quot; album at Winter Jazzfest in New York City, alongside original member Pharoah Sanders.

<text>The Intrepid&quot; Museum(originally the Intrepid&quot; Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum) is an American military and maritime history museum in New York City. It is located at Pier 86 at 46th Street, along the Hudson River, in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood on the West Side of Manhattan. The museum is mostly composed of exhibits, aircraft, and spacecraft aboard the museum ship , a World War II–era aircraft carrier, as well as a cruise missile submarine named and exhibits on Pier 86. The Intrepid Museum Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization established in 1979, operates the museum.

The museum was proposed in the late 1970s as a way to preserve &quot;Intrepid&quot;, and it opened on August 3, 1982. The Intrepid Museum Foundation filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 after struggling to attract visitors. The foundation acquired USS &quot;Growler&quot; and the destroyer USS &quot;Edson&quot; in the late 1980s to attract guests and raise money, although it remained unprofitable through the 1990s. The museum received a minor renovation in 1998 after it started turning a profit. Between 2006 and 2008, the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum was completely closed for a $115 million renovation. A new pavilion for the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; opened in 2012.

The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum spans three of the carrier&#x27;s decks; from top to bottom, they are the flight, hangar, and gallery decks. Most of the museum&#x27;s collection is composed of aircraft, which are exhibited on the flight deck. Among the museum&#x27;s collection are a Concorde SST, a Lockheed A-12 supersonic reconnaissance plane, and the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The hangar and gallery decks contain a variety of attractions such as exhibit halls, a theater, and flight simulators, as well as individual objects like a cockpit and an air turbine. Several craft and other objects have been sold off or removed from the museum&#x27;s collection over the years. The museum serves as a space for community and national events, such as Fleet Week and awards ceremonies.

==History==

=== Context and founding ===
, an &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carrier, was launched in 1943. She participated in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, and was a recovery ship for space missions. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was supposed to be scrapped after decommissioning in the late 1970s, but Odysseys in Flight, a nonprofit organization founded by Michael D. Piccola and Bruce Sherer, wished to convert &quot;Intrepid&quot; into a museum ship. Odysseys in Flight had initially planned to salvage the carriers or . The United States Navy wanted the organization to raise $3 million for the carrier&#x27;s upkeep. The organization hosted an exhibit at 6 World Trade Center to raise support for the project, and Odysseys in Flight had raised $2 million by March 1979. One of the museum&#x27;s largest supporters was local real estate developer Zachary Fisher, who established the Intrepid Museum Foundation in March 1978 and contributed over $25 million to the museum during his lifetime. Fisher was enthusiastic about the project, eventually attracting other high-profile supporters such as radio and TV personality Arthur Godfrey and actress Maureen O&#x27;Hara. The Navy also hoped that &quot;Intrepid&quot; could be used for recruitment.

Mayor Ed Koch announced plans for the &quot;Intrepid&quot; conversion in mid-April 1981, and the United States Department of the Navy transferred the &quot;Intrepid&quot; to Fisher, who led the nonprofit Intrepid Museum Foundation, on April 27, 1981. The conversion of the carrier&#x27;s top two decks cost $22 million and was funded by $2.4 million in private donations, as well as $15.2 million of tax-exempt bonds and $4.5 million from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. After the New York City Board of Estimate gave the Intrepid Museum Foundation permission to sell tax-exempt bonds in December 1980, the bonds were sold to the public in July 1981. The federal grant was approved in January 1982, even though the project &quot;had nothing to do with housing&quot;. The renovation involved the addition of a theater, several planes on &quot;Intrepid&quot; deck, and aviation and maritime exhibit halls. The carrier&#x27;s navigation and flight bridges were also restored. The city spent around $2.5 million to renovate Pier 86 on the West Side of Manhattan, where &quot;Intrepid&quot; was to be docked. The museum leased the pier from the city for 33 years at $50,000 per year, making annual payments in lieu of taxes totaling $400,000.

&quot;Intrepid&quot; was towed to her permanent home at Pier 86 in June 1982. Following a soft opening on July 4, the museum opened on August 3, 1982, as the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum. This made &quot;Intrepid&quot; the second aircraft carrier in the U.S. to be converted into a museum, after the . Larry Sawinski was named as the museum&#x27;s director of exhibits. When the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum opened, it showcased several aircraft and spacecraft, and it also contained an exhibit on the early history of carriers. The exhibit halls on hangar level (including Pioneer Hall and Navy Hall), as well as the theater, were not completed. Maritime and aviation schools were planned for the lower two decks, the renovation of which was expected to cost $22 million. The museum had 50 paid staff, who worked mostly in the cafeteria, gift shop, and ticket booths; another 100 volunteers were responsible for the museum&#x27;s displays and expansion. The museum&#x27;s opening was expected to create 469 jobs in the surrounding area, though many of these jobs never materialized.

=== 1980s ===
The Intrepid Museum Foundation dedicated the Hall of Honor, the United States&#x27; first archive dedicated to Medal of Honor recipients, on December 10, 1983; the Medal of Honor Society also relocated into offices within the carrier. The museum originally was projected to attract 1.3 to 1.4 million visitors annually, but it recorded only half of this amount in its first year. This forced the museum&#x27;s directors to delay payments on its debt. The museum had recorded 450,000 patrons in 1984, nearly half of the 800,000 annual patrons that were required to break even. Attendance had been negatively impacted because of the lack of nearby public transit, and the museum struggled to raise money despite increasing its ticket prices. Nonetheless, the museum planned to expand by 1984; it had received $250,000 from the Astor Foundation for classrooms and conference rooms, and the New York state government gave $850,000 for historic preservation. Film and television executive Stanley Abrams was named as the museum&#x27;s president in June 1984.

The Intrepid Museum Foundation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1985, declaring $28.4 million in debt and $16.5 million in assets. Only about a third of the museum&#x27;s revenues came from admissions, with the remaining two-thirds coming from grants, donations, or fundraisers and other such events. Nonetheless, museum officials planned to continue normal operations and launch a campaign to attract visitors; Lawrence Sowinski, the director of exhibits, described the museum as &quot;too valuable a resource to close&quot;. Advertising firm McCann-Erickson was hired to promote the museum, running cheap advertisements in newspapers, on the radio, and in New York City Subway cars. The state also provided $1.024 million for the museum in its 1985 budget, though ultimately the museum got $850,000. &quot;Intrepid&quot; was officially designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986, and its annual allocation from the state was raised to $895,000 that year. Investigators announced in early 1987 that members of the Westies gang had engaged in racketeering, stealing $100,000 to $120,000 annually from the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum.

During the late 1980s, the museum had 400,000 annual visitors; its low attendance was attributed to competition from more popular tourist attractions. Additionally, the museum was the only major point of interest on the rundown Hudson River waterfront, in part due to delays in the construction of nearby developments such as Javits Center. The Intrepid Museum Foundation presented a reorganization plan to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in July 1987, in which nearly half of the museum&#x27;s $28.4 million debt would be forgiven, but creditors would only receive a portion of their claims. After successfully exiting bankruptcy proceedings, the museum planned to display a submarine alongside &quot;Intrepid.&quot; Fisher funded the addition of two permanent exhibits in the late 1980s, at which point &quot;Intrepid&quot; had 39 aircraft. , a that carried nuclear Regulus missiles, was towed to the museum in late 1988 and opened to the public the next May. , a that was the last all-gun destroyer in the United States Navy, was displayed at the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum starting in July 1989. At the time, the museum had few repeat visitors, and Fisher hoped that &quot;Growler&quot; and &quot;Edson&quot; would attract returning patrons.

=== 1990s ===
The outbreak of the Gulf War in the early 1990s caused interest in the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum to increase; at the time, the museum was displaying an exhibit on the Gulf War. By early 1991, the museum recorded 5,000 visitors on a typical weekend, more than twice the previous year&#x27;s weekend patronage. The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum received $900,000 from the state, $350,000 from the New York City Board of Education, and $60,000 from the city government annually. All of this funding was eliminated in 1992, forcing the museum to fire a quarter of its staff, and two young men formed the Intrepid Museum Society and raised money through various events. The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum held numerous fundraisers and received $1.1 million from numerous city and state agencies between 1992 and 1996. Despite this, the museum continued to struggle to remain solvent; the &quot;Village Voice&quot; wrote in 1996 that &quot;the continued taxpayer subsidies seem hard to justify&quot;. Although the museum rented Pier 86 from the city for $252,000 annually, it paid no rent between March 1995 and October 1997.

To raise money, the museum tried to acquire the decommissioned amphibious assault ship in 1994, berth her next to &quot;Intrepid&quot;, and use &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; as a heliport. Although the United States Senate approved the plan, residents of the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood objected to the fact that the heliport would cut off their access to Pier 84. That year, the museum received part of a $1 million appropriation earmarked for the restoration of the in Baltimore. The museum remained unprofitable, recording a $1 million loss in 1996. Annual revenue from ticket sales totaled $3 million, less than half of the museum&#x27;s budget; donations and event rentals covered the rest of the budget. Agencies that had loaned planes to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum, such as the Air Force Museum Foundation, expressed concerns that the museum was incapable of properly maintaining the aircraft. After the &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; plan was canceled in early 1996, the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum launched an advertising campaigns to attract patrons; previously, most of its publicity came from word of mouth and public service announcements.

Retired Marine Corps general Donald Ray Gardner replaced Sowinski as the Intrepid Museum Foundation&#x27;s president in September 1996. Gardner laid off staff, sharply restricted expense spending, deaccessioned some costly artifacts, and reduced the number of planes on exhibit. Gardner also planned to add electronic kiosks to attract children, as well as develop an endowment fund. U.S. President Bill Clinton approved $13 million for a renovation of the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in late 1997, over his staff&#x27;s objections to the project; at the time, the museum had 500,000 annual visitors. The next year, Gardner closed the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum for a minor renovation, the first in its history; the museum reopened in February 1998 with two new exhibits. The city waived $600,000 in unpaid rent, as well as future rent payments for Pier 86, in late 1998 after Fisher donated to mayor Rudy Giuliani. By then, the museum received hundreds of thousands of dollars annually from the Navy, the state, and the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.

In mid-1999, retired Marine Corps general Martin R. Steele took over as the Intrepid Museum Foundation&#x27;s president and began planning 15 modifications to exhibits and 17 construction projects, including a $5.25 million renovation of the flight deck. Steele wished to attract students and increase annual patronage to 1.2 million, and he installed interactive kiosks within a year of taking over. Restaurant Associates took over the museum&#x27;s food service the same year to accommodate the high number of after-hours parties and events at the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum. The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum constructed a new visitor center at 46th Street and 12th Avenue that year. In addition, the museum planned to improve Pier 86, build a 245-seat theater, and erect a pedestrian overpass on 12th Avenue.

=== 2000s ===
As part of a project announced in May 2001, Earth Tech Inc. built a cable-stayed bridge connecting the museum to the east side of 12th Avenue. By then, nearly half of the museum&#x27;s patrons hailed from foreign countries, and Steele described the &quot;Intrepid&quot; as the &quot;largest naval museum in the world&quot;. After the September 11 attacks, the museum was temporarily closed and served as temporary field headquarters for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) while they investigated the attacks. Additionally, part of the flight deck was cleared to make way for a temporary helipad. The museum reopened after five weeks and hosted an exhibit commemorating attack victims. The footbridge across 12th Avenue was completed in May 2003 for $11 million. Its construction experienced delays because of difficulties in constructing the foundations and because of the need to decontaminate the site.

A Concorde supersonic aircraft was towed to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in November 2003, making the museum one of two in the United States with a Concorde. In conjunction with this acquisition, the museum created a new exhibit on transatlantic crossings. Also in late 2003, the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum offered to resell &quot;Edson&quot; back to the Navy, citing the fact that the adjacent pier needed to be repaired and could not be used for berthing &quot;Edson&quot;. After &quot;Edson&quot; was removed from the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in 2004, the Navy sold the destroyer to the Saginaw Valley Naval Ship Museum. The Michael Tyler Fisher Center for Education opened within the museum in 2004, and the Fisher Center for Alzheimer&#x27;s Research Foundation, cofounded by the Fishers, occupied some space during the early 2000s. By the middle of that decade, the museum had 750,000 visitors per year, including over 100,000 students; it had recorded ten million all-time visitors by August 2005. The museum spent $17 million annually just on overhead costs.

==== Renovation ====
By June 2006, the Intrepid Museum Foundation executives had notified state and federal governments of their plans to renovate &quot;Intrepid&quot;, though few details of this renovation were disclosed publicly. The foundation had already asked the United States Army Corps of Engineers to help dredge the mud around the keel so tugboats could tow her to a dry dock. That July, the foundation announced that &quot;Intrepid&quot;, along with Pier 86, would undergo renovations and repairs. Initially, the project was supposed to cost $58 million and take 18 months. The project was to be funded with $31 million from the federal government, $17 million from the New York City Council, and $5 million from the state; the city later increased its share to $23 million. &quot;Intrepid&quot; closed on October 1, 2006, in preparation for being towed to a dry dock at the Military Ocean Terminal in Bayonne, New Jersey. Museum officials had decided to tow the carrier away, as they estimated that the project would cost $100 million and take five years if &quot;Intrepid&quot; were left in place.

Just before the renovation was scheduled to begin, &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that corrupt activities may have been involved in the renovation contract for Pier 86, prompting concerns that &quot;Intrepid&quot; and the Intrepid Museum Foundation were being investigated. Furthermore, after the dry dock in Bayonne was found to be deteriorated, museum officials decided to move &quot;Intrepid&quot; to another pier in that city until the dry dock was repaired. The scheduled move on November 6, 2006, was delayed when &quot;Intrepid&quot; propellers stuck in the Hudson River mud, preventing tugboats from moving the ship out of her berth. The Navy and USACE spent $3 million to extricate the carrier, removing of sediment and mud from the propellers and pier., Tugboats made a successful second attempt on December 5, 2006. By the end of the year, &quot;Growler&quot; was also towed to Bayonne for renovation, while the Concorde on Pier 86 was floated to Floyd Bennett Field so the pier could be repaired. The Intrepid Museum Foundation also sold $7.08 million in bonds to fund its continuing operations.

Pier 86 was demolished and rebuilt to accommodate plumbing and cables, which had not been present in the original pier. After sitting at a cruise-ship port for four months, &quot;Intrepid&quot; was towed to dry dock in April 2007 and received exterior modifications, including new paint, new propellers, and a restored hull. After exterior modifications were completed, the carrier was towed to Staten Island, New York, for interior repairs in June 2007, on the anniversary of D-Day. At Staten Island, &quot;Intrepid&quot; facilities were upgraded and expanded; for example, workers replaced on &quot;Intrepid&quot; three top decks. The fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle was restored, the starboard side and flight deck were deoxidized, a new aircraft elevator was installed, and new wiring was installed. The firm of Perkins + Will was hired to redesign several exhibits and create other exhibits within space that had been closed to the public. The exterior renovations were budgeted at $4.8 million, while the interior cost another $6 million to $8 million.

The renovation, including the cost of Pier 86, ultimately cost $115 million or $120 million. The cost overruns almost bankrupted the museum, which asked donors and politicians to contribute an additional $10 million each to the project. The carrier was towed back to Pier 86 at the beginning of October 2008, and the Concorde was moved back to Pier 86. The museum reopened to the public on November 8. Four aircraft were added to the museum&#x27;s collection when the museum reopened. At the time, the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum planned to attract one million annual visitors, with ten percent of this figure being students. Museum officials hired advertising firm Austin &amp; Williams to promote the museum.

===2010s to present===
The museum&#x27;s president Bill White, who had overseen the 2000s renovation, resigned in 2010 and was succeeded the next year by Susan Marenoff-Zausner, who had been the executive director. Before resigning, White had tried to obtain a Space Shuttle for the museum&#x27;s collection. The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum announced in May 2011 that it would acquire the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;. It initially planned to exhibit the Space Shuttle on Pier 86, but then announced plans to display the spacecraft in a parking lot across 12th Avenue, prompting U.S. senator Sherrod Brown to ask that NASA award the shuttle to another museum. The museum took title to the spacecraft that December, after engineers determined that it was safe to fly on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft once again. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was flown to the nearby JFK Airport in April 2012 and then moved by barge to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum that June. To make room for the &quot;Enterprise&quot; display, three aircraft were transferred to the Empire State Aerosciences Museum near Schenectady, New York. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; went on public display July 19, 2012, at the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum&#x27;s new Space Shuttle Pavilion, charging an additional fee for admission.

The museum was closed in October 2012 due to Hurricane Sandy, which damaged &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Although the museum reopened that December, the Space Shuttle Pavilion did not reopen until July 2013. Museum officials contemplated erecting a permanent pavilion for &quot;Enterprise&quot; on Pier 86 or on a parking lot across 12th Avenue. At the time, the museum had 915,000 annual visitors.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the museum was closed between March and September 2020, though it continued to host online events during its closure. The museum&#x27;s Concorde aircraft, which had been displayed on Pier 86, was removed for restoration in 2023 and towed back to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in March 2024. As part of the project, the museum added of park space to Pier 86. The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum dropped &quot;Sea, Air &amp; Space&quot; from its official name in October 2023 as part of a rebranding. In May 2024, the museum opened of space on Pier 86 as a public park. Early the following year, the New York state government announced plans to redevelop one of the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum&#x27;s parking lots on the east side of 12th Avenue.

== Description ==
The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum is located along Hudson River Park at the intersection of 46th Street and 12th Avenue, within the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood on the West Side of Midtown Manhattan in New York City. Most of the collection is on board &quot;Intrepid&quot;, the third &quot;Essex&quot;-class carrier built and one of four preserved &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, besides &quot;Yorktown&quot;, &quot;Lexington&quot;, and . When &quot;Intrepid&quot; was converted into a museum ship, only one-quarter of her area was accessible to the public. Additionally, many of the carrier&#x27;s equipment, including the large airplane elevators, were disabled. One of the carrier&#x27;s former elevators, which transported planes between the flight and hangar decks, was converted into a theater. Due to regulations that require &quot;easy passage&quot;, and to prevent theft, much of &quot;Intrepid&quot; equipment has been removed or relocated.

=== Flight, hangar, and gallery decks ===
The &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum spans three of the carrier&#x27;s decks; due to fire-safety regulations, &quot;Intrepid&quot; other decks remain closed to the public. The carrier&#x27;s topmost deck, the flight deck, showcases many of the museum&#x27;s craft (see ). The Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; is housed within a pavilion on the flight deck, originally within an inflatable tent placed on the stern of &quot;Intrepid&quot;. The superstructure&#x27;s command bridges are accessible to the public. There is a three-inch weapon mount on the carrier&#x27;s island on the starboard side, as well as an anti-aircraft mount in a gun tub on the starboard bow. Also on the flight deck is a plaque marking the spot where a 1944 kamikaze attack killed or injured 22 soldiers.

The museum&#x27;s main entrance has been through the carrier&#x27;s hangar deck, below the flight deck, since 2008. The hangar deck originally contained four permanent exhibit halls, in addition to a space for temporary exhibits. The permanent exhibit halls were Pioneer Hall, which was dedicated to early air travel; Technology Hall, which contained displays about spaceflight; Navy Hall, which had Navy artifacts and a film; and Intrepid Hall, which discussed &quot;Intrepid&quot; role in World War II. The exhibits about the oldest artifacts are toward the rear or aft; the back of the carrier contains a cafeteria, bathrooms, and a terrace on the stern. The hangar deck also contains a space dedicated to Medal of Honor recipients, as well as some aviation artifacts and plaques detailing the carrier&#x27;s history and exhibits. Also on the hangar deck is the Exploreum, an interactive hall with exhibits such as a full-size Bell 47 helicopter. The hangar deck also has a event space called Michael Anthony Fisher Hall, as well as the 245-seat Lutnick Theater, which shows a 16-minute film on the carrier&#x27;s history.

The gallery deck houses the Combat Information Center and Men of the Intrepid exhibits. At the front of the carrier, artifacts from the officers&#x27; quarters are displayed in the fo&#x27;c&#x27;sle, which was opened to the public in 2008. The junior officers&#x27; and general berthing quarters are publicly accessible, and the crew&#x27;s quarters are open to the public as well. There are replicas of two rooms that were created when the mess was subdivided in the 1970s. The middle of the carrier contains a hole that allows visitors to see through seven decks.

The museum originally displayed newsreels of pre–World War II events, dioramas of World War II battles, and models of ships. By the 1990s, the museum also featured an undersea-exploration hall, a children&#x27;s ride, a flight simulator, as well as a bathysphere that was closed to the public. Following the 2008 renovation, the museum has contained three flight simulators, a 4D theater, and interactive exhibits for children. There is also a space dedicated to Zachary Fisher and his wife Elizabeth M. Fisher. The Michael Tyler Fisher Center for Education occupies a three-story space in the museum, with a meeting space, breakout rooms, and classrooms.

=== Other structures ===
There was originally two gift shops: one at the entrance to Pier 86 and one on the hangar deck. The current visitor center at 46th Street and 12th Avenue, completed in 1999, replaces the original visitor center. The new edifice had a metal and glass facade, and it incorporated about one-fourth of the old visitor center. A bridge measuring long connects the museum to a ramp on the eastern side of 12th Avenue. This bridge contains a central tower, as well as sail-shaped fabric canopies.

== Exhibits and collection ==

=== Aircraft ===
All of the aircraft on &quot;Intrepid&quot; flight deck are retired craft that are no longer capable of flying, either due to mechanical problems or because they had flown more than their maximum flight hours. Many of the aircraft lack engines, and some were disassembled before arriving at the museum. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the vast majority of aircraft were transported to the museum by airplane, helicopter, or barge. One aircraft, a Bell AH-1J Sea Cobra gunship, flew to the museum under its own power before its engine was removed. Visitors cannot ordinarily go inside the aircraft.

==== Concorde ====

In 2003, the museum received a Concorde, registered G-BOAD, that had been used by British Airways. This airplane set a world speed record for passenger airliners on February 7, 1996, when it flew between London and New York in 2 hours, 52 minutes and 59 seconds. This airplane logged the most flying hours (23,397) of the 20 Concordes built; it typically occupies an exhibit space on Pier 86.

=== Ships ===
The vast majority of the museum&#x27;s collection is displayed on the &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carrier . Like other &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers, &quot;Intrepid&quot; has a displacement of 27,100 tonnes (26,700 long tons; 29,900 short tons). She has an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . Most of the museum&#x27;s aircraft and spacecraft are on &quot;Intrepid&quot; flight deck (see ).

, a diesel electric submarine which carried out nuclear deterrent patrols armed with Regulus missiles, is berthed next to Pier 86. The submarine is accessed exclusively through a series of narrow oval bulkhead doors and she can only fit roughly twenty guests at once. Due to restrictions created by fire codes, disabled visitors and individuals under forty inches tall cannot enter &quot;Growler&quot;.

=== Spacecraft ===

The museum has two pieces of spacecraft from NASA. One of these is a replica of a NASA &quot;Aurora 7&quot; Mercury capsule. The other is the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which was used as a test orbiter and is located within a pavilion on the flight deck. The museum also contains a Russian Soyuz descent module, which had docked with the International Space Station during the Soyuz TMA-6 mission.

=== Other exhibits ===
The museum has some individual objects in its collection. These include a ram air turbine, salvaged from an F-8 Crusader and restored, as well as a Curtiss Pusher on the hangar deck. The below-decks spaces contain several thousand artifacts, such as a helmet that belonged to an aviation machinist fighting in the Vietnam War. &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated in 2016 that former &quot;Intrepid&quot; crew members and their families donated 10 objects to the museum every month. Artifacts donated by &quot;Intrepid&quot; crew members have included a Royal Navy uniform, gauge, dinner bell, and parachute-packing tool.

=== Temporary and former exhibits ===
The museum has hosted some attractions on a temporary basis; for example, the lightship &quot;Frying Pan&quot; (LV-115) was docked outside the museum during mid-1993. Many objects from the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum&#x27;s collection were loaned from the Army and Navy. In the late 1990s, some of the craft were given back to their respective owners. Numerous other craft were relocated during that time, including the destroyer escort and the lightship &quot;Nantucket&quot; (LV-112). The destroyer &quot;Edson&quot; was given back to the Navy in 2004. Additional objects were returned when the museum&#x27;s renovation commenced in 2006, including a Saturn rocket loaned from the National Air and Space Museum. After the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was lifted onto the &quot;Intrepid&quot; flight deck in 2012, a Douglas F3D Skyknight, a Royal Navy Supermarine Scimitar, and a MiG-15 were transferred to the Empire State Aerosciences Museum. &quot;Growler&quot; was also displayed next to &quot;Intrepid&quot; until 2004. The nose section of a former El Al Boeing 707, 4X-ATA, was put on display in 1985 after the airframe was retired and broken up. During the museum&#x27;s renovations, it was sold to the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Uniondale, New York.

Pier 86 formerly contained a graffitied portion of the Berlin Wall, which was displayed temporarily during the 1990s and early 2000s. This segment of the Berlin Wall weighed and was painted by German artist Kiddy Citny, who gave it to artist Peter Max. Felix de Weldon&#x27;s 1954 sculpture &quot;Iwo Jima Monument&quot; (a smaller version of the Marine Corps War Memorial in Virginia), was installed outside the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in 1995. The monument was removed after the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum closed for renovation in 2006, as the Intrepid Museum Foundation could not afford to buy the monument. A fiberglass model of the Statue of Liberty was given to the then-planned National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum when the &quot;Intrepid&quot; was renovated.

== Governance ==
The Intrepid Museum Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 1979, operates the museum. , Susan Marenoff is listed as the principal officer of the foundation. For the fiscal year that ended in December 2021, the organization recorded $23,304,017 in revenue and $23,432,181 in expenses. In addition to operating the museum, the Intrepid Museum Foundation is associated with programs such as the Intrepid Family Support Fund and the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund, and it distributes funds to families of US armed service members killed in action. The museum also employs some youth through internship programs. As part of the Free Fridays program, admission to the museum is typically waived on selected Fridays during the summer.

==Programming and events==

=== Recurring events ===
The museum serves as an event space for community and national events. For example, it started hosting annual Fleet Week activities in 1988. It continues to host Fleet Week activities every year . During past Fleet Weeks, &quot;Intrepid&quot; has hosted activities including tug-of-war, cooking, and arm wrestling contests, as well as a &quot;Flight Deck Olympics&quot; and exhibitions of ships. In addition, the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum has presented Kids&#x27; Week, a series of activities geared toward children. It held the New York Tugboat Race annually in the 1990s and early 2000s, with events such as line-throwing, nose-to-nose pushing, and spinach-eating contests. The museum has hosted sleepovers since 2009 as part of an event called Operation Slumber, and it also hosts Kids&#x27; Week events during late February.

The Intrepid Museum Foundation issues several awards each year. These include the Intrepid Freedom Award, for political leaders; the Intrepid Salute Award, for philanthropists and businesspeople; the Intrepid Salute Award for the Performing Arts, for performing-arts organizations; the Zachary &amp; Elizabeth Fisher Award for Patriotism; the Intrepid Leadership Award, for community leaders; the Hometown Heroes Award, for residents of the New York metropolitan area who have contributed to the community; and the Intrepid Lifetime Achievement Award, for people who have helped others throughout their lifetime. Recipients of the awards have included U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush; foreign heads of state; members of U.S. presidential cabinets; U.S. Congress members; and mayors of New York City,

=== Other events ===

In the museum&#x27;s first year, the Intrepid Museum Foundation hosted a party to celebrate the &quot;Intrepid&quot; 40th anniversary. Starting in 1982, the &quot;Intrepid&quot; also hosted an annual benefit called Night to Remember, described by &quot;Naval History&quot; magazine as &quot;a black-tie affair with thousands of couples dining and dancing to a swing band&#x27;s music on the flight deck and disco tempos on the hangar deck&quot;. The Intrepid Museum Foundation, in conjunction with Radio City Music Hall Productions, also hosted concerts and other events on the nearby Pier 84 during the late 1980s. Other craft such as the battleship , also berthed outside &quot;Intrepid&quot; for special events in the 1980s. After the Gulf War started, the museum held events such as a tribute for the first New Yorker who died in the war, as well as a commemoration of the war&#x27;s first anniversary. During the 1990s, the museum continued to host other events such as memorials, benefits, ceremonies, parties, and weddings. The museum&#x27;s flight deck was temporarily converted to a 3,300-seat stadium during the 1998 Goodwill Games, when it hosted boxing and wrestling bouts.

A series of professional boxing matches commenced at the museum in 2001, one of which resulted in the death of fighter Beethaeven Scottland. The museum&#x27;s flight deck was later used as a filming location for the 2004 movie &quot;National Treasure&quot; and the 2007 film &quot;I Am Legend&quot;. When the museum reopened in 2008, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; estimated that the carrier hosted 150 events annually, ranging &quot;from black-tie galas to bar mitzvahs, photos shoots and runway shows&quot;. It held concerts during the 2013 MLB All-Star Weekend and during Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014. In addition, the museum continued to host other events such as political fundraisers, film screenings, and social events like Astronomy Night. The museum&#x27;s operators have also rented out the flight deck and halls for weddings.

<doc id="632689" wikidata="Q7447995" url="?curid=632689" title="Self-Reliance">
<text>&quot;Self-Reliance&quot; is an 1841 essay written by American transcendentalist philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson. It contains the most thorough statement of one of his recurrent themes: the need for each person to avoid conformity and false consistency, and follow his or her own instincts and ideas. It is the source of one of his most famous quotations:
: &quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.&quot;
This essay is an analysis into the nature of the &quot;aboriginal self on which a universal reliance may be grounded&quot;. Emerson emphasizes the importance of individualism and its effect on a person&#x27;s satisfaction in life, explaining how life is &quot;learning and forgetting and learning again&quot;.

== History ==
The first hint of the philosophy that would become &quot;Self-Reliance&quot; was presented by Ralph Waldo Emerson as part of a sermon in September 1830 a month after his first marriage. His wife Ellen was sick with tuberculosis and, as Emerson&#x27;s biographer Robert D. Richardson wrote, &quot;Immortality had never been stronger or more desperately needed!&quot;

From 1836 into 1837, Emerson presented a series of lectures on the philosophy of history at Boston&#x27;s Masonic Temple. These lectures were never published separately, but many of his thoughts in these were later used in &quot;Self-Reliance&quot; and several other essays. Later lectures, such as &quot;The American Scholar&quot; and the Divinity School Address,
by Emerson led to public censure of his radical views, the staunch defense of individualism in &quot;Self-Reliance&quot; being a possible reaction to that censure.

&quot;Self-Reliance&quot; was first published in his 1841 collection, &quot;Essays: First Series.&quot;
Emerson helped start the beginning of the Transcendentalist movement in America. &quot;Self-Reliance&quot; is one of Emerson&#x27;s most famous essays. Emerson wrote on &quot;individualism, personal responsibility, and nonconformity.&quot;

Emerson had a very large background of religious affiliations. His father was a Unitarian minister; Emerson eventually followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps to become a minister as well. Emerson&#x27;s religious practices can be viewed as unconventional and his beliefs, non-traditional. Emerson understood that individuals are inexplicably different and ideas are constantly changing. He encouraged religious individuals to &quot;&#x27;breathe new life into the old forms of their religion.&quot;

The Transcendentalist movement flourished in New England and proposed a revolutionarily new philosophy of life. This new philosophy drew upon old ideas of Romanticism, Unitarianism, and German Idealism as well as the American republican tradition. Some of these ideas pertained closely to the values of America at the time. These values included nature, individualism, and reform, and can be noted in Emerson&#x27;s essay.

== Themes ==
Emerson&#x27;s themes include the authority of the individual, according to Anne Marie Hacht. Nothing has authority over the self, she says. One particular temptation is to find enlightenment in history but Emerson argues that it can only come from individual searching. He believes that truth is inside a person and this is an authority, not institutions like religion.

Emerson&#x27;s essay focuses and consistently relates back to one major theme: &quot;Trust thyself&quot;.

One of the most prevalent themes in the essay is nonconformity. Emerson states,
: &quot;Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist&quot;.

He counsels his readers to do what they think is right no matter what others think.

Haijing Liang, in her analysis of &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;, explains how Emerson &quot;encourages the readers to free themselves from the constraints of conformity and give themselves back to their nature&quot;.

Solitude and the community appear within the essay multiple times. Emerson wrote how the community is a distraction to self-growth, by friendly visits, and family needs. He advocates more time being spent reflecting on one&#x27;s self. This can also happen in the community through strong self-confidence. This would help the counseled to not sway from his beliefs in groups of people. Emerson mentions &quot;but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.&quot;

Spirituality, specifically the idea that truth is within one&#x27;s self, is a recurring theme in Emerson&#x27;s essay. Emerson posits that reliance upon institutionalized religion hinders the ability to grow mentally as an individual.

The theme of individualism is often proposed within &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;.
Emerson explains the ultimate form of happiness is achieved when a person learns and adapts an individualistic lifestyle based on their own values.
Emerson emphasizes, &quot;Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles.&quot;

The conflict between originality and imitation is often an oscillating theme in the essay. Emerson emphasizes that &quot;Envy is ignorance, imitation is suicide.&quot; Near the end, he encourages society: &quot;Insist on yourself; never imitate.&quot;

== Criticism ==
Herman Melville&#x27;s 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; has been read as a critique of Emerson&#x27;s philosophy of self-reliance, embodied particularly in the life and death of Ahab. Melville&#x27;s critique of self-reliance as a way of life is seen to lie in its destructive potential, especially when taken to extremes. Richard Chase writes that for Melville,
: &quot;Death – spiritual, emotional, physical – is the price of self-reliance when it is pushed to the point of solipsism, where the world has no existence apart from the all-sufficient self.&quot;

In that regard, Chase sees Melville&#x27;s art as antithetical to that of Emerson&#x27;s thought, in that Melville
: &quot;[points] up the dangers of an exaggerated self-regard, rather than, as ... Emerson loved to do, [suggested] the vital possibilities of the self.&quot;

Newton Arvin further suggests that self-reliance was, for Melville, really the
: &quot;[masquerade in kingly weeds of] a wild egoism, anarchic, irresponsible, and destructive.&quot;

Although never directly stated, Emerson&#x27;s &quot;Self-Reliance&quot; has religious influences tied into the values and beliefs presented. Critics argue that Emerson believes the Universe is not complete without &quot;The Spirit&quot;. Without some form of spirituality or religious tendencies, society and the universe &quot;is sad, hopeless, and largely meaningless.&quot;
In his work, the transcendentalist argues that no person, specifically individuals who are self-reliant, exists without a slight connection to a higher power. Mark Cladis, author of a published religious analysis of &quot;Self-Reliance&quot;, argues individuals are
: &quot;intimately connected to that which is greater than the self alone.&quot;

Emerson encourages his readers to understand that self-reliance is
: &quot;freedom in a spiritual universe that is just as rule-governed as the Newtonian physical universe&quot;.

Cladis explains that individuals are not expected to endure life alone; achieving self-reliance is understanding that
: &quot;we are surrounded by helps and aids of all kinds, supporting us, sustaining us, journeying always with us.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
Emerson&#x27;s quote, &quot;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds&quot;, is a running joke in the 1998 film &quot;Next Stop Wonderland&quot;. A single woman (portrayed by Hope Davis), who is familiar with the Emerson quote, goes on dates with several men, each of whom tries to impress her by referencing the line, but misquotes it and misattributes it to W.C. Fields, Karl Marx, or Cicero.

This quote is also referenced in one of the episodes of the television show &quot;The Mentalist&quot; when Patrick Jane meets a crime boss and they start a dialogue.
It was also stated in the 1989 film &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; in reference to a group of teenagers who regularly take a short cut through the backyard of an older couple, it is used as well in the 1972 comedy film &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;

Isaac Asimov, in author&#x27;s notes to his collection of mystery short stories, &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Mysteries&quot;, invokes the quote with the single word &quot;Emerson!&quot; whenever one story in the collection, set in a common universe, appears to contradict another. For instance, the story &quot;The Dying Night&quot; appears to contradict the background of &quot;The Singing Bell&quot;. Asimov relates how he was introduced to the quotation while reviewing proofs of an article with his co-authors.
