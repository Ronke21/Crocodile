<text>Chalk River Laboratories (; also known as CRL, Chalk River Labs and formerly Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories, CRNL) is a Canadian nuclear research facility in Deep River, about north-west of Ottawa.

CRL is a site of significant research and development to support and advance nuclear technology, particularly CANDU reactor technology. CRL has expertise in physics, metallurgy, chemistry, biology, and engineering and hosts unique research facilities. For example, Bertram Brockhouse, a professor at McMaster University, received the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics for his pioneering work in neutron spectroscopy while at CRL from 1950 to 1962. Sir John Cockcroft was an early director of CRL and also a Nobel laureate. Until the shutdown of its nuclear reactor in 2018, CRL produced a large share of the world&#x27;s supply of medical radioisotopes. It is owned by the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories subsidiary of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and operated under contract by the Canadian National Energy Alliance, a private-sector consortium led by AtkinsRéalis.

== History ==

In 1952, Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) was created by the government to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. AECL also took over the operation of Chalk River from the NRC. Since the 1950s, AECL has operated various nuclear research reactors to produce nuclear material for medical and scientific applications. At one point, the Chalk River Laboratories produced about one-third of the world&#x27;s medical isotopes and half of the North American supply. Despite the declaration of peaceful use, from 1955 to 1985, Chalk River facilities supplied about of plutonium, in the form of spent reactor fuel, to the U.S. Department of Energy to be used in the production of nuclear weapons. (The bomb dropped on Nagasaki, Japan, used about of plutonium.)

Canada&#x27;s first nuclear power plant, a partnership between AECL and Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, went online in 1962 near the site of Chalk River Laboratories. This reactor, Nuclear Power Demonstration (NPD), was a demonstration of the CANDU reactor design, one of the world&#x27;s safest and most successful nuclear reactors.

The Deep River neutron monitor operated once in Chalk river.

===1952 NRX incident===

Chalk River was also the site of two nuclear accidents in the 1950s. The first incident occurred on December 12, 1952, when there was a power excursion and partial loss of coolant in the NRX reactor, which resulted in significant damage to the core. The control rods could not be lowered into the core because of mechanical problems and human errors. Three rods did not reach their destination and were taken out again by accident. The fuel rods were overheated, resulting in a meltdown. Hydrogen explosions seriously damaged the reactor and the reactor building. The seal of the reactor vessel was blown up four feet, and of radioactive water were found in the cellar of the building. This water was dumped in ditches around from the border of the Ottawa River. During this accident, some of radioactive material was released. Future U.S. president Jimmy Carter, then a U.S. Navy officer in Schenectady, New York, was part of a team of 26 men, including 13 U.S. Navy volunteers, involved in the hazardous cleanup. 14 months later the reactor was in use again.

===1958 NRU incident===

The second accident, in 1958, involved a fuel rupture and fire in the National Research Universal reactor (NRU) reactor building. Some fuel rods were overheated. With a robotic crane, one of the rods with metallic uranium was pulled out of the reactor vessel. When the arm of the crane moved away from the vessel, the uranium caught fire, and the rod broke. The rod&#x27;s largest part fell into the containment vessel, still burning. The whole building was contaminated. The valves of the ventilation system were opened, and a large area outside the building was contaminated. The fire was extinguished by scientists and maintenance men in protective clothing running along the hole in the containment vessel with buckets of wet sand, throwing the sand down when they passed the smoking entrance.

Both accidents required a major cleanup effort involving many civilian and military personnel. Follow-up health monitoring of these workers has not revealed any adverse impacts from the two accidents. However, the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, an anti-nuclear watchdog group, notes that some cleanup workers who were part of the military contingent assigned to the NRU reactor building unsuccessfully applied for a military disability pension due to health damages.

=== 2007 shutdown ===
On November 18, 2007, the NRU, which made medical radioisotopes, was shut down for routine maintenance. This shutdown was extended when AECL, in consultation with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), decided to connect seismically-qualified emergency power supplies (EPS) to two of the reactor&#x27;s cooling pumps (in addition to the AC and DC backup power systems already in place), which had been required as part of its August 2006 operating licence issued by the CNSC. This resulted in a worldwide shortage of radioisotopes for medical treatments because Chalk River made the majority of the world&#x27;s supply of medical radioisotopes, including two-thirds of the world&#x27;s technetium-99m.

On December 11, 2007, the House of Commons of Canada, acting on independent expert advice, passed emergency legislation authorizing the restarting of the NRU reactor and its operation for 120 days (counter to the decision of the CNSC), which was passed by the Senate and received Royal Assent on December 12. Prime Minister Stephen Harper criticized the CNSC for this shutdown, which &quot;jeopardized the health and safety of tens of thousands of Canadians&quot;, insisting that there was no risk, contrary to the testimony of then-CNSC President &amp; CEO Linda Keen. She would later be fired for ignoring a decision by Parliament to restart the reactor, reflecting its policy that the safety of citizens requiring essential nuclear medicine should be taken into account in assessing the overall safety concerns of the reactor&#x27;s operation.
The NRU reactor was restarted on December 16, 2007.

===2008 radioactive leakage===
On December 5, 2008, heavy water containing tritium leaked from the NRU.

In its formal report to the CNSC, filed on December 9, 2008 (when the volume of leakage was determined to meet the requirement for such a report) AECL mentioned that of heavy water were released from the reactor, about 10% of which evaporated and the rest contained, but affirmed that the spill was not serious and did not present a threat to public health. The amount that evaporated to the atmosphere is considered to be minor, accounting for less than a thousandth of the regulatory limit.

In an unrelated incident, the same reactor had been leaking of light water per day from a crack in a weld of the reactor&#x27;s reflector system. This water was systematically collected, purified in an on-site Waste Treatment Centre, and eventually released to the Ottawa River in accordance with CNSC, Health Canada, and Ministry of the Environment regulations. Although the leakage was not a concern to the CNSC from a health, safety or environmental perspective, AECL made plans for a repair to reduce the current leakage rate for operational reasons.

===2009 NRU reactor shutdown===

In mid-May 2009, the heavy water leak at the base of the NRU reactor vessel, first detected in 2008 (see above), returned at a greater rate and prompted another temporary shutdown until August 2010. The lengthy shutdown was necessary to first completely defuel the entire reactor, then ascertain the full extent of the corrosion to the vessel, and finally to effect the repairsall with remote and restricted access from a minimum distance of due to the residual radioactivity in the reactor vessel. The 2009 shutdown occurred at a time when only one of the other four worldwide regular medical isotope sourcing reactors was producing, resulting in a worldwide shortage.

=== NRU shutdown in March 2018 ===
The NRU reactor licence expired in 2016. However, the licence was extended to March 31, 2018. The reactor was shut down for the last time at 7 p.m. on March 31, 2018, and has entered a &quot;state of storage&quot; before decommissioning operations which will continue for many years within the scope of future operating or decommissioning licences issued by the CNSC.

=== Modernization and decommissioning ===
The site remains in active use as of 2024. In 2016, 1.2 billion CAD was allotted over ten years to decommission 120 old buildings and build new ones. The new buildings were completed starting in 2020, as the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Research Facilities.

In May 2023, it was announced that the world&#x27;s first micro-modular reactor, from Global First Power (GFP), is to be built at Chalk River Laboratories and will be used to power the CNL campus as a demonstration unit. It is then expected that multiple microreactors, each the size of a shipping container, will be built at CNL and transported to remote northern communities where they will replace the existing diesel generator infrastructure, saving some 200 million litres of fuel.

<text>Mount Evelyn is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 37 km east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Mount Evelyn recorded a population of 9,799 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Mount Evelyn nestles in a right-angled bend of the Olinda Creek, a large, permanent creek known originally as Running Creek. Different parts of the current Mount Evelyn area were first known as Olinda Vale, Billygoat Hill, McKillop/Valinda and South Wandin.

The Post Office opened on 15 February 1904 as Valinda (derived from Olinda Vale). The name was changed to Evelyn (the name of the county) in 1908, then to Mount Evelyn in 1913. The town experienced a boom in the early 1930s due to the construction of the nearby Silvan Dam and Mount Evelyn Aqueduct, but was greatly affected by the depression of the same period once this project was completed in 1932.

The railway line was closed in 1965, just before the area experienced rapid population growth in the 1970s and 1980s. Together with the nearby settlements of Belgrave, Monbulk and other towns, the region developed a tourism industry that persists to this day. The town&#x27;s reserves were also incorporated into the larger Dandenong Ranges National Park in the southern part of the suburb. Biannually, the Mt Evelyn Township Group run the Mt Evelyn Street Party, a 1950s styled event with food, workshops, activities, live performers, competitions and a fashion parade. The next instalment will be held on Sunday 27 October 2021.

===Etymology===
The (now closed) railway station, opened in 1901, was originally named &#x27;Olinda Vale&#x27;. This was changed to &#x27;Evelyn&#x27; after the county in which it is centrally placed, possibly as part of an attempt by the Victorian Railways to shorten names of stations. In 1919, the local progress association persuaded the Railways to add the &quot;Mount&quot; to encourage visitors to the healthy mountain area, which is the highest point on the railway (now the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail).

Contrary to popular belief, the town was not named for the daughter of the Victorian Governor of the day. The origin of the name &#x27;Evelyn&#x27; remains a mystery.

==Education==
Mount Evelyn has five schools within its boundaries.
*Mount Evelyn Primary School
*St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Mt. Evelyn
*Birmingham Primary School
*Yarra Hills Secondary College Mount Evelyn Campus
*Mount Evelyn Christian School

==Parks and reserves==
The Warburton Trail, a walking and cycling track, runs through Mount Evelyn. The trail runs between Lilydale and Warburton.

The Mount Evelyn Aqueduct Walk is another trail connecting Swansea Road to Hunter Road and the Mount Evelyn Forest (part of the Dandenong Ranges National Park).

==Sport==
The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Outer East Football Netball League at Gary Martin Oval. The club was founded in 1931 as the Mount Evelyn Rovers.

<doc id="611051" wikidata="Q1190570" url="?curid=611051" title="Irish Citizen Army">
<text>The Irish Citizen Army (), or ICA, was a small paramilitary group of trained trade union volunteers from the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU) established in Dublin for the defence of workers&#x27; demonstrations from the Dublin Metropolitan Police. It was formed by James Larkin, James Connolly and Jack White on 23 November 1913. Other prominent members included Seán O&#x27;Casey, Constance Markievicz, Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, P. T. Daly and Kit Poole. In 1916, it took part in the Easter Rising, an armed insurrection aimed at ending British rule in Ireland.

Following the Easter Rising, the death of James Connolly and the departure of Jim Larkin, the ICA largely sidelined itself during the Irish War of Independence by choosing to only offer material support to the Irish Republican Army and not become directly involved itself. Following the ICA&#x27;s declaration in July 1919 that members could not be simultaneously members of both the ICA and the IRA, combined with the ICA&#x27;s military inactivity, there was a steady stream of desertion from the ICA. During the Irish Civil War, the ICA declared itself &quot;neutral&quot;, resulting in further departures from the organisation.

The ICA ceased to hold any military importance from 1920 until 1934 when the newly formed Republican Congress attempted to revive it. However, when the Republican Congress split and collapsed over ideological in-fighting, so too did the ICA.

==The Lockout of 1913==

The Citizen Army arose out of the great strike of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union (ITGWU) in 1913, known as the Lockout of 1913. The dispute was over the recognition of that labour union, founded by James Larkin. It began when William Martin Murphy, an industrialist, locked out some trade unionists on 19 August 1913. On 25 August, in response, Larkin called an all-out tramway strike on Murphy&#x27;s Dublin United Tramway Company. Other companies, encouraged by Murphy, sacked ITGWU members in an effort to break the union. The conflict eventually escalated to involve 400 employers and 25,000 workers. &quot;Larkinism&quot; prompted the recruitment of a workers&#x27; militia. However, Larkin was arrested by strikebreakers in October; James Connolly, his deputy, took control for the duration of the lockout, announcing a call to arms of four battalions of trained men with corporals and sergeants.

This strike caused most of Dublin to come to an economic standstill; it was marked by vicious rioting between the strikers and the Dublin Metropolitan Police, particularly at a rally on O&#x27;Connell Street on 31 August, in which two men were beaten to death and about 500 more injured. Another striker was later fatally wounded by a ricochet from a revolver fired by a strike-breaker. The violence at union rallies during the strike prompted Larkin to call for a workers&#x27; militia to be formed to protect themselves against the police. The Citizen Army for the duration of the lock-out was armed with hurleys (sticks used in hurling, a traditional Irish sport) and bats to protect workers&#x27; demonstrations from the police. Jack White, a former captain in the British Army, volunteered to train this army and offered £50 towards the cost of shoes to workers so that they could train. In addition to its role as a self-defence organisation, the Army, which was drilled in Croydon Park in Fairview by White, provided a diversion for workers unemployed and idle during the dispute. After a six-month standoff, the workers returned to work hungry and defeated in January 1914. The original purpose of the ICA was over, but it would soon be totally transformed.

==Re-organisation==

The Irish Citizen Army underwent a complete reorganisation in 1914. In March of that year, police attacked a demonstration of the Citizen Army and arrested Jack White, its commander. Seán O&#x27;Casey, the playwright, then suggested that the ICA needed a more formal organisation. He wrote a constitution, stating the Army&#x27;s principles as follows: &quot;the ownership of Ireland, moral and material, is vested of right in the people of Ireland&quot; and to &quot;sink all difference of birth property and creed under the common name of the Irish people&quot;.

Larkin insisted that all members also be members of a trade union, if eligible. In mid-1914, White resigned as ICA commander in order to join the mainstream nationalist Irish Volunteers, and Larkin assumed direct command.

The ICA armed itself with Mauser rifles, bought from Germany by the Irish Volunteers and smuggled into Ireland at Howth in July 1914. This organisation was one of the first to offer equal membership to both men and women, and trained them both in the use of weapons. The army&#x27;s headquarters was the ITGWU union building, Liberty Hall, and membership was almost entirely Dublin-based. However, Connolly also set up branches in Tralee and Killarney in County Kerry. Tom Clarke called a meeting of all the separatist groups in Dublin on 9 September 1914 to assist a German invasion of Ireland, and prevent the police disarming the Volunteers. An intellectual dispute broke out within the ranks of the ICA between Liam O&#x27;Briain and the ICA&#x27;s military commander, Michael Mallin, who thought that the former&#x27;s plan for an integrated movement was totally unrealistic. O&#x27;Brian wanted to pursue a strategy without the Dublin brigade being &quot;cooped up in the city&quot;. Mallin told him that, on the contrary, the whole strategy was to focus on the central objective on and around Dublin Castle. Little did they know that the Castle and the barracks behind possessed no more than a skeleton garrison, and could have been taken by a token force.

James Larkin left Ireland for America in October 1914, leaving the Citizen Army under the command of James Connolly. Whereas during the Lockout the ICA had been a workers&#x27; self-defence militia, Connolly conceived of it as a revolutionary organisation dedicated to the creation of an Irish socialist republic. He had served in the British Army in his youth, and knew something about military tactics and discipline.

Other active members in the early days included the Secretary to the council, Seán O&#x27;Casey, who tried to have Constance Markievicz expelled for her close associations with the Irish Volunteers. He described the formation of the nationalist force as &quot;one of the most effective blows&quot; that the ICA had received. Men who might have joined the ICA were now drilling—with the blessing of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB)—under a command that included employers who had stood with Murphy against those trying to &quot;assert the first principles of Trade Unionism&quot;. When in the late summer of 1914, it became apparent that Connolly was gravitating towards the IRB, O&#x27;Casey and Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, vice-president, resigned from the ICA.

In May 1914, Jack White had also withdrawn from ICA, replaced as chairman of the executive by Larkin, but it was to join Volunteers. Explaining that he had always &quot;to link the Labour and National Causes as soon as they can be linked&quot;, White, who had clashed with O&#x27;Casey, insisted that the nationalist militia was an allied force. It was a move for which later, as a socialist, he was to express regret. What White failed to appreciate, according ICA veteran and trade unionist, Frank Robbins, was that, despite the guiding presence of Connolly, the men he had drilled in Dublin, &quot;while trade unionists, were not by any measure socialists&quot;.

The ICA was grossly under-funded. John Devoy, the prominent Irish-American member of IRB Fenians, believed the existence of &quot;a land army on Irish soil&quot; was the most important sign since the founding of the Gaelic League. James Connolly, a convinced Marxist socialist and Irish Republican, believed that achieving political change through physical force, in the tradition of the Fenians, was legitimate. The ICA was the victim of small numbers, that shrank to only 200-300 persons, and fitful discipline.

In October 1915, armed ICA pickets patrolled a strike by dockers at Dublin port. Appalled by the participation of Irishmen in the First World War, which he regarded as an imperialist, capitalist conflict, Connolly began openly calling for insurrection in his newspaper, the &quot;Irish Worker&quot;. When this was banned he opened another, the &quot;Worker&#x27;s Republic&quot;.

British authorities tolerated the open drilling and bearing of arms by the ICA, thinking that to clamp down on the organisation would provoke further unrest. A small group of IRB conspirators within the Irish Volunteers movement had started planning a rising. Worried that Connolly would embark on premature military action with the ICA, they approached him and inducted him into the IRB&#x27;s Supreme Council to co-ordinate their preparations for the armed rebellion which became known as the Easter Rising.

==Easter Rising==
On Monday, 24 April 1916, 220 members of the ICA (including 28 women) took part in the Easter Rising, alongside a much larger body of the Irish Volunteers. They helped occupy the General Post Office (GPO) on O&#x27;Connell Street (then named Sackville Street), Dublin&#x27;s main thoroughfare. Michael Mallin, Connolly&#x27;s second-in-command, along with Kit Poole, Constance Markievicz and an ICA company, occupied St Stephen&#x27;s Green. Another company under Sean Connolly took over City Hall and attacked Dublin Castle. Finally, a detachment occupied Harcourt Street railway station. ICA men were the first rebel casualties of Easter week, two of them being killed in an abortive attack on Dublin Castle. The confusion in the chain of command caused conflict with the Volunteers. Harry Colley and Harry Boland came out from their outposts in the Wicklow Chemical Manure Company&#x27;s office 200 yards away, where they were under the command of an irascible officer, Vincent Poole; the post had been set up by James Connolly, without countermanding orders from affective Volunteers.

Sean Connolly, an ICA officer and Abbey Theatre actor, was both the first rebel to kill a British soldier and the first to be killed.

A total of eleven Citizen Army men were killed in action in the rising, five in the City Hall/Dublin castle area, five in St Stephen&#x27;s Green and one in the GPO.

James Connolly was made commander of the rebel forces in Dublin during the Rising and issued orders to surrender after a week. He and Mallin were executed by British Army firing squad some weeks later. The surviving ICA members were interned, in English prisons or at Frongoch internment camp in Wales, for between nine and 12 months.

==Inactivity during the War of Independence and Civil War==
===War of Independence===
Following the Easter Rising, the ICA had lost most of their most dynamic and militant leaders. James Connolly and Michael Mallin had been executed, while Jim Larkin was in America and later imprisoned in Sing Sing from 1920 until 1923. The ICA was largely left in the hands of James O&#x27;Neill. By the time of the Irish War of Independence, there were never more than 250 people actively involved in the ICA, and these were mostly concentrated in Dublin city. By this stage, the ICA could not nor would not engage directly British forces in Ireland; Instead the organisation chose to operate as a support organisation to the IRA, provide weapons, medical aid and other material support. On one occasion ICA members stewarding a proscribed Connolly commemoration fired on police, wounding four of them. While at first the ICA was content to allow members to both in the IRA and ICA, in July 1919 they declared members could only be in one or the other. This caused much resentment with the ICA&#x27;s own membership and resulted in a number of people choosing the IRA over the ICA.

In April 1919 the ICA choose to take no action in relation to the establishment of the Limerick Soviet, part of a wider wave of Irish soviets happening at the time. Internal frustrations with the ICA&#x27;s inactivity began to boil over: In January 1920 members began to argue over its relationship to Sinn Féin and the IRA. Member Michael Donnelly accused the ICA of now simply being a &quot;tail&quot; to Sinn Féin and suggested that supporting the IRA was &quot;illogical&quot; because the IRA was no longer fighting for the same Republic the ICA sought. In response, leading ICA member Dick MacCormack accused Donnelly of seeking to break up the ICA. Infighting continued to grow as the months progressed: Members criticised Countess Markievicz, still a standing member of the ICA, for speaking at Sinn Féin rallies. When Sean McLoughlin, a socialist who had fought in the Easter Rising, published a report to the Third International containing criticisms of the ICA, the ICA responded by putting out a &quot;warrant&quot; for his &quot;arrest&quot;. As 1920 continued, while the ICA continued to practice military drills, in practicality, it was beginning to operate more like a social club for members of Dublin&#x27;s labour and socialists cliques than a paramilitary organisation, with members noting that as much time was being given to playing cards together, classes on socialism, and the operating of a Pipeband as anything else.

===Civil War===
Following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, the ICA adopted a stance of &quot;neutrality&quot; between the pro and anti-treaty sides of now emerging Irish Civil War. In a view of a majority of the ICA, neither side was working towards a &quot;Workers&#x27; Republic&quot;, which was the ICA&#x27;s aim. Their views matched that of the mainstream labour movement such as the Labour Party, who campaigned for peace between both sides in the face of the civil war. However, what direction the ICA should move towards lead to ideological in-fighting, with different factions arguing in favour of following Jim Larkin, others supporting Roddy Connolly and his newly formed Communist Party of Ireland (a renamed version of his father&#x27;s Socialist Party of Ireland), while others wanted to keep the ICA in line with the mainstream Labour Party.

In the end, a majority choose to stand by the Labour Party and to campaign for peace between the Pro and Anti Treaty sides. This led to many defections from the ICA, with a majority joining the Anti-Treaty IRA while a minority joined the newly formed National Army of the Free State.

==Post Revolutionary Period==
In the 1920s and 1930s, the ICA was kept alive by veterans such as Seamus McGowan, Dick McCormack and Frank Purcell, though largely as an old comrades association by veterans of the Easter Rising. Uniformed Citizen Army men provided a guard of honour at Constance Markievicz&#x27;s funeral in 1927.

In 1929 Roddy Connolly and Helena Molony encouraged the formation of a &quot;Workers&#x27; Defence Corps&quot; that was to be a &quot;New ICA&quot;—an idea that British Intelligence was also associating with Jack White. However, this new group was to comprise both ICA veterans and the remnants of the anti-treaty IRA, who were still a much larger group than the ICA, and thus out of fear of being simply absorbed and annexed by the IRA, the ICA passed on the idea.

===Brief revival under the Republican Congress===
In 1934, spurred by events in Spain, Peadar O&#x27;Donnell and other left-wing republicans left the IRA and founded the Republican Congress. For a brief time, they revived the ICA as a paramilitary force, intended to be an armed wing for their new movement. According to Brian Hanley&#x27;s history of the IRA, the revived Citizen Army had 300 or so members around the country in 1935. Dynamic new figures such as Frank Ryan and Michael Price made the move into the ICA and helped give it new strength. The ICA and the Republican Congress came up with a new framework for revolution in Ireland, the need for a &quot;triple alliance&quot;. They believed the path to success lay in three forces united in the name of the workers: A paramilitary force (the ICA), A Socialist Party (The Republican Congress) and One Big Union (in this case, ITGWU).

However, the Congress itself split in September 1934, which led to a corresponding split in the ICA. One fraction, which had left the Congress, were led by Michael Price and Nora Connolly O&#x27;Brien, while the opposing faction led by O&#x27;Donnell and Roddy Connolly were loyal to those who stayed.

The ICA&#x27;s last public appearance was to accompany the funeral procession of union leader and ICA founding figure James Larkin in Dublin in 1947.

===Name used during the Troubles===
In December 1974 when the INLA was at its founding meeting in Dublin while deciding what to name the new paramilitary organization the name &quot;Irish Citizens Army&quot; had been suggested, this it was hoped would make the new group seem like the true inheritors of James Connolly&#x27;s legacy &amp; ideology, but it was ultimately passed on as a group had used the name to carry out several sectarian attacks in Belfast during the early 1970s.

==Uniforms and banners==
The ICA uniform was dark green with a slouched hat and badge in the shape of the Red Hand of Ulster. As many members could not afford a uniform, they wore a blue armband, with officers wearing red ones.

Their banner was the Starry Plough. James Connolly said the significance of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. The symbolism of the flag was evident in its earliest inception of a plough with a sword as its blade. Taking inspiration from the Bible, and following the internationalist aspect of socialism, it reflected the belief that war would be redundant with the rise of the Socialist International. This was flown by the ICA during the Rising of 1916. The design changed during the 1930s to that of the blue banner on the right, which was designed by members of the Republican Congress, and was adopted as the emblem of the Irish Labour movement, including the Irish Labour Party. It is also claimed by Irish republicans, and has been carried alongside the Irish tricolour and Irish provincial flags at Official IRA, Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), Irish People&#x27;s Liberation Organisation (IPLO) and Continuity IRA rallies and marches.

The banner, and alternative versions of it, is also used by Anti-Imperialist Action Ireland the Workers&#x27; Party, Republican Sinn Féin, Connolly Youth Movement, Labour Youth, Ógra Shinn Féin, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, the Republican Socialist Youth Movement and the Republican Socialist Collective (IPLO&#x27;s political wing).

<text> is a tiny asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Aten group moving in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth. Because of that, it is in a co-orbital configuration relative to Earth.

== Discovery, orbit and physical properties ==

 was discovered by the Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) system in orbit around the Sun on 20 December 2003. Its diameter is approximately 10 to 30 metres. The object is on NASA&#x27;s Earth Close Approach list, and is estimated to miss Earth by 0.01 AU. It revolves around the Sun on an Earth-like, almost circular, orbit. Its orbital period of 363.846 days also is very close to the sidereal year.

== Co-orbital with Earth and orbital evolution ==

From approximately 1997 to 2006, the asteroid remained within of Earth and it appeared to slowly orbit Earth. However, is no second moon, as it is not bound to Earth. It is the first discovered member of a postulated group of coorbital objects, or quasi-satellites, which show these path characteristics. Other members of this group include 10563 Izhdubar, 54509 YORP, , , and . Before 1996, the asteroid had been on a so-called horseshoe orbit around the Sun, along the Earth&#x27;s orbit. After 2006, it had regained such an orbit. This makes it very similar to , which will become a quasi-satellite of Earth in approximately 600 years.

<text>Crytek GmbH is a German video game developer and software developer based in Frankfurt. Founded by the Yerli brothers in Coburg in 1999 and moved to Frankfurt in 2006, Crytek operates additional studios in Kyiv, Ukraine and Istanbul, Turkey. Its former studios included Crytek Black Sea in Sofia, Bulgaria, Crytek UK in Nottingham, and Crytek USA in Austin, Texas. Crytek is best known for developing the first instalment of the &quot;Far Cry&quot; series, the &quot;Crysis&quot; series, and the open world nature of their games which showcase the company&#x27;s CryEngine. As of August 2024, Crytek is the largest game developer in Germany with 405 employees.

== History ==
=== 1999–2004: CryEngine and &quot;Far Cry&quot; ===

Crytek was founded by the Turkish-German brothers Cevat, Avni and Faruk Yerli in September 1999 in Coburg, Germany. One of their first projects was a tech demo of a game called &quot;X-Isle: Dinosaur Island&quot;, which showcased their game engine technology that offered larger viewing distances than other game engines could at that time. They met with Nvidia during the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) where their tech demo caught the attention of Nvidia and various media groups. Crytek later signed on with Nvidia to distribute &quot;X-Isle&quot; as benchmarking software for Nvidia cards.

Crytek&#x27;s first major game project was &quot;Engalus&quot;, a first-person shooter with a cyberpunk theme and role-playing elements, which was first privately shown at E3 2000. The project first attracted publicity for the company at the 2000 ECTS with their tech demo at the Nvidia booth, but was subsequently cancelled. Crytek was approached by Ubisoft to develop &quot;X-Isle&quot; into a full AAA game. This evolved into &quot;Far Cry&quot;, which was released in March 2004. Concurrently, Crytek announced their licensable game engine, CryEngine, that was used for &quot;X-Isle&quot; and &quot;Far Cry&quot;.

In February 2004, German police carried out a morning raid on Crytek offices, acting on an ex-intern&#x27;s claim that Crytek was using software illegally. The police investigated for software copies greater than licences purchased, but no charges were pressed. That same month, Crytek and Electronic Arts (EA) announced a strategic partnership to develop a new gaming franchise based on the CryEngine, which would eventually be the &quot;Crysis&quot; series. Crytek chose this path to highlight that the CryEngine was not limited to just what &quot;Far Cry&quot; had shown. Due to this partnership, Ubisoft acquired the full rights to the &quot;Far Cry&quot; franchise by 2006 as well as a perpetual licence to the first CryEngine, which they have since adapted into their own Dunia Engine. In December 2004, Crytek and ATI created a special cinematic machinima to demonstrate the future of PC gaming.

=== 2004–2014: Company expansion, CryEngine 2 and 3, and later games ===
In January 2006, Crytek announced the development of &quot;Crysis&quot;, promising that it would be an original first-person shooter with a new kind of gameplay challenge requiring &quot;adaptive tactics&quot;. The game later won several Best PC Game awards from E3 and Games Convention. In April 2006, Crytek moved to new offices in Frankfurt. The first public demonstration of Crytek&#x27;s CryEngine 2 was in January 2007, one year after &quot;Crysis&quot; was announced. It has been licensed by many companies such as Avatar Reality, WeMade Entertainment, Entropia Universe, XLGames, Reloaded Studios.

On 11 May 2006, Crytek announced that their satellite studio in Kyiv, Ukraine, had been upgraded to a full development studio, giving the company its second development studio. About a week after the upgrade of the Kyiv studio, Crytek announced a new studio in Budapest, Hungary.

&quot;Crysis&quot; was released in November 2007. In September 2008, an expansion to &quot;Crysis&quot; entitled &quot;Crysis Warhead&quot; was released as a PC-exclusive game. In October 2011, &quot;Crysis&quot; was released on some consoles, allowing play of the original game via Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network.

On 14 July 2008, Crytek bought Black Sea Studios and renamed it to Crytek Black Sea. On 17 November 2008, Crytek opened an office in South Korea named Crytek, Ltd. On 3 February 2009, Crytek purchased Free Radical Design, a British video game company known for the &quot;TimeSplitters&quot; series, and renamed the company to Crytek UK.

In March 2009, Crytek announced on the company&#x27;s website that it would introduce CryEngine 3 at the 2009 Game Developers Conference. This new engine was developed for use on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PCs. In October 2009, CryEngine 3 became available in trade flow for game developers. In March 2010, CryEngine 3 was made compatible with stereoscopic 3D technology. Crytek released &quot;Crysis 2&quot;, a direct sequel to the original game, in March 2011.

At E3 2011, Crytek exhibited several new projects, including the action game &quot;&quot;. In September 2011, THQ and Crytek announced a partnership to develop &quot;Homefront 2&quot;. After THQ filed for bankruptcy, Crytek acquired the &quot;Homefront&quot; franchise from THQ entirely in January 2013. In February 2012, Crytek announced a new cloud based social gaming network called Gface. The service is designed to help users meet people and play multiplayer video games with friends. Crytek began researching a cloud gaming system in 2005 for &quot;Crysis&quot;, but paused development in 2007.

In April 2012, Crytek released the CryEngine 3.4 SDK which brought full DirectX 11 support to the CryEngine SDK. Crytek released &quot;Crysis 3&quot; in February 2013 and &quot;Ryse: Son of Rome&quot; in November 2013 as an Xbox One launch title. The PC version of &quot;Ryse&quot; was released in October 2014.

On 17 January 2013, Crytek officially opened an office in Istanbul, Turkey. On 28 January 2013, Crytek opened a new studio, Crytek USA, in Austin, Texas, consisting primarily of former Vigil Games employees.

=== Since 2014: Restructuring, new leadership, CryEngine V, and latest games ===
In June 2014, reports surfaced that Crytek had missed wage payments and withheld bonuses for Crytek UK and Crytek USA employees, and the company responded that it was in a &quot;transitional phase&quot; as it secured capital for future projects, with a particular emphasis on online gaming. In July 2014, Crytek announced a strategic deal where the rights to &quot;Homefront&quot; including &quot;&quot; and the Crytek UK staff were transferred to Koch Media. The team continued its work on the game as the new Deep Silver Dambuster Studios. Crytek USA was restructured to remain an engine support team while development of &quot;&quot; was transferred to Crytek.

On 20 December 2016, Crytek announced that their studios in Hungary, Bulgaria, South Korea and China would be shut down. On 7 March 2017, Crytek sold Crytek Black Sea to Sega and The Creative Assembly. On 28 February 2018, Crytek announced that Cevat Yerli was stepping down as chief executive officer (CEO) of Crytek, with his brothers, Avni and Faruk Yerli, taking over the company&#x27;s leadership as joint CEOs. Cevat continues to support the company as an advisor and major shareholder. Crytek announced the next iteration of the engine branded CRYENGINE V on 22 March 2016.

Crytek released &quot;&quot; (utilising the fifth generation of the CryEngine) in 2019–20. The company has also worked on three virtual reality projects, namely &quot;The Climb&quot; for the Oculus Rift, &quot;The Climb 2&quot; for the Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest 2, and &quot;&quot; for the PlayStation VR, Oculus Rift and SteamVR. &quot;Arena of Fate&quot; was cancelled after Crytek&#x27;s restructuring which saw the game&#x27;s developer Crytek Black Sea sold.

In July 2021, German tabloid BILD reported that the Chinese Internet company Tencent was attempting to buy Crytek for over €300 million via a European subsidiary.

In 2021, the Creative Services team responsible for creating trailers, won a Gold MUSE Award for The Dark Sight Trailer that promoted .

On 26 January 2022 Crytek announced the fourth entry of the Crysis franchise, but the game was put on hold in 2025 followed by another round of layoffs.

<doc id="611059" wikidata="Q5553423" url="?curid=611059" title="Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.">
<text>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323 (1974), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court establishing the standard of First Amendment protection against defamation claims brought by private individuals. The Court held that, so long as they do not impose liability without fault, states are free to establish their own standards of liability for defamatory statements made about private individuals. However, the Court also ruled that if the state standard is lower than actual malice, the standard applying to public figures, then only actual damages may be awarded.

The consequence is that strict liability for defamation is unconstitutional in the United States; the plaintiff must be able to show that the defendant acted negligently or with an even higher level of mens rea. In many other common law countries, strict liability for defamation is still the rule.

==Background of the case==
In 1968, a Chicago police officer, Richard Nuccio, shot and killed Ronald Nelson. After the officer was convicted of second-degree murder, Nelson&#x27;s family retained a lawyer, Elmer Gertz, to represent them in civil litigation against the officer.

A year later, &quot;American Opinion&quot;, a publication of the John Birch Society, ran a series of articles falsely alleging the existence of a Communist conspiracy to discredit local police agencies and thus facilitate their replacement by a national police force that could more effectively implement the dictatorship they planned to impose on the country. One of those touched on the Nuccio case, claiming that the officer had been framed at his criminal trial and making strong allegations about Gertz. It claimed that he had orchestrated Nuccio&#x27;s conviction and that he was a member of various communist front organizations. It further implied that he had a lengthy criminal record himself and used various anti-communist terms of abuse (&quot;Leninist&quot;, &quot;Communist-fronter&quot;) to describe him.

==Lower court proceedings==
Gertz filed suit in federal court against Robert Welch, Inc. (the John Birch Society&#x27;s legal name), claiming its article had defamed and injured his reputation as a lawyer. The John Birch Society moved for summary judgment, arguing that Gertz was a public figure under the recently enunciated &quot;Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts&quot; standard, which applied the &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot; standard to anyone who was sufficiently public, not just government officials. Thus, it was argued, their statements about him were specially privileged and the plaintiff would have to demonstrate actual malice. However, the magazine&#x27;s editor admitted in an affidavit filed with the motion that he had made no independent effort to verify the claims in the article and had simply relied on the author&#x27;s reputation and previous work.

The court denied the motion, suggesting that Gertz would need to prove only negligence. At the summing up, however, the court determined that he was neither a public figure nor a public official, and instructed the jury to consider only damages, including punitive damages. Gertz was awarded $50,000.

However the defendants filed a &quot;motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or in the alternative for a new trial &quot; which Judge Decker allowed on the grounds that closer reading of the law persuaded him that &quot;Times&quot; applied insofar as it brought &quot;matters of public interest&quot; into the scope of requiring &quot;actual malice&quot; (knowledge of untruth or reckless disregard for the truth). Decker opined (in a memorandum opinion) that Gertz had failed to show actual malice. (Gertz remarks in his book, that since he had been specifically instructed that there was no need to show actual malice, he expected, at this point in the opinion, a new trial to be ordered.) Decker granted the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, saying that the law compelled it.

Gertz appealed to contest the applicability of the &quot;New York Times&quot; standard to this case. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the trial court&#x27;s verdict.

==The Court&#x27;s decision==
The Supreme Court decided the case in a 5-4 majority opinion delivered by Lewis Franklin Powell Jr., with a separate concurrence by Harry Blackmun. All four dissenting justices filed separate opinions.

===Majority opinion===
After reviewing the case history and prior decisions, Powell began with a reminder that &quot;Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea ... (it) requires that we protect some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters.&quot;

However, he rejected the idea that the mere public interest of the subject should outweigh any consideration of Gertz&#x27;s status as a private or public figure. The latter, he noted, have access to more ways of counteracting allegations about them than private figures do, and thus they deserved a higher standard to prove libel. He also highly doubted that one could involuntarily become a public figure.

Gertz &quot;had achieved no general fame or notoriety in the community,&quot; despite some public service in his past, and therefore did not meet the &quot;Sullivan&quot; or &quot;Curtis&quot; tests. &quot;He plainly did not thrust himself into the vortex of this public issue, nor did he engage the public&#x27;s attention in an attempt to influence its outcome.&quot;

&quot;For these reasons, we conclude that the States should retain substantial latitude in their efforts to enforce a legal remedy for defamatory falsehood injurious to the reputation of a private individual,&quot; Powell said.

However, in the one aspect of the decision that was favorable to the appellees, the Court also ruled that states could not impose a strict liability standard for defamation (i.e., plaintiffs had to be able to show fault of some kind) and that juries could not be allowed to award punitive damages, such as the $50,000 Gertz had received, absent any showing of actual malice, since juries could use that power to punish unpopular opinions. A new trial was ordered.

Blackmun&#x27;s short concurrence praised his brethren for clarifying an issue he had felt was left undecided in &quot;Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc.&quot;, one of the earlier defamation cases. He also scoffed at fears expressed by dissenters that the press was now too unconstrained: &quot;What the Court has done, I believe, will have little, if any, practical effect on the functioning of responsible journalism.&quot;

===Dissenting opinions===
The minority chose a variety of grounds for its disagreement. In the longest, Byron White accused his colleagues of overreaching, a common theme of his dissents. &quot;The Court, in a few printed pages, has federalized major aspects of libel law by declaring unconstitutional in important respects the prevailing defamation law in all or most of the 50 States,&quot; he said. &quot;There are wholly insufficient grounds for scuttling the libel laws of the States in such wholesale fashion, to say nothing of deprecating the reputation interest of ordinary citizens and rendering them powerless to protect themselves... It is an ill-considered exercise of the power entrusted to this Court.&quot;

William O. Douglas, on the other hand, felt that libel laws were too strict even as it was, and that leaving liability standards for private figures up to the states was too capricious:

:This of course leaves the simple negligence standard as an option with the jury free to impose damages upon a finding that the publisher failed to act as &quot;a reasonable man.&quot; With such continued erosion of First Amendment protection, I fear that it may well be the reasonable man who refrains from speaking.

William Brennan joined him in fearing that the press in some states could be too easily restricted and practice self-censorship in reporting on public affairs as a result. Warren Burger&#x27;s short dissent worried that the decision might make it less likely that lawyers would be willing to take the cases of unpopular clients.

==Disposition==
Gertz won the retrial at District Court, which awarded him $400,000 (including $300,000 in punitive damages). The verdict was sustained on appeal, and the case finally ended when the Supreme Court denied the John Birch Society &quot;certiorari&quot; in 1983. Gertz, a prominent civil libertarian, said that the jury verdict had not only vindicated him &quot;but struck a blow for responsible journalism.&quot;

==Subsequent jurisprudence==
Since the majority opinion emphatically stated that there was &quot;no such thing as a false idea,&quot; observers and libel law experts expected the court to define an opinion privilege against libel the next time an appropriate case came up. It took sixteen years, and they were surprised and disappointed by &quot;Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.&quot;, which explicitly rejected the idea, saying that existing protections it had recognized were sufficient to meet the requirements of the First Amendment. Only in New York, where state courts have ruled all statements of opinion are protected as long as they do not allege illegal conduct, does the privilege exist.

<text>Sarah Porter (August 16, 1813 – February 18, 1900) was the American educator who founded Miss Porter&#x27;s School, a private college preparatory school for girls.

==Biography==

She was born in Farmington, Connecticut, to Rev. Noah Porter (1781 – 1866) and his wife, Mehetable &quot;Meigs&quot; Porter (1786 – 1874). Her older brother, Noah Porter, was President of Yale College from 1871 to 1886.

She was educated at Farmington Academy and at the Young Ladies Institute in New Haven, and, uncharacteristically for women of the time, studied privately with Yale College professors. She taught in Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania, and returned to Connecticut in 1843 to found a female counterpart to Simeon Hart&#x27;s Academy for Boys. Initially, she had only 25 students, but because of the school&#x27;s expansive curriculum, including the sciences as well as the humanities, the daughters of the affluent soon made it their school of choice, and the school quickly expanded. She encouraged students to pursue academic excellence and exercise. She was an opponent of women&#x27;s suffrage but promoted other legal reforms for women, including reforms in divorce and property laws.

Prominent students of the Porter School include Alice Hamilton, Edith Hamilton, architect Theodate Pope Riddle, Gloria Vanderbilt, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Graciela Arango.

<doc id="611065" wikidata="Q739445" url="?curid=611065" title="Popemobile">
<text>The popemobile is a specially designed motor vehicle used by the Pope during public appearances. It is considered a successor to the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot; and was designed to allow the Pope to be more visible when greeting large crowds. 

There have been many different designs for popemobiles; some are open air, while others have bulletproof glass walls to enclose the Pope, deemed necessary after the 1981 assassination attempt of Pope John Paul II. Some allow the Pope to sit, while others are designed to accommodate him standing. The variety of popemobiles allows the Roman Curia to select an appropriate one for each usage depending upon the level of security needed, distance, speed of travel, and the Pope&#x27;s preferences.

The vehicle registration plates of Vatican City all begin with the letters &quot;SCV&quot;, an abbreviation of the Latin (&quot;Vatican City State&quot;), followed by the vehicle fleet number. The registration plate for the Ford Focus currently used by Pope Francis is &quot;SCV 00919&quot;. In the past, the popemobile has typically used registration plate &quot;SCV 1&quot;, although plates numbered &quot;SCV 2&quot; to &quot;SCV 9&quot; have also been used. Mercedes-Benz is acknowledged to have been the most frequent provider of papal vehicles since it provided the Vatican with its first &quot;popemobile&quot; in 1930. In December 2024, the Vatican would get its first electric popemobile, with plans also being made to make the rest of the popemobiles electric by 2030 as well.

==History==

For public appearances, before the invention of the popemobile concept, the Pope used the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot;, a chair carried on the shoulders of papal attendants. This fell out of use after the death of Pope Paul VI in 1978. Pope John Paul I, who succeeded Pope Paul VI and reigned for only 33 days before his death, was the last Pope who used the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot;.

Papal carriages were adorned with red velvet upholstery and gilded engravings and trimmings. Several were used in the 1800s, many of which have been restored and are on display at the Carriage Pavilion exhibit of the Vatican Museums.

An inventory from the papal stables in 1841 shows the carriages were pulled by horses with names such as Bandito (Bandit), Pomposino (Pompous), Bufalino (Buffalo) and Capitano (Captain).

On 10 November 1929, the Vatican would get its first automobile when the Graham brothers who led the Detroit based Graham Paige Motors Corporation donated a &quot;Graham Paige 837&quot; limousine, which Pope Pius XI would use to travel to the Basilica of St. John Lateran on 22 December 1929. However, the Nurburg 460 Pullman which was given to Pope Pius XI in 1930 by German car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz is considered to have been to first &quot;official&quot; popemobile. 

The term &quot;popemobile&quot; was first used in English-language media to refer to a custom-built Lincoln Continental used by Pope Paul VI during a pastoral visit to New York City in 1965. After the visit, the car was sold to Fort Dodge, Iowa eye doctor Eric Swanson, who promoted it as the &quot;Pope-Mobile&quot; and loaned it for other uses, including ticker-tape parades for the Apollo astronauts.

===Usage by John Paul II===

The first time that John Paul II traveled to his home country in 1979, he was transported in the white vehicle based on the Polish Star 660 truck from a firm FSC Star. For John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Ireland in 1979, Ford Ireland donated a D series truck which was adapted by OBAM coachbuilders; in 2017 it was available for private rental in Dublin. It was bigger than the truck used later in Vatican City. Another popemobile was a modified Mercedes-Benz with a small windowed enclosure in the back where the Pope sits. A converted 230 G Mercedes-Benz G-Class was built for John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Germany in 1980.

Following the attempted assassination of John Paul II in 1981, the popemobile was fitted with bulletproof glass. British Leyland supplied both Leyland T45 lorry-based and Range Rover SUV-based armored popemobiles in 1982 for the pope&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom. One of the two T45-based vehicles used was sold at auction in 2006 for 37,000 GBP, the other is kept in the British Commercial Vehicle Museum in Leyland, UK. One of the Range Rovers is exhibited at the National Museum of Funeral History (Houston, Texas). The Pope used a popemobile derived from the SEAT Panda model during his visit to Spain in 1982; this specific car was open-air with a grab handle in front so that the Pope could stand still and greet the crowds while moving. The Pope entered the Camp Nou football stadium in Barcelona, driving through the assembled crowds celebrating Mass for a congregation of over 121,000 on 17 November 1982.During the Pope&#x27;s visit to Canada in 1984, a modified GMC Sierra was used as a base, rebuilt by the Thibault Fire Engines Company in Pierreville, Quebec. It was subsequently used for the 1998 papal visit to Cuba and was displayed at the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa in 2005. The second truck built by the Thibault Fire Engines Company was sent back to the Vatican in 1984.

During the papal visit to the United States in September 1987, a pair of Mercedes-Benz 230 G popemobiles were flown to Washington, D.C., and modified by the United States Secret Service to provide access to the papal compartment from the driver&#x27;s cabin, a design that continued to be used after the trip. One of these vehicles has been retired and is currently on display at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.

In 2002, John Paul II requested that the media stop referring to the car as the &quot;popemobile&quot;, saying that the term was &quot;undignified&quot;. The popemobile most often used by Pope Benedict XVI when traveling abroad was a modified Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility vehicle with a special glass-enclosed room that had its own oxygen supply built into the back of the vehicle. The Pope enters through a rear door and ascends several steps. He then sits in a chair made from white leather with gold trim which is then elevated into the glass room by a hydraulic lift, allowing the Pope to be more easily seen. In addition to the driver, there is room for one passenger (usually a security agent) in the front of the vehicle. The glass-enclosed rear of the vehicle also has room for two papal aides who can sit in the area in front of the Pope&#x27;s elevated chair. The vehicle includes bulletproof glass windows and skylights and is made from reinforced armour plating, security features designed to withstand explosives under or around it. At 2011 prices, the popemobile cost approximately £345,000.

On June 6, 2007, a German man tried to jump into Benedict XVI&#x27;s uncovered popemobile as the pontiff began his general audience. The Pope was not hurt and did not even appear to notice that the man had jumped over the protective barrier in the square and had grabbed onto the white Fiat popemobile as it passed. At least eight security officers were trailing the vehicle as it moved slowly through the square. They subsequently grabbed the man and wrestled him to the ground, before he was interrogated by Vatican police.

===Usage by Francis===

Pope Francis shows a preference for a simpler lifestyle and simpler cars. As a cardinal, he often used public transport. On the night of his election, he rode with the other cardinals in a minibus back to their hotel instead of using a papal limousine. For trips within the Vatican City, he uses a small Ford Focus from the Vatican motor pool. He also drives himself around the city in a 1984 Renault 4 presented to him by Italian Father Renzo Zocca.

A Kia Soul was used as the Popemobile in August 2014 when he visited South Korea.

Italian automaker Fiat, the traditional supplier of papal cars, supplied Pope Francis with the Fiat 500L used for his visit to the United States on 22–27 September 2015. Fiat also supplied the Jeep Wrangler he used in Ecuador in July 2015.

During his visit in the Philippines, the Popemobile&#x27;s model was an Isuzu D-Max. In 2019, Pope Francis received a Dacia Duster to be used as the popemobile during his visit to Romania. For his 2024 visit in Indonesia, the popemobile used is based on Pindad Maung MV3 Tangguh. He used a Hyundai Ioniq 5 during his visit to Singapore.

In December 2024, Pope Francis received the Vatican&#x27;s first ever all-electric popemobile with an all-electric Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen.

<text>A point mutation is a genetic mutation where a single nucleotide base is changed, inserted or deleted from a DNA or RNA sequence of an organism&#x27;s genome. Point mutations have a variety of effects on the downstream protein product—consequences that are moderately predictable based upon the specifics of the mutation. These consequences can range from no effect (e.g. synonymous mutations) to deleterious effects (e.g. frameshift mutations), with regard to protein production, composition, and function.

==Causes==
Point mutations usually take place during DNA replication. DNA replication occurs when one double-stranded DNA molecule creates two single strands of DNA, each of which is a template for the creation of the complementary strand. A single point mutation can change the whole DNA sequence. Changing one purine or pyrimidine may change the amino acid that the nucleotides code for.

Point mutations may arise from spontaneous mutations that occur during DNA replication. The rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from UV rays, X-rays or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention.

There are multiple ways for point mutations to occur. First, ultraviolet (UV) light and higher-frequency light have ionizing capability, which in turn can affect DNA. Reactive oxygen molecules with free radicals, which are a byproduct of cellular metabolism, can also be very harmful to DNA. These reactants can lead to both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA breaks. Third, bonds in DNA eventually degrade, which creates another problem to keep the integrity of DNA to a high standard. There can also be replication errors that lead to substitution, insertion, or deletion mutations.

==Categorization==
===Transition/transversion categorization===

In 1959 Ernst Freese coined the terms &quot;transitions&quot; or &quot;transversions&quot; to categorize different types of point mutations. Transitions are replacement of a purine base with another purine or replacement of a pyrimidine with another pyrimidine. Transversions are replacement of a purine with a pyrimidine or vice versa. There is a systematic difference in mutation rates for transitions (Alpha) and transversions (Beta). Transition mutations are about ten times more common than transversions.

===Functional categorization===
Nonsense mutations include stop-gain and start-loss. Stop-gain is a mutation that results in a premature termination codon (&quot;a stop was gained&quot;), which signals the end of translation. This interruption causes the protein to be abnormally shortened. The number of amino acids lost mediates the impact on the protein&#x27;s functionality and whether it will function whatsoever. Stop-loss is a mutation in the original termination codon (&quot;a stop was lost&quot;), resulting in abnormal extension of a protein&#x27;s carboxyl terminus. Start-gain creates an AUG start codon upstream of the original start site. If the new AUG is near the original start site, in-frame within the processed transcript and downstream to a ribosomal binding site, it can be used to initiate translation. The likely effect is additional amino acids added to the amino terminus of the original protein. Frame-shift mutations are also possible in start-gain mutations, but typically do not affect translation of the original protein. Start-loss is a point mutation in a transcript&#x27;s AUG start codon, resulting in the reduction or elimination of protein production.

Missense mutations code for a different amino acid. A missense mutation changes a codon so that a different protein is created, a non-synonymous change. Conservative mutations result in an amino acid change. However, the properties of the amino acid remain the same (e.g., hydrophobic, hydrophilic, etc.). At times, a change to one amino acid in the protein is not detrimental to the organism as a whole. Most proteins can withstand one or two point mutations before their function changes. Non-conservative mutations result in an amino acid change that has different properties than the wild type. The protein may lose its function, which can result in a disease in the organism. For example, sickle-cell disease is caused by a single point mutation (a missense mutation) in the beta-hemoglobin gene that converts a GAG codon into GUG, which encodes the amino acid valine rather than glutamic acid. The protein may also exhibit a &quot;gain of function&quot; or become activated, such is the case with the mutation changing a valine to glutamic acid in the BRAF gene; this leads to an activation of the RAF protein which causes unlimited proliferative signalling in cancer cells. These are both examples of a non-conservative (missense) mutation.

Silent mutations code for the same amino acid (a &quot;synonymous substitution&quot;). A silent mutation does not affect the functioning of the protein. A single nucleotide can change, but the new codon specifies the same amino acid, resulting in an unmutated protein. This type of change is called synonymous change since the old and new codon code for the same amino acid. This is possible because 64 codons specify only 20 amino acids. Different codons can lead to differential protein expression levels, however.

===Single base pair insertions and deletions===
Sometimes the term &quot;point mutation&quot; is used to describe insertions or deletions of a single base pair (which has more of an adverse effect on the synthesized protein due to the nucleotides&#x27; still being read in triplets, but in different frames: a mutation called a frameshift mutation).

==General consequences==
Point mutations that occur in non-coding sequences are most often without consequences, although there are exceptions. If the mutated base pair is in the promoter sequence of a gene, then the expression of the gene may change. Also, if the mutation occurs in the splicing site of an intron, then this may interfere with correct splicing of the transcribed pre-mRNA.

By altering just one amino acid, the entire peptide may change, thereby changing the entire protein. The new protein is called a protein variant. If the original protein functions in cellular reproduction then this single point mutation can change the entire process of cellular reproduction for this organism.

Point germline mutations can lead to beneficial as well as harmful traits or diseases. This leads to adaptations based on the environment where the organism lives. An advantageous mutation can create an advantage for that organism and lead to the trait&#x27;s being passed down from generation to generation, improving and benefiting the entire population. The scientific theory of evolution is greatly dependent on point mutations in cells. The theory explains the diversity and history of living organisms on Earth. In relation to point mutations, it states that beneficial mutations allow the organism to thrive and reproduce, thereby passing its positively affected mutated genes on to the next generation. On the other hand, harmful mutations cause the organism to die or be less likely to reproduce in a phenomenon known as natural selection.

There are different short-term and long-term effects that can arise from mutations. Smaller ones would be a halting of the cell cycle at numerous points. This means that a codon coding for the amino acid glycine may be changed to a stop codon, causing the proteins that should have been produced to be deformed and unable to complete their intended tasks. Because the mutations can affect the DNA and thus the chromatin, it can prohibit mitosis from occurring due to the lack of a complete chromosome. Problems can also arise during the processes of transcription and replication of DNA. These all prohibit the cell from reproduction and thus lead to the death of the cell. Long-term effects can be a permanent changing of a chromosome, which can lead to a mutation. These mutations can be either beneficial or detrimental. Cancer is an example of how they can be detrimental.

Other effects of point mutations, or single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA, depend on the location of the mutation within the gene. For example, if the mutation occurs in the region of the gene responsible for coding, the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein may be altered, causing a change in the function, protein localization, stability of the protein or protein complex. Many methods have been proposed to predict the effects of missense mutations on proteins. Machine learning algorithms train their models to distinguish known disease-associated from neutral mutations whereas other methods do not explicitly train their models but almost all methods exploit the evolutionary conservation assuming that changes at conserved positions tend to be more deleterious. While majority of methods provide a binary classification of effects of mutations into damaging and benign, a new level of annotation is needed to offer an explanation of why and how these mutations damage proteins.

Moreover, if the mutation occurs in the region of the gene where transcriptional machinery binds to the protein, the mutation can affect the binding of the transcription factors because the short nucleotide sequences recognized by the transcription factors will be altered. Mutations in this region can affect rate of efficiency of gene transcription, which in turn can alter levels of mRNA and, thus, protein levels in general.

Point mutations can have several effects on the behavior and reproduction of a protein depending on where the mutation occurs in the amino acid sequence of the protein. If the mutation occurs in the region of the gene that is responsible for coding for the protein, the amino acid may be altered. This slight change in the sequence of amino acids can cause a change in the function, activation of the protein meaning how it binds with a given enzyme, where the protein will be located within the cell, or the amount of free energy stored within the protein.

If the mutation occurs in the region of the gene where transcriptional machinery binds to the protein, the mutation can affect the way in which transcription factors bind to the protein. The mechanisms of transcription bind to a protein through recognition of short nucleotide sequences. A mutation in this region may alter these sequences and, thus, change the way the transcription factors bind to the protein. Mutations in this region can affect the efficiency of gene transcription, which controls both the levels of mRNA and overall protein levels.

==Specific diseases caused by point mutations==
===Cancer===
Point mutations in multiple tumor suppressor proteins cause cancer. For instance, point mutations in Adenomatous Polyposis Coli promote tumorigenesis. A novel assay, Fast parallel proteolysis (FASTpp), might help swift screening of specific stability defects in individual cancer patients.

===Neurofibromatosis===

Neurofibromatosis is caused by point mutations in the Neurofibromin 1 or Neurofibromin 2 gene.

===Sickle-cell anemia===
Sickle-cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the β-globin chain of hemoglobin, causing the hydrophilic amino acid glutamic acid to be replaced with the hydrophobic amino acid valine at the sixth position.

The β-globin gene is found on the short arm of chromosome 11. The association of two wild-type α-globin subunits with two mutant β-globin subunits forms hemoglobin S (HbS). Under low-oxygen conditions (being at high altitude, for example), the absence of a polar amino acid at position six of the β-globin chain promotes the non-covalent polymerisation (aggregation) of hemoglobin, which distorts red blood cells into a sickle shape and decreases their elasticity.

Hemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells, and is responsible for the transportation of oxygen through the body. There are two subunits that make up the hemoglobin protein: beta-globins and alpha-globins.
Beta-hemoglobin is created from the genetic information on the HBB, or &quot;hemoglobin, beta&quot; gene found on chromosome 11p15.5. A single point mutation in this polypeptide chain, which is 147 amino acids long, results in the disease known as Sickle Cell Anemia.
Sickle-cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects 1 in 500 African Americans, and is one of the most common blood disorders in the United States. The single replacement of the sixth amino acid in the beta-globin, glutamic acid, with valine results in deformed red blood cells. These sickle-shaped cells cannot carry nearly as much oxygen as normal red blood cells and they get caught more easily in the capillaries, cutting off blood supply to vital organs. The single nucleotide change in the beta-globin means that even the smallest of exertions on the part of the carrier results in severe pain and even heart attack. Below is a chart depicting the first thirteen amino acids in the normal and abnormal sickle cell polypeptide chain.



===Tay–Sachs disease===
The cause of Tay–Sachs disease is a genetic defect that is passed from parent to child. This genetic defect is located in the HEXA gene, which is found on chromosome 15.

The HEXA gene makes part of an enzyme called beta-hexosaminidase A, which plays a critical role in the nervous system. This enzyme helps break down a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in nerve cells.
Mutations in the HEXA gene disrupt the activity of beta-hexosaminidase A, preventing the breakdown of the fatty substances. As a result, the fatty substances accumulate to deadly levels in the brain and spinal cord. The buildup of GM2 ganglioside causes progressive damage to the nerve cells. This is the cause of the signs and symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease.

==Repeat-induced point mutation==
In molecular biology, repeat-induced point mutation or RIP is a process by which DNA accumulates G:C to A:T transition mutations. Genomic evidence indicates that RIP occurs or has occurred in a variety of fungi while experimental evidence indicates that RIP is active in &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, &quot;Podospora anserina&quot;, &quot;Magnaporthe grisea&quot;, &quot;Leptosphaeria maculans&quot;, &quot;Gibberella zeae&quot; and &quot;Nectria haematococca&quot;. In &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, sequences mutated by RIP are often methylated &quot;de novo&quot;.

RIP occurs during the sexual stage in haploid nuclei after fertilization but prior to meiotic DNA replication. In &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, repeat sequences of at least 400 base pairs in length are vulnerable to RIP. Repeats with as low as 80% nucleotide identity may also be subject to RIP. Though the exact mechanism of repeat recognition and mutagenesis are poorly understood, RIP results in repeated sequences undergoing multiple transition mutations.

The RIP mutations do not seem to be limited to repeated sequences. Indeed, for example, in the phytopathogenic fungus &quot;L. maculans&quot;, RIP mutations are found in single copy regions, adjacent to the repeated elements. These regions are either non-coding regions or genes encoding small secreted proteins including avirulence genes.
The degree of RIP within these single copy regions was proportional to their proximity to repetitive elements.

Rep and Kistler have speculated that the presence of highly repetitive regions containing transposons, may promote mutation of resident effector genes. So the presence of effector genes within such regions is suggested to promote their adaptation and diversification when exposed to strong selection pressure.

As RIP mutation is traditionally observed to be restricted to repetitive regions and not single copy regions, Fudal &quot;et al.&quot; suggested that leakage of RIP mutation might occur within a relatively short distance of a RIP-affected repeat. Indeed, this has been reported in &quot;N. crassa&quot; whereby leakage of RIP was detected in single copy sequences at least 930 bp from the boundary of neighbouring duplicated sequences.
To elucidate the mechanism of detection of repeated sequences leading to RIP may allow to understand how the flanking sequences may also be affected.

===Mechanism===

RIP causes G:C to A:T transition mutations within repeats, however, the mechanism that detects the repeated sequences is unknown. RID is the only known protein essential for RIP. It is a DNA methyltransferease-like protein, that when mutated or knocked out results in loss of RIP. Deletion of the &quot;rid&quot; homolog in &quot;Aspergillus nidulans&quot;, &quot;dmtA&quot;, results in loss of fertility while deletion of the &quot;rid&quot; homolog in &quot;Ascobolus immersens&quot;, &quot;masc1&quot;, results in fertility defects and loss of methylation induced premeiotically (MIP).

===Consequences===

RIP is believed to have evolved as a defense mechanism against transposable elements, which resemble parasites by invading and multiplying within the genome.
RIP creates multiple missense and nonsense mutations in the coding sequence. This hypermutation of G-C to A-T in repetitive sequences eliminates functional gene products of the sequence (if there were any to begin with). In addition, many of the C-bearing nucleotides become methylated, thus decreasing transcription.

===Use in molecular biology===

Because RIP is so efficient at detecting and mutating repeats, fungal biologists often use it as a tool for mutagenesis. A second copy of a single-copy gene is first transformed into the genome. The fungus must then mate and go through its sexual cycle to activate the RIP machinery. Many different mutations within the duplicated gene are obtained from even a single fertilization event so that inactivated alleles, usually due to nonsense mutations, as well as alleles containing missense mutations can be obtained.

==History==

The cellular reproduction process of meiosis was discovered by Oscar Hertwig in 1876. Mitosis was discovered several years later in 1882 by Walther Flemming.

Hertwig studied sea urchins, and noticed that each egg contained one nucleus prior to fertilization and two nuclei after. This discovery proved that one spermatozoon could fertilize an egg, and therefore proved the process of meiosis. Hermann Fol continued Hertwig&#x27;s research by testing the effects of injecting several spermatozoa into an egg, and found that the process did not work with more than one spermatozoon.

Flemming began his research of cell division starting in 1868. The study of cells was an increasingly popular topic in this time period. By 1873, Schneider had already begun to describe the steps of cell division. Flemming furthered this description in 1874 and 1875 as he explained the steps in more detail. He also argued with Schneider&#x27;s findings that the nucleus separated into rod-like structures by suggesting that the nucleus actually separated into threads that in turn separated. Flemming concluded that cells replicate through cell division, to be more specific mitosis.

Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl are credited with the discovery of DNA replication. Watson and Crick acknowledged that the structure of DNA did indicate that there is some form of replicating process. However, there was not a lot of research done on this aspect of DNA until after Watson and Crick. People considered all possible methods of determining the replication process of DNA, but none were successful until Meselson and Stahl. Meselson and Stahl introduced a heavy isotope into some DNA and traced its distribution. Through this experiment, Meselson and Stahl were able to prove that DNA reproduces semi-conservatively.

<text>Emagic was a music software and hardware company based in Rellingen, Germany and a satellite office in Grass Valley, California. On July 1, 2002 Emagic was bought by Apple Computer. Emagic&#x27;s Windows-based product offerings were discontinued on September 30, 2002.

==History==
The company was best known for its music sequencer, Logic. Logic stemmed from Creator, then Notator, made by C-Lab (the company&#x27;s forerunner) for the Atari ST platform. In 1992, Emagic Soft- und Hardware GmbH was founded and Notator Logic was launched for Atari and Macintosh, followed by a version for Windows. The &quot;Notator&quot; was dropped from the name and the product was redesigned from the ground up, and the product became known under the name &quot;Emagic Logic&quot;. Original copies of Emagic&#x27;s Logic software retailed for , and with plugins ranging from $99 to $299. 

The other major software product that Emagic offered was SoundDiver, an editor/librarian for hardware synthesizers. It communicated via MIDI and offered easy patch and sound management. While there was a beta version for Mac OS X, production of SoundDiver was discontinued in 2005.

Emagic formerly offered a line of audio interface hardware, the Audiowerk PCI cards, as well as USB units. A potential post-acquisition successor to these products, the unreleased Asteroid FireWire interface, was the subject of the &quot;Apple v. Does&quot; trade secret litigation.

=== Acquisition by Apple ===
Emagic was acquired by Apple in July 2002. The announcement included the news that development of the Windows version would no longer continue, rendering Logic 5.5.1 as the final version available for Windows. This announcement caused controversy in the recording industry with an estimated 70,000 users having invested in the Windows route not wishing to reinvest in a complete new system. Despite much speculation in various Pro Audio forums however, exactly how many users may have abandoned Logic upon its acquisition by Apple, or abandoned the Windows platform for the Mac version, remains unknown, but Apple Pro Apps revenue has steadily increased since Apple&#x27;s acquisition of Emagic, (roughly $2 billion a year as of Q1 2014).

Logic 6 was released in February 2003, serving as the first major release of Logic following Apple&#x27;s acquisition of Emagic. The following year, it released Logic Pro 6, which replaced Logic Platinum and consolidated over 20 different Emagic products, including all instrument and effect plug-ins, Waveburner Pro (CD Authoring application), and Pro Tools TDM support, into a single product package. Apple also released a scaled down version of Logic called Logic Express, replacing Logic Silver and Logic Gold. 

Logic Pro 7 was released on September 29, 2004, the first version of Logic to be released under the Apple brand, with technical support being provided through AppleCare+ instead of Emagic. As Emagic&#x27;s products had been transferred to its parent company, it discontinued all of its older products, but continued to provide technical support until late 2005. Emagic became defunct on June 12, 2006.

<text>The Bedlington Terrier is a breed of small dog named after the mining town of Bedlington, Northumberland in North East England. Originally bred to hunt, the Bedlington Terrier has since been used in dog racing, numerous dog sports, as well as in conformation shows and as a companion dog. It is closely related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, Whippet and Otterhound.

It is described as a very versatile yet contradictory dog. They have powerful swimming skills, comparable to those of water dogs such as the Newfoundland, and are noted for being very quick and having high endurance. They love snow, and can achieve a Husky-like turn of speed on ice or in deep powder, using their powerful noses as a plough. Bedlingtons are noted for their similarity in appearance to lambs. The dogs have blue, liver or sandy colouration, all three of which may have tan points. Their fur forms a distinctive top knot on the dog&#x27;s head. It is nonshedding and with minimal odor but needs weekly grooming to remove dead hair.

Originally known as the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier, the name &quot;Bedlington Terrier&quot; was not applied to the breed until 1825, but some dogs have pedigrees that can be traced back as far as 1782. The first dog show with a class for Bedlington Terriers was held in 1870 at Bedlington. Bedlington Terriers shown at early shows were frequently dyed to improve the look of their fur. In 1948, a Bedlington Terrier known as Rock Ridge Night Rocket won best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The breed has a high incidence of copper toxicosis.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The Bedlington Terrier has been described as resembling a lamb. It has also been compared to a miniature version of the Scottish Deerhound. George Shields stated that exceedingly well-bred dogs possess the spirit of a thoroughbred racehorse.

The dogs have blue, liver or sandy colouration, all three of which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry what is known as the greying gene, a dominant trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog&#x27;s head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog&#x27;s topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.

The dog&#x27;s coat has been described as shaggy, hard, and rugged in style and it has also been described as linty in texture, giving the breed the nickname of &quot;linty-haired terrier&quot;. Its coat is made up of a combination of hard and soft hairs. It is extremely difficult to maintain a &quot;show clip&quot;, even for professionals, and grooming can be quite expensive. Dogs in what is referred to as &quot;show clip&quot;, or groomed for the show ring, cannot have fur that stands out more than from their body, and the coat must have a &quot;crisp&quot; texture. If grooming is not performed regularly, the coat&#x27;s condition rapidly deteriorates. For that reason, most Bedlingtons that are kept strictly as pets keep a lower maintenance &quot;pet groom&quot; style. Bedlington Terriers —like Poodles— have been referred to as a nonshedding, hypoallergenic breed. They have minimal dog odor as long as their coat and ears are healthy and their coat is groomed regularly to remove dead hair. Bedlingtons like the groomer and are cooperative under clip.

The head of the dog must be rounded in shape with no stop. Their eyes are almond-shaped and small, and the lips are close-fitting and lack flews. The back must be arched, and the body should be slightly longer in length than in height. Although is the preferred height for male dogs, a range from is allowed; for females, the preferred height is and the acceptable range is from . Both genders must weigh between . They possess a light, springy gait.

===Temperament===
Bedlingtons are sharp and . Their bark has been called hound-like and has been compared to the firing of a machine gun. A fast dog with high endurance, the Bedlington Terrier is just as quick in water as it is on land, and their swimming speed rivals that of the Newfoundland. Bedlington Terriers &quot;have pace enough to keep up with the ordinary speed of a horse.&quot; Because of the Whippet in their lineage, they have a tendency to bolt. Their versatility has been praised, with some dogs willing to &quot;[be] a house-dog, a gun-dog, a rat-dog, a badger-dog, or, if needed, [to] bolt a fox...&quot;

They are also known for their intelligence and tenacity when it comes to taking on vermin. Bedlingtons are quite fond of fighting, and are prone to jealousy when around other dogs. One man stated that &quot;this dog was about fit to kill any other dog of his weight&quot;. They have also been used in dog fighting.

However, both the AKC and the ASPCA call the breed &quot;mild&quot; and &quot;gentle&quot; and recommends it as being good with children. PetFinder says the breed is soft in temperament, companionable, demonstrative, loyal, and a quiet house dog. Although the breed may chase small animals outside, it is accepting of them inside. Playful and cheerful, the breed can be high-strung and excitable, and is prone to being headstrong. The New Zealand Kennel Club warns against keeping them with dogs that have dominant personalities, &quot;as once challenged they are terrifying fighters, despite their gentle appearance&quot;, but otherwise the breed is good with other dogs.

Some breeders, notably George Newcombe, have argued that the working ability and courage of the Bedlington terrier has declined since it began being bred for show. Poodle may have been introduced into the breed to make the coat easier to groom and maintain. George Newcombe of the Working Bedlington Terrier Club said that &quot;the pure [Bedlington Terrier] could no longer be considered a serious working breed&quot; and proceeded to cross his dogs with Lakeland Terriers in an attempt to bring back the Bedlington&#x27;s working qualities; the names Lakebed and Bedland have been proposed for the cross.

==History==

Bred in the village of Bedlington in Northumberland, the Bedlington Terrier has been described as &quot;the favourite companion of the northern miners&quot;. They were originally known as Rodbury Terriers, Rothbury Terriers, or &quot;Rothbury&#x27;s Lambs&quot;, because the Lord of Rothbury had taken a particular liking to the dogs. Before this, they were known as &quot;gypsy dogs&quot;, as the Romani people—called &#x27;Gypsies&#x27; in those days—and poachers used them to hunt. The first mention of the Bedlington terrier, or as it was then known, the Rothbury or Rodbury Terrier, was in 1825, most likely in &quot;The Life of James Allen&quot;, but some dogs&#x27; pedigrees have been traced as far back as 1782. James&#x27; father, William, was much in demand as an otter hunter, and he kept Bedlington Terriers in order to help him hunt. They were also valued by their owners as rabbit coursing dogs and racing dogs, until the Whippet became more popular as a racing dog and a courser.

The Bedlington Terrier name was first given to a dog named Young Piper, which was owned by a man named Joseph Ainsley. Ainsley&#x27;s Piper has been called &quot;the best of his race&quot; and &quot;had a reputation for great pluck and courage&quot;. Piper began working with badgers at eight months old, and carried on hunting other animals generally regarded as vermin until he was blind. Piper is also known for saving a child from a pig, keeping the animal at bay until help arrived. Piper died at fifteen.

A Bedlington&#x27;s plucky nature was also often its downfall. Many a dog was killed or put down after hunting badgers. A good hunting dog knew to keep its distance from the badger until the huntsmen arrived. Younger or inexperienced terriers would attack the badger, usually with horrific consequences. Limb amputations or lower jaws ripped off by the more powerful badger were common.

The first shows that had a class for the Bedlington Terrier were held in 1870 at Bedlington. The following year there was a Bedlington Terrier class at a show held at Crystal Palace, where a red dog named Miner took first prize. Miner also won a show held in Birmingham. The Bedlington Terrier Club was established in 1875. Many dogs in early shows were clipped and dyed to bring them closer to the breed standard and improve their chances of winning.

It is unknown if the judges of the time were aware of this practice, or if they cared. The practice of trimming was eventually accepted by The Kennel Club under the pretense that the trimming was being done to &quot;smarten a dog to show his shape and general contour.&quot;

Bedlington Terriers are closely related to the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. In fact the Earl of Antrim once exhibited two terriers from the same litter, and one won shows as a Dandie Dinmont, while the other won shows as a Bedlington. Bedlington Terriers are also related to the Kerry Blue Terrier and the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. The shape of its back suggests that it may be related to the Whippet and it may also be related to the otterhound. Bedlington Terriers have been crossed with Whippets to produce a Lurcher with &quot;extra guts, pep, [and] fire.&quot;

In 1948 Ch. Rock Ridge Night Rocket took best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show and was subsequently featured in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. One of his descendants, Ch. Femars&#x27; Cable Car, was featured on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in the February 8, 1960 edition.

==Health==

===Longevity===
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.7 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

Leading causes of death among Bedlington Terriers in a 2004 UK survey were old age (23%), urologic (15%) and hepatic (12.5%). The leading hepatic cause of death was copper toxicosis. Dogs that died of liver diseases usually died at a younger age than dogs dying of most other causes.

Bedlington Terrier owners in the UK reported that the most common health issues among living dogs were reproductive, heart murmur and eye problems such as epiphora, retinal dysplasia and cataracts. Bedlingtons seem to be more prone to these eye diseases than other breeds. They also have a high incidence of kidney problems. Copper toxicosis occurred among about 5% of living dogs. Inbreeding is a concern, since some dogs &quot;[having] been bred in and into a damaging extent.&quot; Reputable breeders will conduct DNA testing of all litters and will not allow pups that carry the copper toxicosis gene to be bred, a practice that has significantly reduced the incidence of this disease in the breed. Excepting these problems, Bedlingtons are generally a very healthy breed.

===Copper toxicosis===

Copper toxicosis, also known as copper storage disease and copper overload syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It is closely related to Wilson&#x27;s disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed.

Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the &quot;asymptomatic form&quot; occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the &quot;fulminating form&quot; which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the &quot;chronic form&quot;, which is characterized by an extended period of time in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.

== In art ==
Bedlington terriers feature in the paintings of Craigie Aitchison, particularly his crucifixions.

In the 2022 film &quot;Sisu&quot;, a Bedlington terrier was the faithful companion of the protagonist, a Finnish miner and prospector.

<text>Shakuntala Devi (4 November 1929 – 21 April 2013) was an Indian mental calculator, astrologer, and writer, popularly known as the &quot;Human Computer&quot;. Her talent earned her a place in the 1982 edition of &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. However, the certificate for the record was given posthumously on 30 July 2020, despite Devi achieving her world record on 18 June 1980 at Imperial College, London. Devi was a child, and she demonstrated her arithmetic abilities at the University of Mysore without any formal education.

Devi strove to simplify numerical calculations for students. She wrote several books in her later years, including novels as well as texts about mathematics, puzzles, and astrology. She wrote the book &quot;The World of Homosexuals&quot;, which is considered the first study of homosexuality in India. She saw homosexuality in a positive light and is considered a pioneer in the field.

== Early life ==
Shakuntala Devi was born on 4 November 1929 at Bangalore, Karnataka. to a Kannada Brahmin family. Her father, C V Sundararaja Rao, worked as a trapeze artist, lion tamer, tightrope walker and magician in a circus. He discovered his daughter&#x27;s ability to memorise numbers while teaching her a card trick when she was about three years old. Her father left the circus and took her on road shows that displayed her ability at calculation. She did this without any formal education. At the age of six she demonstrated her arithmetic abilities at the University of Mysore.

In 1944, Devi moved to London, United Kingdom.

== Mental calculator ==
Devi travelled to several countries around the world, demonstrating her arithmetic talents. She was on a tour of Europe throughout 1950 and was in New York City in 1976. In 1988, she travelled to the US to have her abilities studied by Arthur Jensen, a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen tested her performance at several tasks, including calculating large numbers. Examples of the problems presented to Devi included calculating the cube root of 61,629,875 and the seventh root of 170,859,375. Jensen reported that Devi provided the solution to the above-mentioned problems (395 and 15, respectively) before Jensen could copy them down in his notebook. Jensen published his findings in the academic journal &quot;Intelligence&quot; in 1990.

In 1977, at Southern Methodist University, she computed the 23rd root of a 201-digit number in 50 seconds. Her answer, 546,372,891, was confirmed by calculations done at the US Bureau of Standards using the UNIVAC 1101 computer, for which a special program had to be written to perform such a large calculation. It took the UNIVAC computer 62 seconds to produce the correct answer.

On 18 June 1980, she demonstrated the multiplication of two 13-digit numbers – 7,686,369,774,870 × 2,465,099,745,779. The Department of Computing at Imperial College London randomly picked these numbers. She correctly answered 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730 in 28 seconds. This event was recorded in the 1982 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. Writer Steven Smith commented, &quot;the result is so far superior to anything previously reported that it can only be described as unbelievable.&quot;

Shakuntala Devi explained many of the methods she used to do mental calculations in her 1977 book &quot;Figuring: The Joy of Numbers&quot;.

== Book on homosexuality ==
In 1977, she wrote &quot;The World of Homosexuals&quot;, the first published academic study of homosexuality in India, for which she was criticised. In the documentary &quot;For Straights Only&quot;, she said that her interest in the topic was because of her marriage to a homosexual man and her desire to look at homosexuality more closely to understand it.

The book, considered &quot;pioneering&quot;, features interviews with two young Indian homosexual men, a male couple in Canada seeking legal marriage, a temple priest who explains his views on homosexuality, and a review of the existing literature on homosexuality. It ends with a call for decriminalisation of homosexuality, and &quot;full and complete acceptance—not tolerance and sympathy&quot;. The book, however, went mostly unnoticed at that time.

== Personal life ==
Devi returned to India in the mid-1960s, and she married Paritosh Banerji, an officer of the Indian Administrative Service from Kolkata. They divorced in 1979, after her husband&#x27;s homosexuality was allegedly revealed. Their daughter Anupama Banerji claimed that Devi lied about her husband being gay to promote her book on homosexuals because her credibility on the subject matter was questioned.

In 1980, she contested the Lok Sabha elections as an independent candidate for Mumbai South and for Medak in Andhra Pradesh (now in Telangana). In Medak she stood against the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, saying she wanted to &quot;defend the people of Medak from being fooled by Mrs. Gandhi&quot;; she came ninth, with 6,514 votes (1.47% of the votes). Devi returned to Bangalore in the early 1980s.

In addition to her work as a mental calculator, Devi was a notable astrologer and an author of several books, including cookbooks and novels. She started with writing short stories and murder mysteries, and had a keen interest in music.

== Death and legacy ==
In April 2013, Devi was admitted to a hospital in Bangalore with severe respiratory problems. Over the following two weeks, she had heart and kidney complications. She died in the hospital on 21 April 2013. She was 83 years old. Her daughter Anupama Banerji is married to Ajay Abhaya Kumar, with whom she has two daughters, and lives in London.

On 4 November 2013, Devi was honoured with a Google Doodle on what would have been her 84th birthday.

A film on her life titled &quot;Shakuntala Devi&quot; was announced in May 2019. The film stars Vidya Balan in the lead title role and features Sanya Malhotra, Amit Sadh, and Jisshu Sengupta in the supporting roles. Produced by Sony Pictures Networks Productions, the film streamed worldwide on Amazon Prime Video on 31 July 2020.

<doc id="611093" wikidata="Q38533" url="?curid=611093" title="English Cocker Spaniel">
<text>The English Cocker Spaniel is a breed of gun dog. It is noteworthy for producing one of the most varied numbers of pups in a litter among all dog breeds. The English Cocker Spaniel is an active, good-natured, sporting dog standing well up at the withers and compactly built. There are &quot;field&quot; or &quot;working&quot; cockers and &quot;house&quot; cockers. It is one of several varieties of spaniel and is the foundation of its American cousin, the American Cocker Spaniel. The English Cocker is closer to the working-dog form of the Field Spaniel and the English Springer Spaniel. English Cocker Spaniels are also known as the &quot;Merry Spaniel&quot; due to their constantly wagging tail.

Outside the US, the breed is usually known simply as the Cocker Spaniel, as is the American Cocker Spaniel within the US. The OED states that the word &quot;cocker&quot; is derived from the fact the breed was used to flush woodcocks.
== History ==
Spaniel type dogs have been found in art and literature for almost 500 years. Initially, spaniels in England were divided among land spaniels and water spaniels. The differentiation among the spaniels that led to the breeds that we see today did not begin until the mid-19th century. During this time, the land spaniels became a bit more specialised and divisions among the types were made based upon weight. According to the 1840 Encyclopedia of Rural Sports, Cockers were 12–20 lb (5.5–9 kg). At this time it was not uncommon for Cockers and Springers to come from the same litter. Even a puppy from a &quot;Toy&quot; sized lineage could grow to be a springer.

There is no indication from these early sources that spaniels were used to retrieve games. Rather they were used to drive the game toward the guns.

During the 1850s and 1860s, other types of Cockers were recorded. There were Welsh Springer Spaniels and Devonshire Cockers. Additionally, small dogs from Sussex Spaniel litters were called Cockers. In 1874 the first stud books were published by the newly formed kennel club. Any spaniel under 25 lb (11 kg) was placed in the Cocker breeding pool, however, the Welsh Cocker was reclassified as a Springer in 1903 due to its larger size and shorter ear. &quot;...in those days only those dogs up to a hard day&#x27;s work and sensible specimens were allowed to live, as absolute sporting purposes were about their only enjoyment and dog shows were hardly heard of...&quot;.

The sport of conformation showing began in earnest among spaniels after the Spaniel Club was formed in 1885. When showing, the new &quot;Springer&quot; and &quot;Cocker&quot;, both were in the same class until The Spaniel Club created breed standards for each of the types. The Kennel Club separated the two types eight years later. Since then, the Springer and Cocker enthusiasts have bred in the separate traits that they desired. Today, the breed differs in more ways than weight alone.

At Crufts, the English Cocker Spaniel has been the most successful breed in winning Best in Show, winning on a total of seven occasions between 1928 and 2009, with wins in 1930, 1931, 1938, 1939, 1948, 1950 and 1996. In addition, the breed makes up three of the four winners who have won the title on more than one occasion with all three coming from H. S. Lloyd&#x27;s Ware kennel. Due to World War II, the English Cocker Spaniel managed to be the only breed to have won the title between 1938 and 1950, although the competition was only held on four occasions during that period. The most recent best in show was Sh. Ch. Canigou Cambrai in 1996.
=== Field Spaniel ===
In the late 19th century with the increase in popularity of dog shows and the creation of standards for various breeds, the Spaniel family began to split into various different breeds. A group of enthusiasts decided to create a large black spaniel breed. Four dogs would act as progenitors for this new breed, of which two were Cocker Spaniels, one was a Cocker Spaniel/English Water Spaniel cross and one was a Norfolk Spaniel. This new breed was named the Field Spaniel, and was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1892.

=== American Cocker Spaniel ===

The American Cocker Spaniel was developed from the English Cocker Spaniel in the 19th century to retrieve quails and woodcocks. They were originally divided from the English Cocker solely on a size basis but were bred over the years for different specific traits. The two Cocker Spaniels were shown together in America until 1936, when the English Cocker received status as a separate breed. The American Kennel Club granted a separate breed designation for the English Cocker Spaniel in 1946. The American breed has a shorter snout and is groomed differently from the English Cocker.

== Description ==
The English Cocker Spaniel is a sturdy, compact and well-balanced dog. It has a characteristic expression showing intelligence and alertness. Its eyes should be dark and its lobular ears should reach &quot;a bit past&quot; the tip of the nose when pulled forward. Today, a significant difference in appearance exists between field-bred and conformation show-bred dogs. The Cocker&#x27;s tail is customarily docked in North America. In countries where docking is legal, the tail is generally docked at about 4–5 inches (10–13 cm) in field-bred dogs while show dogs are generally docked closer to the body. Docking is now illegal in Australia and South Africa. In England and Wales, docking can only be carried out on dogs where the owners have proved that the dogs will be used as working or shooting dogs.

The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are on average between at the withers with the females a little smaller, growing to between . Both males and females of the breed weigh approximately . American Cocker Spaniels are smaller, with males being on average between and females again being smaller on average at between , both weighing approximately .

The English Cocker Spaniel is similar to the English Springer Spaniel and at first glance, the only major difference is the larger size of the Springer. However, English Cockers also tend to have longer, and lower-set ears than English Springers. In addition Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle, their eyes are not as prominent and the coat is less abundant.

=== Colour ===

The breed standard of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Kennel Club states that in solid colours, no white is allowed except for a small amount on the chest and the American Kennel Club has standards for features including the expression, neck, topline, and body. In working Cockers, breeders value working ability over the colour of the dog.

Solid English Cocker colours can come in black, liver/brown, red/golden with black or brown pigmentation and Parti-coloured cockers come in blue roan, liver roan, orange roan with black or brown pigmentation, lemon roan with black or brown pigmentation, black and white ticked, liver and white ticked, orange and white ticked with black or brown pigmentation, lemon and white ticked with black or brown pigmentation, black and white, liver and white with brown pigmentation, orange and white with black or brown pigmentation, lemon and white with black or brown pigmentation. All of these colours can also have Tan-points.

Of the solid colours, sable is considered rare and controversial and is classified by some countries as being a type of parti-colour on account of its mixed hair shafts. While some have claimed this colour is from a cross with a different breed, geneticists have discovered English Cocker sable is unique to this breed. In addition, a silver/ash colour, usually associated with the Weimaraner dog, is considered genetically possible but is yet to be recorded by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Kennel Club. Of the roan varieties, lemon roan with a light brown pigmentation is the most recessive of all the roans. Plain white Cockers are rarely born and not encouraged in the breed.

== Temperament ==
The English Cocker Spaniel ranks 18th in Stanley Coren&#x27;s &quot;The Intelligence of Dogs&quot;, being of excellent working/obedience intelligence.

With a good level of socialisation at an early age, Cocker Spaniels can get along well with people, children, other dogs and other pets. This breed seems to have a perpetually wagging tail and prefers to be around people; it is not best suited to the backyard alone. Cockers can be easily stressed by loud noises and by rough treatment or handling. When trained with a soft hand and plentiful rewards, the Cocker Spaniel will be an obedient and loving companion with a happy, cheerful nature.

== Health ==

A 2022 UK study of veterinary clinic data found a life expectancy of 11.31 years slightly above the 11.21 overall average but below the 11.82 average for crossbreeds. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 13.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 13 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall.

A 1996 study made by the University of Cambridge surveying 932 English Cocker Spaniel households throughout Britain found owners to report higher aggression in different coloured English Cocker Spaniels depending on the scenario. A 2009 study by Spanish researchers at the Autonomous University of Barcelona the study found that English Cocker Spaniels were more frequently produced to a referral clinic for aggression and that they had more impulsive attacks than other dogs. However, the notion of &#x27;cocker rage&#x27; has been dismissed as a myth.

A review of 2,318 English Cocker Spainels attending veterinary care found the most common conditions to be: periodontal disease with 20.97% prevalence, otitis externa with 10.09% prevalence, obesity with 9.88% prevalence, anal sac impaction with 8.07% prevalence, diarrhoea with 4.87% prevalence, and aggression with 4.01% prevalence.

The English Cocker Spaniel is predisposed to chronic hepatitis, with one study finding the breed to be 2.78 times more likely to acquire the disease.

The English Cocker Spaniel is one of the more commonly affected breeds for progressive rod-cone degeneration. An autosomal recessive mutation in the PRCD gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

== Working Cockers ==

This breed, like many others with origins as working dogs, has some genetic lines that focus on working-dog skills and other lines that focus on ensuring that the dog&#x27;s appearance conforms to a breed standard; these are referred to as the &quot;working&quot; (or &quot;field-bred&quot;) and &quot;conformation&quot; strains, respectively. After World War II, Cocker Spaniels bred for pets and for the sport of conformation showing increased enormously in popular appeal, and, for a while, was the most numerous Kennel Club registered breed. This popularity increased the view that all Cockers were useless as working dogs. However, for most dogs this is untrue, as even some show-bred Cockers have retained their working instinct.

Today, this breed is experiencing a resurgence in usage as a working and hunting dog. Dogs from working lines are noticeably distinct in appearance. As is the case with the English Springer Spaniel, the working type has been bred exclusively to perform in the field as a hunting companion. Their coat is shorter and ears less pendulous than the show-bred type. Although registered as the same breed, the two strains have diverged significantly enough that they are rarely crossed. The dogs that have dominated the hunt test, field trial and hunting scene in the United States are field-bred dogs from recently imported English lines. Working-dog lines often have physical characteristics that would prevent them from winning in the show ring. This is a result of selecting different traits than those selected by show breeders. The longer coat and ears, selected for the show ring, are an impediment in the field. Cuban authorities train and use English Cocker Spaniels as sniffer dogs to check for drugs or food products in passengers&#x27; baggage at Cuban airports.

=== Skills ===

A field-bred cocker spaniel is first and foremost an upland flushing dog. In performing this task there are some skills the dog must be trained to perform.

* Hup This is the traditional command to sit and stay. To be an effective hunter the dog must comply with this command absolutely. When this command is given, the dog can be given directions called to the handler. The ability to hup a dog actively working a running bird allows the handler and any gunners to keep up without having to run.
* Retrieve to Hand The majority of hunters and all hunt test or field trial judges require that a dog deliver a bird to hand, meaning that a dog will hold the bird until told to give it to the hunter directly.
* Quarter Dogs must work in a pattern in front of the hunter seeking upland game birds. The dog must be taught to stay within gun range to avoid flushing a bird outside of shooting distance.
* Follow Hand Signals Upland hunting involves pursuing wild game in its native habitat. Gun dogs must investigate likely covers for upland game birds. The dog must be responsive to hand signals in order for the hunter to be able to direct the dog into areas of particular interest.
* Steady When hunting upland birds, a flushing dog should be steady to wing and shot, meaning that he sits when a bird rises or a gun is fired. He does this in order to mark the fall and to avoid flushing other birds when pursuing a missed bird.

==In literature and film==

Elizabeth Barrett Browning wrote two poems to her red cocker spaniel Flush, &quot;To Flush, My Dog&quot; and &quot;Flush or Faunus&quot;.

The 1930 play &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; by the Dutch/English dramatist Rudolf Besier also had Browning&#x27;s red cocker spaniel as a central character. The play was adapted to two film versions in 1934 and 1957, a musical (&quot;Robert and Elizabeth&quot;), and a 1982 TV film &quot;The Barretts of Wimpole Street&quot; made by the BBC.

&quot;&quot; is a semi-fictional biography of Elizabeth Barrett&#x27;s red cocker spaniel written by Virginia Woolf and published in 1933.

Jasper is a cocker spaniel which features in the 1938 Daphne du Maurier novel &quot;Rebecca&quot;.

An English cocker is prominently featured in several episodes of James Herriot&#x27;s &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;.

An English cocker spaniel named Frisky is featured in the TV show &quot;Bluey&quot;. Frisky, who is voiced by Claudia O&#x27;Doherty, is depicted as Bluey&#x27;s fairy godmother.

<text>Campanula () is the type genus of the Campanulaceae family of flowering plants. Campanula are commonly known as bellflowers and take both their common and scientific names from the bell-shaped flowers—&quot;campanula&quot; is Latin for &quot;little bell&quot;.

The genus includes over 500 species and several subspecies, distributed across the temperate and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with centers of diversity in the Mediterranean region, Balkans, Caucasus and mountains of western Asia. The range also extends into mountains in tropical regions of Asia and Africa.

The species include annual, biennial and perennial plants, and vary in habit from dwarf arctic and alpine species under 5 cm high, to large temperate grassland and woodland species growing to tall.

==Description==
The leaves are alternate and often vary in shape on a single plant, with larger, broader leaves at the base of the stem and smaller, narrower leaves higher up; the leaf margin may be either entire or serrated (sometimes both on the same plant). Many species contain white latex in the leaves and stems.

The flowers are produced in panicles (sometimes solitary), and have a five-lobed corolla, typically large (2–5 cm or more long), mostly blue to purple, sometimes white or pink. Below the corolla, 5 leaf-like sepals form the calyx. Some species have a small additional leaf-like growth termed an &quot;appendage&quot; between each sepal, and the presence or absence, relative size, and attitude of the appendage is often used to distinguish between closely related species.

The fruit is a capsule containing numerous small seeds.

&quot;Campanula&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including common pug (recorded on harebell), dot moth, ingrailed clay (recorded on harebell), lime-speck pug and mouse moth.

==Cultivation and uses==
Well-known species include the northern temperate &quot;Campanula rotundifolia&quot;, commonly known as harebell in England and bluebell in Scotland and Ireland (though it is not closely related to the true bluebells), and the southern European &quot;Campanula medium&quot;, commonly known as Canterbury bells (a popular garden plant in the United Kingdom). As well as several species occurring naturally in the wild in northern Europe, there are many cultivated garden species.

The cultivars &#x27;Misty Dawn&#x27; 
and &#x27;Kent Belle&#x27; 
have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

The species &quot;Campanula rapunculus&quot;, commonly known as rampion bellflower, rampion, or rover bellflower, is a biennial vegetable which was once widely grown in Europe for its spinach-like leaves and radish-like roots. In many English translations of the Brothers Grimm&#x27;s tale &quot;Rapunzel&quot;, rampion is the vegetable that is stolen from the witch. (&quot;Rapunzel&quot; is a completely different plant, &quot;Valerianella locusta&quot;.)

In the UK the National Collection of campanulas is held at Burton Agnes Hall in East Yorkshire and the National Collection of Alpine Campanulas at Langham Hall, Bury St Edmunds, in Suffolk.

==Related genera==
The classification of some Campanulaceae genera as either part of &quot;Campanula&quot; or separate genera can vary by system, including &quot;Azorina&quot;, &quot;Campanulastrum&quot;, &quot;Canarina&quot;, &quot;Edraianthus&quot;, &quot;Musschia&quot;, &quot;Ostrowskia&quot;, and &quot;Platycodon&quot;. Some genera previously not segregated from &quot;Campanula&quot; currently are segregated in some systems, including &quot;Annaea&quot;, &quot;Gadellia&quot;, and &quot;Theodorovia&quot;. &quot;Hemisphaera&quot; was formerly &quot;Campanula&quot;, subsect. &quot;Scapiflorae&quot;, and &quot;Neocodon&quot; was &quot;Campanula&quot; sect. &quot;Rapunculus&quot;.

<text>Wesburn is a town in Victoria, Australia, 62 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Wesburn recorded a population of 1,052 at the .

Predominantly rural in nature, the township has a narrow ribbon of residential dwellings along and branching off the Warburton Highway.

The name Wesburn is derived from its original name of West Warburton. &quot;Warburton West&quot; Post Office opened on 7 February 1893, was renamed &quot;Wesburn&quot; in 1925 and closed in 1993. Wesburn was also served by a railway station on the former Warburton railway line until closure in 1965. Today the former railway line has been transformed into a walking and cycling path called the Warburton Trail.

Wesburn Primary School opened in 1904 after relocation of the building from Millgrove. The school has a current enrolment of around 100 and is a participant in the Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program.

The Wesburn Recreation Reserve hosts junior football and netball teams. The township is also serviced by a pub and a number of small shops. Public transport is provided by bus route from Warburton to Chirnside Park.

<doc id="611104" wikidata="Q2102711" url="?curid=611104" title="Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment">
<text>The Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment was a scientific experiment performed in May 1961 by Marshall W. Nirenberg and his post-doctoral fellow, J. Heinrich Matthaei, at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The experiment deciphered the first of the 64 triplet codons in the genetic code by using nucleic acid homopolymers to translate specific amino acids.

In the experiment, an extract was prepared from bacterial cells that could make protein without the presence of intact living cells. An artificial form of RNA consisting entirely of uracil-containing nucleotides (&quot;polyuridylic acid&quot; or poly-U) was added to the extract, causing it to form a protein composed entirely of the amino acid phenylalanine. This experiment cracked the first codon of the genetic code and showed that RNA controlled the production of specific types of protein.

== Background ==
Discoveries by Frederick Griffith and improved on by Oswald Avery discovered that the substance responsible for producing inheritable change in the disease-causing bacteria (&quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae)&quot; was neither a protein nor a lipid, rather deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). In 1944, he and his colleagues Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty suggested that DNA was responsible for transferring genetic information. Later, Erwin Chargaff(1950) discovered that the makeup of DNA differs from one species to another. These experiments helped pave the way for the discovery of the structure of DNA. In 1953, with the help of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin&#x27;s X-ray crystallography, James Watson and Francis Crick proposed DNA is structured as a double helix.

In the 1960s, one main DNA mystery scientists needed to figure out was the number of bases found in each code word, or codon, during transcription. Scientists knew there was a total of four bases (guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine). They also knew that were 20 known amino acids. George Gamow suggested that the genetic code was made of three nucleotides per amino acid. He reasoned that because there are 20 amino acids and only four bases, the coding units could not be single (4 combinations) or pairs (only 16 combinations). Rather, he thought triplets (64 possible combinations) were the coding unit of the genetic code. However, he proposed that the triplets were overlapping and non-degenerate (later explained by Crick in his Wobble concept).

Seymour Benzer in the late 1950s had developed an assay using phage mutations which provided the first detailed linearly structured map of a genetic region. Crick felt &quot;he&quot; could use mutagenesis and genetic recombination phage to further delineate the nature of the genetic code. In the Crick, Brenner et al. experiment, using these phages, the triplet nature of the genetic code was confirmed. They used frameshift mutations and a process called reversions, to add and delete various numbers of nucleotides. When a nucleotide triplet was added or deleted to the DNA sequence the encoded protein was minimally affected. Thus, they concluded that the genetic code is a triplet code because it did not cause a frameshift in the reading frame. They correctly concluded that the code is degenerate (multiple triplets can correspond to a single amino acid) and that each nucleotide sequence is read from a specific starting point.

==Experimental work==

In order to decipher this biological mystery, Nirenberg and Matthaei needed a cell-free system that would build amino acids into proteins. Following the work of Alfred Tissieres and after a few failed attempts, they created a stable system by rupturing &quot;E. coli&quot; bacteria cells and releasing the contents of the cytoplasm. This allowed them to synthesize protein, but only when the correct kind of RNA was added, allowing Nirenberg and Matthaei to control the experiment. They created synthetic RNA molecules outside the bacterium and introduced this RNA to the &quot;E. coli&quot; system. The experiments used mixtures with all 20 amino acids. For each individual experiment, 19 amino acids were &quot;cold&quot; (nonradioactive), and one was &quot;hot&quot; (radioactively tagged with 14C so they could detect the tagged amino acid later). They varied the &quot;hot&quot; amino acid in each round of the experiment, seeking to determine which amino acids would be incorporated into a protein following the addition of a particular type of synthetic RNA.

The key first experiments were done with poly-U (synthetic RNA composed only of uridine bases, provided by Leon Heppel and Maxine Singer). At 3 am on May 27, 1961, Matthaei used phenylalanine as the &quot;hot&quot; amino acid. After an hour, the control tube (no poly-U) showed a background level of 70 counts, whereas the tube with poly-U added showed 38,000 counts per milligram of protein. Subsequent experiments showed that the 19 &quot;cold&quot; amino acids were not necessary and that the protein product had the biochemical characteristics of polyphenylalanine, demonstrating that a chain of repeated uracil bases produced a protein chain made solely of the repeating amino acid phenylalanine. While the experiment did not determine the number of bases per codon, it was consistent with the triplet codon UUU coding for phenylalanine.

In analogous experiments with other synthetic RNAs, they found that poly-C directed synthesis of polyproline. Nirenberg recounts that the labs of Severo Ochoa and James Watson had earlier done similar experiments with poly-A, but failed to detect protein synthesis because polylysine (unlike most proteins) is soluble in trichloroacetic acid. Further, using synthetic RNAs that randomly incorporated two bases at different ratios, they produced proteins containing more than one type of amino acid, from which they could deduce the triplet nature of the genetic code and narrow down the codon possibilities for other amino acids. Nirenberg&#x27;s group eventually decoded all the amino acid codons by 1966, however this required additional ingenious experimental methods (see Nirenberg and Leder experiment).

==Reception and legacy==

In August 1961, at the International Congress of Biochemistry in Moscow, Nirenberg presented the poly-U experiments – first to a small group, but then at Francis Crick&#x27;s urging, again to about a thousand attendees. The work was very enthusiastically received, and Nirenberg became famous overnight. The paper describing the work was published the same month.

The experiment ushered in a furious race to fully crack the genetic code. Nirenberg&#x27;s main competition was the esteemed biochemist Severo Ochoa. Dr. Ochoa and Dr. Arthur Kornberg shared the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their previous &quot;discovery of the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid.&quot; However, many colleagues at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported Nirenberg, aware that it may lead to the first Nobel Prize by an intramural NIH scientist. DeWitt Stetten Jr., the NIH director who first hired Nirenberg, called this period of collaboration &quot;NIH&#x27;s finest hour.&quot; 

Indeed, &quot;for their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis,&quot; Marshall W. Nirenberg, Robert W. Holley, and Har Gobind Khorana were awarded the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Working independently, Dr. Holley (Cornell University) had discovered the exact chemical structure of transfer-RNA, and Dr. Khorana (University of Wisconsin in Madison) had mastered the synthesis of nucleic acids. Dr. Nirenberg showed - excluding nonsense codons - every combination of a triplet (i.e. a codon) composed of four different nitrogen-containing bases found in DNA and in RNA produces a specific amino acid.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; said of Nirenberg&#x27;s discovery that &quot;the science of biology has reached a new frontier,&quot; leading to &quot;a revolution far greater in its potential significance than the atomic or hydrogen bomb.&quot; Most of the scientific community saw these experiments as highly important and beneficial. However, there were some who were concerned with the new area of molecular genetics. For example, Arne Tiselius, the 1948 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, asserted that knowledge of the genetic code could &quot;lead to methods of tampering with life, of creating new diseases, of controlling minds, of influencing heredity, even perhaps in certain desired directions.&quot;

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Dr. Nirenberg has received the Molecular Biology Award of the National Academy of Sciences and the Biological Science Award of the Washington Academy of Sciences (1962), the Paul Lewis Award of the American Chemical Society (1963), the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Medal, along with the Harrison Howe Award of the American Chemical Society of USA, in America (1864).

<text>Clarence City Council (or City of Clarence) is a local government body in Tasmania, and one of the five municipalities that constitutes the Greater Hobart Area. The Clarence local government area has a population of 61,531, covering the eastern shore of the Derwent River from Otago to the South Arm Peninsula and the smaller localities of Cambridge, Richmond, and Seven Mile Beach.

The administrative centre and main commercial district of Clarence is Rosny Park, approximately 5 kilometres from the Hobart central business district. Bellerive Oval lies immediately to the south, and Hobart Airport is located further north-west along the Tasman Highway.

The area that now constitutes the City of Clarence was once part of the traditional land of the Moomairemener, a Tasmanian Aboriginal sub-group. In 1803, the island of Tasmania (then Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) was colonised by United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, who subsequently established the settlement of Hobart. By the 1820s the settlement had spread to the &#x27;Clarence Plains&#x27;, but the area remained primarily agricultural until the mid to late 20th century, when it experienced a residential development boom. Since then Clarence has grown rapidly to become a self-sufficient city.

==Etymology==

The City of Clarence is named indirectly after King William IV. From 1789 until 1830, when he ascended the throne, he was titled &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; The Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. It was during this period that the British settlement of Hobart was founded in 1803.

Prior to the establishment of the British colony there, Captain John Hayes of the East India Company had sailed up the Derwent River, with the vessels &quot;Duke of Clarence&quot; and the &quot;Duchess of Bengal&quot; in 1793. Relieved at making landfall following an arduous crossing of the Indian Ocean, Hayes named the region around Rokeby as &#x27;Clarence Plains&#x27;, in honour of the vessel having delivered them safely to a sanctuary. The vessel in turn, had been initially named in honour of the then future King. Almost immediately following the exploration of the region following the settlement of Hobart in 1803, Hayes name of &#x27;Clarence Plains&#x27; fell into common use.

For over half a century, this was the name of the entire eastern shore of the Derwent River south of the Meehan Range. When it was first incorporated as a municipality in 1860, the region became referred to as the &#x27;Clarence Municipality&#x27;. This was to remain the name of the region until 1988, when Clarence was officially declared a city, and the name changed to the &#x27;City of Clarence&#x27;. It is not usual for Clarence residents to be referred to by a gentilic, and if so they are usually given the title &quot;Hobartians&quot; along with all other residents of Greater Hobart, however locally they are usually identified as being &#x27;from the eastern shore&#x27;.

==History==
===Pre-history===
It is believed the indigenous Aboriginal Tasmanians have lived in Tasmania for at least 35,000 years. Aboriginal middens can often be found along the coastline of the City of Clarence such as at Shag Bay, indicating that they hunted, and searched for seafood and shellfish in the region.

Prior to the arrival of the British, there was nine distinctive &#x27;nations&#x27; or &#x27;tribes&#x27; within Tasmania. The eastern shore seems to have been home to the Moomairemener. It is not known if they were a separate nation, or a sub-group of the Oyster Bay Clan (Paredarerme) whose territory stretched from the Tasman Peninsular to St Patrick&#x27;s Head, just south of the modern Tasmanian township of St Mary&#x27;s.

For the Moomairemener the area along the eastern shore of the Derwent was known as &#x27;Nannyelebata&#x27; (or naniyilipata). They valued the region for its rich variety of birds, animals, seafood, and vegetation. The Coal River Valley, Flagstaff Gully, Risdon Vale, Risdon Cove and the southern Meehan Range were all regions that were within the traditional spring and summer hunting-grounds of the Moomairemener people, bringing them into conflict with the British invaders within five months of the establishment of the camp at Risdon Cove. This initial conflict grew into the Black War, which devastated the population of the native Tasmanians. The descendants of the indigenous Tasmanians now refer to themselves collectively as &#x27;Palawa&#x27;.

===European settlement===

Clarence was the site of the first European settlement in Tasmania (then Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) in 1803 at Risdon Cove. At the time Napoleonic France and Great Britain were at war with each other. Fearing the arrival of French explorers who may have wished to make a rival claim to the island of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, the then Governor of New South Wales, Philip Gidley King dispatched a young 23-year-old Lieutenant by the name of John Bowen to establish a colony there. The first vessel of his party, arrived in the Derwent on Wednesday, 8 September 1803, and Bowen arrived five days later aboard &quot;Albion&quot;.

Bowen selected the inlet at Risdon Cove, as when he had arrived in Spring the nearby stream was in full-flow. However within months it had dried up, and his camp was in despair for want of water. The site at Risdon Cove was badly affect by inconsistent water supply, and stagnation of the inlet during the late summer.
King was insecure about Bowen&#x27;s juniority and inexperience as a young commander, and when he was contacted by David Collins, who had been dispatched directly from England aboard with as a supply vessel, to establish a colony at Port Phillip, he redirected Collins&#x27; expedition to the Derwent.

Collin&#x27;s party arrived on the Derwent River on 16 February 1804, and immediately became becalmed in Storm Bay. Collin&#x27;s dispatched troops to row ashore off what is now Rokeby to march overland to the camp at Risdon and announce their arrival. The party found navigating the thick Australian bushland hard-going, but did gain useful intelligence as the nature of the area. In the end, they only arrived shortly before the ships were able to navigate up-river.

Upon his arrival, Collins discovered the camp in such a state of despair for want of water, it was threatened with collapse. He immediately set about his first task of relocating the colony to the mouth of the Hobart Rivulet on Sullivans Cove. From there, the city of Hobart grew.

The relocation of the colony did not end the desire to settle the eastern shore of the Derwent though. Within the first few years following the establishment of Hobart Town, difficulties in growing crops led to difficulties providing food. The initial intelligence from the soldiers that had marched overland from Rokeby to Risdon Vale, and subsequent explorations suggested the plains on the eastern shore of the Derwent were more suited to agriculture.

The successful establishment of crops on Clarence Plains was vital to the survival of Hobart Town. When new settlers arrived from Norfolk Island in 1808, some were granted land in the Derwent Valley, and others upon Clarence Plains. Very soon a mixture of mansions and fine houses, cottages, inns and churches began to be built in the area. However the population growth on the eastern shore was much slower than that of Hobart Town, despite the close proximity of the young town. By the 1810s, a ferryman was making regular crossings of the Derwent between Sullivans Cove, and &#x27;Kangaroo Point&#x27;, near where the ferry still arrives at Bellerive Quay. The point was so-called due to the large numbers of Kangaroos that would be seen grazing there in the first few decades after European arrival. By the late 1810s, farmers, timbermen, and pioneers had begun settling on the eastern shore of the Derwent River.

===19th century===

By the early 1820s a small village was growing around Kangaroo Point, that was soon to become Bellerive, making it the first site of permanent settlement in Clarence Plains. Bellerive was well fed by a freshwater stream that emptied into Kangaroo Bay, and it still exists running parallel to Rosny Park Public Golf Course as a storm water culvert.

The next areas within Clarence Plains to be settled on the eastern shore of Hobart&#x27;s Derwent River, were Rosny, and its neighbours Montagu Bay and Lindisfarne to the north. Private properties had been built in each of these localities by the late 1820s, commanding excellent views across the Derwent to Hobart Town and Mount Wellington. All three suburbs are named after the three fine houses established. Although private estates and farms began to spring up throughout the district, settlements were generally isolated, with Bellerive, Cambridge, Lindisfarne, and Richmond the only major settlements of note. In 1836, Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, George Arthur divided the island into administrative counties, and Clarence Plains fell into Pembrokeshire. Despite this, the Clarence Plains region became a municipality in its own right in 1860. In 1862, Bellerive also became the administrative centre of the municipality, and the Eastern Police District, but for much of the late nineteenth century, Clarence Plains experienced little development, remaining primarily agricultural.

A review of colonial defences in the 1870s saw a complete overhaul of the coastal defences of Hobart, and a new fortress called Kangaroo Battery was constructed between 1880 and 1888 just to the south of Bellerive. An industry that flourished throughout Clarence Plains was fruit growing, and by the 1880s several prosperous orchards were located within the region. A rare attempt at commercial opportunism was the short-lived Bellerive to Sorell Railway line (1892 until 1926) which had its terminus on a long jetty extending into the Bay on reclaimed land that now makes up part of the Bellerive Boardwalk. It was hoped that is could eventually be connected to the Tasmanian Main Line at Brighton, thus providing rail access to the south of Clarence Plains, Sorrell and the Tasman Peninsular, but engineering difficulties and economic problems led to its abandonment.

===20th century===

At the beginning of the twentieth century the eastern shore of the Derwent was still little more than isolated villages, and homesteads. This remained the situation for the next forty years, until on 22 December 1943, the floating pontoon style Hobart Bridge was opened.
Despite soon developing a reputation of being treacherous to cross in stormy weather, and suffering delays caused by its lifting span opening to allow maritime traffic to pass, it created previously unprecedented access to the eastern shore. Almost immediately demand for residential property there increased. By 1947 the population of Clarence Plains had reached 5,000 for the first time.

In the 1950s, post-war demand for housing led the State Government to create a public housing programme, providing cheap accommodation to cope with returning servicemen, and the boom in migrant labour. Suburbs such as Bellerive, Lindisfarne, Montagu Bay, Mornington, Rosny and Warrane all expanded dramatically throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and housing from the period still often bears the distinctive design patterns of former government housing. For many parts of the city electricity supply only arrived in the 1950s, and sealed roads, mains water, and sewage only began to be provided in the 1960s.

The eastern shore housing boom had highlighted the inadequacies of the Hobart Bridge. Bad weather made it difficult to cross, and the massive increase in traffic in the 1950s led to severe congestion. The traffic problems, delays caused by the raising of the navigation section for maritime traffic, and the toll all proved extremely unpopular. The government announced plans to build a new bridge at a cost of £7 million, and in 1960, construction commenced on the Tasman Bridge. It opened on 18 August 1964, and greatly increased the volume of traffic capable of crossing the river. The opening of the new bridge also saw the development of two new major connecting highways, the east-heading Tasman Highway, and the north-heading East Derwent Highway, greatly improving access both to, and through Clarence.
An increasing variety of services opened on the eastern shore. The Metropolitan Transport Trust supported the expansion into the eastern shore, by opening up an excellent network of bus routes into the municipality. In 1963 the Clarence War Memorial Pool was constructed, and in 1965, Eastlands Shopping Centre opened in Rosny Park, being further expanded in 1971 and 1978. The shopping centre proved a commercial success, and helped drive growth on the eastern shore. By the mid-1970s the population had passed the 40,000 mark at an incredible post-war rate of growth.

But the late twentieth century also saw two terrible disasters occur with Clarence. Much of the municipality suffered terrible damage and many homes were lost during the infamous 1967 Tasmanian fires. A second disaster occurred in the city in 1975 when the bulk carrier, &quot;Lake Illawarra&quot; collided with the Tasman Bridge collapsing a section of roadway in the Tasman Bridge disaster. Ironically, this event, which severed &#x27;The Eastern Shore&#x27; from Hobart for nearly three years, was responsible for considerable infrastructure growth on &#x27;The Eastern Shore&#x27;, leading to it being largely self-sustaining, and being declared a city in its own right by 1988.

In the 1970s and 1980s the expansion of the Municipality of Clarence continued. Many previously rural areas developed into residential areas. New suburbs arose, such as Flagstaff Gully, Geilston Bay and Old Beach to the north, and Cremorne, Howrah, Lauderdale, Rokeby and Tranmere towards the south of the city. At the same time, Rosny Park continued to grow in importance as the administrative centre of the city, with the Clarence Council Chambers, Bellerive Police Station and Bellerive Post Office all relocating there. Banking services also relocated branches, and many new retailers opened, complementing the prosperous Eastlands Shopping Centre. Commonwealth government offices soon also began opening with services such as Centrelink, the Australian Taxation Office and the National Archives of Australia. The growth was such that the municipality was officially incorporated as a city on 24 November 1988, with the population having grown beyond 50,000. In 1993, the nearby town of Richmond was absorbed into the city of Clarence.

===21st century===
The early 21st Century has seen Rosny Park continue to develop as the centre of the city. Expansion to Eastlands Shopping Centre and the nearby commercial businesses on Bligh and Bayfield Streets has seen a strong growth in retail. A Multi-screen cinema also opened in 2003, continuing the increasing availability of local services. The launch of the council&#x27;s &#x27;Kangaroo Bay Urban Design Strategy and Concept Plan&#x27; saw an attempt to modernise the town-planning of the City Centre with a programme of regeneration, improved infrastructure and amenities, the creation of a foreshore promenade and more appropriate urban landscaping. The plan sees the Kangaroo Bay area divided into five distinct precincts; Rosny Parklands, Kangaroo Bay East, Ferry Wharf, Bellerive Yacht Club, and &#x27;The Village&#x27;.

==Geography==
The City of Clarence, along with Glenorchy, Hobart, and Kingborough form Greater Hobart. The boundaries of the city stretch from the South Arm peninsula in the south bordered by Ralph&#x27;s Bay, to Seven Mile Beach and the Pitt Water in the east, bordered by Frederick Henry Bay, to the Municitpality of Sorell in the north-east, and the Southern Midlands and Municipality of Brighton to the north. The city&#x27;s western border is the Derwent River along the entire length.

In terms of area, Clarence is one of the largest cities in Australia, covering over 386 square kilometres, with 191 kilometres of coastline, including over twenty beaches, the most popular of which are Bellerive Beach, Howrah Beach, Seven Mile Beach and Clifton Beach. More than a third of the total city area is untouched bushland, with many parks, and large areas given over to nature reserves.

The city has large areas of residential property interspersed with natural flora, typically sclerophyll bushland. The city is dominated by the long, low-lying range of hills known as the Meehan Range which runs parallel to the river. A unique feature of both shores of the Derwent is the way that housing is only built to a certain height, preserving the natural skyline along the hill tops. There is large areas of farmland, and many vineyards, particularly in the Coal River valley. It also includes some rural and non-urban areas, such as the South Arm peninsular.

===Suburbs===

There are more than thirty suburbs with the city of Clarence. They are not named according to a convention. Many have been named after the first fine house that was built in the area (Bellerive, Lindisfarne, Montagu Bay, Geilston Bay and Rosny), others are named for geographical features (Flagstaff Gully, Mount Rumney and Roches Beach). Some, such as Bellerive, Lindisfarne and Richmond first developed as isolated villages, and others, such as Mornington and Warrane developed through public housing programmes.

Much of the city along the eastern shore of the Derwent is a connected urban environment, although primarily residential. From Cremorne and Rokeby in the south, Clarence continues uninterrupted to Old Beach in the north. Other suburbs, such as Acton Park, Cambridge and Richmond are isolated communities. Most suburbs are served by centralised commercial services that are found primarily in Rosny Park which is the city&#x27;s central business district. Other commercial services are still provided in the older village centres in Bellerive, Howrah, Lindisfarne and Richmond.

===Climate===
Located at 42° South, the City of Clarence has a mild temperate maritime climate (Group C:&quot;Cfb&quot;, according to the Köppen climate classification) with an average summer temperature of 21 °C. On average, Clarence is warmer, and has less annual precipitation than Hobart or Glenorchy. The southern regions of the city are notorious for being affected by strong southerly winds known locally as the &#x27;sea breeze&#x27;, particularly during summer months. The City of Clarence generally receives sunrise two to three minutes before Hobart and Glenorchy, and sunset is also experienced slightly after the western shore, due to the angle of shadow cast by Mount Wellington.

==Council==

Residents of the City of Clarence are administered through three tiers of government, as part of the Australian federal government system. The City of Clarence is a Tasmanian local government area administered by the Clarence City Council. Local authority, responsible for provision of such services as roads, libraries and planning permissions rests with the Clarence City Council.

Provision of services such as education, policing, and health care, rests with the Tasmanian State Government. At State government level, the city constitutes the largest proportion of voters for the State electoral division known as Franklin. The top level of government administration rests with the Australian Commonwealth Government, who are responsible for foreign policy, defence, employment, and taxation. Clarence constitutes a significant proportion of the Federal electoral division of Franklin.

Clarence is classified as urban, fringe and medium (UFM) under the Australian Classification of Local Governments.

===Current composition===
The Clarence City Council has existed in various forms since the area became a municipality on 1 January 1860, and is responsible for local government within the City. The council originally had its chambers in Bellerive, but these were moved to Rosny Park in the early 1980s. It operates a mayor-council system that consists of twelve aldermen that stand for four-year terms. Elections are held every four years in October, with the last election being in 2022. 

The current council is:

===2022 election results===
===State and federal politics===
The majority area of the City of Clarence falls within the Australian Electoral Division of Franklin, while a small part in the north of the electorate around Richmond falls within the electorate of Lyons. The boundaries of the electorate of Franklin at Federal level are also the same as those of the State Division of Franklin for the Tasmanian House of Assembly (lower house). For the State Legislative Council, the City of Clarence falls within the electoral boundaries of both Pembroke, and Rumney.

Franklin voters tend to be swing voters, and although there have been long periods of occupation by one major party or the other, Franklin has never been a safe seat. The longest-serving member was William McWilliams who held the seat in two separate terms for over 20 years. Although during this period he served as a member of five different Australian political parties, and as an independent member. Liberal (conservative) member Bill Falkinder was the longest-serving member who only represented one party, holding the seat from 1946 until 1966. Liberal member Bruce Goodluck also held he seat for 18 years from 1975 until 1993, but since then the seat has been safely in Labor hands, with Harry Quick (1993–2007), and Julie Collins (since 2007) holding the seat.

The Legislative Council seat of Pembroke was a non-party seat until 1991 when Independent Member Peter McKay joined the Liberal Party. The last Independent member for Pembroke was Cathy Edwards, who represented the seat between 1999-2001. The current member is Labor&#x27;s Luke Edmunds who has held the seat since 2022, replacing Jo Siejka, also from the Labor Party. 

In Rumney, the other Legislative Council seat within Clarence. Established in 1999, and first held by Labor&#x27;s Lin Thorpe. The current member is Labor&#x27;s Sarah Lovell, who has held the seat since 2017, replacing current Clarence Councillor Tony Mulder who served between 2011-2017.

===Policing and crime===
The responsibility of policing the City of Clarence falls to Tasmania Police, who are the sole law-enforcement agency in all of Tasmania. There is no local urban police force. Tasmania Police&#x27;s &#x27;East Command&#x27; district is administered from Bellerive Police Station, which is now located in Rosny Park.

A &#x27;Night Watch&#x27; had been established in Bellerive in the late 1820s, and by the 1830s, trooper police were operating throughout the district, with local gaols and constabularies located at Bellerive, Richmond, Cambridge and Sorrell. A new Bellerive Police Station and Watch House was completed in 1842, and has subsequently been used as municipal council chambers, a district library and the CIB headquarters, but at present it is used as a Community Arts Centre. The introduction of the Police Regulation Act 1898, which came into being on 1 January 1899, saw the creation of one unified police force for the whole colony. Bellerive Police Station remained one of the major regional stations, responsible for the &#x27;Eastern District&#x27;, comprising the municipal areas of Brighton, Central Highlands, Clarence, Derwent Valley, Glamorgan-Spring Bay, Sorell, Southern Midlands and Tasman (Tasman Peninsular). When Rosny Park grew in importance as the administrative centre of Clarence, Bellerive Police Station was relocated there. The station remains the administrative Headquarters of &#x27;East Command&#x27;.

Crime rates are generally low within the city, and Clarence is seen as an extremely safe place to live. According to 2016 statistics, the rate of homicide in the Region was 1.7 per 100,000, well below the national average. The rate of robberies was 33.2 per 100,000, also well below the national average. Motor vehicle crime was 551.4 per 100,000, slightly below the national average, although a significant decrease on the 2001 figure (613.9/100,000).

===Healthcare===
There were few health care facilities other than local general practitioner surgeries within the Municipality of Clarence prior to the Tasman Bridge disaster. The isolation caused by the severing of the bridge, and the inability of patients to travel across the river for treatment highlighted the need for local health care services on the eastern shore. The Bayfield Healthcare Centre (now known as the Clarence Community Health Centre) was developed at considerable cost to the state government, but soon became the City&#x27;s primary health care provider. Whilst it is definitely not large enough to be considered a hospital, recent upgrading has seen the centre fall into the super clinic category.

===Education===

The first school opened within Clarence Plains was the Kangaroo Point School (now Bellerive Primary School) in 1842. However, prior to the Tasman Bridge disaster, there were few schools within the Municipality of Clarence. The isolation caused by the severing of contact between the shores when the Tasman Bridge collapsed led to the establishment of many new facilities on the eastern shore, including new schools.

There are thirteen government, and six religious primary schools in Clarence. The government primary schools are: Bellerive Primary School, Cambridge Primary School, Clarendon Vale Primary School, Howrah Primary School, Lauderdale Primary School, Lindisfarne Primary School, Lindisfarne North Primary School, Montagu Bay Primary School, Richmond Primary School, Rokeby Primary School, South Arm Primary School, The Cottage School, and Warrane Primary School. The religious primary schools in Clarence are: Corpus Christi School, Eastside Christian School, Emmanuel Christian School, John Paul II Primary School, St Cuthbert&#x27;s Primary School, and St Johns School. During the period of isolation caused by the Tasman Bridge Disaster, The Friends&#x27; School established the Sherwood Primary School as an eastern shore branch for pupils in kindergarten to grade 2.

There are six High Schools within the City of Clarence. These are Clarence High School, Emmanuel Christian School, Geilston Bay High School, MacKillop College, Rokeby High School, and Rose Bay High School. The senior secondary Rosny College is also situated in the heart of Clarence. There is also a campus of TAFE Tasmania Technical and Further Education college.

==Economy==
Despite the existence of small-scale manufacturing, agriculture, and viticulture, it is retail and government administration that provide the primary impetus of local economy. Centred upon the administrative and commercial centre of the city at Rosny Park, retail provides the largest sector of the local economy, much of which in generated through Eastlands Shopping Centre, and the nearby shops of Bligh Street and Bayfield Street.

The primary export product of the City of Clarence is now wine. Based primarily around the Coal River valley between Richmond and Acton Park, the city&#x27;s viticulture industry is exemplified by European style wines, that are located at a similar latitude to French and German regions such as Champagne, Lorraine, Baden and Rheingau.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
Despite excellent bus connections, there is a very high proportion of private car ownership within the City of Clarence. Despite this, many residents, particularly those that commute to Hobart for work, often chose to use public transportation for commuting.

Clarence is connected to Glenorchy via the Bowen Bridge, and Hobart via the Tasman Bridge, both over the River Derwent. It is connected to Sorell at Midway Point by the 19th century historic convict built Sorell Causeway. The Sorrell Causway and Tasman Bridge both form part of the Tasman Highway (A3) which is the major east-west thoroughfare through the city. The East Derwent Highway (B32) also connects to the Tasman Bridge, but heads northwards instead, and eventually reconnects with the Midland Highway (A1) at Bridgewater.

Rosny Park Transit Mall serves as the hub for Metro Tasmania bus transportation within the city, which is the primary provider of public transportation in Clarence. Bus routes reach almost all major residential areas within the city. Ferry services operates services between Bellerive Quay and Sullivans Cove at peak times on weekdays.

===Utilities===
Most of the utilities provision within Tasmania has traditionally fallen to government authorities. Mains water remains so, and is now provided by the Clarence City Council. Their main public supply reservoir is Risdon Brook Dam. Ironically, it was the poor supply from this water source during summer months that originally led to the abandonment of the initial British camp at Risdon Cove. However its supply during wet months is ample, and the catchment at Risdon Brook Dam provides much of the city&#x27;s supply. This is supplemented by pipes that run under the carriageway of the Tasman Bridge. During the Tasman Bridge disaster, many witnesses recalled seeing large quantities of water gushing from the western side of the break in the bridge, and this was caused by these water supply pipes having been severed.

Electricity supply within the City of Clarence is administered by Aurora Energy on behalf of Hydro Tasmania, the state&#x27;s sole electricity supply company. 99% of energy is generated by hydroelectricity. There is no provision for mains gas supply anywhere within the City of Clarence.

==Culture, sport and recreation==

===Arts===
For many years the eastern shore of the Derwent River lagged behind the development of arts and cultural activities that had occurred within Hobart itself. The first attempt at redressing this saw the establishment of public libraries in Bellerive and Lindisfarne. The original Bellerive Police Station was also redeveloped as a Community Arts Centre.

The council now sponsors an exhibition programme of arts at the historic Rosny Farm property. In 2006 the farmhouse was redeveloped in sympathy with its heritage to allow new visual and performing arts spaces.

One area where the Clarence City Council has been particularly effective is in developing Community Arts events. For many years the Carols by Candlelight festival held annually in Charles Hand Park in the heart of the city, has continued to draw crowds of upwards of 20,000. Other annual events organised by the council include the City of Clarence Australia Day Festival, the Clarence Jazz Festival, and the Clarence Seafarers Festival – incorporating the Bellerive Regatta.

===Media===
The City of Clarence has few local media services, but is provided with media services that cover the entire area of Greater Hobart. The best selling newspaper is the daily &quot;The Mercury&quot;. In 1985 a local free weekly newspaper &quot;The Southern Star&quot; was begun by publisher Harris &amp; Co, however the difficult advertising market in a small community meant it could not sustain a rivalry with &quot;The Mercury&quot;, and it closed in December 1995. The Eastern Shore Sun is a freely delivered newspaper detailing local issues and events in the City of Clarence.

Television is provided by five licensed operators, the government provided Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and Special Broadcasting Service, and the commercial operators WIN Television and Southern Cross Seven. In 2004 Tasmanian Digital Television was developed as a collaborative effort between WIN and Southern Cross to develop a digital broadcasting television service.

===Elite sports===

The City of Clarence has a very active culture of sports. It is home to one of Australia&#x27;s nine test cricket grounds in Bellerive Oval. The ground usually hosts Australian home tests once every two years, and one-day internationals on an annual basis. It is also the home ground for the Tasmanian Tigers, Tasmania&#x27;s first-class cricket team.

Bellerive Oval is also home to two of the cities elite sports teams, the Clarence District Cricket Club who compete in the Tasmanian Grade Cricket competition, and the Clarence Football Club, known colloquially as &#x27;The Roos&#x27; who compete in the Tasmanian Football League, both of whom are semi-professional. Both sides also have derby rivals also based within the City of Clarence. For the cricket side, rivals Lindisfarne Cricket Club are located to the north, and for the Australian Rules football side, Lauderdale Football Club are located to the South.

Both teams have proved extremely successful: Clarence Football Club won the Tasmanian Football League in 1970, 1979, 1981, 1984, 1993–94, 1996–97, and 2000 (9 times in total), as well as winning the Southern Football League in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2006 (4 total), during the period in which the statewide league was not competed for. Clarence District Cricket Club have won 11 TCA Premierships in 1981–82, 1982–83, 1983–84, 1984–85, 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90, 1990–91, 1994–95, 2002–2003, and 2003-2004.

Other amateur cricket clubs, Montagu Bay Cricket Club, St. Aidans Cricket Club Inc. and Richmond Cricket Club are also based within Clarence, but compete in the Kookaburra Southern Cricket Association rather than the Tasmanian Grade Competition.

Olympia FC Warriors (based at Warrior Park, Warrane) and Clarence United (based at Wentworth Park, Howrah) are the city&#x27;s premier football teams, and play in the National Premier League. Nelson Eastern Suburbs FC is also based in Clarence at the North Warrane Oval and also compete in the Southern Championship.

===Other sport===
The standard of public sporting facilities is generally excellent throughout the city, with provision for most popular sports at venues such as the Clarence Aquatic Centre (home to the State Swimming Championships until 1998), the Clarence Sports Centre, and Wentworth Park, home base for Southern Touch (Touch Football) and also hockey.
Along with Clarence Sports Centre, Bellerive Sports Centre and Warrane Sports Centre provide facilities for sports such as basketball, indoor football, squash, tennis and badminton. Nearby Edgeworth Street in Warrane is home to a baseball ground and the Eastern Shore Action Indoor Sports Centre (covering Indoor Cricket, Indoor Soccer and Indoor Netball). North Warrane Oval is home to Eastern Suburbs competing in the Tasmanian Rugby Union statewide League.

There is also a very active club sports community within most of these sports. Tennis, golf and bowls are also popular, particularly amongst older adults. Rosny Park Public Golf Course is a 9-hole golf course located in the heart of the city, but there are also seven other golf courses located throughout Clarence, including Tasmania&#x27;s premier club, the Tasmanian Golf Club.

Most local schools participate in school competitions in major popular sports such as association football (also sometimes referred to as soccer in Australia), Australian rules football, cricket, hockey, netball, Touch Football, swimming and athletics. Many of these schools are equipped with their own home grounds for many of these sports and almost all at least have cricket grounds.

===Recreation===
The city of Clarence is blessed with many open spaces, parks and areas of bushland. In addition to hills, there is of shoreline, much of which is connected with paths, as well as over 30 beaches.
Bellerive Yacht Club is located within the city on the shore of the Derwent River in Kangaroo Bay. It is the second largest sailing club in southern Tasmania with over 800 members, and an annual turnover of over A$ 1 million. The club also host the annual Bellerive Regatta every February.
Other water sports and boating activities such as sailing, boating, fishing and diving are also popular within the city, which has eleven boat ramps, and numerous jetties. Cycling is also a popular activity, and several kilometres of cycleways exist within the city, particularly following the shoreline. Horse riding facilities can be found at Acton and surfing is popular at Clifton and Goats beaches.

<text>A caffeinated drink, or caffeinated beverage, is a drink that contains caffeine, a stimulant that is legal practically all over the world. Some are naturally caffeinated while others have &quot;caffeine added&quot; as an ingredient.

The most common naturally caffeinated beverages are coffee and tea, which in one form or another (usually served hot, but sometimes iced) feature in most world cultures. Other drinks are artificially caffeinated as part of their production process. These include certain soft drinks (primarily cola drinks), and also energy drinks designed as a stimulant, and to perpetuate activity at times when the user might ordinarily be asleep.

The consumption of caffeinated drinks is often intended entirely or partly for the physical and mental effects of caffeine. Examples include the consumption of tea or coffee with breakfast in many westernized societies, in order to &#x27;wake oneself up&#x27;, or the deliberate consumption of energy drinks by students wishing to study through the night, or revellers seeking to maintain an alert attitude during social recreation. Caffeine can cause a physical dependence, if consumed in excessive amounts. The need for caffeine can be identified when individuals feel headaches, fatigue and muscle pain 24 hours after their last energy drink.

Some commercially distributed drinks contain guarana, a South American berry with a caffeine content about twice that of coffee beans.

Many caffeinated drinks also have decaffeinated counterparts, for those who enjoy the taste, but wish to limit their caffeine intake because of its physical effects, or due to religious or medical perceptions of the drug and its effects.

In recent years, some alcoholic beverage companies have begun to manufacture caffeinated alcoholic beverages. The manufacturing of such beverages has been met with much controversy.

Beverages containing caffeine include coffee, tea, soft drinks (&quot;colas&quot;), energy drinks, other beverages. According to a 2020 study in the United States, coffee is the major source of caffeine intake in middle-aged adults, while soft drinks and tea are the major sources in adolescents. Energy drinks are more commonly consumed as a source of caffeine in adolescents as compared to adults.

==Beverages==

===Coffee===
The world&#x27;s primary source of caffeine is the coffee &quot;bean&quot; (the seed of the coffee plant), from which coffee is brewed. Caffeine content in coffee varies widely depending on the type of coffee bean and the method of preparation used; even beans within a given bush can show variations in concentration. In general, one serving of coffee ranges from 80 to 100 milligrams, for a single shot (30 milliliters) of arabica-variety espresso, to approximately 100–125 milligrams for a cup (120 milliliters) of drip coffee. &quot;Arabica&quot; coffee typically contains half the caffeine of the &quot;robusta&quot; variety. In general, dark-roast coffee has very slightly less caffeine than lighter roasts because the roasting process reduces caffeine content of the bean by a small amount.

===Tea===
Tea leaves contain more caffeine than coffee beans by dry weight. A typical serving, however, contains much less, since less of the product is used as compared to an equivalent serving of coffee. Also contributing to caffeine content are growing conditions, processing techniques, and other variables. Thus, teas contain varying amounts of caffeine.

Tea contains small amounts of theobromine and slightly higher levels of theophylline than coffee. Preparation and many other factors have a significant impact on tea, and color is a very poor indicator of caffeine content. Teas like the pale Japanese green tea, &quot;gyokuro&quot;, for example, contain far more caffeine than much darker teas like &quot;lapsang souchong&quot;, which has very little.

===Soft drinks and energy drinks===
Caffeine is also a common ingredient of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams of caffeine per 12 ounce serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams of caffeine per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts of caffeine with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.

===Other beverages===
* Mate is a tea-like drink popular in many parts of South America. Its preparation consists of filling a gourd with the leaves of the South American holly yerba mate, pouring hot but not boiling water over the leaves, and drinking with a straw, the bombilla, which acts as a filter so as to draw only the liquid and not the yerba leaves.
* Guaraná is a soft drink originating in Brazil made from the seeds of the Guaraná fruit.
* The leaves of &quot;Ilex guayusa&quot;, the Ecuadorian holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a guayusa tea.
* The leaves of &quot;Ilex vomitoria&quot;, the yaupon holly tree, are placed in boiling water to make a yaupon tea.
* Commercially prepared coffee-flavoured milk beverages are popular in Australia. Examples include Oak&#x27;s Ice Coffee and Farmers Union Iced Coffee. The amount of caffeine in these beverages can vary widely. Caffeine concentrations can differ significantly from the manufacturer&#x27;s claims.

==History==
Shantou University (STU) was founded in 1981 and started student enrollment in 1983. It is the only institution of higher education in the Chaoshan area.

STU, a key comprehensive university under the provincial Project 211 program, was founded in 1981 with the approval of the State Council. As the only public university that receives long-term funding from the Li Ka Shing Foundation, it is jointly supported by the Ministry of Education, the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Li Ka Shing Foundation. The Li Ka Shing Foundation has committed and donated a total of HK$5.4 billion to support Shantou University (including the Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business), of which HK$4.2 billion has already been donated as of 2012.

STU is planning to relocate the Medical College into the main campus and to develop a globally advanced curriculum focusing on life science. Since 2001, the University has conducted a profound internationalization-oriented reform, and overseas talents have been recruited to serve as provost, vice president and deans. Through a series of reforms in curriculum design, teaching, resources management and human resources system, it aims to offer a platform for the exploration of higher educational reform in China.

STU is strongly supported by the Central, Provincial, and Municipal authorities. The Current General secretary visited the university in the early 1990s. Former General secretary Jiang Zemin paid two visits to the university and wrote the following inscription as praise and encouragement to the staff and students: “The mission is demanding and the journey ahead is long.” Other leaders of the Central Government have also visited the university. Among them are Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Hu Jintao, Premier Li Peng, NPC(National People&#x27;s Congress), Chairman Qiao Shi, CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan, Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Vice Governor of Guangdong Wang Yang.

In 2012, the Ministry of Education, the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Li Ka Shing Foundation signed a tripartite agreement to co-develop STU. The agreement was reached to support STU’s continuing reform efforts geared to an internationally renowned and nationally elite university.

<text>Yarra Glen is a town in Victoria, Australia, 55 km north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Yarra Glen recorded a population of 3,012 at the .

==History==
The Ryrie brothers (William, James and Donald) were the first Europeans to settle in the area, when they established the Yering run in 1837 after droving their cattle from NSW. The brothers planted the first grape vines in the Yarra Valley in 1838 and produced their first wine in 1845. Joseph Furphy, often regarded as the father of the Australian novel, was born on the station in 1843.

The Post Office opened on 11 January 1861 as Yarra Flats and was renamed Yarra Glen in 1889 when the railway arrived.

The now National Trust-listed Yarra Glen Grand Hotel was established in 1888. Its four story Italianate tower was added subsequent to the construction of the original hotel building.

The Black Friday fires of 1939 badly damaged the area around Yarra Glen, as did the fires of 2009.

==Sport==
The town has an Australian Rules football team, Yarra Glen Football Club that competes in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League.

Yarra Glen has a horse racing club, Yarra Valley Racing, which schedules around nine race meetings a year including the Yarra Glen Cup meeting in March.

Yarra Valley Harness Racing Club conducts regular meetings at its racetrack in the town.

Yarra Junction is a small town with many activities, services and amenities including Cunningham&#x27;s Irish Inn and an RSL. Yarra Junction is said to be the functional hub of the Upper Yarra Valley.

The Post Office opened on 20 November 1901, a week after the opening of the Yarra Junction railway station as part of the railway line to Warburton. Between 1913 and 1945, Yarra Junction was the junction station for the gauge Powelltown Tramway. The railway, and the station, closed on 1 August 1965. The station building was constructed in 1888 at Lilydale railway station, but was relocated to Yarra Junction in 1914, following the construction of a new station building at Lilydale. The former station now houses the Upper Yarra Museum.

Yarra Junction has five schools, Upper Yarra Secondary College, Yarra Junction Primary School, St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School and the Little Yarra Steiner School. It is also home to the Cire Community School (previously called Yarra Valley Community School), an independent school for students for whom mainstream schooling has not been successful.

In addition to these schools, there is also a rural country campus for Caulfield Grammar School. The Yarra Junction Campus was established in 1949 and it was the first of its kind in Australia.

The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Yarra Valley Mountain District Football League. Its most famous product was former Richmond premiership ruckman Jack Dyer, also known as Captain Blood, who grew up in the town before moving to Melbourne in his late teens for school.

<text>Yellingbo is a town in Victoria, Australia, 48 km east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Yellingbo recorded a population of 582 at the .

==History==
The town formed around a store opened by James Claxton in 1883 next to Woori Yallock Creek, and was initially known as &quot;Claxton&quot;. When Claxton died his brother-in-law Henry Parslow and nephew Christopher John Parslow continued to run the store, and built a bridge over the Woori Yallock Creek there, whence the town was known as &quot;Parslow&#x27;s Bridge&quot;.
The post office opened a receiving office around 1902 as &quot;Parslow&#x27;s&quot; and a full post office in 1927 with Christopher Parslow as postmaster. In August 1946 it was renamed &quot;Yellingbo&quot; after the last Aboriginal resident, his name literally meaning &quot;today&quot; in the Woiwurrung language. The post office was closed on 23 February 1991.

==The town today==
Yellingbo&#x27;s town area contains a public hall, CFA, general store and tennis courts, as well as the Waterfall Art Gallery. The primary school closed in 2015.

==Biodiversity==
Nearby is the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, which contains three of the state of Victoria&#x27;s emblems: The last remaining wild population of the state bird, the helmeted honeyeater (&quot;Lichenostomus melanops cassidix&quot;). The geographically isolated state animal, Leadbeater&#x27;s possum (&quot;Gymnobelideus leadbeateri&quot;). Finally, common-pink heath (&quot;Epacris impressa&quot;) is the state floral emblem.

<doc id="611126" wikidata="Q4046285" url="?curid=611126" title="Pacific Century Group">
<text>Pacific Century Group (PCG), chaired by Richard Li, is an Asia-based private investment group founded in 1993 with interests in technology, media and telecommunications, financial services, infrastructure, property and other investments. It operates mainly in the Asia-Pacific region, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan.

PCG&#x27;s main subsidiary is PCCW, which is the largest telecommunications and IT provider in Hong Kong, and through which it controls Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) and Pacific Century Premium Developments among other companies.

==Background==
Richard Li first became interested in the TMT space in 1989 when he foresaw the opportunity for the creative development of information and home entertainment services in Asia and set-up STAR TV, Asia&#x27;s first satellite-delivered cable-TV service. By 1993 STAR TV had a viewer base of 45 million. In 1993, Richard Li sold STAR TV to Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation in 2 tranches for around US$1.0 billion, achieving a return of 9x over 3 years, and went on to form PCG.

==Acquisitions==

=== First Acquisition ===
PCG has a strong track record of holding and developing assets over the long term, and has a network of well-established connections in Asia. Its first foray into financial services came from the acquisition of Pacific Century Insurance (&quot;PCI&quot;) in 1994. PCI was listed on the stock exchange of Hong Kong in 1999. By 2007, PCI was the sixth largest life insurer in Hong Kong, including PCI Investment Management Between 2000 and 2007 this company&#x27;s assets increased seven-fold and the firm received numerous awards from Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s, as well as Lipper. Having grown the business in Hong Kong into a public company with a strong agency force and sound financial performance, there were limited opportunities for expansion in Asia at that time. In 2007, PCI was sold to Fortis to better position the business for the next phase of growth as part of a broader international platform.

=== Subsequent Acquisitions ===
PCG acquired AIG&#x27;s asset management operations, AIG Investments, in 2010, and renamed it PineBridge Investments after restructuring.

In February 2013, PCG announced the acquisition of the Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand insurance businesses from ING Groep N.V. (ING). PCG has said that these acquisitions are the first step in its plan to develop a world class pan-Asian insurance business to capitalise on the long-term potential of the insurance sector. The total cash consideration of the acquisition was US$2.14 billion (EUR 1.64 billion).

In September 2020, FWD Group, the insurance arm of Pacific Century Group entered into a strategic partnership with IPP Financial Advisers to develop life insurance products.

<text>William Abb Cannon Sr. (August 2, 1937 – May 20, 2018) was an American football halfback and tight end who played in the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL). He attended Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played college football as a halfback, return specialist, and safety for the LSU Tigers. At LSU, Cannon was twice named a unanimous All-American, helped the 1958 LSU team win a national championship, and received the Heisman Trophy as the nation&#x27;s most outstanding college player in 1959. His punt return against Ole Miss on Halloween night in 1959 is considered by fans and sportswriters to be one of the most famous plays in LSU sports history.

Cannon was selected as the first overall pick in the 1960 NFL draft and as a first-round territorial pick in the 1960 American Football League draft, resulting in a contract dispute that ended in court. Cannon played in the AFL for the Houston Oilers and Oakland Raiders before ending his football career with the Kansas City Chiefs of the NFL. He began his professional career as a halfback for the Oilers. A twice AFL All-Star, Cannon led the league in rushing and all-purpose yards in the 1961 season. He was named the most valuable player of the first two AFL championship games, which were won by the Oilers. He was moved to fullback and later tight end after being traded to the Raiders, with whom he won another league championship in 1967. That season, he played in the second AFL–NFL World Championship game, retroactively known as Super Bowl II, in which his team was defeated by the Green Bay Packers.

Cannon became a dentist after retiring from football. In 1983, after a series of bad real estate investments, he became involved in a counterfeiting scheme and served two and a half years in prison. In 1995, he was hired as a dentist at Louisiana State Penitentiary, a position he held until his death in 2018. His jersey number 20 was retired by LSU football in 1960, and he was inducted into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1975, the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 1976, and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2008.

==Early life==
Cannon was born on August 2, 1937, in Philadelphia, Mississippi, to Harvey and Virgie Cannon. The family moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father worked during World War II. While attending Istrouma High School in Baton Rouge, Cannon drew attention for his speed, strength, and size; he excelled in football, basketball, and track. In football in 1955, his senior year, Cannon scored 39 touchdowns, was included in All-State and All-America teams, and led the Istrouma Indians to a state championship. Although generally appearing in just the first half of games, he scored 229 points that season, a state record at the time. In track and field, he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds and put the shot over 56 feet, setting what were state records at the time for both events. In the summer of 1955, Cannon received a 90-day suspended sentence for theft after he and some friends were caught extorting money from men whom they had seen with prostitutes. This was the first in a series of legal troubles in Cannon&#x27;s life.

==College football career==
Despite his problems off the field, Cannon was recruited by many college teams to play football as he left high school. His leading options included Florida and Ole Miss, but he chose LSU, who offered a job between semesters at a local car dealership; other colleges did not guarantee a job. Additionally, Cannon&#x27;s mother believed he should remain close to home. &quot;Mommy was older and wiser, and I followed her advice,&quot; said Cannon.

===1957 season===
Cannon first played for the LSU varsity football team as a sophomore in 1957 under coach Paul Dietzel. He played in the halfback position and shared the backfield with Jim Taylor, who was selected as an All-American that year. He also played defensive back and was the team&#x27;s primary punter. He quickly emerged as a star, scoring twice in early season victories over Alabama and Texas Tech. The Alabama game was the most prolific rushing game of Cannon&#x27;s college career; he amassed 140 yards with eight carries. Against the Red Raiders, Cannon had five punts for a 40-yard average, completed two of four passes for 31 yards, caught a 59-yard pass for a touchdown, carried thirteen times for 36 yards, and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon recalled that Texas Tech&#x27;s focus was solely on Taylor. &quot;They were just wearing Jimmy out&quot;, he said. &quot;Of course, they weren&#x27;t looking for me. They just beat the devil out of Jimmy. With them focusing on Jimmy, I had a great game.&quot; Over half a century later, former Red Raiders standout Jack Henry recalled of Cannon:
We kicked off. And that damn Billy Cannon. Jim Henderson and I were running down in our lanes and got down there, and we were going to hit him high and low. We were going to knock the hell out of him ... We hit ourselves. Ran into each other. He made a 100-yard touchdown. You don&#x27;t forget that.

The Tigers won their next two games before losing four in a row, but remained competitive in every game, largely due to the play of Cannon and Taylor. LSU completed the season with a win over their rival team Tulane and a 5–5 record, although they had been predicted to finish last in their conference. At the end of the season, Cannon was included on the Associated Press (AP) Southeastern Conference (SEC) All-Sophomore team and the United Press International (UPI) All-SEC second-team. He also had the leading kickoff return average in the country (31.2 yards).

===1958 season===

In 1958, coach Dietzel implemented a method to keep his players fresh during games: his &quot;three-platoon system&quot; split the team into the &quot;Go Team&quot;, the &quot;White Team&quot;, and the &quot;Chinese Bandits&quot;. The White Team comprised the starting unit for the Tigers and, led by Cannon, consisted of the most talented players, who excelled on both offense and defense. Jim Taylor&#x27;s graduation allowed Dietzel to give Cannon more time playing on offense. LSU entered the season with talent and depth on both offense and defense. The team defeated its first five opponents by an average of three touchdowns. The sixth game of the season was against Florida for LSU&#x27;s homecoming. Cannon led the Tigers to a 10–7 win as he scored their only touchdown of the game in the second quarter. The following week the Tigers were ranked first in the AP&#x27;s weekly poll to rank teams. The team remained atop subsequent polls as it finished the regular season undefeated and was named national champion by the AP and UPI. LSU followed up with a 7–0 victory over Clemson in the Sugar Bowl. Cannon was responsible for the only points scored in the game; he threw a touchdown pass to Mickey Mangham and then kicked the extra point.

After the season, Cannon was unanimously recognized by sportswriters as a first-team All-American. He was awarded player of the year honors by United Press International, &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, and the Touchdown Club of Columbus. In addition, he was voted to the All-SEC team, and was deemed the SEC Most Valuable Player by the Nashville Banner after leading the conference in rushing yards, average, and touchdowns. Cannon finished third in voting for the Heisman Trophy, behind winner, Pete Dawkins of Army, and runner-up, Randy Duncan of Iowa. Dietzel said of Cannon&#x27;s accolades: &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful thing. Billy Cannon is the finest football player I&#x27;ve ever coached.&quot;

===1959 season===
With Cannon and most of the defensive starters returning in 1959, LSU was expected to compete for another national title. The Tigers began the season as the top-ranked team, and the number of season-ticket holders tripled compared to the previous season. The team won its first six games without allowing a touchdown. Cannon showed his versatility in those games; he led the team in total yards on offense, returned an interception for a touchdown on defense, and averaged 40 yards per punt while also returning punts and kickoffs. This set up a highly anticipated match-up between LSU and rival Ole Miss Rebels, who were also undefeated.

====Halloween run====
On Halloween night, Cannon led LSU into Tiger Stadium to face the third-ranked Ole Miss Rebels. For most of the game, neither team&#x27;s offense managed to reach the end zone. Late in the fourth quarter, when the Tigers trailed 3–0, Cannon returned a punt 89 yards for a touchdown, breaking seven tackles and running the last 60 yards untouched. The Rebels mounted one last drive and reached the Tigers&#x27; 1-yard line before Cannon and Warren Rabb made a game-saving tackle on the fourth down and with 18 seconds on the clock. The Tigers won 7–3. After the game, Cannon lay down in the tunnel, exhausted and unable to reach the locker room. LSU&#x27;s chances to repeat as national champion effectively ended the following week with a 14–13 loss to Tennessee, after a failed two-point conversion attempt by Cannon. The Tigers finished the season with a rematch against Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl, in which they were defeated 21–0.

====Heisman Trophy====
After the season, Cannon was awarded the Heisman Trophy as the nation&#x27;s most outstanding player in 1959. In the award&#x27;s balloting of 1,197 media members, he received 519 first-place votes; runner-up Richie Lucas received 98 such votes. Although he scored only six touchdowns during the season, Cannon&#x27;s defensive play and his performance on Halloween night was enough to convince voters. He received the award from Vice President Richard Nixon during a ceremony on December 9 at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City. Nixon described him as &quot;not an ordinary Cannon, but an atomic Cannon—the ultimate weapon in the arsenal of Paul Dietzel.&quot; He was the second player from the SEC to win the trophy, following Georgia&#x27;s Frank Sinkwich in 1942. Cannon was also a repeat winner of nearly every award he won the previous season, including unanimous All-America recognition.

==Professional football career==

===Contract dispute===
In November 1959, Cannon signed a contract with Los Angeles Rams general manager Pete Rozelle, in which he agreed to play for the Rams in the National Football League. The contract was for three years for $30,000, plus a $10,000 signing bonus. Two months later, on the field after LSU&#x27;s Sugar Bowl loss, Cannon signed another contract; this one was with the American Football League&#x27;s Houston Oilers, whose owner Bud Adams offered Cannon $33,000 a year for three years with a $10,000 signing bonus. At Cannon&#x27;s request, Adams also promised him a Cadillac for his father. When it became known that he had signed with two different teams, the Rams filed a suit that claimed Cannon was bound by their contract and could not sign with Houston. Judge William Lindberg ruled against the Rams, stating the contracts were void and that Rozelle had taken advantage of Cannon&#x27;s naivete. Lindberg described Cannon as &quot;exceptionally naive ... a provincial lad untutored and unwise in the ways of the business world.&quot; The AFL&#x27;s victory against the established NFL helped bring legitimacy to the fledgling league. After the ruling, Cannon finalized his contract to play in the AFL for the Oilers. The contract made him the first $100,000 professional football player.

===Houston Oilers===

Cannon joined the newly formed Oilers under head coach Lou Rymkus. As one of the highest-paid players in professional football, he was heckled early on by opposing players. Nor did he get along well with Rymkus, whom he described as &quot;unpleasant, confrontational, with a nasty disposition and an oversized ego.&quot; In Cannon&#x27;s rookie year, he led the team in rushing with 644 yards and caught five touchdown passes. His 88-yard touchdown reception from quarterback George Blanda in the 1960 AFL Championship Game helped the Oilers become the inaugural AFL champions. For his efforts, Cannon was named the game&#x27;s most valuable player.

After Rykmus was fired when the Oilers started the 1961 season poorly, Houston won ten consecutive games under Wally Lemm. In one of those games, against the New York Titans, Cannon set a professional football record with 373 all-purpose yards and scored five touchdowns. His 216 rushing yards in the game also set an AFL record. That December 10, 1961 game is also the highest scoring single-game fantasy football performance of all time in many scoring systems. At the end of the season, he was the AFL&#x27;s leading rusher with 948 yards and led the league in all-purpose yards. The Oilers repeated as AFL champions and Cannon again was the game&#x27;s MVP, scoring the only touchdown. &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named him to the 1961 AFL All-League Team and he was invited to play in the 1961 AFL All-Star Game.

Cannon injured his back in the third game of the 1962 season, which affected his performances, but he still finished second on the team in scoring behind Blanda. The Oilers reached the championship game for a third time, but lost to the Dallas Texans in the first ever double-overtime game in professional football history. New leg injuries and lingering back problems caused Cannon to miss most of the 1963 season. The Oilers also replaced Lemm as head coach. Because of this and his injury problems, Cannon successfully requested that the team let him leave. He later recalled: &quot;I left the team with good feelings and a lot of good friends. It was just time to go.&quot;

===Oakland Raiders===
Cannon was traded to the Oakland Raiders before the 1964 season. Raiders head coach Al Davis liked Cannon&#x27;s abilities but did not know how he wanted to use him. At first Davis moved Cannon to fullback, where he was an asset in catching passes, an attribute not all fullbacks then possessed. After a slow start, he finished the season with 37 receptions for 454 yards and eight touchdowns. He also rushed for three more touchdowns. Next season Davis moved him to tight end, to the chagrin of Cannon; he expected to be made into a wide receiver, but the Raiders had both Art Powell and rookie Fred Biletnikoff to cover that position. He eventually accepted his new role and adapted quickly to it. However, the tight end was seldom used in the Raiders&#x27; offense. He caught only seven passes that season with no touchdowns. Before the 1966 season, John Rauch took over as head coach as Al Davis became AFL commissioner and the Raiders&#x27; general manager. Cannon established himself as a deep threat in Rauch&#x27;s offense and caught fourteen passes for 436 yards—an average of 31.4 yards per reception.

By 1967, Cannon believed an AFL championship was imminent for the Raiders, and so fully embraced the team&#x27;s game plan. He convinced Davis to sign Blanda as a placekicker and a mentor for quarterback Daryle Lamonica. That year, Cannon led all AFL tight ends with 629 yards receiving and ten touchdowns in his most productive season at the position. For the second time he was an All-AFL selection, this time as a tight end. His efforts helped the Raiders to the 1967 AFL Championship game against the Oilers and a 40–7 victory over his former team. Because of a new agreement between the two leagues, the Raiders earned a place in the second AFL–NFL World Championship game, in which they faced the Green Bay Packers. Early in the fourth quarter, Cannon dropped a pass while wide-open on a play on which he would have scored. He later described it as &quot;the clumsiest drop of my career.&quot; Green Bay won the game, 33–14.

Cannon had a modest 1968 season in which he caught six touchdown passes—including one of 48 yards in the second quarter of the famous &quot;Heidi&quot; Game—but knew he would not be in Oakland much longer. Head coach John Madden had relegated him to running decoy routes by 1969 and he had only two touchdowns. Nevertheless, he was invited as a replacement to play in his second All-Star game. Cannon was released by the Raiders during the 1970 preseason.

===Kansas City Chiefs and retirement===
As he was preparing to begin post-graduate studies in orthodontics at Loyola University in Chicago, Cannon received a call from Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram. Stram signed Cannon to a one-year contract and he played in six games for the Chiefs in 1970, catching two touchdowns before a season-ending injury convinced him to retire. He ended his eleven-year professional career with 2,455 yards rushing, 3,656 receiving yards, and 64 touchdowns on offense. He also threw one touchdown pass and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon holds the NFL record for the most yards from scrimmage in a non-overtime game (330 against the New York Titans in 1961) and is tied with four other players for the most touchdown receptions by a running back in a season (nine in 1961).

==Personal and later life==
Cannon married his high school sweetheart, Dot Dupuy, while they were both freshmen at LSU. They had five children together. His son Billy Cannon Jr. played as a linebacker for Texas A&amp;M and was selected in the first round of the 1984 NFL draft by the Dallas Cowboys.

Cannon Sr. graduated from LSU in 1959 and completed post-graduate studies at the University of Tennessee during the Oilers&#x27; off-season. There, he earned a D.D.S.; later, he earned additional degrees in orthodontia from Loyola University Chicago. After retiring from football, he returned to Baton Rouge and started his own dental practice.

Despite a successful practice, by 1983 he was in financial difficulties from bad real estate investments and gambling debts. Becoming involved in a counterfeiting scheme, he printed $6 million in U.S. 100-dollar bills, some of which he stored in ice chests buried in the back yard of a house he owned and rented out. Charged along with five others, he served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana. Upon his release in 1986, he regained his dentistry license but struggled to rebuild his practice. In 1995, he was hired as a dentist at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, initially as a contractor. At the time, the dental clinic in the prison was in chaos; many dentists refused to work there and inmates were often unable to make appointments. Cannon reorganized the dental program with great success and was soon hired as a full-time employee. Warden Burl Cain, impressed with Cannon&#x27;s work with the dental program, put him in charge of the prison&#x27;s entire medical system. Cannon remained the resident dentist at the penitentiary, where inmates typically call him &quot;Legend&quot;.

Cannon resided in St. Francisville, Louisiana, with his wife. In February 2013, Cannon suffered a stroke and was hospitalized in Baton Rouge. He was released two days later, returned to work the following Monday, and made a full recovery. Cannon died in his sleep on May 20, 2018, at his home in St. Francisville, at the age of 80.

==Legacy and honors==
Cannon remains a respected and iconic figure in Louisiana sports despite his legal troubles. During a homecoming game for LSU in 2003, he was honored by the university as he stood on the field between the first and second quarters. Fans gave a long standing ovation and players raised their helmets in salute, leading athletic director Skip Bertman to proclaim to a friend, &quot;He&#x27;s still the icon, isn&#x27;t he?&quot; A video of his punt return on Halloween night in 1959 is still played on the jumbotron in Tiger Stadium before every home game. In a reader poll conducted by &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; in 2013 to name LSU&#x27;s best player since 1940, Cannon finished first by a landslide margin.

Until Joe Burrow&#x27;s win in 2019, Cannon was LSU&#x27;s only Heisman winner. Shortly after the 1959 season, the LSU football team retired his number 20 jersey. It was the only jersey retired by the team until Tommy Casanova&#x27;s number 37 was also retired in 2009. In 1969, he was selected as a halfback on the AP&#x27;s &quot;Southeast Area All-Time Football Team: 1920–1969 era&quot;. In 1975, Cannon was inducted into the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame, followed by the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame the next year. He had originally been elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983, but the hall rescinded the honor before his induction due to his confessed involvement in the counterfeiting scheme. The hall elected him a second time in 2008, and he was formally inducted during a ceremony on December 9 of that year. In 2012, Cannon was retrospectively given the Jet Award as a &quot;legacy&quot; winner for the 1959 season, honoring the top return specialist in college football. A statue honoring Cannon was erected near Tiger Stadium and unveiled on September 28, 2018, one night before LSU&#x27;s annual rivalry game vs. Ole Miss.

<text>The Grand Duchy of Avram is a micronation founded in the early 1980s by Tasmanian John Charlton Rudge, who styles himself the &quot;Grand Duke of Avram&quot;.

==Royal Bank of Avram==
The public manifestation of the Duchy was the Royal Bank of Avram, which at one time operated from retail premises owned by Rudge in George Town, Tasmania, and which still issues its own banknotes and coinage and platinum 1 ounce coins. This enterprise was later relocated to Strahan, on Tasmania&#x27;s west coast. Customers were required to exchange Australian currency for the Avram equivalents in order to obtain the currency. The Bank still operates today.

Due to its lack of a licence, the Avram Bank attracted the attention of the Australian government, who confiscated Rudge&#x27;s entire currency reserves and initiated proceedings against him in the Australian Federal Court system. After a total of six court cases, costing the federal government around A$22 million, the courts ruled that Rudge had not engaged in any illegal activity, and ordered the return of all the confiscated property, though some disappeared in Federal Custody and later appeared on the market. Rudge was permitted to resume his banking practices. He has issued several sets of coins and banknotes in the name of the Royal Bank of Avram since the 1980s (the most recent of which are dated 2008) and has told the media that the bank operates from a number of unspecified sites inside and outside of Tasmania.

Krause Publications&#x27; &quot;Unusual World Coins&quot; notes that since Rudge was found to be not guilty, &quot;his Royal Bank must be considered a legal institution&quot;. The coins were &quot;enameled on goldine plated metal&quot;, and issued in various denominations up to 250 Ducals. 100 Ducals is equal to 1 Avram, which is 1/30th ounce of gold.

==John Charlton Rudge==
Rudge was elected as a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly, representing the Liberal Party in the seat of Lyons. He served a single term and held the position of Shadow Minister for Construction. Rudge later served as a councillor and deputy mayor of the municipal council of Sorell under his legal name as agreed by Justice Pierre Slicer in one of his decisions.

Rudge claims dozens of &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;religious&quot; titles (among them &quot;Earl of Enoch&quot; and &quot;Cardinal Archbishop of The Royal See&quot;), which he asserts are of ancient origin. He also claims to be the grand master of a handful of ancient orders of chivalry, and to travel on an Australian passport that lists his various titles.

The Duchy of Avram has never claimed territory in the manner of other Australian micronations such as the Hutt River Province. As of 2008, Rudge was living in Sorell, and said that his duchy was &quot;philosophical, not territorial&quot;.

<doc id="611132" wikidata="Q9486" url="?curid=611132" title="Graham Taylor">
<text>Graham Taylor (15 September 1944 – 12 January 2017) was an English football player, manager, pundit and chairman of Watford Football Club. He was the manager of the England national football team from 1990 to 1993, and also managed Lincoln City, Watford, Aston Villa and Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Taylor grew up in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, which he regarded as his hometown. The son of a sports journalist who worked on the &quot;Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph&quot;, Taylor found his love of football in the stands of the Old Show Ground watching Scunthorpe United. He became a professional player, playing at full back for Grimsby Town and Lincoln City. After retiring as a result of injury in 1972, Taylor became a manager and coach. He won the Fourth Division title with Lincoln in 1976, before moving to Watford in 1977. He took Watford from the Fourth Division to the First in five years. Under Taylor, Watford were First Division runners-up in 1982–83, and FA Cup finalists in 1984. Taylor took over at Aston Villa in 1987, leading the club to promotion in 1988 and 2nd place in the First Division in 1989–90.

In July 1990, he became the manager of the England team. They qualified for the 1992 European Championship but were knocked out in the group stages. Taylor resigned in November 1993, after the team failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. Taylor faced heavy criticism from fans and media during his tenure as England manager and earned additional public interest and scrutiny when a television documentary, &quot;An Impossible Job&quot;, which he had permitted to film the failed campaign from behind the scenes, aired in 1994.
Taylor returned to club management in March 1994 with Wolverhampton Wanderers. After one season at Molineux, he returned to Watford and led the club to the Premier League in 1999 after back-to-back promotions. His last managerial role was manager of Aston Villa, to which he returned in 2002. He left at the end of the 2002–03 season. Taylor served as Watford&#x27;s chairman from 2009 until 2012, after which he held the position of honorary life-president. He also worked as a pundit for BBC Radio 5 Live.

==Early life==
Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Taylor moved in 1947 to a council house in Scunthorpe, where his father, Tom, was the sports reporter for the &quot;Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph&quot;. He went to the Henderson Avenue Junior School, then Scunthorpe Grammar School (now The St Lawrence Academy), where he met his future wife, Rita, from Winteringham. He played for the England Grammar Schools football team, and joined the sixth form after passing six O-levels in 1961, but he left after one year to pursue a full-time career in football. His head teacher disapproved of his actions and told him: &quot;Grammar school boys don&#x27;t become footballers&quot;.

==Playing career==
His playing career began with as an apprentice for Scunthorpe United. He then went on to join Grimsby Town in 1962 and played his first competitive game for them in September 1963 against Newcastle United when they won 2–1. He played 189 games at fullback for Grimsby Town, scoring twice. He was transferred to Lincoln City in the summer of 1968 for a fee of £4,000, scoring once in 150 appearances before being forced to retire from playing following a serious hip injury in 1972.

==Club managerial career==
===Records===
Taylor was the only manager to have twice led teams that amassed over 70 points in one Football League season under the League&#x27;s original scoring system of two points for a win and one point for a draw. This system was introduced for the inaugural 1888–89 season and was retained for over 90 years until the reward for a win was increased to three points in 1981. He achieved this with Lincoln City (74 points – 1976) and Watford (71 points – 1978). Only two other clubs, Doncaster Rovers (72 points – 1947) and Rotherham United (71 points – 1951), managed to gain over 70 points in one season under the original scoring system.

===Lincoln City (1972–1977)===
Taylor was the youngest person to become an FA coach, at the age of 27. Following his retirement from playing, and a spell as player coach, Taylor became manager of Lincoln City, being the youngest manager in the league at the age of 28, on 7 December 1972 after David Herd resigned. In his first season Lincoln finished 10th, then 12th in 1974, but the following season narrowly missed out on promotion after a 3–2 defeat at Southport on 28 April 1975.

Taylor led Lincoln to the Fourth Division title in 1976; his team&#x27;s 32 wins, 4 defeats and 74 points were all league records (when 2 points were awarded for a win). Lincoln finished 9th in the Third Division in 1976-1977 under Taylor.

===Watford (1977–1987)===
In June 1977, Taylor was hired to manage Watford by new owner Elton John. He turned down an approach from First Division West Bromwich Albion in favour of the Hertfordshire-based club, then competing in the Fourth Division, surprising pundits and supporters alike. John acted on the advice of Don Revie when hiring Taylor.

Taylor led Watford from the Fourth Division to the First Division in only five years. In his first season Watford won the 1977–78 Fourth Division title, losing only five of 46 games and winning the division by 11 points. In the Third Division Taylor led Watford to another promotion, finishing second, and losing out on the title by one point in the 1978–79 season.

Taylor&#x27;s third season, in the Second Division, was less successful. Indicating the tougher competition, Watford managed only an 18th finish, out of 22 teams, avoiding relegation by eight points and winning only 12 of their 42 games in the 1979–80 season. In the next season, the 1980–81 season, Taylor improved Watford&#x27;s performance, ending it with 16 wins and a 9th-place finish. In the 1981–82 season Watford achieved promotion, ending the season in 2nd place, and gaining 23 wins and 11 draws in 42 games.

In the First Division with Taylor as manager, Watford gained its highest-ever victory (8–0 against Sunderland) as well as the &quot;double&quot; over Arsenal, an away win at Tottenham Hotspur, and home victories over Everton and Liverpool; this resulted in Watford finishing runners-up in the entire Football League. He then took the side to the third round of the UEFA Cup, having finished second in 1982–83 (the club&#x27;s first season as a top division club). Taylor also led Watford to the 1984 FA Cup final, which Watford lost to Everton 2–0. In his final season, 1986–87, Watford finished ninth in the league and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, missing out on another Wembley appearance when they lost to Tottenham Hotspur, their chances hardly helped by the fact that both of their first team goalkeepers were injured.

===Aston Villa (1987–1990)===
In May 1987, Taylor left Watford for a new challenge at Aston Villa, who had just been relegated from the First Division. Second-tier football was a terrible setback for the Midlanders, who had won the European Cup just five years earlier and had been league champions six years earlier.

Taylor managed to take Aston Villa back to the top flight with his first attempt, securing their top flight safety in 1988–89 with a draw on the final day of the league season. During his third season at the club Villa finished runners-up in the First Division, having led the league table at several stages of the season before being overhauled in the final weeks by Liverpool. Following this success, Taylor accepted an offer to take over the England national football team from Bobby Robson, who left the job after England&#x27;s semi-final defeat to West Germany at the 1990 World Cup.

==International management: England (1990–1993)==
===Appointment===
When Taylor was appointed, critics in the media complained that he had never won a major trophy – although he had taken teams to second place in the league twice and an FA Cup final once in 1984. It was also pointed out that Taylor had never played in &quot;top-flight&quot; football, let alone international level and that winning the respect of the players might be difficult. His critics also noted although he had ditched the long-ball game at Aston Villa, there were still tactical worries about his intentions, given that English clubs were looking to dispense with &quot;route one&quot; football in favour of a more &quot;picturesque route to goal&quot;.

===1992 European Championship===
Despite the unease at his appointment, England lost just once in Taylor&#x27;s first 23 matches (a 1–0 defeat to Germany at Wembley Stadium in September 1991). However, England struggled to qualify for Euro &#x27;92. In a group containing Turkey, Ireland, and Poland, England were held to two 1–1 draws by Ireland and managed just 1–0 wins home and away against Turkey. It was only a late goal from Gary Lineker against Poland that saw England qualify at Ireland&#x27;s expense. England&#x27;s qualification for the Euro 92 finals proved to be the high point of Taylor&#x27;s tenure.

The number of players that Taylor was using in the run up to the championship was also questioned, the press and public viewed this as evidence Taylor did not know his best team. He used 59 players in total, as he struggled to find a &quot;new spine&quot; after the retirement of Peter Shilton, Terry Butcher and Bryan Robson. He also faced accusations he could not cope with &quot;stars&quot;, after he dropped Paul Gascoigne for Gordon Cowans for a qualifying game against Ireland. fearing he might &quot;lose his head&quot; in what would be a &quot;bruising&quot; encounter. Matters were not helped by Taylor&#x27;s reluctance to use creative players who were not perceived to have high work rates, such as Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley. He also suffered several injuries, notably to Gary Stevens, Lee Dixon, John Barnes and Paul Gascoigne, leaving the squad in a makeshift position going into the finals.

England were drawn to face France, Denmark and hosts Sweden in group 1. In the opening game against Denmark, England started brightly and missed several chances to take a lead. David Platt was guilty of a particularly glaring miss. Thereafter, Denmark began to dominate the match, and nearly won with minutes left as John Jensen struck a post. The game ended 0–0. In the match against France, Platt nearly scored with a diving header which went inches wide of the post, and Stuart Pearce hit the bar with a free-kick. The game also ended 0–0.

England needed to beat hosts Sweden to advance to the semi-finals. Lineker crossed for Platt to open the scoring on four minutes with a mishit volley. However, England wasted several chances to extend their lead. Platt made a pass to Tony Daley who wasted a chance to pass to Lineker in the open. England held a slender 1–0 lead at half-time. After half-time, Sweden changed their personnel and formation, and dominated the second half, scoring twice to win 2–1 and eliminating England.

During the game, after 60 minutes and with the score at 1–1, Taylor substituted Gary Lineker in his final game for England, preventing Lineker from having the chance to equal, or possibly break, Bobby Charlton&#x27;s record of 49 goals for England. Many were dismayed to see Taylor substitute England&#x27;s top striker when his side needed a goal. This led to the media&#x27;s vilification of Taylor, including the &quot;turnip&quot; campaign by &quot;The Sun&quot;, which began the morning after the game under the headline: &quot;Swedes 2 Turnips 1&quot;. During that campaign, the newspaper&#x27;s back page featured an image of Taylor&#x27;s face superimposed onto a turnip.

===1994 World Cup Qualification===
====Stuttering start====

Taylor&#x27;s relationship with the press was partially restored when he admitted his mistakes a few weeks after the finals. However, this did not last long. England&#x27;s first game after Euro 92 ended in a 1–0 defeat to Spain in a friendly, &quot;The Sun&quot; depicted Taylor as a &quot;Spanish onion&quot;.

England were drawn in Qualification Group 2 for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. The group contained Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Turkey and San Marino. England were expected to qualify along with the Dutch.

England began with a disappointing 1–1 draw with Norway. Norway were the early pace setters, with victories over San Marino, the Netherlands and Turkey. Gascoigne returned, but the Norwegians were confident. Despite dominating the game, England could muster only half-chances. Platt gave England the lead in the 55th minute after a cross from Stuart Pearce.

Norway rarely threatened, but equalised in the 77th minute, when Kjetil Rekdal scored from 20 yards. The draw flattered the Norwegians but put them clear in the group.

====Three wins and a Dutch draw====
The campaign seemed to get back on track with two wins against Turkey (4–0 at home and 2–0 away) and a 6–0 home victory over San Marino. During the latter game, Taylor confronted a spectator who was racially abusing Jamaica-born John Barnes, telling him &quot;You&#x27;re talking about another human being so just watch your language&quot;.

In April 1993 England faced the Netherlands at Wembley Stadium. England went 2–0 up in 24 minutes through John Barnes and David Platt. However, Taylor&#x27;s luck had started to take a turn for the worse, as Paul Gascoigne was injured by Jan Wouters&#x27; elbow, but Wouters was not sent off.

Dennis Bergkamp scored a goal for the Netherlands towards the end of the first half, against the run of play, but England continued to control the game, and looked to be heading for a win which would have ended Dutch hopes of qualification, following the side&#x27;s defeat in Norway, and a draw at home to Poland.

But four minutes from full-time Marc Overmars outpaced Des Walker, prompting Walker to foul him inside the penalty area. The penalty was converted by Peter Van Vossen and the game ended 2–2. Suddenly England&#x27;s &quot;World Cup life&quot; looked in danger.

====Draw in Poland, defeat in Norway====
England&#x27;s next chance of reviving their flagging fortunes came in May, requiring at least a win and draw away against Poland and Norway which were to be played just three days apart. England were poor against Poland and were largely outplayed. Dariusz Adamczuk of Poland scored in the 36th minute, although the team missed several chances to extend their lead. Ian Wright salvaged a vital point through forcing an equaliser in the 85th minute, for a final score of 1–1. Taylor was again vilified for his team&#x27;s poor performance. England&#x27;s next opponents were Norway.

The Norwegians had arrived from obscurity and had taken the group by storm; their series of early victories had left England, Poland, and the Netherlands scrapping for second place. Taylor made wholesale changes of personnel and tactics, which again drew criticism, his actions considered risky in what was now a crucial game. Lee Sharpe and Lee Dixon came on as wing-backs, while Carlton Palmer and Platt occupied midfield berths. Gascoigne supported Teddy Sheringham and Les Ferdinand up-front. Des Walker, Tony Adams and Gary Pallister formed a back three.

England lost 2–0, with few attempts on goal. Lars Bohinen and Øyvind Leonhardsen scored the goals in the 42nd and 47th minutes. The first was caused by a Des Walker error, while Walker was beaten for pace by a Norwegian counter-attack for Bohinen to score Subsequently, Taylor said: &quot;We made a complete mess of it. I&#x27;m here to be shot at and take the rap. I have no defence for our performance&quot;, although his honesty did not spare him a roasting from the press, who were now calling for his head. The press came up with headlines such as &quot;NORSE MANURE&quot; and &quot;OSLO RANS&quot;.

In July 1993, Peter Newman, an independent candidate in a parliamentary by-election for Christchurch, stood under the banner &quot;Sack Graham Taylor&quot;.

====The US Cup====
With their World Cup hopes hanging by a thread, Taylor&#x27;s England were to play a four-team Tournament in the U.S (1993 U.S. Cup), which was expected to be a precursor to the following summer&#x27;s tournament. Taylor stated before the game against the United States:In football, you&#x27;re only as good as your last game, and at the moment we&#x27;re poor. You can always lose any game, to anyone. It&#x27;s how you lose that matters.

That was the thing that shocked us all in Norway. We would have been looking for a win here anyhow, but if we&#x27;d won last week, it wouldn&#x27;t have been considered essential. Now it is. Whether we like it or not, people expect us to beat America, and there is definitely more intensity about this game because of our performance in the last one.

For Taylor, the US Cup began with a humiliating 2–0 defeat in Boston, to the United States with Thomas Dooley and Alexi Lalas scoring goals, which was reported by &quot;The Sun&quot; as &quot;YANKS 2 PLANKS 0!&quot;.

Some pride was restored with a credible 1–1 draw with Brazil, and a narrow 2–1 defeat to Germany. Taylor was now living on borrowed time.

====Crucial match against the Netherlands====
The 1993–94 season began with a much-improved performance, with a 3–0 win over Poland raising the nation&#x27;s hopes going into what was now the crucial match against the Netherlands in Rotterdam.

In October, England were to play the Netherlands in Rotterdam. With Norway having won the group, the encounter would effectively decide the second and last qualifier of the group. The game was played at a furious pace, with the Netherlands putting England under pressure early on. However, England hit back with a string of counterattacks, with Platt heading just wide and Tony Adams having a shot cleared off the line by Erwin Koeman, while Tony Dorigo hit a post with a deflected 35-yard free-kick after 25 minutes.

Two minutes before half-time England were fortunate to have a Frank Rijkaard goal ruled out for offside, even though replays showed the goal was legitimate. Later in the second half, with the game scoreless, David Platt was fouled by Ronald Koeman as he approached the Dutch goal. The German referee failed to apply the rule of sending him off for a professional foul. The Dutch charged down Dorigo&#x27;s free kick, although they were clearly encroaching. Just minutes later, Koeman took a free kick outside England&#x27;s penalty area. His first shot was blocked, but it was ordered to be retaken because of encroachment. Koeman scored at the second attempt.

Paul Merson hit a post with a free-kick moments later, before Dennis Bergkamp scored, despite using his arm to control the ball, for a 2–0 win. In the meantime, Taylor was in an apoplectic mood on the touchline, berating the officials and referee as the significance of the result sank in.

====San Marino and resignation====
England still had a chance to qualify, providing the Netherlands lost in Poland on the same night, with England winning by a seven-goal margin or more. As such, England were hoping they could run up a big score against part-time minnows San Marino. But after just 8.3 seconds of play David Gualtieri, a computer salesman, scored the fastest ever World Cup goal after a defensive error from Stuart Pearce. England took another twenty minutes to find an equaliser and eventually won 7–1. Even if the Netherlands had not beaten Poland, England&#x27;s inferior goal difference would have still meant they had failed to qualify.

Taylor resigned on 23 November 1993, six days after England&#x27;s failure to qualify. He went &quot;with great sadness&quot;, saying: &quot;No one can gauge the depth of my personal disappointment at not qualifying for the World Cup. This is the appropriate course of action in the circumstances,&quot; he said. &quot;If we didn&#x27;t qualify, it was always my intention to offer my resignation.&quot; Taylor had also agreed to be filmed during the qualifying campaign for &quot;Cutting Edge&quot;, a Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary series, in which his portrayal further undermined his authority. This was during the film &quot;An Impossible Job&quot;; Taylor was heard to use foul language, and what became his personal catchphrase: &quot;Do I not like that&quot;, uttered just before England conceded a goal to Poland.

==Return to club management==
===Wolverhampton Wanderers (1994–1995)===
Sir Jack Hayward appointed Taylor as manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers in March 1994, replacing Graham Turner. Taylor had been a generally unpopular figure in English football since his unsuccessful reign as national coach, and few people seemed willing to forgive him for his first managerial failure – one that mattered most to so many people up and down the country. But the following season Taylor took the Midlands club to fourth in Division One to qualify for the playoffs – their highest league finish since their last top division season eleven years earlier – where they lost out to Bolton Wanderers. They also reached the quarter-finals of the FA Cup after a memorable replay penalty shootout victory over Sheffield Wednesday, in which they were 3–0 down on penalties, only to win the shootout 4–3, in which Chris Bart-Williams had two penalties saved over the two matches.

Taylor spent heavily on players while at Wolves, paying large sums for the likes of Steve Froggatt, Tony Daley, Mark Atkins, John de Wolf, Dean Richards and Don Goodman.

However, the 1994–95 season proved to be his only full season at Molineux, as, after a poor start to the following campaign, winning just four of the first sixteen league games, he resigned on 13 November 1995 due to overwhelming supporter pressure. During his tenure, he attempted to perform a citizen&#x27;s arrest on a fan who had spat at him, prompting calls for closer crowd controls in the English game.

Taylor called his Wolves&#x27; departure his &quot;lowest ebb&quot; in football - greater than even his Lancaster Gate exit - because he felt he had &quot;lost his standing&quot; in the game of football.

===Return to Watford (1996–2001)===
In February 1996 Elton John, who had recently bought Watford for a second time, appointed Taylor as General Manager at Vicarage Road. Just over a year later Taylor had appointed himself as the club&#x27;s manager succeeding Kenny Jackett, who was relegated to a coaching capacity at the club. Taylor later stated that the role of General Manager had &quot;bored me stiff&quot;. He won the Division Two championship at his first attempt in 1998.

The following season Watford won the Division One Play-off Final, beating Bolton Wanderers 2–0 at Wembley, and with it promotion to the Premier League. Taylor missed two months of the season as in November 1998 he was taken to hospital with a life-threatening abscess that blocked his windpipe and almost killed him.

Watford were relegated from the Premiership after one season. Despite starting the following season well – unbeaten through the first fifteen league games and heading the table – Watford slumped to finish 9th in Division One. At this point he decided to retire. During this final season Taylor had become only the third manager to manage 1,000 league games in England, after Brian Clough and Jim Smith.

===Return to Aston Villa (2002–2003)===
Taylor came out of retirement in February 2002 to return to his old job at Aston Villa, but retired for a second time after Villa finished the 2002–03 season in 16th place in the Premiership. He subsequently cited tensions in his relationship with the club&#x27;s chairman Doug Ellis and argued for an overhaul of the club&#x27;s upper management to allow the club to be more competitive.

==Later life==

In 2003, Taylor became vice-president at Division Three club Scunthorpe United, his hometown club. From 2004, he worked as a pundit on BBC Radio Five Live, and managed a team of celebrities for Sky One&#x27;s annual series, &quot;The Match&quot;.

His time at Scunthorpe saw a turnaround in the club&#x27;s fortunes. In his first season on the board, they narrowly avoided relegation to the Conference. The following season, they were promoted to League One. Two years after that, they were promoted to the Championship as League One champions.

Taylor returned to Watford on 23 January 2009, being appointed to the new board as a non-executive director and was appointed interim chairman on 16 December 2009. Taylor announced his resignation from his position as chairman on 30 May 2012. He retained the position of honorary life president of the club until his death in 2017.

In 2014, Watford renamed the Rous Stand the Graham Taylor Stand to honour his achievements in two spells at the club.

==Other work==
Taylor was a supporter of Sense-National Deafblind and Rubella Association and a Patron of DebRa. He was a Celebrity Ambassador for the Sense Enterprise Board in Birmingham, and worked to raise both funds and awareness, including running the London Marathon in 2004. He regularly hosted moderated &quot;online coaching seminars&quot; on the DALnet channel. He also supported the Royal British Legion and cycled from London to Paris in 2010 to raise funds for the RBL&#x27;s Poppy appeal.

==Personal life and death==
Taylor married Rita Cowling at Scunthorpe Congregationalist Church on 22 March 1965. They had two daughters.

Taylor died suddenly and unexpectedly of a &quot;suspected heart attack&quot; at his home in Kings Langley early on the morning of 12 January 2017. He was 72. His funeral was held nearby, on 1 February at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Watford, with many football figures in attendance.

<text>Yering is a town in Victoria, Australia, 38 km north-east from Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the Shire of Yarra Ranges local government area. Yering recorded a population of 138 at the .

Yering was home to one of Victoria&#x27;s first wineries.

==History==

In 1837, brothers William, Donald and James Ryrie, accompanied by four convict stockmen, set out from the Monaro region of New South Wales driving 250 head of stock, settling in the Yarra Valley at Yering, which was the Indigenous name for the local area. They also brought wines with them, and when visitors came to the property, they were treated to wine labelled by Donald Ryrie (his brothers having meanwhile returned to New South Wales) as &quot;Chateau Yering&quot; with ironic overstatement.

By the 1850s, the property had been acquired by two immigrant families from Neuchâtel, Switzerland—the de Castella and de Pury families, who founded two other wineries on the property, Yeringberg and St Hubert&#x27;s. All three won Victorian and international awards, including &quot;Best Victorian Vineyard&quot; in 1861 and, in 1889, at the Paris Exhibition, Yering was awarded the only &quot;Grand Prix&quot; to a winery outside the Northern Hemisphere.

Post Offices opened as St Huberts on 1 January 1874 (renamed Yeringberg in 1890 and closing in 1942), Yering on 1 December 1884 (closing 1893), and Yering R. S. (for &quot;Railway Station&quot;) on 10 April 1890 (renamed Yering about 1915).

The railway arrived in 1888.

The 1890s depression saw table wines decline in popularity and the land, for cattle-grazing and dairying purposes, become more valuable than the vines. Paul de Castella sold Chateau Yering in 1896. The area became the centre of a modern revival of Yarra Valley winemaking in the 1960s, with the original wineries coming back into production and many others established.

==Present day==

The original 1854 mansion on Melba Highway built by Paul de Castella in 1854 from local hand-made bricks and marble and cedar brought overland from New South Wales, is open today with some alterations as the Chateau Yering Historic House/Hotel. Today the original dining room is a restaurant.

Yarra Valley Dairy, with 500 cattle and a range of cheeses, is located just off Melba Highway.

St Hubert&#x27;s, Domaine Chandon and Yeringberg are located to the east in neighbouring Coldstream. Lilydale Airport is located on McIntyre Lane. Also in Yering is Yering Range Vineyard and Windsor Park Equine Centre, a 247 hectare purpose-built horse agistment property. The Yering Gorge has some unique flora and is home to many native fauna species.

Since 2001 Yering Station has hosted the annual Yering Station Sculpture Awards. Finalist artworks are placed around the Yering Station property and the adjoining historical gardens of Chateau Yering. Previous finalists include Alex Sanson, Lloyd Godman, Jo Lane, and Csongvay Blackwood.

<doc id="611139" wikidata="Q959672" url="?curid=611139" title="Daybreak Game Company">
<text>Daybreak Game Company LLC is an American video game developer based in San Diego. The company was founded in December 1997 as Sony Online Entertainment, a subsidiary of Sony Computer Entertainment, but was spun off to an independent investor in February 2015 and renamed Daybreak Game Company. On December 1, 2020, Daybreak Game Company entered into an agreement to be acquired by Enad Global 7.

They are known for owning, maintaining, and creating additional content for the games &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, &quot;The Matrix Online&quot;, &quot;PlanetSide&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, &quot;Clone Wars Adventures&quot;, &quot;Free Realms&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, &quot;PlanetSide 2&quot;, &quot;H1Z1: Just Survive&quot;, and &quot;H1Z1: King of the Kill&quot;, along with more recent acquisitions &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, and &quot;Palia&quot;.

==History==
===Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (1997–2005)===

Sony Online Entertainment began with Sony Interactive Studios America (SISA), an internal game development studio of Sony, formed in 1995. In 1996, John Smedley was put in charge of SISA&#x27;s development of an online role-playing video game. The game would evolve into the MMORPG &quot;EverQuest&quot;. Smedley hired programmers Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover, who had come to Smedley&#x27;s attention through their work on the single-player role-playing game &quot;Warwizard&quot;.
In April 1998, Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) was formed by merging parts of Sony Online Ventures with Sony Pictures Entertainment. Within a matter of months after this change, Sony Interactive Studios America was renamed 989 Studios. Towards the end of 1998, 989 Studios shifted its strategy to making PlayStation games. The company&#x27;s video game and online development branch spun off; John Smedley, Brad McQuaid and Russell Shanks, as well as 55 other ex-989 employees, founded RedEye Interactive, later renamed Verant Interactive.

Verant Interactive launched &quot;EverQuest&quot; on March 16, 1999, through Sony with modest expectations. The game became successful. Sales continued rising at a steady rate until mid-2001 when growth slowed. Sony reported subscription numbers close to 450,000. In March 2000, Verant released &quot;EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark&quot;, the first in a long list of expansion packs for &quot;EverQuest&quot;.

In April 2000, Verant hired former &quot;Ultima Online&quot; developers Raph Koster and Rich Vogel. They formed an office in Austin, Texas, to develop &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; for LucasArts. SOE acquired Verant in June 2000, and eventually promoted Brad McQuaid to be its Chief Creative Officer. In October 2001, McQuaid resigned and founded Sigil Games Online, drawing many of the original developers of &quot;EverQuest&quot; from SOE.

Developed by Sony Online Entertainment, LucasArts released &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; in 2003, which saw rapid growth, as expected. Bruce Woodcock estimates that &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; reached nearly 300,000 subscribers within the year, before trailing off. LucasArts has released three expansions for &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, &quot;Jump to Lightspeed&quot; in October 2004, &quot;Rage of the Wookiees&quot; in May 2005, and &quot;Trials Of Obi-Wan&quot; in November 2005.

In 2003, the company also explored relatively untouched MMOG territory with the massively multiplayer online first-person shooter &quot;PlanetSide&quot; and the PlayStation 2 MMORPG &quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot;. &quot;PlanetSide&quot; enjoyed a reasonably successful launch, however it never attracted wide popularity. SOE released two expansions for &quot;PlanetSide&quot;, a retail product titled &quot;Core Combat&quot;, and &quot;Aftershock&quot;, a free expansion. &quot;EverQuest Online Adventures&quot; was not as successful, but it spawned an expansion, &quot;EverQuest Online Adventures Frontiers&quot;. The game was shut down on March 29, 2012, after nine years of operation.

&quot;EverQuest II&quot; was released on November 9, 2004. The sequel was set hundreds of years after the original. Similar in strategy to &quot;EverQuest&quot;, SOE has released several adventure packs and expansion packs for &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, starting with &quot;The Bloodline Chronicles&quot; in March 2005.

In January 2005, Sony Online Entertainment announced the creation of Station Publishing, a new label for distributing titles made by external developers. It was renamed Platform Publishing some time later, publishing titles such as &quot;Frantix&quot; and &quot;GripShift&quot;. In November 2005, SOE added the New Game Enhancements to &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, changing many of the game&#x27;s core mechanics. This upset players and critics, with the level of concurrent players reduced to around 10,000; relatively few for the MMO industry.

SOE has produced numerous &quot;EverQuest&quot; expansions and spin-off video games, including &quot;Champions of Norrath&quot; (for PlayStation 2) and &quot;Lords of EverQuest&quot; (Windows). They published &quot;&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Champions of Norrath&quot;, in February 2005. In August 2005, SOE entered a deal with Warner Bros. Entertainment which saw the acquisition and transition of &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; to the existing line up of SOE games.

===Sony Online Entertainment LLC (2006–2015)===

In April 2006, Sony Online Entertainment, Inc. became Sony Online Entertainment LLC, owned by Sony Pictures Digital and Sony Computer Entertainment America. In May 2006, it was announced that SOE would be co-publisher of &quot;&quot;. However, Sigil retained full development rights, and SOE&#x27;s role was only that of marketing, distribution, technical support, and hosting the game servers. SOE also announced the release of &quot;Field Commander&quot;, its third game for the PlayStation Portable System. In August 2006, SOE announced the acquisition of developer Worlds Apart Productions, renaming the studio SOE-Denver. The studio has since released an online version of the &quot;WizKids&quot; pirates constructible strategy game. In November 2006, SOE released its first PlayStation 3 title &quot;Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom&quot;, within the launch window of the PlayStation 3 system. SOE also released &quot;Pirates Online Constructible Strategy Game&quot;, the online version of the &quot;WizKids&quot; Pirates Constructible Strategy Game.

In January 2007, SOE announced that it has licensed rights from Midway Home Entertainment to develop and release six classic Midway games for PlayStation 3 download, including &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, &quot;Gauntlet II&quot;, &quot;Joust&quot;, &quot;Rampage World Tour&quot;, &quot;Rampart&quot;, and &quot;Championship Sprint&quot;. The games were available from the PlayStation Store. On May 15, 2007, Sony Online Entertainment announced that they had completed a transaction to purchase key assets from Sigil Games Online, including &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot; (described as Sigil&#x27;s &quot;tentpole property&quot;).

On March 13, 2008, Sony Online Entertainment announced that Sony Computer Entertainment will have direct control over SOE.

On January 16, 2009, the company joined Steam, selling &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; and &quot;Vanguard: Saga of Heroes&quot; via Steam. On the same day, the company purchased Pox Nora, an online turn-based strategy game. On August 1, 2009, SOE shut down &quot;The Matrix Online&quot; after 4 years of operation. Players were treated to about 2 months of gaming despite some initial setbacks that left many veteran players unable to access the game for about a week after the announcement was made. A memory book was developed and was made available for download on the game&#x27;s site.

, John Smedley was the CEO of Sony Online Entertainment. SOE is headquartered in San Diego, California, with additional game development studios located in Austin, Texas, Denver, Colorado and Seattle, Washington. On July 15, 2010, SOE eliminated 35 full-time positions and an undisclosed number of temporary positions to &quot;...better align the company&#x27;s resources...&quot; On August 8, 2010, SOE announced that &quot;EverQuest Next&quot; was in the early stages of development.

On January 7, 2011, SOE and Fastpoint Games announced the alpha launch of the Facebook game &quot;Fortune League&quot;. &quot;Fortune League&quot; integrates real-time performance data such as damages, deaths and healings directly from the massively multiplayer online game environment and uses them to form &quot;Hero Stats&quot; that drive the game. Therefore, player actions inside &quot;EverQuest II&quot; affected what happened in Fortune League, and prizes from Fortune League helped users advance in the &quot;EverQuest II&quot; environment. Fastpoint Games CEO, Kelly Perdew, positioned Fortune League as a new category of &quot;snackable&quot; data-driven games that would help MMO franchises acquire users and tap new revenue streams. On February 1, 2011, SOE unveiled new PlayStation Network games to be released throughout the year. These included &quot;Acceleration of Suguri X Edition&quot;, &quot;Akimi Village&quot;, &quot;Plants vs. Zombies&quot;, &quot;Rochard&quot;, &quot;Sideway&quot; and &quot;Slam Bolt Scrappers&quot;. On March 31, 2011, SOE confirmed that &quot;it will eliminate 205 positions and close its Denver, Seattle, and Tucson studios.&quot; Production of &quot;The Agency&quot; was also discontinued.

On December 6, 2011, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; switched to a free-to-play model, with optional subscriptions. On December 15, 2011, &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; was closed. SOE maintained a Memory Book for former players.

====Data breach====

On April 27, 2011, Sony, the parent company of SOE, released statements regarding an intrusion, on or about April 18, into the PlayStation Network, and the potential theft of up to 77 million subscribers&#x27; personal data. Sony maintains that PSN and SOE are hosted and run on completely separate subsystems and that the PlayStation Network intrusion had no major effect on SOE&#x27;s online services. SOE developers posted messages of concern and apology, but also assurances the SOE servers and systems were not compromised.

On May 2, 2011, SOE interrupted their online services. Players were told &quot;We have had to take the SOE service down temporarily. In the course of our investigation into the intrusion into our systems, we have discovered an issue that warrants enough concern for us to take the service down effective immediately. We will provide an update later today (Monday).&quot; Later, SOE disclosed that &quot;personal information from approximately 24.6 million SOE accounts may have been stolen&quot;, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, gender, date of birth, login ID, and hashed passwords.

===Daybreak Game Company (2015–present)===
On February 2, 2015, Sony announced that SOE had been sold to investment company Columbus Nova for an undisclosed amount and that it would be renamed Daybreak Game Company. Cutting its ties with Sony, Daybreak subsequently became able to develop their games for platforms other than PlayStation, including Xbox and mobile platforms. On February 11, employees of the company reported they were undergoing layoffs, including several senior developers and project managers. Shortly after, Daybreak responded by announcing the layoffs were intended to make the company profitable, but did not detail the extent of the layoffs or whether it would affect the development and support of their new and existing games. On July 22, 2015, Daybreak announced that John Smedley had stepped down as the company&#x27;s President, and that Russell Shanks, the company&#x27;s former COO, will take up his position. On August 21, 2015, Smedley left Daybreak to found a new company. In October 2016, Russell Shanks left Daybreak.

On December 19, 2016, it was announced that Daybreak games would become the new publisher of &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&quot;, taking over the role from Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. However, the two games would maintain their old account system and server centers, not integrating with the rest of Daybreak. The result of this deal would cause the closure of &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; and &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call 2: Fallen Kings&quot; on January 31, 2017.

In April 2018, Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian businessman and owner of portfolio company Renova Group, was sanctioned by the United States Department of the Treasury as part of an investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Columbus Nova had previously identified itself as an affiliate of Renova Group, while Renova Group had listed Columbus Nova as part of its corporate structure. Subsequently, it was believed that Columbus Nova, and consequently Daybreak, had also been affected by these sanctions. Daybreak subsequently began to deny that it had been sold to Columbus Nova, stating that the company had actually been acquired by Jason Epstein through his company Inception Acquisitions, LLC instead. At the time of the acquisition, Epstein had been a partner to Columbus Nova, though he left that company in 2017. A Daybreak spokesperson claimed that Epstein&#x27;s exact ties to Columbus Nova had caused confusion in media reporting of the sale, even though its deleted press release made the same claim. Columbus Nova also stated that it had never been owned by Renova Group, though Renova Group had been their largest client.

In September 2018, holding company NantWorks announced its strategic investment in Daybreak, and the resulting new venture in which the company will bring popular Daybreak games (including &quot;EverQuest&quot; and &quot;H1Z1&quot;) to mobile platforms. Three rounds of layoffs occurred between April 2018 and October 2019; the December rounds was estimated to have affected around 70 people. These layoffs were towards &quot;a realignment of the company into separate franchise teams, which will allow us to highlight their expertise, better showcase the games they work on, and ultimately provide tailored experiences for our players.&quot;
Following from the October 2019 round of layoffs, Daybreak announced in January 2020 that it would reorganize its internal structure to form three divisions: Dimensional Ink Games, Darkpaw Games, and Rogue Planet Games. Dimensional Ink became responsible for ongoing maintenance of &quot;DC Universe Online&quot; while working on a new MMO, Darkpaw to focus on the &quot;EverQuest&quot; franchise, and Rogue Planet to focus on &quot;PlanetSide 2&quot;.

In August 2020, it was announced that Daybreak would acquire Cold Iron Studios which was developing a PC and console game set in the &quot;Alien&quot; universe at the time. However, the deal never went through and the subsequent purchase of Daybreak by Enad Global 7 did not include Cold Iron Studios.

On December 1, 2020, it was reported that Daybreak Game Company would be acquired by Enad Global 7 for $300 million. The transaction was completed on December 22.

In December 2021, it was reported that Daybreak Game Company would be taking over development of &quot;&quot; in 2022. The transition to Daybreak Games servers was completed on October 18, 2022. 

In February 2024, &quot;less than 15&quot; employees were laid off from teams supporting Everquest, Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, DC Universe Online, and Lord of the Rings Online.

On July 1, 2024, Daybreak Game Company announced its acquisition of Palia developer Singularity 6.

==Station.com==
Sony Online Entertainment&#x27;s Station.com was a portal to its PC, console, casual and mobile games. Players could access and download games such as &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; and &quot;PlanetSide&quot;. Station.com also provided sneak previews to new games for Sony PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, including &quot;Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom&quot;. November 2006. In August 2006, Station.com added several games by Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment.

==ForgeLight engine==

The ForgeLight engine is a game engine developed by the company, and used for &quot;Free Realms&quot;, &quot;Clone Wars Adventures&quot;, &quot;PlanetSide 2&quot;, &quot;Landmark&quot;, &quot;EverQuest Next&quot;, &quot;Just Survive&quot;, and &quot;H1Z1&quot;. The engine is able to support up to 2,000 players on a single game server and allows over 200 players to be rendered by a game client at once.

<text>The University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) is a public university in Anchorage, Alaska, United States. UAA also administers four community campuses spread across Southcentral Alaska: Kenai Peninsula College, Kodiak College, Matanuska–Susitna College, and Prince William Sound College. Between the community campuses and the main Anchorage campus, roughly 15,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students are currently enrolled at UAA. It is Alaska&#x27;s largest institution of higher learning and the largest university in the University of Alaska System.

UAA&#x27;s main campus is located approximately southeast of its downtown area in the University-Medical District, adjacent to the Alaska Native Medical Center, Alaska Pacific University and Providence Alaska Medical Center. UAA is divided into five instructional and research units at the Anchorage campus: the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business and Public Policy, the Community and Technical College, College of Engineering, and the College of Health. UAA offers master&#x27;s degrees and graduate certificates in select programs, and the ability to complete certain PhD programs through cooperating universities through its Graduate Division. 

UAA is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. In 2019, UAA&#x27;s School of Education lost Initial Preparation specialized accreditation from the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). The school&#x27;s Advanced Preparation program successfully renewed CAEP-accreditation during annual review in 2021. As of May 2022, the School of Education has provisional approval from the Alaska Department of Education &amp; Early Development to offer a bachelor&#x27;s degree in early childhood education that leads to licensure.

==History==

In 1954, the Anchorage Community College (ACC) was founded and began offering evening classes to 414 students at Elmendorf Air Force Base. In 1962, the ACC, and other community colleges around the state were incorporated into the University of Alaska statewide system. Five years later, ACC began offering both day and evening classes at the main campus&#x27; current location in the University-Medical district. ACC provided academic study for associate degrees and the first two years of work toward baccalaureate degrees.

In the late 1960s, strong interest in establishing a four-year university in Anchorage brought about the birth of the University of Alaska, Anchorage Senior College (ASC). While ACC administered the lower division college, ASC administered upper division and graduate programs leading to baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degrees, as well as continuing education for professional programs. In 1971, the first commencement was held at West Anchorage High School, where 265 master&#x27;s, baccalaureate and associate degrees were awarded. ASC moved to the Consortium Library Building in 1973. The following year, when the first classroom and office facility was completed, daytime courses were offered for the first time. In 1977, ASC became a four-year university and was renamed the University of Alaska, Anchorage (UA,A). Ten years later, ACC and UA,A merged to become what is now known as the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA).

Since 1987, the university has continued to grow and expand. More than 200 programs, ranging from certificate programs to associate, baccalaureate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees, are offered at campuses in Anchorage and community campuses and extension centers throughout Southcentral Alaska. The university&#x27;s mission is to discover and disseminate knowledge through teaching, research, engagement and creative expression.

The University of Alaska Anchorage is an open-access university with roughly 17,000 students. In addition to thousands of students from across the state, the university retains a large commuter population from in and around Anchorage, many of whom are non-traditional or returning students. Nearly ten percent of the student population is from outside of Alaska or the United States. UAA also has the largest population of student veterans in the state.

==Academics==

===Alaska Native Studies===
A notable aspect of the curriculum offerings at UAA is the Alaska Native Studies program. All undergraduate students are now required to complete at least three credits in designated Alaska Native related academic courses to satisfy the new requirement. The new requirement is part of a broader effort to integrate knowledge about the diversity, perspectives and history of Alaska Native and Indigenous peoples into the university&#x27;s curriculum. In addition to courses on Alaska Native languages, history and literature, UAA also offers Alaska Native arts courses through the Fine Arts and Alaska Native studies programs, where students have the opportunity to learn traditional carving skills, drum making, bead work and other forms of indigenous knowledge. The Alaska Native Art Program focuses on the history, skills and traditions found in indigenous Alaskan art. Students learn techniques of harvesting and working with natural materials such as animal hide, wood, bone, and ivory for art making. The Native Arts studio is equipped with both traditional and modern tools. Visiting elders from all over Alaska teach techniques used to create objects that represent their cultural roots. All students regardless of background are encouraged to explore both traditional and experimental practices in order to find their personal form of expression.

===3+3 law school partnerships===
The University of Alaska Anchorage currently partners with the University of Washington School of Law and Willamette University College of Law in Salem, Oregon to provide qualified students with the opportunity to earn a baccalaureate degree and law degree on an accelerated schedule, typically in six years rather than the usual seven. These are often referred to as 3+3 programs or an Accelerated JD Program because students spend three years as undergraduates and three years in law school.

UAA&#x27;s athletic teams, known as the Seawolves, compete in 13 NCAA sports: men&#x27;s ice hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s skiing, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, women&#x27;s gymnastics, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor and outdoor track and field, and women&#x27;s volleyball. The university is an NCAA Division I school for gymnastics and ice hockey, and a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. UAA is a Division II member of the Great Northwest Athletic Conference in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track and field, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s outdoor track and field. Other conference affiliations are the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (gymnastics) and the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association.

Over the years, the Seawolves have produced multiple national champions in skiing and gymnastics as well as several NCAA Tournament bids in other sports.
UAA sports regularly received national television exposure thanks to the now-defunct Great Alaska Shootout basketball tournament, held at the Alaska Airlines Center. The Kendall Hockey Classic is one of the top preseason college hockey tournaments in the country, and the Seawolf volleyball team hosts some of the top Division II programs every September in the SpringHill Suites Invitational.

The Seawolves train and compete in some of Alaska&#x27;s top facilities, including the Sullivan Arena for hockey and the Alaska Airlines Center for volleyball, gymnastics and basketball. UAA&#x27;s alpine skiers take advantage of nearby Mount Alyeska, a world-class slope, while the Nordic skiers and cross-country runners use Anchorage&#x27;s intricate trail system to train in a recreational getaway. The 5,000 seat Alaska Airlines Center opened in September 2014, replacing the Wells Fargo Sports Complex as the home of UAA&#x27;s athletic department and programs.

Nearly every student in UAA&#x27;s residential community has their own private bedroom. Students have the option to live in Gender-Inclusive Housing; otherwise, students are housed consistent with their gender identity on the suite/apartment-level. 
UAA does not have a live-on requirement for students of any class standing. However, first-time, first-year students who choose to live on campus will automatically be placed in the First-Year Residential Experience Community.

===Student government===
The Union of Students of the University of Alaska Anchorage (USUAA) is the student governing body for the University of Alaska Anchorage. The President and Vice President are elected in the spring for one year terms.

The union has co-sponsored political debates in Anchorage, including a 2004 debate held at the university between Senatorial candidates Tony Knowles and Lisa Murkowski. In 2015, USUAA sponsored a Mayoral Debate in the Alaska Airlines Center, which was notable for its use of social media to connect and engage with the community.

USUAA also governs organizations that are created as a result of student ballot initiatives, such as the Concert Board and the Green Fee Board, which collect fees to enhance student life and provide services to students.

====Student media====
UAA has two primary sources of student-run media. Both media organizations are administered by paid student employees and governed by the Media Board, a USUAA organization. &quot;The Northern Light&quot; is a student newspaper printed every Tuesday with a wide coverage, ranging from school news, sports, community events, and entertainment reviews.

==Environmental concerns==

Since 2007, locals have been concerned by a re-occurring smell which has been regularly engulfing the town, impacting upon the amenity and health of local residents and visitors. It had been described by some as resembling a burning chemical gas smell, the stench of dead bodies or as a putrid smell that was able to infiltrate homes. The smell was found to originate from the Drovers Place area where Transpacific Industries, a leading organic waste recycler, was based. The business has since closed. Concerns over the rapid pace of urban expansion in the Pakenham area have also been raised, as traditional farmland surrounding the town has been rezoned to allow for the development of housing estates, causing protests by some residents who have sought to have these undeveloped or &#x27;green wedge&#x27; lands protected.

<doc id="611162" wikidata="Q957684" url="?curid=611162" title="Coalwood, West Virginia">
<text>Coalwood is an unincorporated coal town in McDowell County, West Virginia, United States. The coal mine in Coalwood reached its peak in the 1950s and ceased production on October 1, 1986. As of the 1990 census—the last time the town was counted separately—the population was 900. The town is the setting of Homer Hickam&#x27;s best-selling 1998 memoir &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;, as well as its 1999 film adaptation, &quot;October Sky&quot;.
==History==
Coalwood was founded by George Lafayette Carter in 1905. He came on the back of a mule and eventually found rich seams of coal, and bought 20,000 acres (80 km). He constructed a mine, calling it the Carter Coal Company and built offices, houses, a schoolhouse, the Carter Coal Company Store, a church and more. Carter hired a dentist and doctor to provide service to his miners.

In 1922, Carter sold the mine and properties within the town to the Consolidation Coal Company. The company rebuilt the community and recruited new employees to work in the mines, but Carter regained the company when Consolidation Coal defaulted on its payments in 1933. Carter died in 1936, and the company was then taken over by his son James who sold it in 1947 to a group of industrialists who changed the company name to the Olga Coal Company.

In 1956, the Coalwood mine was connected underground to the nearby Caretta mine which was also owned by Olga. In 1959, Olga ceased bringing coal to the surface via Coalwood which prompted the Norfolk and Western Railway to begin pulling up the tracks leading to and from Coalwood.

The Coalwood-Caretta mine continued to be productive throughout most of the 20th century, producing on average one million tons annually until the mine was finally closed.

At its peak, Coalwood had a population of over 2,000.

In 1980, the Olga Coal Company was bought by the LTV Corporation which closed Coalwood&#x27;s mine in 1986.

As of 2019, much of Coalwood sits abandoned, including Big Creek High School. The buildings of the town still stand, although time and the elements have taken their toll. A primary school has been built at the former site of Big Creek High School.

==October Sky Festival==
Once a year, in October, Coalwood hosted an &quot;October Sky&quot; festival in honor of the accomplishments of the &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;. Many scientists and astronauts attended and Homer Hickam always made an appearance. The 2007 festival also represented the 50th anniversary of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite to go into orbit around the Earth. Commemorating both events, an actor from the movie &quot;October Sky&quot;, Scott Miles, attended the festival to sign autographs. 

On February 7, 2012, the Cape Coalwood Restoration Association announced that the October 2011 festival, the 13th October Sky Festival, had been the last October Sky Festival. After the cancellation of the Rocket Boys/October Sky Festival was announced, Hickam was approached by a group of concerned Raleigh County citizens to inquire to the possibility of bringing the festival to their city. After weeks of conversations between the parties it was agreed that the 2012 Rocket Boys/October Sky Festival would be held in Beckley with many events taking place on the grounds of the Exhibition Coal Mine at New River Park on October 5–7. 

The Rocket Boys Festival remained an annual event in Beckley from 2012 to 2019, which was the last festival in Beckley. The 2020 festival was cancelled due to COVID-19.

<text>Bruce McDonald (born May 28, 1959) is a Canadian film and television director, writer, and producer. Born in Kingston, Ontario, he rose to prominence in the 1980s as part of the loosely-affiliated Toronto New Wave.

McDonald has since directed more than a dozen features films over the course of his four-decade-long filmmaking career. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; has called him an &quot;iconoclastic filmmaker&quot;. Several of his films, ranging from mockumentaries to horror films, have attracted cult followings.

His most notable films include &quot;Roadkill&quot; (1989), &quot;Highway 61&quot; (1991), &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; (1996), &quot;Pontypool&quot; (2008), &quot;Trigger&quot; (2010), and &quot;Hellions&quot; (2015). &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; has been frequently ranked amongst the greatest movies ever to come out of Canada.

==Early life==
McDonald was born in Kingston, Ontario, and later moved to Toronto, where he graduated from film school at Ryerson University. At Ryerson, he made the short films &quot;Merge&quot; (1980) and &quot;Let Me See...&quot; (1982), the latter of which won the Norman Jewison Award for best student film at the 1982 Canadian National Exhibition and screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. Jewison has mentored McDonald throughout his career.

== Career ==

=== 1980s–1990s ===
McDonald began his filmmaking career in the 1980s. He started out production assistant and driver, and was an assistant cameraman and editor on films by Atom Egoyan, Ron Mann, Peter Mettler, and Amnon Buchbinder.

His feature-length directorial debut, &quot;Roadkill&quot;, won the award for Best Canadian Film at the Toronto International Film Festival and McDonald earned some notoriety and media attention when he quipped, while accepting his $25,000 prize from TIFF for &quot;Roadkill&quot;, that he planned to spend the money on &quot;a big chunk of hash&quot;.

&quot;Roadkill&quot; was the first of a trilogy of road movies—including &quot;Highway 61&quot; (1991) and &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; (1996)—the film launched his reputation as a maverick independent. &quot;Roadkill&quot; was a success with audiences and critics. &quot;Highway 61&quot; (1991) was named Best Canadian Feature at the Vancouver International Film Festival and won awards at festivals in Brussels and San Sebastiàn. In 1996, &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; won the award for Best Canadian Feature at Sudbury&#x27;s Cinefest and at the Vancouver International Film Festival, marking his second win at the latter.

&quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; has been frequently ranked amongst the greatest movies ever to come out of Canada, and is considered to be McDonald&#x27;s breakthrough film. The film won the Genie Award for Best Achievement in Music — Original Song for the track &quot;Who the Hell Do You Think You Are?&quot; and was nominated for five other awards including Best Film and Best Direction. It won the Best Canadian Feature at the Sudbury Cinéfest and, at the Vancouver International Film Festival, it received the $10,000 CITY-TV award for Best Canadian Film, with Baker winning the Rogers prize for Best Canadian Screenplay.

=== 2000s–2010s ===
Since the late 1990s, McDonald has directed dozens of film and television productions. His 2006 film, &quot;The Tracey Fragments&quot;, premiered at the 57th Berlin International Film Festival, where it was awarded the Manfred Salzgeber Prize for innovative filmmaking. &quot;The Tracey Fragments&quot; was chosen as one of the top 10 best Canadian films of 2007 by Toronto International Film Festival. He then directed the horror film &quot;Pontypool&quot;, which was also selected as one of the top 10 best Canadian films of the year, this time 2008, by the Toronto International Film Festival.

In 2009, McDonald directed three short films for the cross-platform project City Sonic. McDonald, along with six other directors, shot 20 short films about Toronto musicians and the places where their musical lives were transformed. McDonald directed films starring Die Mannequin, the Cancer Bats, and Geddy Lee of Rush.

His 2010 film &quot;Trigger&quot; was the first film ever screened at Toronto&#x27;s new TIFF Bell Lightbox. The film was originally planned in the late 1990s as a companion film to McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;, which would have starred Hugh Dillon and Callum Keith Rennie. However, work on the film remained dormant until McDonald and screenwriter Daniel MacIvor decided to rewrite their original screenplay to be about two women instead; these roles were ultimately played by Tracy Wright and Molly Parker. Wright, who McDonald had frequently worked with throughout his career, was undergoing treatment for pancreatic cancer during the film&#x27;s production. It was the last film she completed before her death.

&quot;This Movie Is Broken&quot;, a concert film on Broken Social Scene was released on June 25, 2010.

&quot;Hard Core Logo 2&quot; premiered at the Whistler Film Festival on December 4, 2010, with the members of Die Mannequin and McDonald walking the red carpet. Expectations were set high for Bruce McDonald when he released the second instalment of &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot;. This caused the film to receive mixed reviews; Postmedia News wrote that it is a film about &quot;artistic inspiration, maintaining a pure creative heart and connecting with others through honest expression&quot; while &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; referred to the feature as giving the audience &quot;no sense of urgency, desire, or necessity&quot; to continue watching.

In 2011, he produced the documentary television series &quot;Yonge Street: Toronto Rock &amp; Roll Stories&quot;, focusing on the history of the Yonge Street music scene in Toronto in the 1960s, for Bravo.

In 2014, he directed the horror thriller &quot;Hellions&quot; (2015) starring Chloe Rose, which premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival and later screened at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival. His subsequent film &quot;Weirdos&quot;, was released in 2016.

=== 2020s ===
McDonald&#x27;s most recent feature film is &quot;Dreamland&quot;, which was released on June 5, 2020.

== Reception ==
Early in his career, he was referred to as a &quot;bad boy&quot; of Canadian cinema. Several of his films, ranging from mockumentaries to horror films, have attracted cult followings.

&quot;Variety&quot; described his films as containing a &quot;mash up humor with adventure, music, or horror&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; has called him an &quot;iconoclastic filmmaker&quot;.

==Personal life==
McDonald currently resides in Toronto with his wife, Dany Chiasson, who works as a cinematographer and filmmaker, and their daughter.

<text>Berwick () is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Casey local government area. Berwick recorded a population of 50,298 at the 2021 census.

It was named by an early leaseholder, Robert Gardiner, after his birthplace, Berwick-on-Tweed in Northumberland.

==History==

The town of Berwick was originally part of the Cardinia Creek run. Subdivision started in 1854 and a store, post office, hotel and other businesses were established. Wheat, barley and potatoes were grown, with a flour mill operating for several years. Dairy farming and cheese making later became the main activities. The Berwick Agricultural Society, originally started in 1848 as the Mornington Farmers&#x27; Society, is one of the oldest farmers&#x27; societies in Victoria.

The area grew with the construction of a coach road between Melbourne and the Gippsland region, and the Post Office opening on 18 September 1858.

A quarry opened in 1859 to supply ballast for the railway line along the same route, which opened in 1877, and a spur line was constructed to Berwick railway station to transport the metal. The site of the quarry is now occupied by Wilson Botanic Park. From 1861 until 1902, Berwick was also the headquarters of the Shire of Berwick, originally formed as the Berwick Roads Board.

Poplar trees lining the High Street and on into Beaconsfield were planted as an Avenue of Honour to commemorate the fallen in the First World War. Originally name plaques were supposed to have been mounted at the foot of each tree but this was never carried out, despite the plaques being produced.

Late in the 20th century Melbourne sprawled eastward to Berwick. The surrounding rural land was subdivided becoming a popular destination for first home buyers with the population exploding with new housing developments from the 1990s to the 2000s. Some of the character of the original township has remained.

== Demographics ==
In the 2016 Census, there were 47,674 people in Berwick. 65.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.6%, India 3.5%, Sri Lanka 3.1%, China 2.0% and New Zealand 1.8%. 73.3% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 3.0%, Sinhalese 2.8%, Hindi 1.0%, Italian 0.9% and Arabic 0.9%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 29.3%, Catholic 25.8% and Anglican 10.6%.

Berwick&#x27;s census populations have been 60 (1861), 636 (1891), 887 (1954), 25,461, (2001), 36,420 (2006), 44,779 (2011) and 47,674 (2016).

==Education==

The town&#x27;s first school, Berwick Primary, was originally established in an old shepherd&#x27;s hut near the old Berwick hospital in 1857. It was the first school in the south eastern 
area and school number 40 in Victoria. School buildings were later built on a parcel of land abutting Lyall Rd, between Peel Street and Brisbane Street. The school operated from this site until 2003 when a new school was built in Fairholme Boulevard. Subsequently, the Peel Street site was redeveloped as Pioneer Park, a community open space. The original school buildings were retained during the redevelopment and now operate as a restaurant. Berwick Primary is the only school in Berwick that is using the International Baccalaureate Curriculum.

As well as the State School, a Boys&#x27; Grammar School operated from 1882 to 1922. St Margaret&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School (originally called Berwick Presbyterian Girls&#x27; School) opened in 1920 with Junior boys being admitted during the 1960s. It ceased providing boarding placement in 1978, being one of the first of the St Margaret&#x27;s Schools in the world to change.
Berwick Secondary College and Kambrya College, public high schools, and the Berwick campuses of Beaconhills College and St. Francis Xavier College are located in the suburb of Berwick, Victoria. Timbarra P-9 College is located on Parkhill Dr in the Timbarra estate of Berwick.

Victoria&#x27;s first academically selective co-educational secondary school, Nossal High School, opened in 2010, and is located on the Federation University campus.

Berwick is also home to the third campus of Haileybury, Melbourne, Victoria, with the campus having been simply named &#x27;Edrington&#x27;. Berwick Lodge Primary School also opened up in 1990, in the suburb. Berwick Fields Primary School opened in 2006 and has an estimated total of 925 students in May 2019, and around March 2012, the total exceeded 1,000 students. Brentwood Park Primary school is located on Bermersyde Drive, adjacent to Kambrya College. 

Chisholm Institute provides TAFE courses and degrees for domestic and international students, with a Technical Education Centre opening in 2009. Chisholm Berwick also run the Casey Tech School, a shared learning facility that delivers programs to secondary schools in the region.

In 2017, Federation University moved into the former Monash University and is located at 100 Clyde Rd, Berwick on the former Casey Airfields. The university offers on campus accommodation and other facilities to students, such as a library and cafe. The main areas of study at the Berwick campus are nursing and allied health, IT, education and business.

==Facilities==

===Retail===
In Berwick are three major local shopping precincts, Berwick Village, Eden Rise Village and Parkhill Plaza. Alongside these are two smaller precincts, Clock Tower Mews and Alira Village. Centred on High Street is Berwick Village, which contains many small shops and businesses, as well as two shopping centres, Berwick Marketplace, which opened on 8 November 1998 with a Safeway (now Woolworths) supermarket and a number of specialty stores, and Berwick Southside, which was opened on 21 November 1994 and redeveloped during the mid-2010s, now a standalone Coles supermarket.

Eden Rise Village is on the corner of Clyde and O&#x27;Shea Roads and includes a Coles supermarket, Aldi supermarket, Nando&#x27;s, Uncle Bucks and various other specialty stores.

Parkhill Plaza is situated on the corner of Parkhill Drive and Ernst Wanke Road and contains a Coles supermarket and some specialty stores.

Clock Tower Mews is located on Bemersyde Drive, adjacent to Kambrya College. A FoodWorks supermarket was previously present in the precinct, but has since been replaced by a locally owned store known as FoodMart.

Alira Village is the &quot;town centre&quot; of the new Alira housing estate, on the corner of Homestead and Centre Roads. The precinct includes an IGA supermarket.

===Medical===
Berwick currently has 2 hospitals, Casey Public Hospital which is in the process of being extended, with a second St. John of God Berwick Private Hospital, opposite Casey Hospital on Kangan Drive. There is also a St. John of God mental rehabilitation centre on Gloucester Avenue. 

There are other clinics in the suburb making it mostly self sufficient for all medical needs of the residents.

==Transport==
Berwick has a railway station and bus terminus situated immediately to the east of Clyde Road. There is also a multi-storey car park for commuters, as much of the old car park was taken to build the new bus interchange. Berwick railway station is a zone 2 station, that receives regular electrified metro services connecting the suburb to the Pakenham line&#x27;s terminus — East Pakenham, and the greater metro network via Caulfield, South Yarra, Richmond, and the City Loop. There is one up (set down only) and one down (pick up only) service provided by V/Line directly connecting the suburb to the inner Gippsland terminus of Traralgon. Due to a restricted bus infrastructure, Berwick is a fairly car-dependant suburb, with 77.7% of people using a car to travel to work, compared to the Victorian average of 68.3%. The Princes Freeway, carrying traffic between Geelong, Melbourne and Gippsland, runs through Berwick with exits at O&#x27;Shea Road, Clyde Road and Princes Highway, where the eastern section of the Princes Freeway becomes the Monash Freeway. Work began in late 2020 to remove the level crossing on Clyde Road. This work was completed and Clyde Road was re-opened to the public with the new underpass on 21/02/2021 after being closed for access for one month prior so that the vehicle underpass could be completed. 

==Sport==

The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Mornington Peninsula Nepean Football League and an Association football team called Berwick City Football Club.

The town also has a successful cricket club known as the &quot;Wickers&quot; and later changed to the Berwick Bears that compete in the DDCA competition and a tennis club that competes in the Berwick &amp; District Tennis Association.

There is the Montuna Golf Club at Guys Hill approximately 5 km from Berwick Village.

There is also Little Athletics at Edwin Flack Reserve.

Berwick Badminton is open to the public for those who are interested in the sport.

The Berwick Leisure Centre is a space inside of the Berwick Secondary College grounds, at which there are gymnastics running, as well as a trampolining program. Often, there are other activities, such as karate.

The Hallam Cobras Softball Club Inc have club rooms at Sweeney Reserve, Melzak Way, Berwick

==Media==

Berwick is in the coverage range of all the commercial radio stations in Melbourne, yet is also locally serviced by 94.3 Star FM, whose studios are situated in Warragul.

==Notable residents==

The Berwick Mechanics&#x27; Institute and Free Library was built in 1862 at the corner of Peel and Edward Streets. In return for a nominal rent Robert Bain agreed, in 1878, to lease a block of his land to the library for 500 years, so long as a library remained on the property for that period. In 1880 it was moved to its present site in the main street and extended the following year.

Berwick was also the home of Edwin &quot;Teddy&quot; Flack, Australia&#x27;s first Olympian and Olympic gold medal winner ( and ) at the inaugural Athens Olympic Games. He was laid to rest in Berwick Cemetery, and is commemorated by a statue in the main street. The &quot;Edwin Flack Reserve&quot; includes several sporting grounds, such as the Edwin Flack Oval, Edwin Flack Athletics Track and Edwin Flack Netball Courts, all named in his honour. They are located alongside Berwick Secondary College.

Richard Casey, later Baron Casey of Berwick and Governor-General of Australia was a resident of Berwick. His home of Edrington has now been converted to an aged care facility.

Scott McDonald, Australian International football (soccer) player, striker for Celtic FC in Scotland and top scorer in the Scottish Premier League in the 2007–08 season grew up in Berwick.

Former AFL games record holder Michael Tuck and former Hawthorn defender Mark Graham hail from Berwick as does 2009 number one draft pick Tom Scully and Brisbane Lions ruckman Stefan Martin and Defender and Coach, Justin Leppitsch (2014-2016), Assistant Coach to Richmond (2016-Present).

<doc id="611177" wikidata="Q407189" url="?curid=611177" title="Perchlorate">
<text>A perchlorate is a chemical compound containing the perchlorate ion, , the conjugate base of perchloric acid (ionic perchlorate). As counterions, there can be metal cations, quaternary ammonium cations or other ions, for example, nitronium cation ().

The term &quot;perchlorate&quot; can also describe perchlorate esters or covalent perchlorates. These are organic compounds that are alkyl or aryl esters of perchloric acid. They are characterized by a covalent bond between an oxygen atom of the ClO4 moiety and an organyl group.

In most ionic perchlorates, the cation is non-coordinating. The majority of ionic perchlorates are commercially produced salts commonly used as oxidizers for pyrotechnic devices and for their ability to control static electricity in food packaging. Additionally, they have been used in rocket propellants, fertilizers, and as bleaching agents in the paper and textile industries.

Perchlorate contamination of food and water endangers human health, primarily affecting the thyroid gland.

Ionic perchlorates are typically colorless solids that exhibit good solubility in water. The perchlorate ion forms when they dissolve in water, dissociating into ions.  Many perchlorate salts also exhibit good solubility in non-aqueous solvents. Four perchlorates are of primary commercial interest: ammonium perchlorate , perchloric acid , potassium perchlorate and sodium perchlorate .

==Production==
Very few chemical oxidants are strong enough to convert chlorate to perchlorate. Persulfate, ozone, or lead dioxide are all known to do so, but the reactions are too delicate and low-yielding for commercial viability. 

Perchlorate salts are typically manufactured through the process of electrolysis, which involves oxidizing aqueous solutions of corresponding chlorates. This technique is commonly employed in the production of sodium perchlorate, which finds widespread use as a key ingredient in rocket fuel. Perchlorate salts are also commonly produced by reacting perchloric acid with bases, such as ammonium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide. Ammonium perchlorate, which is highly valued, can also be produced via an electrochemical process. 

Perchlorate esters are formed in the presence of a nucleophilic catalyst via a perchlorate salt&#x27;s nucleophilic substitution onto an alkylating agent.

==Uses==
* The dominant use of perchlorates is as oxidizers in propellants for rockets, fireworks and highway flares. Of particular value is ammonium perchlorate composite propellant as a component of solid rocket fuel. In a related but smaller application, perchlorates are used extensively within the pyrotechnics industry and in certain munitions and for the manufacture of matches. Martian perchlorates might also be used to produce fuel on that planet.
* Perchlorate is used to control static electricity in food packaging. Sprayed onto containers it stops statically charged food from clinging to plastic or paper/cardboard surface.
* Niche uses include lithium perchlorate, which decomposes exothermically to produce oxygen, useful in oxygen &quot;candles&quot; on spacecraft, submarines, and in other situations where a reliable backup oxygen supply is needed. 
* Potassium perchlorate has, in the past, been used therapeutically to help manage Graves&#x27; disease. It impedes production of the thyroid hormones that contain iodine.
* As perchlorate is generally a non-complexing anion and that its sodium salts is particularly soluble, it is commonly used as a background, or supporting, electrolyte in solution chemistry, electrophoresis, and electrochemistry. Although used as a powerful oxidizer in propulsive powders and explosives, quite surprisingly, the perchlorate anion is a weak oxidant in aqueous solution because of kinetics limitations severely hindering the electron transfer.

==Chemical properties==
The perchlorate ion is the least redox reactive of the generalized chlorates. Perchlorate contains chlorine in its highest oxidation number (+7). A table of reduction potentials of the four chlorates shows that, contrary to expectation, perchlorate in aqueous solution is the weakest oxidant among the four.

These data show that the perchlorate and chlorate are stronger oxidizers in acidic conditions than in basic conditions.

Gas phase measurements of heats of reaction (which allow computation of Δf&quot;H&quot;°) of various chlorine oxides do follow the expected trend wherein  exhibits the largest endothermic value of Δf&quot;H&quot;° (238.1 kJ/mol) while  exhibits the lowest endothermic value of Δf&quot;H&quot;° (80.3 kJ/mol).

===Weak base and weak coordinating anion===
As perchloric acid is one of the strongest mineral acids, perchlorate is a weak base in the sense of Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory. 
As it is also generally a weakly coordinating anion, perchlorate is commonly used as a background, or supporting, electrolyte. 

===Weak oxidant in aqueous solution due to kinetic limitations===

Perchlorate compounds oxidize organic compounds, especially when the mixture is heated. The explosive decomposition of ammonium perchlorate is catalyzed by metals and heat.

As perchlorate is a weak Lewis base (&quot;i.e.&quot;, a weak electron pair donor) and a weak nucleophilic anion, it is also a very weakly coordinating anion. This is why it is often used as a supporting electrolyte to study the complexation and the chemical speciation of many cations in aqueous solution or in electroanalytical methods (voltammetry, electrophoresis…). Although the perchlorate reduction is thermodynamically favorable , and that is expected to be a strong oxidant, most often in aqueous solution, it is practically an inert species behaving as an extremely slow oxidant because of severe kinetics limitations. The metastable character of perchlorate in the presence of reducing cations such as in solution is due to the difficulty to form an activated complex facilitating the electron transfer and the exchange of oxo groups in the opposite direction. These strongly hydrated cations cannot form a sufficiently stable coordination bridge with one of the four oxo groups of the perchlorate anion. Although thermodynamically a mild reductant, ion exhibits a stronger trend to remain coordinated by water molecules to form the corresponding hexa-aquo complex in solution. The high activation energy of the cation binding with perchlorate to form a transient inner sphere complex more favourable to electron transfer considerably hinders the redox reaction. The redox reaction rate is limited by the formation of a favorable activated complex involving an oxo-bridge between the perchlorate anion and the metallic cation. It depends on the molecular orbital rearrangement (HOMO and LUMO orbitals) necessary for a fast oxygen atom transfer (OAT) and the associated electron transfer as studied experimentally by Henry Taube (1983 Nobel Prize in Chemistry) and theoretically by Rudolph A. Marcus (1992 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), both awarded for their respective works on the mechanisms of electron-transfer reactions with metal complexes and in chemical systems. 

In contrast to the cations which remain unoxidized in deaerated perchlorate aqueous solutions free of dissolved oxygen, other cations such as Ru(II) and Ti(III) can form a more stable bridge between the metal centre and one of the oxo groups of . In the inner sphere electron transfer mechanism to observe the perchlorate reduction, the anion must quickly transfer an oxygen atom to the reducing cation. When it is the case, metallic cations can readily reduce perchlorate in solution. Ru(II) can reduce to , while V(II), V(III), Mo(III), Cr(II) and Ti(III) can reduce to .
Some metal complexes, especially those of rhenium, and some metalloenzymes can catalyze the reduction of perchlorate under mild conditions. Perchlorate reductase (see below), a molybdoenzyme, also catalyzes the reduction of perchlorate. Both the Re- and Mo-based catalysts operate via metal-oxo intermediates.

===Microbiology===
Over 40 phylogenetically and metabolically diverse microorganisms capable of growth using perchlorate as an electron acceptor have been isolated since 1996. Most originate from the Pseudomonadota, but others include the Bacillota, &quot;Moorella perchloratireducens&quot; and &quot;Sporomusa&quot; sp., and the archaeon &quot;Archaeoglobus fulgidus&quot;. With the exception of &quot;A. fulgidus&quot;, microbes that grow via perchlorate reduction utilize the enzymes perchlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase, which collectively take perchlorate to chloride. In the process, free oxygen () is generated.

==Natural abundance==
===Terrestrial abundance===
Perchlorate is created by lightning discharges in the presence of chloride. Perchlorate has been detected in rain and snow samples from Florida and Lubbock, Texas. It is also present in Martian soil.

Naturally occurring perchlorate at its most abundant can be found commingled with deposits of sodium nitrate in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. These deposits have been heavily mined as sources for nitrate-based fertilizers. Chilean nitrate is in fact estimated to be the source of around of perchlorate imported to the U.S. (1909–1997). Results from surveys of ground water, ice, and relatively unperturbed deserts have been used to estimate a &quot;global inventory&quot; of natural perchlorate presently on Earth.

===On Mars===

Perchlorate was detected in Martian soil at the level of ~0.6% by weight. It was shown that at the Phoenix landing site it was present as a mixture of 60% and 40% . These salts, formed from perchlorates, act as antifreeze and substantially lower the freezing point of water. Based on the temperature and pressure conditions on present-day Mars at the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander site, conditions would allow a perchlorate salt solution to be stable in liquid form for a few hours each day during the summer.

The possibility that the perchlorate was a contaminant brought from Earth was eliminated by several lines of evidence. The &quot;Phoenix&quot; retro-rockets used ultra pure hydrazine and launch propellants consisting of ammonium perchlorate or ammonium nitrate. Sensors on board &quot;Phoenix&quot; found no traces of ammonium nitrate, and thus the nitrate in the quantities present in all three soil samples is indigenous to the Martian soil. Perchlorate is widespread in Martian soils at concentrations between 0.5 and 1%. At such concentrations, perchlorate could be an important source of oxygen, but it could also become a critical chemical hazard to astronauts.

In 2006, a mechanism was proposed for the formation of perchlorates that is particularly relevant to the discovery of perchlorate at the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander site. It was shown that soils with high concentrations of chloride converted to perchlorate in the presence of titanium dioxide and sunlight/ultraviolet light. The conversion was reproduced in the lab using chloride-rich soils from Death Valley. Other experiments have demonstrated that the formation of perchlorate is associated with wide band gap semiconducting oxides. In 2014, it was shown that perchlorate and chlorate can be produced from chloride minerals under Martian conditions via UV using only NaCl and silicate.

Further findings of perchlorate and chlorate in the Martian meteorite EETA79001 and by the Mars &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover in 2012-2013 support the notion that perchlorates are globally distributed throughout the Martian surface. With concentrations approaching 0.5% and exceeding toxic levels on Martian soil, Martian perchlorates would present a serious challenge to human settlement, as well as microorganisms. On the other hand, the perchlorate would provide a convenient source of oxygen for the settlements.

On September 28, 2015, NASA announced that analyses of spectral data from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars instrument (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter from four different locations where recurring slope lineae (RSL) are present found evidence for hydrated salts. The hydrated salts most consistent with the spectral absorption features are magnesium perchlorate, magnesium chlorate and sodium perchlorate. The findings strongly support the hypothesis that RSL form as a result of contemporary water activity on Mars.

==Contamination in environment==
Perchlorates are of concern because of uncertainties about toxicity and health effects at low levels in drinking water, impact on ecosystems, and indirect exposure pathways for humans due to accumulation in vegetables. They are water-soluble, exceedingly mobile in aqueous systems, and can persist for many decades under typical groundwater and surface water conditions.

===Industrial origin===
Perchlorates are used mostly in rocket propellants but also in disinfectants, bleaching agents, and herbicides. Perchlorate contamination is caused during both the manufacture and ignition of rockets and fireworks. Fireworks are also a source of perchlorate in lakes. Removal and recovery methods of these compounds from explosives and rocket propellants include high-pressure water washout, which generates aqueous ammonium perchlorate.

===In U.S. drinking water===
In 2000, perchlorate contamination beneath the former flare manufacturing plant Olin Corporation Flare Facility, Morgan Hill, California was first discovered several years after the plant had closed. The plant had used potassium perchlorate as one of the ingredients during its 40 years of operation. By late 2003, the State of California and the Santa Clara Valley Water District had confirmed a groundwater plume currently extending over nine miles through residential and agricultural communities.
The California Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Santa Clara Valley Water District have engaged in a major outreach effort, a water well testing program has been underway for about 1,200 residential, municipal, and agricultural wells. Large ion exchange treatment units are operating in three public water supply systems which include seven municipal wells with perchlorate detection. The potentially responsible parties, Olin Corporation and Standard Fuse Incorporated, have been supplying bottled water to nearly 800 households with private wells, and the Regional Water Quality Control Board has been overseeing cleanup efforts.

The source of perchlorate in California was mainly attributed to two manufacturers in the southeast portion of the Las Vegas Valley in Nevada, where perchlorate has been produced for industrial use. This led to perchlorate release into Lake Mead in Nevada and the Colorado River which affected regions of Nevada, California and Arizona, where water from this reservoir is used for consumption, irrigation and recreation for approximately half the population of these states. Lake Mead has been attributed as the source of 90% of the perchlorate in Southern Nevada&#x27;s drinking water. Based on sampling, perchlorate has been affecting 20 million people, with highest detection in Texas, southern California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts, but intensive sampling of the Great Plains and other middle state regions may lead to revised estimates with additional affected regions. An action level of 18 μg/L has been adopted by several affected states.

In 2001, the chemical was detected at levels as high as 5 μg/L at Joint Base Cape Cod (formerly Massachusetts Military Reservation), over the Massachusetts then state regulation of 2 μg/L.

As of 2009, low levels of perchlorate had been detected in both drinking water and groundwater in 26 states in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

===In food===
In 2004, the chemical was found in cow&#x27;s milk in California at an average level of 1.3 parts per billion (ppb, or μg/L), which may have entered the cows through feeding on crops exposed to water containing perchlorates.
A 2005 study suggested human breast milk had an average of 10.5 μg/L of perchlorate.

===From minerals and other natural occurrences===
In some places, there is no clear source of perchlorate, and it may be naturally occurring. Natural perchlorate on Earth was first identified in terrestrial nitrate deposits /fertilizers of the Atacama Desert in Chile as early as the 1880s and for a long time considered a unique perchlorate source. The perchlorate released from historic use of Chilean nitrate based fertilizer which the U.S.imported by the hundreds of tons in the early 19th century can still be found in some groundwater sources of the United States, for example Long Island, New York. Recent improvements in analytical sensitivity using ion chromatography based techniques have revealed a more widespread presence of natural perchlorate, particularly in subsoils of Southwest USA, salt evaporites in California and Nevada, Pleistocene groundwater in New Mexico, and even present in extremely remote places such as Antarctica. The data from these studies and others indicate that natural perchlorate is globally deposited on Earth with the subsequent accumulation and transport governed by the local hydrologic conditions.

Despite its importance to environmental contamination, the specific source and processes involved in natural perchlorate production remain poorly understood. Laboratory experiments in conjunction with isotopic studies have implied that perchlorate may be produced on earth by oxidation of chlorine species through pathways involving ozone or its photochemical products. Other studies have suggested that perchlorate can also be formed by lightning activated oxidation of chloride aerosols (e.g., chloride in sea salt sprays), and ultraviolet or thermal oxidation of chlorine (e.g., bleach solutions used in swimming pools) in water.

===From nitrate fertilizers===
Although perchlorate as an environmental contaminant is usually associated with the manufacture, storage, and testing of solid rocket motors, contamination of perchlorate has been focused as a side effect of the use of natural nitrate fertilizer and its release into ground water. The use of naturally contaminated nitrate fertilizer contributes to the infiltration of perchlorate anions into the ground water and threaten the water supplies of many regions in the US.

One of the main sources of perchlorate contamination from natural nitrate fertilizer use was found to come from the fertilizer derived from Chilean caliche (calcium carbonate), because Chile has rich source of naturally occurring perchlorate anion. Perchlorate concentration was the highest in Chilean nitrate, ranging from 3.3 to 3.98%. Perchlorate in the solid fertilizer ranged from 0.7 to 2.0 mg g−1, variation of less than a factor of 3 and it is estimated that sodium nitrate fertilizers derived from Chilean caliche contain approximately 0.5–2 mg g−1 of perchlorate anion. The direct ecological effect of perchlorate is not well known; its impact can be influenced by factors including rainfall and irrigation, dilution, natural attenuation, soil adsorption, and bioavailability. Quantification of perchlorate concentrations in nitrate fertilizer components via ion chromatography revealed that in horticultural fertilizer components contained perchlorate ranging between 0.1 and 0.46%.

==Environmental cleanup==
There have been many attempts to eliminate perchlorate contamination. Current remediation technologies for perchlorate have downsides of high costs and difficulty in operation. Thus, there have been interests in developing systems that would offer economic and green alternatives.

===Treatment ex situ and in situ===
Several technologies can remove perchlorate, via treatments ex situ (away from the location) and in situ (at the location).

Ex situ treatments include ion exchange using perchlorate-selective or nitrite-specific resins, bioremediation using packed-bed or fluidized-bed bioreactors, and membrane technologies via electrodialysis and reverse osmosis. In ex situ treatment via ion exchange, contaminants are attracted and adhere to the ion exchange resin because such resins and ions of contaminants have opposite charge. As the ion of the contaminant adheres to the resin, another charged ion is expelled into the water being treated, in which then ion is exchanged for the contaminant. Ion exchange technology has advantages of being well-suitable for perchlorate treatment and high volume throughput but has a downside that it does not treat chlorinated solvents. In addition, ex situ technology of liquid phase carbon adsorption is employed, where granular activated carbon (GAC) is used to eliminate low levels of perchlorate and pretreatment may be required in arranging GAC for perchlorate elimination.

In situ treatments, such as bioremediation via perchlorate-selective microbes and permeable reactive barrier, are also being used to treat perchlorate. In situ bioremediation has advantages of minimal above-ground infrastructure and its ability to treat chlorinated solvents, perchlorate, nitrate, and RDX simultaneously. However, it has a downside that it may negatively affect secondary water quality. In situ technology of phytoremediation could also be utilized, even though perchlorate phytoremediation mechanism is not fully founded yet.

Bioremediation using perchlorate-reducing bacteria, which reduce perchlorate ions to harmless chloride, has also been proposed.

== Health effects ==

===Thyroid inhibition===
Perchlorate is a potent competitive inhibitor of the thyroid sodium-iodide symporter. Thus, it has been used to treat hyperthyroidism since the 1950s. At very high doses (70,000–300,000 ppb) the administration of potassium perchlorate was considered the standard of care in the United States, and remains the approved pharmacologic intervention for many countries.
In large amounts perchlorate interferes with iodine uptake into the thyroid gland. In adults, the thyroid gland helps regulate the metabolism by releasing hormones, while in children, the thyroid helps in proper development. The NAS, in its 2005 report, &quot;Health Implications of Perchlorate Ingestion&quot;, emphasized that this effect, also known as Iodide Uptake Inhibition (IUI) is not an adverse health effect. However, in January 2008, California&#x27;s Department of Toxic Substances Control stated that perchlorate is becoming a serious threat to human health and water resources. In 2010, the EPA&#x27;s Office of the Inspector General determined that the agency&#x27;s own perchlorate reference dose (RfD) of 24.5 parts per billion protects against all human biological effects from exposure, as the federal government is responsible for all US military base groundwater contamination. This finding was due to a significant shift in policy at the EPA in basing its risk assessment on non-adverse effects such as IUI instead of adverse effects. The Office of the Inspector General also found that because the EPA&#x27;s perchlorate reference dose is conservative and protective of human health further reducing perchlorate exposure below the reference dose does not effectively lower risk.

Because of ammonium perchlorate&#x27;s adverse effects upon children, Massachusetts set its maximum allowed limit of ammonium perchlorate in drinking water at 2 parts per billion (2 ppb = 2 micrograms per liter).

Perchlorate affects only thyroid hormone. Because it is neither stored nor metabolized, effects of perchlorate on the thyroid gland are reversible, though effects on brain development from lack of thyroid hormone in fetuses, newborns, and children are not.

Toxic effects of perchlorate have been studied in a survey of industrial plant workers who had been exposed to perchlorate, compared to a control group of other industrial plant workers who had no known exposure to perchlorate. After undergoing multiple tests, workers exposed to perchlorate were found to have a significant systolic blood pressure rise compared to the workers who were not exposed to perchlorate, as well as a significant decreased thyroid function compared to the control workers.

A study involving healthy adult volunteers determined that at levels above 0.007 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/(kg·d)), perchlorate can temporarily inhibit the thyroid gland&#x27;s ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream (&quot;iodide uptake inhibition&quot;, thus perchlorate is a known goitrogen). The EPA converted this dose into a reference dose of 0.0007 mg/(kg·d) by dividing this level by the standard intraspecies uncertainty factor of 10. The agency then calculated a &quot;drinking water equivalent level&quot; of 24.5 ppb by assuming a person weighs and consumes of drinking water per day over a lifetime.

In 2006, a study reported a statistical association between environmental levels of perchlorate and changes in thyroid hormones of women with low iodine. The study authors were careful to point out that hormone levels in all the study subjects remained within normal ranges. The authors also indicated that they did not originally normalize their findings for creatinine, which would have essentially accounted for fluctuations in the concentrations of one-time urine samples like those used in this study. When the Blount research was re-analyzed with the creatinine adjustment made, the study population limited to women of reproductive age, and results not shown in the original analysis, any remaining association between the results and perchlorate intake disappeared. Soon after the revised Blount Study was released, Robert Utiger, a doctor with the Harvard Institute of Medicine, testified before the US Congress and stated: &quot;I continue to believe that that reference dose, 0.007 milligrams per kilo (24.5 ppb), which includes a factor of 10 to protect those who might be more vulnerable, is quite adequate.&quot;

In 2014, a study was published, showing that environmental exposure to perchlorate in pregnant women with hypothyroidism is associated with a significant risk of low IQ in their children.

===Lung toxicity===
Some studies suggest that perchlorate has pulmonary toxic effects as well. Studies have been performed on rabbits where perchlorate has been injected into the trachea. The lung tissue was removed and analyzed, and it was found that perchlorate injected lung tissue showed several adverse effects when compared to the control group that had been intratracheally injected with saline. Adverse effects included inflammatory infiltrates, alveolar collapse, subpleural thickening, and lymphocyte proliferation.

===Aplastic anemia===
In the early 1960s, potassium perchlorate used to treat Graves&#x27; disease was implicated in the development of aplastic anemia—a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce new blood cells in sufficient quantity—in thirteen patients, seven of whom died. Subsequent investigations have indicated the connection between administration of potassium perchlorate and development of aplastic anemia to be &quot;equivocable at best&quot;, which means that the benefit of treatment, if it is the only known treatment, outweighs the risk, and it appeared a contaminant poisoned the 13.

==Regulation in the U.S.==

===Water===
In 1998, perchlorate was included in the U.S. EPA Contaminant Candidate List, primarily due to its detection in California drinking water.

In 2002, the EPA completed its draft toxicological review of perchlorate and proposed an reference dose of 0.00003 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/kg/day) based primarily on studies that identified neurodevelopmental deficits in rat pups. These deficits were linked to maternal exposure to perchlorate.

In 2003, a federal district court in California found that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act applied, because perchlorate is ignitable, and therefore was a &quot;characteristic&quot; hazardous waste.

Subsequently, the U.S. National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reviewed the health implications of perchlorate, and in 2005 proposed a much higher reference dose of 0.0007 mg/kg/day based primarily on a 2002 study by Greer &quot;et al.&quot; During that study, 37 adult human subjects were split into four exposure groups exposed to 0.007 (7 subjects), 0.02 (10 subjects), 0.1 (10 subjects), and 0.5 (10 subjects) mg/kg/day. Significant decreases in iodide uptake were found in the three highest exposure groups. Iodide uptake was not significantly reduced in the lowest exposed group, but four of the seven subjects in this group experienced inhibited iodide uptake. In 2005, the RfD proposed by NAS was accepted by EPA and added to its integrated risk information system (IRIS).

# The NAS report described the level of lowest exposure from Greer &quot;et al.&quot; as a &quot;no-observed-effect level&quot; (NOEL). However, there was actually an effect at that level although not statistically significant largely due to small size of study population (four of seven subjects showed a slight decrease in iodide uptake).
# Reduced iodide uptake was not considered to be an adverse effect, even though it is a precursor to an adverse effect, hypothyroidism. Therefore, additional safety factors, would be necessary when extrapolating from the point of departure to the RfD.
# Consideration of data uncertainty was insufficient because the Greer, &quot;et al.&quot; study reflected only a 14-day exposure (=acute) to healthy adults and no additional safety factors were considered to protect sensitive subpopulations like for example, breastfeeding newborns.

Although there has generally been consensus with the Greer &quot;et al.&quot; study, there has been no consensus with regard to developing a perchlorate RfD. One of the key differences results from how the point of departure is viewed (i.e., NOEL or &quot;lowest-observed-adverse-effect level&quot;, LOAEL), or whether a benchmark dose should be used to derive the RfD. Defining the point of departure as a NOEL or LOAEL has implications when it comes to applying appropriate safety factors to the point of departure to derive the RfD.

In early 2006, EPA issued a &quot;Cleanup Guidance&quot; and recommended a Drinking Water Equivalent Level (DWEL) for perchlorate of 24.5 μg/L. Both DWEL and Cleanup Guidance were based on a 2005 review of the existing research by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Lacking a federal drinking water standard, several states subsequently published their own standards for perchlorate including Massachusetts in 2006 and California in 2007. Other states, including Arizona, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, and Texas have established non-enforceable, advisory levels for perchlorate.

In 2008, EPA issued an interim drinking water health advisory for perchlorate and with it a guidance and analysis concerning the impacts on the environment and drinking water. California also issued guidance regarding perchlorate use. Both the Department of Defense and some environmental groups voiced questions about the NAS report, but no credible science has emerged to challenge the NAS findings.

In February 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that U.S. toddlers on average were being exposed to more than half of EPA&#x27;s safe dose from food alone. In March 2009, a Centers for Disease Control study found 15 brands of infant formula contaminated with perchlorate and that combined with existing perchlorate drinking water contamination, infants could be at risk for perchlorate exposure above the levels considered safe by EPA.

In 2010, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection set a 10 fold lower RfD (0.07 μg/kg/day) than the NAS RfD using a much higher uncertainty factor of 100. They also calculated an Infant drinking water value, which neither US EPA nor CalEPA had done.

On February 11, 2011, EPA determined that perchlorate meets the Safe Drinking Water Act criteria for regulation as a contaminant. The agency found that perchlorate may have an adverse effect on the health of persons and is known to occur in public water systems with a frequency and at levels that it presents a public health concern. Since then EPA has continued to determine what level of contamination is appropriate. EPA prepared extensive responses to submitted public comments.

In 2016, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a lawsuit to accelerate EPA&#x27;s regulation of perchlorate.

In 2019, EPA proposed a Maximum Contaminant Level of 0.056 mg/L for public water systems.

On June 18, 2020, EPA announced that it was withdrawing its 2011 regulatory determination and its 2019 proposal, stating that it had taken &quot;proactive steps&quot; with state and local governments to address perchlorate contamination. In September 2020 NRDC filed suit against EPA for its failure to regulate perchlorate, and stated that 26 million people may be affected by perchlorate in their drinking water. On March 31, 2022, the EPA announced that a review confirmed its 2020 decision. Following the NRDC lawsuit, in 2023 the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit ordered EPA to develop a perchlorate standard for public water systems. EPA stated that it will publish a proposed standard for perchlorate in 2025, and issue a final rule in 2027.

==Covalent perchlorates==
Although typically found as a non-coordinating anion, a few metal complexes are known. Hexaperchloratoaluminate and tetraperchloratoaluminate are strong oxidising agents.

Several perchlorate esters are known. For example, methyl perchlorate is a high energy material that is a strong alkylating agent. Chlorine perchlorate is a covalent inorganic analog.

==Safety==
As discussed above, iodide is competitor in the thyroid glads. In the presence of reductants, perchlorate forms potentially explosive mixtures. The PEPCON disaster destroyed a production plant for ammonium perchlorate when a fire caused the ammonium perchlorate stored on site to react with the aluminum that the storage tanks were constructed with and explode.

<text>The Saint Louis River (abbreviated St. Louis River) is a river in the U.S. states of Minnesota and Wisconsin that flows into Lake Superior. The largest U.S. river to flow into the lake, it is in length and starts east of Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota. The river&#x27;s watershed covers . Near the Twin Ports of Duluth, Minnesota and Superior, Wisconsin, the river becomes a freshwater estuary. 

== History ==

According to Warren Upham, the Ojibwe name of the river is &quot;Gichigami-ziibi&quot; (Great-lake River). He notes:
&quot;The river was probably so named by Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye (1685–1749), who was a very active explorer, in the years 1731 and onward. Shortly before his death the king of France in 1749 conferred on him the cross of Saint Louis as a recognition of the importance of his discoveries, and thence the name of the Saint Louis River appears to have come. On Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin&#x27;s map (1688) and Philippe Buache&#x27;s map (1754), it is called the Rivière du Fond du Lac, and the map by Gilles Robert de Vaugondy (1755) and Jonathan Carver&#x27;s map (1778) is the earliest to give the present name.&quot;

The river was a vital link connecting the Mississippi River waterways to the west with the Great Lakes to the east. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the St. Louis River competed with the St. Croix River as a candidate for a canal linking the Mississippi River with the Great Lakes. The US Army Corps of Engineers ultimately concluded in 1913 that such a canal would be &quot;inadvisable, infeasible, and impractical&quot;.

Jay Cooke State Park is located near the mouth of the river and is the site of a canoe portage used by Native Americans, European explorers, fur traders, Voyageurs, coureurs des bois, and missionaries of the 18th and 19th centuries. It was a rough trail of steep hills and swamps that began at the foot of the rapids above the neighborhood of Fond du Lac (&quot;bottom of the lake&quot;) and climbed some to the present-day city of Carlton. Above Carlton, travelers proceeded upstream and continued on to Lake Vermillion and the Rainy River. Or they may have traveled southwest up the East Savanna River, portaged the grueling 6-mile long Savanna Portage (now a state park), and then paddled on to the Mississippi River.

==Pollution==
 
By the mid 20th century, the lower Saint Louis River became one of the most heavily polluted waterways in the state. Holling Clancy Holling, in his 1941 book &quot;Paddle-to-the-Sea&quot;, illustrated the polluted state of the Saint Louis River. In 1987, the river became a designated Area of Concern, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency as a result of significant sediment contamination and habitat loss (see next section).

The Western Lake Superior Sanitary District (WLSSD) was established in 1971 to address serious pollution problems in the lower Saint Louis River Basin. WLSSD&#x27;s regional wastewater treatment plant began operating in 1978. Within two years, fish populations rebounded and anglers began returning to the river.

In 2013 the State of Minnesota ended a project intended to research the mercury problem in the river. The cooperating agencies, including Wisconsin DNR and the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, did not agree to end the study. In 2024, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency began the process to develop a St. Louis River Watershed Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load, with a goal of obtaining EPA approval in 2027. High levels of mercury in fish tissue have resulted in the issuance of fish consumption guidance by the Minnesota Department of Health.

===Saint Louis River AOC===
The St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC) is one of 43 AOCs across the Great Lakes designated under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement in 1987. It is a bi-state (Minnesota and Wisconsin) AOC. The AOC boundary includes the lower of the St. Louis River, from upstream of Cloquet, Minnesota, to its mouth at the Duluth/Superior Harbor and Lake Superior, and the Nemadji River watershed. Draining of watershed and encompassing a area, the St. Louis River is the second largest U.S.-based AOC. As the largest tributary to Lake Superior, the St. Louis River is vital to the regional economy and encompasses the Port of Duluth-Superior, an essential port for Great Lakes shipping.

Historical industrial use of the river, before the onset of modern environmental laws, has resulted in the degradation of habitat and sediments contaminated with: mercury, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and other toxins. Pollutants in the AOC are also due to: historical discharges, Superfund sites, discharges from wastewater and from landfills, and other point-source discharges within the AOC.

An impairment of beneficial uses means a change in the chemical, physical or biological integrity of the Great Lakes system sufficient to cause significant environmental degradation. A 1992 Remedial Action Plan determined that nine &quot;beneficial use impairments&quot; existed in the AOC including:

* Fish Consumption Advisories
* Degraded Fish and Wildlife Populations (removed in 2023)
* Fish Tumors and Other Deformities (removed in 2019)
* Degradation of Benthos
* Restrictions on Dredging
* Excessive Loading of Sediment and Nutrients (removed in 2020)
* Beach Closings and Body Contact Restrictions
* Degradation of Aesthetics (removed in 2014)
* Loss of Fish and Wildlife Habitat

As shown above, some of these impairments have already been removed. Once all nine Beneficial Use Impairments have been removed, application can be made for delisting, which means the ecological benefits of the St. Louis River have been restored to an acceptable level.

==Recreation==

The river is fished for walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, black crappie, and channel catfish populations. Other species of rough fish include Shorthead Redhorse and White Sucker. The river is frequented by those traveling the Minnesota DNR Saint Louis River Water Trail, which has campsites and angling.

Attempts to introduce sturgeon are underway by restoring habitat, stocking the fish, and monitoring their movements. While native to the river at one time, overfishing and pollution nearly wiped them out many years ago. In 1983 the DNR, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and others began rebuilding spawning habitat and introducing baby sturgeon into the river. In 2016 MPR reported, &quot;Slowly, steadily, numbers increased as the stocked fish took hold in the river. Five years ago, tribal biologists found their first fry from naturally reproducing sturgeon, a sign that a healthy fish population could grow on its own. Minnesota even began allowing catch-and-release fishing last year.&quot;

The Saint Louis River Trail Association is planning the construction of a long-distance hiking trail along more than half the length of the river. Construction of the first 36-mile segment began in early 2012, with cooperation from the Minnesota DNR; the trail association hopes to have this section completed in 2015.

<doc id="611183" wikidata="Q515301" url="?curid=611183" title="Courier (typeface)">
<text>Courier is a monospaced slab serif typeface commissioned by IBM and designed by Howard &quot;Bud&quot; Kettler (1919–1999) in the mid-1950s. The Courier name and typeface concept are in the public domain. Courier has been adapted for use as a computer font, and versions of it are installed on most desktop computers.

==History==
IBM did not trademark the name Courier, so the typeface design concept and its name are now public domain. According to some sources, a later version for IBM&#x27;s Selectric typewriters was developed with input from Adrian Frutiger, although Paul Shaw writes that this is a confusion with Frutiger&#x27;s adaptation of his Univers typeface for the Selectric system. Sources differ on whether the design was published in 1955 or 1956.

As a monospaced font, in the 1990s Courier found renewed use in the electronic world in situations where columns of characters must be consistently aligned, for instance, in computer programming. It has also become an industry standard for all screenplays to be written in 12-point Courier or a close variant. Twelve-point Courier New was also the U.S. State Department&#x27;s standard typeface until January 2004, when it was replaced with 14-point Times New Roman. Reasons for the change included the desire for a more &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;legible&quot; font.

Kettler was once quoted about how the name was chosen. The font was nearly released with the name &quot;Messenger&quot;. After giving it some thought, Kettler said, &quot;A letter can be just an ordinary messenger, or it can be the courier, which radiates dignity, prestige, and stability.&quot;

==Variants==

=== Code variants ===
With the rise of digital computing, variants of the Courier typeface were developed with features helpful in coding: larger punctuation marks, stronger distinctions between similar characters (such as the numeral &quot;0&quot; vs. the upper-case &quot;O&quot; and the numeral &quot;1&quot; vs. the lower-case &quot;L&quot;), sans-serif variants, and other features to provide increased legibility when viewed on screens. Today, many Courier typefaces include a code version within the type family. Courier New Baltic, Courier New CE, Courier New Cyr, Courier New Greek, Courier New Tur are aliases created in the codice_1 section of WIN.INI. These entries all point to the master font. When an alias font is specified, the font&#x27;s character map contains a different character set from the master font and the other alias fonts.

=== IBM Courier ===
IBM made Courier freely available in PostScript Type 1 format. Known as &quot;IBM Courier&quot; or simply &quot;Courier&quot;, it is available under the IBM/MIT X Consortium Courier Typefont agreement. Among other IBM-specific characters it contains optionally a dotted zero (which seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 display controllers) and a slashed zero.

=== Courier 10 Pitch BT and Courier Code ===
 The Courier 10 Pitch BT typeface was released as a font by Bitstream. Courier 10 BT is heavier than Courier New and more closely approximates the look of the original Courier type on paper. The freely available version, often seen as a system font on electronic devices, includes the 255 characters of the ANSI character set in Type 1 format. Courier 10 BT has been donated to the X Consortium by Bitstream (along with Bitstream Charter) and is the default Courier font on most Linux distributions. Expanded Pan-European (W1G) character sets are made available for license by Bitstream.

Courier Code is a variant of Courier 10 Pitch BT for use in programming. The zero is dotted to better distinguish it from the capital &quot;O&quot; and the lowercase &quot;L&quot; has been altered to better distinguish it from the number one. The leading has been increased slightly as well.

=== Courier New ===
Courier New appears as a system font on many electronic devices. This Courier variant was produced for electronic use by Monotype. Its thin appearance when printed on paper owes to its being &quot;digitized directly from the golf ball of the IBM Selectric&quot; without accounting for the visual weight normally added by the typewriter&#x27;s ink ribbon. ClearType rendering technology includes a hack to make the font appear more legible on screens, though printouts retain the thin look. The font family includes Courier New, Courier New Bold, Courier New Italic, and Courier New Bold Italic.

Courier New was introduced as a system font with Windows 3.1, which also included raster Courier fonts. The fonts were also sold commercially by Ascender Corporation. The Ascender fonts have &#x27;WGL&#x27; at the end of the font name, and cover only the WGL characters.

Courier New features higher line space than Courier. Punctuation marks were reworked to make the dots and commas heavier. Versions from 2.76 onward include Hebrew and Arabic glyphs, with most of the Arabic characters added on non-italic fonts. The styling of Arabic glyphs is similar to those found in Times New Roman but adjusted for monospace. The Courier New version 5.00 includes over 3100 glyphs, covering over 2700 characters per font.

=== Courier Prime ===

This Courier typeface, developed by Alan Dague-Greene with funding from John August and Quote-Unquote Apps, includes a true Italic style. Courier Prime matches the metrics of Courier Final Draft, with some design changes and improvements aimed at greater legibility and beauty. The typeface was released in January 2013 under the SIL Open Font License. In 2016 the family was extended with Sans Serif and Code versions. By mid-2018 the family included Semi-Bold and Medium versions (designed by M. Babek Aliassa) and a Cyrillic alphabet version (designed by Ivan Gladkikh). All fonts in the family are downloadable for free and can be used in any application.

=== Courier Screenplay ===
A typeface developed for Fade In Professional Screenwriting Software, Courier Screenplay is designed to offer the legibility of Courier 10 BT with the line counts favoured by screenwriters. The font is downloadable for free independent of the software and can be used in any application. The typeface provides the ANSI 255 character map used in Western European languages.

=== Courier Final Draft ===
Courier Final Draft is a version of Courier 10 BT developed for the Final Draft screenwriting program. The installed font can be used in any application. Default settings in the program yield 55 lines per page.
=== Dark Courier ===
Dark Courier is a normal-weight typeface rather than a semi-bold or bold as its name may imply. Dark Courier, developed as a TrueType font by HP, was one of the first fonts developed as a Courier New alternative for those who found that typeface too thin.

=== Courier Standard ===

Courier Standard, Courier Standard Bold, Courier Standard Bold Italic, Courier Standard Italic are fonts distributed with Adobe Reader 6, as a replacement for the PostScript Courier fonts. The stroke terminators are flat instead of round. The typeface contains code pages 1252, Windows OEM Character Set. The font is Hinted and Smoothed for all point sizes. It contains OpenType layout tables aalt, dlig, frac, ordn, sups for Default Language in Latin script; dlig for TUR language in Latin script. Each font contains 374 glyphs.

=== Nimbus Mono L ===
URW++ produced a version of Courier called Nimbus Mono L in 1984, and eventually released under the GPL and AFPL (as Type 1 font for Ghostscript) in 1996. It is one of the Ghostscript fonts, free alternatives to 35 core PostScript fonts, which include Courier. It is available in major free and open source operating systems.
*Tex Gyre Cursor, developed by GUST (&quot;the Polish TeX Users Group&quot;), is based on the URW Nimbus Mono L typeface.
*FreeMono, a free font descending from URW++ Nimbus Mono L, which, in turn, descends from Courier. It is one of free fonts developed in GNU FreeFont project, first published in 2002. It is used in some free software as a Courier replacement or for Courier font substitution.

=== Fonts-TLWG ===

Thai Linux Working Group publish several typefaces as free and open-source software monospace. 4 of those typefaces contain Courier glyphs: TlwgMono, Tlwg Typewriter, Tlwg Typist and Tlwg Typo.

==Alternatives and derivatives==
Many monospaced typefaces used as alternatives to Courier in coding are sans-serif fonts for on-screen legibility.
*Liberation Mono is a sans-serif font metrically equivalent to Courier New, developed by Ascender Corp. and published by Red Hat in 2007 under the GPL license with some exceptions. It is used in some Linux distributions as default font replacement for Courier New.
*Cousine Croscore font, also by Ascender and basically the same as Liberation Mono 2.0

==Applications==

===In Latin 1 text===
Courier is commonly used in ASCII art because it is a monospaced font and is available almost universally. &quot;Solid-style&quot; ASCII art uses the darkness/lightness of each character to portray an object, which can be quantified in pixels (here in 12-point size):

===In computer programming===
Courier, as a common monospaced font, is often used to signify source code.

<text>Clyde is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 48 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Casey local government area. Clyde recorded a population of 11,177 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Clyde Post Office on the Berwick-Cranbourne Road opened on 25 January 1864. In 1915 it was renamed Clyde North, and Clyde Railway Station office (open since 1888) was renamed Clyde.

==Description==

The town centre is located in a small triangle between Twyford Road, Clyde-Five Ways Road and Ballarto Road and contains a primary school, CFA fire station, general store and community hall. Nearby are the Inghams poultry feed mill, built in 1979, and Lineham Oval, a sports oval which is home to the Clyde club in the West Gippsland Cricket Association.

==Transport==
Clyde railway station was formerly situated on the South Gippsland railway corridor that operated to its terminus at Yarram in the early 1980s and Leongatha in the mid-1990s. A V/Line road coach service replaced the rail service to Leongatha on 24 July 1993, running between Melbourne and Yarram. However, since the closure of the South Gippsland rail line—with the exception of the locally run tourist railway between Nyora and Leongatha—by the Kennett Victorian government on 14 December 1994, the South and West Gippsland Transport Group represented by the local council are campaigning for the rail services to be reinstated beyond the current terminus at Cranbourne by the 2020s, which was promised by the Bracks government in 1999.

On 31 January 2018, a council in Melbourne&#x27;s booming South-east says it needs almost $3 Billion worth of rail and road infrastructure to bring its transport services including the electrification to Clyde from Cranbourne.

<doc id="611189" wikidata="Q3492824" url="?curid=611189" title="Central Security Service">
<text>The Central Security Service (CSS) is a combat support agency of the United States Department of Defense which was established in 1972 to integrate the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Service Cryptologic Components (SCC) of the United States Armed Forces in the field of signals intelligence, cryptology, and information assurance at the tactical level. In 2002, the CSS had approximately 25,000 uniformed members. It is part of the United States Intelligence Community.

== History ==
After World War II ended, the United States had two military organizations for the collection of signals intelligence (SIGINT): the Army Security Agency (ASA) and the Naval Communications Intelligence Organization (OP-20-G). The latter was deactivated and reorganized into the much smaller Communications Support Activities (CSA) in 1946, leaving ASA as the main SIGINT agency. Additionally, the United States Air Force established its own US Air Force Security Service (USAFSS) for the collection of communications intelligence in 1948.

On May 20, 1949, the Secretary of Defense created the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA), which became responsible for the direction and control of all US communications intelligence (COMINT) and communications security (COMSEC) activities. However, at the tactical level these tasks continued to be performed by the respective army, navy, and air force agencies, which were not willing to accept the authority of the newly created AFSA. In trying to get control over the military SIGINT elements, AFSA was replaced by the new and more powerful National Security Agency (NSA) on October 24, 1952.

Tactical military intelligence was traditionally collected by specialized soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and coast guardsmen deployed around the world. For example, during the Vietnam War, each of the military services deployed its own cryptologic units, supported by the NSA, which set up a number of SIGINT Support Groups (SSGs) as merging points for signal intelligence. With increasing cryptologic requirements, the military SIGINT systems had to be updated and unified and therefore it was planned to integrate NSA and the Service Cryptologic Agencies (SCAs) into a new unified command, with NSA absorbing SCA functions.

According to James Bamford, NSA/CSS was initially conceived as a separate &quot;fourth department&quot; beside the three that make up the Department of Defense. The latter resisted this idea, and therefore the CSS was founded as an inter-service organization. The Central Security Service was established by Presidential Directive in February 1972 to promote full partnership between the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Service Cryptologic Elements (SCEs) of the armed forces.

The new NSA/CSS solution increased performance standards and training and was the foundation for further centralization of NSA and the various military cryptologic elements and capabilities.

== Structure ==
The Chief of the Central Security Service (CH/CSS) is the Director of the National Security Agency (DIRNSA), who also serves as Commander of the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM), and is the highest-ranking military official of these organizations. The current Chief of the CSS is General Timothy D. Haugh, USAF.

A function specific for the CSS is that of Deputy Chief CSS (DCH/CSS), who is the principal advisor on military cryptologic issues to the Director of NSA in his role as Chief of CSS. The Deputy Chief oversees the military cryptology system and manages the partnerships between NSA/CSS and the Service Cryptologic Elements. He also ensures military capabilities to fulfill the National Cryptologic Strategy. The current Deputy Chief of the CSS is Brig. Gen. D. Scott George, USAF.

===Current members===
The Central Security Service comprises the following Service Cryptologic Components:

* U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM, formerly U.S. Army Security Agency) 
* Marine Cryptologic Support Battalion (MCSB)
* U.S. Fleet Cyber Command (formerly Naval Security Group)
* Sixteenth Air Force (formerly Twenty-Fifth Air Force, and AFISRA)
* United States Space Force intelligence
* Coast Guard Intelligence (CGI)

These Service Cryptologic Components consist of a range of subordinate units for specific tasks, stationed both domestically and overseas. INSCOM has over 15 brigades, groups and centers with presence at over 180 locations worldwide; MCSB consists of seven companies, five of which are in the continental US, one in Hawaii and one in England; and AFISRA has five major wings and four supported ones with about 17,000 people at 65 locations worldwide.

== Tasks ==
For all SIGINT-related activities, these military intelligence and security organizations are part of the Central Security Service and therefore subordinate to the Director of NSA in his role as Chief of the CSS. For administrative matters and logistic support, these cryptologic organizations are part of their respective parent service of the United States Armed Forces. Other SIGINT-related units and resources from the military can be subordinated to the Chief of the CSS by the Secretary of Defense with the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The day-to-day work of the CSS is to capture enemy signals (radar, telemetry, radio/satellite communications) using the means of the involved service. For example, the Navy has special submarines for tapping undersea cables; the Air Force operates aircraft with sophisticated antennas and processing gear to listen to enemy radar and radio; and on the ground, the Army operates similar eavesdropping equipment.

== Emblem ==

After its creation, the CSS had no emblem of its own for many years, so in 1996, a seal for the Central Security Service was created upon request of NSA Director Kenneth A. Minihan. The blue background of the CSS emblem represents &quot;fidelity&quot; and &quot;steadfastness&quot;, with the symbols for the cryptologic service elements provided shown clockwise from top right as follows: Army Intelligence and Security Command, Marine Corps Intelligence, Naval Security Group, Coast Guard Intelligence and Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency with the symbol of the NSA in the center.

The seal was updated in 2022 to display all six of the Service Cryptologic Components, which are the United States Fleet Cyber Command, the United States Marine Corps Director of Intelligence, the United States Army&#x27;s Intelligence and Security Command, the 16th Air Force representing both United States Air Force and United States Space Force services, and the US Coast Guard Deputy Assistant Commandant for Intelligence. Each are equally balanced around a six point star on which is centered the symbol of NSA/CSS, who provides the funding, direction, and guidance to all of America&#x27;s SIGINT activities.

<text>Clyde North is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 46 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Casey local government area. Clyde North recorded a population of 31,681 at the 2021 census.

==History==

It was named after the Clyde Creek, a watercourse between two early pastoral runs. The stream flowed eastwards to the Koo Wee Rup Swamp about 6 km away. It is thought that the name was inspired by the Clyde River, Scotland.

Clyde Post Office opened on 25 January 1864. In 1915 it was renamed Clyde North, when Clyde Railway Station office was renamed Clyde.

==Today==

The area to the west of Berwick-Cranbourne Road is mostly within the Urban Growth Boundary, with a residential development known as &quot;Cascades On Clyde&quot; and several others, under construction, having begun in late 2007.

Parks Victoria are also investigating the creation of a new regional park, on land bounded by Berwick-Cranbourne and Thompson Roads.

The area of Clyde North to the east of the newly built suburban area, roughly 1 kilometre east of Berwick-Cranbourne Road, is classed as Green wedge land, is distinctly rural in nature, and is outside of the main growth corridor. The land is used in this area for a mixture of market gardening (notably around Pattersons Road) and dairy farming. The land is mainly flat, and most of the roads in the area are dirt roads maintained by the City of Casey.

A new lifestyle centre was recently opened in late 2019, with a Bunnings Warehouse as the first store, followed by a few others, and now contains an Aldi supermarket.

== Education ==
=== Public schools ===
The public schools located in Clyde North are Grayling Primary School, Ramlegh Park Primary School, Topirum Primary School, Wilandra Rise Primary School, as well as the upcoming Clyde North Secondary School (interim name) opening in 2025 for Year 7 students and Thompsons West Primary School (interim name) opening in 2025. The Victorian Government is currently building new public primary and secondary schools, as options (especially for secondary education) are currently scarce for Clyde North residents. 

=== Private schools ===
The Catholic and independent schools located in Clyde North are Hillcrest Christian College, Rivercrest Christian College, and Clyde Grammar (open to Prep to Year 2 students). Some families transport their children to private schools in neighbouring suburbs as well, such as Berwick.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Berwick-Cranbourne Road (which continues on to be known as Clyde Road in the suburb of Berwick) is the major arterial road for the suburb of Clyde North. Other major roads include Soldiers Road, which serves the Berwick Waters estate, Thompson Road, which is the major east-west road for the suburb, Pattersons Road, which is a major east-west road for the southern edge of the suburb, and Bells Road, which serves the developing St Germain estate. Bells Road and Soldiers Road are not to be confused with their counterparts in Berwick, where they do not connect to the roads of the same name. Clyde North is a very car-dependent suburb, even when compared to its neighbouring suburbs.

=== Cycling ===
There are very few cycling paths in Clyde North. The few notable paths are on MacKillop Way, Thoroughbred Drive, and the pedestrian pathway alongside Heather Grove.

=== Public transport ===
Clyde North’s public transport is reliant on a number of public bus routes operated by Cranbourne Transit and Ventura Bus Lines that take passengers to shopping centres, railway stations, and schools.

The route 798 bus goes from the Cranbourne railway station to the Selandra Rise housing estate via the Cranbourne High Street, Narre Warren-Cranbourne Road, Linsell Boulevard, and Selandra Boulevard before terminating at Heather Grove. The route follows a 20 to 25 minute frequency on weekdays and 20 to 30 minute frequencies on weekends. 

The route 881 bus goes from the bus stop adjacent to the Merinda Park railway station to the St Germain estate via Thompson Road and St Germain Boulevard. The bus route has 40 minute frequencies. 

The route 888 bus goes from the Berwick railway station down Clyde Road and Berwick-Cranbourne Road and finishes at the boundary between Clyde North and Clyde. The route largely follows a one hour frequency. 

The route 889 bus goes from the Berwick railway station to the end of Skylark Boulevard (near Grayling Primary School and Rivercrest Christian College) via Clyde Road, Grices Road, Soldiers Road, and Skylark Boulevard. The route has frequencies of approximately 40 minutes. 

The route 897 bus goes from the Orana estate to Lynbrook station via Pattersons Road, the Cranbourne High street, Cranbourne railway station, and the suburbs of Cranbourne West and Lyndhurst. The route has 20 minute frequencies on weekdays and 20 to 30 frequencies on weekends.

The route 898 bus goes from the Cranbourne railway station via the high street of Cranbourne, Cameron Street, Bradford Drive before finally terminating at the end of Heather Grove. The route has 20 minute frequencies during weekdays and 40 to 60 minute frequencies during the weekend.

The route 899 bus goes from Berwick station to The Avenue Village Shopping Centre via Clyde Road, Arbourlea Boulevard, Wheelers Park Drive, Alisma Boulevard, Mountainview Boulevard, William Thwaites Boulevard, Linden Tree Way and Bibury Street. The route has frequencies of around 35 to 45 minutes.

==Estates==

Clyde North has since expanded and has many new estates. Selandra Rise which borders Cranbourne East has now been sold out and also now has a local shopping centre within the estate. Since the completion there have been a number of estates commence within the Clyde North area which have been listed below:

* Aspen on Clyde
* Berwick Waters
* Circa
* Highgrove
* Clydevale
* Thompsons Run
* The Boulevard
* Bloom
* Ramlegh Springs
* Meridian
* St Germain
* Delaray
* Northside

The ever expanding greater Cranbourne area consists of Cranbourne, Cranbourne North, Cranbourne East, Cranbourne South, Victoria and Cranbourne West.

==History==

Prior to European settlement the Cranbourne area is thought to have been occupied by the Boonwurrung Aboriginal people. The first white settlers, the Ruffy brothers, arrived in 1836. They later opened the Cranbourne Inn. 

The area was greatly opened up by settlers from the 1860s, with Cranbourne Post Office having been opened on 1 August 1857.

Progress in developing the land around Cranbourne was hampered by the Koo Wee Rup swampland. However William Lyall (who bought land in the swamp area) assisted in coordinating the draining of the swamp to make it usable as farmland.

Cranbourne was, from 1860 until 1994, the administrative centre of the Shire of Cranbourne, (known for most of 1994 as the City of Cranbourne). The council building is still in existence, and is now used as a health care centre known as &#x27;The Cranbourne Integrated Care Centre&#x27;. Prior to 1978, Council met at the Old Shire Offices, on the corner of Sladen Street and South Gippsland Highway.

Cranbourne possesses an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb), with tepid, relatively dry summers and cool, wetter winters.

Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 7 February 2009 to on 13 September 1996.

==Public transport==

The current terminus of the Cranbourne railway line is at Cranbourne railway station. The Cranbourne line is part of the South Gippsland Railway, which is currently disused between Cranbourne and the start of the private South Gippsland Tourist Railway in Nyora (now closed). The Cranbourne Line was to be extended by 2 km to Cranbourne East by 2015, as stated in the Victorian Transport Plan, but nothing has been done so far to show progress of the line extension. As of February 2022, the railway is duplicated. An extension of the line to Clyde was announced in 2021, as part of the Cranbourne Line Upgrade, with construction expected to begin around 2025.

The restoration and reopening of the disused line was proposed by the Victorian Government in 2001, at which time the government described the line as being in a state of significant disrepair. By 2008, a report had concluded that the rail service to Leongatha would not be restored due to the high cost in returning services. Instead, extra money will be spent on improving road coach services.

Cranbourne also has many bus services that help commuters travel to its surrounding suburbs.

== Environmental issues ==

Stevensons Brothers Industries (SBI) Landfill in Cranbourne emitted odour pollution which impacted nearby residents. After receiving more than 5,000 complaints between mid 2021 to mid 2023, EPA Victoria took Stevensons Brothers Industries (SBI) Landfill to court claiming that the company failed to fulfil their general environmental duty due to the landfill&#x27;s continued odour impact on nearby communities.

By 2009 the urban growth boundary had moved along Pearcedale and Browns Road, placing a large area of the locality inside the main growth area. Two large scale housing developments, Botanic Ridge and Settlers Run Estate, were established in the area which was excised as the suburb of Botanic Ridge.

In 2019, development in Cranbourne South&#x27;s area began with a new estate called Brompton. The part located within Cranbourne South is bounded by a new part of Ballarto Road to the north, Dandenong-Hastings Road to the west and Cranbourne Road to the south and east.

The suburb has a small primary school, a petrol station and a general store.

<text>Doveton is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 31 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Casey local government area. Doveton recorded a population of 9,603 at the 2021 census.

Doveton is bounded by Dandenong Creek and Power Road in the west, the Monash Freeway in the north, Eumemmerring Creek in the east, and Princes Highway in the south.

==History==

Originally part of the Eumemmerring pastoral run in the 1830s, Doveton gained its name from prominent early settler and Gold Commissioner, Captain Francis Crossman Doveton, who remained until around 1903.

Named around 1954, it was transformed into a public housing estate to house the post-war population increase caused by a surge in displaced people from war torn countries and an industrial boom in Dandenong. This is disputed.

Doveton Post Office opened on 1 December 1956 as the suburb was developing and booming. An example is that when it was first opened several of the state schools and colleges had increasing enrolments and had booming popularity and growth, and this is the reason why the post office was opened – the population continued to increase.

Sometime in 1967 the first library was opened by residents, during a period when Doveton lacked any community services or facilities. Around this time Doveton gained its first council representation.

Doveton has been studied by sociology academics since the 1960s. The results of the study were published in the book &#x27;An Australian Newtown&#x27; written by Lois Bryson and Faith Thompson in 1972. While Doveton was not specifically mentioned it is clear from the map of the area and the dates published that it is the sole subject of this book.

==Attractions==

A big attraction is Myuna Farm, an interactive animal farm where people can come to meet farm animals. The farm has a train for children to ride to the outer sections of the farm. It is a popular venue for children and hosts an annual Christmas carol event.

Melbourne&#x27;s second largest grey-headed flying fox camp is located at the Myuna Farm wetlands. These mega-bats are important pollinators of native tree species.

The Doveton Show is held annually as a volunteer-run community event coinciding with the Melbourne Show.

==Education==

Schools within Doveton include two state primary schools; Doveton North P.S and Doveton Heights P.S, one Catholic primary school (Holy Family Primary School) and one Christian primary school (Maranatha Christian School) for Prep – Grade 6, as well as two Muslim Schools (Ilim College and Minaret College)

==Sport==

The town has 2 Australian Rules football teams, The Doveton Doves Football Club which competes in Division 2 in the Southern Football League, and The Doveton Eagles, competing in Division 4. Coincidentally, both clubs were premiers in 2019 in their respective competitions. 

Doveton Soccer Club participates in the Victorian State League Division 1 South-East and play their home games at Waratah South Reserve, Eumemmerring. Since 2016 there has also been a Doveton boxing club which affiliates with Boxing Australia.

The Doveton Steelers play rugby league in NRL Victoria.

<doc id="611203" wikidata="Q7039953" url="?curid=611203" title="Nirenberg and Leder experiment">
<text>The Nirenberg and Leder experiment was a scientific experiment performed in 1964 by Marshall W. Nirenberg and Philip Leder. The experiment elucidated the triplet nature of the genetic code and allowed the remaining ambiguous codons in the genetic code to be deciphered.

In this experiment, using a ribosome binding assay called the triplet binding assay, various combinations of mRNA were passed through a filter which contained ribosomes. Unique triplets promoted the binding of specific tRNAs to the ribosome. By associating the tRNA with its specific amino acid, it was possible to determine the triplet mRNA sequence that coded for each amino acid.

==Background==
Oswald Avery discovered that the substance responsible for producing inheritable change in the disease-causing bacteria was neither a protein nor a lipid, rather deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). He and his colleagues Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty suggested that DNA was responsible for transferring genetic information. Later, Erwin Chargaff discovered that the makeup of DNA differs from one species to another. These experiments helped pave the way for the discovery of the structure of DNA. In 1953, with the help of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray crystallography, James Watson and Francis Crick proposed DNA is structured as a double helix.

In the 1960s, one main DNA mystery scientists needed to figure out was in translation how many bases would be in each code word, or codon. Scientists knew there were a total of four bases (guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine). They also knew that were 20 known amino acids. George Gamow suggested that the genetic code was made of three nucleotides per amino acid. He reasoned that because there are 20 amino acids and only four bases, the coding units could not be single (4 combinations) or pairs (only 16 combinations). Rather, he thought triplets (64 possible combinations) were the coding unit of the genetic code. However, he proposed that the triplets were overlapping and non-degenerate.

Seymour Benzer in the late 1950s had developed an assay using phage mutations which provided the first detailed linearly structured map of a genetic region.
Crick felt he could use mutagenesis and genetic recombination phage to further delineate the nature of the genetic code.
In the Crick, Brenner et al. experiment, using these phages, the triplet nature of the genetic code was confirmed. They used frameshift mutations and a process called reversions, to add and delete various numbers of nucleotides. When a nucleotide triplet was added to or deleted from the DNA sequence, the encoded protein was minimally affected. Thus, they concluded that the genetic code is a triplet code because it did not cause a frameshift in the reading frame. They correctly concluded that the code is degenerate, that triplets are not overlapping, and that each nucleotide sequence is read from a specific starting point.

==Experimental work==
The very first amino acid codon (UUU encoding phenylalanine) was deciphered by Nirenberg and his postdoc Heinrich Matthaei (see &quot;Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment&quot;) using long synthetic RNA. However, when similar RNAs are made containing more than one RNA base, the order of the bases was random. For example, a long RNA could be made that had a ratio of C to U of 2:1, and so would contain codons CCU, CUC, UCC at high frequency. When translated by ribosomes, this would produce a protein containing the amino acids proline, leucine, and serine; but it was not possible to say which codon matched which amino acid.

Instead, Nirenberg&#x27;s group turned to very short synthetic RNAs. They found that the trinucleotide UUU (which is the codon for phenylalanine), was able to cause specific association of phenylalanine-charged tRNA with ribosomes. This association could be detected by passing the mixture through a nitrocellulose filter: the filter captures ribosomes but not free tRNA; however if tRNA was associated with the ribosome, it would also be captured (along with the radioactive phenylalanine attached to the tRNA). They similarly found that trinucleotides AAA or CCC caused ribosome association of lysine-tRNA or proline-tRNA, respectively. 

So an experimental plan was clear: synthesize all 64 different trinucleotide combinations, and use the filter assay with tRNAs charged with all 20 amino acids, to see which amino acid associated with which trinucleotide. However, obtaining pure trinucleotides with mixed base sequences, for example GUU, was a daunting challenge. Leder&#x27;s pioneering studies used trinucleotides made by breaking down long random poly-GU RNA with nuclease and purifying specific trinucleotides by paper chromatography: he determined that GUU, UGU, and UUG encoded the amino acids valine, cysteine and leucine, respectively. Subsequently, Nirenberg&#x27;s group constructed trinucleotides by using DNA polymerases coupled with nucleotides and RNA polymerases to create the long random poly-GU RNA as well as artificially replicate the purified trinucleotides. Once high enough concentrations of mRNA were produced, degradation and reformation of polymerase products was accomplished through enzymatic processes. For example, AGU could be made from AG and U with polynucleotide phosphorylase; UAG could be made from AG and U with ribonuclease A in a high concentration of methanol. Nirenberg&#x27;s postdoc Merton Bernfield used these techniques to determine that UUU and UUC encode phenylalanine, UCU and UCC encode serine, and CCC and CCU encode proline, highlighting a pattern in the way the genetic code redundantly encodes amino acids. Many others in the Nirenberg lab and at NIH contributed to the full decipherment of the genetic code.

==Reception and legacy==
By the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium of 1966, between Nirenberg and Khorana the genetic code was almost completely decoded. Nirenberg was awarded the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He shared the award with Har Gobind Khorana of the University of Wisconsin and Robert W. Holley of the Salk Institute. Working independently, Khorana had mastered the synthesis of nucleic acids, and Holley had discovered the exact chemical structure of transfer-RNA. &lt;br&gt;
&quot;The New York Times&quot; said of Nirenberg&#x27;s work that &quot;the science of biology has reached a new frontier,&quot; leading to &quot;a revolution far greater in its potential significance than the atomic or hydrogen bomb.&quot; Most of the scientific community saw these experiments as highly important and beneficial. However, there were some who were concerned with the new era of molecular genetics. For example, Arne Tiselius, the 1948 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, asserted that knowledge of the genetic code could &quot;lead to methods of tampering with life, of creating new diseases, of controlling minds, of influencing heredity, even perhaps in certain desired directions.&quot;

Hampton Park is bounded by the South Gippsland Freeway in the west, Centre Road in the north, a line generally parallel to Langbourne Drive in the east, and Glasscocks Road in the south.

== History ==
The original development of Hampton Park dates from the post World War I era, when the area around Somerville Road was subdivided, with the Post Office opening on 22 November 1920. Electricity was connected in Hampton Park in 1942 and town water in 1961. Until these services were connected the people relied on lamps and tank water for their light and water needs.

Development of the area commenced in the 1970s, with neighbour Lynbrook&#x27;s estate development starting in 1994. 

Hampton Park, Lynbrook and Lyndhurst&#x27;s population grew from 1996 to 2001 due to an increase in the dwelling stock from 1996 to 2001.

== Environmental issues ==

=== Fire at waste station ===
Late 2017, 30 x 40 metres sized fire started in a waste transfer station containing household waste and was under control within a few hours. Neighbouring communities were alerted of the risk of smoke heading in a northerly direction.

=== Odour pollution from Hallam Road Veolia landfill ===
Several pollution reports were sent to EPA Victoria at the end of 2020 due to the strong garbage-type smell coming from the landfill formerly owned by SUEZ on Hallam Road. The odour pollution was due to the tipping face and the company worked on covering it during the day.

Following the purchase of the landfill in 2022 by Veolia, the company received several notices from EPA for non compliance to their operating licence including a failure to reduce the risk of harm. The impact of the different odours and gases coming from the landfill were confirmed by EPA monitoring to be unlikely to cause long term impact. The company is set to submit a Landfill Gas Management plan by March 2024.

== Events ==
A partially undressed body was found at Hampton Park landfill in 2014 and was identified to be a 34 year old man from Endeavour Hills but no additional information could be found about the man&#x27;s death.

<doc id="611210" wikidata="Q3440872" url="?curid=611210" title="Roman Kroitor">
<text>Roman Kroitor (December 12, 1926 – September 17, 2012) was a Canadian filmmaker who was known as a pioneer of &quot;Cinéma vérité&quot;, as the co-founder of IMAX, and as the creator of the Sandde hand-drawn stereoscopic 3D animation system. He was also the original inspiration for The Force. His prodigious output garnered numerous awards, including two BAFTA Awards, three Cannes Film Festival awards, and two Oscar nominations. 

==Early life==
Roman Boghdan Kroitor was born in Yorkton, Saskatchewan, to Ukrainian immigrants Peter and Tatiana (Shewchuk), both of whom were teachers. Peter died when Roman was four; Tatiana moved the family to Winnipeg and continued teaching. Roman attended the University of Manitoba, graduating in 1951 with a Master of Arts in Philosophy. 

==National Film Board of Canada==
In 1949 and 1950, Kroitor attended the Summer Intern program at the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) in Ottawa. Upon graduation from university, he was hired full-time, working as a production assistant and later as a film editor. His first film, 1953&#x27;s &quot;Rescue Party&quot; laid the foundation for his pioneering Cinéma vérité style, and he went on to produce influential films such as &quot;Lonely Boy&quot;, &quot;Glenn Gould: On the Record&quot;, &quot;Glenn Gould: Off the Record&quot;, and the concert film &quot;Stravinsky&quot;. By 1958, Kroiter was producing documentaries; by 1964, he was one of the producers leading the NFB into the production of fiction films. 

==IMAX==
After seeing the ground-breaking NFB documentary &quot;Universe&quot; (1960), Stanley Kubrick tried to recruit Kroiter and Colin Low to work on &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. They declined because, with Hugh O&#x27;Connor and Tom Daily, they were working on a large-scale multi-screen film. This was &quot;In the Labyrinth&quot;, which the NFB exhibited at Expo 67 in Montreal. The film caused a sensation and, in the same year Kroitor and his friend and colleague, the director Graeme Ferguson, left the NFB as employees, but physically stayed, founding Multi-Screen Corporation (later IMAX Corp.) in the NFB&#x27;s Montreal studios (with two other friends, Robert Kerr and engineer Bill Shaw). The Multi-Screen process involved a purpose-built camera, and 70mm film projected horizontally rather than vertically, with each frame the size of a postcard.

In 1970, for Expo 70 in Osaka, Kroitor produced the first IMAX film, the 17-minute &quot;Tiger Child&quot;, directed by Donald Brittain. In 1973, he returned to the NFB as a producer in charge of the Drama department, but continued to make IMAX films until his retirement. In 1990, he co-directed the first IMAX feature film, &quot;Stones at the Max&quot;. He also produced the first IMAX stereoscopic (S3D) film, &quot;We Are Born of Stars&quot; (anaglyph, 1985), and co-produced the first full-color OMNIMAX (IMAX Dome) S3D film, &quot;Echoes of the Sun&quot; (alternate-eye, 1990).

==SANDDE==
While working to create traditional (actuality) and early CG films in a stereoscopic format, Kroitor became frustrated with the lack of direct interaction between the desires of (right-brained) artists and the results on film, because everything had to pass through the (left-brained) mathematicians and programmers. He conceived of the SANDDE hardware and software system as a way to allow artists to directly draw, in full stereoscopic 3D, what they want the audience to see.

==George Lucas and The Force==
Kroitor was credited by &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator George Lucas, as being the origin of the concept of The Force, an important thematic element in the Star Wars films. As reported by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Lucas &quot;first heard about &quot;the force&quot; in a conversation between Kroitor and Warren Sturgis McCulloch, an artificial intelligence guru, in &quot;21-87&quot;, a 1963 collage film made by the NFB&#x27;s Arthur Lipsett. Disagreeing with McCulloch&#x27;s assertion that humans are nothing more than highly complex machines, Kroitor argued,: &quot;Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in communication with other living things, they become aware of some kind of force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
In 1955, Kroitor married (Graeme Ferguson&#x27;s sister) Janet Ferguson; they had five children and lived in Montreal. On September 17, 2012, he died of a heart attack in his sleep at the age of 85.

<text>Harkaway is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 39 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Casey local government area. Harkaway recorded a population of 1,011 at the .

Harkaway is located at the northeast corner of the City of Casey and is bounded by Robinson, Halleur and Harkaway Roads in the west, Boundary Road in the north, Cardinia Creek in the east, and by an irregular border with Berwick, Victoria below Dalton Reserve in the south.

==History==

Prior to European settlement, the area was home to the Bunurong and Wurundjeri indigenous peoples. They maintained a traditional hunting and gathering lifestyle with seasonal movements. A number of stone axe heads have been found in the Harkaway area in a location known as &quot;Bald Hill&quot;, and some reports say that a corroboree was held there in 1858. However, by 1840, reduction of their hunting grounds, draining of the swamps and introduction of European diseases such as smallpox and measles effectively ended their ability to maintain a traditional lifestyle.

The area was settled by German immigrants in the 1850s. They initially bought land at Thomastown with the intention of subdividing a German settlement, but fresh from trying their luck at the Bendigo goldfields, found the fertile land at Harkaway south of King Road (originally Koenig Road, built as a stock route to water the cattle) and settled there instead. They typically built small timber cottages for themselves and practiced small-scale intensive agriculture on family lots, with the families primarily engaged in clearing the land and growing wheat, oats and potatoes, and &quot;also very active in dairying&quot;. However, a townsite was never actually declared. Harkaway Post Office opened on 1 January 1865.

The settlers also constructed a number of other buildings – a Lutheran church (1869), the belfry of which is still intact and is located on Hessell Road; a single-room brick school (1876), a post office and a community hall (1909).

==Notable people==

Minnie a&#x27;Beckett, who married Arthur Merric Boyd, founder of the Boyd artistic dynasty, was based at &quot;The Grange&quot; in Harkaway in her early years, and Jessie Traill (1881–1967), a noted Australian painter, set up a studio in the 1920s.

==Present day==

The town can be reached from Melbourne and the Monash Freeway by exiting at Heatherton Road, which becomes King Road on entering Harkaway. Most services are provided from nearby Berwick and Narre Warren. With the exception of Harkaway Road, Marks Court, St Fort Court, and a portion of King Road and Noack Road, all roads outside the main town are unsealed.

In 2023, Harkaway Primary School had an enrolment of 116 students, 58 female and 58 male, a community hall, tennis courts and numerous walking and equestrian trails.

The area is not served by Melbourne public transport.

It contained the Pioneer Harkaway quarry on Noack Road, now closed.

<doc id="611215" wikidata="Q992759" url="?curid=611215" title="Te Awamutu">
<text>Te Awamutu is a town in the Waikato region in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the council seat of the Waipa District and serves as a service town for the farming communities which surround it. Te Awamutu is located some south of Hamilton on State Highway 3, one of the two main routes south from Auckland and Hamilton.

Te Awamutu has a population of making it the fifth-largest urban area in the Waikato behind Hamilton, Taupō, Cambridge and Tokoroa.

The town is often referred to as &quot;The Rose Town of New Zealand&quot; because of its elaborate rose gardens in the centre of the town. Many local businesses use &quot;Rosetown&quot; in their name, and the symbol of the rose is widely used on local signs and billboards. The local paper, &quot;Te Awamutu Courier&quot;, has a symbol of a rose in the masthead on its front page.

==History and culture==
Tainui Māori first settled in the area in about 1450, according to noted Tainui historian Te Hurinui-Jones. Te Awamutu means &quot;the river cut short&quot;, as it marked the end of the navigable section of the Mangapiko Stream.

Te Awamutu was the birthplace of the first Māori King, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero (died 1860).

The first European missionaries visited the area in 1834. A missionary settlement was set up by Benjamin Yate Ashwell of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). and Māori Christians in July 1839 after they observed Tainui warriors, who had been fighting at Rotorua, return with 60 backpacks of human remains and proceed to cook and eat them in the Otawhao Pa. In 1842 the Rev. John Morgan moved to the Otawhao Mission Station. Otawhao was to the south west of Te Awamutu, on the rise overlooking what is now Centennial Park.

The CMS missionaries established a flourishing trade school that focused on developing agricultural skills. The missionaries introduced European crops such as wheat, potatoes and peaches. In 1846 Morgan provided advice and some capital to help local Māori to construct eight water mills to grind wheat into flour. Morgan assisted in finding a suitable miller to operate the mills and to train Māori in this skill.

Possibly the oldest surviving building in the Waikato is St John&#x27;s church, built in 1853 as part of the mission station. It is in Gothic Revival style. During the 1850s the wider area prospered on the back of sending surplus farm produce to Auckland. For a brief period wheat was even sent overseas. By the late 1850s prices dropped as cheaper flour and other foodstuffs were imported from Australia. This caused huge resentment among local Māori who had grown use to the wealth provided by trade. Some of the more warlike Māori such as Rewi Maniapoto blamed the missionaries for having a negative influence on Māori &quot;tikanga&quot; (cultural practices). He attempted to kill the local missionary and burnt down the trade school and other mission buildings. Some Christian Māori warned Europeans to leave the Waikato as their lives were in danger. Te Awamutu was a major site during the New Zealand Wars of the 19th century, serving as a garrison town for the colonial settlers from 1864. European settlement began at the conclusion of the Waikato Wars (1863–1865).

=== Marae ===
The local Mangatoatoa Marae and Te Maru o Ihowa meeting house is a meeting place for the Ngāti Maniapoto hapū of Ngutu, Pare te Kawa and Parewaeono, and the Waikato Tainui hapū of Ngāti Ngutu and Ngāti Paretekawa.

=== Local government ===
Rangiaowhia, or Rangiaohia Highway Board administered the roads in the town until Te Awamutu Town Board&#x27;s election on 1 November 1884. The board first met on 8 November, though there had been an earlier attempt to form a board and there was an unsuccessful challenge to the legality of the election. Te Awamutu Borough Council took over from the board and first met on 10 May 1915. It was merged into Waipā District Council on 23 October 1989.

==Geography==

Te Awamutu literally means in English &quot;The River&#x27;s End&quot;. The town is on gently undulating land close to the banks of a tributary of the Waipā River. The Waikato Plains lie to the north and east, and the promontory of Mount Pirongia, 20 kilometres to the west, is easily visible. Inside the township are two streams called the Mangapiko Stream and the Mangaohoi Stream. The Mangaohoi ends and becomes the Tributary of the Mangapiko near Memorial park.

The town is close to the extinct Kakepuku and Pirongia volcanoes (and other volcanoes of the Alexandra Volcanic Group). Maungatautari, another extinct volcanic cone, now the site of New Zealand&#x27;s largest ecological restoration project, is also nearby.

Other towns surrounding Te Awamutu include Cambridge, 25 kilometres to the northeast, Otorohanga, 30 kilometres to the southwest, and Raglan 50 kilometres to the northwest. The small town of Kihikihi lies just to the south of Te Awamutu.

The main thoroughfare is Alexandra Street, so named because it was once the main road to the town of Alexandra (since renamed to Pirongia to avoid confusion with the town of Alexandra in the South Island).

==Demographics==
Te Awamutu covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Te Awamutu had a population of 12,198 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 1,578 people (14.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,052 people (20.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 4,656 households, comprising 5,787 males and 6,414 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.9 males per female, with 2,421 people (19.8%) aged under 15 years, 2,208 (18.1%) aged 15 to 29, 4,944 (40.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 2,631 (21.6%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 81.8% European/Pākehā, 23.2% Māori, 2.7% Pacific peoples, 4.5% Asian, and 1.7% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 14.7, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 50.4% had no religion, 37.1% were Christian, 1.1% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.8% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.9% had other religions.

The employment status of those at least 15 was that 4,587 (46.9%) people were employed full-time, 1,308 (13.4%) were part-time, and 393 (4.0%) were unemployed.

For earlier censuses, Te Awamutu was divided into four area units, central, east, south and west, as in this table. Māori formed 19.7% of the population in central, 22.8% in east, 23.2% in south and 25.7% in west.
==Facilities and attractions==

Te Awamutu Museum was established in 1935. The museum has a number of permanent exhibitions focusing on the history of Te Awamutu and the surrounding area.

The museum contains one of the most famous early Māori artifacts, a large carved post known simply as &quot;Te Uenuku&quot;. This impressive carving has caused much controversy because its style is markedly different from any other early Māori work, yet it is clearly of a Māori design.

Te Awamutu itself is located on SH3, one of the major routes used when touring the North Island of New Zealand.

The town has three large supermarkets, electronics retailers, a well equipped sports / leisure centre and The Kihikihi Trail cycleway, which opened in 2017.

The town has a large dairy factory, and serves as an important centre in the local dairy industry.

==Education==

Te Awamutu has two co-educational state primary schools: Te Awamutu Primary School, with a roll of and Pekerau School with a roll of .

Many of these students then progress on to Te Awamutu Intermediate, with a roll of , and Te Awamutu College, with a roll of .

* Waipa Christian School is a co-educational Year 1–8 state integrated Christian primary school, with a roll of .
* Te Wharekura o Nga Purapura o te Aroha is a co-educational Year 1–15 state school, with a roll of as of 

==Notable residents==

The town&#x27;s best known residents are the Finn Brothers, Tim and Neil, whose musical careers have stretched from Split Enz through the internationally successful Crowded House to their current solo and collaborative works. The town is mentioned in Split Enz&#x27;s song &quot;Haul Away&quot;, and also in Crowded House&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Mean to Me&quot;, the debut single from their self-titled debut album. 

Writer Heather Morris, author of The Tattooist of Auschwitz, was born in the town in 1953. She was inducted into the Te Awamutu Walk of Fame in 2019.

Musician Spencer P. Jones (The Beasts of Bourbon, Paul Kelly and The Coloured Girls) was also born in Te Awamutu. 

Two Anglican priests of note were the last incumbent vicars of the old St Johns Church. They were The Rev Martin Gloster Sullivan, vicar prior to WW2 who in 1950 became Dean of Christchurch Cathedral and, later Dean of St Pauls Cathedral London, and The Rev John David Hogg who was to become the Anglican Archdeacon of Waikato and Vicar General of the Waikato Diocese.

<doc id="611218" wikidata="Q6607248" url="?curid=611218" title="List of baronies in the peerages of Britain and Ireland">
<text>The peerage is the collective term for all those holding titles of nobility of all degrees. The term superseded the term baronage used of the feudal era. 
A barony is a rank or dignity of a man or a woman who is a participant of a small rank of a British nobility.

==Barony categories==
===Life baronies===
The life baronies fall into two classes:
*List of life peerages (created under the Life Peerages Act 1958):
**List of life peerages (1958–1979)
**List of life peerages (1979–1997)
**List of life peerages (1997–2010)
**List of life peerages (2010–2024)
**List of life peerages (2024–present)
*List of law life peerages (created under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876)

All life baronies are in the peerage of the United Kingdom, and rank amongst hereditary baronies in that peerage (and each other) by date of creation.

===Hereditary baronies===
The hereditary baronies fall into five classes:
*List of baronies in the peerage of England
*List of lordships of parliament (in the peerage of Scotland)
*List of baronies in the peerage of Great Britain
*List of baronies in the peerage of Ireland
*List of hereditary baronies in the peerage of the United Kingdom

These have precedence in the order named, except that baronies of Ireland created after 1 January 1801 (the date of the Union between Great Britain and Ireland) yield to earlier-created baronies of the United Kingdom.

===Hereditary Scottish baronies===

In contrast to the English equivalent, the dignity of baron is a non-peerage rank in the Baronage of Scotland, created in the same way as a peerage with crown charter and is protected by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 recognised by the crown as a title of nobility with status of minor baron. Hence the Scottish equivalent of an English baron is Lord of Parliament. The heraldry of Scottish baronies is governed by the court of the Lord Lyon. The Scottish baronage predates the Scottish peerage and they coexist to this day. In fact, up until 1707 union of Scotland and England, the only difference was that peerage titles were personal honours with strict rules of succession, and baronage titles were free baronies attached to land, and freely assignable, with each new baron requiring a confirmation charter from the crown (up until 1874) to ensure loyalty.

* List of baronies in the baronage of Scotland

===Hereditary feudal baronies===
These are distinct from the titles above, created by writ or patent, and were constituents of the now defunct feudal baronage and are not therefore constituents of the modern, post-feudal peerage:

*List of English feudal baronies
*List of Marcher lordships

<doc id="611219" wikidata="Q6708388" url="?curid=611219" title="Lynbrook, Victoria">
<text>Lynbrook is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 36 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Casey local government area. Lynbrook recorded a population of 9,121 at the 2021 census.

Lynbrook is positioned on the South Gippsland Highway, slightly north-west of Cranbourne, and just south of the residential suburb of Hampton Park. Lynbrook is bounded by Dandenong Hastings Road in the west, the South Gippsland Freeway in the north, by a line north of Merinda Park railway station in the east, and the railway line in the south.

The suburb was developed by VicUrban, starting in 1994. A special feature of the VicUrban development is the stormwater catchment which flows into the lake and wetlands where it is purified before being released into Dandenong Creek and into Port Phillip Bay.

Prior to 1994, the area now occupied by Lynbrook was part of Lyndhurst.

There are two primary schools, one State and one Catholic. There is a central shopping centre with Coles and a range of strip shops with take away food and eateries, a gym, medical centre, pharmacy, news agency, butcher, bakery, and hair and beauty. There is also a Community Centre, child care centres, vet, kindergarten and maternal child health nurse.

Lynbrook has a local resident&#x27;s group, the Lynbrook Residents Association (LRA), who advocate to Local, State and Federal Government on behalf of residents with local issues. They also host a number of Community Events to bring the community together to create a sense of belonging and community in Lynbrook.

==History==

In 1999, the Urban Land Corporation released land in the first stage of what was then called Lynbrook Heights. These blocks are located on the opposite side of the South Gippsland Highway to the sales office and the first few stages of the Lynbrook development. Lynbrook Heights offered larger blocks (greater than 650 square metres) than earlier land releases, as well as city views from the hill. The development included a recreational area called Tower Hill. The Lynbrook Heights section is a triangular section of land wedged between the South Gippsland Highway and Hallam Road, but is part of Lynbrook Suburb.

Lynbrook Primary School opened in January 2005 with an initial enrolment of 175 students, and 937 students in 2013. A Catholic primary school, St Francis de Sales Primary School, opened in 2010 on the corner of Aylmer Rd and Henning Ave.

A maternal and child health centre was constructed by Casey Council and opened in early 2006. This centre also includes a pre-school kindergarten for the growing number of children in the area.

Banjo Paterson Park, a large recreation reserve, has many paths for walking and cycling, a barbecue area, a large children&#x27;s playground, open spaces and a football / cricket oval. The oval was home to the &quot;Lynbrook Lakers&quot; cricket team which fields a number of adult and children&#x27;s cricket teams in the local Dandenong District Cricket Association (DDCA) league, where the 1st XI has won the premiership for the last 3 years straight (2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09). A new oval has been constructed, complete with clubroom facilities, which the club will be using from the commencement of the 2009/10 season at Marriot Waters in nearby Lyndhurst.

On the corner of South Gippsland Highway and Lynbrook Boulevard is a small shopping centre complex managed by Retpro since opening in March 2007. Lynbrook Village features a 3,700 square metre Coles Supermarket and Liquor outlet along with 33 speciality stores including Foiled Again Hairdressing salon, and a free standing building, previously occupied by Red Rooster, then Souvlaki Hut, and is now occupied by Suburban Burger.

On 22 April 2012, the Lynbrook railway station opened on the Cranbourne line. It is located north of Aylmer Road.

On 30 May 2015, the Lynbrook Community Centre opened which is located on the corner of Lynbrook Boulevard and Harris Street. This is a multipurpose community facility which abuts the local shopping centre.

The Lyndhurst Football and Netball Club was established in 2009 by Andrew King formally known as Lynbrook Football Club based at Lynbrook Primary School.

<text>A-Kon is an annual three-day anime convention held during June at the Irving Convention Center at Las Colinas and Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas. First held in 1990 with just 380 people in attendance, A-Kon is North America&#x27;s longest running convention primarily focused on anime.

==Departments==
A-Kon consists of many volunteer managed teams each dedicated to operating a portion of this large convention. Each year, usually in February or March, they post a web page for volunteer sign-up. Volunteers work at least sixteen hours during the weekend and receive a free pass to the convention. Working for 20 hours, volunteers aged over 18 can receive a hotel room, shared with 3 other staff members.

==Programming==
While the focus of the convention was originally centered on anime fandom and screenings of films and television series, many other activities take place encompassing various segments of geek and Japanese pop culture. These events include panels with American authors and artists, a console gaming room, tabletop gaming room, cosplay, scavenger hunts, martial arts demonstrations, an art show, and concerts by Japanese and SteamPunk bands. The convention also maintains a vigorous social network presence on Facebook and Twitter, having about 15,000 and 7,000 followers respectively, through which they post information and run contests throughout the year.

==History==
The name seems to be a play on the early anime series Project A-ko. A-Kon 2020 was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A-Kon 2021 was also cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A-Kon 2024 was postponed due to various issues including financial problems.

<doc id="611229" wikidata="Q116646" url="?curid=611229" title="Dissection">
<text>Dissection (from Latin &#x27; &quot;to cut to pieces&quot;; also calledanatomization) is the dismembering of the body of a deceased animal or plant to study its anatomical structure. Autopsy is used in pathology and forensic medicine to determine the cause of death in humans. Less extensive dissection of plants and smaller animals preserved in a formaldehyde solution is typically carried out or demonstrated in biology and natural science classes in middle school and high school, while extensive dissections of cadavers of adults and children, both fresh and preserved are carried out by medical students in medical schools as a part of the teaching in subjects such as anatomy, pathology and forensic medicine. Consequently, dissection is typically conducted in a morgue or in an anatomy lab.

Dissection has been used for centuries to explore anatomy. Objections to the use of cadavers have led to the use of alternatives including virtual dissection of computer models.

In the field of surgery, the term &quot;dissection&quot; or &quot;dissecting&quot; means more specifically the practice of separating an anatomical structure (an organ, nerve or blood vessel) from its surrounding connective tissue in order to minimize unwanted damage during a surgical procedure.

==Overview==

Plant and animal bodies are dissected to analyze the structure and function of its components. Dissection is practised by students in courses of biology, botany, zoology, and veterinary science, and sometimes in arts studies. In medical schools, students dissect human cadavers to learn anatomy. Zoötomy is sometimes used to describe &quot;dissection of an animal&quot;.

===Human dissection===
A key principle in the dissection of human cadavers (sometimes called androtomy) is the prevention of human disease to the dissector. Prevention of transmission includes the wearing of protective gear, ensuring the environment is clean, dissection technique and pre-dissection tests to specimens for the presence of HIV and hepatitis viruses. Specimens are dissected in morgues or anatomy labs. When provided, they are evaluated for use as a &quot;fresh&quot; or &quot;prepared&quot; specimen. A &quot;fresh&quot; specimen may be dissected within some days, retaining the characteristics of a living specimen, for the purposes of training. A &quot;prepared&quot; specimen may be preserved in solutions such as formalin and pre-dissected by an experienced anatomist, sometimes with the help of a diener. This preparation is sometimes called prosection.

Most dissection involves the careful isolation and removal of individual organs, called the Virchow technique. An alternative more cumbersome technique involves the removal of the entire organ body, called the Letulle technique. This technique allows a body to be sent to a funeral director without waiting for the sometimes time-consuming dissection of individual organs. The Rokitansky method involves an &quot;in situ&quot; dissection of the organ block, and the technique of Ghon involves dissection of three separate blocks of organs - the thorax and cervical areas, gastrointestinal and abdominal organs, and urogenital organs. Dissection of individual organs involves accessing the area in which the organ is situated, and systematically removing the anatomical connections of that organ to its surroundings. For example, when removing the heart, connects such as the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava are separated. If pathological connections exist, such as a fibrous pericardium, then this may be deliberately dissected along with the organ.

===Autopsy and necropsy===
Dissection is used to help to determine the cause of death in autopsy (called necropsy in other animals) and is an intrinsic part of forensic medicine.

==History==
===Classical antiquity===
Human dissections were carried out by the Greek physicians Herophilus of Chalcedon and Erasistratus of Chios in the early part of the third century BC. Before then, animal dissection had been carried out systematically starting from the fifth century BC. During this period, the first exploration into full human anatomy was performed rather than a base knowledge gained from &#x27;problem-solution&#x27; delving. While there was a deep taboo in Greek culture concerning human dissection, there was at the time a strong push by the Ptolemaic government to build Alexandria into a hub of scientific study. For a time, Roman law forbade dissection and autopsy of the human body, so anatomists relied on the cadavers of animals or made observations of human anatomy from injuries of the living. Galen, for example, dissected the Barbary macaque and other primates, assuming their anatomy was basically the same as that of humans, and supplemented these observations with knowledge of human anatomy which he acquired while tending to wounded gladiators.

Celsus wrote in &quot;On Medicine I Proem 23&quot;, &quot;Herophilus and Erasistratus proceeded in by far the best way: they cut open living men - criminals they obtained out of prison from the kings and they observed, while their subjects still breathed, parts that nature had previously hidden, their position, color, shape, size, arrangement, hardness, softness, smoothness, points of contact, and finally the processes and recesses of each and whether any part is inserted into another or receives the part of another into itself.&quot;

Galen was another such writer who was familiar with the studies of Herophilus and Erasistratus.

===India===
The ancient societies that were rooted in India left behind artwork on how to kill animals during a hunt. The images showing how to kill most effectively depending on the game being hunted relay an intimate knowledge of both external and internal anatomy as well as the relative importance of organs. The knowledge was mostly gained through hunters preparing the recently captured prey. Once the roaming lifestyle was no longer necessary it was replaced in part by the civilization that formed in the Indus Valley. Unfortunately, there is little that remains from this time to indicate whether or not dissection occurred, the civilization was lost to the Aryan people migrating.

Early in the history of India (2nd to 3rd century), the Arthashastra described the 4 ways that death can occur and their symptoms: drowning, hanging, strangling, or asphyxiation. According to that source, an autopsy should be performed in any case of untimely demise.

The practice of dissection flourished during the 7th and 8th century. It was under their rule that medical education was standardized. This created a need to better understand human anatomy, so as to have educated surgeons. Dissection was limited by the religious taboo on cutting the human body. This changed the approach taken to accomplish the goal. The process involved the loosening of the tissues in streams of water before the outer layers were sloughed off with soft implements to reach the musculature. To perfect the technique of slicing, the prospective students used gourds and squash. These techniques of dissection gave rise to an advanced understanding of the anatomy and the enabled them to complete procedures used today, such as rhinoplasty.

During medieval times the anatomical teachings from India spread throughout the known world; however, the practice of dissection was stunted by Islam. The practice of dissection at a university level was not seen again until 1827, when it was performed by the student Pandit Madhusudan Gupta. Through the 1900s, the university teachers had to continually push against the social taboos of dissection, until around 1850 when the universities decided that it was more cost effective to train Indian doctors than bring them in from Britain. Indian medical schools were, however, training female doctors well before those in England.

The current state of dissection in India is deteriorating. The number of hours spent in dissection labs during medical school has decreased substantially over the last twenty years. The future of anatomy education will probably be an elegant mix of traditional methods and integrative computer learning. The use of dissection in early stages of medical training has been shown more effective in the retention of the intended information than their simulated counterparts. However, there is use for the computer-generated experience as review in the later stages. The combination of these methods is intended to strengthen the students&#x27; understanding and confidence of anatomy, a subject that is infamously difficult to master. There is a growing need for anatomist—seeing as most anatomy labs are taught by graduates hoping to complete degrees in anatomy—to continue the long tradition of anatomy education.

===Islamic world===
From the beginning of the Islamic faith in 610 A.D., Shari&#x27;ah law has applied to a greater or lesser extent within Muslim countries, supported by Islamic scholars such as Al-Ghazali. Islamic physicians such as Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) (1091–1161) in Al-Andalus, Saladin&#x27;s physician Ibn Jumay during the 12th century, Abd el-Latif in Egypt , and Ibn al-Nafis in Syria and Egypt in the 13th century may have practiced dissection, but it remains ambiguous whether or not human dissection was practiced. Ibn al-Nafis, a physician and Muslim jurist, suggested that the &quot;precepts of Islamic law have discouraged us from the practice of dissection, along with whatever compassion is in our temperament&quot;, indicating that while there was no law against it, it was nevertheless uncommon. Islam dictates that the body be buried as soon as possible, barring religious holidays, and that there be no other means of disposal such as cremation. Prior to the 10th century, dissection was not performed on human cadavers. The book &quot;Al-Tasrif&quot;, written by Al-Zahrawi in 1000 A.D., details surgical procedure that differed from the previous standards. The book was an educational text of medicine and surgery which included detailed illustrations. It was later translated and took the place of Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot; as the primary teaching tool in Europe from the 12th century to the 17th century. There were some that were willing to dissect humans up to the 12th century, for the sake of learning, after which it was forbidden. This attitude remained constant until 1952, when the Islamic School of Jurisprudence in Egypt ruled that &quot;necessity permits the forbidden&quot;. This decision allowed for the investigation of questionable deaths by autopsy. In 1982, the decision was made by a fatwa that if it serves justice, autopsy is worth the disadvantages. Though Islam now approves of autopsy, the Islamic public still disapproves. Autopsy is prevalent in most Muslim countries for medical and judicial purposes. In Egypt it holds an important place within the judicial structure, and is taught at all the country&#x27;s medical universities. In Saudi Arabia, whose law is completely dictated by Shari&#x27;ah, autopsy is viewed poorly by the population but can be compelled in criminal cases; human dissection is sometimes found at university level. Autopsy is performed for judicial purposes in Qatar and Tunisia. Human dissection is present in the modern day Islamic world, but is rarely published on due to the religious and social stigma.

===Tibet===

Tibetan medicine developed a rather sophisticated knowledge of anatomy, acquired from long-standing experience with human dissection. Tibetans had adopted the practice of sky burial because of the country&#x27;s hard ground, frozen for most of the year, and the lack of wood for cremation. A sky burial begins with a ritual dissection of the deceased, and is followed by the feeding of the parts to vultures on the hill tops. Over time, Tibetan anatomical knowledge found its way into Ayurveda and to a lesser extent into Chinese medicine.

===Christian Europe===
Throughout the history of Christian Europe, the dissection of human cadavers for medical education has experienced various cycles of legalization and proscription in different countries. Dissection was rare during the Middle Ages, but it was practised, with evidence from at least as early as the 13th century. The practice of autopsy in Medieval Western Europe is &quot;very poorly known&quot; as few surgical texts or conserved human dissections have survived.
A modern Jesuit scholar has claimed that the Christian theology contributed significantly to the revival of human dissection and autopsy by providing a new socio-religious and cultural context in which the human cadaver was no longer seen as sacrosanct.

A non-existent edict of the 1163 Council of Tours and an early 14th-century decree of Pope Boniface VIII have mistakenly been identified as prohibiting dissection and autopsy; misunderstanding or extrapolation from these edicts may have contributed to reluctance to perform such procedures. The Middle Ages witnessed the revival of an interest in medical studies, including human dissection and autopsy.
Frederick II (1194–1250), the Holy Roman Emperor, decreed that any that were studying to be a physician or a surgeon must attend a human dissection, which would be held no less than every five years. Some European countries began legalizing the dissection of executed criminals for educational purposes in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. Mondino de Luzzi carried out the first recorded public dissection around 1315. At this time, autopsies were carried out by a team consisting of a Lector, who lectured; the Sector, who did the dissection; and the Ostensor, who pointed to features of interest.

The Italian Galeazzo di Santa Sofia made the first public dissection north of the Alps in Vienna in 1404.

Vesalius in the 16th century carried out numerous dissections in his extensive anatomical investigations. He was attacked frequently for his disagreement with Galen&#x27;s opinions on human anatomy. Vesalius was the first to lecture and dissect the cadaver simultaneously.

The Catholic Church is known to have ordered an autopsy on conjoined twins Joana and Melchiora Ballestero in Hispaniola in 1533 to determine whether they shared a soul. They found that there were two distinct hearts, and hence two souls, based on the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles, who believed the soul resided in the heart.

Human dissection was also practised by Renaissance artists. Though most chose to focus on the external surfaces of the body, some like Michelangelo Buonarotti, Antonio del Pollaiuolo, Baccio Bandinelli, and Leonardo da Vinci sought a deeper understanding. However, there were no provisions for artists to obtain cadavers, so they had to resort to unauthorised means, as indeed anatomists sometimes did, such as grave robbing, body snatching, and murder.

Anatomization was sometimes ordered as a form of punishment, as, for example, in 1806 to James Halligan and Dominic Daley after their public hanging in Northampton, Massachusetts.

In modern Europe, dissection is routinely practised in biological research and education, in medical schools, and to determine the cause of death in autopsy. It is generally considered a necessary part of learning and is thus accepted culturally. It sometimes attracts controversy, as when Odense Zoo decided to dissect lion cadavers in public before a &quot;self-selected audience&quot;.

===Britain===

In Britain, dissection remained entirely prohibited from the end of the Roman conquest and through the Middle Ages to the 16th century, when a series of royal edicts gave specific groups of physicians and surgeons some limited rights to dissect cadavers. The permission was quite limited: by the mid-18th century, the Royal College of Physicians and Company of Barber-Surgeons were the only two groups permitted to carry out dissections, and had an annual quota of ten cadavers between them. As a result of pressure from anatomists, especially in the rapidly growing medical schools, the Murder Act 1752 allowed the bodies of executed murderers to be dissected for anatomical research and education. By the 19th century this supply of cadavers proved insufficient, as the public medical schools were growing, and the private medical schools lacked legal access to cadavers. A thriving black market arose in cadavers and body parts, leading to the creation of the profession of body snatching, and the infamous Burke and Hare murders in 1828, when 16 people were murdered for their cadavers, to be sold to anatomists. The resulting public outcry led to the passage of the Anatomy Act 1832, which increased the legal supply of cadavers for dissection.

By the 21st century, the availability of interactive computer programs and changing public sentiment led to renewed debate on the use of cadavers in medical education. The Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry in the UK, founded in 2000, became the first modern medical school to carry out its anatomy education without dissection.

===United States===
In the United States, dissection of frogs became common in college biology classes from the 1920s, and were gradually introduced at earlier stages of education. By 1988, some 75 to 80 percent of American high school biology students were participating in a frog dissection, with a trend towards introduction in elementary schools. The frogs are most commonly from the genus &quot;Rana&quot;. Other popular animals for high-school dissection at the time of that survey were, among vertebrates, fetal pigs, perch, and cats; and among invertebrates, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish, and starfish. About six million animals are dissected each year in United States high schools (2016), not counting medical training and research. Most of these are purchased already dead from slaughterhouses and farms.

Dissection in U.S. high schools became prominent in 1987, when a California student, Jenifer Graham, sued to require her school to let her complete an alternative project. The court ruled that mandatory dissections were permissible, but that Graham could ask to dissect a frog that had died of natural causes rather than one that was killed for the purposes of dissection; the practical impossibility of procuring a frog that had died of natural causes in effect let Graham opt out of the required dissection. The suit gave publicity to anti-dissection advocates. Graham appeared in a 1987 Apple Computer commercial for the virtual-dissection software Operation Frog. The state of California passed a Student&#x27;s Rights Bill in 1988 requiring that objecting students be allowed to complete alternative projects. Opting out of dissection increased through the 1990s.

In the United States, 17 states along with Washington, D.C. have enacted dissection-choice laws or policies that allow students in primary and secondary education to opt out of dissection. Other states including Arizona, Hawaii, Minnesota, Texas, and Utah have more general policies on opting out on moral, religious, or ethical grounds. To overcome these concerns, J. W. Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Florida, in 2019 became the first US high school to use synthetic frogs for dissection in its science classes, instead of preserved real frogs.

As for the dissection of cadavers in undergraduate and medical school, traditional dissection is supported by professors and students, with some opposition, limiting the availability of dissection. Upper-level students who have experienced this method along with their professors agree that &quot;Studying human anatomy with colorful charts is one thing. Using a scalpel and an actual, recently-living person is an entirely different matter.&quot;

==Acquisition of cadavers==
The way in which cadaveric specimens are obtained differs greatly according to country. In the UK, donation of a cadaver is wholly voluntary. Involuntary donation plays a role in about 20 percent of specimens in the US and almost all specimens donated in some countries such as South Africa and Zimbabwe. Countries that practice involuntary donation may make available the bodies of dead criminals or unclaimed or unidentified bodies for the purposes of dissection. Such practices may lead to a greater proportion of the poor, homeless and social outcasts being involuntarily donated. Cadavers donated in one jurisdiction may also be used for the purposes of dissection in another, whether across states in the US, or imported from other countries, such as with Libya. As an example of how a cadaver is donated voluntarily, a funeral home in conjunction with a voluntary donation program identifies a body who is part of the program. After broaching the subject with relatives in a diplomatic fashion, the body is then transported to a registered facility. The body is tested for the presence of HIV and hepatitis viruses. It is then evaluated for use as a &quot;fresh&quot; or &quot;prepared&quot; specimen.

==Disposal of specimens==
Cadaveric specimens for dissection are, in general, disposed of by cremation. The deceased may then be interred at a local cemetery. If the family wishes, the ashes of the deceased are then returned to the family. Many institutes have local policies to engage, support and celebrate the donors. This may include the setting up of local monuments at the cemetery.

==Use in education==

Human cadavers are often used in medicine to teach anatomy or surgical instruction. Cadavers are selected according to their anatomy and availability. They may be used as part of dissection courses involving a &quot;fresh&quot; specimen so as to be as realistic as possible—for example, when training surgeons. Cadavers may also be pre-dissected by trained instructors. This form of dissection involves the preparation and preservation of specimens for a longer time period and is generally used for the teaching of anatomy.

==Alternatives==

Some alternatives to dissection may present educational advantages over the use of animal cadavers, while eliminating perceived ethical issues. These alternatives include computer programs, lectures, three dimensional models, films, and other forms of technology. Concern for animal welfare is often at the root of objections to animal dissection. Studies show that some students reluctantly participate in animal dissection out of fear of real or perceived punishment or ostracism from their teachers and peers, and many do not speak up about their ethical objections.

One alternative to the use of cadavers is computer technology. At Stanford Medical School, software combines X-ray, ultrasound and MRI imaging for display on a screen as large as a body on a table. In a variant of this, a &quot;virtual anatomy&quot; approach being developed at New York University, students wear three dimensional glasses and can use a pointing device to &quot;[swoop] through the virtual body, its sections as brightly colored as living tissue.&quot; This method is claimed to be &quot;as dynamic as Imax [cinema]&quot;.
==Advantages and disadvantages==
Proponents of animal-free teaching methodologies argue that alternatives to animal dissection can benefit educators by increasing teaching efficiency and lowering instruction costs while affording teachers an enhanced potential for the customization and repeat-ability of teaching exercises. Those in favor of dissection alternatives point to studies which have shown that computer-based teaching methods &quot;saved academic and nonacademic staff time ... were considered to be less expensive and an effective and enjoyable mode of student learning [and]  ... contributed to a significant reduction in animal use&quot; because there is no set-up or clean-up time, no obligatory safety lessons, and no monitoring of misbehavior with animal cadavers, scissors, and scalpels.

With software and other non-animal methods, there is also no expensive disposal of equipment or hazardous material removal. Some programs also allow educators to customize lessons and include built-in test and quiz modules that can track student performance. Furthermore, animals (whether dead or alive) can be used only once, while non-animal resources can be used for many years—an added benefit that could result in significant cost savings for teachers, school districts, and state educational systems.

Several peer-reviewed comparative studies examining information retention and performance of students who dissected animals and those who used an alternative instruction method have concluded that the educational outcomes of students who are taught basic and advanced biomedical concepts and skills using non-animal methods are equivalent or superior to those of their peers who use animal-based laboratories such as animal dissection.

Some reports state that students&#x27; confidence, satisfaction, and ability to retrieve and communicate information was much higher for those who participated in alternative activities compared to dissection. Three separate studies at universities across the United States found that students who modeled body systems out of clay were significantly better at identifying the constituent parts of human anatomy than their classmates who performed animal dissection.

Another study found that students preferred using clay modeling over animal dissection and performed just as well as their cohorts who dissected animals.

In 2008, the National Association of Biology Teachers (NABT) affirmed its support for classroom animal dissection stating that they &quot;Encourage the presence of live animals in the classroom with appropriate consideration to the age and maturity level of the students ... NABT urges teachers to be aware that alternatives to dissection have their limitations. NABT supports the use of these materials as adjuncts to the educational process but not as exclusive replacements for the use of actual organisms.&quot;

The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) &quot;supports including live animals as part of instruction in the K-12 science classroom because observing and working with animals firsthand can spark students&#x27; interest in science as well as a general respect for life while reinforcing key concepts&quot; of biological sciences. NSTA also supports offering dissection alternatives to students who object to the practice.

The NORINA database lists over 3,000 products which may be used as alternatives or supplements to animal use in education and training. These include alternatives to dissection in schools. InterNICHE has a similar database and a loans system.

<text>Le Moyne College is a private Jesuit college mostly in DeWitt, New York. It was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1946, and named after Jesuit missionary Simon Le Moyne. Le Moyne was the first co-educational Jesuit college in the United States.

==History==
Founded by the Society of Jesus in 1946, and named after the Jesuit missionary Simon Le Moyne, the college has graduated more than 35,000 students . At its founding, Le Moyne was the first Jesuit co-educational college in the United States.

Walter A. Foery, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Syracuse, helped bring about the formation of Le Moyne College. Foery proposed to provide for the city of Syracuse &quot;a truly American school with religion and morality as the foundation stones&quot;. The college&#x27;s first home was a storefront on East Onondaga Street in Syracuse. Later, it moved to the Hiscock Mansion on James Street. The college moved to its current () campus in 1948.

In 2014, Linda LeMura, formerly the college&#x27;s provost and academic vice president, was appointed as the 14th president of Le Moyne College. LeMura is the first laywoman in history to serve as president of a Jesuit college or university.

As of 2020, the college enrolled more than 3,700 students. As of 2021, the college offers more than 30 majors, an evening program, a variety of graduate courses, and a doctoral program in executive leadership. In 2022, Le Moyne received 7,066 undergraduate applications, which represents an increase of 5.31% annually. There was an 78.3% acceptance rate with 5,531 students accepted.

Le Moyne College&#x27;s campus is mostly located in the De Witt census-designated place, in the suburban town of DeWitt, including all of the buildings used for academic purposes. A small portion of the campus is within the city of Syracuse. As of 2021, there are 35 buildings on the campus.

==Traditions==
===Welcoming traditions===
Le Moyne College begins every academic year with two rituals: (1) &#x27;Moving In Weekend,&#x27; when current students help to carry the boxes and suitcases of the new, first-year students into the dormitories; and (2) the Mass of the Holy Spirit, which continues a tradition dating back to the first Jesuit school, established in Messina, Sicily, in 1548 (probably preceding this date). The meaning of this Mass is based in Catholic theology; the campus community commits to seeking knowledge as a community of scholars.

===Dolphy Day===
Another annual tradition at Le Moyne College is &quot;Dolphy Day&quot;, which originated in 1971. Dolphy Day is named for Eric Dolphy and has been said to have been inspired by Frank Zappa&#x27;s song, &quot;The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue&quot;. Although Le Moyne&#x27;s mascot is a dolphin, campus officials say there is no direct relation between the name of this event and this college icon. Each year, a &quot;Wizard&quot; is chosen (by the preceding Wizard).

== Green initiatives ==
Environmental sustainability is integrated into Le Moyne College facilities planning and operating processes. 
In June 2010, the college began construction on a new, science facility. The science complex provides teaching and research space for use by faculty and students in the science and health professions. Its environmentally-sound design features include day lighting, solar preheating, and thermal storage, resulting in the award of LEED-Gold certification.

== Athletics ==

The Le Moyne Dolphins are the athletic teams for the college. As of July 1, 2023, Le Moyne competes in NCAA Division I as a member of the Northeast Conference (NEC). Previously, Le Moyne competed in the NCAA at the Division II level through the 2022–23 school year with 21 varsity teams, offering participation opportunities for over 340 students. Since 2003, Le Moyne men&#x27;s lacrosse has won six NCAA Division II national championships. Previously, Le Moyne competed in the Northeast-10 Conference in all sports, but started a transition to Division I on July 1, 2023, as a new member of the NEC. All Le Moyne teams compete in the NEC.

<text>Narre Warren North is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 36 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Casey local government area. Narre Warren North recorded a population of 8,033 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Before the construction of the Gippsland railway line, Narre Warren North was actually the location of the Narre Warren township. The construction of Narre Warren railway station, however, moved the township 2 km to the south, as happened with Upper Beaconsfield, Clyde North and many other townships.

Reflecting this, Narre Warren Post Office opened on 21 January 1869 and in 1900 was renamed Narre Warren North, and Narre Warren Railway Station office (open since 1886) was renamed Narre Warren.

==Sport==

Berwick City Soccer Club play their home games at Jack Thomas Reserve which is located in the suburb of Narre Warren North. They currently complete in the Victorian State League Division 2 South East.

Narre Warren North Foxes Football Club is a Junior Football Club that is also located in the suburb of Narre Warren North. They train and play at the Narre Warren North Recreation Reserve located on Belgrave-Hallam Road.

<doc id="611240" wikidata="Q7157991" url="?curid=611240" title="Pearcedale, Victoria">
<text>Pearcedale is a town in Victoria, Australia, 49 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Casey and the Shire of Mornington Peninsula local government areas. Pearcedale recorded a population of 3,867 at the 2021 census.

A bus service operates to and from Frankston station via Baxter as well as a service to Cranbourne station via Botanic Ridge.

==Geography==

Pearcedale is a township and rural locality on the northwestern corner of Western Port, in the northern extremities of the Mornington Peninsula. The land is relatively flat with a rich and sandy soil type ideal for market gardening. Its mangrove saltmarsh coastline on Watson Inlet, west of Quail Island, includes the Langwarrin Creek estuary as well as numerous other small creek estuaries. These mangrove saltmarshes are of international significance and are incorporated within the Yaringa Marine National Park as well as being protected under the United Nations Ramsar Convention. The mangrove saltmarshes are not accessible, by land, to the public.

==History==
===General===

Pearcedale was originally called Langwarrin and was also known at various times as Langwarrin Estate or Old Langwarrin. When the Mornington and Stony Point railway lines opened in the late 1880s, the railway station near the Military Camp (now a Flora and Fauna Reserve) was named Langwarrin. A new town developed east of the railway station and was locally called New Langwarrin. A meeting of rate payers was held in November 1905 and it was voted to rename the original town Pearcedale, to avoid confusion with this new settlement of New Langwarrin. The name Pearcedale came from local landowner Nathaniel Pearce. Nathaniel and his wife Mary Grace are first listed in the Shire of Cranbourne Rate Books in 1894, when they purchased an orchard on 26 acres (about 10 hectares) at Langwarrin Estate. They had eight children. Mary was a midwife and helped deliver many babies in the area.

The town of Pearcedale had a slow beginning. In 1889 it had a few shops and a post office, public hall and primary school. However, the 1890s depression affected the town, and the school closed in 1892, and the post office in 1893. The school re-opened in 1902 and the post office in 1907. The original hall burnt down and the replacement was opened on 23 August 1918. This event was witnessed by 400 people, who were entertained with a concert and a dance which finished at 4:00 am. The Methodist church was opened in 1918, the Anglican church in 1938. Other Community milestones include the establishment of the tennis club in the 1920s, the cricket club in 1921, the football club in 1929, the Progress Association in 1937 and the fire brigade in 1940. Electricity was connected in 1957, the Guides and Scouts both formed in 1957, the R.S.L in 1958 and the Infant Welfare Centre in 1961. Town water was connected in 1962.

===Meteorites===
A meteorite known as Cranbourne meteorite No.11 was found 2 kilometres north north-east of Pearcedale and 5 kilometres east-south east of the Langwarrin Railway Station. The meteorite weighed a massive 762 kilograms and was reportedly found in 1903, just below the surface of the ground. The find was not reported at the time and, from all accounts the meteorite was kept in the possession of the finder until 1938, when it was sold to the U.S. National Museum, Washington.

Another known as Cranbourne meteorite No.12 was discovered in April 1982 it was donated to the then Shire Council for display purposes. This meteorite was first found in 1927 but only recently came to scientific notice. Weighing 23 kilograms it has been registered in the collections of the National Museum of Victoria and is on a long-term loan to the City of Casey, for display purposes. It was found on a property located on the north-east corner of Pearcedale Road, Pearcedale.

In 2013 Cranbourne meteorite 13 was found at the intersection of North Road and Pearcedale Road. CSIRO took possession shortly after and it has since been classified as the third largest Mars based meteorite found in the southern hemisphere.

==Culture==

The town is surrounded by many horse and hobby properties, market gardens, cattle, egg and poultry farms. Much of the locality is zoned as &quot;green wedge&quot; and therefore future urban development in the region is limited. Pearcedale Primary School is notable as being the regional school responsible for the teaching of children impaired by hearing loss. The school has an enrolment of over 600 students and is widely acknowledged as being of high standard.

Local attractions include the multiple award-winning Moonlit Sanctuary Wildlife Conservation Park, which operates during the daytime and has special evening tours that allow visitors to see endangered Australian animals. Moonlit Sanctuary is part of the Official Mornington Peninsula Tourism Guide.

The RSPCA Peninsula Adoption Centre &amp; Shelter is based in Pearcedale. Here employees and volunteers care for homeless cats and dogs as well as rescued horses and ponies from the Peninsula region. There is also a public veterinary clinic in operation at the facility.

One of the largest herb farms in the southern hemisphere, Coolibah Herbs, is based in Pearcedale. It supplies washed salad greens, mixed leaves and a variety of culinary herbs and vegetables to leading companies in the food service sector. It has numerous farms across the Mornington Peninsula and Gippsland.

Pearcedale has its own Country Fire Authority station that draws on the local community for volunteers.

===Transport===

Public Transport Victoria through Ventura operates route 776, a service to and from Frankston railway station, via Frankston South, Baxter and Langwarrin South, and route 792 (operated by Cranbourne Transit), which runs to Cranbourne, via Botanic Ridge. 

Yaringa Marina, located a short drive south-east of the township in neighbouring Somerville, provides boat access to Western Port.

===Shopping===

Pearcedale Village Shopping Centre on Baxter-Tooradin Road is a small retail development.

The Pearcedale Farmers Market operates outdoors on a seasonal schedule.

===Sport===

With its convenient proximity to Cranbourne, Mornington and metropolitan racecourses Pearcedale is home to numerous racehorse trainers, jockeys and others associated with Victoria&#x27;s thoroughbred racing industry. A number of greyhound and harness racing trainers also reside in the area.

Equestrian trails and private agistment facilities provide many equestrian enthusiasts with the opportunity to enjoy their craft. Local pony clubs provide dressage, show jumping and cross-country facilities for young equestrian enthusiasts. Pearcedale Pony Club hold a rally for its members on the second Sunday of each month.

==Naming==

The name of Tooradin comes from the Boon wurrung word &quot;too-roo-dun&quot;, which refers to the Bunyip that lived in the Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp. The Dreamtime creature had a &#x27;reputation for devouring human beings&#x27; and &#x27;lived in the thick mud beneath the water of a waterhole that never dried up.&#x27; 

==History==

The explorer William Hovell visited the area in 1827, he saw evidence of Van Diemens Land sealers had left at their temporary camps on the foreshore of Western Port Bay. The sealers had been operating since the early 1800s.

In 1839 saw settlers with their cattle establish runs and settle in the area. Work commenced at draining swamps and improving drainage for pasture. The township was first surveyed in 1854.

Tooradin has always been a fishing village that nestled on the foreshore. The Post Office opened on 21 May 1877.

The railway passed by north of the town by 2 1/2 miles in 1885. A station was created and the fishing industry relied heavily on the railway to transport freshly caught fish to Melbourne. The railways also transported local produce, cattle, sheep and crops were raised on the land and sent to market.

==Today==

The town has some attractions such as Sawtell&#x27;s Inlet, and an old historic weatherboard Fishermans Cottage. It is a popular stopping place for people travelling to Phillip Island.

The town in conjunction with neighbouring township Dalmore has an Australian Rules football team (Tooradin-Dalmore) competing in the West Gippsland Football Netball Competition.

==Transport==
Tooradin railway station was formerly situated on the South Gippsland railway corridor that operated to its terminus at Yarram in the early 1980s and Leongatha in the mid 1990s. A V/Line road coach service replaced the rail service to Leongatha on 24 July 1993, running between Melbourne and Yarram. However, since the closure of the South Gippsland rail line—with the exception of the locally run tourist railway between Nyora and Leongatha (this section of line closed in 2015) by the Kennett Victorian government in 1993, the South and West Gippsland Transport Group represented by the local council had campaigned over the following two decades for the rail services to be reinstated beyond the current terminus at Cranbourne, which was promised by the Bracks government in 1999.

Cranbourne Transit operates Route 795 services on weekdays to Cranbourne via Warneet five times a day, with morning services running through Warneet prior to arriving at Tooradin. There are currently no weekend services.
