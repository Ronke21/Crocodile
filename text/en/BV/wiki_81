<text>Canmore is a town in Alberta, Canada, located approximately west of Calgary near the southeast boundary of Banff National Park. It is located in the Bow Valley within Alberta&#x27;s Rocky Mountains. The town shares a border with Kananaskis Country to the west and south and the Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8 to the north and east. With a population of 17,036 in 2023, Canmore is the fifth-largest town in Alberta.

==History==
Canmore was officially named in 1884 by Canadian Pacific Railway director Donald A. Smith (later 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal). It was named after Malcolm III of Scotland who was also nicknamed Canmore. The name Canmore originates from the Gaelic &quot;ceann mòr&quot;, meaning &quot;Big Chief&quot;.

In 1886, Queen Victoria granted a coal mining charter to the town, and the No. 1 mine was opened in 1887.

By the 1890s, a North-West Mounted Police barrack had been instated on Main Street, however, it was vacated in 1927. The building was restored in 1989 and it is under the care of the Canmore Museum and Geoscience Centre.

The coal mining industry in Canmore boomed well into the 20th century. In 1965, with a population of 2,000, Canmore was incorporated as a town. By the 1970s, the market for coal was diminished, and in 1979 Canmore Mines Ltd. ceased operations. As a result of safety and reclamation policies instigated by the province of Alberta, all but a few mining structures were demolished in the following year; only the lamp house and a few mine entrances remain today.

Canmore&#x27;s economic future seemed dismal until the announcement in the early 1980s that Calgary would be hosting the 1988 Winter Olympics, and that Canmore would play host to the Nordic events. This resulted in an increase in tourism, and Canmore began to develop into the recreational tourist destination it is today.

The Canmore Hotel was built in 1890 on the main street. In 2015, the building received a heritage designation and was being renovated to restore it. The hotel celebrated its 120th anniversary in October 2010.

Canmore is known by the Nakoda people as &quot;Chuwapchipchiyan Kude Bi&quot;. Applications requesting that this be made an official name have thus far been unsuccessful.

== Geography ==
Concerns over Canmore&#x27;s urban growth adjacent to provincial and national parkland has led to many efforts to place a limit on future development. The town was at one time expected to reach its maximum &quot;build out&quot; following the completion of Silvertip Resort and Three Sisters Mountain Village developments by 2020, but developers have continued the push for permits to construct additional housing. In 2021 the developers of the Three Sisters Mountain Village project sued the town of Canmore for $161 million over a decision that prevented them from building the project. In May 2022, the Land and Property Rights Tribunal of Alberta overruled town officials and ordered that development for the two projects can proceed to completion.

Bisected by the Trans-Canada Highway, located on the Canadian Pacific Kansas City railway and run through by the Bow River, Canmore is ideally situated on a number of major transportation routes, which has influenced its tourism-based economy and historical mining industry.

Much of the Canmore area has been designated a wildlife corridor. This corridor allows animals such as bears, cougars, wolves, and elk to move between habitat patches, where they can find food, escape predators, breed, give birth, and establish territories.

Despite its modest population and environmentally friendly image, Canmore is highly sprawled and segmented (due to wildlife corridors, highways, the railway, and the Bow River) and takes over one and a half hours to traverse on foot. The pedestrian-friendly town centre surrounds 8th Street, or &quot;Main Street&quot; (as it is known colloquially), which was originally a residential road with some of the oldest architecture in the town; now, however, it is lined with small shops, restaurants, and galleries. Much of the recent development is taking place in Three Sisters Mountain Village, Silvertip Resort, and around the town centre.

A series of hiking, mountain biking, equestrian, and paved trails traverse the Canmore area. Major trail systems are located on the Benchlands of Mount Lady Macdonald, at the Canmore Nordic Centre, and along the north slope of Mount Lawrence Grassi. Many of these trails, and others around the community, are located within Bow Valley Wildland Provincial Park and Kananaskis Country. Some of these, including the Montaine Traverse Trail and the Highline Trail, have been improved by the Town of Canmore, the Government of Alberta, the Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8, and various stakeholders (Bow Valley Mountain Bike Alliance, the B.V. Riding Association, and local hiking groups) in order to balance recreational opportunities with environmental sustainability. Much of the upgrading has been accomplished by volunteers organized by the Trail Care Program of The Friends of Kananaskis Country.

Mountains located adjacent to and visible from the townsite are:

* Mount Rundle ()
** East End of Rundle
* Mount Lawrence Grassi (2,685 m / 8,809 ft)
** Ha Ling Peak ()
* Three Sisters (2,936 m, 2,769 m, 2,694 m or 9,633 ft, 9,084 ft, 8,839 ft)

The facility offers an 8-lane 25m lap pool, a world class climbing wall developed by Walltopia, two cardio rooms, a strength room, and a host of fitness programs. Elevation Place also houses the community&#x27;s library and a local art gallery.

=== Canmore Nordic Centre ===
The Canmore Nordic Centre was originally constructed for the 1988 Winter Olympic Games. Cross-country skiing, biathlon, Nordic combined, and blind cross-country skiing events were held here.
The Canmore Nordic Centre provides world-class trails for use by cross-country skiers, mountain bikers, unicyclists, trail runners, roller skiers, and hikers. It also has disc golf courses and orienteering. It has provincial park status and is administered by Alberta Parks. The centre was re-developed for the 2005 Cross-country World Cup and future international events. The Nordic Centre hosts national training camps for Canada&#x27;s biathlon and cross-country ski teams, in addition to providing winter and summer recreational facilities to the general public. It has some of world-class cross-country and biathlon trail systems designed to meet international Nordic competitive standards.

=== Grassi Lakes ===
The Upper &amp; Lower Grassi Lakes lie at an elevation of about 1,525 m in the southern Canadian Rockies overlooking the town of Canmore, Alberta. They receive their water from natural springs.

=== Banff National Park ===
Canmore is the closest major town to Banff National Park, the main gate of which is just northwest of the town limits. It is a 22-kilometre drive from Canmore to the park&#x27;s main townsite at Banff.

== Sports ==

Climbing is popular with traditional, sport and multi-pitch climbs throughout the Bow Valley, and the area is a destination for ice climbing.

The local Alberta Junior Hockey League team is the Canmore Eagles. In 2001, Canmore resident and Eagles goalie &quot;Double Blocker&quot; Dan Blackburn, was drafted into the National Hockey League to play for the New York Rangers. The two-time Stanley Cup-winner Brayden Point has played for Eagles. The local Bantam hockey team is the Canmore Eagles. The hockey movie &quot;Mystery, Alaska&quot; (1999) was filmed in Canmore.

Canmore is the official home to the Canadian National cross-country skiing and biathlon teams. This, combined with the Canmore Nordic Centre has resulted in the town becoming a magnet for aspiring athletes in both sports. Full and part-time athletes can be seen training around town and in the local area all year around.

On February 22, 2006, Canmore local Chandra Crawford won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s cross-country 1.1-kilometre sprint at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Beckie Scott, gold medalist in the women&#x27;s cross country skiing pursuit race in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah also makes her home in Canmore.

The Canmore Nordic Centre is a destination for many large sporting events. During the summer season, mountain bike races (including the World 24 Hour championships in 2009 and the Canadian National Championships in 2010) are held there. During the winter season, the facility sees several cross-country ski races, ranging from local events to the FIS World Cup in 2005, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2016.

Canmore United is the local soccer team, participating in the summer Bow Valley Soccer League, as well as tournaments in British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Alberta.

The Canmore Youth Skate Park was built in the summer of 2009.

== Media ==

The primary newspapers for the town are the Rocky Mountain Outlook and the Bow Valley Crag and Canyon which took over the Canmore Leader and the Banff Crag &amp; Canyon in 2013. The only radio station operating out of Canmore is CHMN-FM, an adult contemporary station run by Rogers Media. Former Much Music VJ, Bradford How was employed by the Rogers owned, Mountain FM (broadcast at 106.5 FM) before he won the MuchMusic VJ Search competition in 2000.

== Housing ==

Many of the new developments, fractional projects, and vacation suites were built with sustainable development in mind, and in 2006 the Three Sisters Mountain Village development was the recipient of an international award for being the best sustainable development in North America. Unfortunately, new owners of the &#x27;future land assets&#x27; of this project defaulted on their financial commitments following the world economic crisis, putting the future development lands into receivership in the spring of 2009, but this does not affect current developments that are ongoing within the project and long-term development will eventually continue under new ownership. In early 2010, several projects are beginning to show signs of life, and real estate pricing has begun to recover.

As of June 2014 Canmore has the lowest vacancy rate in Canada for rental properties according to a CMHC Spring report. This in turn is having an effect on the housing market and pushing prices up. Along with the uptick in the oil industry and second home buyers coming back into the market from Calgary, the housing market is showing signs of not only recovering but becoming very strong as inventory levels are at a 6-year low.

Within the town, there are also some buildings using geothermal energy, and the town&#x27;s new Municipal Services Building is the first building in Alberta to achieve LEED Silver certification status.

However, due to the local landscape being very complex, not everyone can install solar or wind energy devices on their property. Bylaws are also very strict and &quot;aesthetic alterations&quot; are not widely accepted.

Canmore is a very difficult place to find affordable housing, and pet owners or families may have difficulty arranging accommodation. To alleviate the housing crunch, Canmore has pursued several affordable housing projects. In 2000, the Town of Canmore established the Canmore Community Housing Corporation (CCHC) to provide housing solutions for a healthy and balanced community. CCHC administers a Perpetually Affordable Housing (PAH) Program consisting of 41 ownership and 60 rental housing units at below-market purchase prices and rental rates. Mountain Haven Co-operative Homes Ltd. administers its own PAH development that provides 44 equity and non-equity (lease to own) units.

<doc id="628276" wikidata="Q1088689" url="?curid=628276" title="Chrysler Crossfire">
<text>The Chrysler Crossfire is a rear-wheel drive, two-seat sports car, marketed by Chrysler and manufactured by Karmann of Germany for the 2004 through 2008 model years.

Developed during the period when Chrysler and Mercedes Benz had merged, known as Daimler Chrysler, the two-seater uses the Mercedes-Benz R170 platform and shares 80% of its components with the first generation SLK. The second generation SLK was built on the R171 platform with model year 2005; the R170 platform was essentially handed down to Chrysler for the Crossfire. Having initially arrived in 2001 as a concept car styled by Eric Stoddard, the Chrysler was further refined by Andrew Dyson before production began in 2003 for 2004 model year sales.

== Design ==
The name &quot;Crossfire&quot; refers to two character lines that run from front to rear along the body sides, prominently crossing below the mirrors on the door panels. Conceived during the period of Daimler Chrysler, the name also refers to the collaboration of the two companies.


The Chrysler Crossfire concept car was introduced at the 2001 North American International Auto Show and the production version was unveiled at the 2002 Los Angeles Auto Show as a 2004 model &quot;is as faithful a translation from concept to production as any in recent memory.&quot; The concept car was designed &quot;to evoke a strong, passionate, emotional response. We had to retain that. We want to polarize our audience—we want people to love it or hate it.&quot; 

Conceived as a two-seat halo car for the Chrysler brand, the marketing objective was also to make use of available components using a two-seat roadster chassis. The production car shares about 39% of its parts with Mercedes-Benz vehicles and Chrysler dealers were required to invest in special equipment, tools, and parts to be able to market the new luxury model. The rear-wheel-drive Crossfire coupe styling objective was for a &quot;unique, almost sculptural&quot; design.

The Crossfire &#x27;s styling includes a wide stance with 19-inch rear wheels and 18-inch front wheels. Automotive journalists compared the Crossfire to American Motors&#x27; 1965–1967 AMC Marlin. Noted journalist, Paul Leinert said the &quot;distinctive boat-tail rear end reminds more than one observer of the old Rambler Marlin.&quot; For example, Rob Rothwell wrote &quot;... when I first espied the rear lines of the Chrysler Crossfire I was instantly transported back to 1965 and my favorite car of that year, the Rambler Marlin.&quot; &quot;Motor Trend&quot; also compared the &quot;provocative boattail theme&quot; of the 2004 Crossfire&#x27;s sheetmetal to that of the AMC Marlin fastback. The Crossfire&#x27;s tail is &quot;formed as the edges of the roof converge into a kind of teardrop shape, leaving the rear fenders to flare out over the rear wheels.&quot;

Chrysler said the Crossfire took inspiration from the 1930s art deco period and buildings such as the Chrysler Building. Motor Trend cites vehicle influences from 1930s including Bugattis and the Talbot Lago. Chrysler wanted to once again offer a performance coupe reminiscent of the luxury reputation they enjoyed during the late 1950s to mid-1960s with the Chrysler 300 letter series coupes and convertibles.

== Mechanical design ==


Chrysler executed the interior and exterior styling. All other elements of the car such as wheelbase, track, engine, transmission, chassis structure, suspension components, are shared with the R170 platform. For example, the engine bay of the Crossfire is virtually identical to the Mercedes-Benz SLK320 on the R170 platform. The seats from the Mercedes-Benz SLK320 would bolt directly into the Crossfire chassis. The dashboard layout, controls, and instruments are also similar to those on the Mercedes-Benz SLK320.

The standard transmission is a 6-speed manual with an optional 5-speed automatic. Base (standard) and Limited models, originally offered beginning in the 2004 model year, were equipped with a Mercedes-Benz M112 3.2 L, 18-valve, SOHC V6 engine that was rated by Chrysler at and of torque.

The SRT-6 models were equipped with a supercharged version of the M112 engine built by Mercedes&#x27; performance branch, AMG. The SRT-6 models came only with the 5-speed automatic transmission, consistent with AMG cars of the same era. The 6-speed transmission used by the Chrysler Crossfire is a variant of the Mercedes sourced NSG-370. The 5-speed automatic transmission in the Crossfire (known as 5G-Tronic) is also Mercedes-sourced and a variant of the 722.6 family. The automatic transmission-equipped Crossfires achieve a better EPA fuel efficiency rating over the 6MT, mostly due to the difference in gear ratios.

The Crossfire uses the recirculating ball steering system from the R170 platform. Front suspension is unequal length (SLA) double wishbone suspension with 5 point multi-link in the rear. As with the concept car, all Crossfire models used two different wheel sizes measuring 18x7.5-inch on the front and 19x9-inch on the rear. Standard all-season tires were 225/40R18 on the front and 255/35R19 on the rear.

The first production Crossfire was assembled on 3 February 2003, and driven off the production line by Chrysler Group&#x27;s COO Wolfgang Bernhard in Germany.

== Equipment ==
The Chrysler Crossfire&#x27;s standard features included large alloy wheels with performance-rated tires, a Becker–sourced AM/FM stereo with anti-theft system and a single-disc CD player, keyless entry with security alarm, a power-retractable rear wing spoiler, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power front sports bucket seats, full instrumentation, a 3.2 L V6 engine with a manual transmission, rear-wheel-drive (RWD), a leather-wrapped and stitched steering wheel, a power-retractable cloth convertible roof (for convertible models), front floor mats, and air conditioning.

Optional features included an automatic transmission, a six-speaker premium Infinity sound system with two &quot;subwoofers&quot; mounted directly behind each seat, a CD-based GPS navigational system, exterior paint colors, and additional interior color choices.

== Sales and production numbers ==
The original contract with Karmann to build the Crossfire was for about five years with an annual sales target of 20,000 units in the United States. Sales of the Crossfire were slow, with an average 230-day supply of the vehicles during November 2005. A small number of Crossfires were imported to the United States and Mexico in 2006 (and almost all of these were roadsters).

Chrysler discontinued the Crossfire after the 2008 model year, as part of its restructuring plans. The last Crossfire was assembled on 17 December 2007.

:&quot;Notes:&quot;
: LHD = Left hand drive (steering wheel on the left side)
: RHD = Right hand drive (steering wheel on the right side)
: Crossfire Coupe and Crossfire Roadster refer to the &quot;Base&quot; model
: &quot;Note: Cars produced in one calendar year may be marketed as the following model year. &quot;

== Models ==
===Base and Limited ===
For model year 2004, only the coupe was offered in a single trim level, equipped similarly to the following year&#x27;s Limited model. 

For model year 2005 model year; Coupe and Roadster configurations were available, each with three ascending trim levels: Base, Limited, and SRT-6 (supercharged). Base Crossfires, Coupe or Roadster, featured matte black painted windshield frames, black filler plugs (in place of fog lights) in the front fascia, and fabric seats with separate, movable headrests. Limited and SRT-6 models, both Coupe and Roadster, all featured silver-painted windshield frames and are equipped with fog lights. The Limited trim level featured leather upholstery. The SRT-6 model offered leather/Alcantara upholstery. All Base and Limited Crossfire models included an electronic rear wing that would automatically deploy at about 65 mph and descend at 45 mph. A manual override switch raised or lowered the spoiler at any speed.

For model years 2006-2007, an SE Roadster model (essentially a base model) was offered in Blaze Red Crystal Pearl and with black accented 15-spoke SRT-6 style wheels. 

=== SRT-6 ===
The SRT-6 trim level, available as a coupe and convertible, featured a Mercedes-Benz AMG M112 3.2 L V6 supercharged engine delivering and of torque. Other SRT-6 model-specific features included suspension and brake modifications, a front fascia air dam, and a fixed rear spoiler. The SRT-6 used the same drivetrain, suspension, and braking components as those used on the Mercedes-Benz SLK 32 AMG. The standard tires were upgraded to Z-rated Michelin Pilot Sports, sized 225/40R18 on the front and 255/35R19s in the back. The SRT-6 cars did not feature the electronic wing that the Base and Standard cars featured.

For model year 2006, the SRT-6 was special order only.

<text>Steven Jay Shelley (born June 23, 1962) is an American drummer. He is best known as the longtime drummer of the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, for whom he played from 1985 until their 2011 disbandment.

==Biography==
Shelley was born in Midland, Michigan and played in several mid-Michigan bands, including Faith and Morals and Strange Fruit, and was among the original lineup of the punk band The Crucifucks. Since 1985, he has performed with the noise rock band Sonic Youth, when he replaced Bob Bert.

After leaving the Crucifucks, he moved to Manhattan with a friend, living in the apartment of Sonic Youth&#x27;s Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon for dog sitting purposes while the band was in Europe. When the band returned, former drummer Bob Bert had left the band, and they hired Shelley as their drummer without an audition.

In 1992 he founded the independent record label Smells Like Records, based in Hoboken, New Jersey.

Along with friend and Two Dollar Guitar musician Tim Foljahn, he helped advance Cat Power&#x27;s musical career, serving as drummer on her first three albums. He also produced Blonde Redhead&#x27;s debut self-titled album in 1995.
Steve was able to track down Lee Hazlewood in 1997 and secure permission to reissue five of the finest titles of the Hazlewood back catalog.

<text>Siegburg (i.e. &quot;fort on the Sieg river&quot;; Ripuarian: &quot;Sieburch&quot;) is a city in the district of Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located on the banks of the rivers Sieg and Agger, from the former seat of West German government Bonn and from Cologne. The population of the city was 39,192 in the 2013 census.

==Geography==
Siegburg is located approximately east of the river Rhine, at the confluence where the Agger joins the Sieg, in the southeast corner of the Cologne Lowland. Neighbouring towns include Troisdorf, Lohmar, Sankt Augustin and Hennef. The nearby cities of Cologne and Bonn are easily accessible through good transport links. The highest point of the urban area is above sea level (NHN) in the Braschoß area and the lowest point is just under above sea level at the mouth of the Agger.

==History==
Archbishop-Elector Anno II of Cologne founded a Benedictine monastery in 1064, known as Michaelsberg Abbey, on top of the hill also called the Michaelsberg. A settlement that arose from that was first mentioned as a city in 1182. Siegburg reached the height of its prosperity in the 15th and 16th century. It is famous for its pottery, especially for the Siegburg pitchers (&quot;Siegburger Krüge&quot;).

Siegburg has been the county seat of the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis since 1816.

Siegburg&#x27;s synagogue was destroyed on Kristallnacht, signaling the demise of its Jewish community.

==Politics==

Municipal elections are held every five years, in which the mayor and city council of Siegburg, as well as the district administrator () and district council () of the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis are chosen. The last election took place on 13 September 2020.

===City council===

The city council () of Siegburg consists of 50 councillors, half of which are chosen directly in 25 constituencies. The remaining 25 seats are distributed via party lists, resulting in a proportional representation.

On 30 October 2020 the Social Democrats, Greens, and Liberals agreed to form a coalition government.

===Mayor===
The mayor of Siegburg is Stefan Rosemann, who was elected with 57.54% of the vote. He stated that he would withdraw from party politics and completely focus on the mayoral office. He was sworn into office on 5 November 2020.

==Transport==
Siegburg/Bonn station is a railway station on the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed railway and the Sieg Railway. The name of the station derives from it having been rebuilt for the high-speed line in order to serve Bonn. It is connected to Bonn by the Siegburg line of the Bonn Stadtbahn every 10 or 15 minutes. The station is located in the network area of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg (Rhine-Sieg Transport Association, VRS) public transit authority.

<doc id="628302" wikidata="Q3129984" url="?curid=628302" title="Helter Skelter (1976 film)">
<text>Helter Skelter is a 1976 American true crime drama thriller television film based on the 1974 book by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi and Curt Gentry. In the United States, it aired over two nights. In some countries it was shown in cinemas, with additional footage including nudity, foul language, and more violence.

The movie is based on the murders committed by the Charles Manson Family. The best-known victim was pregnant actress Sharon Tate. The title was taken from the 1968 Beatles&#x27; song of the same name. According to the theory put forward by the prosecution, Manson used the term for an anticipated race war, and &quot;healter skelter&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;] was scrawled in blood on the refrigerator door at the home of victims Rosemary and Leno LaBianca. It recounts the murders Manson committed, the investigation, and the 1970-71 trial, in which prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi attempted to draw connections between the Manson family and his violent convictions.

The 1976 film, directed by Tom Gries, stars Steve Railsback as Manson and George DiCenzo as Bugliosi. Writer JP Miller received a 1977 Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for Best TV Feature or Mini-series Teleplay.

In 2004, the book was adapted for a second made-for-TV movie, written and directed by John Gray and featuring Jeremy Davies as Manson.

==Plot==
William Garretson is arrested following the discovery of the bodies of Sharon Tate and her guests at her home but is released three days later for lack of evidence. The police are unwilling to connect the Tate killings to the Hinman murder and LaBianca killings, despite the similarities of the crime scenes including writing in blood on the walls, and instead pursue a drug-related angle for the Tate killings.

The police raid Spahn Ranch in an attempt to break up an auto theft ring and arrest Manson and his gang. Nine-year-old &quot;Steven Quint&quot; (based on 10-year-old Steven Weiss) discovers a gun and his father turns it over to the police, where it is ignored. The Manson Family is released from prison and later two girls fleeing from Death Valley, &quot;Stephanie Mark&quot; (based on Stephanie Schram) and Kitty Lutesinger, tell police that the Manson Family has moved to Barker Ranch and that Susan Atkins was involved in the Hinman murder. Susan is arrested and reveals to her fellow inmate Ronnie Howard that she also killed Sharon Tate and was involved in eleven other killings.

Los Angeles District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi interviews Danny DeCarlo, who gives a tour of Spahn Ranch and says that Manson had a .22 caliber Buntline revolver matching that used in the murders. Ronnie Howard calls the homicide division and tells them what Susan confessed to her. Bugliosi requests bail to be set high for Manson&#x27;s trial for burning municipal earthmoving equipment in order to give him time to get evidence for the grand jury for the murders.

Bugliosi interviews the Manson Girls and obtains arrest warrants for participants in the killings. Linda Kasabian turns herself in on the warrant while the fingerprints of Tex Watson and Patricia Krenwinkel are matched to those found at the Tate residence. During the grand jury proceedings, Susan gives all of the details of the Tate and LaBianca killings. As a result, Susan, Leslie Van Houten, Tex, Patricia, Linda, and Manson are all brought up on charges.

A reporter and photographer from KABC-TV, Los Angeles attempting to retrace the events crime as reported in the newspaper find where the bloody clothes from the murders have been discarded. Steven&#x27;s father calls to ask about the .22 revolver, but the police tell him that they don&#x27;t have time for him and hang up on him. He tells the story to the news in order to embarrass the investigators. Bugliosi uses ballistics testing to link the gun to the one used on victim Jay Sebring.

Manson chooses to represent himself at trial and Bugliosi tricks Manson into requesting more time, thus also giving himself more time to put a stronger case together. Bugliosi interviews former Manson Family member Paul Watkins, who explains Manson&#x27;s views that the Beatles are sending him messages to spark a race war dubbed &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;.

During the trial, testimony is heard from Linda Kasabian regarding the Tate and LaBianca murders despite repeated objections from the counsel for the defense. At one point Manson leaps at the judge but is subdued. He demands to give testimony, much of which works to his disadvantage. Due to their continuous disruptions, the defendants are ordered out of the courtroom during the closing arguments. Ultimately all of the defendants are sentenced to death but California later eliminates the death penalty in 1972, making the convicts eligible to apply for parole in the future.

<text>The Anubis Gates is a 1983 time travel fantasy novel by American writer Tim Powers. It won the 1983 Philip K. Dick Award and 1984 Science Fiction Chronicle Award.
The plot concerns an English professor, who participates in a time travel experiment and ends up trapped in the 19th century. The novel was influenced by Mayhew&#x27;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot; and, to a lesser degree, the works of Charles Dickens.

== Plot summary ==
In 1801 the British have risen to power in Egypt and suppress the worship of the old Egyptian gods. A cabal of magicians plan to drive the British out of Egypt by bringing the gods forward in time from an age when they were still powerful and unleashing them on London, thereby destroying the British Empire. In 1802, a failed attempt by the magicians to summon Anubis opens magical gates in a predictable pattern across time and space.

In 1983, ailing millionaire J. Cochran Darrow has discovered the gates and found that they make time travel possible. Darrow organizes a trip to the past for fellow millionaires to attend a lecture by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1810. He hires Professor Brendan Doyle to attend and give expert commentary. One of the magicians, Doctor Romany, happens to spy the time travelers and kidnaps Doyle before he can return. Doyle manages to escape torture and flees back to London, now trapped in the 19th century.

Doyle joins a beggars&#x27; guild and meets a beggar named Jacky. He plans to meet and befriend William Ashbless, a wealthy poet that Doyle has studied profusely, in order to gain a benefactor. Doctor Romany scours the city for Doyle with his legion of murderous beggars, led by the clown-magician Horrabin. At the same time, Doyle discovers that Darrow has remained in the 19th century to search for Dog-Face Joe, a body-swapping werewolf, in hopes of bribing Joe into granting him a healthy new body. Doyle himself becomes targeted by Joe, receiving the poisoned body of Darrow&#x27;s former bodyguard, but manages to cure himself of the poison.

In his new body, Doyle realizes that he himself is the historical Ashbless. He copies down Ashbless&#x27;s poetry from memory and deduces his own future from his study of Ashbless&#x27;s life. Using this knowledge, he continues to thwart the magicians&#x27; plans. After Romany discovers a gate to 1684, Doyle follows him through and stops his attempt to change the past. Meanwhile, Darrow successfully contacts Dog-Face Joe and organizes a deal in which Joe will provide Darrow with healthy bodies and allow him to live forever.

Doyle eventually returns to 1810, but is kidnapped and taken to Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Egypt, where the magicians&#x27; Master tempts him with resurrecting his dead wife if he will tell them the secrets of the time-gates. Doyle resists and kills the Master. Meanwhile, Jacky discovers Darrow&#x27;s secret and kills him along with Dog-Face Joe. Doyle returns to London, where the last magician, Romanelli, kidnaps him, Jacky, and Coleridge. In a drugged stupor, Coleridge frees Horrabin&#x27;s twisted menagerie of monsters, allowing him and Jacky to escape. Romanelli escapes with Doyle to the underworld, but is eaten by Apep while Doyle is rejuvenated on board the sunboat of the god Ra. Doyle meets back up with Jacky and discovers that not only is Jacky secretly a woman, she is his future wife.

Decades later, after living out Ashbless&#x27;s entire life and becoming a widower, Doyle goes out to meet his historic date with death. Doyle discovers that his intended murderer is a duplicate of himself that the Master had made in Egypt decades before. Doyle kills the duplicate, thereby supplying the corpse for his death, and boats away into an unknown future.

==Reception==
&quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; was chosen for Gollancz&#x27;s Fantasy Masterworks (appearing as #47). Cheryl Morgan lists the novel among &quot;12 Classic Steampunk Books.&quot;

Chris Henderson reviews the book favorably in the December 1983 issue of &quot;Dragon Magazine&quot;. He calls it &quot;one of the best books to appear on the shelves this year&quot;. Noting it is &quot;one of those rare books—a solid mainstream fantasy novel&quot;, Henderson recommends it.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;Power&#x27;s manic, macabre imagination paints London as a lurid carnival of sinister gypsies, vicious clowns, beggar tyrants, werewolves, ghouls and eyeless things that scuttle in the sewers.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #80, and stated that &quot;Profound it isn&#x27;t but &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; offer terrific entertainment and much stealable scenario background for &quot;Call of Cockburn&quot; or whatever that game is called.&quot;

Algis Budrys declared that Powers &quot;supplies the one thing the reader has to have—and never more needfully than in a time-travel story. He supplies room for the reader to participate; to delve into each clearly delineated wonder, to turn it over in his or her own mind with full confidence that the author has honestly drawn the lineaments of the whole scene being presented. He invites the reader to interplay.&quot;

A 2006 review at SFReviews.net gives the novel 4.5 out of 5 stars and says, &quot;Tim Powers&#x27; masterpiece remains, over 20 years after its first publication, one of modern fantasy&#x27;s most dazzling acts of the imagination. There have been other novels in the genre about time travel, but none with &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot;&#x27; unique slant on the material, nor its bottomless well of inventiveness. It&#x27;s literally in a class by itself, a model for others to follow... Powers draws from everywhere: speculative quantum physics, ancient Egyptian mythology, Romany lore, history and classical literature. Then he mixes it all together with the carefree exuberance of a kid with his first chemistry set. The result, of course, blows up the room—but in the best possible way.&quot; A guardian.co.uk reviewer called it &quot;a torrential adventure which ranged from 19th-century poets to the gods of ancient Egypt... a thrilling, riproaring, wonderfully inventive adventure.&quot; Reviewer Steven Wu rated it 8 out of 10, saying that the book &quot;falls just short of being a truly great science-fiction novel.&quot; He wrote, &quot;The main virtue of the book is its unique and imaginative setting, a 19th-century London filled with deformed clowns, organized beggar societies, insane homunculi, and magic,&quot; but found the plot &quot;difficult to understand... especially in the completely baffling climactic sequence.&quot;

Reviewer Jonathan McCalmont praised the book&#x27;s tone: &quot;Despite a cast of grotesque supporting characters and more pulpy fantastical elements than you can shake a vorpal sword at, Powers manages to keep the tone of &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; darkly atmospheric... The more colourful aspects of the book are anchored in the real and serve only to make the setting more engaging and bizarre... Powers&#x27; Regency London never seems camp or farcical, it simply seems utterly alien and forbidding, even to a Londoner such as myself. Every page of this book drips with delicious weirdness. Despite being over 20 years old, it feels as fresh and as powerful as any contemporary fantasy novel you&#x27;re likely to find. It is Powers&#x27; talent for the strange that keeps you turning the pages—which is fortunate as the plotting is far from simple.&quot;

Reviewer Shaun Farrell wrote, &quot;With exotic characters and settings, including England of the late 1600s and sunny Egypt, &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot; is a time travel story that stacks up with the best of them and is sure to [stand] the test of time. It is pure imagination and fun, full of character driven action and humor. A novel that transcends genre limitations, this book will please lovers of all fiction alike.&quot;

==Recognition==
*Philip K. Dick Award winner, 1983;
*Locus Award nominee for Best Fantasy Novel, 1984;
*British Science Fiction Award nominee, 1985;
*SF Chronicle Award, 1984

==Stage adaptation==
The novel was adapted for the stage and directed by Ruth Pe Palileo, and the stage-play premiered on August 16, 2014, at the ExCel Exhibition Center in London, England.

The original cast featured Johnny Miles as Brendan Doyle, Ariana Helaine as Jacky Snapp, Timothy Cummings as J. Cochrane Darrow and Dr. Romany, Jake Taylor as Amenophis Fikee, Horrabin the Clown, and Lord Byron, and Geo Nikols as Steerforth Benner.

==In popular culture==
Javier Olivares has stated that the novel was one of the main inspirations for the Spanish television show &quot;El Ministerio del Tiempo&quot;, which he co-created.

Andy Lane has stated his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novel, &quot;All-Consuming Fire&quot;, was &quot;[his] attempt to emulate&quot; Powers&#x27; &quot;Anubis Gates&quot;.

The STV programming was relegated into overnight hours (before being dropped altogether) at the start of 1985, making way for the station to become an independent station under the callsign WIII. After financial trouble, channel 64 stabilized under ABRY Communications before being purchased by Sinclair in 1996. It was briefly an affiliate of UPN before switching to The WB in 1998 and becoming part of MyNetworkTV in 2006. WKRC-TV produces dedicated morning and late evening newscasts for air on WSTR-TV. The station is one of Cincinnati&#x27;s two ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) transmitters, serving the market&#x27;s major commercial stations, which each broadcast some of WSTR-TV&#x27;s subchannels on its behalf.

==History==
===Construction and subscription television years===
On June 30, 1977, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted a construction permit to Buford Television of Ohio, Inc., for a new channel 64 television station in Cincinnati, Ohio. WBTI signed on the air on January 28, 1980. It broadcast with one million watts of power and operated from studios on Fishwick Drive in the Bond Hill area; the station&#x27;s original transmitter was located on Chickasaw Street.

WBTI was conceived and began broadcasting as a hybrid. During the day, it was an advertiser-supported, general-entertainment independent station from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. each day, with a program schedule primarily consisting of classic reruns. In the late evening hours, the station&#x27;s signal was scrambled as it carried programming from the ON TV service, which provided movies, sports, and live events to viewers through a paid subscription and a decoder to receive ON TV programs. (Buford, which had planned a multi-city expansion into subscription television and even a national network of translators through its Residential Entertainment subsidiary, licensed the ON TV name from Oak Communications in the Cincinnati market and also would build STV operations in Chicago and Minneapolis under the brand name Spectrum; it created the Home Entertainment Network division for this business.) Local sports programming included a small package of Cincinnati Reds home games, a major advance for a team that had not permitted the telecast of more than three home games in a season on television since 1966.

WBTI&#x27;s ratings were less than stellar, while ON TV was being well received but already sensed that competition with cable was going to increase and present a difficulty in keeping subscribers. The subscription operation examined increasing to 20 hours a day—then the maximum amount of hours of non-free programming permitted by the FCC—as early as December 1981, and it carried out that expansion on April 1, 1982, relegating ad-supported WBTI programming to weekday mornings. In June 1983, the station cut back its commercial programs to the 90-minute edition of &quot;The 700 Club&quot; on weekdays, with ON TV the rest of the day and weekends except for three further hours of religious programs on Sunday mornings. It was able to do so because the FCC had abolished the so-called &quot;28-hour rule&quot;—which required stations to provide a minimum of, on average, four hours a day of non-subscription programming—in June 1982.

ON TV was beginning to face a tough road. After much delay, the Warner-Amex cable service QUBE became available within the Cincinnati city limits in early 1983, making ON TV less attractive to viewers. In October 1983, United Cable, which had acquired 80 percent of Buford&#x27;s three STV operations, wrote down the entire unit and offered the systems for sale. All of this programming was also seen in Dayton, where Buford established translator W66AQ in 1981 to extend the marketing area of ON TV and WBTI&#x27;s commercial fare.

===Emerging from STV===
United sold 90 percent of WBTI in November 1984 to Channel 64 Joint Venture for $9.4 million, at which time ON TV had just 12,500 local subscribers (75 percent of which subscribed to adult programming), compared to 45,200 in June 1982. The station relaunched as WIII, &quot;The Eyes of Cincinnati&quot;, on January 1, 1985; it restored a general-entertainment schedule, with ON TV programming being relegated to overnight hours only. At that time, general manager and Channel 64 Joint Venture part-owner Stephen Kent said the STV service &quot;virtually runs itself&quot; and could break even with just 2,600 customers. However, with a mere 3,200 subscribers remaining and Oak shutting down its satellite feed, ON TV in Cincinnati ended on June 1, 1985, at which time WIII converted into a full-time general-entertainment independent station.
Channel 64 soon ran into financial trouble. In April 1986, the station almost went off air after United Cable, which had retained a 10 percent stake after the 1984 sale to Channel 64 Joint Venture, sued the other partners, who refused to accept funding provided by the company to keep the station going. In a proceeding that saw the appointment of general manager Stephen A. Kent as receiver, it was revealed that the station owed more than $175,000 to program suppliers and had less than $5,000 in the bank. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing soon followed; the lengthy battle, marked by conflicts between United and the other partners, as well as cable penetration in the market, hurt the station, which had to exit several programming contracts. Talks with several potential buyers, including the Home Shopping Network, continued; Gerald J. Robinson, owner of the Cincinnati Gardens arena, made an offer, but it was ultimately United Cable that won out, immediately reselling the station to a consortium that included itself and two other investors.

Under United, the station left behind its status as what &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; media columnist John Kiesewetter called &quot;the IOUs of Cincinnati&quot; and began to spend again on syndicated programming. However, the other investors opted not to buy the remainder of WIII from United Cable, resulting in the station—now with better ratings and reduced program costs—being put back on the market in August 1988.

United sold WIII to Cincinnati TV 64 Limited Partnership, under the ownership of Andrew Banks and Royce Yudkoff, in November 1989. Their initials served as the name for ABRY Communications. Soon after, stronger programming was added to include more recent sitcoms and better movies, and ABRY also invested in improved equipment. On September 15, 1990, coinciding with a total program lineup overhaul, the station changed its call sign to WSTR-TV and its on-air branding to &quot;Star 64&quot;. In 1991, the station increased its transmitter power from one to five million watts at a brand new tower and transmitter site in Cincinnati&#x27;s College Hill neighborhood. That tower would be known as the &quot;Star Tower&quot; and would eventually be home to several radio stations and other communications services.

===Network affiliation===

Under ABRY&#x27;s ownership, the station acquired additional syndicated programs; WSTR then became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network (UPN) on January 16, 1995. In 1996, Sinclair Communications (now Sinclair Broadcast Group) acquired WSTR-TV (for $22 million) and KSMO-TV in Kansas City, Missouri, after already having purchased the remainder of the company&#x27;s stations in 1993. In July 1997, Sinclair signed an affiliation deal with The WB, that resulted in a number of the company&#x27;s UPN affiliates and independent stations switching to the network, among them WSTR, which began broadcasting WB programming in January 1998. The former WB outlet—low-power WBQC-LP (channel 25), with its limited signal and cable carriage—joined UPN nine months later.

In January 2006, The WB and UPN announced their effective merger into The CW. This was followed by the creation of MyNetworkTV by the Fox Television Stations group, which owned many UPN affiliates passed over for The CW. While Cincinnati only had one full-power affiliate between the two networks, Sinclair signed an affiliation agreement first with MyNetworkTV, which included WSTR-TV, two months before reaching any pact with The CW. (By that time, WKRC-TV had agreed to launch a subchannel to carry The CW.) WSTR carried MyNetworkTV&#x27;s debut on September 5, 2006. In 2009, WSTR reintroduced its 1990s brand, dropping the &quot;My&quot; branding in favor of &quot;Star 64&quot;, while keeping the network&#x27;s logo color and style scheme.

Sinclair purchased WKRC-TV from Newport Television in 2012. To complete this acquisition, Sinclair assigned the WSTR-TV license to Deerfield Media, continuing to operate the station under a local marketing agreement that allows Sinclair to sell WSTR-TV&#x27;s advertising time and provide technical, promotion, and support services for WSTR-TV&#x27;s operation. The sale was completed on December 3, 2012.

==Programming==
===Newscasts===

In December 2003, WSTR began producing a local 10 p.m. newscast with a staff of 19, using Sinclair&#x27;s News Central hybrid format with a local anchor—Kim Moening, previously of WXIX-TV—reading stories in Cincinnati and national segments produced from Sinclair&#x27;s headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

News Central was wound down nationally in early 2006, with the last newscast airing on February 24, 2006. It was replaced by a news share agreement with WKRC-TV, which began to produce a dedicated 10 p.m. newscast for the station in August 2006. After two years, WKRC-TV opted to reclaim the newscast for its CW subchannel.

Local news from WKRC-TV was restored in January 2014 after the two stations came under common operation, including a 10 p.m. newscast and a 7 a.m. hour of that station&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning Cincinnati&quot;. An 8 a.m. hour of the morning show was added in 2015.

===Sports programming===
From 2016 to 2022, WSTR was the television home of FC Cincinnati, airing all matches not chosen for national TV.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Cincinnati television stations:

WSTR-TV turned off its analog signal, over UHF channel 64, on February 17, 2009, the originally intended digital television transition date.

===ATSC 3.0===


On September 14, 2021, WSTR-TV turned off its ATSC 1.0 signal and became Cincinnati&#x27;s host station for ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV), with reciprocal agreements with the four other commercial stations in the market to continue ATSC 1.0 broadcast of its subchannels while broadcasting the other stations in 3.0 format.

<text>WKEF (channel 22) is a television station in Dayton, Ohio, United States, affiliated with ABC, Fox, and MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which provides certain services to Dabl affiliate WRGT-TV (channel 45) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Cunningham Broadcasting. However, Sinclair effectively owns WRGT-TV as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on Corporate Place in Miamisburg; WKEF&#x27;s transmitter is located off South Gettysburg Avenue in southwest Dayton.

==History==
===Early years===
Channel 22 first signed on in Dayton in October 1953 as WIFE (the call sign was to be WONE-TV, but was changed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February 1953). The station was owned by Skyland Broadcasting Corporation, then-owner of WONE (AM) radio. Although the station first carried programming from ABC and DuMont, the networks stopped providing programming and the station went dark on March 13, 1954. On February 19, 1959, the FCC changed the call sign of the still-dark WIFE to the earlier-proposed WONE-TV.

In March 1961, the owners of Skyland Broadcasting Corporation sold the construction permit for dark WONE-TV, as well as on-the-air then-sister stations WONE (AM) and WIFE (FM) (now WTUE), to Brush-Moore Newspapers.

From 1961 into 1963, WONE-TV (and other applicants) requested that the FCC assign a new channel 11 to Dayton; in WONE-TV&#x27;s case, the plan was to move its license from channel 22 to channel 11. Objecting to this request were other stations in the region already broadcasting on channel 11—WTOL in Toledo, WHAS-TV in Louisville and WIIC (now WPXI) in Pittsburgh—as well as channel 12, WKRC-TV in Cincinnati; the stations claimed that interference from the proposed Dayton channel would disrupt reception for significant numbers of their stations&#x27; viewers. Although the FCC initially seemed in favor of adding VHF channels to existing television markets, it ultimately decided against most of them, including channel 11 for Dayton.

In December 1963, Brush-Moore Newspapers sold the construction permit for still-dark WONE-TV to Springfield Television Corporation (owner of WWLP in Springfield, Massachusetts). In January 1964 the station was renamed WKEF after the maiden name, Kathryn Elizabeth Flynn, of Springfield Television Corporation owner William Lowell Putnam III&#x27;s future wife (who also went by the names Kitty Broman and Kitty Broman Putnam).

Sometime prior to February 18, 1963, Springfield Television asked that the FCC move channel 38 from Connersville, Indiana, to Dayton in lieu of the dark channel 22. Conventional wisdom suggested that WKEF would take the ABC affiliation since it was Dayton&#x27;s third commercial station. The actual initial sign-on for WKEF has been disputed: one unknown source stated that the station opened on August 22, 1964, while according to the Putnams&#x27; memoir, &quot;How We Survived in UHF Television&quot;, WKEF signed on in spring 1963.

Before 1964, ABC programming came to Dayton by way of off-hours clearances on NBC affiliate WLWD (channel 2, now WDTN). In addition, viewers could watch the full ABC schedule on WKRC-TV in Cincinnati and WTVN-TV (now WSYX) in Columbus, both of which decently covered Dayton. Under these circumstances, ABC initially balked at giving even a secondary affiliation to WKEF, forcing the station to make a go of it as an independent until late 1965. Another consideration may have been that many Dayton viewers did not have UHF-capable sets at the time. The FCC had just required television set manufacturers to include all-channel tuning months earlier.

In late 1965, ABC relented and gave WKEF the ABC affiliation, running ABC prime time shows and sports, plus any daytime shows that WKRC-TV or WTVN-TV preempted or WLWD (until 1971) did not carry. (From 1967 to 1971, independent station WKTR-TV channel 16 carried some ABC programs not cleared locally by WKEF.)

For many years, WKEF produced the daily children&#x27;s program &quot;Clubhouse 22&quot; hosted by Malcolm MacLeod in the early 1970s with Joe Smith taking over in the mid-1970s. Their cohorts included Duffy the Dog, Stan The Man, and later Dr. Creep (Barry Hobart). For a time, the theme song of the program was to the tune of &quot;High Hopes&quot; and included the lyrics &quot;Joe and Duff on Clubhouse 22!&quot; Later, the theme was to the tune of &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà,&quot; with the lyrics &quot;It&#x27;s time for Malcolm / And Duffy, too.&quot; Dr. Creep was also the host of WKEF&#x27;s weekly horror movie show, &quot;Shock Theater&quot;. Nationally syndicated conservative talk-show host Mike Gallagher began his broadcasting career at WKEF as a weatherman, sportscaster, and special events host.

By 1978, ABC had become the nation&#x27;s most-watched network (with shows such as &quot;Happy Days&quot;) and was unhappy with the Cincinnati–Dayton arrangement. WKRC-TV and WTVN-TV were both preempting decent amounts of the network&#x27;s daytime programming, late night shows, and some of the Saturday morning cartoons. ABC wanted a station in Dayton that could run its whole schedule and be able to reach Cincinnati and Columbus. It also wanted a station that had local news. Although the station did eventually launch a full-scale news department in 1979, it was not enough to save its affiliation with ABC.

===Switch to NBC===
In late 1979, ABC began talks with WDTN, which provided at least grade B coverage from northern Kentucky all the way to Columbus. The two sides quickly reached a deal, which called for ABC to move its Dayton affiliation to WDTN when WKEF&#x27;s contract ran out at the end of the year. The change took effect on New Year&#x27;s Day 1980. Almost by default, WKEF was then left to take the NBC affiliation. At the time, NBC was far less tolerant of preemptions than the other two commercial networks, and was also in last place among the three networks. As a condition of signing up with NBC, WKEF was required to clear NBC&#x27;s entire schedule.

Even with the affiliation swap, it remained in the ratings basement. NBC also lost market share in the Dayton–Springfield area to stronger affiliates in Cincinnati (WLWT, which has a city-grade signal in Dayton and a Grade B signal as far north as Piqua) and Columbus (WCMH-TV, which has a Grade B signal in Springfield and as far north as Bellefontaine). Since WKEF already had to compete in its own market with WDTN and CBS affiliate WHIO-TV—two of their networks&#x27; strongest performers—it found the going rather difficult.

In 1984, the Springfield Television group (WKEF, WWLP, and KSTU in Salt Lake City) was sold to Adams Communications. That company broke up the group in the late 1980s selling WKEF to KT Communications in 1989. KT invested millions in new equipment, updated the on-air look, and hired almost a completely new staff. However, it was not enough to get WKEF out of last place. Even with NBC&#x27;s powerhouse prime time lineup in the 1980s and early 1990s, it was the third station in what was basically a two-station market.

KT sold WKEF to Max Television (later Max Media Properties) in 1995. Ratings improved, but WKEF remained a distant third. In 1998, Max sold WKEF to Sinclair in a group deal. Later that year, Sinclair bought out Sullivan Broadcasting, owners of WRGT-TV in Dayton, and the licensee assets were given to Glencairn, Ltd. In 2001, Sinclair bought most of Sullivan&#x27;s stations, but could not buy WRGT-TV because the FCC does not allow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a market. Also, the Dayton market has only six full-power commercial stations—too few to legally permit a duopoly in any event. Accordingly, WRGT-TV was sold to Glencairn, Ltd. However, this was a sale in name only, as Glencairn&#x27;s stock was almost entirely owned by the Smith family, founders of Sinclair. This effectively gave Sinclair a duopoly in Dayton. Glencairn, now known as Cunningham Broadcasting, still owns WRGT-TV today as one of several arrangements that has led to allegations of Cunningham being merely a shell corporation for Sinclair. Sinclair has a similar arrangement in Columbus with ABC affiliate WSYX and Fox affiliate WTTE.

===Return to ABC===
In early 2004, WDTN became involved in an affiliation deal between NBC and LIN TV (the station&#x27;s owner at the time); that station took the opportunity to sign up with the more popular network, dropping ABC to switch back to NBC. In response to that deal, Sinclair signed an affiliation agreement with ABC which renewed the network&#x27;s affiliation agreement with its existing affiliates and caused WKEF and the intellectual unit of WICS and WICD in Springfield and Decatur, Illinois to become ABC affiliates. WKEF rejoined ABC on August 30, 2004 (thus reversing the 1980 swap), and since then has run the entire ABC schedule. Only a few months after returning to ABC, the station and all other Sinclair-owned ABC affiliates (including sister WSYX in Columbus) as well as two other ABC affiliates in Ohio preempted the movie &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. That decision was made due to the network&#x27;s plan to air the R-rated film unedited, potentially exposing its affiliated stations to FCC scrutiny if viewers complained about the film&#x27;s graphic violence and coarse language even though some of Sinclair&#x27;s stations had already shown the film unedited and uncensored a few months earlier. The incident landed Sinclair at the center of a mild controversy fueling the debate over whether the context of such material should be considered in determining broadcast indecency violations.

Around November 11, 2010, Sinclair announced that when carriage agreements expired at the end of the year, it planned to pull all of its owned and/or operated TV stations in the United States, including WKEF and WRGT-TV, from Time Warner Cable, in a dispute over &quot;retransmission fees&quot;. Negotiations began between the two parties. On December 31, Time Warner reached an agreement with an out-of-market station, presumably Cincinnati&#x27;s WCPO-TV, to provide ABC network programming at least through the end of February. Later that same day, Sinclair and Time Warner extended talks for another two weeks, with continued cable carriage of Sinclair&#x27;s stations, through January 14, 2011.
On January 15, 2011, after a 24-hour extension of the previous deadline, Time Warner and Sinclair reached a tentative settlement.
After further negotiations, a final agreement was reached on February 2, 2011, keeping WKEF and WRGT-TV on Time Warner.

On February 21, 2012, the Miamisburg City Council approved a $150,000 loan to Sinclair, which planned to move the WKEF/WRGT-TV studios from Soldiers Home-West Carrollton Road in Dayton, and to move their business and sales offices from Broadcast Plaza (the former WRGT-TV studios), consolidating all within the former studios of CW affiliate WBDT on Corporate Place, off Byers Road, in Miamisburg. Sinclair expected to spend $5 million on renovations to its new facility, making it fully digital and high definition. The stations had anticipated moving into their new studios in November 2012; the move was finalized on January 27, 2013, with high definition newscasts, updated graphics and new logos on both stations.

In June 2024, it was reported that Sinclair was doing major construction on the 3rd floor of the building that houses sister stations WKRC-TV and LMA sister WSTR-TV, leading to speculation that Sinclair was getting ready to move WKEF and WRGT-TV into its Cincinnati studios. With Cincinnati and Dayton less than a drive apart, it is not known if Sinclair is simply taking advantage of the FCC repealing the Main Studio Rule in 2019 or if there are plans to collapse the Cincinnati and Dayton markets into one large market; in the case of the latter, Sinclair would have a legal duopoly between WKEF and WKRC-TV while having operational control of WRGT-TV and WSTR-TV. (Sinclair would likely be allowed to continue operating the latter two stations under a grandfather clause since the markets would formally be separate; only Sinclair and E. W. Scripps Company, owners of Ion Media station WKOI-TV in Richmond, Indiana and company flagship WCPO-TV, currently own stations in both markets.) The speculation came after WKEF&#x27;s news director, Becky Gulden, took a job as the public information officer at West Clermont Local School District without a successor being named; however, a successor was named in September.

==News operation==
During the station&#x27;s early years, channel 22 had no local newscasts. WKEF established a news department in mid-1972 in response to licensing requirements with two weeknight broadcasts titled &quot;Eyewitness News&quot;. Mark Pierce was named news director, with anchor John Getter, sports from Billy McCool, and meteorologist Virginia Bigler. Bigler was granted the American Meteorological Society Seal of Approval based on her weather segments, becoming the second female meteorologist in the United States to receive this. The news department was discontinued after the Xenia tornado in 1974. The final &quot;Eyewitness News at 11&quot; was anchored by Paul Douglas (Wilson) who had joined the WKEF staff as an anchor, reporter, and producer in 1973.

From 1974 to 1979, WKEF decided against airing its own newscasts possibly owing to low ratings. It relied instead on brief audio-only news updates from newscasters from local radio station WING. It ran these updates at selected times in the morning, afternoon, and evening using a still slide on-screen with a picture of the newscaster. WKEF brought back full news programs in 1979 under the moniker &quot;22 Alive! News&quot; with anchors Tom Miller and Jack Marschall.

In 1998, sister station WRGT-TV began airing a nightly 10 p.m. newscast, now known as &quot;Fox 45 News at 10&quot;, using WKEF&#x27;s news team.

On June 12, 2006, WKEF began airing a weekday morning program from 5 to 7 a.m., called &quot;ABC 22 Good Morning&quot;. On the same day, WRGT-TV began airing &quot;FOX 45 in the Morning&quot; from 7 to 9 a.m. weekdays.

In August 2008, &quot;Fox 45 Dayton&#x27;s News Source at 6:30&quot; was added to WRGT-TV, airing on weeknights against the national news broadcasts on the &quot;Big Three&quot; stations.

In terms of ratings, WKEF&#x27;s newscasts have always been a distant third place behind WHIO and WDTN. However, on some nights (usually Sundays because of ABC programming) there are times that WKEF is runner-up to WHIO. WKEF did not participate in the wider implementation of Sinclair&#x27;s now-defunct, controversial &quot;News Central&quot; format for its newscasts but did air &quot;The Point&quot;, a one-minute conservative political commentary hosted by Mark E. Hyman, that was also controversial and a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations with newscasts until the series was discontinued in December 2006.

As of July 21, 2012, with WDTN&#x27;s upgrade to high definition local newscasts, WKEF and WRGT-TV remained the only two &quot;Big Four&quot; network-affiliated television stations in the Dayton area that continued to broadcast their newscasts in pillarboxed 4:3 standard definition. WHIO-TV was the first to have made the upgrade to full high definition. Dean Ditmer, general manager of the stations, announced that WKEF and WRGT-TV would upgrade to HD in 2012 with a new set; the existing set had been in use since January 1995. On October 29, 2012, the stations began constructing their new set at their future Corporate Place studios. HD newscasts from the new studios began on January 27, 2013.

In August 2015, the station began branding its newscasts as &quot;Fox 45 News on ABC&quot;, using its sister station&#x27;s branding. In September 2018, the station returned to using &quot;ABC 22 News&quot;.

The station made national headlines on May 28, 2019, when a video surfaced of the station&#x27;s news department cutting into the previous night&#x27;s airing of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; for a breaking news story on a tornado warning in the area, and meteorologist Jamie Simpson firing back at social media complaints about the preemption by stating that saving people&#x27;s lives was more important than an episode of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;. Simpson later apologized for his rant but said he did not regret the station preempting the series in favor of safety; &quot;Bachelorette&quot; contestant Hannah Brown sided with Simpson. Some viewers also sided with Simpson and said that they appreciated &quot;putting those complaining in their place&quot;. As tornadoes did indeed hit the Dayton area later that night, The Weather Channel cited Simpson&#x27;s rant as &quot;possibly saving lives&quot;.

On July 9, 2019, the station rebranded its news operation as &quot;Dayton 24/7 Now&quot;, sharing that brand with WRGT-TV. It introduced streaming apps and a social media presence with the same name and redirected its former website, www.abc22now.com. In addition, it tweaked its graphics to a different variation used by Sinclair stations.

In September 2024, chief anchor Adam Aaro was named news director of &quot;Dayton 24/7 Now&quot;. In early November 2024, the weeknight 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts on WKEF, as well as the weeknight 6:30 and 10 p.m. newscasts on Fox 45, were changed to an anchorless format, similar to the so-called &quot;Scrippscast&quot; format used by some E. W. Scripps Company television stations; Aaro no longer appears on-air, instead providing the voiceover for some news stories. These newscasts include a meteorologist, sometimes live, sometimes pre-recorded, while reporters introduce their stories themselves. All other newscasts on the stations have a traditional format, using live anchors and meteorologists.

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WKEF aired The Tube on DT2 and Time Warner Cable digital channel 723. WKEF and other Sinclair stations dropped The Tube on December 31, 2006. In October 2010, WKEF began airing TheCoolTV on 22.2. On April 12, 2011, Time Warner Cable began airing TheCoolTV on digital channel 996. Sinclair dropped TheCoolTV from all its stations, including WKEF, on August 31, 2012. Starting June 30, 2014, WKEF began airing GetTV on its second digital subchannel. On January 1, 2015, WKEF began airing Grit on its third digital subchannel. On January 1, 2016, the Antenna TV network was scheduled to be added on the third digital subchannel. Instead the third digital subchannel was changed to Antenna TV on December 4, 2015, while Grit was moved to a new fourth digital subchannel. On February 15, 2016, GetTV was dropped from 22.2 and replaced by Sinclair&#x27;s American Sports Network. On February 28, 2017, Grit was dropped from DT4 and replaced by Sinclair&#x27;s TBD. Around March 9, 2017, after and seemingly due to numerous viewer complaints, TBD was dropped from DT4 and Grit was restored. It was later revealed that Grit had been restored because WKEF had not provided Grit the mandatory 90-day notice that it was being dropped. On June 15, 2017, TBD was restored to 22.4. On September 6, 2017, American Sports Network merged into Sinclair&#x27;s jointly-owned Stadium, with 22.2 changing accordingly.

On December 29, 2020, the station announced that on January 1, 2021, the main subchannel of sister station WRGT-TV, a Fox affiliate branded as &quot;Fox 45&quot;, would be moving to 22.2. In addition, Stadium and TBD would be moving from WKEF to subchannels of WRGT-TV. The station advised over-the-air viewers to rescan on that date. The &quot;Fox 45&quot; branding remained on 22.2, with the logo similar to that previously used by WRGT-TV, except that callsign was replaced by &quot;WKEF(TV) 22.2&quot;. The former home of TBD, 22.4, was dropped.

On April 19, 2021, Antenna TV moved from 22.3 to 45.3 on sister station WRGT-TV. MyNetworkTV in prime time moved to 22.3 from 45.1, while Stadium outside of prime time also moved to 22.3, from 45.5, returning to WKEF.

On October 30, 2023, Sinclair replaced Stadium with its new network The Nest; as was done with Stadium, The Nest airs outside of prime time while MyNetworkTV continues to air in prime time on 22.3.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WKEF ended regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 22, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 51, using virtual channel 22.

As part of the SAFER Act, WKEF kept its analog signal on the air until June 26 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

After that, analog transmissions on channel 22 continued, except now at low power, rebroadcasting WRGT-DT2&#x27;s MyNetworkTV and This TV programming. Initially, this new low-power analog broadcast operated under Cincinnati sister station WSTR-TV&#x27;s Dayton translator license, W66AQ (formerly on channel 66). On June 30, 2010, W66AQ&#x27;s callsign was changed to W22DE. On December 8, 2010, Cincinnati&#x27;s WCPO-TV moved its digital operations to channel 22. (According to RabbitEars, this knocked W22DE off the air; however, W22DE filed for a license renewal with the FCC on June 3, 2013.) The W22DE license was canceled by Sinclair on May 28, 2021.

In a petition published by the FCC on September 18, 2014, WKEF requested moving the station&#x27;s digital signal from channel 51 to channel 18. This request was made as part of WKEF&#x27;s agreement with T-Mobile to eliminate potential interference with that company&#x27;s wireless operations adjacent to channel 51. The move to channel 18 was completed on July 16, 2015.

WKEF moved its digital signal from channel 18 to channel 34 at 10 a.m. on October 18, 2019, as part of the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation process. The station&#x27;s transmitter power was reduced from 525 kW to 47.86 kW, pending a construction permit with the FCC to increase power to 950 kW. New antennas for both WKEF and WRGT-TV were installed via helicopter prior to December 23, 2019 and were connected to interim auxiliary transmitters on January 24, 2020; the station predicted that the transmitter work would be completed soon after.

<text>WRGT-TV (channel 45) is a television station in Dayton, Ohio, United States, affiliated with the digital multicast network Dabl. It is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting, which maintains a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of ABC/Fox/MyNetworkTV affiliate WKEF (channel 22), for the provision of certain services. However, Sinclair effectively owns WRGT-TV as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on Corporate Place in Miamisburg; WRGT-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located off South Gettysburg Avenue in southwest Dayton.

WRGT-TV was a charter Fox affiliate from the network&#x27;s sign-on in 1986 until 2021.

==History==
WRGT-TV signed on as an independent station on September 23, 1984, owned by Meridian Communications, based in Pittsburgh. WRGT-TV was Meridian&#x27;s second station; it had launched WVAH-TV in Charleston, West Virginia, two years earlier. Meridian founded WRGT-TV following a high-stakes &quot;in-contest&quot; competition among four potential owners in the late 1970s. The station ran a general-entertainment format consisting of cartoons, classic sitcoms, recent off-network sitcoms, old movies, drama shows, and sports. On its sign on date, WRGT-TV broadcast &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, with a stereo simulcast of the audio over WTUE-FM 104.7. It originally used the slogan &quot;Off To a Flying Start&quot;, featuring an animated Wright &quot;B&quot; Flyer used in its first promos (the &quot;WRGT&quot; calls are a reference to the Wright brothers).

Prior to its sign on, the only source of non-network programming in Dayton was WTJC (channel 26, now WBDT) a mostly religious station. However, WXIX-TV and WIII-TV (now WSTR-TV), both in Cincinnati, and WTTE in Columbus all reached portions of the Dayton market, and WTTV in Indianapolis was available on cable. Meridian persuaded WTJC&#x27;s owner, Miami Valley Christian Television, to sell most of that station&#x27;s non-religious programming to WRGT-TV. For all intents and purposes, it was now the only general-entertainment station in Dayton and the first independent since the demise of WKTR-TV in 1970 (now public station WPTD) and WSWO-TV in Springfield in 1972 (which used the same channel 26 allocation as WTJC/WBDT).

Despite the competition from larger-market stations and with WXIX, WSTR and WTTV being available on cable, WRGT-TV prospered. It would not have any real competition in Dayton until 1999 when WBDT became a primary WB affiliate (it was a brief O&amp;O of the Pax TV network before then). After Fox launched on October 6, 1986, WRGT-TV became a charter affiliate of the fledgling network. On October 30, 1987, Meridian sold the station to Act III Broadcasting. Act III merged with Abry Broadcast Partners in 1995; the group would be renamed Sullivan Broadcasting, after Dan Sullivan was named as the company&#x27;s its president and CEO.

In 1998, after Sullivan was bought out by Sinclair, Sinclair filed to sell all license assets of the station, alongside WVAH-TV to Glencairn, Ltd. Around the same time, Sinclair had also bought WKEF (then an NBC affiliate). In 2001, Sinclair purchased most of Sullivan&#x27;s other stations, but could not buy WRGT-TV for two reasons. The Dayton market has only seven full-power stations, not enough to legally permit a duopoly. Also, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) does not allow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market. However, nearly all of Glencairn&#x27;s stock was controlled by trusts in the name of the Smith family who were founding owners of Sinclair. This effectively gave Sinclair a duopoly in Dayton. Glencairn later changed its name to Cunningham Broadcasting. There is undeniable evidence that Glencairn/Cunningham are merely shell corporations used to circumvent FCC ownership rules.

Until the early 2021 move of the Fox 45 programming to a subchannel of sister station WKEF, WRGT-TV was also considered an alternate ABC affiliate, airing that network&#x27;s programs when WKEF was unable to do so such as during a breaking news emergency or local special. Until that move, WRGT-TV, along with CBS affiliate WHIO-TV (channel 7), were the only two stations in the area who had not changed their network affiliations even through the swaps of 2004.

In August 2006, it was confirmed that Fox&#x27;s new sister network, MyNetworkTV, would air on a new second digital subchannel of WRGT-TV. On September 16, 2006, Time Warner Cable added MyTV Dayton to its digital cable lineup. In November 2008, the subchannel additionally became a launch-day affiliate of This TV, while retaining MyNetworkTV in prime time.

Around November 11, 2010, Sinclair announced that when carriage agreements expired at the end of the year, it planned to pull all of its owned and/or operated TV stations in the United States, including WRGT-TV and WKEF, from Time Warner Cable, in a dispute over &quot;retransmission fees&quot;. Negotiations began between the two parties. Around December 6, Time Warner announced that it would continue to provide Fox network programming on its systems (presumably via video on demand services), under a deal reached with Fox earlier in 2010; syndicated and local programs on Sinclair&#x27;s Fox affiliates would not be seen. On December 31, Time Warner reached an agreement with an out-of-market station, presumably Cincinnati&#x27;s WXIX-TV, to provide Fox network programming at least through the end of February. Later that same day, Sinclair and Time Warner extended talks for another two weeks, with continued cable carriage of Sinclair&#x27;s stations, through January 14, 2011.
On January 15, 2011, after a 24-hour extension of the previous deadline, Time Warner and Sinclair reached a tentative settlement.
After further negotiations, a final agreement was reached on February 2, 2011, keeping WRGT-TV and WKEF on Time Warner.

On February 21, 2012, Miamisburg City Council approved a $150,000 loan to Sinclair, which planned to move the WRGT-TV/WKEF studios from Soldiers Home-West Carrollton Road in Dayton, and to move their business and sales offices from Broadcast Plaza (the former WRGT-TV studios), consolidating all within the former studios of CW affiliate WBDT on Corporate Place, off Byers Road, in Miamisburg. Sinclair expected to spend $5 million on renovations to its new facility, making it fully digital and high definition. The stations had anticipated moving into their new studios in November 2012; the move was finalized on January 27, 2013, with high definition newscasts, updated graphics and new logos on both stations.

On May 15, 2012, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network&#x27;s affiliation agreement with Sinclair&#x27;s 19 Fox stations, including WRGT-TV, allowing them to continue carrying Fox programming through 2017.

On the network&#x27;s October 31, 2015 launch, WRGT-TV added the Sinclair-owned Comet on its third digital subchannel, 45.3.

On February 28, 2017, WRGT-TV added the Sinclair-owned Charge! on its fourth digital subchannel, 45.4. Charge! programming is only available over-the-air and has never been provided by local cable operators.

On October 8, 2019, the station replaced This TV programming on subchannel 45.2 with programming from Dabl, while retaining MyNetworkTV in prime time.

On December 29, 2020, the station announced that on January 1, 2021, its main subchannel would be moving to 22.2 on sister station WKEF. This was the result of Sinclair renewing several Fox affiliations, including that for Dayton, but instead of stations owned by their sidecar companies, the affiliations would shift to directly owned Sinclair stations. A similar move of the Fox affiliation from Port Arthur, Texas-licensed KBTV-TV, which it operates, to a subchannel of Sinclair-owned KFDM, licensed to Beaumont, Texas occurred, as station management there explained that the Fox schedule would air on both channels in a transition period ending on February 1. In addition, TBD and Stadium would be moving from WKEF to new WRGT-TV subchannels 45.5 and 45.6. The station advised over-the-air viewers to rescan on January 1. The 22.1/45.1 simulcast ended on February 4, with Fox becoming exclusive to 22.2.

That day, WRGT-DT1&#x27;s programming was replaced with the MyNetworkTV/Dabl schedule formerly on 45.2, with TBD moving to 45.5 to 45.2 and the 45.6 Stadium subchannel going dark, as it moved to 45.5. On April 19, 2021, MyNetworkTV and Stadium programming then moved from 45.1 to 22.3, with Comet shifting to that position, and Antenna TV shifting from 22.3 to 45.3; since then, WRGT&#x27;s main channel has exclusively carried Dabl.

==Newscasts==
As a Fox affiliate, WRGT-TV broadcast hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday and 30 minutes each on Saturdays and Sundays).

In 1998, WRGT-TV started its nightly 10 o&#x27;clock newscast, now known as &quot;Fox 45 News at 10&quot;, using sister station WKEF&#x27;s existing news team. In the February 2006 sweeps period, the station&#x27;s 10 o&#x27;clock news was the fastest growing local broadcast in the Dayton market, on certain nights, sometimes winning the time slot. Until 2007, there was direct 10 o&#x27;clock news competition from WHIO-TV&#x27;s Time Warner Cable-only Miami Valley Channel. There was no over-the-air competition until August 18, 2007, when NBC affiliate WDTN began to produce a nightly 10 o&#x27;clock newscast on CW affiliate WBDT; this beat WRGT-TV&#x27;s show in Dayton&#x27;s metered market household ratings on the 26th day of its broadcast.

On June 12, 2006, WKEF began airing a weekday morning program from 5 to 7, called &quot;ABC 22 Good Morning&quot;. On the same day, WRGT-TV began airing &quot;Fox 45 in the Morning&quot; from 7 to 9 a.m. weekdays. In August 2008, WKEF began producing a 6:30 p.m. newscast for WRGT-TV, airing on weeknights against the national news broadcasts on the &quot;Big Three&quot; stations.

On July 9, 2019, the station rebranded its news operation as &quot;Dayton 24/7 Now&quot;, sharing that brand with WKEF. It introduced streaming apps and a social media presence with the same name and redirected its former website, www.fox45now.com. In addition, it tweaked its graphics to a different variation used by Sinclair stations.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Dayton television stations:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WRGT-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 45, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 30, using virtual channel 45.

WRGT-TV moved its digital signal from channel 30 to channel 36 at 10 a.m. on October 18, 2019, as part of the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation process. The station&#x27;s transmitter power was reduced from 498 kW to 44.16 kW, pending a construction permit with the FCC to increase power to 1,000 kW. New antennas for both WRGT-TV and WKEF were installed via helicopter prior to December 23, 2019, and were connected to interim auxiliary transmitters on January 24, 2020; the station predicted that the transmitter work would be completed soon after.

<text>Benjamin Franklin Thorne (June 16, 1930 – March 7, 2021) was an American comic book artist-writer, best known for the Marvel Comics character Red Sonja.

==Comics==
Thorne began his comics career in 1948, penciling romance comics for Standard Comics. After graduation, he drew the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; newspaper strip for King Features, which was followed by more comic book work for Dell Comics. He turned out a multitude of stories for &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, &quot;Jungle Jim&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, &quot;Tom Corbett Space Cadet&quot;, &quot;Tomahawk&quot;, &quot;Mighty Samson&quot;, &quot;Enemy Ace&quot; and numerous others. Thorne drew the syndicated comic strip &quot;Dr. Guy Bennett&quot; / &quot;Dr. Duncan&quot; from 1956 to 1963 for LaFave Newspaper Features.

Originally drawn by Barry Windsor-Smith for &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;, Red Sonja was transposed from a minor Robert E. Howard 16th-century gunslinger character (&quot;Red Sonya&quot;) to a mainstay of the sword and sorcery Conan canon by Roy Thomas. After the character was spun off into a solo feature, Thorne succeeded penciler Dick Giordano in drawing her for &quot;Marvel Feature&quot; #2 (Jan. 1976), continuing through most of her 1977-79 solo series, &quot;Red Sonja&quot;.

Thorne subsequently created a number of erotic fantasy comics and characters, alongside other works. His works include creating, writing and drawing the features &quot;Moonshine McJugs&quot; for &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Lann&quot; in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, and &quot;Danger Rangerette&quot; in &quot;National Lampoon&quot;, and the 1989 miniseries &quot;Ribit!&quot; for (), as well as the Fantagraphics Books/Eros Comix graphic novels &quot;Ghita of Alizarr&quot;, &quot;The Iron Devil&quot;, &quot;The Devil’s Angel&quot;, and &quot;The Illustrated History of Union County&quot;.

Publishing company Hermes Press has reprinted &quot;Lann&quot;, &quot;Ribit!&quot; and &quot;Ghita of Alizarr&quot;; the latter being reprinted as an archival, nearly full-sized reproduction of the original art.

=== Controversy ===
Prosecutors in the Planet Comics and Science Fiction Store obscenity case in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in 1995–1996 confiscated Thorne&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Angel&quot;, among other creators&#x27; works, as alleged child pornography.

== Other media ==
Thorne wrote and produced the documentary &quot;Two Lords and a Lady&quot;, about Elizabeth Lee “Aunt Betty” Frazee and The Battle of the Short Hills. He wrote the books &quot;The Barrington Hall Sketchbook&quot;, &quot;Drawing Sexy Women&quot;, &quot;The Crystal Ballroom&quot;, and &quot;The Alizarrian Trilogy: Nymph&quot;, all published by Fantagraphics Books., also &quot;Frank Thorne&#x27;s Battling Beauties&quot; (with Howard Leroy Davis as co-writer and which includes &quot;Sylph&quot; from &quot;The Alizarrian Trilogy&quot;), &quot;Frank Thorne&#x27;s Ribit&quot;, &quot;Frank Thornre&#x27;s Lann&quot;, all published by Hermes Press. His work as a writer-illustrator has appeared in &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Hustler&quot;, &quot;Golden Magazine&quot;, &quot;High Times&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

== Awards ==
Thorne&#x27;s awards include a 1963 National Cartoonists Society award in the Comic Book Division, the 1978 San Diego Inkpot Award, the Playboy editorial award for best comic for Moonshine McJugs, Warren Magazine&#x27;s Best Comic for Ghita of Alizarr, NJ Art Director’s Club.

== Personal life ==
Thorne was known during the 1970s for attending comic book conventions in his persona as The Wizard judging Red Sonja Lookalike Contests. He was born in Rahway, New Jersey, and as of 2010 lived in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

Thorne wanted to be known as a master in all aspects of cartooning and illustration. This lifetime pursuit was completed with his humorous &quot;Moonshine McJuggs&quot; cartoons published in &quot;Playboy&quot;. He acknowledged that he could not have done all that he had done without the support of Marilyn, his wife of sixty-nine years. Despite the controversial nature of some of his material her support was unwavering. This enabled Thorne to work in every area of cartooning and illustration from Sunday School pamphlets to pornography.

He and Marilyn died on the same day: March 7, 2021.

<text>Kobryn (; ; ; ) or Kobrin (), is a town in Brest Region, Belarus. It serves as the administrative center of Kobryn District. It is located in the southwestern corner of Belarus, where the Mukhavets river and Dnieper–Bug Canal meet. The town lies about east of the city of Brest. As of 2024, it has a population of 52,635.

== History ==
In the early times, it was inhabited by the ancient Baltic Yotvingian tribe. At various times, the city belonged to Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian Empire, the Second Polish Republic, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Republic of Belarus.

=== Middle Ages and early modern era ===

In the 10th century, the area became part of the emerging Polish state under first ruler Mieszko I of Poland. Later, the area was part of the Kievan Rus&#x27; and the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia. Kobryn was first mentioned in 1287. In the early 14th century the town formed part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after the Union of Krewo (1385) in the Polish–Lithuanian Union. It became the capital of a feudal principality within the Polish–Lithuanian realm, existing from 1387 to 1518. In 1500, princess Anna Kobryńska founded the Catholic church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. After 1518, Kobryn was ruled by Queen Bona Sforza, who contributed to its development and visited it several times.

A seat of a &quot;powiat&quot;, in between 1589 and 1766 it was a royal city of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, located on Magdeburg Law. This allowed for a large number of Jews to settle in the area following the 16th century. The Jewish population in 1900 was 6,738. In Kobryń was held the county Sejmik of the Mozyrz County during the Russian occupation of Mozyrz in 1659. In the years 1774–1784 a canal was built connecting the Mukhavets River with the Pina River, named the Royal Canal after Polish King Stanisław August Poniatowski, who opened it, and as a result a water route was created connecting the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea.

=== Late modern era ===

After the Partitions of Poland of 1795, the town was annexed by Imperial Russia. Catherine II gave Kobryn to Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov for his war merits, especially for the suppression of the Polish Kościuszko Uprising. At Kobrin the first significant Russian victory over the French occurred during the French invasion of Russia. After the unsuccessful January Uprising anti-Polish repressions intensified: estates were confiscated, insurgents and landowners were deported to Siberia (see: &quot;sybirak&quot;) and a ban on land acquisition by ethnic Poles was introduced. Kobryn was occupied by Germany during World War I.

Kobryń came under Polish control in February 1919, four months after the reestablishment of independent Poland. During the Polish–Soviet War it was the site of the victorious Battle of Kobryń in September 1920. Polish rule was confirmed under the terms of the Treaty of Riga in 1921 and Kobryń became a seat of a powiat within the Polesie Voivodeship. After the war, crafts, small industry and trade developed again, and small factories were established. In 1923, the State Gymnasium was founded, which three years later received the name of Maria Rodziewiczówna, a Polish writer living nearby, who co-financed the construction of the school.

=== World War II and recent times ===

During the 1939 Invasion of Poland, Kobryn was the battle scene of the Battle of Kobryń between the Polish 60th Infantry Division of Colonel Adam Epler and the German 19th Panzer Corps of General Heinz Guderian. After three days of fighting, the Poles withdrew southwards and the Germans entered the town, which they three days later handed over to the Soviets in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On 14 November 1939, Kobryn was incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR.

From 23 June 1941 until 20 July 1944, Kobryn was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of the Generalbezirk Wolhynien-Podolien of Reichskommissariat Ukraine. During the latter period, the majority of Jewish inhabitants were first amassed in a ghetto and then murdered by the Nazis in their extermination camps.

Two Polish priests, The Reverend Władysław Grobelny and Jan Wolski from Kobryń near Brześć, arrested for helping the Jews, were executed on October 15, 1942 together with a number of Jews from the Brześć ghetto.

In 1944, the town was captured by the Red Army. Since 1991, it is a part of the Republic of Belarus.

<doc id="628334" wikidata="Q123125135" url="?curid=628334" title="Adelaide University">
<text>Adelaide University is a planned public research university based in Adelaide, South Australia. Established in 2024, it will combine the University of Adelaide, the third-oldest university in Australia, and the University of South Australia (UniSA) which has an antecedent history dating back to 1856. It will be adjacent to the Australian Space Agency in Lot Fourteen, form part of the Adelaide BioMed City research precinct and will have a presence in the Adelaide Technology Park. It is expected to operate concurrently with the two neighbouring universities during a transition period with the merged university formally opening in January 2026.

The two antecedent universities&#x27; histories date back to the former Royal South Australian Society of Arts. The University of Adelaide was founded in 1874 by the Union College with studies initially conducted at its Institute Building. The society was also the birthplace of the South Australian Institute of Technology founded in 1889 as the School of Mines and Industries. The institute later became the University of South Australia during the Dawkins Revolution following a merger with amalgamated colleges dating back to the School of Art, also founded at the society. The two universities, which account for approximately three-quarters of the state&#x27;s public university population, agreed to merge as &quot;Adelaide University&quot; in mid-2023.

The university will inherit seven campuses including the combined flagship Adelaide City campus in North Terrace, a tech-oriented campus in Mawson Lakes, the Magill campus specialising in social sciences, the Waite campus in Urrbrae and three regional campuses in Roseworthy, Mount Gambier and Whyalla. Its academic activities are currently divided between the two universities, which had a combined revenue of A$1.85 billion in 2023. It will also manage several museums and exhibitions in a range of fields, including the Samstag Museum and Adelaide Planetarium. It has been invited to join the Group of Eight, an association of research-intensive universities in Australia, and will play roles in the Australian space and defence sectors.

Adelaide University alumni, which will include those of the two antecedent universities, include the first female prime minister of Australia, two presidents of Singapore, the first astronaut born in Australia and the first demonstrator of nuclear fusion. The two universities have also produced a combined 117 Rhodes scholars, 169 Fulbright scholars and three Nobel laureates. Its history involve the development of penicillin, space exploration, sunscreen, the military tank, Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes and X-ray crystallography, and the study of viticulture and oenology.

==History==
=== University of Adelaide ===
The history of the University of Adelaide dates back to the Union College established in 1872 to provide education to aspiring Protestant ministers who were previously required to travel to the United Kingdom. The college approached Scottish-born pastoralist Walter Watson Hughes with the proposal for a South Australian university with a request for endowment towards its creation. Following an agreement, a university association was established by the Union College on 23 September 1872 to manage the creation of the university.The University of Adelaide, which is named after its founding city namesake to Queen Adelaide, was formally established on 6 November 1874 following the passage of its founding legislation through the South Australian parliament. The parliament also provided a 2 hectare (5 acre) land grant for a campus. Its early benefactors, many of whom Scottish immigrants, made large donations to develop the university. The university has produced some of the Australia&#x27;s earliest businesspeople, lawyers, medical professionals and politicians.
It was founded with the backing of its first benefactor Walter Hughes and Thomas Elder, also a Scottish-born pastoralist and another founder of the university, who each donated £20,000 towards the association. The university initially occupied the South Australian Institute Building prior to the construction of the University Building which housed the entire campus at the time. Elder also bequeathed an additional £65,000 in his will following his death in 1897 of which £20,000 were allocated to set up the Elder Conservatorium of Music. Other donors include William Mitchell and Robert Barr Smith, also from Scotland and early leaders of the university.
The institution was the third of its kind on the Australian continent after the Universities of Sydney and Melbourne, which then educated solely men. The university, which allowed women to study alongside men since its commencement soon became the second university in the English-speaking world following the University of London in 1878 to formally admit women on equal terms as men in 1881. This was following a royal charter granted by Queen Victoria that year, which allowed for women to be conferred degrees. This has contributed to a number of firsts in the history of women&#x27;s education in Australia.

Notable women include its first female graduate Edith Emily Dornwell who concurrently became the first person in Australia to receive the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1885. The university also graduated Australia&#x27;s first female surgeon Laura Margaret Fowler in 1891. Ruby Claudia Davy was the first Australian woman to receive a doctorate in music in 1918. Other notable firsts also include Winifred Kiek, Margaret Reid and Janine Haines. In 1914, the university was also the first to elect a woman, Helen Mayo, to a university council in Australia. It is also the alma mater of Roma Mitchell who was Australia&#x27;s first female judge, the first woman to be a Queen&#x27;s Counsel, a chancellor of an Australian university and the governor of an Australian state. Australia&#x27;s first female prime minister Julia Gillard had also studied at the university and the first Aboriginal Rhodes Scholar Rebecca Richards in 2010.

In 1991, it formally opened two additional campuses in Greater Adelaide outside of the city centre. These included the Waite and Roseworthy campuses, though the university operated at the Waite site since at least 1924 as the Waite Agricultural Research Institute. The Roseworthy campus was the former Roseworthy Agricultural College which, although affiliated with the university since 1905, was an independent institution prior to their merger. Additionally, the university previously operated research facilities across in Thebarton approximately north of the campus until 2020.

=== University of South Australia ===
The SA School of Art, the earliest antecedent institution of the University of South Australia, was established in 1856 at the former Royal South Australian Society of Arts. The independent art school, which went through many name changes, resided for most of its history at the Jubilee Exhibition Building which was later transferred to the University of Adelaide in 1929. It remained on the campus until 1962 when the building was demolished to make way for several university buildings.

The Jubilee Exhibition Building was also the birthplace of the South Australian Institute of Technology which was established in 1889 as the SA School of Mines and Industries. It moved to the neighbouring Brookman Building in 1903, named after the Scottish-born businessman George Brookman who contributed £15,000 towards its construction. The institute maintained strong ties with the neighbouring University of Adelaide that included the co-ordination of teaching, laboratories and examinations across fields of engineering and sciences. Despite the university later establishing its own faculty of engineering in 1937, the reciprocal relationship remained intertwined to the University Council and studies completed at the institute were recognised as equivalent studies eligible for credit towards university courses. The institute later expanded to the regional city of Whyalla in 1962 and to the Adelaide suburb of Mawson Lakes in 1972 as &quot;The Levels&quot;. In 1965, it was designated an advanced college which initiated an expansion in the variety of courses available.

The Adelaide Teachers College, which changed names and shifted locations multiple times throughout its existence, was established in 1876. Despite not being located at the University of Adelaide campus until 1900, students from the institution attended university lectures since at least 1878. In 1921, it renamed to the Adelaide Teachers College, in line with other interstate teachers colleges. Despite offers from the university to take control of the college, which was heavily integrated into the university, the Education Department retained administrative authority throughout its early history. The Hartley Building was built as its permanent home in 1927.

The college eventually renamed to the Adelaide College of the Arts and Education. It also established additional teachers colleges in other parts of the city including Magill. Following a series of mergers, the colleges expanded to become advanced colleges which all later amalgamated with the original mother college to become the South Australian College of Advanced Education in 1982. The combined institution continued its presence alongside the University of Adelaide with which it maintained joint teaching, facilities and committees. The campus merged with the university in 1991.

Stronger demand for advanced college places throughout the country resulted from a broadening appeal of higher education beyond the traditionally elite education provided by the universities. Advanced colleges were originally designed to complement universities, forming a binary system modelled on that of the United Kingdom. It was originally created by the Menzies government following World War II on the advice of a committee led by physicist Leslie H. Martin, during a period of high population growth and corresponding demand for secondary and tertiary education. This sector ceased to exist when, between 1989 and 1992, the Hawke-Keating government implemented the sweeping reforms of Education Minister John Dawkins that dismantled the binary system. The states, eager for increased education funding, merged the colleges either with existing universities or with each other to form new universities. Following its expansion and increasing autonomy from the university, the South Australian Institute of Technology was given the option to merge with either TAFE South Australia or the South Australian College of Advanced Education. It chose to merge with the latter advanced college resulting in the establishment of the University of South Australia, which continues to remain neighbours with the University of Adelaide.

The University of South Australia became the state&#x27;s third public university, a continuation of the former South Australian Institute of Technology that merged with most of the SACAE, and maintained their historical presence next to the University of Adelaide, in the suburbs of Mawson Lakes and Magill and in the regional city of Whyalla. Its expansion over the next few decades, including to sites on the west end of North Terrace, and broadening fields of studies contributed to its status as the state&#x27;s largest university by student population. It also became the second-largest university nationally by number of online students, either in the state or from other parts of the country, and expanded to Mount Gambier in 2005.

=== Merger progression ===
In June 2018, the University of Adelaide and University of South Australia began discussions regarding the possibility of a merger. The proposition was dubbed a &quot;super uni&quot; by then South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, and Simon Birmingham, but the merger was called off in October 2018 by the University of South Australia, which was less keen. Vice-chancellor David Lloyd, in an email to University of South Australia staff, claimed that the amalgamation lacked a compelling case. This statement was contradicted by the University of Adelaide&#x27;s chancellor who said that the merger continues to be in the state&#x27;s best interests and a spokesperson for the university added that it was still open to future talks. Following the release of several internal FOI documents retrieved by &quot;ABC News&quot;, it was later revealed that the merger talks failed due to disagreements on the post-merger institution&#x27;s leadership structure. The name &quot;Adelaide University of South Australia&quot; was agreed upon by both universities and Chris Schacht, who previously served on the University of Adelaide Council, alleged that the merger talks failed due to disagreement on which vice-chancellor would replace the other following their amalgamation.

In early 2022, the topic of a merger was raised again by the new state government led by premier Peter Malinauskas, which proposed setting up an independent commission to investigate the possibility of a merger between the state&#x27;s three public universities should they decline. He had made an election promise to take a heavy-handed approach towards the merger to reduce students departing to higher-ranking institutions on the east coast and to improve the state&#x27;s ability to attract international students and researchers. At the time, staff&#x27;s opinions were evenly divided on the idea of the commission. Following the appointment of merger advocate Peter Høj as University of Adelaide vice-chancellor, both universities announced that a merger would once again be considered. The universities began a feasibility study into a potential merger at the end of the year. The invitation to merger negotiations was rejected by Flinders University, the state&#x27;s third public university.

The agreement for the merger was reached on 1 July 2023 by the two universities, which then accounted for approximately two-thirds of the state&#x27;s public university population, in consultation with the South Australian Government. The rationale for the amalgamation was a larger institutional scale may be needed in order to increase the universities&#x27; ranking positions, ability to secure future research income and a net positive impact on the state economy. The two universities argued that by combining their expertise, resources and finances into a single institution, they can be more financially viable, with stronger teaching and research outcomes. Support for the merger among existing staff were mixed, with a National Tertiary Education Union SA survey showing that only a quarter were in favour of the amalgamation. Warren Bebbington, who previously served as vice-chancellor at the University of Adelaide, described the proposed institution as a &quot;lumbering dinosaur&quot; in reference to its timing during an ongoing federal review of the higher education sector. Vice-chancellor Colin Stirling described plans to provide the new institution with in research funding and scholarships as &quot;unfair&quot; to students who choose to study at Flinders University. The combined figure was later revised to to include land purchases, with an additional research fund set up for Flinders University.

In November 2023, legislation passed state parliament enabling the creation of the new university to be named &quot;Adelaide University&quot;, previously a colloquial name used by the University of Adelaide. An application for self-accreditation authority was submitted to the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA) on 15 January 2024, which was needed for the institution to offer courses that issue qualifications. Following approval on 22 May 2024, students starting studies at the pre-merger institutions from 2025 onwards will be issued degree certificates from Adelaide University. Students enrolled on or prior to 2024 will also be able to opt in adding antecedent institutions&#x27; names and logos on their parchments. The combined institution is expected to become operational by January 2026, with an additional transitional period extending to 2034. It is projected to have 70,000 students at launch, with one-in-four students being international students, and contribute approximately to the Australian economy annually. The amalgamation has been subject to mixed reactions.

==Campuses and buildings==
The university will inherit seven campuses in South Australia, including its flagship Adelaide City campus. There include:

===Adelaide City===
The Adelaide city campus will combine four adjacent campuses located across North Terrace, one of four terraces bounding the Adelaide city centre. On the east end of the terrace, the campus will be co-located with the historical Royal South Australian Society of Arts which included the Art Gallery of South Australia, the South Australian Museum and the State Library of South Australia. Built in the Gothic Revival architecture style in 1882, the Mitchell Building is the oldest building on the campus. It was called the University Building until 1961 when it was renamed after William Mitchell. The Brookman Building, constructed in 1903 and named after its benefactor George Brookman, formed part of the original School of Mines and Industries later renamed to the South Australian Institute of Technology. It was inherited by the University of South Australia, which later expanded to the west end of the terrace.

Bonython Hall, a great hall of the university, was built in 1936 following a donation of over £50,000 from the owner of &quot;The Advertiser&quot; newspaper, John Langdon Bonython, who was inspired following his visit to the Great Hall of the University of Sydney. The hall, which has been used during graduation ceremonies among other events, was designed by architect Louis Laybourne-Smith based on medieval great halls in a Gothic Revival architecture style inspired by the ancient universities in Europe. In between it and the Mitchell Building, which both face the terrace, is the Elder Hall which is its oldest great hall on the site. It is a large concert hall that is used by the Elder Conservatorium of Music among others and, along with Bonython Hall, both feature large organs.

The campus also includes other venues including the Scott Theatre, Little Theatre and the College Green. The Scott Theatre is the largest lecture theatre on site and is often hired out for performances of various kinds such as the Adelaide Fringe events. It features two revolving stages and a seating capacity of 635 people. The Little Theatre is located in the Cloisters and is primarily used for dramatic performances by the Theatre Guild. The College Green stretches from the Cloisters across the lawns down to Victoria Drive, next to the River Torrens. It hosts various social events throughout the year including parties, live bands, DJs and open-air cinema among others. It was created in response to the impact of social distancing restrictions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, which hit many live music venues.

The Barr Smith Library is the largest library on the site and is notable for its opulent reading room. The Napier and Ligertwood Buildings were built following the demolition of the Jubilee Exhibition Building in 1962. They are named after Mellis Napier and George Ligertwood who were both former chancellors. Some other notable buildings on the east end of the campus include the Ingkarni Wardli Building, Darling Building, Hartley Building, Mawson Building, Playford Building, Basil Hetzel Building, Bonython Jubilee Building, Centenary Building and the Helen Mayo North and South Buildings. The Braggs Building, named after two Nobel laureates associated with the university, was built in 2013 and features a large number of cross-disciplinary scientific research facilities. The Adelaide University Footbridge was constructed in 1937 following a decade of delays during the Great Depression. The footbridge, which crosses the River Torrens, features cast iron balustrading that is a popular location for love locks.

The Adelaide University Union redevelopment, also known as Union Buildings or Union Building Group, was completed in stages between 1967 and 1975. It created some of the most significant buildings in the complex. The redevelopment was designed by lead architect Robert Dickson and includes a heritage-listed group of buildings including the Union House, the Lady Symon Building named after the wife of Josiah Symon, the George Murray Building, the Cloisters and the Western Annexe. The earlier Georgian-style buildings were designed by the architects Woods, Bagot, Jory and Laybourne-Smith who also designed Bonython Hall, the Mitchell Gates, the Johnson Laboratories, the Barr Smith Library and the Benham Laboratories. The Adelaide University Union Cloisters were built in 1929 as a war memorial to the 470 University of Adelaide members who served during World War I, of which 64 had died during the war. There are three plaques on the site, with the latest added in 2015 to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli landing.

The campus also incorporates part of the adjacent Lot Fourteen precinct, that is also home to the national headquarters of the Australian Space Agency among other institutions in the fields of science and technology. As part of the merger, its presence in the area will be expanded with the Australian Defence Technologies Academy to be located in the under-construction &quot;Innovation Centre&quot;, also to be home to the Space Assembly Integration and Testing Facility. The National Wine Centre further along of the terrace and adjacent to the Adelaide Botanic Garden forms the easternmost extent of the city campus.

Although both universities had a major presence in the east end, its sites on the west end are primarily occupied by the University of South Australia with the exception of the Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences Building. As the university had expanded to the west over several decades following its establishment, the buildings on the site are considerably newer than on the east. The Bradley Building and the Adelaide Health and Medical Sciences Building, which are home to various clinical and simulation facilities in the fields of healthcare and medicine, form part of the Adelaide BioMed City Precinct which also includes the affiliated Royal Adelaide Hospital and the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.The Jeffrey Smart Building, named after artist Jeffrey Smart, was constructed in 2014. It is a student hub that comprises &quot;open plan&quot; teaching and learning spaces, the main library on the east end and a central green common area with an outdoor cinema. The adjacent Hawke Building is named after former prime minister Bob Hawke and was constructed in 2007. It is home to the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre, Kerry Packer Civic Gallery, Samstag Museum, the Allan Scott Auditorium with a seating capacity of 400 seats and the Bradley Forum with 150 seats.

Pridham Hall is a gymnasium and multi-sport facility constructed in 2018. It was designed as a collaboration between Norwegian architecture firm Snøhetta, JPE Design Studio and JamFactory. It features a heated swimming pool, gymnasium, dance studio, a sloping roof amphitheatre and a convertible great hall that can be used for both sports or hosting events with up to 2,000 attendees. It was funded largely by alumni, including its namesake Andrew Pridham and his family who donated toward its construction. Other buildings on the east end include the Kaurna Building, Barbara Hanrahan Building, Yungondi Building, Lewis O’Brien Building, Elton Mayo Building, David Pank Building, Catherine Helen Spence Building, Dorrit Black Building, Way Lee Building, Sir George Kingston Building, Sir Hans Heysen Building, Rowland Rees Building, Liverpool Street Studios and the Enterprise Hub.

=== Magill ===

The Magill campus was established in 1973 and is located on St Bernards Road in the eastern Adelaide suburb of Magill. The campus specialises in the social sciences, psychology, neuroscience, teacher education, sports science, journalism, creative industries, human services, social work, media and communication. It also hosts several media studios, research laboratories, health clinics, a Samsung SMARTSchool and the de Lissa Institute of Early Childhood and Family Studies named after Montessori education pioneer Lillian Daphne de Lissa.

The parkland campus includes the heritage-listed Murray House, named after Scottish-born pastoralist Alexander Borthwick Murray. Built in 1884 and later expanded, the stone building incorporates Victorian-era Italianate and Gothic Revival architecture styles. According to legend, a blonde girl or young woman in Victorian-era attire named &quot;May&quot; supposedly haunts the manor, scaring patrons from the balcony or stairways. The urban myth, one of many supposed &quot;Ghosts of Murray Park&quot;, are akin to the white lady phenomenon in other parts of the world. The house replaced an earlier home built in 1854.

As part of the merger, the entirety of the University of South Australia campus has been sold for housing and commercial re-development. Approximately half of the campus is currently leased back to the university for a period of up to 10 years.

=== Mawson Lakes ===
The Mawson Lakes campus, established in 1972 as &quot;The Levels&quot;, is located in the northern Adelaide suburb of Mawson Lakes along of wetlands. It specialises in fields of science, engineering, computer science, environmental sciences, civil aviation and teacher education. It is also home to the Adelaide Planetarium and several information technology and engineering laboratories, including a defence research lab and the Future Industries Institute. The campus also has Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 flight and airport simulators and offers pilot training through its aviation academy at the nearby Parafield Airport.

It is also neighbours with the Adelaide Technology Park which is home to the Australian offices of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Saab among other multinational companies in the space and defence technology sectors.

As part of the merger, more than half of the campus has been sold for housing and commercial development. It is one of two campuses belonging to the University of South Australia where land was sold.

===Waite===
The Waite campus specialises in agricultural science, viticulture, oenology, plant breeding, food research and biotechnology. It is located in the suburb of Urrbrae in Adelaide&#x27;s eastern foothills, adjacent to the Urrbrae Agricultural High School, on of which a large amount was donated through the will of Scottish-born pastoralist Peter Waite. Approximately half of the land donated was dedicated for studies in agriculture and the remainder as a public park. The Waite Research Precinct is home to several research centres.

The Waite Agricultural Research Institute was established in 1924. Its first director was Arnold E. V. Richardson. Later renamed to the Waite Research Institute, it produces approximately 70% of Australia&#x27;s research output in viticulture and oenology and around 80% of cereal varieties used in southern Australia were created there. A Soil Research Centre was founded in 1929 with a donation of £10,000 from Harold Darling of J. Darling and Son, grain merchants. In 2004, State Premier Mike Rann opened the A$9.2 million Plant Genomics Centre at the campus. In 2010, he opened The Plant Accelerator, a A$30 million research facility which is the largest and most advanced of its kind in the world.

A number of other organisations are co-located in the precinct including the South Australian Research and Development Institute (or &quot;SARDI&quot;, part of Primary Industries and Regions SA which is also headquartered at the campus), Australian Grain Technologies, Australian Wine Research Institute and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).

The Urrbrae House built in 1891, now a museum, served as the home of Peter and Matilda Waite who purchased the land with support from Thomas Elder. Its interior is designed by Aldam Heaton &amp; Co, who was also responsible for designing interiors for the Titanic. The campus is also home to the Waite Arboretum and Conservation Reserve. The Waite Arboretum is a tree museum which is home to over 2,500 tree specimens from over 1,000 taxa, many of which are endangered in the wild. The Waite Conservation Reserve, also co-located on the campus, is home to native plants and wildlife.

===Roseworthy===


Located north of the city, the Roseworthy campus comprises of farmland and is a large centre for agricultural research and veterinary sciences. It was the site of the former Roseworthy Agricultural College which was established in 1883 as the first agricultural college in Australia. The Roseworthy College Hall, now the student hub, is the main building on the campus and was built in 1884. Its clock tower features a Swiss precision clock that is synced via GPS with Greenwich Mean Time. The clock tower was missing a clock for more than 120 years until 2003, when the mechanism was finally added following a donation. The colleges&#x27; teaching and research in oenology and viticulture were transferred to the Waite campus, along with the bulk of its work in plant breeding. Before studies in oenology were transferred to the Waite campus, the college had produced a number of highly regarded and awarded winemakers and wine critics.

Following the merger, the campus expanded its focus in dryland agriculture, natural resource management and animal production by the mid-1990s. The campus is also now home to South Australia&#x27;s first veterinary science training program, which commenced in 2008. The Veterinary Science Centre houses teaching facilities including a surgical skills suite, a public veterinary clinic offering general practice as well as emergency and specialist veterinary services for pet animals. There are also specialised pathology laboratories at the centre for teaching, research and diagnostics. In 2013, the veterinary science facilities were expanded with the opening of the Equine Health and Performance Centre, a specialised facility for equine surgery, internal medicine, sports medicine and reproduction.

The Memorial Chapel is a notable building on the Roseworthy campus. It was built in 1955 to memorialise students from the former college who died during World War I, World War II and the Boer Wars. The entrance features a limestone statue of a young soldier &quot;discarding his uniform in readiness to return to the land&quot;. The organ of the chapel was donated by the mother of a student that died in New Guinea during World War II. There is a time capsule from 1976 located near the chapel. It is expected to be opened in 2026.

In 2021, the Roseworthy Solar and Energy Storage Project was opened on the campus. It included a solar farm with an output of 1.2MW with a 420/1200kWh hybrid battery. Its 3,200 solar panels are estimated to produce 42% of the campus&#x27; energy requirements.

=== Whyalla ===
The Whyalla campus was established in 1962 and is the largest regional campus in South Australia. Located in city of Whyalla in the Eyre Peninsula, it is set on and offers studies in teacher education, nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, social work and human services.

=== Mount Gambier ===
Based in the Limestone Coast, the Mount Gambier campus was established in 2005 and offers studies in commerce, teacher education, nursing, midwifery, social work and human services. It is located in Mount Gambier, the largest regional city in South Australia. The campus also conducts research on forest management.

==Governance and structure==
The university is currently governed by the Adelaide University Transition Council established by the Joint Committee. It established the Transitional Academic Board, which will be responsible for academic operations.

=== Colleges and Schools ===
Research and teaching is currently divided between the two foundation universities. The University of Adelaide has three faculties divided into 25 constituent schools and the University of South Australia is divided into seven academic units. The establishment of faculties and academic departments of the merged &quot;Adelaide University&quot; will formally be the responsibility of its University Council.

Adelaide University plans to be organised into six colleges, each with various discipline-based schools:

=== University Council ===
The main governing body of the institution will be its Council. It will be the executive committee responsible for managing operations, setting policies and appointing the chancellor and vice-chancellor. The Council will comprise: the chancellor, vice-chancellor, a member of the academic staff, a member of the professional staff, an undergraduate student, a postgraduate student, at least one member with a commercial background, two members with prior experience in financial management and other members appointed by the selection committee. The selection committee, which will comprise the chancellor and six other appointed members, can appoint members to the Council to serve for between 2 and 4 years. This excludes elected staff and student members, which have a term limit of 2 years.
==== Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor ====
The chancellor of the university is a limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held by former University of South Australia chancellor Pauline Carr who was succeeded by John Hill at the latter office in May 2024. Pauline was appointed by the Transition Council. The current co-vice-chancellors are biochemists Peter Høj and David Lloyd, who are concurrently vice-chancellors of the University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia respectively. While the chancellor&#x27;s office is ceremonial, the vice-chancellor serves as the university&#x27;s de facto principal administrative officer. The university&#x27;s internal governance will be carried out by the University Council to be formed through the Adelaide University Act 2023.

=== Finances ===
In 2023, the two antecedent universities had a combined revenue of (2022 – ), a combined expenditure of (2022 – ) and combined net assets of (2022 – ).

== Academic profile ==
Adelaide University has been invited to become a member of the Group of Eight, a coalition of research-led Australian universities. The university is expected to continue its presence in the Adelaide BioMed City research precinct and remain in Lot Fourteen next to the Australian Space Agency headquarters. As part of the merger, the Australian Defence Technologies Academy will also be opened in Lot Fourteen in the under-construction &quot;Innovation Centre&quot;, also to be home to the Space Assembly Integration and Testing Facility. In 2024, BAE Systems announced that it will establish its Australian headquarters at the centre.

The Mawson Lakes campus will also be adjacent to the Adelaide Technology Park which is home to the Australian offices of Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Saab among other multinational companies in the space and defence technology sectors.

The antecedent universities also offers some degree programs in Brisbane, Singapore and Hong Kong as part of a joint ventures with local institutions.

=== Research and publications ===
In the 2018 ERA National Report, the Australian Research Council evaluated work produced between 2014 and 2018. 100 per cent of research activity at both antecedent universities were judged to be &quot;at or above world standard&quot; (3–5*).

=== Academic reputation ===
The state government projects that the university will rank within the top 100 universities following the merger. In the 2024 &quot;Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities&quot;, which measures aggregate performance across the QS, Times and ARWU rankings, the University of Adelaide attained a position of #91 (8th nationally) and the University of South Australia attained a position of #313 (22nd nationally).

==== National publications ====
In the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; Best Universities Ranking 2024, the University of Adelaide was ranked #5 amongst Australian universities and the University of South Australia attained a position of #15.

==== Global publications ====
In the 2025 &quot;Quacquarelli Symonds&quot; World University Rankings (published 2024), the University of Adelaide tied 82nd place (8th nationally) and the University of South Australia tied 340th place (22nd nationally).

In the 2025 &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; World University Rankings, the University of Adelaide tied 128th place (7th nationally) and the University of South Australia attained a position of #301-350 (tied 20-24th nationally).

In the 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities, the University of Adelaide attained a position of #151-200 (8th nationally) and the University of South Australia attained a position of #401-500 (tied 22-24th nationally).

In the 2024-2025 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Global Universities rankings, the University of Adelaide attained a position of #92 (9th nationally) and the University of South Australia attained a position of #378 (24th nationally).

In the CWTS Leiden Ranking 2024, the University of Adelaide attained a position of #205 (7th nationally) and the University of South Australia attained a position of #564 (23th nationally).


=== Admissions process ===
Students starting studies at the two universities from 2025 onwards will be issued degree certificates from Adelaide University with alumni and continuing students having the option to add antecedent institutions&#x27; names and logos on their parchments.

The admissions process for entry into the two universities is managed by the South Australian Tertiary Admissions Centre. Established in 1977, it is the main administrative body processing applications for tertiary institutions in South Australia and the Northern Territory. International students can also apply directly to the university for the 2026 academic year.

Qualifications that can be used for consideration include Australian and New Zealand high school certificates or international equivalent, a Grade Point Average from prior higher education, TAFE and other RTO qualifications, competitive scores from a Skills for Tertiary Admissions Test and prior work experience or military service with the Australian Defence Force. Some courses have additional pre-requisites.

Additionally, the University of Adelaide College, South Australian Institute of Business and Technology, Eynesbury College, the English Language Centre and TAFE South Australia offer pathways into university programs.

=== Academic calendar ===
The academic year is expected to be divided into three trimesters lasting 10 weeks each.

== Libraries and archives ==
There are currently nine libraries located across the seven planned campuses.

=== Barr Smith Library ===

The Barr Smith Library is the third-oldest university library in Australia and was originally located in the Mitchell Building.

The library purchased its first book in 1877 for £11, prior to its formal establishment in 1882. It was later named after its founder Robert Barr Smith who throughout his life had donated £9,000 to purchase books towards the struggling library, which previously had no librarian and an annual budget of £200 of which £150 were spent on books. William Barlow, the registrar, acted as the &quot;de facto&quot; first librarian of the then-small library and R. J. M. Clucas was the first &quot;official&quot; librarian in 1900.
Following Robert&#x27;s death in 1915, an additional endowment of £11,000 in 1920 was made by his family. In 1928, his son Tony Elder Barr Smith donated almost £35,000 towards a new building for the library to reduce congestion at its original site. Robert&#x27;s granddaughter Christine Margaret Mcgregor also donated almost 5,000 books in 1974. The building was designed in the Georgian Revival architecture style by Walter Hervey Bagot of the Adelaide-based architecture firm Woods, Bagot &amp; Laybourne Smith and was inspired by Kensington Palace in London. Following its completion, its collection was transferred from the Mitchell Building through a zip line. The building features red-brick exteriors with an entrance with Corinthian pillars below an inscription reading &quot;The Barr Smith Library&quot;. It was later expanded twice to increase capacity, reaching a peak of 2.4 million books in 2014.The Barr Smith Reading Room is a notable feature of the library on Level 2. It features oak flooring and furniture with white pillars holding the gilded and ivory arches that form the rounded ceiling. Between the pillars and the arches are two large Latin inscriptions that run across both sides of the room in gold and commemorate the donations from Robert and his family who played a major role in its development. In mid-2023, over 61 paper planes were found in ledges around the ceiling of the reading room, including one made using a university brochure dating back to 1991.

The library is also home to a collection of rare books, the archives documenting the development of the both universities among other collections across various subject areas. This includes books belonging to Samuel Way&#x27;s collection, who had donated 16,000 books.

=== David Murray Library ===
Established in 1903, the David Murray Library is located in the Brookman Building. It is named after Scottish-born merchant and politician David Murray who donated £2000 towards the library.

=== Sir John Salmond Law Library ===
Established in 1883, the Sir John Salmond Law Library holds a collection of legal works from Australian and overseas sources including the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. In 1967, the law library moved to the Ligertwood Building, which was among those that replaced the demolished Jubilee Exhibition Building. It was renamed two years later after John William Salmond who was the third Professor of Law at the Adelaide Law School.

=== Jeffrey Smart Building ===
The Jeffrey Smart Building, named after artist Jeffrey Smart, is a library on the east end of North Terrace. It comprises &quot;open plan&quot; teaching and learning spaces and a central green common area.

=== Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Library ===

The Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial is the prime ministerial library of Bob Hawke who served between 1983 and 1991. Established in 1997, it was the first of its kind in the world to be founded during the lifetime of a prime minister. The Bob Hawke Collection forms the bulk of its archives and includes a large collection of his notes, personal papers, state gifts, biographical texts, newspaper extracts, photographs, political comics, articles, recordings and transcripts of speeches and media events, including documents from ministers from his cabinet. Notable artefacts held at the library include a hide belt gifted by former President Ronald Reagan, the jacket he wore to the 1983 America&#x27;s Cup celebrations, a replica of a Panther Model 100 motorcycle that he crashed as a university student and several prime ministerial briefcases. The library, which was expanded following his death in 2019, is located in the Hawke Centre.

=== Julia Gillard Prime Ministerial Library ===
The Julia Gillard Prime Ministerial Library is the planned prime ministerial library of Julia Gillard who served between 2010 and 2013. It is a collaborative effort with the National Archives of Australia and will include documents from the her career and prime ministerialship. It is expected to open in 2027 and will be located in the Hartley Building, which will also play host to the annual Julia Gillard Public Lecture, research and other programs.

=== Roseworthy Library ===

The Roseworthy Campus Library, formerly the Roseworthy Agricultural College Library, is located on the Roseworthy campus.

It dates back to the former Tassie Memorial Library which was funded by John Tassie in 1920. It was built as a memorial to his son, also named John Tassie, who was a student at the then Roseworthy College who died during World War I in France. It was later expanded in 1945 through donations by A Lowrie, the widow of former principal William Lowrie. The William Lowrie Memorial Annexe, which connected to the previous library in a T-shape, was completed in 1947. The library moved to its current site in 1974 due to increasing size constraints with the former site now used as a gymnasium.

=== Waite Woolhouse Library ===

The Waite Campus Library, also known as the Woolhouse Library, is located on the Waite campus in Urrbrae.

=== Other libraries ===
The Mawson Lakes and Magill campuses also have their own libraries. The State Library of South Australia will also be co-located with the university.

== Museums and galleries ==
The university is expected to inherit several museums, galleries and other exhibitions from its antecedent institutions. These include:

=== MOD. ===
MOD. (Museum of Discovery) is described as &quot;a futuristic museum of discovery&quot; featuring exhibitions designed by researchers to showcase &quot;how research shapes our understanding of the world around us to inform our futures&quot;. It is located in the Bradley Building.

=== Samstag Museum of Art ===

The Samstag Museum of Art is a contemporary art gallery located at the Hawke Building. Established in 2007, its history dates back to 1977 as the &quot;College Gallery&quot;. It is named after Anne and Gordon Samstag and is located at the Hawke Building.

=== Adelaide Planetarium ===
Constructed in 1972, the Adelaide Planetarium is a planetarium at the Mawson Lakes campus. It hosts public exhibitions and short courses that are open to the public.

=== Architecture Museum ===
The Architecture Museum includes a collection of 400,000 items including drawings, photographs, correspondence, photographs and personal papers mostly donated by architects who worked in the state during the 20th century. It is also a library comprising books, journal articles, research and other literature. It was formally established in 2005, though the collection has been available to the public since the 1990s. Its early collection was donated by Donald Leslie Johnson, an architecture historian and curator, who began collecting the works in the 1970s due to a lack of a repository in the state. The museum, which also conducts research in the field of architecture and the built environment, is located in the Kaurna Building.

=== Tate Museum ===
The Tate Museum is one of the largest geological museums in Australia with a collection of approximately 29,000 rocks and fossils including meteorites, tektites, asteroids and specimens of early life. It was established in 1902 following the death of its namesake botanist and geologist Ralph Tate, though the museum existed informally since 1881 when he first began the collection. In 1952, it moved from the former Prince of Wales Building to the Mawson Laboratories named after geologist and explorer Douglas Mawson. The museum also hosts artefacts from Mawson&#x27;s various expeditions to the Antarctic, including one of his original sleighs. Its first official curator is Tony Milnes who had worked to restore and document the large collection. Notable specimens include some of earth&#x27;s earliest organisms, a number of which are from up to 550 million years ago, and segments of an asteroid that smashed into the state&#x27;s Gawler Ranges around 580 million years ago.

=== Waite Historic Precinct ===
The Waite Historic Precinct includes the Urrbrae House museum, Waite Arboretum and Waite Conservation Reserve. The museum resides in the former home of Peter Waite and was built in 1891. Its interior is designed by Aldam Heaton &amp; Co, who was also responsible for designing interiors for the Titanic. The Waite Arboretum, a tree museum, is home to over 2,500 tree specimens from over 1,000 taxa, many of which are endangered in the wild. The annual rainfall at the arboretum is 622mm. The Waite Conservation Reserve is home to native plants and fauna.

=== Other exhibitions ===

The SASA Gallery showcases creative works by students and researchers. It is located in the Kaurna Building. It is the modern descendant of the SA School of Art (SASA) established in 1856.

The Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre and Kerry Packer Civic Gallery have exhibitions that change regularly.

== Other divisions ==
Other planned divisions of the university include:

=== Elder Conservatorium ===
Established in 1883, the Elder Conservatorium of Music is the oldest tertiary music academy in Australia. It offers study and research programs in jazz, classical performance, musical theatre, classical voice, pop music, sonic arts, music production, song-writing, music composition, conducting, teaching, ensembles and performance studies. It is also home to the Australian String Quartet, Sia Furler Institute and the Centre for Aboriginal Studies in Music. The conservatorium also offers theatre performances and &quot;Lunchtime&quot; and &quot;After Hours&quot; concert series. The academy&#x27;s first Professor of Music was Cambridge graduate Joshua Ives, also the first professor of music in Australia. Edward Harold Davies was the first Australian to graduate with a Doctor of Music in 1902 and Ruby Claudia Davy was the first Australian woman to earn the doctorate.

The Elder Hall used by the conservatorium was built following the death of its namesake and music lover Thomas Elder who left £20,000 towards its construction. The founding stone, made from nearby gumtree, was placed on 26 September 1898 by then-state governor Thomas Fowell Buxton. The building was officially opened exactly two years later on 26 September 1900 in a formal ceremony despite having been already used for months. &quot;The South Australian Register&quot; reported the next day that the great hall was opened by Lord Tennyson &quot;&quot;positively for the last time&quot; and that &quot;the majority of those who were present had already attended at two more or less appropriate ceremonial openings of the Elder Hall&quot;&quot;. Its current organ is built by Casavant Fréres of Quebec in 1979, having replaced the previous Dodd organ that later was purchased by St Mark’s Cathedral in Port Pirie. The great hall was constructed in the Florentine Gothic architectural style integrating freestone from Mount Gambier.

=== National Wine Centre ===
Located in the Adelaide Park Lands at the eastern end of North Terrace, the National Wine Centre offers some of the university&#x27;s oenology courses. Opened in 2001, the facility also hosts public exhibitions about winemaking and its industry in South Australia. It contains an interactive permanent exhibition of winemaking, introducing visitors to the technology, varieties and styles of wine. It also has wine tasting areas, giving visitors the opportunity to taste and compare wines from across Australia. The building, which is adjacent to the Adelaide Botanic Gardens, was designed by Phillip Cox and Grieve Gillett and uses building materials to reflect items used in making wine.

==Student life==

=== Student unions ===

The antecedent universities&#x27; two student unions, YouX and USASA, are expected to merge into one. YouX, which was founded in 1895, is one of the oldest students&#x27; unions in Australia. It was established by the founding clubs of its then-affiliated Adelaide University Sports Association, which was itself established the following year. USASA was founded in 1994.

===Student magazines===

The two student unions produce their own student magazines. YouX produces the &quot;On Dit&quot; magazine, pronounced &quot;on-dee&quot; after the French expression &quot;we say&quot;, which was established in 1932 as the second-oldest student-run print media in Australia. Former writers of the newspaper include several federal politicians including former prime minister Julia Gillard. USASA produces the &quot;Verse Magazine&quot; which was established in 2014 and has an annual print run of 12,000 copies. The two magazine publish artwork and written pieces including campus news, creative writing, essays, exposés, opinion pieces, photography, poetry, reviews and visual art.
===Sports and athletics===

The two universities currently have their own sports associations that compete at the UniSport Nationals and the state-level SA Challenge intervarsity competitions.

==== University of Adelaide ====
Established in 1896, Adelaide University Sport has 37 sports clubs, including its three founding clubs that predate its establishment. Its historical motto is &quot;Mobilitate Vigemus&quot; translated &quot;we thrive by mobility&quot;. Its sporting colours black and white are likely from the white-backed magpie, an Australian bird found on its crest and the state badge. Its mascot is Gus, a black lion, which replaced the piping shrike on its historical crest.

==== University of South Australia ====
Founded in 2013, UniSA Sport has 28 sports clubs and competes as &quot;Team UniSA&quot;. It includes several clubs that predate the university. This includes its hockey club which was affiliated with the antecedent South Australian Institute of Technology since 1970.

=== Residential colleges ===
St. Mark&#x27;s College was founded in 1925 by the Anglican Diocese of Adelaide and is the oldest of the colleges. It was developed by some former residents of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge among others with the goal of developing a similar collegiate lifestyle.

Aquinas College was founded as a men&#x27;s college in 1950 by the Catholic Church at Montefiore House, the former residence of Samuel Way. It later expanded to surrounding sites and became co-residential in 1975.

St Ann&#x27;s College was founded as a women&#x27;s college in 1947. The college&#x27;s honorary founder is politician Josiah Symon who in 1924 suggested that female students should have somewhere to live. It became co-educational in 1973.

Lincoln College was founded in 1952 by the Methodist Church and named after the Lincoln College at the University of Oxford. Originally established as a men&#x27;s college, it became co-residential in 1973. It features several heritage-listed buildings.

There are also other private student accommodation providers in the city centre and near other campuses. Additionally, the Roseworthy and Whyalla campuses manage their own accommodation for students studying at those locations.

==Notable people==
Adelaide University alumni will include those of the two antecedent universities and their predecessor institutions. These include the first female Australian prime minister Julia Gillard, Singaporean presidents Tony Tan and Ong Teng Cheong, the first Australian-born astronaut Andy Thomas, the first demonstrator of nuclear fusion Mark Oliphant, the founding editor-in-chief of Vogue China Angelica Cheung, singer-songwriter Guy Sebastian, the industrialist Edward Holden who founded Australian automobile manufacturer GM Holden, the speech therapist Lionel Logue who helped King George VI manage his stammer, the inventor of modern sunscreen Milton Blake, Neil Weste whose advancements in wireless communications are widely used and several Olympians and Paralympians including Matthew Cowdrey. Incumbent office-holders include the state premier Peter Malinauskas, state governor Frances Adamson, the Human Rights Watch executive director Tirana Hassan, the national senate leader Penny Wong, the Australian National University chancellor Julie Bishop and several federal cabinet ministers. The two universities have also produced a combined 117 Rhodes scholars, 169 Fulbright scholars and three Nobel laureates. Its history include the development of penicillin, space exploration, sunscreen, the military tank, Wi-Fi, polymer banknotes and X-ray crystallography, and the study of viticulture and oenology.

=== Nobel laureates ===

Nobel laureates associated with the university include Lawrence Bragg, who held the record for the youngest laureate ever until 2014, co-recipient with his father William Henry Bragg for their work in x-ray crystallography in 1915. Howard Florey, a pharmacologist and pathologist, shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Alexander Fleming and Ernst Chain for their role in the development of penicillin. J. M. Coetzee, a novelist and member of the faculty, had won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2003. Robin Warren was a pathologist who, alongside Barry Marshall, discovered that peptic ulcers were largely caused by the infection &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot;, graduated in 1961. Warren and Marshall won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery in 2005.

== Controversies ==

=== Initial merger discussions ===
The University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia had previously engaged to discuss a merger in 2018 but failed due to disagreements from the latter about the post-merger leadership structure.

=== Opinion polling on staff ===
The National Tertiary Education Union SA conducted a survey of 1,100 university staff and found that three-quarters of respondents were against the merger. In addition, the state government has been accused of coercing the universities to agree to merge, indicating that a commission of inquiry would be established to find ways to compel the two universities to merge had their councils refused to do so, with less financial support available.

Andrew Miller, the state secretary of the union, raised concerns that staff were under &quot;extreme psychosocial pressure&quot; to meet the 2026 launch deadline. Backing his claims with communications from the &quot;Integration Management Office&quot; staff responsible for merging the two institutions, he added that the &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; perception among staff competing &quot;for the final spots of the new Adelaide University&quot; was causing tensions, breakdowns and disharmony. The institutions&#x27; vice-chancellors David Lloyd and Peter Høj criticised the claims, referring to them as &quot;whispers of Little Birds or Littlefingers&quot;, though they had previously admitted that the &quot;two-by-two approach across the board&quot; was &quot;not as linear as first conceived”.

Despite previous polls claiming low support from staff, the vice-chancellors added that the over 3,000 staff who attended the July 2024 Adelaide University launch event were enthusiastic about the new brand identity. They also wrote that criticism should instead be directed towards the proposed caps to international students caused by a national housing shortage.

The post-merger plan to switch to a trimester academic calendar has also been criticised by the union whose internal poll showed that more than 4 in 5 members were against the move. The University of New South Wales had previously also switched to a trimester model, allowing students to complete a 3 year bachelor&#x27;s degree program in 2 years with shorter breaks. As of 2024, UNSW is considering reversing the change following a 40% drop in paid hours for staff, decreased time for non-academic activities and student burnout from increased workload.

=== Land re-development ===
In February 2024, the State Government drew criticism for its plans to convert land it had purchased from two University of South Australia campuses for housing and commercial re-development. As part of the merger agreement, the land was to be sold to the South Australian Government for and leased back to the university for a period of up to 10 years. Following the release of several internal FOI documents retrieved by &quot;InDaily&quot; from the Premier&#x27;s Office, it was later revealed that the land was &quot;earmarked for future development&quot; for residential and commercial purposes.

The original media release replaced the phrase with &quot;short-term transitional lease to university&quot;, referring to the leaseback period of 10 years, following concerns from UniSA vice-chancellor David Lloyd that the original draft would &quot;create enormous community reaction which will be particularly unhelpful at this time&quot;. The land sales account for the entirety of the Magill campus and approximately 50% of the Mawson Lakes campus.

== Gallery ==
==Tram stop==
The planned Adelaide City campus currently has two stops on the Glenelg tram line, &quot;University&quot; and &quot;City West&quot;, which will connect the east and west end of the campus along North Terrace.

<text>WDBB (channel 17) is a television station licensed to Bessemer, Alabama, United States, serving Tuscaloosa and west Alabama as a satellite of Birmingham-based CW affiliate WTTO (channel 21, licensed to Homewood). It is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting, a partner company of the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns WTTO, MyNetworkTV affiliate WABM (channel 68), and regional ABC affiliate WBMA-LD (channel 58), which WDBB also rebroadcasts. Sinclair supplies all of WDBB&#x27;s programming under a programming services agreement, a form of local marketing agreement. However, Sinclair effectively owns WDBB, as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The transmitter is located near Windham Springs, east of State Route 69.

WDBB was started a local independent station by Dubose Broadcasting in 1984; it soon expanded to cover Birmingham. In 1986, the station launched WNAL-TV (channel 44) in Gadsden, which together with WDBB provided regional coverage. WDBB-WNAL served as the Fox Broadcasting Company affiliate for the Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, and Anniston–Gadsden markets from the network&#x27;s launch in 1986 until 1990, when the affiliation went to WTTO; WDBB began simulcasting that station the next year due to financial difficulties. WDBB and WTTO lost Fox in 1996 due to a major regional shuffle of network affiliations, affiliating with The WB in 1997 and with The CW in 2006.

==History==
On March 23, 1983, Channel 17 of Tuscaloosa, Inc., filed an application with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to build a new commercial TV station in the city. Shareholders in the applicant were headlined by David R. Dubose, who was then the news director at WUAL-FM at the University of Alabama.

WDBB began broadcasting on October 8, 1984, from studios on Jug Factory Road. It served as Tuscaloosa&#x27;s second commercial station and first independent. It would not, however, remain focused on Tuscaloosa for long. Even though Birmingham was just barely large enough at the time to support two independent stations, WDBB felt there was room for another station in the market, particularly because Birmingham had only two TV newsrooms at the time. In 1985, it spent $3.5 million to upgrade its transmission facility, building a tower midway between Tuscaloosa and Birmingham. Activated in early 1986 alongside a translator in the immediate Birmingham area, W62BG, the improved signal earned WDBB a place on most cable systems in Jefferson County. In addition, it became the production home for the coaches shows of Alabama Crimson Tide athletics, and in 1986, it obtained exclusive market rights for them in Birmingham, displacing WBRC (channel 6) as their local broadcaster.

May 1, 1986, brought the launch of WNAL-TV, which—while independently owned—rebroadcast WDBB&#x27;s programming to eastern Alabama. Due to low ratings and the return of WBMG to the local news game, WDBB opted to cease local news in September 1986. However, the stations were about to get a lift; in October 1986, WDBB-WNAL became central Alabama&#x27;s first Fox affiliate. It continued to air Fox programming until September 1, 1990, when Fox moved to WTTO.

In the late 1980s, WDBB had several disputes over its rating status in the Birmingham area of dominant influence (ADI) as measured by Arbitron, then one of two companies that produced television ratings. It had asked Arbitron in 1985 to be listed in the Birmingham ratings instead of Tuscaloosa, then a separate and far smaller ADI. The next year, Arbitron agreed as long as viewership was combined with WNAL; however, after less than a year, Arbitron rescinded this arrangement after being pressured by competing stations in Birmingham and having NBC affiliate WVTM-TV cancel its contract. In 1989, a federal jury awarded WDBB and WNAL $5.5 million in damages, finding Arbitron guilty of fraud and breach of contract. In 1990, the station also filed to change its city of license to Bessemer, a suburb of Birmingham, in order to be placed within the Birmingham ADI; the FCC turned the request down. WDBB would ultimately win reassignment in 1996 after contesting the FCC&#x27;s decision, with the review finding Bessemer was independent enough of Birmingham to be allotted the station.

Due to financial difficulties, WDBB and WNAL began simulcasting WTTO on January 30, 1991. In return, WTTO added several of WDBB&#x27;s stronger syndicated programs to its schedule. In addition to programming contracts, WTTO also purchased WDBB&#x27;s Birmingham business offices and W62BG, and WDBB moved operations back to the Jug Factory Road site. The structure of WTTO&#x27;s relationship with WDBB and WNAL changed to one of an affiliation. Dubose also announced the addition of local programming, including news, to the station.

In 1994, Dubose sold the station to WDBB-TV Inc., a subsidiary of H&amp;P Communications of Las Vegas, for $2.5 million. At that time, channel 17 expanded to add noon and 5 p.m. newscasts. However, turmoil was roiling the Birmingham market. Earlier that year, WBRC was sold to New World Communications, which not only owned WVTM but had signed a deal to convert 12 stations into Fox affiliates, including WBRC. Due to ownership overlap, WBRC was sold directly to Fox in 1995. That would leave WTTO, WDBB, and WNAL out of an affiliation—and ABC without a carrier in Birmingham. All three stations began discussing affiliation with ABC; in fact, WDBB was already a year into negotiations by 1995. Amidst this uncertain backdrop, Sinclair moved to take programming control of WDBB in November 1995 with the signing of the programming services agreement. However, ABC bypassed Sinclair&#x27;s stations and instead opted to partner with Allbritton Communications to use WCFT in Tuscaloosa and WJSU in Anniston to start a new regional ABC affiliate. Sinclair moved to end the WDBB newscasts that December, putting 25 to 30 news staff and another 10 to 15 production employees out of work.

On September 1, 1996, WBRC became the new Fox affiliate for Birmingham, Tuscaloosa, and Anniston. WNAL-TV broke off to become the CBS affiliate for the Anniston–Gadsden area, and the other two stations continued as independents until affiliating with The WB in 1997. WTTO and WDBB became affiliates of The CW in 2006 when The WB and UPN merged. The license was transferred from H&amp;P to Cunningham in 2010.

==Subchannels==


In 2014, Sinclair purchased Allbritton Communications. However, it could not continue to own WCFT or WJSU without divestitures. Those stations were divested to Howard Stirk Holdings; in the case of the Tuscaloosa station, now WSES, ABC 33/40 moved to the WDBB multiplex.

<text>Historically, a master craftsman or master [[tradesman]] (sometimes called only master or grandmaster) was a member of a guild. The title survives as the highest professional qualification in craft industries.

In the European guild system, only masters and journeymen were allowed to be members of the guild. An aspiring master would have to pass through the career chain from [[apprentice]] to [[journeyman]] before he could be elected to become a master craftsman. He would then have to produce a sum of money and a masterpiece before he could actually join the guild. If the masterpiece was not accepted by the masters, he was not allowed to join the guild and possibly remained a journeyman for the rest of his life.

== Today&#x27;s master craftsman in different countries ==

=== Germany ===

In Germany, the master craftsman (Meister) is the highest professional qualification in crafts and is a state-approved grade. The certification is called Meisterbrief. The qualification includes theoretical and practical training in the craft as well as business and legal training. Additionally, it implies the qualification to train apprentices. These qualifications prepare the &quot;Meister&quot; for running their own business or alternatively for higher positions at a company. The status of master craftsmen is regulated in the German &quot;Gesetz zur Ordnung des Handwerks&quot; (Crafts and Trades Regulation Code).

Guilds have been abolished in Germany, but the ranks of apprentice (&quot;Lehrling&quot;), journeyman (&quot;Geselle&quot;) and master craftsman have been retained even through modern times. For safety-relevant crafts, e.g., electricians and chimney sweeps, any business in the trade has to be run by a master craftsman or has to employ at least one &quot;Meister&quot;.

Journeymen and master craftsmen are by law automatically members of their regional chamber of crafts (&quot;Handwerkskammer&quot;), which is a self-governing public body. The chamber organizes vocational training and oversees the examination of the journeymen and masters.

To become a master craftsman, it is usually required to have completed vocational training in the craft in which the examination is to be taken, culminating in a final examination called &quot;Gesellenprüfung&quot; (journeyman&#x27;s examination). If these requirements are fulfilled, the candidate can take courses for the &quot;Meisterprüfung&quot; (master craftsman&#x27;s examination). The duration of the courses takes 1 to 4 years depending on the craft and on the Course. The examination includes theoretical, practical and oral parts and takes 5 to 7 days (depending on the craft). In some crafts, the creation of a masterpiece is also part of the examination.

The German &quot;Meister&quot; qualifies the holder to study for a bachelor&#x27;s degree at university, whether the &quot;Meister&quot; holds a regular university entrance qualification or not. According to the German Qualifications Framework, the &quot;Meisterbrief&quot; is at the same level as a bachelor&#x27;s degree, even though it is not an academic degree and thus not directly comparable.

=== United Kingdom ===
This tradition originates in Medieval Europe. The earliest guilds were &quot;frith&quot; or &quot;peace&quot; guilds – groups bonded together for mutual protection following the breakdown of the kins, which were groups related by blood ties.

Merchant guilds – associations of international trades – were powerful in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but lost their ascendancy with the rise of the craft guilds – associations of master craftsmen, journeymen, apprentices and the various trades connected with a particular craft.

The College of Arms in London awarded a coat of arms of The Guild of Master Craftsmen in 1992, after four years of assessment. Designed by heraldic expert Peter Greenhill to reflect the many categories of guild membership, it features: three escutcheons (shields) to represent artists, painters and stainers; a pair of compasses opened in chevron for building, construction and carpentry; a dovetail (separating the top third of the shield from the rest) to represent cabinetmaking, woodworking and joinery; and a gavel and chisel for masons and stoneworkers. The southern keep of Lewes Castle, which overlooks the guild&#x27;s headquarters, is featured above the helmet as the crest.

=== United States ===
While for the most part guilds as such do not exist, many trades continue the apprentice-journeyman-master model: carpenters, electricians, pipefitters and plumbers are notable examples.

<doc id="628337" wikidata="Q5413663" url="?curid=628337" title="HMS Armada (D14)">
<text>HMS &quot;Armada&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named in honour of the English victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588. &quot;Armada&quot; was built by Hawthorn Leslie and Company on the Tyne. She was launched on 9 December 1943 and commissioned on 2 July 1945.

==Royal Navy service==
In 1945, &quot;Armada&quot; joined the British Pacific Fleet but did not see action during the Second World War. The following year, as part of the 19th Destroyer Flotilla, &quot;Armada&quot; deployed to the Far East, performing a variety of duties while based there, and the following year, &quot;Armada&quot;, with the rest of the 19th Flotilla, returned home to the UK, visiting a variety of ports on the way, mainly on &#x27;fly-the-flag&#x27; visits. Upon reaching the UK, &quot;Armada&quot; was placed in Reserve. In 1949, &quot;Armada&quot; joined the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, deploying to the Mediterranean as part of that flotilla.

In 1950, &quot;Armada&quot;, while still based in the Mediterranean, was involved in a collision. &quot;Armada&quot; remained in the sunny climes of the Mediterranean until returning home to the UK with the rest of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla. In 1956, &quot;Armada&quot; was in the area during the Suez Crisis in 1956, which took place in response to the Egyptian President Nasser&#x27;s nationalisation of the Suez Canal. She subsequently returned to home waters when she, now Captain (D) of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla, meaning that she was the leader of the flotilla, joined the Home Fleet.
In June, 1958 Armada provided escort for the Royal Yacht whilst the Queen visited North East England. Following this she steamed anti clockwise around Scotland and proceeded into the Mediterranean and then onto to the conflict in Cyprus patrolling up and down the west coast to prevent arms smuggling.

==Decommissioning and fate==
In 1960, &quot;Armada&quot; was decommissioned, and in 1965, she was sold to Thos. W. Ward for scrapping at Inverkeithing.

<text>WEAR-TV (channel 3) is a television station licensed to Pensacola, Florida, United States, serving as the ABC affiliate for northwest Florida and southwest Alabama. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside Fort Walton Beach–licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WFGX (channel 35); Sinclair also provides certain services to Mobile, Alabama–licensed NBC affiliate WPMI-TV (channel 15) and Pensacola-licensed independent station WJTC (channel 44) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Deerfield Media.

WEAR-TV and WFGX share studios—which also house master control and some internal operations for WPMI-TV and WJTC—on Mobile Highway (US 90) in unincorporated Escambia County, Florida (with a Pensacola mailing address); WEAR-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in unincorporated Baldwin County, Alabama (northeast of Robertsdale).

Although WEAR-TV&#x27;s call letters represent both the words &quot;wear&quot; and &quot;ear&quot;, the station spells out its calls as &quot;W-E-A-R&quot;, rather than any word.

==History==
In 1952, when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) lifted its four-year television applications freeze, WEAR (1230 AM) and WCOA (1370 AM) both filed for new stations on channel 3 at Pensacola. WCOA dropped its bid in June 1953, allowing WEAR to be granted the permit; the withdrawal was half of an agreement by which WEAR dropped an application for channel 36 in Jacksonville to allow WJHP, sister station to WCOA, to get that channel unopposed.

The station first signed on the air on January 13, 1954. Initially, the station was a primary CBS affiliate with a secondary ABC affiliation. In 1955, WKRG-TV (channel 5) signed on as the CBS affiliate for the Mobile-Pensacola area, and WEAR became an exclusive ABC affiliate. In 1959, it was sold to Rollins Telecasting, which completed a construction project already in progress: the completion of a new tower in Baldwin County. Rollins was purchased by Heritage Communications, an operator of cable systems in 1986; when Tele-Communications Inc. acquired the cable systems the next year, management carried out a leveraged buyout of the broadcast division to form Heritage Media.

In October 1997, WEAR and the other Heritage stations were sold to the Sinclair Broadcast Group just as the remainder of Heritage Media was merging with News Corporation (the then-parent company of Fox). This sale also protected former longtime NBC affiliate WALA-TV (channel 10) as the market&#x27;s Fox outlet; otherwise WEAR would have been forced to switch its network affiliation to Fox. Sinclair prohibited its ABC affiliates, including WEAR, from airing a &quot;Nightline&quot; broadcast in 2004 that featured a segment displaying the names of those who died in the war in Iraq, because the company felt it was anti-war rhetoric against the invasion.

In late 2006, Sinclair entered into negotiations with Mediacom, the main cable provider for parts of the Florida side of the market (including Santa Rosa County and Pensacola Beach). The two companies could not reach an agreement over retransmission fees. As a result, Mediacom pulled all of Sinclair&#x27;s stations (including WEAR) from its systems on January 6, 2007. The dispute ended on February 2, when the two sides reached an agreement that restored WEAR to Mediacom systems. Upon the expiration of the 2007 agreement on January 1, 2010, Mediacom was prepared to drop the station once again from its systems. Sinclair agreed to a temporary extension until January 8 in order to allow the Bowl Championship Series college football games to be viewed on Sinclair&#x27;s ABC and Fox affiliates over Mediacom. Eventually, a one-year agreement was reached which would keep Sinclair stations on the cable television provider until 2011.

In 2012, Newport Television sold five of its stations, including WPMI and WJTC, to Sinclair. However, since Sinclair already owns WEAR and WFGX, WPMI and WJTC were sold to Deerfield Media, while Sinclair operates the two stations under local marketing agreements. The sale created one of the few instances where two &quot;Big Three&quot; stations are operated by the same company. However, the two duopolies maintain separate operations.

==News operation==
WEAR-TV presently broadcasts hours of local newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, and two hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). In addition, the station produces an additional hours of newscasts weekly for WFGX (with a half-hour each weekday). This totals 38 hours of newscasts on a weekly basis between the two stations; in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among all broadcast television stations in the Mobile–Pensacola market (in contrast, WPMI produces 27 hours and WKRG produces 22 hours of newscasts each week).

Since WEAR is the only major-network station licensed on the Florida side of the market, the station&#x27;s newscasts tend to focus more on Pensacola. It does, however, operate a bureau on Dauphin Street in downtown Mobile. Because of WEAR&#x27;s then-hour-long 10 p.m. newscast, it was one of the last ABC affiliates to continue to air the network&#x27;s late night programming (including &quot;Nightline&quot; and presently &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; since the two shows switched timeslots nationally in January 2013) on a half-hour tape delay, starting at 11 p.m. The additional half-hour of the 10 p.m. broadcast began as &quot;Channel 3 News Extra&quot;, but has since evolved into an extension of the 10 p.m. newscast.

The station launched a 4 p.m. newscast in December 2007. On September 7, 2008, WEAR-TV was the first station in the Mobile–Pensacola market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition; field video remained pillarboxed for almost three years, until widescreen and eventually high definition video began supplementing the newscasts in 2011. On July 15, 2013, the weekday edition of WEAR&#x27;s morning newscast, &quot;3 in the Morning&quot; expanded by a half-hour, moving its start time to 4:30 a.m., putting them in competition with WALA&#x27;s already existing 4:30 a.m. newscast.

On August 12, 2013, WEAR launched a new half-hour, weeknight-only newscast at 9 p.m. on sister station WFGX. The newscast airs in direct competition with WALA&#x27;s long-established, dominant, and hour-long 9 p.m. newscast. This marked the first time that newscasts have aired on WFGX since it shut down its in-house news department in 1998 after two years (the 6:30 and 9 p.m. newscasts WFGX produced specifically focused on Okaloosa County, Florida).

===Notable former on-air staff===

* Mark Curtis – anchor/reporter (now at WOWK-TV in Charleston, West Virginia)

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WEAR formerly carried The Tube on its second digital subchannel until early 2007, when it was replaced with a standard definition feed of the station&#x27;s main channel, which lasted until around 2010. In 2011, The Country Network began occupying the second subchannel, after the network moved from sister station WFGX.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WEAR-TV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 17, using virtual channel 3.

<text>WFGX (channel 35) is a television station licensed to Fort Walton Beach, Florida, United States, serving northwest Florida and southwest Alabama as an affiliate of MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside Pensacola-licensed ABC affiliate WEAR-TV (channel 3); Sinclair also provides certain services to Mobile, Alabama–licensed NBC affiliate WPMI-TV (channel 15) and Pensacola-licensed independent station WJTC (channel 44) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Deerfield Media.

WFGX and WEAR-TV share studios—which also house master control and some internal operations for WPMI-TV and WJTC—on Mobile Highway (US 90) in unincorporated Escambia County, Florida (with a Pensacola mailing address); WFGX&#x27;s transmitter is located in unincorporated Baldwin County, Alabama (northeast of Robertsdale).

==History==
WFGX signed on the air on April 7, 1987, as an independent station; it was the second independent station on the Florida side of the market, after Pensacola-based WJTC.

In 1995, WFGX&#x27;s original local owners entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Heritage Media, then-owner of WEAR. This enabled WFGX to become the area&#x27;s WB affiliate on September 29, 1996, taking the affiliation from WBQP-CD. The station&#x27;s former analog signal on UHF channel 35 was very weak (509 kilowatts), resulting in marginal (at best) reception outside Okaloosa County. It was barely viewable even in Pensacola, and could not be seen at all over the air on the Alabama side of the market. Despite the shortfall in coverage, WFGX has long identified as &quot;Pensacola–Fort Walton Beach,&quot; which is unusual since the city of license is normally listed first when a station references another city in its legal on-air identification. It had to rely on cable and satellite carriage in order to reach the entire market.

Sinclair Broadcast Group took over WFGX&#x27;s operations after Heritage sold its television division to Sinclair in 1997. When the stronger WBPG (channel 55, now WFNA) signed on from Gulf Shores, Alabama, on September 2, 2001, it replaced WFGX as the area&#x27;s WB affiliate. WFGX then became an independent station, airing home shopping programming from Jewelry Television, syndicated shows and infomercials. Sinclair purchased WFGX outright in 2004.

On February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced that it would launch a new network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television. Sinclair opted to affiliate several of its stations (including WFGX) with the new programming service, which launched on September 5, 2006.

WFGX discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 35, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 50, using virtual channel 35.

At the same time, WFGX increased its digital signal to 1 million watts (equivalent to 5 million watts in analog), which was enough to provide a good signal to viewers in Pensacola. However, it was still practically unviewable on the Alabama side of the market. In July 2010, WFGX&#x27;s digital transmitter was moved from Gulf Breeze, Florida, to WEAR&#x27;s tower east of Rosinton, Alabama. With the same power output at the new location, it is now able to offer a signal comparable to those of the other full-powered stations in the market. Within two months, the station began offering a high definition signal over-the-air for the first time.

WFGX runs some programming from Sinclair&#x27;s Stadium network, mainly local sporting events that are part of the network&#x27;s national schedule (it otherwise airs on WPMI-DT3).

==Newscasts==

In 1996, WFGX began producing nightly newscasts at 6:30 and 9 p.m. called &quot;Emerald Coast News&quot; originating from its original studios on Beach Drive in Fort Walton Beach. Each broadcast aired for 30 minutes and stories on the newscasts specifically focused on Okaloosa County, Florida, helping to provide better coverage for WEAR. On December 11, 1998, &quot;Emerald Coast News&quot; was canceled by WFGX.

On August 12, 2013, sister station WEAR-TV began producing a weeknight-only, half-hour prime time newscast at 9 p.m. for WFGX. The newscast competes with Fox affiliate WALA-TV (channel 10)&#x27;s long established, dominant and hour-long 9 p.m. newscast, but due to WEAR&#x27;s Pensacola focus, provides some differing content from WALA&#x27;s Mobile-centric news operation.

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

==Cable and satellite coverage==
For most of its history, WFGX was unavailable to cable customers on the Alabama side of the market, largely because its analog signal could not be seen at all in that area. Comcast&#x27;s Mobile system did not carry WFGX until October 2010. Eventually, with the transmitter move to the WEAR tower, Sinclair was able to claim must-carry with retransmission consent, requiring cable providers to carry WFGX as a condition of carrying WEAR, and it was added to most market providers.

<text>WTTA (channel 38) is a television station licensed to St. Petersburg, Florida, United States, serving as the Tampa Bay area&#x27;s local outlet for The CW. It is owned and operated by The CW&#x27;s majority owner, Nexstar Media Group, alongside Tampa-licensed NBC affiliate WFLA-TV (channel 8) and Sarasota-based low-power MyNetworkTV affiliate WSNN-LD (channel 39). WTTA and WFLA-TV share studios on South Parker Street in downtown Tampa; through a channel sharing agreement, the two stations transmit using WFLA-TV&#x27;s spectrum from a transmitter in Riverview, Florida.

==Background==
The UHF channel 38 allotment in the Tampa–St. Petersburg market had previously been home to the area&#x27;s first television station, WSUN-TV, which operated from 1953 to 1970. The station, along with WSUN (620 AM), was originally licensed to the City of St. Petersburg. The transmitter was collocated in the WSUN transmitter building on the north side of the Gandy causeway at the west end of the Gandy Bridge. The transmitting antenna was mounted on top of the north tower of WSUN which was modified to hold it without exceeding the original AGL height. The north tower was and remains adjacent to the transmitter building used as a daytime 620 kHz non-directional radiator while the south tower, on the south side of the Gandy causeway was also used only at night as a directional array. The transmitter building still contains a ladder which descends into a bomb shelter below the bay water as 620 was the original CONELRAD station for the area. The original towers, each located on pilings in Tampa Bay deteriorated with the salt water and sea bird roosting residues and were replaced with new shorter towers on the original pilings in the early 2000s, eliminating the final traces of channel 38 at the 620 kHz transmitting plant.

The station had served as the area&#x27;s original ABC affiliate until WLCY (channel 10, now CBS affiliate WTSP) signed on in 1965, effectively resulting in WSUN becoming an independent station until it went dark in 1970.

==History==
In 1979, four applicants filed with the FCC for channel 38. The winner, decided in 1985, was Bay Television, an entity affiliated with the Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group; the competing applicants included Oak Television of Tampa Bay, a subsidiary of the company behind the ONTV subscription TV service; Home TV, Inc.; and Suncoast 38, a group owned by Clint Murchison. It took years to get the station on the air. In 1987, Sinclair president Bob Simmons was quoted as saying the station would be on the air in late 1988.

WTTA affiliated in September 1990 with the Star Television Network, which offered a mix of older programming and infomercials. That month, there was also an ad for &quot;TV Heaven 38&quot; in the Tampa/Sarasota edition of &quot;TV Guide&quot;; however, Star would enter financial trouble and the network went dark on January 14, 1991. Before going on air, Bay Television also rebuffed an offer from Telemundo to buy the construction permit.

On June 21, 1991, WTTA signed on the air as an independent station consisting mainly of syndicated programs passed over by the market&#x27;s other stations, barter programming, network shows not cleared by WFLA-TV (channel 8), WTSP (channel 10) and WTVT (channel 13) and infomercials. Due to its low budget, weekend programming tended to consist entirely of infomercials. WTTA also presented a televised simulcast of the WRBQ-FM (104.7 FM) weekday morning radio show, the &quot;Q Morning Zoo&quot;, until that station changed formats to country music in 1993. On December 12, 1994, Fox programming moved from WFTS-TV (channel 28) to WTVT as part of a group deal with its then-owners, New World Communications. At the same time, the E. W. Scripps Company (owners of WFTS) cut an affiliation deal with ABC, which resulted in WFTS selling most of its syndicated shows to WTTA. Meanwhile, CBS would move from WTVT to WTSP. Upon the changeover, WTVT chose not to carry the network&#x27;s children&#x27;s program block, Fox Kids, which was picked up by WTTA instead. Channel 38 also picked up some syndicated programs that WFTS had no room for on its schedule due to ABC&#x27;s network-heavy schedule, giving WTTA a stronger programming inventory. Fox Kids later moved to rival WMOR-TV (channel 32), which also carried the successor 4KidsTV block on Sunday mornings until it was discontinued by Fox on December 28, 2008. At one time WTTA was a local broadcast partner of the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey club. They last aired a series of nine Lightning games during the 1999–2000 season.

In September 1999, WTTA became Tampa Bay&#x27;s affiliate of The WB (replacing charter affiliate WMOR, which reverted to being an independent station), two years after the network entered into a group deal with Sinclair to affiliate the company&#x27;s independent stations and UPN affiliates with The WB. The station began using the on-air brand &quot;WB 38&quot;, and ran Kids&#x27; WB during the week until January 2006, when the network discontinued its weekday children&#x27;s block. As a result, Kids&#x27; WB programming on WTTA had been relegated to Saturday mornings as of 2006. In 1999, WTTA&#x27;s operations were taken over by Sinclair after the company entered into a local marketing agreement with Bay Television, which over time had grown become one of the nation&#x27;s largest television station owners. However, Bay Television was effectively a subsidiary of Sinclair; it was owned by Sinclair CEO David Smith, his brothers J. Duncan, Frederick and Robert Smith, and Robert Simmons. Bay Television could also be considered a shell corporation used for the purpose of circumventing Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ownership rules. Normally, this would apply to a duopoly that Sinclair operates, but the Tampa Bay market is one of the few markets where the company does not own or operate more than one television station.

On January 24, 2006, the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner and CBS Corporation (which spun off from Viacom at the end of 2005) announced that the two companies would shut down The WB and UPN and combine the networks&#x27; respective programming to create a new &quot;fifth&quot; network called The CW. UPN (O&amp;O) station WTOG (channel 44) was named as one of the network&#x27;s charter affiliates through an 11-station group deal with owner CBS Corporation (with the inclusion for the pass over from Tribune-owned WB affiliates in Philadelphia, Seattle and Atlanta). On February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of a new &quot;sixth&quot; network called MyNetworkTV, which would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television. Sinclair then announced WTTA would be the market&#x27;s MyNetworkTV affiliate; the station rebranded as &quot;MyTV Tampa Bay&quot; the week before that network&#x27;s September 5, 2006, debut.

On September 3, 2007, channel 38 began airing the controversial &quot;Live Prayer with Bill Keller&quot;. Keller had been bounced from station to station in the Tampa Bay area and landed on WTTA after a sudden departure from WTOG. The show moved to Ion Television owned-and-operated station WXPX-TV (channel 66) in November 2007, after WTTA imposed new restrictions regarding live programming.

On July 19, 2012, concurrently with Sinclair&#x27;s announcement that it would purchase six television stations from Newport Television, Sinclair exercised its option to acquire WTTA outright. The FCC approved the sale on August 27, and it was consummated on December 3.
In September 2013, WTTA rebranded as &quot;Great 38&quot;, the branding it had used for much of the 1990s. It was the second Sinclair-owned or -operated MyNetworkTV affiliate to drop references to the programming from the station&#x27;s on-air branding since Cincinnati&#x27;s WSTR-TV restored its &quot;Star 64&quot; branding in September 2009, and the first entirely not to use the network&#x27;s &quot;blue TV&quot; branding and imaging motif. In conjunction with the rebranding, WTTA began producing several local programs. &quot;Our Issues&quot; is a community affairs program. &quot;Health Matters&quot; is a health and lifestyle program based upon paid content. Both programs are hosted by Jenn Holloway. In April 2014, WTTA and the Tampa Bay Rowdies soccer club announced a marketing and broadcast partnership. Under the deal, the station broadcasts twelve Saturday night Rowdies home games, which are preceded by a half-hour pregame show, &quot;Rowdies Kickoff&quot;. WTTA aired Rowdies home games during the 2014 and 2015 seasons.

On August 20, 2014, Sinclair announced that it would sell WTTA, along with WHTM in Harrisburg (which Sinclair, on behalf of Allbritton is planning on to divest) KXRM-TV and KXTU-LD in Colorado Springs, to Media General in a swap for WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island, WLUK-TV and WCWF in Green Bay, and WTGS in Savannah, Georgia. The swap, part of Media General&#x27;s merger with LIN Media, will make WTTA a sister station to Media General flagship station WFLA-TV. A condition of the sale maintained the station&#x27;s affiliation with Sinclair&#x27;s American Sports Network package of college sports. WHTM&#x27;s sale of Media General was explored nearly two months earlier, and it was completed, nearly three months before the Media General/LIN deal was completed. The sale was completed on December 19.

Shortly after Media General closed on WTTA, its separate Web site was shut down and replaced with a redirect to a separate section of WFLA-TV&#x27;s Web site.

On January 27, 2016, it was announced that the Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion. WFLA and WTTA became part of the newly-minted Nexstar Media Group on January 17, 2017.

As a sister to WFLA-TV, WTTA will air NBC programming at times WFLA-TV cannot do so. Such was the case during Hurricane Irma in 2017, when WTTA carried the &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; Week 1 contest between the New York Giants and Dallas Cowboys while WFLA-TV had hurricane coverage.

In May 2023, CBS News and Stations announced that its CW affiliates, including Tampa station WTOG, would cease their affiliation with the network in September 2023 and become independent stations. Nexstar Media Group announced on June 14, 2023, that WTTA would take over the CW affiliation for the Tampa market on September 1, with MyNetworkTV shifting to the same time slot on the same day to the recently-acquired WSNN-LD (channel 39), though WTTA continues to retain a second run of the lineup as part of its late night schedule.

==Newscasts==
===Sinclair era===
In August 2003, WTTA established a news department and began airing a late evening newscast at 10 p.m. weeknights in an attempt to compete with WTVT&#x27;s longer-established prime time newscast. Known as &quot;WB 38 News at 10&quot;, it was part of Sinclair&#x27;s controversial centralized &quot;News Central&quot; operation and featured a mix of local news and sports stories from staff at WTTA&#x27;s facility, and national and international reports, weather forecasts and sports segments produced out of Sinclair&#x27;s corporate headquarters on Beaver Dam Road in Hunt Valley, Maryland. It also aired &quot;The Point&quot;, a controversial one-minute conservative political commentary feature, that was a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations that aired newscasts (regardless of whether it carried the News Central format or not). Due to poor ratings, WTTA&#x27;s news department was shut down on March 31, 2006, due to cutbacks in Sinclair&#x27;s news operations companywide, which included the disbandment of its News Central division, with the newscast being replaced by syndicated programming.

Newscasts returned to the station on October 8, 2007, after Sinclair and future sister station WFLA-TV entered into a news share agreement resulting in a weeknight prime time newscast produced by that station called &quot;NewsChannel 8 at 10 on My TV Tampa Bay&quot;. Original personnel included news anchors Peter Bernard and Katie Coronado with weather from meteorologists Mace Michaels or Leigh Spann. The broadcast was produced from WFLA&#x27;s studios on South Parker Street in Downtown Tampa. This arrangement was similar to ones established at Sinclair stations in Raleigh, North Carolina, Buffalo, Flint, Michigan, Charleston, South Carolina, and Las Vegas. The WFLA-produced newscast was canceled and ended on April 30, 2009.

===Media General/Nexstar era===

On August 9, 2014, WTTA debuted &quot;Great 38 News Now&quot;, a series of brief weather and news reports, running thirty seconds in length, three times a day. Initially, the news updates, which debuted eleven days before Media General&#x27;s acquisition of WTTA, were produced by former sister station WPEC in West Palm Beach. The program since expanded as a half-hour public affairs show on Sundays at 7 p.m., which was eventually canceled. At the beginning of 2015, production transferred to WFLA-TV, from that station&#x27;s own studios in Tampa.

On January 4, 2016, WFLA once again began producing a local newscast for WTTA, this time, a nightly hour-long newscast at 8 p.m. under the title &quot;NewsChannel 8 at 8:00 on Great 38&quot;, pushing MyNetworkTV programming back one hour. On August 7, 2017, WFLA began producing another local newscast for WTTA, this time, a two-hour expansion of the former&#x27;s morning newscast from 7 to 9 a.m. under the title &quot;NewsChannel 8 Today on Great 38&quot;, with the second hour titled &quot;Make Today Gr8 with Gayle and Leigh&quot;, which is hosted by WFLA morning co-anchor Gayle Guyardo and WFLA morning meteorologist Leigh Spann.

On April 5, 2020, WFLA expanded into Spanish-language news coverage with the addition of a half-hour 9 p.m. newscast airing weeknights entitled &quot;Noticias Tampa Hoy&quot; on WTTA. WFLA also hosts a complementary website which features local news in Spanish.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:

From 2010 to 2012, WTTA and several other Sinclair-owned stations carried TheCoolTV, seen locally on digital subchannel 38.2. On the afternoon of August 31, 2012, TheCoolTV was dropped from the 32 Sinclair stations that carried the network, including WTTA, with no replacement; it would not be until 2015 when WTTA would add another subchannel, Cozi TV.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
On February 2, 2009, Sinclair told cable and satellite television providers via e-mail that regardless of the exact mandatory switchover date to digital-only broadcasting for full-power stations (which Congress rescheduled for June 12 days later), the station would shut down its analog signal on the original transition date of February 17. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 57, which was among the high band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 38. In October 2009, the FCC approved a request by WTTA to relocate its digital signal to UHF channel 32 (the former analog frequency of WMOR-TV) to avoid adjacent channel problems from WFTV in Orlando. WTTA moved its digital signal to channel 32 on August 23, 2010 (the channel 38 allocation is now used for the digital signal of WSPF-CD).

<text>Dunedin ( ; ) is the second-most populous city in the South Island of New Zealand (after Christchurch), and the principal city of the Otago region. Its name comes from (&quot;fort of Edin&quot;), the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. The city has a rich Māori, Scottish, and Chinese heritage.

With an estimated population of as of , Dunedin is New Zealand&#x27;s seventh-most populous metropolitan and urban area. For cultural, geographical, and historical reasons, the city has long been considered one of New Zealand&#x27;s four main centres. The urban area of Dunedin lies on the central-eastern coast of Otago, surrounding the head of Otago Harbour. The harbour and hills around Dunedin are the remnants of an extinct volcano. The city suburbs extend out into the surrounding valleys and hills, onto the isthmus of the Otago Peninsula, and along the shores of the Otago Harbour and the Pacific Ocean.

Archaeological evidence points to lengthy occupation of the area by Māori prior to the arrival of Europeans. The province and region of Otago takes its name from the village of Otakou at the mouth of the harbour, which became a whaling station in the 1830s.

A Scottish settlement was established in 1848 by the Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland and between 1855 and 1900 many thousands of Scots emigrated to the incorporated city. Dunedin&#x27;s population and wealth boomed during the 1860s&#x27; Otago gold rush, and for a brief period of time it became New Zealand&#x27;s largest urban area. The city saw substantial migration from mainland China at the same time, predominately from Guangdong and Guangxi. Dunedin is home to New Zealand&#x27;s oldest Chinese community.

Today, Dunedin has a diverse economy which includes manufacturing, publishing, arts, tourism and technology-based industries. The mainstay of the city&#x27;s economy remains centred around tertiary education, with students from the University of Otago, New Zealand&#x27;s oldest university, and the Otago Polytechnic, accounting for a large proportion of the population; 21.6 per cent of the city&#x27;s population was aged between 15 and 24 at the 2006 census, compared to the New Zealand average of 14.2 per cent. Dunedin is also noted for its vibrant music scene, as the 1980s birthplace of the Dunedin sound (which heavily influenced grunge, indie and modern alternative rock). In 2014, the city was designated as a UNESCO City of Literature.

== History ==
=== Māori settlements ===
Archaeological evidence shows the first human (Māori) occupation of New Zealand occurred between 1250 and 1300 AD, with the population concentrated along the southeast coast. A camp site at Kaikai Beach, near Long Beach to the north of the present-day city of Dunedin, has been dated from about that time. There are numerous archaic (moa-hunter) sites in what is now Dunedin, several of them large and permanently occupied, particularly in the 14th century. The population contracted but expanded again with the evolution of the Classic Māori culture which saw the building of several pā, fortified settlements, notably Pukekura at (Taiaroa Head), about 1650. There was a settlement in what is now central Dunedin (Ōtepoti), occupied as late as about 1785 but abandoned by 1826. There were also Māori settlements at Whareakeake (Murdering Beach), Pūrākaunui, Mapoutahi (Goat Island Peninsula) and Huriawa (Karitane Peninsula) to the north, and at Taieri Mouth and Otokia (Henley) to the south, all inside the present boundaries of Dunedin.

Māori tradition tells first of a people called Kahui Tipua living in the area, then Te Rapuwai, semi-legendary but considered to be historical. The next arrivals were Waitaha, followed by Kāti Māmoe late in the 16th century and then Kāi Tahu (&quot;Ngāi Tahu&quot; in modern standard Māori) who arrived in the mid-17th century. European accounts have often represented these successive influxes as &quot;invasions&quot;, but modern scholarship has cast doubt on that view. They were probably migrations – like those of the Europeans – which incidentally resulted in bloodshed.
The sealer John Boultbee recorded in the late 1820s that the &#x27;Kaika Otargo&#x27; (settlements around and near Otago Harbour) were the oldest and largest in the south.

=== Early arrivals from Europe ===

Lieutenant James Cook stood off what is now the coast of Dunedin between 25 February 1770 and 5 March 1770, naming Cape Saunders (on the Otago Peninsula) and Saddle Hill. He reported penguins and seals in the vicinity, which led Australian, American and British sealers to visit from the beginning of the 19th century. The early years of sealing saw a feud between sealers and local Māori from 1810 to 1823, the &quot;Sealers&#x27; War&quot; sparked by an incident on Otago Harbour. William Tucker became the first European to settle in the area – in 1815.

Permanent European occupation dates from 1831, when the Weller brothers of New South Wales founded their whaling station at Otago (present-day Otakou) on the Otago Harbour. Epidemics severely reduced the Māori population. By the late 1830s, the Harbour had become an international whaling port. Wright &amp; Richards started a whaling station at Karitane in 1837 and Sydney-born Johnny Jones established a farming settlement and a mission station (the South Island&#x27;s first) at Waikouaiti in 1840. The settlements at Karitane and Waikouaiti have endured, making modern Dunedin one of the longest-standing European-settled territories in New Zealand.

Early in 1844, the &quot;Deborah&quot;, captained by Thomas Wing and carrying (among others) his wife Lucy and a representative of the New Zealand Company, Frederick Tuckett, sailed south from Nelson to determine the location of a planned Free Church settlement. After inspecting several areas around the eastern coast of the South Island, Tuckett selected the site which would become known as Dunedin. (Tuckett rejected the site of what would become Christchurch, as he felt the ground around the Avon River / Ōtākaro was swampy.)

The Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland, through a company called the Otago Association, founded Dunedin at the head of Otago Harbour in 1848 as the principal town
of its special settlement.

The name &quot;Dunedin&quot; comes from &quot;Dùn Èideann&quot;, the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland. Charles Kettle the city&#x27;s surveyor, instructed to emulate the characteristics of Edinburgh, produced a striking, &quot;Romantic&quot; town-planning design. There resulted both grand and quirky streets, as the builders struggled and sometimes failed to construct his bold vision across the challenging landscape. Captain William Cargill (1784–1860), a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, served as the secular leader of the new colony. The Reverend Thomas Burns (1796–1871), a nephew of the poet Robert Burns, provided spiritual guidance. By the end of the 1850s, around 12,000 Scots had emigrated to Dunedin, many from the industrial lowlands.

=== Gold rush era ===
In 1852, Dunedin became the capital of the Otago Province, the whole of New Zealand from the Waitaki south. In 1861, the discovery of gold at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully, to the south-west, led to a rapid influx of people and saw Dunedin become New Zealand&#x27;s first city by growth of population in 1865. The new arrivals included many Irish, but also Italians, Lebanese, French, Germans, Jews and Chinese. The Dunedin Southern Cemetery was established in 1858, the Dunedin Northern Cemetery in 1872. In the 1860s, Ross Creek Reservoir was created so as to serve Dunedin&#x27;s need for water.

The London-owned Bank of Otago opened its doors in Dunedin in 1863, opened 12 branches throughout its region, then in 1873 merged with the new National Bank of New Zealand also based in London and also operated from Dunedin but, true to its name, it rapidly expanded throughout New Zealand. Dunedin remained the principal local source of the nation&#x27;s development capital until the Second World War.
Dunedin and the region industrialised and consolidated, and the Main South Line connected the city with Christchurch in 1878 and Invercargill in 1879. Otago Boys&#x27; High School was founded in 1863. The Otago Museum opened in 1868. The University of Otago, the oldest university in New Zealand, in 1869. Otago Girls&#x27; High School was established in 1871.

By 1874, Dunedin and its suburbs had become New Zealand&#x27;s largest city with a population of 29,832 displacing Auckland&#x27;s 27,840 residents to second place.

Between 1881 and 1957, Dunedin was home to cable trams, being both one of the first and last such systems in the world. Early in the 1880s the inauguration of the frozen meat industry, with the first shipment leaving from Port Chalmers in 1882, saw the beginning of a later great national industry. The first successful commercial shipment of frozen meat from New Zealand to the United Kingdom was on the Dunedin in 1881.

After ten years of gold rushes the economy slowed but Julius Vogel&#x27;s immigration and development scheme brought thousands more, especially to Dunedin and Otago, before recession set in again in the 1880s. In these first and second times of prosperity, many institutions and businesses were established, New Zealand&#x27;s first daily newspaper, art school, medical school and public art gallery. The Dunedin Public Art Gallery was among these new foundations. It had been actively promulgated by artist William Mathew Hodgkins. There was also a remarkable architectural flowering producing many substantial and ornamental buildings. R. A. Lawson&#x27;s First Church of Otago and Knox Church are notable examples, as are buildings by Maxwell Bury and F. W. Petre. The other visual arts also flourished under the leadership of W. M. Hodgkins. The city&#x27;s landscape and burgeoning townscape were vividly portrayed by George O&#x27;Brien (1821–1888). From the mid-1890s, the economy revived. Institutions such as the Otago Settlers Museum (now renamed as Toitū Otago Settlers Museum) and the Hocken Collections—the first of their kind in New Zealand—were founded. More notable buildings such as the Railway Station and Olveston were erected. New energy in the visual arts represented by G. P. Nerli culminated in the career of Frances Hodgkins.

=== Early modern era ===

By 1900, Dunedin was no longer the country&#x27;s biggest city. Influence and activity moved north to the other centres (&quot;the drift north&quot;), a trend which continued for much of the following century. Despite this, the university continued to expand, and a student quarter became established. At the same time, people started to notice Dunedin&#x27;s mellowing, the ageing of its grand old buildings, with writers like E. H. McCormick pointing out its atmospheric charm. In 1901 the British royals, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York toured Dunedin.

In the 1930s and early 1940s a new generation of artists such as M. T. (Toss) Woollaston, Doris Lusk, Anne Hamblett, Colin McCahon and Patrick Hayman once again represented the best of the country&#x27;s talent. The Second World War saw the dispersal of these painters, but not before McCahon had met a very youthful poet, James K. Baxter, in a central city studio.
Numerous large companies had been established in Dunedin, many of which became national leaders. Late among them was Fletcher Construction, founded by Sir James Fletcher in the early 20th century. Kempthorne Prosser, established in 1879 in Stafford Street, was the largest fertiliser and drug manufacturer in the country for over 100 years. G. Methven, a metalworking and tap manufacturer based in South Dunedin, was also a leading firm, as was H. E. Shacklock, an iron founder and appliance manufacturer later taken over by the Auckland concern Fisher and Paykel. The Mosgiel Woollens was another Victorian Dunedin foundation. Hallensteins was the colloquial name of a menswear manufacturer and national retail chain, while the DIC and Arthur Barnett were department stores, the former a nationwide concern. Coulls, Somerville Wilkie—later part of the Whitcoulls group—had its origins in Dunedin in the 19th century. There were also the National Mortgage and Agency Company of New Zealand, Wright Stephensons Limited, the Union Steamship Company and the National Insurance Company and the Standard Insurance Company among many others, which survived into the 20th century.

=== Post-war developments ===

After the Second World War prosperity and population growth revived, although Dunedin trailed as the fourth &#x27;main centre&#x27;. A generation reacting against Victorianism started demolishing its buildings and many were lost, notably William Mason&#x27;s Stock exchange in 1969. (Dunedin Stock Exchange building) Although the university continued to expand, the city&#x27;s population contracted, notably from 1976 to 1981. This was a culturally vibrant time with the university&#x27;s new privately endowed arts fellowships bringing writers including James K Baxter, Ralph Hotere, Janet Frame and Hone Tuwhare to the city.
During the 1980s Dunedin&#x27;s popular music scene blossomed, with many acts, such as The Chills, The Clean, The Verlaines and Straitjacket Fits, gaining national and international recognition. The term &quot;The Dunedin sound&quot; was coined to describe the 1960s-influenced, guitar-led music which flourished at the time. Bands and musicians are still playing and recording in many styles.

By 1990, population decline had steadied and slow growth has occurred since and Dunedin re-invented itself as a &#x27;heritage city&#x27; with its main streets refurbished in the Victorian style. R. A. Lawson&#x27;s Municipal Chambers (Dunedin Town Hall) in the Octagon were handsomely restored. The city was also recognised as a centre of excellence in tertiary education and research. The university&#x27;s and polytechnic&#x27;s growth accelerated. Dunedin has continued to refurbish itself, embarking on redevelopments of the art gallery, railway station and the Toitū Otago Settlers Museum. Meanwhile, the continued blossoming of local creative writing saw the city gain UNESCO City of Literature status in 2014. 

Dunedin has flourishing niche industries including engineering, software engineering, biotechnology and fashion. Port Chalmers on the Otago Harbour provides Dunedin with deep-water facilities. It is served by the Port Chalmers Branch, a branch line railway which diverges from the Main South Line and runs from Christchurch by way of Dunedin to Invercargill. Dunedin is also home to MTF, the nationwide vehicle finance company.

The cityscape glitters with gems of Victorian and Edwardian architecture—the legacy of the city&#x27;s gold-rush affluence. Many, including First Church, Otago Boys&#x27; High School and Larnach Castle were designed by one of New Zealand&#x27;s most eminent architects R. A. Lawson. Other prominent buildings include Olveston and the Dunedin Railway Station. Other unusual or memorable buildings or constructions are Baldwin Street, claimed to be the world&#x27;s steepest residential street; the Captain Cook tavern; Cadbury Chocolate Factory (Cadbury World) (In 2018, both the factory and Cadbury World closed to make way for a new NZ$1.4 billion hospital to replace the existing Dunedin Public Hospital); and the Speight&#x27;s brewery.

The thriving tertiary student population has led to a vibrant youth culture (students are referred to as &#x27;Scarfies&#x27; by people who are not students), consisting of the previously mentioned music scene, and more recently a burgeoning boutique fashion industry. A strong visual arts community also exists in Dunedin, notably in Port Chalmers and the other settlements which dot the coast of the Otago Harbour, and also in communities such as Waitati.

Sport is catered for in Dunedin by the floodlit rugby and cricket venues of Forsyth Barr Stadium and University Oval, Dunedin, respectively, the new Caledonian Ground football and athletics stadium near the university at Logan Park, the large Edgar Centre indoor sports centre, the Dunedin Ice Stadium, and numerous golf courses and parks. There is also the Wingatui horseracing course to the south of the city. St Clair Beach is a well-known surfing venue, and the harbour basin is popular with windsurfers and kitesurfers. Dunedin has four public swimming pools: Moana Pool, Port Chalmers Pool, Mosgiel and St Clair Salt Water Pool.

In February 2021, the East Otago towns of Waikouaiti and Karitane in New Zealand reported high lead levels in their water supplies. Local and national authorities responded by dispatching water tanks to assist local residents and providing free blood tests, fruits and vegetables. The lead poisoning scare also attracted coverage by national media. By early March 2021, the Southern District Health Board confirmed that test results indicated that long-term exposure to lead in the water supply posed little risk to the local population.

In late January 2024, the Dunedin City Council and Otago Regional Council released a joint draft strategy to expand housing development and industrial land over the next thirty years to accommodate a projected 10% population growth.

== Geography ==

The Dunedin City territorial authority has a land area of , slightly larger than the American state of Rhode Island or the English county of Cambridgeshire, and a little smaller than Cornwall. It was the largest city in land area in New Zealand until the formation of the Auckland Council on 1 November 2010. The Dunedin City Council boundaries since 1989 have extended to Middlemarch in the west, Waikouaiti in the north, the Pacific Ocean in the east and south-east, and the Waipori/Taieri River and the township of Henley in the south-west.

Dunedin is situated at the head of Otago Harbour, a narrow inlet extending south-westward for some 15 miles. The harbour is a recent creation formed by the flooding of two river valleys. From the time of its foundation in 1848, the city has spread slowly over the low-lying flats and nearby hills and across the isthmus to the slopes of the Otago Peninsula.

=== Geology ===
Eastern Otago is tectonically stable, meaning that it does not experience many earthquakes. One of the few known faults near Dunedin is the Akatore Fault. The first earthquake to cause widespread damage in Dunedin since its founding was the 1974 Dunedin earthquake, which had a magnitude of 4.9 and caused about $3.5 million in damages (2024 terms).

===Inner city===
The central region of Dunedin is known as the Octagon. It was once a gully, filled in the mid-nineteenth century to create the present plaza. The initial settlement of the city took place to the south on the other side of Bell Hill, a large outcrop which had to be reduced to provide easy access between the two parts of the settlement. The central city stretches away from this point in a largely northeast–southwest direction, with the main streets of George Street and Princes Street meeting at The Octagon. Here they are joined by Stuart Street, which runs orthogonally to them, from the Dunedin Railway Station in the southeast, and steeply up to the suburb of Roslyn in the northwest. Many of the city&#x27;s notable old buildings are located in the southern part of this area and on the inner ring of lower hills which surround the central city (most of these hills, such as Maori Hill, Pine Hill, and Maryhill, rise to some above the plain). The head of the harbour includes a large area of reclaimed land (&quot;The Southern Endowment&quot;), much of which is used for light industry and warehousing. A large area of flat land, simply known colloquially as &quot;The Flat&quot; lies to the south and southwest of the city centre, and includes several larger and older suburbs, notably South Dunedin and St Kilda. These are protected from the Pacific Ocean by a long line of dunes which run east–west along the city&#x27;s southern coastline and separate residential areas from Ocean Beach, which is traditionally divided into St. Clair Beach at the western end and St Kilda Beach to the east.


Dunedin is home to Baldwin Street, which, according to the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, is the steepest street in the world. Its gradient is 1 in 2.9. The long-since-abandoned Maryhill Cablecar route had a similar gradient close to its Mornington depot.

Beyond the inner range of hills lie Dunedin&#x27;s outer suburbs, notably to the northwest, beyond Roslyn. This direction contains Taieri Road and Three Mile Hill, which between them formed the original road route to the Taieri Plains. The modern State Highway 1 follows a different route, passing through Caversham in the west and out past Saddle Hill. Lying between Saddle Hill and Caversham are the outer suburbs of Green Island and Abbotsford. Between Green Island and Roslyn lies the steep-sided valley of the Kaikorai Stream, which is today a residential and light industrial area. Suburban settlements—mostly regarded as separate townships—also lie along both edges of the Otago Harbour. Notable among these are Portobello and Macandrew Bay, on the Otago Peninsula coast, and Port Chalmers on the opposite side of the harbour. Port Chalmers provides Dunedin&#x27;s main deep-water port, including the city&#x27;s container port.

The Dunedin skyline is dominated by a ring of (traditionally seven) hills which form the remnants of a volcanic crater. Notable among them are Mount Cargill (), Flagstaff (), Saddle Hill (), Signal Hill (), and Harbour Cone ().

===Hinterland===

Dunedin&#x27;s hinterland encompasses a variety of different landforms. To the southwest lie the Taieri Plains, the broad, fertile lowland floodplains of the Taieri River and its major tributary, the Waipori. These are moderately heavily settled, and contain the towns of Mosgiel, and Allanton. They are separated from the coast by a range of low hills rising to some . Inland from the Taieri Plain is rough hill country. Close to the plain, much of this is forested, notably around Berwick and Lake Mahinerangi, and also around the Silverpeaks Range which lies northwest of the Dunedin urban area. Beyond this, the land becomes drier and opens out into grass and tussock-covered land. A high, broad valley, the Strath-Taieri lies in Dunedin&#x27;s far northwest, containing the town of Middlemarch, one of the area&#x27;s few concentrations of population.

To the north of the city&#x27;s urban area is undulating hill country containing several small, mainly coastal, settlements, including Waitati, Warrington, Seacliff, and Waikouaiti. State Highway 1 winds steeply through a series of hills here, notably The Kilmog. These hills can be considered a coastal extension of the Silverpeaks Range.

===Environment and ecotourism===
To the east of Dunedin lies the entirety of the Otago Peninsula, a long finger of land that formed the southeastern rim of the Dunedin Volcano. The peninsula is lightly settled, almost entirely along the harbour coast, and much of it is maintained as a natural habitat by the Otago Peninsula Trust. The peninsula contains several fine beaches, and is home to a considerable number of rare species, including yellow-eyed and little penguins, seals, and shags. Taiaroa Head, on the peninsula&#x27;s northeastern point, is a site of global ecological significance, as it is home to the world&#x27;s only mainland breeding colony of royal albatross.

Since local council reorganisation in the late 1980s, these are suburbs, but are not commonly regarded as such.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Dunedin in general is temperate. Under the Köppen climate classification, Dunedin features an oceanic climate. This leads to mild summers and coolish winters. Winter is not particularly frosty with around 49 frosts per year, lower than most other South Island locations, but sunny. Snowfall is not particularly common and significant snowfall is uncommon (perhaps every two or three years), except in the inland hill suburbs such as Halfway Bush and Wakari, which tend to receive a few days of snowfall each year. Spring can feature &quot;four seasons in a day&quot; weather, but from November to April it is generally settled and mild. Temperatures during summer can reach . Due to its maritime influence, Dunedin&#x27;s mild summers and mild winters both stand out considering its latitude.

Dunedin has relatively low rainfall in comparison to many of New Zealand&#x27;s cities, with usually only between 600 and recorded per year. However, wet weather is frequent, since much of this rainfall occurs in drizzle or light rain and heavy rain is relatively rare. Dunedin is one of the cloudiest major centres in the country, recording approximately 1,850 hours of bright sunshine per annum. Prevailing wind in the city is mainly a sometimes cool southwesterly and during late spring will alternate with northeasterlies. Warmer, dry northwest winds are also characteristic Foehn winds from the northwest. The circle of hills surrounding the inner city shelters the inner city from much of the prevailing weather, while hills just to the west of the city can often push inclement weather around to the west of the city.

Inland, beyond the heart of the city and into inland Otago, the climate is sub-continental: winters are quite cold and dry, summers warm and dry. Thick freezing ground fogs are common in winter in the upper reaches of the Taieri River&#x27;s course around Middlemarch, and in summer, the temperature occasionally reaches .

==Culture==


===Literature===
In December 2014, Dunedin was designated as a UNESCO Creative City of Literature. Mayor of Dunedin Dave Cull said at the time, &quot;This announcement puts our city on the world map as a first-class literary city. We keep honourable company; other cities bestowed with City of Literature status include Edinburgh, Dublin, Iowa City, Melbourne, Reykjavík, Norwich and Kraków.&quot;

Dunedin&#x27;s application was driven by a steering committee and an advisory board of writers, librarians and academics from a range of Dunedin institutions. The bid highlighted the quality of the city&#x27;s considerable literary heritage, its diverse combination of literary events, businesses, institutions and organisations, plus its thriving community of writers, playwrights and lyricists.

UNESCO established the Creative Cities Network to develop international co-operation among cities and encourage them to drive joint development partnerships in line with UNESCO&#x27;s global priorities of &#x27;culture and development&#x27; and &#x27;sustainable development&#x27;. Each city in the network reflects one of UNESCO&#x27;s seven Creative City themes: folk art, gastronomy, literature, design, film or music. Dunedin is New Zealand&#x27;s first city to be appointed to the Creative City network.

Paul Theroux described Dunedin as &quot;cold and frugal with its shabby streets and mock-gothic university&quot;. The university students he described as &quot;ignorant, assertive and dirty&quot;. Billy Connolly described Dunedin as &quot;a dreary town. It&#x27;s got that Scottish Presbyterian feel about it&quot;. Michael Palin in Full Circle says of Dunedin &quot;at first glance it is a dour, damp, chilly place, its buildings heavy with ponderous Presbyterian pride...but beneath a grey and sober heart there lurks a wild heart.&quot; In 1895, Mark Twain said of the Scottish who settled in Dunedin, &quot;They stopped here on their way from home to heaven – thinking they had arrived&quot;.

===Music===

====Choirs====
Dunedin is home to many choirs. These include the following:
* The 140-member City of Dunedin Choir is Dunedin&#x27;s leading performer of large-scale choral works.
* The Southern Consort of Voices is a smaller choir regularly performing Choral Works.
* The Royal Dunedin Male Choir, conducted by Richard Madden, performs two concerts a year
* The Dunedin RSA Choir regularly performs concerts and has played an important and valued role in Dunedin City&#x27;s commemorative celebrations of significant historical events. ANZAC, of course, is one such occasion, and the ANZAC Revue held on the evening of every ANZAC Day, occupies a special place of honour in the choir&#x27;s calendar.
* The all-female Dunedin Harmony Chorus are an important part of the Dunedin culture.
* The Southern Children&#x27;s Choir, based at Marama Hall in the university, is Dunedin&#x27;s main children&#x27;s choir. Most schools in Dunedin have choirs, many having more than one.
* The Southern Youth Choir is a concert-based youth choir.
* The University of Otago is home to three official choirs: the two chapel choirs (Knox and Selwyn), and the travelling Cantores choir.
* Several Dunedin Churches and Cathedrals hold choirs. Among these are St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Cathedral, home to two choirs: the Cathedral Choir and the Gabrieli Singers; Knox Church&#x27;s large mixed gender choir for adults and children, the Knox Church Choir; All Saints&#x27; Church, Dunedin, has choral scholars from Selwyn College, Otago, St. John&#x27;s Church, Roslyn&#x27;s small mixed-gender parish choir; and St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral&#x27;s mixed-gender adult choir.
* The Dunedin Red Cross Choir (of New Zealand Red Cross), conducted by Eleanor Moyle, is one of only three Red Cross choirs globally. Established in 1942, this choir performs regularly in Dunedin at various Rest Homes and holds an annual concert at the Kings and Queens Performing Arts Centre.

====Instrumental classical and jazz ensembles====
The Dunedin Symphony Orchestra is a semi-professional orchestra based in Dunedin. Other instrumental ensembles include the Rare Byrds early music ensemble, the Collegiate Orchestra, and the Dunedin Youth Orchestra. Many schools also hold school orchestras and bands. There are also three brass bands in Dunedin: St. Kilda Brass, Kaikorai Brass, and Mosgiel Brass. The Otago Symphonic Band and City of Dunedin Pipe Band are also important Dunedin musical ensembles.

====Popular music====
Dunedin lends its name to the Dunedin sound, a form of indie rock music which was created in the city in the 1980s. Some Dunedin bands recorded on the Flying Nun Records label, based in Christchurch. Among the bands with Dunedin connections were The Chills, The Clean, The Verlaines, The Bats, Sneaky Feelings, The Dead C and Straitjacket Fits, all of which had significant followings throughout New Zealand and on the college radio circuit in the United States and Europe.

Dunedin has been home to bands since the end of the Dunedin sound era. Six60, Nadia Reid and Julian Temple Band are Dunedin artists.

The city hosts a large theatre venue, the Regent Theatre in the Octagon. Dunedin hosted the world&#x27;s southernmost professional theatre company, the Fortune Theatre, based in the former Trinity Methodist Church, until it closed in 2018. Smaller theatres in Dunedin include the Globe Theatre, the Mayfair Theatre, the New Athenaeum Theatre, and the Playhouse Theatre.

===Visual arts===
Dunedin has a substantial public art gallery, the Dunedin Public Art Gallery, in the Octagon. The city contains numerous other galleries, including over a dozen dealer galleries, many of which are found south of the Octagon along Princes Street, Moray Place and Dowling Street. There are also several more experimental art spaces, notably the Blue Oyster in Dowling Street.

Many notable artists have strong links with Dunedin, among them Ralph Hotere, Frances Hodgkins, Grahame Sydney, and Jeffrey Harris.

===Marae===
Dunedin has three &quot;marae&quot; (meeting grounds) for Ngāi Tahu, each with its own &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house). Ārai-te-uru marae in Wakari includes the Ārai-te-uru wharenui. Ōtākou Marae in Otakou includes the Tamatea wharenui. Huirapa / Puketeraki marae in Karitāne includes the Huirapa wharenui.

===Honours===
Asteroid 101461 Dunedin discovered by British astronomer Ian P. Griffin in 1998, was named in honour of the city. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 8 November 2019 ().

==Government==
===Local===
The Dunedin City Council (DCC) governs the Dunedin City territorial authority. It is made up of an elected mayor (currently Jules Radich) and fourteen additional councillors elected across three wards, one of whom gets chosen as deputy mayor.

====Coat of arms and flag====

The flag of the city of Dunedin is a banner of arms in white and green and featuring the castle, lymphad, ram&#x27;s head and wheat sheafs as on the coat of arms.

===National===
Dunedin is covered by two general electorates, Dunedin and Taieri, and one Māori electorate, Te Tai Tonga.

The city in general is a stronghold of the New Zealand Labour Party, having won the Dunedin-based electorate seats continuously since the 1978 election. As of the 2023 general election, both general electorates are held by the party, with Rachel Brooking representing Dunedin and Ingrid Leary representing Taieri. Te Tai Tonga (which covers the entire South Island and part of Wellington in the North Island) is held by Te Pāti Māori and represented by Tākuta Ferris. Scott Willis and Mark Patterson are both List MPs from the Taieri electorate.

== Media ==
The major daily newspaper is the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, which is also the country&#x27;s oldest daily newspaper and part of the Allied Press group. Weekly and bi-weekly community newspapers include &quot;The Star&quot;, &quot;Taieri Herald&quot;, the fortnightly street press &quot;POINT&quot;, and the university student magazine &quot;Critic Te Ārohi&quot;.

The city is served by all major national radio and television stations. The city&#x27;s main terrestrial television and FM radio transmitter sits atop Mount Cargill, north of the city, while the city&#x27;s main AM transmitter is located at Highcliff, east of the city centre on the Otago Peninsula. Local radio stations include Radio Dunedin, community station Otago Access Radio (formerly Hills AM, then Toroa Radio), and the university radio station, Radio One.

Television broadcasts began in Dunedin on 31 July 1962 with the launch of channel DNTV2, the last of the four main centres to receive television. In November 1969, DNTV2 was networked with its counterpart stations in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch to form NZBC TV. In 1975, the NZBC was broken up, with the Wellington and Dunedin studios taking over NZBC TV as Television One (now TVNZ 1) while Auckland and Christchurch studios launched Television Two (now TVNZ 2).

The city has one local television station called Channel 39, which is owned by Allied Press. The two major television news broadcasters 1News and Newshub along with Radio New Zealand and NZME also have bureaus in Dunedin. In May 2021, Newshub&#x27;s owner Discovery New Zealand announced that it would be closing down its Dunedin bureau as part of a restructuring process.

The city is home to several prominent media-related production companies, notably Natural History New Zealand and Taylormade Media.

The city was once home to the head offices of Radio Otago—now called RadioWorks (part of Mediaworks) and based in Auckland. It was also formerly the home to several now-defunct newspapers, prominent among which were the &quot;Otago Witness&quot; and the &quot;Evening Star&quot;.

== Education ==


=== Secondary ===
Dunedin is home to 12 secondary schools: eight state and four state-integrated. The oldest secondary school is state-run Otago Boys&#x27; High School, founded in 1863. Its sister school, Otago Girls&#x27; High School (1871) is the oldest state girls&#x27; secondary school in New Zealand, even though it preceded the state education system by six years.

Other state schools include Bayfield High School, Kaikorai Valley College and Logan Park High School. King&#x27;s High School and Queen&#x27;s High School are single-sex schools based in St Clair, and Taieri College in Mosgiel. The four state-integrated schools are Columba College, a Presbyterian girls&#x27; school; St. Hilda&#x27;s Collegiate School, an Anglican girls&#x27; school; John McGlashan College, a Presbyterian boys&#x27; school; and Trinity Catholic College, a Catholic coeducational school.

=== Tertiary ===
* University of Otago
** Dunedin College of Education
* Otago Polytechnic

==Infrastructure and services==
=== Public health and hospitals ===

Dunedin Hospital is the main public hospital in Dunedin. Other hospitals include:
* Mercy Hospital – a private non-profit hospital opened in 1936 and relocated to Maori Hill in 1969
* Wakari Hospital

The Dunedin Hospital and the Wakari Hospital, which are closely related, are operated by Te Whatu Ora. Ambulance services are provided by St John New Zealand.

=== Utilities ===
Aurora Energy owns and operates the electricity distribution network servicing the city and the Taieri plains, while OtagoNet Joint Venture owns and operates the electricity distribution network in the rural areas north and west of the city. Electricity is primarily supplied from Transpower&#x27;s national grid at two substations: Halfway Bush and South Dunedin, with part to the OtagoNet network also supplied from Transpower&#x27;s Naseby substation in central Otago.

== Transport ==
===Road===
The Dunedin urban area is served by two state highways, with an additional two state highways and one tourist route serving other parts of the district. The main state highway in Dunedin is State Highway 1, which runs in a north to south-west direction through the middle of the city, connecting Dunedin with Invercargill to the south and Timaru and Christchurch to the north. Between The Oval and Mosgiel, State Highway 1 follows the eleven-kilometre Dunedin Southern Motorway. State Highway 88 connects central Dunedin to the city&#x27;s port facilities at Port Chalmers.

Other State Highways in the city are: State Highway 86 connecting SH 1 at Allanton with Dunedin International Airport, State Highway 87 connecting SH 1 at Kinmont with SH 85 at Kyeburn via Middlemarch, serving the Dunedin city hinterland.

Dunedin is the northeastern terminus of the Southern Scenic Route, a tourist highway connecting Dunedin to Te Anau via The Catlins, Invercargill and Fiordland.

===Bus===

Buses in Dunedin are organised by the Otago Regional Council. A total of 64 buses operate on 17 weekday routes and 13 weeknight/weekend/holiday routes across the city. Buses are run by two operators, Ritchies Transport with three routes and Go Bus Transport with the remainder. Dunedin City Council-owned operator Citibus was a major player until 2011 when Passenger Transport (New Zealand) purchased Citibus from Dunedin City Holdings, and both companies were subsequently bought by Go Bus.

===Rail===
Dunedin Railway Station, located east of the Octagon, is the city&#x27;s main railway station. Once the nation&#x27;s busiest, the decline in rail over the years saw the withdrawal of most services. Suburban services ceased in 1982, and the last regular commercial passenger train to serve Dunedin, The Southerner, was cancelled in February 2002. The Taieri Gorge Railway now operates tourist-oriented services from the station, the most prominent of which is the Taieri Gorge Limited, which operates daily along the former Otago Central Railway through the scenic Taieri Gorge. Taieri Gorge Railway also operates to Palmerston once weekly. The station is also sometimes visited by excursions organised by other heritage railway societies, and by trains chartered by cruise ships docking at Port Chalmers.

===Air===
Dunedin International Airport is located southwest of the city, on the Taieri Plains at Momona. The airport operates a single terminal and runway, and is the third-busiest airport in the South Island, after Christchurch and Queenstown. It is primarily used for domestic flights, with regular flights to and from Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington and charter flights to and from Queenstown, Wānaka, and Invercargill, but it also has international flights arriving from and departing to Brisbane year round. In recent years, a decline in international passengers can be attributed to fewer international flights operating direct to the airport.

===Sea===
As of 2018, a ferry operates between Port Chalmers and Portobello it started in 2018 and is the first since the early 20th century. Occasional calls have been made to revive them, and a non-profit organisation, Otago Ferries Inc., has been set up to examine the logistics of restoring one of the original ferries and again using it for this route.

In 1866, plans were made for a bridge across the Otago Harbour between Port Chalmers and Portobello, but this grand scheme for an 1140-metre structure never eventuated. Plans were also mooted during the 1870s for a canal between the Pacific coast at Tomahawk and Andersons Bay, close to the head of the harbour. This scheme also never came to fruition.

<text>In Sanskrit texts, Rāja yoga () was both the goal of yoga and a method to attain it. The term also became a modern name for the practice of yoga in the 19th-century when Swami Vivekananda gave his interpretation of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali in his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot;. Since then, Rāja yoga has variously been called [[Ashtanga (eight limbs of yoga)|aṣṭāṅga yoga]], royal yoga, royal union, sahaja marg, and classical yoga.

==Etymology and usage==
Rāja (Sanskrit: राज) means &quot;chief, best of its kind&quot; or &quot;king&quot;. Rāja yoga thus refers to &quot;chief, best of yoga&quot;.

The historical use of the term &quot;Rāja yoga&quot; is found in other contexts, quite different from its modern usage. In ancient and medieval Sanskrit texts, it meant the highest state of yoga practice (one reaching samādhi). The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot;, for example, states that Hatha yoga is one of the ways to achieve Rāja yoga.

Rāja yoga is discussed in the &quot;Yogatattva Upanishad&quot;. It is then mentioned in a 16th-century commentary on a specific step in the &quot;Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali&quot;. The medieval era Tantric work &quot;Dattātreyayogaśāstra&quot; explains in 334 shlokas the principles of four yogas: Mantra yoga, Hatha yoga, Laya yoga and Raja yoga. Alain Daniélou states that &quot;Rāja yoga&quot; was, in the historic literature of Hinduism, one of five known methods of yoga, with the other four being &quot;Hatha yoga&quot;, &quot;Mantra yoga&quot;, &quot;Laya yoga&quot; and &quot;Shiva yoga&quot;. Daniélou translates it as &quot;Royal way to reintegration of Self with Universal Self (Brahman)&quot;.

The term became a modern retronym in the 19th-century when Swami Vivekananda equated raja yoga with the Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali. This meaning is different from that in the &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradīpikā&quot;, a text of the Natha sampradaya.

The method of meditation followed under Sahaj Marg, also called Heartfulness follows Raja Yoga system of practice. This system is in practice formally since 1945 under the name Shri Ram Chandra Mission (SRCM).

The Brahma Kumaris, a new religious movement, teaches a form of meditation it calls &quot;Raja yoga&quot; that has nothing to do with either the precepts of Hatha Yoga or Patañjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot;.

Modern interpretations and literature that discuss &quot;Raja yoga&quot; often credit Patañjali&#x27;s &quot;Yogasūtras&quot; as their textual source, but many neither adopt the teachings nor the philosophical foundations of the Yoga school of Hinduism. This mixing of concepts has led to confusion in understanding historical and modern Indian literature on Yoga.

==History==


===In Shaivism ===

The Shaiva Yoga text, &quot;Amanaska&quot;, dated from the 12th century CE or earlier, is a dialogue between Vamadeva and the deity Shiva. In the second chapter, the text mentions Raja yoga. It states that it is so named because it enables the yogin to reach the illustrious king within oneself, the supreme self. Raja yoga is declared as the goal where one experiences nothing but the bliss of the undisturbed, the natural state of calm, serenity, peace, communion within and contentment.

The Raja yoga goal and state are synonymous with various terms, such as &quot;Amanaska&quot;, &quot;Unmani&quot; and &quot;Sahaj&quot;. The &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; (literally, &quot;A Little Light on Hatha Yoga&quot;) asserts this as follows,

===As a type of yoga===
Some medieval Indian texts on Yoga list Rajayoga as one of many types of yoga. For example, the 17th-century Sarvanga yoga pradipikå, a Braj-bhashya commentary by Sundardas, teaches three tetrads of Yogas. The first group is Bhakti yoga, Mantra yoga, Laya yoga, and Carcha yoga; the second is Hatha yoga, Raja yoga, Laksha yoga, and Ashtanga yoga; the third is Samkhya yoga, Jñana yoga, Brahma yoga, and Advaita yoga. Of the twelve, Sundardas states that Rajayoga is the best yoga.

===As the yoga system of Patanjali===
One meaning of Raja yoga is as a modern retronym introduced by Swami Vivekananda, when he equated raja yoga with the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. After its circulation in the first half of the 1st millennium CE, many Indian scholars reviewed it, then published their &quot;Bhāṣya&quot; (notes and commentary) on it. Together, they form a canon called the &quot;Pātañjalayogaśāstra&quot; (&quot;The Treatise on Yoga of Patañjali&quot;).

According to Axel Michaels, the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; are built upon fragments of texts and traditions from ancient India. According to Feuerstein, the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; are a condensation of two different traditions, namely &quot;eight limb yoga&quot; (ashtanga yoga) and action yoga (&quot;kriya yoga&quot;). The &quot;kriya yoga&quot; part is contained in chapter 1, chapter 2 verse 1-27, chapter 3 except verse 54, and chapter 4. The &quot;eight limb yoga&quot; is described in chapter 2 verse 28-55, and chapter 3 verse 3 and 54.

There are numerous parallels in the ancient Samkhya, Yoga and Abhidharma schools of thought, particularly from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century AD, notes Larson. Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras may be a synthesis of these three traditions. From the Samkhya school of Hinduism, Yoga Sutras adopt the &quot;reflective discernment&quot; (&quot;adhyavasaya&quot;) of &quot;prakrti&quot; and &quot;purusa&quot; (dualism), its metaphysical rationalism, and its three epistemic methods to gaining reliable knowledge. From Abhidharma Buddhism&#x27;s idea of &quot;nirodhasamadhi&quot;, suggests Larson, Yoga Sutras adopt the pursuit of an altered state of awareness. However, unlike Buddhism, which believes that there is neither self nor soul, Yoga is physicalist and realist, like Samkhya, in believing that each individual has a self and soul. The third concept that Yoga Sutras synthesizes into its philosophy is the ancient ascetic traditions of isolation, meditation and introspection, as well as the yoga ideas from the 1st millennium BCE Indian texts such as Katha Upanishad, Shvetashvatara Upanishad and Maitri Upanishad.

===Islamic period===
In early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni visited India, lived among Hindus for 16 years, and with their help translated several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian. One was Patanjali&#x27;s Yogasutras. Along with generally accurate translations, Al Biruni&#x27;s text has significant differences from Yogasutra manuscripts discovered in India during the 19th century. Al Biruni&#x27;s record has helped modern scholars establish that Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yogasutras&quot; manuscript existed in India in many versions, each with multiple commentaries by Hindu scholars. Some of these versions and commentaries are either lost or undiscovered. Al Biruni&#x27;s translation preserved many of the core themes of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism; however, certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated, making them more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni&#x27;s version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD.

In Indian historical timeline, marking with the arrival of Islam in India in twelfth century, further development and literature on Yoga philosophy of Hinduism went into decline. By the sixteenth century, Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga philosophy was nearly extinct. Yoga was preserved by sadhus (ascetics, sannyasis) of India. Some of the Hindu yoga elements were adopted by Sufi sect of Muslims in India. The Sufi Muslims at times adopted and protected the Yoga tradition of Hindus during the Islamic rule of India, and at other times helped the persecution and violence against those Hindus. The Mughal Emperor Akbar, known for his syncretic tolerance, was attracted to and patronized Yoga philosophy of Hinduism.

==Comparison with Buddhism==

The yoga scholar Stephen Cope identifies the following similarities between Rāja yoga and Buddhism. He notes that the two philosophies are not the same, but are strikingly similar, having shared a long period of interchange up to about 500 CE.

<text>The pound, or lira (, plural , and , , from the Latin via the Italian ; sign: £, sometimes £C for distinction), was the currency of Cyprus, including the Sovereign Base Areas in Akrotiri and Dhekelia, from 1879 to 2007, when the Republic of Cyprus adopted the euro. However, the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus uses the Turkish lira as its official currency.

The Cypriot pound was introduced in 1879 and was equal in value to one pound sterling. It remained at that value until 1972, some twelve years after Cyprus gained independence from the United Kingdom. The Cypriot pound was replaced by the euro as official currency of the Republic of Cyprus on 1 January 2008 at the irrevocable fixed exchange rate of £C 0.585274 = €1.00.

==History==

The British introduced the Cypriot pound in 1879. It had the same value as the pound sterling, and replaced Turkish currency at a rate of £C 1 to 180 piastres. The Cypriot pound was initially divided into 20 &quot;shillings&quot; ( / , , ), in common with sterling. However, unlike the British shilling, the Cypriot shilling was divided into 9 &quot;piastres&quot; ( / , , , abbreviated &quot;cp&quot;. or &quot;p&quot;.), thus establishing a nomenclature link to earlier Ottoman currency. The piastre was itself divided into 40 &quot;para&quot; (like the ). The para denomination did not appear on any coins or banknotes but was used on postage stamps. However, the -piastre coin was equal to 10 para () and called in Greek and the -piastre coin was equal to 20 para and called . The Cypriot pound remained equal in value to sterling until 1972, some twelve years after Cyprus gained independence from the United Kingdom.

The introduction of the Cypriot pound was controversial from its inception in 1879 as the island was technically a province of the Ottoman Empire and the right to issue currency within the Ottoman Empire rested solely with the Ottoman Sultan. A question on the legality of introducing the pound in Cyprus was raised by the British Member of Parliament, Thomson Hankey, in the United Kingdom parliament in 1879, but concerns were dismissed by the British government. This concern was rendered moot on the island following the annexation of Cyprus by Britain in 1914, in response to the Ottomans siding with the Central Powers in the First World War.

The British takeover of Cyprus in 1914 was not ratified by the Republic of Turkey until the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, but that agreement led to the creation of a full British colonial government in Cyprus in 1926, with the establishment of a local legislative council. The Council in turn established a Cyprus Currency Board in 1927 to oversee the issue of Cypriot currency.

The Currency Board could issue notes and coins, initially denominated in pounds, shillings and piastres, and later, following decimalization in 1955, in pounds and mils. However, the Cypriot pound remained pegged at par with sterling, meaning ultimate fiscal control still rested with the Bank of England and the British government. This link was maintained by the requirement that for every pound issued by the Currency Board in Cyprus, one pound sterling issued by the Bank of England had to be deposited by the Government of Cyprus with the Crown Agents in London.

===Decimalisation===
In 1955, the British colonial authorities decimalised the Cypriot pound, using the &quot;pound and mil&quot; system proposed in 1855 by Sir William Brown MP, where the pound is divided into 1,000 parts, each called a mil (rather than 960 farthings). Although this system was never adopted in the United Kingdom, it was used in several British colonies, including Hong Kong from 1863 to 1866, and the British Mandate of Palestine from 1927 until 1948. This latter example may have been the impetus to use a pound-mil system in Cyprus as the Palestine pound was for a brief period accepted as legal tender in Cyprus.

The Cypriot pound was decimalised in 1955 at 1,000 &quot;mils&quot; (, ) to the pound. Colloquially, the 5 mil coin was known as a &quot;piastre&quot; (not an exact equivalence; the piastre was equal to mils) and the 50 mil coin as a &quot;shilling&quot; (an exact equivalence).

The subdivision was changed to 100 &quot;cents&quot; (, ) to the pound on 3 October 1983. At that time, the smallest coin still in circulation was that of 5 mils. This was renamed as c, but soon was abolished. Mil-denominated coins are no longer legal tender.

Towards the end of the Cypriot pound&#x27;s circulation, some cashiers omitted the 1c and 2c coins from the change they gave. Owner-operated businesses often rounded down the net amount to be paid to the nearest multiple of 5c.

===Towards the euro===

The Cypriot pound was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2008. The currency entered the Exchange Rate Mechanism II on 2 May 2005 and it was limited within the band of £C 0.585274 ±15% per euro. A formal application to adopt the euro was submitted on 13 February 2007. On May 16, 2007, Cyprus, along with Malta, received the European Commission&#x27;s approval for this and was confirmed by the European Parliament on 20 June 2007 and the EU leaders on 21 June 2007. The permanent exchange rate, €1.00 = £C 0.585274, was decided by the EU Finance Ministers on 10 July 2007. From 12 July 2007 to 5 December 2007, the exchange rate remained at £ C0.5842. Since 7 December 2007, the rate has been fixed at the irrevocable rate, €1 = £C 0.585274.

In summer 2006, the Bank of Cyprus started including on its statements the indicative balance in euros. The Cyprus Telecommunications Authority followed suit with its bills two months later. A small number of shops also showed indicative euro totals on their receipts. By late autumn 2006, the number of banks and shops offering indicative euro equivalents on their statements and pricing had increased significantly.

===Euro changeover===
The Cypriot pound was replaced by the euro as official currency of the Republic of Cyprus on 1 January 2008 at the irrevocable fixed exchange rate of £C 0.585274 = €1. However, pound banknotes and coins continued to have legal tender status and were accepted for cash payments until 31 January 2008. Cypriot pounds were convertible free of charge at Cypriot credit institutions until 30 June 2008. Cypriot pound coins were convertible at the Central Bank of Cyprus until 31 December 2009 and banknotes were convertible until 31 December 2017.

==Coins==

===Predecimal===

In 1879, copper coins were introduced in denominations of , , and 1 piastre (&quot;p&quot;.). The Greek-Cypriots called the first of these coins the δεκάρα (&quot;dekara&quot;—from the Greek word &quot;deka&quot; that means ten), referring to its equivalence to 10 para. The Greek name for the &quot;p&quot;. coin was εικοσάρα (&quot;ikosara&quot;—from the Greek &quot;ikosi&quot; that means twenty). These coins were followed, in 1901, by silver 3&quot;p&quot;., &quot;p&quot;., 9&quot;p&quot;. and 18&quot;p&quot;., the last two being equal to 1 and 2 shillings, as the word &quot;shilling&quot; appeared only on banknotes and was not used on any coins until 1947. The 3&quot;p&quot;. was only issued that year. The pt was last struck in 1926. In 1934, scalloped-shaped &quot;p&quot;. and 1&quot;p&quot;. coins were introduced struck in cupro-nickel, changing to bronze in 1942. In 1947, cupro-nickel 1/– and 2/– replaced the silver coins. The last piastre and shilling coins were issued in 1949.

===Decimal - mils===

In 1955, 3, 5, 25, 50, and 100 mil coins were introduced, with the lowest two struck in bronze and the others in cupro-nickel. In 1963, dodecagonal, aluminium 1 mil coins were introduced, following the discontinuation of the 3 mil coin. Dodecagonal, aluminium 5 mil coins were introduced in 1981.

===Decimal - cents===

In 1983, coins were introduced for c, 1c, 2c, 5c, 10c and 20c, with the c the same size and composition as the earlier 5 mil coins. The other coins were struck in nickel-brass. The c was only struck in 1983. In 1991, cupronickel, Reuleaux heptagonal (curved-equilateral-heptagonal) 50c coins were introduced.

==Banknotes==

===Predecimal===

In 1914, the government issued emergency notes in denominations of 10/–, and £1 and £5. Regular type notes were issued from 1917 and on. Notes for 5/– and 10/–, and £1 and £10 were introduced that year, followed by 1/- and 2/– shillings in 1920 and £5 in 1926. Denominations below 10/– were not issued after 1920 but were reintroduced in 1939, with 3&quot;p&quot;. notes issued between 1943 and 1944. The 1/– and 2/– notes were replaced by new coins in 1947.

===Decimal - mils===

In 1955, the 5/– and 10/– notes were replaced by 250 mil and 500 mil notes. The Central Bank of Cyprus was established in 1963 as an autonomous institution in accordance with the Central Bank of Cyprus Law 1963 and the relevant articles of the constitution. It began issuing paper money in 1964, and introduced £10 notes in 1977. Notes for 250 mils ceased production in 1982, shortly before the cent was introduced.

===Decimal - cents===
On 3 October 1983, 50c notes replaced the 500 mil notes (though using the same basic design), with £20 notes added in 1992.

The 1992/1993 version of the £20 note was almost identical to the latest one in terms of design. However, it is often considered part of the 1987–1992 series despite the apparent look and feel difference. And like the rest of the 1987–1992 series, the 1992/1993 £20 note was officially withdrawn by the Central Bank a few years before the adoption of the euro.

<doc id="628350" wikidata="Q7950608" url="?curid=628350" title="WICS">
<text>WICS (channel 20) is a television station licensed to Springfield, Illinois, United States, affiliated with ABC. The station is owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, and maintains studios on East Cook Street in Springfield&#x27;s Eastside; its transmitter is located west of Mechanicsburg, in unincorporated Sangamon County.

[[WICD (TV)|WICD]] (channel 15) in Champaign–Urbana operates as a semi-satellite of WICS. As such, it simulcasts all network and syndicated programming as provided through WICS, and the two stations share a website. However, WICD airs separate commercial inserts and legal identifications. Local newscasts, produced by WICS, are simulcast on both stations. WICS serves the western half of the Central Illinois market while WICD serves the eastern portion. The two stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Although WICD maintains its own studios on South Country Fair Drive in downtown Champaign, master control and most internal operations are based at WICS&#x27; facilities.

Through joint sales and shared services agreements (JSA/SSA), Sinclair also provides certain services to the area&#x27;s Fox affiliate, Springfield-licensed WRSP-TV, channel 55 (and its semi-satellite, Urbana-licensed WCCU, channel 27), as well as Decatur-licensed CW outlet WBUI, channel 23 (all are owned by GOCOM Media, LLC). WRSP and WBUI share studios with WICS but WBUI also maintains an advertising sales office on South Main Street/US 51 in downtown Decatur. WCCU&#x27;s advertising sales operation is also based out of WICD&#x27;s studios.

==History==
WICS began operations on September 17, 1953, and was owned by Plains Television Partners of Springfield, which was a 50/50 joint venture of Transcontinental Properties and the H &amp; E Balaban Corporation. It carried programming from all four networks of the era (NBC, CBS, ABC, and DuMont). However, it was a primary NBC affiliate. Although the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had collapsed most of East Central Illinois into one giant television market, WICS took on a secondary CBS affiliation because its primary affiliate, WCIA in Champaign, only provided a marginal signal to Springfield. It also aired whatever ABC programs WTVP in Decatur (now WAND) had to turn down in order to air CBS shows not cleared by WCIA.

By 1958, WICS was an exclusive NBC affiliate. The station originally had facilities at the Leland Hotel on Capitol Street in Downtown Springfield. In 1964, it moved to its current studios on East Cook Street in East Springfield. The FCC considered making East Central Illinois an all-UHF market but dropped these plans under heavy lobbying from WCIA.

However, WICS&#x27; signal was not nearly strong enough to reach the eastern portion of the area. At the time, UHF signals were not strong enough to cover large amounts of territory. Accordingly in 1959, Plains Television signed-on WCHU in Champaign as a low-power satellite of WICS. In 1960, it bought WDAN-TV (another low-power station in Danville) and changed the calls to WICD. At the same time, WCHU began breaking off from the WICS signal to air some local programming for the eastern side of the market, which was simulcast on WICD. In 1967, Plains Television merged WCHU and WICD into a new full-power station on UHF channel 15 under the WICD calls, but operating under the WCHU license.

Plains Television sold WICS to Guy Gannett Communications (no relation to the larger Gannett Company), in 1986 but held onto WICD until 1994. The two stations operated as a regional network sharing most network and syndicated programming. This arrangement nearly brought down WICD, and for a time, it appeared the station would revert to a full-time satellite of WICS. Guy Gannett finally bought WICD in 1994.
Sinclair purchased most of Guy Gannett&#x27;s stations, including WICS and WICD, in 1999. The company almost immediately turned around and announced it was selling the two (which count as one for regulatory purposes) plus KGAN in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to Sunrise Television. However, the FCC did not allow Sunrise to buy WICS/WICD due to Sunrise&#x27;s ownership structure. Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst (HMTF), an investment firm controlled by then-Texas Rangers and Dallas Stars owner Tom Hicks, owned a large block of Sunrise stock. HMTF was majority stockholder of the LIN TV Corporation, then-owner of WAND. The FCC ruled HMTF held enough stock in Sunrise that if it bought WICS/WICD, it would have created a duopoly between two of the four highest-rated stations in the market, which is forbidden by FCC rules. With the eventual relaxation of ownership limits, Sinclair soon took the stations off the market and retained them.

On September 5, 2005, the two stations swapped affiliations with WAND and became ABC affiliates as part of a larger national deal between LIN and NBC that also involved WDTN in Dayton, Ohio (who swapped affiliations with WICS/WICD&#x27;s Dayton sister station WKEF the year before). WICS/WICD was to have switched to ABC at the beginning of the 2004–05 television season, but it was required to remain with NBC for another year, as its affiliation contract with the station did not expire until September 4 of the following year. On November 17, 2010, WICS became available to Dish Network customers in Terre Haute, Indiana, as the ABC affiliate since the market lacked an affiliate of its own. WICD&#x27;s transmitter is near the border between Illinois and Indiana, and WICD was carried on most cable systems on the Illinois side of the Terre Haute market. However, WICS was the only station uplinked by satellite providers due to contractual obligations, since it was considered the main station. WICS disappeared from the Terre Haute local feed in the fall of 2011 after that city&#x27;s Fox affiliate, WFXW, rejoined ABC as WAWV-TV.

On December 31, 2012, the Sinclair Broadcast Group closed on the purchase of the non-license assets of GOCOM&#x27;s three television stations, WRSP/WCCU and sister station WBUI for approximately $25.6 million. Sinclair is providing sales and other non-programming services to the stations pursuant to shared services and joint sales agreements. Both WRSP/WCCU and WBUI were initially operated from separate facilities from WICS/WICD. However, WCCU quickly moved its advertising sales operation from its location on South Neil Street/U.S. 45 in Champaign into WICD&#x27;s studios. Eventually, WRSP and WBUI also moved from their offices on Old Rochester Road in Springfield and were consolidated into WICS&#x27; facility.

==News operation==
Along with several other Sinclair properties, WICS/WICD did not participate in the wider implementation of the company&#x27;s now-defunct, controversial &quot;News Central&quot; format for their newscasts. This format saw local news operations reduced at some stations and combined with national news coverage, weather forecasting, and sports headlines based out of Sinclair&#x27;s headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland. WICS/WICD, however, did air &quot;The Point&quot; (a one-minute conservative political commentary) that was also controversial and a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations with newscasts until the series was discontinued in December 2006.

On September 11, 2006, a news share agreement was established with WRSP/WCCU (then separately controlled). As a result, a nightly prime time newscast began airing on those two stations that was jointly produced by WICS/WICD. Known as &quot;NewsChannel at 9 on Fox Illinois&quot;, it aired for a half-hour from a modified set at WICS&#x27; Springfield studios featuring unique duratrans indicating the Fox-branded show. From the start, &quot;NewsChannel at 9&quot; competed with a newscast already established in the time slot on then-UPN affiliate WCFN (produced by WCIA). Unlike the WRSP/WCCU show, WCFN&#x27;s broadcast originated from WCIA&#x27;s Champaign facilities but was targeted specifically at a Springfield audience. Although the WRSP/WCCU newscast features market wide coverage, including contributions from WICD reporters based in Champaign, there is a separate weeknight weather segment for WRSP and WCCU that was seen. WCFN&#x27;s prime time broadcast would be eventually canceled by WCIA on September 28, 2009. On October 7, 2013, the weekday edition of &quot;NewsChannel at 9&quot; was expanded to an hour.

The effort on WRSP/WCCU was further expanded on January 20, 2014, when WICS began producing a two-hour weekday morning show for the Fox affiliates. Known as &quot;Good Day Illinois&quot;, the program can be seen from 7 to 9 a.m. and offers a local alternative to the national morning programs seen on the big three networks. It also competes with another two-hour local newscast seen at same time on MyNetworkTV affiliate WCIX (produced by WCIA). On June 26, 2010, rival WAND became the first television station in East-Central Illinois to upgrade news production to high definition level. It was not until December 2012 that local newscasts seen on WICS were upgraded to HD. Included with the change was a new set at the Springfield studios and updated Sinclair corporate graphics. Until October 13, 2014, WICD&#x27;s separate weekday newscasts at its Champaign studios were not included in the upgrade because that set lacked high definition cameras.

On March 26, 2011, WICD ceased airing its own newscasts on weekends opting to simulcast those from WICS. These broadcasts are known as &quot;ABC NewsChannel&quot; and feature a common graphics package seen on WICS and WICD. Multimedia journalists based at WICD&#x27;s Champaign studios still provide coverage of the eastern areas of the market. The change represented the second attempt at a joint market-wide product by WICS/WICD. At one point in time, there had been a newscast weeknights at 5 that was simulcast on both outlets originating from Springfield.

On March 13, 2015, Sinclair announced that WICD would stop offering separate newscasts on weekdays that focus on the eastern areas of the market (Champaign–Urbana–Danville). This change took effect after the final WICD-produced newscast aired on April 3. In its place are newscasts simulcast from WICS (in all time slots) which provide market-wide coverage including content from the eastern areas through a downsized bureau at WICD&#x27;s studios. On April 7, 2015, despite this significant reduction, WICD began airing a full sixty-minute Champaign-based prime time newscast (weeknights at 9) on WCCU entitled &quot;Fox Champaign News at Nine&quot;.

The existing hour-long WICS-produced newscast on WRSP, which had been simulcast on WCCU, was refocused to Springfield and became known as &quot;Fox News at Nine&quot;. The weekend edition of the prime time news will continue to be a market-wide simulcast on WRSP and WCCU. With the exception of the WCCU newscast, WICD no longer produces Champaign-specific local news. While WICS and WICD operated separate news departments, there was a considerable amount of resource sharing between the two outlets, such as with video footage and personnel. This was particularly the case when covering Decatur (located between Springfield and Champaign).

In June 2019, Sinclair fired Joe Crain, a weekday morning meteorologist who had been with WICS since 2006, for speaking out on-air – during the June 5 edition of &quot;NewsChannel 20 Sunrise&quot; – against a group mandate to Sinclair&#x27;s news-producing stations to denote threats of severe thunderstorm activity through &quot;Code Red&quot; alerts, regardless of the severity of the event being forecast, stating that the system was &quot;created by, likely, a journalism school graduate&quot;, rather than a professional meteorologist. (The initiative, which Sinclair began implementing in 2018 and is similar to systems devised by other groups such as Gray Television through the stations it inherited from the now-defunct Raycom Media, is known by different names depending on the station, such as &quot;Weather Warn&quot; or as a &quot;(weather branding) Alert Day&quot;.) Critics of the initiative stated that the &quot;Code Red&quot; days unnecessarily alarm Central Illinois-area residents and harms local business revenue on the designated days.

Despite complaints and comments from viewers on the station&#x27;s social media platforms, letters to the editor and local talk radio shows, Sinclair continued to mandate its meteorologists to use the terminology. The station&#x27;s social media page was flooded with comments from viewers demanding the reinstatement of Joe Crain, pushing the hashtag #IStandWithJoeCrain, while U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) stating that the &quot;Code Red&quot; system &quot;overstat[es] the danger to our community&quot;. Despite this, by June 11, Sinclair posted an advertisement on its website seeking a replacement for Crain as meteorologist for WICD/WICS and WRSP/WCCU&#x27;s morning newscasts. On June 13, a spokesman for Sinclair stated that he had been, in fact, let go. This is not the first time the station has taken issue with talent popular with their viewers; in 2015, chief meteorologist Ric Kearbey was unable to reach a deal with WICS on a new contract, while anchor Liz Foster resigned to take a new position in Charlotte, North Carolina.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WICS shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 20, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 42, using virtual channel 20.

<text>WICD (channel 15) is a television station licensed to Champaign, Illinois, United States, affiliated with ABC. Owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, the station has studios on South Country Fair Drive in Champaign, and its transmitter is located northeast of Homer, along the Vermilion–Champaign county line.

Although identifying as a separate station in its own right, WICD is considered a semi-satellite of WICS (channel 20) in Springfield–Decatur. As such, it simulcasts all network and syndicated programming as provided through its parent, and the two stations share a website. However, WICD airs separate commercial inserts and legal identifications. Local newscasts, produced by WICS, are simulcast on both stations. WICD serves the eastern half of the Central Illinois market while WICS serves the western portion. The two stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Although WICD maintains its own facilities, master control and most internal operations are based at WICS&#x27; studios on East Cook Street in Springfield&#x27;s Eastside section.

Through joint sales and shared services agreements (JSA/SSA), Sinclair also provides certain services to the area&#x27;s Fox affiliate, Springfield-licensed WRSP-TV, channel 55 (and its semi-satellite, Urbana-licensed WCCU, channel 27) as well as Decatur-licensed CW outlet WBUI, channel 23 (all are owned by GOCOM Media, LLC). WRSP and WBUI share studios with WICS but WBUI also maintains an advertising sales office on South Main Street/US 51 in downtown Decatur. WCCU&#x27;s advertising sales operation is also based out of WICD&#x27;s studios.

==History==
The station signed on April 23, 1959, as WCHU (for Champaign–Urbana). It was an NBC affiliate and aired an analog signal on UHF channel 33. It was owned by Plains Television Partners and was a low-power, full-time satellite of Springfield&#x27;s WICS. The WCHU signal traveled about from a transmitter at its studios atop the Inman Hotel in Downtown Champaign. However, getting a decent signal from Springfield ( west of Champaign) was usually hit-or-miss at best. Plains Television had to build a microwave tower in Northwestern Champaign to send the WICS signal to the WCHU studios. With a more reliable signal, the station began a more routine schedule on September 14. It began broadcasting in color the next year.

In July 1960, Plains Television Partners bought WDAN-TV in Danville. That station had debuted on December 19, 1953, as a low-powered ABC affiliate broadcasting on channel 24 with a signal radiating about from its transmitter. WDAN was owned by the Gannett Company along with the &quot;Danville Commercial-News&quot; newspaper and WDAN radio (1490 AM). After the sale, Plains Television changed WDAN-TV&#x27;s call letters to WICD (for &quot;WICS Danville&quot;; Federal Communications Commission [FCC] regulations at the time required separately-owned stations to use different call signs, and the &quot;Commercial-News&quot; retained WDAN radio) and made it a full repeater of WCHU. From 1960 until 1967, WCHU/WICD aired some locally originated programs from the WCHU studios in Champaign. However, WICD&#x27;s transmitter was not capable of broadcasting local programming in color.

In June 1966, Plains Television announced WCHU and WICD would merge into a single full-power station broadcasting on channel 15. It would operate under WCHU&#x27;s license and studios at the Inman Hotel in Champaign, but use the WICD call letters—whose meaning was now altered to mean &quot;WICS Champaign–Danville&quot;. The new station would broadcast at a million watts from the tallest tower in Illinois, at . The new station was to have gone on-air in January 1967, but an ice storm toppled the tower. It was eventually rebuilt and the new WICD went on-air in July. However, there are unconfirmed reports of a delay in the final paperwork for the revamped station. According to some reports, it may have still been using the WCHU call letters when it signed on at full power for the first time. The station moved from the Inman Hotel to its current studio facility on Country Fair Drive in 1978.

In 1986, Plains Television sold WICS to Guy Gannett Broadcasting (no relation to the much larger Gannett Company), but retained WICD. The two stations operated as a regional network simulcasting most network and syndicated programming. This arrangement nearly brought down WICD, even though it was a very prosperous period for NBC as a whole. For much of the 1980s it looked like channel 15 would revert to being a full-time satellite of WICS. In 1994, Plains Television sold WICD to Guy Gannett, who pumped significant resources into the station, particularly its news department.

Guy Gannett then sold most of its television properties, including WICD/WICS, to the Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1999. Soon after Sinclair took over, it turned around and announced it was selling WICS/WICD as well as KGAN in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to Sunrise Television. However, the FCC did not allow Sunrise to buy WICD/WICS due to Sunrise&#x27;s ownership structure. Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst (HMTF), an investment firm controlled by then-Texas Rangers and Dallas Stars owner Tom Hicks, owned a large block of Sunrise stock. HMTF is majority stockholder of the LIN TV Corporation, then-owner of WAND in Decatur. The FCC ruled HMTF held enough stock in Sunrise that an acquisition of WICD/WICS would result in a duopoly between two of the four highest-rated stations in the market, which is forbidden by FCC rules. Sinclair subsequently withdrew the offer to sell the three stations in 2000. The station&#x27;s 46-year affiliation with NBC ended on September 5, 2005, when, as part of a larger national deal between LIN TV and NBC that also involved WDTN in Dayton, Ohio (who swapped affiliations with WICS/WICD&#x27;s Dayton sister station WKEF the year before), WICD and WICS swapped affiliations with WAND and became ABC affiliates.

With this switch, WICD replaced WAND as the default ABC affiliate for the Illinois side of the Terre Haute, Indiana, market, which had not had an ABC affiliate of its own since longtime affiliate WBAK-TV switched to Fox in 1995. The network swap actually improved reception for ABC programming on the Illinois side of the market. WICD&#x27;s transmitter is not far from the Indiana line, while WAND&#x27;s transmitter in Argenta is near the middle of the state. Due to contracts with satellite providers, for a long time WICS was the only ABC station in the market uplinked on the Champaign–Springfield–Decatur local feeds. However, Dish Network&#x27;s Champaign–Springfield–Decatur feed began airing WICD on February 23, 2013, alongside WICS. For the same reason, when Dish dropped WRTV from Indianapolis as the local ABC affiliate for the Terre Haute feed, it uplinked WICS rather than WICD. This ended at the start of the 2011–12 television season, when WAWV-TV rejoined ABC.

In March 2011, WICD added music video channel TheCoolTV to its second digital subchannel and Comcast digital channel 807. On August 31, 2012, TheCoolTV was dropped from all Sinclair stations, including WICD. On December 31, 2012, Sinclair Broadcast Group closed on the purchase of the non-license assets of GOCOM&#x27;s three television stations, WRSP/WCCU and sister station WBUI for approximately $25.6 million. Sinclair is providing sales and other non-programming services to the stations pursuant to shared services and joint sales agreements. Both WRSP/WCCU and WBUI were initially operated from separate facilities from WICS/WICD. However, WCCU quickly moved its advertising sales operation from its location on South Neil Street/U.S. 45 in Champaign into WICD&#x27;s studios. Eventually, WRSP and WBUI also moved from their offices on Old Rochester Road in Springfield and were consolidated into WICS&#x27; facility.

==News operation==

For its first half-century on the air, WICD operated a separate news department, airing a full schedule of newscasts. In later years, there was a considerable amount of resource sharing between the two outlets such as with video footage and personnel. This was particularly the case when covering Decatur (which is located between each of the station&#x27;s studios). WICS had a slightly larger news department than WICD. Several on-air personnel at WICD performed &quot;one-man-band&quot; multimedia journalism duties such as shooting video, editing coverage, and producing. At one point, WICD also operated a Vermilion County Bureau on North Washington Street in Danville (home to WDAN (1490 AM), WDNL (102.1 FM), and WRHK (94.9 FM)).

Lately, WICS/WICD have been very competitive in the local news race after years of being a distant second behind longtime dominant WCIA. Beginning with the November 2006 Nielsen ratings period, the two actually briefly led with viewership in East-Central Illinois. This is because the station&#x27;s ratings are combined by Nielsen Media Research and considers WICS and WICD to be a single station for counting purposes. The latter is identified as &quot;WICS+&quot; in ratings books and has continued battling WCIA for the top spot splitting the position over various time slots. Basically, WICD&#x27;s existence benefits WICS even though the satellite is technically combined with the primary station.

Along with several other Sinclair properties, WICS/WICD did not participate in the wider implementation of the company&#x27;s now-defunct, controversial &quot;News Central&quot; format for their newscasts. This operations saw local news operations reduced at some stations and combined with national news coverage, weather forecasting, and sports headlines based out of Sinclair&#x27;s headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland. WICS/WICD, however, did air &quot;The Point&quot; (a one-minute conservative political commentary), that was also controversial and a requirement of all Sinclair-owned stations with newscasts until the series was discontinued in December 2006.

On September 11, 2006, a news share agreement was established with WRSP/WCCU (then separately controlled). As a result, a nightly prime time newscast began airing on those two stations that was jointly produced by WICS/WICD. Known as &quot;NewsChannel at 9 on Fox Illinois&quot;, it airs for a half-hour from a modified set at WICS&#x27;s Springfield studios featuring unique duratrans indicating the Fox-branded show. From the start, &quot;NewsChannel at 9&quot; competed with a newscast already established in the time slot on then-UPN affiliate WCFN (produced by WCIA).

Unlike the WRSP/WCCU show, WCFN&#x27;s broadcast originated from WCIA&#x27;s Champaign facilities but was targeted specifically at a Springfield audience. Although the WRSP/WCCU newscast featured market wide coverage, including contributions from WICD reporters, there was a separate weeknight weather segment seen on WRSP and WCCU. WCFN&#x27;s prime time broadcast would be eventually canceled by WCIA on September 28, 2009. On October 7, 2013, the weekday edition of &quot;NewsChannel at 9&quot; was expanded to an hour.

The effort on WRSP/WCCU was further expanded on January 20, 2014, when WICS began producing a two-hour weekday morning show for the Fox affiliates. Known as &quot;Good Day Illinois&quot;, the program can be seen from 7 until 9 and offers a local alternative to the national morning programs seen on the big three networks. It also competes with another two-hour local newscast seen at same time on MyNetworkTV affiliate WCIX (produced by WCIA).

On June 26, 2010, rival WAND became the first television station in East-Central Illinois to upgrade news production to high definition level. It would not be until December 2012 that local newscasts seen on WICS would be upgraded to HD. Included with the change was a new set at the Springfield studios and updated Sinclair corporate graphics. Until October 13, 2014, WICD&#x27;s separate weekday newscasts at its Champaign studios were not included in the upgrade because that set lacked high definition cameras.

On March 26, 2011, WICD ceased airing its own newscasts on weekends opting to simulcast those from WICS. These broadcasts are known as &quot;ABC NewsChannel&quot; and feature a common graphics package seen on WICS and WICD. Multimedia journalists based at WICD&#x27;s Champaign studios still provide coverage of the eastern areas of the market. The change represented the second attempt at a joint market-wide product by WICS/WICD. At one point in time, there had been a newscast weeknights at 5 that was simulcast on both outlets originating from Springfield.

On March 13, 2015, Sinclair announced that WICD would shut down its separate news department and cancel its weekday newscasts focused on the eastern areas of the market. This change took effect after the final WICD-produced newscast aired on April 3. In its place are newscasts simulcast from WICS (in all time slots) which provide market-wide coverage, including content from the eastern areas through a downsized bureau at WICD&#x27;s studios. Despite this significant reduction, WICD began airing a full hour-long Champaign-based prime time newscast (weeknights at 9) on WCCU on April 7, 2015, entitled &quot;Fox Champaign News at Nine&quot;.

The existing hour-long WICS-produced newscast on WRSP, which had been simulcast on WCCU, was refocused to Springfield and became known as &quot;Fox News at Nine&quot;. The weekend edition of the prime time news will continue to be a market-wide product simulcast on WRSP and WCCU. With the exception of the WCCU newscast, WICD no longer produces Champaign-specific local news.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WICD shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 15, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41, using virtual channel 15.

<text>In mathematics, especially in functional analysis, the Tsirelson space is the first example of a Banach space in which neither an ℓ &quot;p&quot; space nor a &quot;c&quot;0 space can be embedded. The Tsirelson space is reflexive.

It was introduced by B. S. Tsirelson in 1974. The same year, Figiel and Johnson published a related article () where they used the notation &quot;T&quot; for the &quot;dual&quot; of Tsirelson&#x27;s example. Today, the letter &quot;T&quot; is the standard notation for the dual of the original example, while the original Tsirelson example is denoted by &quot;T&quot;*. In &quot;T&quot;* or in &quot;T&quot;, no subspace is isomorphic, as Banach space, to an &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; space, 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, or to &quot;c&quot;0.

All classical Banach spaces known to , spaces of continuous functions, of differentiable functions or of integrable functions, and all the Banach spaces used in functional analysis for the next forty years, contain some &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; or &quot;c&quot;0. Also, new attempts in the early &#x27;70s to promote a geometric theory of Banach spaces led to ask whether or not &quot;every&quot; infinite-dimensional Banach space has a subspace isomorphic to some &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; or to &quot;c&quot;0. Moreover, it was shown
by Baudier, Lancien, and Schlumprecht that
&quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; and &quot;c&quot;0 do not even coarsely 
embed into T*.

The radically new Tsirelson construction is at the root of several further developments in Banach space theory: the arbitrarily distortable space of Thomas Schlumprecht (), on which depend Gowers&#x27; solution to Banach&#x27;s hyperplane problem and the Odell–Schlumprecht solution to the distortion problem. Also, several results of Argyros et al. are based on ordinal refinements of the Tsirelson construction, culminating with the solution by Argyros–Haydon of the scalar plus compact problem.

== Tsirelson&#x27;s construction ==

On the vector space ℓ∞ of bounded scalar sequences , let &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; denote the linear operator which sets to zero all coordinates &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot; of &quot;x&quot; for which &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;.

A finite sequence formula_1 of vectors in ℓ∞ is called &quot;block-disjoint&quot; if there are natural numbers formula_2 so that formula_3, and so that formula_4 when formula_5 or formula_6, for each &quot;n&quot; from 1 to &quot;N&quot;.
The unit ball  &quot;B&quot;∞  of ℓ∞ is compact and metrizable for the topology of pointwise convergence (the product topology). The crucial step in the Tsirelson construction is to let &quot;K&quot; be the &quot;smallest&quot; pointwise closed subset of  &quot;B&quot;∞  satisfying the following two properties:
:a. For every integer  &quot;j&quot;  in N, the unit vector &quot;e&quot;&quot;j&quot; and all multiples formula_7, for |λ| ≤ 1, belong to &quot;K&quot;.
:b. For any integer &quot;N&quot; ≥ 1, if formula_8 is a block-disjoint sequence in &quot;K&quot;, then formula_9 belongs to &quot;K&quot;.
This set &quot;K&quot; satisfies the following stability property:
:c. Together with every element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, the set &quot;K&quot; contains all vectors &quot;y&quot; in ℓ∞ such that |&quot;y&quot;| ≤ |&quot;x&quot;| (for the pointwise comparison).
It is then shown that &quot;K&quot; is actually a subset of &quot;c&quot;0, the Banach subspace of ℓ∞ consisting of scalar sequences tending to zero at infinity. This is done by proving that
:d: for every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;K&quot;, there exists an integer &quot;n&quot; such that 2 &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) belongs to &quot;K&quot;,
and iterating this fact. Since &quot;K&quot; is pointwise compact and contained in &quot;c&quot;0, it is weakly compact in &quot;c&quot;0. Let &quot;V&quot; be the closed convex hull of &quot;K&quot; in &quot;c&quot;0. It is also a weakly compact set in &quot;c&quot;0. It is shown that &quot;V&quot; satisfies b, c and d.

The Tsirelson space &quot;T&quot;* is the Banach space whose unit ball is &quot;V&quot;. The unit vector basis is an unconditional basis for &quot;T&quot;* and &quot;T&quot;* is reflexive. Therefore, &quot;T&quot;* does not contain an isomorphic copy of &quot;c&quot;0. The other &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; spaces, 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞, are ruled out by condition b.

== Properties ==

The Tsirelson space {{mvar|T*}} is reflexive ({{harvtxt|Tsirel&#x27;son|1974}}) and finitely universal, which means that for some constant {{nowrap|{{mvar|C}} ≥ 1}}, the space {{mvar|T*}} contains {{mvar|C}}-isomorphic copies of every finite-dimensional normed space, namely, for every finite-dimensional normed space {{mvar|X}}, there exists a subspace {{mvar|Y}} of the Tsirelson space with multiplicative Banach–Mazur distance to {{mvar|X}} less than {{mvar|C}}. Actually, every finitely universal Banach space contains &quot;almost-isometric&quot; copies of every finite-dimensional normed space, meaning that {{mvar|C}} can be replaced by {{nowrap|1 + ε}} for every {{nowrap|ε &gt; 0}}. Also, every infinite-dimensional subspace of {{mvar|T*}} is finitely universal. On the other hand, every infinite-dimensional subspace in the dual {{mvar|T}} of {{mvar|T*}} contains almost isometric copies of formula_10, the {{mvar|n}}-dimensional ℓ1-space, for all {{mvar|n}}.

The Tsirelson space {{mvar|T}} is distortable, but it is not known whether it is arbitrarily distortable.

The space {{mvar|T*}} is a &quot;minimal&quot; Banach space. This means that every infinite-dimensional Banach subspace of {{mvar|T*}} contains a further subspace isomorphic to {{mvar|T*}}. Prior to the construction of {{mvar|T*}}, the only known examples of minimal spaces were &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; and {{mvar|c}}0. The dual space {{mvar|T}} is not minimal.

The space {{mvar|T*}} is polynomially reflexive.

== Derived spaces ==

The symmetric Tsirelson space &quot;S&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is polynomially reflexive and it has the approximation property. As with &quot;T&quot;, it is reflexive and no &quot;ℓ&quot; &quot;p&quot; space can be embedded into it.

Since it is symmetric, it can be defined even on an uncountable supporting set, giving an example of non-separable polynomially reflexive Banach space.

<text>KGAN (channel 2) is a television station licensed to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States, serving Eastern Iowa as an affiliate of CBS and Fox. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which provides certain services to Dabl affiliate KFXA (channel 28, also licensed to Cedar Rapids) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Second Generation of Iowa, Ltd. The two stations share studios at Broadcast Park on Old Marion Road Northeast (along IA 100) in Cedar Rapids; KGAN&#x27;s transmitter is located in Rowley, near the junction of Buchanan, Benton and Linn counties.

Channel 2 was the first television station in Eastern Iowa, signing on as WMT-TV on September 30, 1953. It was originally the radio adjunct to Cedar Rapids radio station WMT. A CBS affiliate from its first day on air, channel 2 initially dominated television in the region until other stations caught up. Its original ownership, American Broadcasting Stations, sold WMT radio and television to Orion Broadcasting in 1981; when Orion merged with Cosmos Broadcasting, channel 2 was split from WMT and renamed KGAN by its new owner, Guy Gannett. After being second in news ratings in the 1980s, KGAN sank to third by the early 1990s, a position it continues to hold in the market. Sinclair acquired KGAN as part of its 1999 purchase of Guy Gannett. The Fox programming previously on KFXA relocated to a subchannel of KGAN on January 1, 2021.

==History==
===Construction and early years===
American Broadcasting Stations, Inc., the owner of Cedar Rapids radio station WMT (600 AM), applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on January 10, 1951, for permission to build a new television station on channel 9. In June 1952, after the FCC lifted its four-year freeze on television station grants and changed many channel allocations nationally, the application was amended to specify channel 2. In addition to the WMT application, the Davenport Broadcasting Company, owner of KSTT in Davenport, sought to build channel 2. American Broadcasting Stations charged that Davenport Broadcasting was not financially qualified to build the station.

On April 8, 1953, after Davenport withdrew from contention, the FCC approved American Broadcasting Stations&#x27;s application and granted a construction permit. WMT-TV began regular broadcasting on September 30, 1953, as the first station in Eastern Iowa; after brief remarks by general manager and part-owner William B. Quarton, the station aired Game 1 of the 1953 World Series. The Series was carried by special arrangement with NBC, but WMT-TV was a primary affiliate of CBS with selected programs of the DuMont Television Network. Live local programming did not appear immediately because the studios on Old Marion Road were under construction. As a promotional tactic, the new TV station paid its employees in unusual two-dollar bills. It boasted that it was the first station to broadcast with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts (the maximum for channels 2 through 6).

WMT-TV began construction of a new, taller tower near Walker in June 1956. The structure, intended to be tall, was toppled in a windstorm on December 10, having reached in height. The structure was rebuilt and put into use in July 1957. In April 1967, the station converted to color for local programming.

In December 1967, American Broadcasting Stations announced it was negotiating to sell WMT radio and television to WAVE Inc. of Louisville, Kentucky; the $9.98 million purchase was approved by the FCC in June 1968. In 1969, WAVE, Inc. renamed itself Orion Broadcasting in reflection of its broadcasting holdings beyond Louisville.

===Guy Gannett ownership===
Orion Broadcasting announced in April 1980 that it would put all of its stations up for sale. The Morton and Norton families opted to sell the entire company in order to avoid paying inheritance taxes when 71-year-old Mrs. George Norton eventually died, taxes they were not sure the company could pay. Two months later, Orion announced it would merge with Cosmos Broadcasting, a subsidiary of insurance and broadcasting conglomerate Liberty Corporation. However, the two companies together owned eight very high frequency (VHF) television stations, three more than the FCC allowed at the time. As a condition of the merger, Cosmos opted to sell WMT-TV as well as WFRV-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and WJMN-TV in Escanaba, Michigan.

Guy Gannett Broadcasting Services of Portland, Maine, agreed to acquire WMT-TV in February 1981, becoming the company&#x27;s third television station and first in the Midwest. As Cosmos retained WMT radio and the radio stations would retain the WMT call letters, a new designation was required for channel 2. Guy Gannett selected KGAN, which mirrored the company&#x27;s WGAN-TV in Portland. The sale was completed on October 16, 1981, at which time WMT-TV became KGAN-TV.

===Sinclair ownership===
Motivated by the impending expiration of the family trust that owned the company, Guy Gannett Communications put itself up for sale in 1998. The Seattle Times Company acquired Guy Gannett&#x27;s newspapers, while the firm&#x27;s television stations were purchased by Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group. The Guy Gannett purchase gave Sinclair diversification into affiliates of the Big Three networks and beyond a portfolio heavy with Fox, WB, and UPN stations.

Sinclair attempted later that year to sell KGAN and two ex-Guy Gannett stations in Illinois—WICS in Springfield and WICD in Champaign—to Sunrise Television. At the time, Sinclair was attempting to shed some of the smaller-market stations it had acquired in a string of recent purchases to improve its balance sheet. The deal never received approval from the FCC or the United States Department of Justice because of the ownership structure of Sunrise, which was affiliated with investment firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst. That firm was also majority stockholder of the LIN TV Corporation. At the time, LIN owned WAND in Decatur, a rival to WICS/WICD.

In 2002, Sinclair and Second Generation of Iowa, owner of KFXA, entered into an outsourcing agreement whereby Sinclair began providing KFXA&#x27;s sales and other non-programming services. Sinclair then acquired the assets of KFXA, except the license, in 2008. On January 1, 2021, the programming and Fox affiliation of KFXA&#x27;s main subchannel became the 2.2 subchannel of KGAN.

KGAN began broadcasting a digital signal on October 26, 2002. The station has been digital-only since February 17, 2009; however, the station later asked to move down from its original channel of 51 due to the limitations of the channel 51 signal and no buffer being left between it and wireless and cellular services occupying the spectrum formerly allocated to channels 52-69. On the morning of April 5, 2014, the station moved to channel 29.

==News operation==
The station established a local news department in early 1954 and immediately launched a weeknight 6p.m. newscast. That fall, a 10p.m. local newscast was added, followed by a noon news program in 1956. WMT-TV was the dominant television news source in Eastern Iowa in its early years. A February 1965 Arbitron survey found that 71,000 households watched WMT&#x27;s late news, whereas competitors KWWL and KCRG-TV between them only attracted 33,000. In part, this was due to the consulting work of Marion-based Frank Magid; WMT-TV was the firm&#x27;s first client, and its success attracted other station groups to the company.

However, in the late 1960s, KWWL and KCRG began to make significant investments in local news programming that made them competitive in the market, with KWWL pulling nearly level with channel 2 by 1979. At the time, WMT-TV made a critical mistake in ousting meteorologist Craig Johnson in favor of Bill Bailey, a popular comedic weatherman in the Quad Cities market at WOC-TV. However, in his time on air at channel 2, ratings fell, and KWWL surpassed the station in the ratings; Bailey left and returned to the Quad Cities. During the time KWWL ascended to first place in the market, its news director was Grant Price, who had previously parted ways with WMT-TV in 1972 over philosophical differences.

KGAN remained in second place in the 1980s, managing to hold off a challenge from KCRG. However, in 1989, two Daves left the evening newscasts. Dave Shay moved to the noon news after 30 years, a step toward retirement, while Dave Towne was released and several weeks later began at KCRG. His replacement, Mark Strehl, lasted just two years; when his contract was not renewed, he characterized KGAN as a &quot;revolving door&quot; with constant anchor changes.

In March 2001, KGAN began producing a 9p.m. newscast for Sinclair-owned KDSM-TV in Des Moines. After KGAN began providing services to KFXA in 2002, the program was renamed to &quot;Fox News at Nine&quot; and began to air in Eastern Iowa that October. A 7a.m. news hour was added to KFXA in 2011.

The station has won two George Foster Peabody Awards. The first award, in 1955, came for its role in developing &quot;The Secret of Flight&quot; television programs. These shows, focusing on aeronautical education, were made possible with the assistance of Alexander Lippisch, who was the director of the Collins Aeronautical Research Laboratory. In 1994, KGAN won another Peabody for exposing a sewer solvent scandal in which the city bought solvent at an 800 percent markup from a local chemical company.

<text>KDSM-TV (channel 17) is a television station in Des Moines, Iowa, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. The station is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group and has studios on Fleur Drive in Des Moines; its transmitter is located in Alleman, Iowa.

Channel 17 began broadcasting as KCBR, Des Moines&#x27;s first independent station, on March 7, 1983. It was locally owned by the Independence Broadcasting Company. It was purchased by Duchossois Communications in 1985. Under Duchossois, the station changed its call sign to KDSM-TV in 1986, affiliated with the then-new Fox network, and became the local broadcaster of syndicated Iowa Hawkeyes men&#x27;s basketball, which dramatically boosted its visibility and regional cable carriage. River City Broadcasting acquired KDSM-TV in 1990 and boosted its promotion of Fox programming. It soon surpassed ABC affiliate WOI-TV, long the market&#x27;s distant third-rated station, in total revenue.

After River City merged with Sinclair in 1996, KDSM began broadcasting a local newscast in 2001. The newscast was presented from Sinclair-owned KGAN in Cedar Rapids using Des Moines–based news staff. In 2008, this was replaced with a local newscast produced by WHO-DT (channel 13). KDSM became the market&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) broadcaster in 2023.

==History==
Channel 17 was the second television channel to be activated in central Iowa, nearly 30 years before the present station. KGTV was the first station in Des Moines itself; it operated from November 1953 to April 1955, when it folded amid economic struggles inherent in early UHF broadcasting. Two parties expressed interest in the channel in the two decades after the station folded. In 1966, Stoner Television Company of Des Moines filed to build and operate channel 17, and in 1970, the permittees of unbuilt station KWIG sought to change their assignment from channel 63 to channel 17.

===KCBR: Early years===
In April 1979, Koplar Broadcasting of St. Louis announced its intention to build a new independent station on channel 17 to serve Des Moines. Koplar proposed to model the station, which it called KRBK, after its successful KPLR-TV in St. Louis. The next month, the Independence Broadcasting Company—owned by Raymond Gazzo, William Trout, and Carl Goldsberry of Des Moines—made an application of its own. Goldsberry was a Northwestern Bell yellow pages sales representative, while Trout and Gazzo were partners in a Des Moines law firm. The looming fight of Koplar versus Independence was compared by Evan Roth of the &quot;Des Moines Tribune&quot; to a &quot;David and Goliath&quot; contest. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated their applications as well as bids from Greater Des Moines Vision Ltd. and Columbia Iowa TV Ltd. for comparative hearing on March 13, 1981.

In April 1982, an FCC administrative law judge awarded channel 17 to Independence Broadcasting, not long after the four applicants reached a settlement agreement by which Independence reimbursed them for their expenses. The company initially selected a downtown studio site on 3rd Street, but by October it had instead found space in a building on Park Avenue. 

A mild and wet winter caused difficulties with construction of the station&#x27;s tower at Alleman. Construction equipment bogged down in muddy terrain. KCBR had initially set a January 17, 1983, start date, but the tower construction company started work two months late; by early January, the tower had reached less than half its planned height. Channel 17 broadcast for the first time on the afternoon of March 7, 1983; its official sign-on was a week later, on March 14. KCBR offered viewers a schedule of movies, syndicated and children&#x27;s shows, and sports, as well as two locally produced public affairs shows.

Independence Broadcasting reached a $9 million deal in late October 1984 to sell KCBR to Citadel Communications, a company owned by East Coast investors led by former Corinthian Broadcasting president Philip Lombardo. The transaction fell apart, leading Independence to sue Citadel for breach of contract in late December.

===KDSM: Duchossois and River City ownership===
After the failure of the Citadel sale attempt, Independence agreed to sell KCBR for $8.3 million to Duchossois Communications of Lafayette, Indiana, in February 1985. Duchossois owned radio stations in Lafayette and in Duluth, Minnesota, but this was its first venture into television. Its parent company—Duchossois Enterprises, owned by Richard L. Duchossois—was associated with various industrial companies and the Arlington Park race track near Chicago.

Duchossois moved the station out of its existing studios and to a former NCR building on Fleur Drive. This gave channel 17 in-house production facilities instead of relying on a truck as it had for its first two years. On January 17, 1986, KCBR changed its call sign to KDSM-TV as part of an upgrade in the station&#x27;s on-air image. The station joined the new Fox network when it launched that October.

In 1987, KDSM-TV scored a coup when it won the Des Moines–area rights to telecast live Iowa Hawkeyes men&#x27;s basketball and replays of Iowa Hawkeyes football, displacing WHO-TV. It had already secured the central Iowa rights to syndicated Big Ten Conference football and basketball, making it the television home for all Hawkeye athletic events that did not air on Big Three networks or cable. The deal with the Hawkeyes was instantly seen as giving channel 17 increased credibility in the market. Iowa basketball was among the most popular syndicated programs anywhere in the country at the time; to complement the Hawkeyes, under general manager Tommy Thompson, channel 17 acquired the rights to telecast the state high school basketball tournaments and by 1991 was producing coverage of the boys&#x27; tournament for statewide broadcast. These acquisitions increased the station&#x27;s cable footprint, as systems in fringe areas beyond metro Des Moines added channel 17 for its sports telecasts. Under Duchossois, KDSM-TV increased its share of advertising revenue in the Des Moines market from six percent in 1985 to eleven to fourteen percent in 1990.

River City Broadcasting of St. Louis agreed to purchase KDSM-TV for $13.5 million in November 1990; the buyers touted their ability to buy for KDSM and other stations they owned and to upgrade the station&#x27;s on-air look using equipment at its flagship station, KDNL-TV. River City took over in July 1991 and dismissed Thompson two months later; Thompson claimed River City effectively fired him by making changes to his employment agreement. One of River City&#x27;s major moves was to &quot;Fox-ify&quot; the station&#x27;s image and aggressively promote its network affiliation. This included hiring on-air hosts for the station&#x27;s Fox 17 Kids Club, increasing community involvement, and commissioning an artist to paint a mural of Fox network stars in the station&#x27;s lobby.

Beginning in 1995, KDSM served as a secondary affiliate of the new UPN network, airing its shows in late-night hours. In 1998, the station discontinued its carriage of UPN programming, citing increasing demands of Fox sports programming. It picked up &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; the next year when it went into syndication.

===Sinclair ownership===
On April 11, 1996, River City announced that it would merge with the Sinclair Broadcast Group for $2.3 billion, creating a company with 29 television and 34 radio stations nationwide. The transaction valued KDSM at between $35 million and $45 million, roughly triple its value compared to the purchase price River City paid in 1991. By 1996, the station was believed to have surpassed WOI-TV, the city&#x27;s third-rated station and an ABC affiliate, in revenue by a significant margin. Its costs were kept low by the lack of a news department and new network affiliation agreements in the industry that made it harder for Big Three affiliates to bid on sports packages like Iowa basketball. Big Ten Conference basketball, including the Hawkeyes, remained on the station through 2007, when the Big Ten Network cable channel launched. KDSM began broadcasting a digital signal on April 19, 2002, and joined WHO in shutting off analog broadcasts on the original transition date of February 17, 2009; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 16, using virtual channel 17.

KDSM-TV was taken off air for all viewers except those on local cable systems for a time in May 2019 after a failure in its transmission line. WHO-TV provided transmission facilities to restore an over-the-air signal. During repairs on the mast, a worker fell from a height of to his death.

==Newscasts==

As early as 1990, KDSM-TV considered introducing a 9 p.m. newscast, and management under Duchossois and River City mulled the possibility for several years. Tom MacArthur, who ran the station under River City, chafed at the fact that advertising agencies often refused to buy advertising for agricultural products outside of newscasts, which his station lacked.

By 1998, Fox was steering affiliates to add newscasts, leading to planning to debut a local news program on channel 17. In March 2001, Sinclair-owned KGAN in Cedar Rapids began producing a 9p.m. newscast for KDSM-TV. The program was presented by KGAN&#x27;s news team using reporters based in the Des Moines area. It competed with a new 9 p.m. newscast from WHO-TV produced for Pax station KFPX-TV. After KGAN began providing services to Cedar Rapids Fox affiliate KFXA in 2002, the program was renamed to &quot;Fox News at Nine&quot; and began to air in Eastern Iowa that October.

The regional newscast from Cedar Rapids was replaced in September 2008 with a new nightly local newscast produced by WHO-TV. The new &quot;13 News at 9 on Fox 17&quot; was an hour long on weeknights, whereas the KGAN-produced program was only half an hour long.

<text>KBSI (channel 23) is a television station licensed to Cape Girardeau, Missouri, United States, serving as the Fox affiliate for Southeastern Missouri, the Purchase area of Western Kentucky, Southern Illinois, and Northwest Tennessee. It is owned by the Community News Media subsidiary of Standard Media alongside Paducah, Kentucky–licensed MyNetworkTV affiliate WDKA (channel 49). The two stations share studios on Enterprise Street in Cape Girardeau; KBSI&#x27;s transmitter is located in unincorporated Cape Girardeau County north of the city.

==History==
The station signed on the air on September 10, 1983, as an independent station and aired an analog signal on UHF channel 23. The station was originally owned by Cape Girardeau Family Television, Ltd., in turn 51 percent owned by Media Central of Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was not the first independent to operate in the market—two stations broadcast in southern Illinois, and a prior attempt had been made at an independent in Paducah—but it was the first to cover all of it, which was the reason Media Central had been attracted to the area.

Media Central filed for bankruptcy in 1987 to fend off a hostile takeover attempt. That same year, despite having passed on the opportunity a year prior, KBSI joined Fox on September 7, in part because of the Media Central bankruptcy. Media Central continued to own the station until a bankruptcy judge approved its acquisition by Engles Communications, owned by David Engles, a former Warner Bros. and NBC radio executive. Under Engles, KBSI picked up the first season of &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; when ABC affiliate WSIL-TV refused to air the show.

Engles then sold the station to Max Television (later Max Media Properties) in 1995. In 1998, Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired most of the Max Media Properties stations, including KBSI; it owned KBSI and later WDKA in Paducah until both were sold to Community News Media for $28 million in a transaction that closed in 2021.

==Newscasts==
From 2006 to September 30, 2010, NBC affiliate WPSD-TV (owned by the Paxton Media Group) produced a nightly prime time newscast for KBSI through a news share agreement. When the WPSD newscast started, KBSI competed with another nightly half-hour newscast at 9 p.m. on the area&#x27;s low-powered CW affiliates WQTV-LP/WQWQ-LP. That newscast, produced by CBS affiliate KFVS-TV, focused on news from southeastern Missouri and was eventually canceled on July 29, 2007.

On October 1, 2010, KBSI entered into a new agreement with KFVS to produce the newscast, which expanded to an hour in length. This agreement ended in March 2022 with KFVS moving the newscast to KFVS-DT2. On March 28, 2022, KBSI debuted its own newscast, produced out of Lincoln, Nebraska, at sister station KLKN. The news and weather anchors are based in Lincoln while the reporters work out of the KBSI studios in Cape Girardeau.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KBSI shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 23, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22, using virtual channel 23.

<text>WDKA (channel 49) is a television station licensed to Paducah, Kentucky, United States, serving as the MyNetworkTV affiliate for Western Kentucky&#x27;s Purchase region, Southern Illinois and Southeastern Missouri, and Northwest Tennessee. It is owned by the Community News Media subsidiary of Standard Media alongside Cape Girardeau, Missouri–licensed Fox affiliate KBSI (channel 23). Both stations share studios on Enterprise Street in Cape Girardeau, while WDKA&#x27;s transmitter is located in Vienna, Illinois.

In addition to its own digital signal, WDKA is simulcast in standard definition on KBSI&#x27;s second digital subchannel (23.2) from a transmitter north of Cape Girardeau in unincorporated Cape Girardeau County.

==History==
WDKA began broadcasting on June 5, 1997. It was a UPN affiliate broadcasting an analog signal on UHF channel 49. In 2000, WDKA switched affiliations with low-powered station WQTV-LP (licensed to Murray, Kentucky) and repeater WQWQ-LP to become an affiliate of The WB. In September 2006, The WB and UPN merged to become The CW, and WQTV-LP was announced to become The CW affiliate for Paducah in advance of the merger. As a result, WDKA became affiliated with MyNetworkTV when it launched on September 5. 

On August 30, 2014, WDKA became a charter affiliate of Sinclair&#x27;s ad-hoc syndicated television network, the American Sports Network. ASN provided Ohio Valley Conference basketball and Conference USA football and basketball games to the station&#x27;s viewers. The ASN&#x27;s programming content replaced Southeastern Conference football and basketball broadcasts from ESPN Plus-oriented SEC TV, which was run from 2009 until 2014, which was discontinued because of the launch of the pay TV-exclusive SEC Network. 

On March 3, 2016, WDKA Acquisition Corporation (owned by Paul T. Lucci) filed to sell WDKA to Sinclair&#x27;s subsidiary WDKA Licensee, LLC. Sinclair bought the station for $1.9 million. The sale was completed on September 1, 2017.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WDKA shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 49, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 50, using virtual channel 49.

===Spectrum reallocation===
In October 2019, WDKA reallocated its digital signal onto UHF channel 25 as a result of the station&#x27;s participation in the FCC&#x27;s spectrum incentive auction.

<text>WBFF (channel 45) is a television station in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, affiliated with Fox and MyNetworkTV. It is one of two flagship stations of Sinclair Broadcast Group (based in nearby Hunt Valley), alongside ABC affiliate WJLA-TV (channel 7) in Washington, D.C. Sinclair maintains a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Cunningham Broadcasting, owner of CW affiliate WNUV (channel 54), and a shared services agreement (SSA) with Deerfield Media, owner of TBD affiliate WUTB (channel 24).

The three stations share studios on 41st Street off the Jones Falls Expressway on &quot;Television Hill&quot; in the Woodberry neighborhood of north Baltimore. Through a channel sharing agreement, WBFF and WUTB transmit using the former station&#x27;s spectrum from an antenna adjacent to the studios. The tall tower stands near the earlier landmark &quot;candelabra tower&quot; from the late 1950s in use by the city&#x27;s original three main VHF stations (WMAR-TV, WBAL-TV, and WJZ-TV).

==History==
WBFF first came on the air on April 11, 1971, founded by what was then called the Chesapeake Television Corporation, which was controlled by Julian Sinclair Smith. The original meaning of its call sign was &quot;Baltimore&#x27;s Finest Features&quot; because it primarily aired old movies in its earliest years. It was Baltimore&#x27;s second commercial UHF station and second independent station, signing on four years after WMET-TV (channel 24, frequency now occupied by WUTB) began operations. Both stations aired general entertainment programming, but WMET&#x27;s owners experienced financial problems and were forced to take channel 24 off the air in 1972.

Even without direct competition, and operating on a small budget, WBFF still struggled for strong programming during the 1970s as Baltimore&#x27;s network affiliates—WBAL-TV, WJZ-TV and WMAR-TV—continued to acquire off-network syndicated programs during this period. It did not help matters that Washington&#x27;s WTTG and WDCA were readily available both over the air (Washington stations all provided a strong signal into Baltimore) and on cable. Channel 45 did find an advantage in having a decent library of movies, sitcoms and westerns at its disposal. Like other independent stations of that era, WBFF also ran network programs preempted by the local affiliates, local public affairs programs, and played cartoons and series reruns in the afternoon for the after-school kids crowd in a show hosted by nostalgic &quot;Captain Chesapeake&quot; (played by George Lewis) along with his side-kick &quot;Mondy&quot; the sea monster played by James Uhrin (who continued to work at WBFF under the alias &quot;Traffic Jam Jimmy&quot;) as they cruised through the Bay. &quot;Captain Chesapeake&quot; was a fixture on WBFF from its beginnings until 1990, with his famous cheery greeting: &quot;Ahoyyy Crewmembers!!&quot;
Despite its financial troubles, WBFF became profitable enough that Julian Smith decided to expand his broadcast interests. Through a Chesapeake Television subsidiary, Commercial Radio Institute, Smith launched a new independent station in Pittsburgh, WPTT (now WPNT), in 1978. In 1984, Commercial Radio Institute signed on Smith&#x27;s third station, independent WTTE in Columbus, Ohio. That same year, WBFF received local competition again when WNUV-TV, then a two-year-old subscription television outlet, began to adopt a general entertainment schedule during the daytime and full-time by 1986.

In 1985, Julian Smith merged his three stations into the Sinclair Broadcast Group, and around this time one of his sons, David D. Smith, took a prominent role in the operations of the three stations. In 1986, Sinclair agreed to affiliate WBFF and WTTE with the fledgling Fox Broadcasting Company, which debuted on October 9 of that year. The growth and rise of Fox coincided with that of Sinclair Broadcast Group, which expanded its reach beyond Baltimore, Columbus and Pittsburgh during the 1990s.

In June 1991, Sinclair opened up the station&#x27;s news department with Baltimore&#x27;s first 10 p.m. newscast co-anchored by Lisa Willis (formerly of WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey) and Jeff Barnd. Then, in September, Sinclair took the bold step of challenging WMAR-TV&#x27;s pending license renewal and filing its own competing application for a new station. As WMAR-TV had been sold the previous June to the E. W. Scripps Company, Sinclair argued that an out-of-town corporation could not effectively serve the city&#x27;s public interest and the valuable channel allocation—a channel 2 analog signal traveled a very long distance under normal conditions—should be granted to an established local broadcaster instead. The gambit did not work, and WMAR-TV remained on channel 2.

WBFF nearly lost its Fox affiliation in 1994 when Fox entered talks with WJZ-TV, but it opted to affiliate with CBS instead. WBAL-TV was also considered after the station dropped CBS, but opted to affiliate with NBC instead.

In 1996, Channel 45 began airing Baltimore Ravens games via the NFL on Fox; the station is given at least two games a season to air (usually when the team plays host to an NFC team at M&amp;T Bank Stadium); starting in 2014, when the NFL instituted its new &#x27;cross-flex&#x27; broadcast rules, games can be arbitrarily moved from WJZ-TV to WBFF. Additionally, the station aired all &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games involving the Ravens from 2018 to 2021 through Fox&#x27;s exclusive contract.
Sinclair purchased Abry Communications, owner of WNUV, in 1994. As duopolies were not allowed at the time, channel 54 was spun off to Glencairn Ltd., a company owned by former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards. However, Glencairn&#x27;s stock was almost entirely owned by the Smith family. In effect, Sinclair now had a duopoly in Baltimore—and had emasculated its major rival in its hometown. Sinclair further circumvented the rules by taking over WNUV&#x27;s operations under a local marketing agreement (LMA), with WBFF as senior partner.

Sinclair tried to buy Glencairn outright in 2001, but was unable to buy WNUV due to the FCC&#x27;s rules on duopolies. Despite its relatively large size, the Baltimore market has only seven full-power stations (or six, if two stations licensed in the market that are operated by Maryland Public Television are treated as one)—two fewer than what FCC regulations allow to legally permit a duopoly (the FCC requires a market to have eight unique station owners once a duopoly is formed, effectively limiting duopolies to markets with at least nine full-power stations). Glencairn changed its name to Cunningham Broadcasting and retained ownership of WNUV. However, nearly all of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is held in trusts owned by the Smiths. This &quot;de facto&quot; duopoly continues to this day, while the close relationship between Sinclair and Glencairn/Cunningham has led to claims that Cunningham is merely a corporate shell that Sinclair uses in order to evade FCC ownership restrictions.

While WBFF entered the new century thriving as both locally and as a Fox affiliate, its network partner threatened the station&#x27;s immediate future. In 2001, Fox&#x27;s parent company, the News Corporation, became the new owner of Baltimore&#x27;s UPN affiliate WUTB (the former WMET-TV) through its purchase of most of Chris-Craft Industries&#x27; television holdings. Rumors abounded that Fox was considering moving its programming from WBFF to WUTB. In a move made clearly to protect its home interests, Sinclair persuaded Fox to sign a long-term contract to keep WBFF with the network. The same threat re-emerged in January 2006, when UPN owner CBS Corporation and Time Warner, owners of The WB Television Network, announced that those two networks would be shut down and replaced by the new CW Television Network. However, a month after The CW&#x27;s formation, News Corporation announced that WUTB and its other UPN affiliates would become the nuclei of its new MyNetworkTV service.

On May 1, 2006, the station launched its .2 digital channel with retro programming, the first non-weather subchannel in the market.

On May 15, 2012, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network&#x27;s affiliation agreement with Sinclair&#x27;s 19 Fox stations, including WBFF, that will run through 2017. This included an option (that was exercisable from July 1, 2012, to March 31, 2013) to allow Sinclair to purchase WUTB, resulting in the creation of a virtual triopoly with WBFF and WNUV; while giving Fox the option to buy any combination of six CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates (two of which were standalone stations affiliated with the latter service) owned by Sinclair in three of four markets: Raleigh (WLFL and WRDC), Las Vegas (KVCW and KVMY), Cincinnati (WSTR-TV) and Norfolk (WTVZ). Under the agreement and the WUTB purchase option, Sinclair would pay $52.7 million to continue WBFF&#x27;s affiliation with Fox; however, if Fox exercised the option to buy any of the Sinclair stations that were included in the option, the affiliation payments would decrease to $25 million. On November 29, 2012, Sinclair exercised its option to purchase WUTB through Deerfield Media for $2.7 million. Following the completion of the sale, WUTB began to be operated by Sinclair under a local marketing agreement, as with Deerfield&#x27;s other stations. In January 2013, Fox announced that it would not exercise its option to buy any of the Sinclair stations included in the earlier purchase option. On May 6, 2013, the FCC granted its approval of WUTB to Deerfield Media. Sinclair officially took over the operations of WUTB eight days later, although the sale was not formally consummated until June 1. With the completion of the WUTB sale, this makes Baltimore the largest market where one company (outside of non-commercial public television station groups) operates a virtual triopoly between full-power stations. WBFF remains the only station in the Baltimore market never to change its primary network affiliate.

On the afternoon of April 28, 2016, WBFF&#x27;s studios were evacuated in response to a threat by a person wearing a hoax bomb; the suspect also allegedly set his vehicle on fire in the station&#x27;s parking lot. The suspect was later shot and apprehended by police; besides a desire to share end times prophecy content with the station (a USB drive with videos was confiscated by a security guard), no specific motive for the incident was determined.

==WBFF-DT2==
On May 1, 2006, WBFF launched a new service on its second digital subchannel (45.2) originally called WBFF-2, which was later renamed Good TV. This digital-only channel featured classic television programs&#x27; (its format predated the existence of several nationally distributed digital multicast networks focused on classic television programming such as MeTV, Antenna TV and Retro Television Network). In addition, &quot;Good TV&quot; offered expanded coverage of church services on Sunday mornings, local events, and paid programming. This channel ceased broadcasting on or around September 30, 2008, to make way for This TV until 2017, when it was replaced with TBD programming. In July 2021, TBD moved to WUTB; that station&#x27;s previous &quot;My TV Baltimore&quot; programming, including the MyNetworkTV lineup, in turn moved to the 45.2 subchannel.

==News operation==
WBFF presently broadcasts 55 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, four hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among Baltimore&#x27;s broadcast television stations as well as in the state of Maryland in general. It is also the highest output of Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s stations (both out of its Fox affiliates and the company&#x27;s overall television stations).

Sinclair decided to invest in developing a news department for WBFF, with the station launching a nightly 10 p.m. newscast on June 3, 1991, co-anchored by Lisa Willis (formerly of WWOR-TV) and Jeff Barnd. The station added a weekday morning newscast in March 2000. In February 2003, it added a weeknight 11 p.m. newscast that was broadcast from Sinclair&#x27;s now-defunct centralized news service, News Central, located in Hunt Valley. The start time of the weekday morning newscast was moved to 5:30 a.m. and an early evening newscast at 5:30 p.m. was subsequently added to the schedule in January 2005. On June 2, 2008, WBFF became the first Baltimore television station to begin broadcast its local newscasts in high definition.

Jeff Barnd, a former WBFF news anchor, also hosted and provided commentary for the Sinclair-distributed syndicated news program &quot;American Crossroads&quot;. WBFF was featured in an episode during the third season of &quot;The Simple Life&quot;. On that episode, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie took control of the station&#x27;s weekday morning newscast. The two read the weather forecast and messed with the teleprompter. Tony Harris, later a CNN anchor, was once WBFF&#x27;s lead anchor (co-anchoring with Lisa Willis). In 2015, former WJZ-TV co-anchor Kai Jackson was named the station&#x27;s lead anchor.

On January 24, 2011, WBFF expanded its weekday morning newscast from four to five hours to 5–10 a.m. weekdays, with the 9 a.m. edition called &quot;Fox 45 Good Day Baltimore&quot;. On April 9, 2012, WBFF expanded its early evening newscast by adding another half-hour at 5 p.m., shifting &quot;Judge Judy&quot; to a full-hour at 4 p.m.; the 5:30 p.m. newscast remains, but is treated as a separate newscast. In 2015 the station added a 4 p.m. newscast pushing &quot;Judge Judy&quot; back to 3 p.m. On January 20, 2013, WBFF debuted weekend morning newscasts, featuring a two-hour Saturday morning newscast and three hours of newscasts on Sunday mornings (with the third hour of the Sunday newscast airing after &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;).

===Controversy===
On December 21, 2014, WBFF&#x27;s news operation came under criticism for airing a video that some allege had misleading edits. The video was of a protest over police brutality in the aftermath of the killing of Eric Garner, where protesters, led by a Baltimore woman named Tawanda Jones, chanted &quot;We won&#x27;t stop. We can&#x27;t stop till killer cops are in cellblocks.&quot; The video, as edited and shown on the station&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast, made it seem like protesters were chanting &quot;kill a cop&quot;. A day after the video aired, WBFF issued an apology over the edited video online, saying the report reflected an &quot;honest misunderstanding&quot; of what the protesters were chanting, and that the report has been removed from the station&#x27;s website. A news anchor for the station later made an in-person apology to Jones, who appeared during the station&#x27;s 5:30 p.m. newscast.

In the aftermath of the incident, reporter Melinda Roeder and photographer Greg McNair were fired from the station in connection with their alleged involvement with the video. The station&#x27;s news director at the time, Mike Tomko, was suspended for one day.

The station would again stoke controversy in June 2024, when the guild for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; revealed that several stories in the newspaper had been repurposed from the news staff of WBFF without their prior knowledge, including existing content being edited around WBFF&#x27;s own reporting rather than that of the reporter of &quot;The Sun&quot;. The paper had been acquired in February of the same year by a consortium led by Sinclair chairman David Smith and Armstrong Williams, a conservative commentator who owns several stations that have shared service agreements with Sinclair and whose weekly program is carried by its stations. The station had come under fire at the same time for alarmism involving its coverage of crime occurring in the Fells Point neighborhood.

In December 2024, The Sentencing Project released a report analyzing how juvenile crime is reported in six of Baltimore&#x27;s leading media outlets. In the report, the organization found that problematic coverage of youth crime was especially prevalent on WBFF, with the station being much more likely to air fear-inducing and sensationalized coverage of crime incidents involving juveniles and perceived leniency in the justice system compared to other local news outlets, with 53 percent of stories about crime in Baltimore published from January to June 2024 being focused on juveniles and that 80 percent of the outlet&#x27;s crime stories asserted that citywide youth crime rates were rising. This is despite city youth only making up about five percent of arrests in the city and actual juvenile crime data showing a mix of trends, but overall favorable long term trends toward juvenile crime. The report also alleged that reporters associated with WBFF and the Sinclair Broadcast Corporation engaged in bullying toward state legislators, with lawmakers reporting being chased to their cars &quot;by media persons confronting them about a fictitious youth crime wave narrative that often relied on the repetition of sensationalized stories lacking the basics of sound reporting&quot;.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;

&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WBFF shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 45, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 46, using virtual channel 45.

WBFF announced in September 2015 that test broadcasts would begin in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., for ATSC 3.0 (dubbed &quot;Futurecast&quot;) via a two-transmitter SFN with one transmitter in each city on UHF 43 delivering 4K UHDTV and mobile feeds to viewers. This station, named WI9XXT, began experimental broadcasts on August 24, 2015, and the special temporary authority ended on February 25, 2016. WI9XXT&#x27;s broadcasts were from WRC-TV&#x27;s tower in the northwest section of Washington, and from WBFF&#x27;s tower in Woodberry, Baltimore.

As a part of the repacking process following the 2016–2017 FCC incentive auction, WBFF relocated to UHF channel 26 in 2020.

<text>WNUV (channel 54) is a television station in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, affiliated with The CW. It is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting, which maintains a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of Fox/MyNetworkTV affiliate WBFF (channel 45), for the provision of programming and certain services. However, Sinclair effectively owns WNUV, as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. Sinclair also operates TBD affiliate WUTB (channel 24) under a separate shared services agreement with Deerfield Media. The stations share studios on 41st Street off the Jones Falls Expressway on Television Hill in the Woodberry neighborhood of north Baltimore; WBFF and WNUV are also broadcast from the same tower on the hill.

WNUV began broadcasting on July 1, 1982. During the day, it ran specialty programming from the Financial News Network, which was subsidized by its nighttime broadcast of Super TV, a subscription television service that operated in the Washington and Baltimore areas. Super TV peaked at 30,000 Baltimore subscribers in August 1983, but even though the city of Baltimore was late to be wired for cable, the industry suffered a national decline in the mid-1980s, and WNUV ceased airing Super TV on March 31, 1986. In preparation for its closure, the station had begun to recast itself as a general-entertainment independent station as early as 1984. The founding owner and namesake, New-Vision, Inc., sold the station to ABRY Communications in 1989; ABRY upgraded the transmitter and increased the station&#x27;s visibility with a campaign allowing residents to vote on programming choices.

ABRY attempted to sell WNUV to Glencairn, Ltd.—a forerunner to Cunningham, owned by former Sinclair employee Edwin Edwards and the mother of the Smith children that controlled Sinclair—in 1993. The deal was met with public scrutiny, and though it initially fell apart, ABRY signed an LMA directly with Sinclair in 1994 before transferring the license to Glencairn the next year. WNUV affiliated first with UPN in 1995 before switching to The WB in a group deal in 1998 and The CW upon those two networks&#x27; merger in 2006. The station aired a WBFF-produced early evening newscast from 1997 to 2005; for most of its history since Sinclair began programming channel 54, it has been used as a test bed for television transmission technologies.

==History==
===Early years: Super TV===
There had been several expressions of interest in Baltimore&#x27;s ultra high frequency (UHF) channel 54 in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Two applications were considered for the channel in 1967, and the Zamoiski Company held a construction permit for channel 54 as WUHF-TV in the early 1970s. However, it was not until June 23, 1977, when New-Vision, Inc. tendered for filing an application for channel 54, specifying possible use for subscription television (STV) programming. New-Vision found itself in competition with Peter and John Fellowship, owners of Christian FM station WRBS-FM, which had filed by late 1978. The latter group dropped out, leaving New-Vision uncontested for the channel and resulting in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granting the firm a construction permit in June 1979. From the name of the company, channel 54 took the call letters WNUV. Also signed before the station was built was a contract that would have seen the station broadcast Wometco Home Theater as its subscription service.

Construction of the station&#x27;s tower in Catonsville began in April 1982, ahead of a July 1 launch. The independent station aired syndicated reruns and the Financial News Network during the day leading into the subscription service Super TV at night and on weekend afternoons. Super TV was already in business in Washington, where its scrambled programs had been airing on WCQR since November 1981. The star attraction on Super TV was a package of Baltimore Orioles baseball games. For a $20 decoder deposit, a $49 installation charge, and a $19 monthly service fee (plus an optional package of late-night adult movies), subscribers could watch the Orioles, special events, and 70 movies a month. Super TV&#x27;s entry in the Baltimore market convinced competing independent WBFF (channel 45) to abandon its plans to pursue subscription programming despite receiving FCC approval, and it also accumulated 30,000 subscribers in Baltimore (alongside 55,000 more in greater Washington) within a year of starting up. The ad-supported portion of the station also experimented with some local programming, such as a daily newsmagazine, &quot;Say Baltimore&quot;, that aired in 1984.

However, as the early 1980s progressed, subscription television would experience headwinds nationally due to a recession and the development of cable television in major cities. As early as January 1984, WNUV general manager Mark Salditch realized that Super TV likely was not going to be around much longer and began preparing the station for a future without subscription programming. For the 1984–85 television season, channel 54 overhauled its daytime schedule to be more typical for a general-entertainment independent, and the station launched a promotion campaign to make viewers aware that it offered more than subscription programming. One element of the revamped channel 54 was a series of &quot;Pet of the Day&quot; station IDs featuring the dogs, cats, and birds of regional viewers, an idea taken from KTZO in San Francisco.

In October 1985, Subscription Television of Greater Washington, which owned Super TV, announced it would cease broadcasting over WCQR in Washington at year&#x27;s end and retune subscribers&#x27; equipment to receive WNUV if they fell within its coverage area. However, the number of subscribers continued to fall rapidly, from 28,000 in late 1985 to 14,000 in early 1986. As a result of the company&#x27;s failure and WNUV&#x27;s desire to become a full-time commercial independent, Super TV broadcast for the last time on March 31, 1986.

===Going full-time independent===
With Super TV no longer broadcasting, WNUV overhauled its evening programming and made aggressive moves in an effort to become what Salditch called &quot;the Cadillac of independents&quot;. Later that year, the station picked up &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, an NBC program not cleared by WMAR-TV; the program had previously aired on WBFF, which dropped Carson to make room for &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;.

New-Vision sold WNUV to a company formed by Boston investors Andrew Banks and Royce Yudkoff in a deal announced in December 1988. Banks and Yudkoff formed ABRY Communications—named from their initials. The FCC approved of their purchase in March 1989, and the new owners embarked on a campaign to upgrade the station&#x27;s transmitting equipment; the power levels that had been adequate for specially designed antennas as an STV station were insufficient for typical over-the-air receiving equipment. In addition, ABRY moved its corporate headquarters to Baltimore. ABRY also aimed to capitalize on WBFF&#x27;s commitment to the expanding Fox network to case channel 54 as Baltimore&#x27;s only true independent station. It launched a campaign allowing the public to vote on programs for its schedule, a promotional tool successful enough that ABRY duplicated it in relaunching KSMO-TV in Kansas City in 1991.

In 1994, WNUV picked up the broadcast rights to some Baltimore Orioles games produced by Home Team Sports. The station showed Orioles games through 2006, sharing what ultimately was a package of 65 over-the-air telecasts with WJZ-TV; only WJZ-TV carried games in 2007. From 1993 to 1994, the station aired &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in lieu of WBAL-TV, which declined to carry the show.

===Sale to Glencairn, Ltd.===
In August 1993, ABRY announced that it had sold two stations—WNUV and WVTV in Milwaukee, the latter of which it managed and held an option to buy—to Edwin &quot;Eddie&quot; Edwards, who already owned WPTT in Pittsburgh. The deal concerned some in the broadcasting industry. Edwards had a close connection to Sinclair Broadcast Group; he had previously worked for the company, and in Pittsburgh, Edwards brokered most of WPTT&#x27;s broadcast day to Sinclair. The move represented some turnabout given that two years prior, when Edwards bought WPTT so that Sinclair could purchase Pittsburgh Fox affiliate WPGH-TV, ABRY had filed through a third party a petition to deny on the transaction, alleging that Sinclair exercised continued control by way of seller financing. It had explicitly done so through counsel in fear that Sinclair would retaliate by encouraging program suppliers to bypass WNUV in favor of WBFF. In addition, some program syndicators fretted that possible Sinclair combinations such as WBFF–WNUV gave the company excessive leverage over the buying of syndicated shows in those markets.

Scripps-Howard Broadcasting, owner of Baltimore station WMAR-TV, filed a petition to deny on the transfer of WNUV to Edwards in October. It charged that Edwards and Carolyn Smith ( Cunningham), the mother of the four Smith brothers that owned Sinclair, were being used by the brothers as a vehicle to create what in essence would be a duopoly—ownership of two TV stations in a market—which at the time was not allowed by the FCC. It cited the structure of the proposed buyer&#x27;s parent company. While Edwards was the only voting shareholder in Glencairn, Ltd., 70 percent of the non-voting shares in the firm were held by Carolyn Smith, and Scripps&#x27;s petition to deny also pointed to prior business dealings between her and Sinclair as well as to a proposed local marketing agreement (LMA) to allow Sinclair to manage WNUV&#x27;s affairs. The Scripps petition was dismissed by Edwards as an attempt to set up roadblocks to Black ownership of broadcasters and as retaliation for a 1991 challenge by the Smiths to WMAR-TV&#x27;s broadcast license.

The original application for Glencairn to purchase WNUV was withdrawn in April 1994, but ABRY continued to express interest in selling the station to Sinclair. ABRY then signed an LMA directly with Sinclair for WNUV and WVTV, concurrently with the company selling two stations outright to the firm. With the LMA in place, Scripps ultimately decided that continued protest was pointless and dropped its objection to a revised version of the sale, leading to WNUV becoming a Glencairn property.

===Affiliations with UPN and The WB===
WBFF–WNUV management opted to affiliate channel 54 with the United Paramount Network (UPN) over The WB when both networks began in January 1995 because UPN had more conventional affiliation agreements, specifying network compensation payments, than The WB. That network was forced to settle for coverage on local cable systems and a low-power UHF station, Towson State Television.

However, on July 21, 1997, Sinclair signed an affiliation agreement with The WB to switch the affiliations of WNUV and four other UPN affiliates to the network. The move put UPN on the back foot; the network contested the validity of the action in Maryland courts, where it lost twice. WNUV became a WB affiliate on January 18, 1998. One of UPN&#x27;s corporate parents, United Television, acquired home shopping outlet WHSW (channel 24) and hastily relaunched it as UPN affiliate WUTB to give the network a continued presence in Baltimore.

The relationship between Sinclair and Glencairn received renewed attention in 1999, when the company sought to acquire more stations and the FCC detected contradictions in its financial representations. By this time, Edwards only owned three percent of Glencairn&#x27;s equity, with the rest being held by Carolyn Smith and trusts for the benefit of her grandchildren. In December 2001, Sinclair was fined $40,000 by the FCC for illegally controlling Glencairn. Sinclair filed to acquire WNUV outright from the company, renamed Cunningham Broadcasting, in 2002; it attempted again in 2003, when it appeared that the FCC would remove a restriction only allowing new duopolies in markets with more than eight independent TV station owners (which Baltimore lacked).

In 2006, The WB and UPN were shut down and replaced with The CW, which offered programming from both predecessor networks. However, Sinclair was late to sign an agreement with the network. The news of the merger resulted in Sinclair announcing, two months later, that most of its UPN and WB affiliates would join MyNetworkTV, a new service formed by the News Corporation, which was also owner of the Fox network; the core stations for this effort were Fox&#x27;s UPN stations, including WUTB. It was not until May 2, 2006, that Sinclair entered into a deal to affiliate WNUV and five other stations it operated with The CW.

===Testing new technologies===
Since the late 1990s, Sinclair has used WNUV as a testing ground for new television transmission technologies. Sinclair was the first Baltimore broadcaster to start airing digital simulcasts of its stations, with WBFF and WNUV both beginning digital broadcasts on February 27, 1998. WNUV&#x27;s analog signal on UHF channel 54 was shut down on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 40, using virtual channel 54.

In July 2009, Washington, D.C.-area TV stations became a test market for Mobile DTV, and WNUV was one of the participating stations.

WNUV received FCC authorization in 2013 to begin conducting tests of the OFDM-based DVB-T2 terrestrial television standard and other future television broadcast standards, with the aim of identifying the feasibility of next-generation standards for mobile device usage and 4K ultra HD; the experimental broadcasts began on the morning of March 27, 2013. The tests ran between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. and did not interrupt cable reception; the lost programs were aired on a subchannel of WBFF.

As a part of the repacking process following the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction, WNUV was reassigned to UHF channel 25 and was to relocate by March 2020. Because it did not have to wait for any other stations to move first, WNUV moved to channel 25 on September 1, 2018, to allow new spectrum licensee T-Mobile to begin operations.

WNUV&#x27;s signal became the Baltimore market&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) lighthouse station on June 24, 2021. As required by FCC rules, WNUV&#x27;s existing ATSC 1.0 channels relocated to other stations in the market to preserve service to existing ATSC 1.0 receivers. In November 2022, Sinclair signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korean automaker Hyundai for development of ATSC 3.0 technologies in the automotive industry; WNUV began broadcasting information to support a demonstration of an in-car entertainment platform being conducted at a Hyundai dealership in Baltimore.

==Newscasts==

WNUV launched a 6:30 p.m. newscast in March 1997 called &quot;UPN 54 News at 6:30&quot; (changed to &quot;WB 54 News at 6:30&quot; in January 1998). The newscast shared the same news set and anchors as WBFF&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast; the idea of news in this evening time slot had been first floated in 1995. In January 2005, Sinclair replaced WNUV&#x27;s 6:30 p.m. newscast with a new half-hour early evening newscast on WBFF, airing at 5:30 p.m. weeknights.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
WNUV offers four subchannels, which are broadcast under hosting arrangements by four Baltimore TV stations. Uniquely, the main CW subchannel is broadcast from two Maryland Public Television transmitters: WMPT (Annapolis) with virtual channel 54.1, and WMPB (Baltimore) with virtual channel 54.11. This is a quirk resulting from FCC rules which require any ATSC 3.0 station to use channel-sharing to maintain ATSC 1.0 service of its primary subchannel to 95% of its previous coverage area; WNUV could not reach a channel-sharing agreement with any in-market station which provides adequate coverage due to capacity limits, and it was found that neither MPT station alone reached the threshold.

===ATSC 3.0 lighthouse service===
In turn, WNUV broadcasts most of the market&#x27;s major stations in ATSC 3.0 format:

<text>WGGB-TV (channel 40) is a television station in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, affiliated with ABC, Fox, and MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Gray Media alongside low-power CBS affiliate WSHM-LD (channel 33). The two stations share studios on Liberty Street in Springfield; WGGB-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Mount Tom in Holyoke.

==History==
The station signed on April 14, 1953, as WHYN-TV, broadcasting an analog signal on UHF channel 55. It was the second television station to launch in the Springfield market, debuting one month after NBC affiliate WWLP (channel 61, now on channel 22). WHYN-TV was founded by Hampden-Hampshire Corporation, the owners of WHYN radio (560 AM and 93.1 FM); the stations were in turn jointly owned by the owners of the &quot;Holyoke Transcript-Telegram&quot; and the Northampton-based &quot;Daily Hampshire Gazette&quot;. In 1954, a 50% interest in Hampden-Hampshire Corporation was purchased by the employees beneficial funds of the Springfield &quot;Republican&quot; and &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;Springfield Union&quot; for $250,000.

WHYN-TV originally operated as a primary CBS affiliate with a secondary affiliation with DuMont; it lost DuMont when that network folded in 1956. During the late-1950s, it was also briefly affiliated with the NTA Film Network. It moved to channel 40 on September 30, 1957, in order to give the station a closer dial position to other UHF stations in the region. However, on November 16, 1958, WTIC-TV (channel 3, now WFSB), a station in the nearby Hartford market that had previously been an independent station, switched to CBS, prompting WHYN to petition the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unsuccessfully for a VHF channel; in 1959, channel 40 became an ABC affiliate. WTIC-TV then became the CBS affiliate of record in Springfield; over the years, channel 3 would block several attempts by channel 40 to switch from ABC back to CBS.
Guy Gannett Broadcasting Services (not to be confused with the Gannett Company) announced in October 1966 that it would purchase the WHYN stations for $4 million; the acquisition was completed in 1967. The WHYN radio stations were sold off in 1979; Guy Gannett retained WHYN-TV, and on December 31 the station took its present WGGB-TV call letters.

Most of Guy Gannett&#x27;s television stations, including WGGB, were acquired by the Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1998. In late-July 2007, Sinclair sold WGGB to locally based Gormally Broadcasting for $21.2 million. The sale closed on November 2, resulting in WGGB being the only locally owned television station in the market. In addition to WGGB, Charter systems offer fellow ABC affiliate WCVB-TV from Boston on channel 23 (Comcast does not offer such access).

On June 18, 2014, the Meredith Corporation (owner of WFSB in Hartford) announced that it would acquire WGGB creating a duopoly with low-power CBS affiliate WSHM-LD. Although FCC broadcast ownership rules normally forbid same-market ownership of two of the four highest-rated television stations (based on monthly total-day ratings), which often constitute stations affiliated with the four major broadcast networks (the Springfield market has only three full-power television stations, too few to allow a duopoly in any normal circumstance), the deal is permissible under FCC rules which allow common ownership of full-power and low-power television stations (the respective class designations of WGGB and WSHM) in all markets. The sale was completed on October 31, 2014. This reunited WGGB with MyNetworkTV affiliate KSMO-TV in Kansas City, Missouri, which Meredith acquired from Sinclair in 2005.

On September 8, 2015, Media General announced that it would acquire Meredith for $2.4 billion, with the combined group to be renamed Meredith Media General once the sale was finalized. Because Media General already owns WWLP, and the Springfield-Holyoke market does not have enough full-power television stations to legally allow a duopoly in any event (WGGB and WWLP are the only full-power licenses assigned to the market), the companies would have been required to sell either WGGB or WWLP to comply with FCC ownership rules as well as recent changes to those rules regarding same-market television stations that restrict sharing agreements had the sale gone through. WSHM-LD was the only one of the three stations affected by the merger that could legally be acquired by Meredith Media General, as FCC rules permit common ownership of full-power and low-power stations regardless of the number of stations within a single market. However, on January 27, 2016, Nexstar Broadcasting Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Media General, resulting in the termination of Meredith&#x27;s acquisition by Media General.

On May 3, 2021, Gray Television announced its intent to purchase the Meredith Local Media division for $2.7 billion. The sale was completed on December 1.

==WGGB-DT2==
WGGB-DT2, branded as Fox 6 for its primary cable channel slot, is the primary Fox and secondary MyNetworkTV-affiliated second digital subchannel of WGGB-TV, broadcasting in high definition on channel 40.2.

WGGB-DT2 first became active under Sinclair&#x27;s ownership as part of their nationwide deal with music video network The Tube (a 24-hour digital music channel) from 2005 until the end of 2006, when multiple issues, including The Tube&#x27;s refusal to add E/I programming within its national schedule, had the Tube pulled from all of Sinclair&#x27;s stations; the network went dark at the end of October 2007. It never attained any cable carriage under that guise, and the subchannel was vacated for over a year.

Meanwhile, the market did not have a Fox affiliate of its own, with Springfield being the largest television market in the United States to hold this distinction. For most of Fox&#x27;s first two decades, WTIC-TV in Hartford was Fox&#x27;s affiliate of record for the Pioneer Valley. Depending on the location, cable companies carried either WTIC (which was available over the air in extreme southern portions of the market) or WFXT from Boston (which was owned by the network at the time), while WXXA-TV from Albany, New York was (and still is) also available over-the-air in the market&#x27;s western Berkshires region. At one point, new Class A station WFXQ-CD, owned by WWLP owner LIN Media, had been rumored as attempting to affiliate with the network (hence the station&#x27;s call letters).

As Fox&#x27;s NFC-focused NFL coverage did not include the majority of the games of the New England Patriots outside two NFC-hosted games per year and Super Bowl appearances, and WTIC usually did carry those games, it was not a priority for the network to attain a Springfield affiliate until it discontinued the Foxnet cable service in 2006, and Fox began to push for at least a subchannel presence in every television market in order to obtain profitable retransmission consent revenue from affiliate agreements arising from cable and satellite provider carriage of their channels.

On March 31, 2008, WGGB (by then locally owned by Gormally Broadcasting) officially launched WGGB-DT2 as Springfield&#x27;s first in-market Fox affiliate. Almost immediately, WTIC was substituted on Comcast systems with WGGB&#x27;s Fox subchannel on cable channel 6 (thus giving the subchannel its branding), and as a result, moved to the digital tier on channel 292. Charter eventually followed suit as well placing WTIC on digital channel 261. Comcast eventually removed WTIC to make way for smaller subchannel networks from local stations (including WSHM-LD&#x27;s Cozi TV subchannel and WWLP-DT2 after they acquired The CW affiliation), along with Fox&#x27;s preference for only a market&#x27;s own Fox affiliate to be carried on a pay-TV system.

When WGGB-DT2 signed on for the second time, it also added Fox&#x27;s secondary programming service MyNetworkTV as a secondary affiliation. It is seen in a delayed manner from 12:30 a.m. until 2:30 a.m. early Tuesdays through Saturdays. Outside of default network promotional advertising (which makes no mention of it being programmed by MyNetworkTV), the service airs unbranded on WGGB-DT2. New Haven, Connecticut-based MyNetworkTV affiliate WCTX lost all of their carriage in the Springfield market as a result. It is currently the only affiliate of the service in the Commonwealth, as Boston&#x27;s WSBK-TV (which is carried on Comcast systems throughout the market) disaffiliated from the network in the fall of 2022.

==Programming==
In 2004, Sinclair prohibited WGGB and its other ABC affiliates from airing a &quot;Nightline&quot; broadcast that featured a segment in which then-host Ted Koppel read the names of those who died in the Iraq War; Sinclair viewed the reading as anti-war rhetoric against the invasion. Along with 20 other ABC affiliates (including Boston&#x27;s WCVB), WGGB also preempted an unedited 2004 broadcast of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, which was eventually determined not to be a violation of the FCC&#x27;s indecency guidelines. Until April 2007, the station did not carry &quot;World News Now&quot; from ABC News in the early weekday morning hours, choosing instead to air programming from the Home Shopping Network and later its broadcast sub-network, America&#x27;s Store, which ended operations in April 2007. Preemptions of network programming ended immediately upon Gormally&#x27;s assumption of ownership, and Meredith and Gray have maintained the same hands-off policy outside rare breaking news/weather situations, such as the 2011 tornado outbreak which directly hit downtown Springfield.

===News operation===

WWLP has traditionally been the most watched station in the Pioneer Valley according to Nielsen ratings. However, there have been brief periods of time when WGGB was the market leader and extended periods in which the two outlets were essentially neck-and-neck with WWLP having a slight edge. Originally, WGGB&#x27;s newscasts were known as &quot;NewsWatch 40&quot;. The station cut back financially under Sinclair ownership, and during that period, rumors of canceling &quot;ABC 40 News&quot; or converting to Sinclair&#x27;s controversial, now-defunct centralcasting &quot;News Central&quot; format sometimes spread.

The station ultimately retained its news operation, though it did carry &quot;The Point&quot; segment of conservative political commentary from Mark Hyman which was required to be carried by all Sinclair stations with a local news operation, which was discontinued by Hyman&#x27;s decision in December 2006. In fall 2006, WGGB re-hired Ed Carroll to be its chief meteorologist; he had previously been at the station from 1989 to 1993 before moving to WBZ-TV in Boston.

After becoming locally owned-and-operated, WGGB&#x27;s news department underwent significant changes. Several prominent on-air personnel resigned or were laid off. The station debuted a brand new set, graphics theme, and music package on April 24, 2008. On September 8, WGGB-DT2 added a 10 p.m. newscast known as &quot;Fox 6 News at 10&quot;; this half-hour newscast originally featured a separate graphics package and music theme from the main WGGB broadcasts. Eventually, it was expanded to weekends and became known as &quot;ABC 40 First on Fox&quot;.

On February 13, 1994, a WGGB video crew taped a heated confrontation between Temple University head basketball coach John Chaney and University of Massachusetts Amherst head coach John Calipari at a post-game press conference, where at one point, Chaney had made a death threat against Calipari. The footage (which was watermarked with a digital on-screen graphic showing the station&#x27;s identification) was picked up by ESPN and has since been shown thousands of times. The incident was ranked the second-biggest outburst in sports history by Fox Sports Net&#x27;s &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; in 2006.

On April 6, 2009, WGGB&#x27;s weekday morning show became a full two-hour broadcast like most other ABC affiliates. WGGB-DT2 simulcasts this program, replaying it in full during &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. Later, it was expanded to 4:30 a.m. in concert with most stations in the Northeast expanding their morning newscasts, the first to do so in the Springfield market. The station shares content with the wire services of ABC and Fox NewsEdge, and locally maintains news shares with WCVB-TV and WFXT in Boston for the eastern part of the state. With the acquisition of WSHM-LD, additional partnerships with CBS Newspath and WBZ-TV are also a part of &quot;Western Mass News&quot;″ sharing agreements.

On September 14, 2011, WGGB officially became the first station in the Springfield market to upgrade local news production to high definition level (shows seen on WGGB-DT2 were included with the change). On September 15, 2014, WGGB&#x27;s weekday noon newscast was expanded to an hour.

Following Meredith&#x27;s purchase of WGGB, the news operations of WGGB and WSHM-LD were merged under the &quot;Western Mass News&quot; branding on April 21, 2015; the combined news operation is based out of WGGB&#x27;s facilities. As a result of the merger, WGGB and WSHM simulcast the weeknight 6 p.m. and nightly 11 p.m. newscasts; in addition, WGGB inherited WSHM&#x27;s partnership with the Springfield &quot;Republican&quot; and MassLive.

In delay situations where one station is carrying sports or extended entertainment programming in prime time (for instance, WGGB is carrying NBA coverage or &quot;Saturday Night Football&quot; or the CBS lineup is delayed on WSHM on Sunday nights during the NFL season), one station carries that night&#x27;s newscast live, with the other station airing that same broadcast in full on a tape delay immediately after their prime time ends. On weekend early evenings, a newscast being produced is dependent on either WGGB-DT1 or WSHM carrying network sports coverage. On nights where WGGB-DT2 carries extended coverage from Fox Sports (including prime time college football, boxing, or baseball coverage), only the 11 p.m. newscast is produced and broadcast on WGGB-DT1 and WSHM, then aired delayed on WGGB-DT2 at the end of the Fox sports event.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WGGB-TV upgraded its over-the-air digital signal to allow the transmission of ABC network programming in high definition on October 15, 2004. The station planned to discontinue regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 40, on December 1, 2008, though it left the air a few days earlier than planned after the transmitter suffered a failure. The station also accelerated its analog closedown to facilitate the relocation of its digital channel from its pre-transition UHF channel 55, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to its analog-era UHF channel 40. Channel 55&#x27;s spectrum was reassigned for use by Qualcomm&#x27;s MediaFLO system until later being sold to AT&amp;T Mobility for mobile service spectrum.

<text>WGME-TV (channel 13) is a television station in Portland, Maine, United States, affiliated with CBS. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which provides certain services to Waterville-licensed Fox affiliate WPFO (channel 23) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Cunningham Broadcasting. However, Sinclair effectively owns WPFO as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The two stations share studios on Northport Drive in the North Deering section of Portland; WGME-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Brown Hill west of Raymond. The station also maintains regional studios in the Lewiston–Auburn area, and the state capital in Augusta.

==History==

The station&#x27;s first broadcast was on May 16, 1954, as WGAN-TV, owned by Guy Gannett Communications (no relation to the Gannett Company or its television spinoff, Tegna, which owns WCSH, channel 6) along with WGAN (AM 560) and the &quot;Portland Press-Herald&quot; daily newspaper. (An FM station, 102.9 WGAN-FM was added in 1967.) The transmission tower, situated near Route 121 in Raymond, was built during 1959. It was, according to the 1999 &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, the world&#x27;s tallest architectural structure at the time. This record was surpassed in 1960 by KFVS-TV&#x27;s tower in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, but the tower remained the tallest structure in Maine until the construction of WMTW&#x27;s tower in 2002.

When the radio stations were sold to Taylor Communications of Maine during 1983, the WGAN call letters remained with them; WGAN-TV became WGME-TV, &quot;We&#x27;re Gannett of Maine&quot;, on January 1, 1984.

Motivated by the impending expiration of the family trust that owned the company and a seller&#x27;s market for broadcasting properties, Guy Gannett Communications put itself up for sale in 1998, ending 110 years of its history as a publisher. The Seattle Times Company acquired Guy Gannett&#x27;s newspapers, while the firm&#x27;s television stations were purchased by Baltimore-based Sinclair Broadcast Group for $310 million, a handsome return on family patriarch Guy Gannett&#x27;s original investment in WGAN radio 60 years earlier. The Guy Gannett purchase gave Sinclair diversification into affiliates of the Big Three networks and beyond a portfolio heavy with Fox, WB, and UPN stations.

WGME owner Sinclair Broadcast Group and Time Warner Cable disputed the terms of their retransmission consent agreement that expired on December 31, 2010. The agreement was extended to January 14, 2011, while the parties continued to negotiate. An agreement in principle to resolve the dispute followed soon thereafter and was finalized in February 2011.

On January 8, 2016, Sinclair announced that American Sports Network would begin on January 16 as a dedicated digital-multicast network in 10 cities, including Portland on WGME.

==News operation==

Historically associated with a newspaper, channel 13&#x27;s newscasts dominated the ratings in Portland for many years. However, since 1989, WCSH overtook WGME and has dominated in the ratings. WGME produced 24 hours and 30 minutes of produced news content every week, including early-morning, noon, afternoon drive-time, and late-night news programs. WGME also produced 17 hours of weekly news content for partner station WPFO. When taking both stations into account, WGME produced the most local news content in the Portland market, though its primary station carries the least amount of local news content among the market&#x27;s three major network affiliates.

Former news team for &quot;Live at 5&quot; and &quot;News 13 at 6&quot;, Kim Block and Doug Rafferty were a news team from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s. Kim Block is one of the most recognized television journalists in both the Portland market and in the State of Maine/New Hampshire. Block has been the lead anchor at WGME for more than three decades, starting in 1981 until her retirement in 2020, recovering from a concussion in May 2018. Rafferty reduced his reporting hours after suffering a stroke during a live cut-in of a syndicated program on January 19, 2006, quitting the anchor desk for a behind-the-scene technical job at the station. He retired during 2012 to become the Public Relations and Education Head at the Maine State Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Other longtime anchors include weeknight announcer Gregg Lagerquist and morning announcer Jeff Peterson. Sports anchor and director Dave Eid has been with WGME since 1996. Longtime meteorologist Charlie Lopresti has been with the station for more than a decade.

Starting February 5, 2007, WGME began producing a 10 p.m. newscast on Fox affiliate WPFO after establishing a news-share agreement. Known on-air as &quot;Fox 23 News at 10&quot;, it is the first prime-time broadcast in the market; as of September 2018, there is now a half-hour 10 p.m. newscast on CW affiliate WPXT (channel 51). During 2010, due to a revenue-share agreement with WPFO, the station expanded this newscast to an hour and began a two-hour-long morning program on WPFO named &quot;Good Day Maine&quot;. WPFO pays WGME a fee along with a share of revenue realized from the newscast. &quot;Good Day Maine&quot; was shortened to one hour by October 2013.

The station began a news partnership with Maine Today Media, owner of its former newspaper sisters: the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot;, &quot;Kennebec Journal&quot;, &quot;Morning Sentinel&quot;, and &quot;Maine Sunday Telegram&quot;. In addition to its main studios, WGME operates a Lewiston–Auburn Bureau. A second bureau is in Augusta near the Maine State House. News 13 also has a partnership with the &quot;Lewiston/Auburn Sun Journal&quot;, using the source very frequently for stories in the twin cities. WGME also shares newsgathering material with WPFO, gaining WGME access to both CBS Newspath and Fox News video footage for the use of all newscasts on both WPFO and WGME. WGME meteorologists provide the weather forecasts for the &quot;Portland Press Herald&quot;, the &quot;Maine Sunday Telegram&quot;, and a variety of radio stations in the Portland market. When providing regional and state coverage, WGME and ABC affiliate WVII-TV in Bangor share content and video footage.

WGME does not produce local weekend morning newscasts, unlike the NBC and ABC affiliates in the Portland market. Instead, it broadcasts infomercials or E/I (educational and informational) children&#x27;s programming early on weekends. For national news, the station carries the CBS News-produced &quot;CBS Saturday Morning&quot; and &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;.

On October 31, 2013, station owner Sinclair Broadcasting bought all non-license assets of WPFO Fox 23 for $13.6 million. The licensing assets were sold to Cunningham Broadcasting on November 20, 2013, for $3.4 million. Cunningham Broadcasting closed business relationships with Sinclair in stations around the country. The sale made WPFO a sister station of WGME, essentially creating an unofficial duopoly in the Portland market.

On September 11, 2017, WGME launched a half-hour 7 p.m. weeknight newscast. The opportunity came about as a result of CBS Television Distribution&#x27;s decision to cancel &quot;The Insider&quot;, which had previously aired on WGME in the 7:30 p.m. weeknight time slot.

===Transition to HD===
WGME began broadcasting in 720p high definition (HD) on December 18, 2011, with a new wood-styled set designed by Devlin Design Group. WGME&#x27;s new HD set included video display monitors on either end of the set for anchor stand-up reporting, a 12-monitor video wall used to display a single panoramic video feed or 2, 3, or 12 individual video feeds. A smaller anchor desk at the video wall is used for WPFO broadcasts &quot;Good Day Maine&quot; and &quot;News 13 on FOX&quot; at 10 pm. The anchor desk included a large monitor behind the anchors which typically showed a skyline image or the News 13 logo. The entire set included an array of light panels and light boxes. The weather office is fully visible to viewers, with a small desk for the meteorologist above which a four-monitor video wall could show graphics. There was also a traditional green screen and a forecasting system on a raised platform for live reporting of severe weather. The HD newscasts introduced a new graphics package also used by Sinclair station WZTV.

WGME&#x27;s newscasts were referred to as &quot;CBS 13 News&quot; as of April 2013. The newscasts on WPFO were referred to as &quot;FOX 23 News&quot; as of February 2014.

On February 28, 2013, WGME&#x27;s weather department rolled out new graphics to its Weather Central forecasting system, as part of a new graphics package from parent company Sinclair Broadcasting. It is slowly being introduced on other Sinclair stations.

In early 2014, while WGME-TV CBS 13 News received a new graphics package now seen on-air, &quot;News 13 Daybreak&quot; changed its name to &quot;Good Day Maine On CBS 13&quot;. On September 15, 2014, WPFO-TV premiered the WGME-produced &quot;Fox 23 News @ 6:30 pm&quot; featuring the combined (6 p.m. and 11 pm) anchor team and a new format.

<doc id="628364" wikidata="Q312302" url="?curid=628364" title="Paolo Borsellino">
<text>Paolo Emanuele Borsellino (; ; 19 January 1940 – 19 July 1992) was an Italian judge and prosecuting magistrate. From his office in the Palace of Justice in Palermo, Sicily, he spent most of his professional life trying to overthrow the power of the Sicilian Mafia. After a long and distinguished career, culminating in the Maxi Trial in 1986–1987, on 19 July 1992, Borsellino was killed by a car bomb in Via D&#x27;Amelio, near his mother&#x27;s house in Palermo.

Borsellino&#x27;s life parallels that of his close friend Giovanni Falcone. They both spent their early years in the same neighbourhood in Palermo. Though many of their childhood friends grew up in the Mafia background, both men fought on the other side of the war against crime in Sicily as prosecuting magistrates. They were both killed in 1992, a few weeks apart. In recognition of their tireless effort and sacrifice during the anti-mafia trials, they were both awarded the Gold Medal for Civil Valor. They were also named as heroes of the last 60 years in the 13 November 2006 issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

== Early life ==

Borsellino was born in a middle-class Palermo neighbourhood, Kalsa, a neighbourhood of central Palermo which suffered extensive destruction by aerial attacks during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. His father was a pharmacist and his mother ran a pharmacy in the Via della Vetriera, next to the house where Paolo was born. As boys Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone – later a magistrate, who was born in the same neighbourhood – played football together on the Piazza Magione. The Mafia was present in the area but quiescent. Both had classmates who ended up as &quot;mafiosi&quot;. The house where he was born was declared unsafe and the family was forced to move out in 1956. The pharmacy remained, while the neighbourhood around it crumbled.

Borsellino and Falcone met again at Palermo University. While Borsellino tended towards the right and became a member of the &quot;Fronte Universitario d&#x27;Azione Nazionale&quot; (FUAN), a right-wing university organization affiliated with the neo-fascist Italian Social Movement, Falcone drifted away from his parents&#x27; middle-class conservative Catholicism towards communism. However, neither joined a political party, and although the ideologies of those political movements were diametrically opposed, they shared a history of opposing the Mafia. Their different political leanings did not thwart their friendship. Both decided to join the magistrature.

Borsellino obtained a degree in law at the University of Palermo, with honours, in 1962. After his father&#x27;s death, he passed the judiciary exam in 1963. During those years, he worked in many cities in Sicily (Enna in 1965, Mazara del Vallo in 1967, Monreale in 1969). After he married in 1968, he transferred to his native Palermo in 1975 together with Rocco Chinnici, where he got involved in the investigation into Sicilian Mafia.

== First Mafia investigations ==

Neither Borsellino nor Falcone had intended to get involved in the struggle against the Mafia. They were assigned cases involving the Mafia that continued to expand and became disturbed by what they discovered. They saw colleagues murdered fighting the Mafia and it became increasingly impossible to turn back.

One of his accomplishments was the arrest of six Mafia members in 1980, including Leoluca Bagarella, the brother-in-law of Mafia boss Salvatore Riina. His close co-investigator, Carabiniere captain Emanuele Basile, was murdered by the Mafia the same year. Borsellino was assigned to investigate the murder and became a special target when he signed the arrest warrant for Francesco Madonia on a charge of ordering the murder of Basile. He was assigned police protection.

== Antimafia Pool ==

During those years, working together with magistrates Falcone and Chinnici, Borsellino continued his research about the Mafia and its links to political and economic powers in Sicily and Italy. He became part of Palermo&#x27;s Antimafia Pool, created by Chinnici. The Antimafia pool was a group of investigating magistrates who closely worked together sharing information to diffuse responsibility and to prevent one person from becoming the sole institutional memory and solitary target. The group consisted of Falcone, Borsellino, Giuseppe Di Lello and Leonardo Guarnotta.

In 1983, Rocco Chinnici was killed by a bomb in his car. His place in the Antimafia Pool was taken by Antonino Caponnetto. The group pooled together several investigations into the Mafia, which would result in the Maxi Trial against the Mafia starting in February 1986 and which lasted until December 1987. A total of 475 mafiosi were indicted for a multitude of crimes relating to Mafia activities. Most were convicted and, to the surprise of many, the convictions were upheld several years later in January 1992, after the final stage of appeal. The importance of the trial was that the existence of Cosa Nostra was finally judicially confirmed.

In 1986, Borsellino became head of the Public Prosecution Office of Marsala, continuing his personal campaign against the Mafia bosses, in the most populated city of the province of Trapani. His links with Falcone, who remained in Palermo, allowed him to cover the entirety of Western Sicily for investigations. In 1987, after Caponnetto resigned due to illness, Borsellino was the protagonist of a great protest about the unsuccessful nomination of his friend Falcone as head of the Antimafia Pool.

== Last months ==

On 23 May 1992, Falcone, his wife and three police bodyguards were killed by a bomb planted under the highway outside of Palermo. Giovanni Brusca later claimed that &#x27;boss of bosses&#x27; Salvatore Riina had told him that after the assassination of Falcone, there were indirect negotiations with the government. Former interior minister Nicola Mancino later said this was not true. In July 2012, Mancino was ordered to stand trial on charges of withholding evidence on 1992 talks between the Italian state and the Mafia and the killings of Falcone and Borsellino. Some prosecutors have theorized that Borsellino was killed because he had found out about the negotiations.

Borsellino failed to get himself appointed to the investigation into Falcone&#x27;s murder. At a public meeting on 25 June 1992, he said that he had certain information which might explain why Falcone was killed. Borsellino unofficially asked Carabinieri Colonel Mario Mori to resume a previous investigation by Falcone into Mafia control of public works contracts. However, Mori, unbeknownst to Borsellino, was involved in secret meetings with Vito Ciancimino, who was close to Riina&#x27;s lieutenant Bernardo Provenzano. Mori was later investigated on suspicion of posing a danger to the state after it was alleged he prevented the arrest of Provenzano and had taken a list of Riina&#x27;s demands that Ciancimino had passed on. He maintained he had spoken to Ciancimino to further investigation of the Mafia, that Ciancimino had disclosed little beyond implicitly admitting he knew Mafia members, and that key meetings were after Borsellino&#x27;s death. In 2014 Italy’s president, Giorgio Napolitano, testified in a trial in which 10 defendants including the former interior minister, Nicola Mancino, were accused of negotiating with the Mafia.

On 17 July 1992, Borsellino went to Rome where he was told by Gaspare Mutolo, a Mafia member turned informer, of two allegedly corrupt officials: Bruno Contrada, former head of Palermo Flying Squad, now working for the secret service (SISDE), and anti-Mafia prosecutor Domenico Signorino. Borsellino considered Signorino a friend and was deeply troubled by the allegation. He was further disconcerted when the meeting was interrupted by a call from the Minister of the Interior, Nicola Mancino, requesting his immediate presence. Borsellino attended to discover that Contrada was there, and knew about the supposedly secret meeting with the informer.

== Death ==

On 19 July 1992, Borsellino was killed by a car bomb in Via D&#x27;Amelio, near his mother&#x27;s house in Palermo, less than two months after the death of his friend Falcone in the Capaci bombing. The bomb attack also claimed the lives of five police officers: Agostino Catalano, Walter Cosina, Emanuela Loi (the first Italian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty), Vincenzo Li Muli and Claudio Traina.

In his last video interview, given on 21 May 1992 to Jean Pierre Moscardo and Fabrizio Calvi, Borsellino spoke about the possible link between Cosa Nostra&#x27;s mafiosi and rich Italian businessmen such as future Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The interview received little coverage on Italian television; as of 2007, it has been broadcast only once, and that by a satellite channel RaiNews 24 in 2000, in an abridged version of 30 minutes rather than the original 50 minutes.).

Dozens of mafiosi were sentenced to life imprisonment for their involvement in Borsellino&#x27;s murder.

=== Legacy ===
Borsellino today is considered as one of the most important magistrates killed by the Sicilian Mafia and he is remembered as one of the main symbols of the battle of the State against the Mafia. Many schools and public buildings were named after him, including Palermo International Airport (subsequently renamed &quot;Falcone-Borsellino Airport&quot;) – a memorial by local sculptor Tommaso Geraci is there – and the Velodromo Paolo Borsellino multi-use stadium in Palermo. In recognition of their efforts in the anti-Mafia trials, he and Giovanni Falcone were named as heroes of the last 60 years in the 13 November 2006 issue of &quot;Time&quot;.

His sister Rita ran as centre-left coalition (The Union) presidential candidate in the 2006 Sicilian regional election, after having won the regional primary election, but lost to incumbent Salvatore Cuffaro, who was later sentenced to seven years in prison for collusion with the Mafia.

His famous quote about Sicily, &quot;she will become most beautiful&quot;, is the namesake of the Diventerà Bellissima party.

<text>WSMH (channel 66), branded on-air as Fox 66, is a television station licensed to Flint, Michigan, United States, serving as the Fox affiliate for northeastern Michigan. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which provides certain services to Saginaw-licensed NBC affiliate WEYI-TV (channel 25, owned by Howard Stirk Holdings) and Bay City-licensed CW affiliate WBSF (channel 46, owned by Cunningham Broadcasting) through separate shared services agreements (SSAs). However, Sinclair effectively owns WBSF as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith.

The three stations share studios on West Pierson Road in Mount Morris Township (with a Flint mailing address); WSMH&#x27;s transmitter is located on Amman Road (near Gary Road) near St. Charles, Michigan. There is no separate website for WSMH; instead, it is integrated with that of sister station WEYI-TV.

==History==
Flint Broadcasting Limited Partnership requested a station with the call letters WSMH, which were assigned on September 27, 1984. WSMH first went on the air on January 13, 1985, as an independent station with Frederick (Fritz) Mills as general manager. Mills was formerly director of national sales, UPI Media in Chicago. A fire at the transmitter in April 1985 forced the station to go off the air for about one month until repairs could be made. Flint Broadcasting sold the station to Gerald J. Robinson by July 1986. On October 9, 1986, it became a charter Fox affiliate. Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the station in 1996.

Per a new five-year affiliation agreement reached between Sinclair and Fox on May 15, 2012, WSMH would remain a Fox affiliate until at least December 31, 2017, although currently, its Fox affiliation remains to this day.

==News operation==

Sinclair announced numerous layoffs at WSMH/WEYI in March 2023, which led to a major cut in news production from the stations. As of April 15, 2023, WSMH presently broadcasts just five hours of locally produced newscasts each week, only airing an hour-long show at 10 p.m. WSMH no longer produces local weekend news.

On October 28, 2002, WSMH started up a news department and began airing local broadcasts every night at 10. Called &quot;Fox 66 News at 10&quot;, it was assisted by Sinclair&#x27;s centralized news department under the &quot;News Central&quot; brand. Local news originated from WSMH&#x27;s studios while national news, weather, and sports aired from &quot;News Central&quot; headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland. The station was the first Sinclair-owned property to use the &quot;News Central&quot; service and marked the first time it had ventured into the local news market. In January 2006, Sinclair announced plans to end its &quot;News Central&quot; operation due to low ratings and expense.

On April 10, Sinclair announced that CBS affiliate WNEM-TV would begin producing a nightly 10 o&#x27;clock show on WSMH known as &quot;TV 5 News at 10 on Fox 66&quot;. This began airing on April 24 from WNEM&#x27;s studios on North Franklin Street in Downtown Saginaw. After the final &quot;News Central&quot; broadcast on April 21, many local WSMH news employees were laid off. It had been expected that some personalities would join the WNEM-produced newscast in the future according to a press release. This was the case for former WSMH reporter David Custer who joined the WNEM news team on May 3.

The final &quot;News Central&quot; broadcast featured, in its last few minutes, clips from past shows. At the end, the studio was darkened and Jim Kiertzner and his boss left for the last time. Even after WSMH shut down its news operation, Mark E. Hyman&#x27;s controversial &quot;The Point&quot; editorials continued to air following the end of the WNEM-produced newscasts. Hyman ended his commentaries on November 30. On May 1, 2009, the 10 o&#x27;clock news title was re-branded and the broadcast received updated graphics. Every night at 10:45, a fifteen-minute sports highlight show called &quot;Sports Extra&quot; airs. There is also a segment called &quot;Fugitive Files&quot; airing every week on Mondays which is a common segment offered by local news departments operated by Sinclair. Although WNEM upgraded its newscasts to 16:9 enhanced definition widescreen on October 14, 2010, the newscasts on WSMH remain in pillarboxed 4:3 standard definition because this channel lacks a modern master control facility at its separate studios to receive the newscast in widescreen.

Effective April 27, 2015, WEYI took over duties of producing the 10 p.m. newscast for sister Sinclair station WSMH, &quot;Fox 66 News at 10&quot;. Prior to April 27, WNEM-TV produced WSMH&#x27;s evening newscast as part of a local agreement with WSMH. &quot;Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson&quot;, a Sinclair Broadcast Group produced half-hour investigative news program, airs on the channel on Sunday morning starting October 4, 2015.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

On September 30, 2006, WSMH began broadcasting The Tube on its secondary subchannel.

In late 2010 and early 2011 with new carriage deals by owner Sinclair, WSMH added two music video networks to its digital subchannels, TheCoolTV on 66.2 and The Country Network on 66.3.

In late August 2012, TheCoolTV was dropped from all 32 Sinclair stations that carried the channel, including WSMH, with no replacement due to non-renewal of affiliation. Sinclair signed an agreement in June 2014 which added GetTV to 33 TV markets with WSMH adding that channel on channel 66.2 effective July 2.

Zuus was replaced on WSMH-DT3 by Comet on October 31, 2015. In December of that year, the station replaced GetTV with Antenna TV.

On October 30, 2023, Stadium was replaced on WSMH-DT4 by a new Sinclair owned TV network called The Nest.

=== Analog-to-digital conversion ===
WSMH discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 66, on May 21, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 16, using virtual channel 66.

<doc id="628366" wikidata="Q1378330" url="?curid=628366" title="Joe Hall (ice hockey)">
<text>Joseph Henry &quot;Bad Joe&quot; Hall (May 3, 1881 – April 5, 1919) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. Known for his aggressive playing style, Hall played senior and professional hockey from 1902 to 1919, when he died as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic. He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Quebec Bulldogs and once with the Kenora Thistles, and became hospitalized while participating in the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals, which were cancelled on April 1, six hours before the deciding game and four days before he died.

==Career==
Hall was born in Milwich in Staffordshire, England. He moved with his family to Canada in 1884, initially going to Winnipeg, Manitoba before settling in Brandon, Manitoba. Details of Hall&#x27;s life before 1902 are otherwise scarce.

Nicknamed &quot;Bad Joe&quot; for his aggressiveness on the ice, he played in the Manitoba Hockey Association (MHA) with the Brandon Wheat City Hockey Club, Winnipeg Rowing Club and Kenora Thistles between 1902 and 1907, and in the first fully professional league, the International Professional Hockey League (IHL), where he was a teammate of Cyclone Taylor on the Portage Lakes Hockey Club during the 1905–06 season. Between 1907 and 1909 he played for the Montreal Shamrocks, Montreal Hockey Club and Montreal Wanderers in the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA), after having been expelled from the MHA in December 1907 for rough play.

Between 1910 and 1917 Hall played in the National Hockey Association (NHA) as a member of the Quebec Bulldogs. On the Bulldogs he formed a successful defence pairing with Harry Mummery. He played for the Montreal Canadiens in their first two seasons in the National Hockey League from 1917 to 1919, after having been claimed from Quebec in the Dispersal Draft in November 1917.

Hall won the Stanley Cup with the Kenora Thistles in 1907, as a spare player, for which he received a loving cup which is on display in the Hockey Hall of Fame. He won the Stanley Cup with the Quebec Bulldogs in consecutive years in 1912 and 1913. He also challenged for the Stanley Cup in 1904 with the Winnipeg Rowing Club, losing over three games to the Ottawa Hockey Club.

===1919 Stanley Cup Finals===

In 1919, Hall was part of the Montreal Canadiens team that made it to the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals. The Finals were interrupted, with the two clubs having won two games each, and were cancelled on April 1, six hours before the deciding game, due to an outbreak of Spanish flu. The flu was contracted by several players on both the Canadiens and their opponents, the Seattle Metropolitans. Hall eventually succumbed to pneumonia, related to his influenza, in a hospital in Seattle, Washington, just four days after the series was abandoned.

Hall was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1961.

==Playing style==
Hall, a right-handed shot, started out his playing career as a forward, playing predominantly as a right winger. During the 1905–06 season with the Portage Lakes Hockey Club he scored 33 goals in 20 games in the International Hockey League from the right wing position. During the second half of his career he played as a defenceman. A &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; article from December 20, 1931 by Harold C. Burr, interviewing former player Lester Patrick, described Hall as a &quot;fast hard-riding forward in the old days of seven-man hockey&quot; and as a &quot;scoring defense man, too, and a hard blocker.&quot; The article described further how Hall was &quot;built like a tomcat, with long arms and legs.&quot;

Hall had a reputation as one of the roughest and dirtiest players of his era, which earned him the moniker &quot;Bad Joe&quot;, and he was involved in several instances of violence where he was reprimanded for attacking either opposing players or officials. On December 19, 1907, at the onset of the 1907–08 season, while playing for the Winnipeg Maple Leafs in an qualifying test game against the Winnipeg Hockey Club, Hall was involved in a contest which was dubbed a &quot;disgraceful exhibition&quot; by the &quot;Winnipeg Tribune&quot;, and the newspaper singled out Hall as the chief offender regarding violent displays. The game ended when the Winnipeg Hockey Club refused to continue playing, thus defaulting the game. The most blatant act of violence happened when he knocked down Charlie Tobin with his stick. Hall was subsequently expelled from the MHA along with Maple Leafs teammate Harry Smith.

During the inaugural NHA season in 1910, while playing for the Montreal Shamrocks in a game against the Cobalt Silver Kings, Hall attacked referee (and former Montreal Wanderers player) Rod Kennedy which prompted the NHA to expel him from the league, although he was later reinstated. Three years later, during the 1912–13 NHA season, he was again involved in a violent situation with an official as he kicked referee Tom Melville on the shins and later swung his stick against him.

During the inaugural NHL season in 1917–18, while a member of the Montreal Canadiens, Hall was involved in a violent tussle with Alf Skinner, forward of the Toronto Arenas, during a game on January 28, 1918. Both players were arrested for assault and appeared in a Toronto court together on January 29 where both were released after being handed a suspended sentence.

Cy Denneny, a longtime left winger with the Ottawa Senators who played directly against (right defenceman) Hall in the NHA and NHL, claimed in an interview with Bill Westwick of the &quot;Ottawa Journal&quot; in December 1945 that Hall, despite his reputation as a dirty player, &quot;was a friendly fellow also&quot;, off the ice. Denneny claimed that Hall had told him that he did not like opposing players who tried to avoid him by shifting sides, but that he had never been dirty towards Denneny because he came in on Hall&#x27;s side minding his own business.

<doc id="628369" wikidata="Q3191350" url="?curid=628369" title="KDNL-TV">
<text>KDNL-TV (channel 30) is a television station in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, affiliated with ABC. Owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, the station maintains studios at the University Tower in the suburb of Richmond Heights and a transmitter in Shrewsbury.

Channel 30 in St. Louis was sought on several occasions in the 1950s and early 1960s, though no station materialized. The fourth attempt to build the channel was originally spearheaded by a group of local investors as well as Washington attorney John Dean; after the construction permit for KDNL-TV was sold to Thomas Mellon Evans, the station began broadcasting on June 8, 1969. It served as the second independent station for the St. Louis area, airing syndicated reruns as well as financial news and sports. Cox Broadcasting purchased KDNL-TV in 1981, in part because it held a permit for over-the-air subscription television broadcasting. Cox launched this service in June 1982, but it was a business failure, and Cox shut it down in February 1983. The station continued to be an overall money-loser and a misfit in the Cox station portfolio, even though it became the first local affiliate of Fox in 1986.

Barry Baker and Larry Marcus, former executives of rival independent KPLR-TV who were fired for trying to buy that station, purchased KDNL-TV from Cox in 1989. It became the first station in a St. Louis-based company eventually known as River City Broadcasting, which soon acquired other independent and Fox-affiliated stations. Ratings and revenue improved with the success of the Fox network, with total viewership approaching KPLR-TV, and led the station to start a local news department in January 1995. Under a deal announced in 1994 but carried out in August 1995, KDNL-TV lost its Fox affiliation and switched with KTVI to become the affiliate of ABC in St. Louis.

In 1996, River City merged into Sinclair Broadcast Group. However, KDNL&#x27;s news department failed to gain traction, hurt by the traditionally poor ratings for ABC programming in the market; high turnover in news talent; a lack of full-day news service; and the resistance to change of many St. Louis viewers. In 1999, Baker left Sinclair and assigned an option to purchase KDNL-TV and six Sinclair-owned radio stations in St. Louis to Emmis Communications; the option resulted in a lawsuit settled with Sinclair retaining the TV station and selling off the radio properties. More critically, it led to neglect of the station&#x27;s transmitter facility, causing signal issues, and the suspension of early evening newscasts for the struggling news operation. In the wake of the advertising slump after the September 11 attacks, Sinclair closed the KDNL-TV news department in 2001 and laid off all 47 staff. Since then, the station has largely been the fourth- or fifth-rated station in the market, with two short-lived and outsourced attempts at local news programming since the 2001 newsroom closure.

==Channel 30 prior to KDNL-TV==
Three different attempts were made to start channel 30 in St. Louis. The assignment was added in 1952 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ended its nearly four-year freeze on new television stations and introduced assignments in the new ultra high frequency (UHF) band. Applications were filed by the Empire Coil Company and the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod for the channel, with the latter receiving the construction permit in February 1953 after Empire Coil withdrew. The church planned to run KFUO-TV as a noncommercial station in conjunction with its existing radio station. While it initially planned an early 1954 start, the station project was said to still be in consideration by February 1954, and the church surrendered the permit for cancellation in January 1956 after finding the potential for a UHF station poor.

In September 1956, the Plaza Radio and Television Company of New York applied for channel 30. Plaza also applied for authority to broadcast subscription television (STV) programming using the proposed station. The FCC indicated it would need to hold hearings to determine whether the channel should be awarded, even though no other group was seeking channel 30, because Plaza held but was not using a permit for channel 26 in San Francisco. This application and another for a station in Detroit were dismissed by the FCC in September 1958.

==Pre-construction==
For the third time, channel 30 in St. Louis was sought when Washington, D.C.–based Globe Television Corporation filed to build the station in June 1964. The two leading stockholders in Globe were lawyers: Vincent B. Welch and Edward P. Morgan of the Washington firm of Welch, Mott &amp; Morgan. Welch had founded the communications law firm in 1946, and Welch and Morgan were applying for new television stations nationwide, including Minneapolis; Columbus, Ohio; and Henderson, Nevada. The Welch–Morgan group was awarded the St. Louis permit and stations in Miami and San Jose, California, in October 1964. Globe Television renamed itself the Continental Summit Television Corporation after the permit was awarded; in June 1965, the company requested an extension of time to build. It stated that the Missouri Pacific Building, its intended transmitter site, was inadequate, as downtown office buildings interfered with the signal in the Illinois portion of the metropolitan area. It also requested that its application be switched from channel 30 to 24, which was inserted as part of a national overhaul of the UHF table of allocations that year.

Boyd Fellows, the former general manager of educational station KETC and assistant to the president of Continental, then left that company to become the president of a new firm seeking channel 30, the Greater St. Louis Television Corporation. Other officers included a Black dentist, Dr. Benjamin F. Davis, and a Washington attorney, John Dean; his then-wife, Karla Hennings, was also a stockholder. Dean had participated in the formation of Greater St. Louis Television Corporation in January, while he was still employed by Welch &amp; Morgan; when the firm found out about the work, it dismissed Dean for what Welch called &quot;unethical conduct&quot;. Though characterizations of his dismissal varied, one former associate told the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; that he was ordered to leave immediately and not given time to pack up his belongings. This story came to light during the Watergate hearings, during which Dean was a crucial witness as to the cover-up of the Watergate scandal, and was first reported by syndicated columnist Jack Anderson.

The Greater St. Louis Television Corporation received the construction permit for channel 30 on June 7, 1966, and took the call sign KDNL-TV on August 17.

==Evans Broadcasting ownership==
Citing &quot;unanticipated difficulties and unexpected changed circumstances&quot;, the stockholders of Greater St. Louis Television Corporation filed in April 1968 to sell the construction permit to financier Thomas Mellon Evans. The transfer was granted by the FCC in late July. At the time, Evans was in the middle of a push into UHF television, buying dormant construction permits for stations from Dallas to Worcester, Massachusetts.

Under Evans, construction activity finally commenced. The former studios of KMOX-TV at 13th and Cole streets were acquired to house channel 30, while the station was approved to build a tower in Shrewsbury, on land that was part of the Kenrick Seminary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. Louis. In April, a mast began rising on the site.

KDNL-TV debuted on June 8, 1969. Its program schedule was dominated by syndicated reruns of former network shows as well as a daytime financial news program, &quot;TV 30 Financial Observer&quot;. Channel 30 was the first station built by the newly formed Evans Broadcasting Corporation, which had plans to start activating additional stations. KDNL-TV trailed the established independent station in the St. Louis market, KPLR-TV, and had less than half of its audience share as of July 1972.

In 1977, KDNL added coverage of St. Louis Blues hockey road games, which aired through the 1980–81 season; after that, the games moved to KSDK (channel 5).

Evans made one attempt at expanding the reach of KDNL-TV deeper into Illinois. In June 1979, a subsidiary company, Southern Illinois Broadcasting Corporation, was granted the permit to build channel 13 at Mount Vernon, Illinois, for which it had filed two years prior. However, the Evans proposal attracted protests from southern Illinois residents who feared the channel would merely be used to rebroadcast KDNL-TV programming and wanted to see a full-fledged local station for their area. A farmer in Salem, Illinois, went as far as to refuse to lease her land for transmitter site construction when she learned of Evans&#x27;s plans for channel 13. Though Evans had secured another site and even shipped the tower to Salem to be erected, the FCC responded to the residents&#x27; concerns by rescinding the permit grant in November 1979. In February 1980, citing the potential for years of litigation, it withdrew its attempt to build channel 13.

In April 1976, Evans Broadcasting applied for authority to broadcast over-the-air subscription television (STV) programming using KDNL-TV. The application languished because another company, Midwest St. Louis, had filed for channel 24 and proposed the same type of programming, and at the time the FCC only permitted one STV station per market. Despite that, the possibility of reaching the large, then-uncabled St. Louis market with pay TV programming excited interest from buyers in the STV space. Time Inc., which through its American Television and Communications unit had cable and pay TV operations, entered into negotiations to purchase the station from Evans. Evans reached an agreement to sell the station to Buford Television, a Texas company in the process of moving into subscription programming with stations such as WBTI in Cincinnati, in September 1979. With that sale pending, in February 1980, the FCC granted subscription authority to KDNL-TV. Though the FCC granted the Buford deal on April 30, the agreement was withdrawn on May 8.

==Cox Broadcasting ownership==
Evans announced in March 1981 that he had sold KDNL-TV for $13.2 million to Cox Broadcasting, which at the time owned no UHF stations and only one independent, KTVU in Oakland, California. Upon completing the purchase in January 1982, Cox announced its plans to debut subscription television service on the station later in the year, once it had acquired sufficient equipment and personnel to handle the new operation. Cox Broadcasting president William A. Schwartz believed that the service could be viable even if just 15 to 20 percent of residents signed up for it, citing the large market and relatively low cable penetration. Beginning on June 1, 1982, KDNL-TV replaced its prime time and late night lineup with Preview, a subscription service featuring first-run movies and late night adult programming. Subscribers paid $24.90 a month plus a $49.95 installation fee.

Preview failed in St. Louis due to poor economic conditions and a lack of sports rights (though seven St. Louis Cardinals baseball games were telecast), in addition to a faster-than-anticipated wiring of the area for cable. In October, the company began aggressively discounting installation fees for new subscribers, causing it to lose money for every subscriber that signed up for Preview. Amid losses estimated at $100,000 a month and with just 10,000 households signed up, Cox announced in December 1982 that it would cease subscription television service on February 28, 1983. The Preview operation also hurt the station&#x27;s ability to sell commercial advertising; advertisers were put off by the lost ad inventory and adult programming. Michael S. Kievman told a panel at the 1983 conference of the Association of Independent Television Stations (INTV) that he had received comments like &quot;No one watches you, you&#x27;re not really a TV station.&quot;

Emerging from Preview, Cox invested $2 million in updating the station&#x27;s facilities. Blues hockey returned to the station, though it moved to KPLR-TV in 1986. KDNL-TV became a charter affiliate of Fox at its launch in October 1986. However, at the outset, Fox programming was little help for the station, which in May 1987 was tying KETC in the critical early evening period and was being beaten by KPLR by a factor of six-to-one. The network&#x27;s flagging &quot;The Late Show&quot; with Joan Rivers was pulled from KDNL-TV&#x27;s schedule two months before its cancellation.

==River City Broadcasting ownership==
===Building a media group===

In the fall of 1988, two former senior executives of KPLR-TV owner Koplar Communications—Barry Baker and Larry Marcus—formed Better Communications Inc. to acquire television and radio stations. They first offered to buy KPLR-TV and were then fired by company president Ted Koplar. Instead, their first purchase was KDNL, acquired from Cox. In selling channel 30, Cox Broadcasting president Stanley G. Mouse noted that the station &quot;[did] not fit the profile of our other television stations&quot;, which included five network affiliates plus two independents in larger markets (KTVU and WKBD-TV in Detroit), all of which broadcast local news; another Cox source noted that the station had been a money-loser for Cox, in part because of the failed Preview service in 1982–1983. At the time of the purchase, KDNL had a total sign-on to sign-off share of five percent, trailing KPLR at 11 percent.

For Barry and Marcus, the purchase of KDNL-TV was the first act in the construction of a broadcasting group. In May 1989, a deal was struck to acquire KABB, an independent station in San Antonio, Texas, under the name River City Television Partners, which came to represent the entire group. The firm then expanded into radio broadcasting when it acquired St. Louis radio station KSTZ out of bankruptcy in 1990. River City changed the call letters and branded the station as &quot;The Fox&quot;, a complement to his Fox affiliate. With the addition of the radio station, the company became River City Broadcasting (RCB).

KDNL finally took flight under River City ownership. Within a year, aided in part by the introduction of meters to measure ratings, the station doubled its total-day audience share from five to eleven percent, narrowly behind KPLR, as well as its revenue. By December 1993, it was the fourth highest-rated Fox affiliate in the nation, with an intensive focus on children&#x27;s programming, counterprogramming the other stations, and Fox network programming. The 1994 edition of its Fox 30 Kids Fair, featuring guest appearances by two Power Rangers, attracted more than 50,000 attendees.

In February 1994, River City announced it would take the next step in growing KDNL-TV by starting a local half-hour 9 p.m. newscast to air beginning in early 1995. General manager Gregg Filandrinos credited the decision to start a newscast to Fox&#x27;s acquisition of National Football League television rights. Renovation work estimated at more than $3 million began later that year to add news facilities to the channel 30 studios.

===Affiliation switch to ABC and launch of local news===

The arrival of NFL football to Fox, however, also triggered a massive realignment in television station affiliations which began in earnest on May 23, 1994, when New World Communications announced it would switch 12 of its stations affiliated with ABC, CBS, and NBC to Fox. Included were three stations New World had just agreed to acquire from Argyle Television, including KTVI, the then-ABC affiliate in St. Louis. With KTVI switching to Fox, the ABC affiliation was now open. KSDK and KMOV, the two strongest stations in the market, both were in long-term agreements with their respective networks. This left two primary contenders: KPLR and KDNL, plus home shopping station WHSL (channel 46). Though KPLR was the stronger-rated independent and a VHF station unlike KDNL, it was heavily committed to sports with contracts for Cardinals baseball and Blues hockey games that would lead to significant preemptions of network prime time programming, and it had also signed on to affiliate with The WB when it launched in 1995. The sports preemptions hurt KPLR in its negotiations with ABC.

On August 26, 1994, ABC announced that KDNL-TV would become its St. Louis affiliate beginning in mid-1995. Once that took place, KDNL-TV planned to scale up its nascent news operation to a level befitting a &quot;Big Three&quot; affiliate. The already-planned 9 p.m. newscast would shift to 10 p.m. and be joined by new 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts. The agreement was concurrent with a renewal for two of the three ABC stations River City was buying at the time: WSYX-TV in Columbus, Ohio, and WLOS in Asheville, North Carolina. The third station, KOVR in Sacramento, California, was excluded because it was losing its ABC affiliation to a station owned by the Belo Corporation.

In its last months with Fox, on January 1, 1995, KDNL began airing a 9 p.m. newscast, &quot;News 30 Now&quot;. It was the first new television newsroom in St. Louis since KPLR went on the air in 1959 and heavily relied on talent from elsewhere. Of the station&#x27;s anchors and reporters, only one was already working in the market—the station&#x27;s public affairs director, who doubled as the weekend anchor. The on-air talent came from stations as far away as Winnipeg, Orlando, and Spokane, Washington. Unlike other startup newsrooms of the period at Fox affiliates, KDNL shied away from an offbeat, edgy style in favor of a more straightforward news presentation.

In addition, KDNL began airing &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in overnight hours in 1995 after becoming a secondary affiliate of UPN. KDNL dropped UPN programming in January 1998, leaving the network without a St. Louis affiliate until 1999, when Christian station KNLC briefly began airing some of its programming.

KDNL-TV became the new ABC affiliate in St. Louis on August 7, 1995, with its level of network programming increasing from 35 to 85 hours a week. KDNL aired all ABC programming that KTVI had aired but maintained KTVI&#x27;s preemption of the soap opera &quot;Loving.&quot; Fox Kids programming did not immediately move to KTVI; KNLC stepped in to pick up the shows, but issues over signal quality and replacement of commercials with public service announcements (including urging children to protest an execution), plus the size of the Fox Kids Club in St. Louis, the nation&#x27;s largest, resulted in the children&#x27;s block moving to KTVI in September 1996.

Immediately upon the switch, &quot;News 30&quot; moved from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. and debuted a 6 p.m. edition. The station also signed Don Marsh, a veteran St. Louis news anchor who had left KTVI the year before, to anchor its newscasts.

==Sinclair Broadcast Group ownership==
===Purchase of River City===
On April 11, 1996, River City announced that it would merge with the Sinclair Broadcast Group for $2.3 billion, creating a company with 29 television and 34 radio stations nationwide. Barry Baker relocated to Baltimore, where Sinclair is headquartered, and remained with the combined company as the president and chief executive officer of its broadcasting division. At the time, KDNL-TV was unsettled in senior management. Original news director Gary Whitaker had left to run a TV station in Springfield, Missouri; the general manager then resigned to produce a syndicated talk show. Channel 30 was described by insiders as adrift, poorly rated, and with low morale in the newsroom. Its 10 p.m. newscast was well behind third-place KTVI. Sinclair continued to expand the former River City cluster in St. Louis by adding three radio stations being spun off by Heritage Media in 1997.

However, KDNL-TV&#x27;s news efforts gained little traction and were plagued by high turnover as well as a reputation for sensationalized reporting. Tripp Frohlichstein, writing in the &quot;St. Louis Journalism Review&quot;, found the news department insufficiently staffed and the anchor team lacking chemistry; of the station&#x27;s two daily newscasts, he wrote that KDNL-TV &quot;gives the impression that it is not serious about the news&quot;. Don Marsh left the television news business in August 1998 when he failed to come to terms with Sinclair on a contract renewal; he was replaced by Patrick Emory, who had worked for CNN as well as KMOV-TV and KSDK. The other main anchor, Leslie Lyles—who had been with the station since the news department started—exited in 1999 and returned to Charleston, South Carolina, where she had been working prior to joining the KDNL news team. The station had three news directors in less than three and a half years, one of them—David Cohen—resigning in the wake of a racist joke he made at a news meeting. He told a Black reporter proposing a story on heart disease that &quot;anyone who eats fried chicken and mashed potatoes is going to have heart disease&quot;. Gail Pennington of the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; would later comment that the constant changes in on-air personnel were anathema to viewers, noting that &quot;St. Louis doesn&#x27;t like change.&quot; Frohlichstein concurred, writing, &quot;More than most cities, St. Louis viewers stick with what they know.&quot;

===Emmis option dispute===
In February 1999, Barry Baker quit his position at Sinclair, where he was the &quot;heir apparent&quot; to company president David D. Smith, to become the president and chief operating officer of USA Networks. His employment agreement with Sinclair gave him the option to buy back Sinclair&#x27;s media properties in one of two markets—St. Louis or Greenville, South Carolina—if exercised before August 8, 1999. In June, Baker transferred the option agreement to Emmis Communications, an Indianapolis-based radio and television station group that already owned three St. Louis radio stations, which then proceeded to attempt to exercise the agreement to purchase KDNL-TV and Sinclair&#x27;s six local radio stations. 

The manner in which the option agreement was transferred and executed instead led to a legal fight. In January 2000, Sinclair sued Emmis and Baker in its home state of Maryland and charged that the proposed buyer had no rights to acquire the stations, saying the option was too vague to take effect and was not designed to allow a party other than Baker to purchase them. In the lawsuit, Sinclair noted that Emmis asked Sinclair to pay millions of dollars to replace KDNL&#x27;s transmitter and in employee severance costs, as well as to assign its ABC affiliation agreement unchanged to Emmis. The lawsuit was read by one Wall Street analyst as a stalling tactic to allow it to keep the cash flow from the radio stations for as long as possible before selling them. Two months later, Baker and Emmis filed a countersuit against Sinclair, accusing Sinclair of interfering with their agreement and engaging in &quot;gross mismanagement&quot; of the St. Louis stations. In June, Sinclair and Emmis settled the legal actions; Sinclair retained KDNL-TV and sold the St. Louis radio stations, the last ones it owned, to Emmis for $220 million.

The effect of the option agreement dispute was to leave KDNL-TV in a state of limbo and neglect for a year. Maintenance of the station&#x27;s equipment fell off, and after a late 1999 fire affecting the transmission line on its Shrewsbury mast, the transmitter repeatedly failed, forcing KDNL off the air. Because of this and work to install KDNL&#x27;s digital signal, which signed on January 2, 2001, the station operated on severely reduced power, leaving many non-cable homes without KDNL or ABC programming. The news department downsized from 5 and 10 p.m. newscasts, having abandoned the 6 p.m. timeslot in 1996, to just the 10 p.m. edition. While the early report was reinstated in December 2000, it could not regain the viewers it had, with more than twice as many St. Louis-area households watching &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; on KPLR-TV. Despite this turmoil, KDNL shocked industry observers by winning the regional Emmy Award for best large-market newscast.

===Discontinuation of local news===

On September 28, 2001, KDNL-TV general manager Tom Tipton informed the staff and the public that the station would cease airing local news on October 12, laying off all 47 staffers in its newsroom. Tipton cited &quot;the increased competitive landscape and current market conditions&quot; that &quot;made it increasingly difficult to operate a competitive news operation&quot;. Other factors included a negative jolt to advertising revenue compounded by the September 11 attacks and financial trouble within Sinclair itself. At the time, Sinclair was closing down some of its underperforming news departments across the country. In November 2000, it shut down the newsroom at WTWC-TV in Tallahassee, Florida; it also had cut back the newsroom at WXLV-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, before closing it altogether in January 2002. As a result of closing its news department, KDNL-TV became the only Big Four-affiliated station in the 25 largest media markets in the United States not to offer any local news.

Sinclair once again tried to sell the station in June 2002 as part of the company&#x27;s eventually aborted attempt to sell all seven of its ABC-affiliated stations to focus on its Fox and WB stations.

Even without local news, KDNL has largely been among the weakest affiliates of ABC since switching to the network and generally ranks fifth in total ratings. The network&#x27;s difficulty in St. Louis was not new: the market had always been an underperformer for ABC, even when KTVI was the affiliate, though NBC and CBS had higher-than-average viewership.

In 2017, Sinclair entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media, owner of KTVI and KPLR. The two stations were in the top four in ratings, but KDNL was not; Sinclair proposed to own KTVI and KDNL while providing services to KPLR. In February 2018, it amended its proposal to specify a spin-off of KPLR to an independent buyer. On April 24, 2018, the Meredith Corporation, owner of KMOV, announced that it would purchase KPLR-TV for $65 million; the bid was soon scratched amid objections by the Department of Justice, with Sinclair instead proposing to sell KPLR to a divestiture trust. The larger Sinclair–Tribune deal never progressed; after the FCC designated it for hearing by an administrative law judge, Tribune called off the deal and sued Sinclair in August 2018.

===Local news programming since 2001===
====News share agreement with KSDK (2011–2014)====

On January 3, 2011, NBC affiliate KSDK began producing weeknight 5 and 10 p.m. newscasts for KDNL through a news share agreement. The newscasts, known as &quot;STL Now on ABC 30&quot;, were produced at KSDK&#x27;s Market Street studios in Downtown St. Louis and required the hiring of additional personnel. KDNL general manager Tom Tipton stated that the station did not want to run simulcast or repurposed newscasts in its efforts to return daily news broadcasts to the station. The KSDK-produced newscasts on KDNL were pre-taped in advance. There was no sports report featured during the program. The news share agreement between the two stations was quite unusual given the rarity of a Big Three network affiliate producing newscasts for another Big Three station. In this case, KDNL and KSDK competed against one another in both timeslots. Although KDNL only aired local news programming on weekdays, the station did air replays of KSDK&#x27;s entertainment/features program &quot;Show Me St. Louis&quot; on weekends. The agreement with KSDK was to end on December 31, 2013, but it continued into January 2014.

====&quot;The Allman Report&quot; (2014–2018)====
On February 10, 2014, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; reported that the station intended to restart an in-house news department, with 5 and 10 p.m. newscasts slated to be anchored by KFTK (97.1 FM) morning host and former KMOV reporter Jamie Allman. On November 24, 2014, KDNL officially announced that it would launch its new news program, &quot;The Allman Report&quot;, in January 2015. KDNL and Allman described the program as an extension of his radio show, with a conservative, &quot;debate-driven format&quot; that focused on local headlines and issues. &quot;The Allman Report&quot; originated from the studios of Pelopidas in Brentwood rather than from KDNL&#x27;s facilities.

The program continued until April 9, 2018, when it was canceled by KDNL amid calls for a viewer and advertiser boycott. The cancellation took place two weeks after Allman tweeted a message alluding to him wanting to assault 17-year-old David Hogg, a student who was on campus at the time of the Parkland high school shooting, by sodomizing him with a heated fire poker for his gun control activism. Allman was fired from KFTK and took his Twitter account private. Allman was later re-hired by Salem Media Group-owned radio station KXFN in February 2019, though the program was short-lived after KXFN&#x27;s sale to Relevant Radio, which converted it to a Spanish-language Catholic talk format in the fall of the same year. After converting his show to a self-distributed podcast, he now hosts mornings on KTLK-FM (104.9) after iHeartMedia converted that station to a conservative talk format in August 2021.

==Local programming==

KDNL-TV&#x27;s local programming, as of June 2023, includes &quot;City Corner&quot;, a weekly public affairs program; a selection of St. Louis-area church services; and &quot;Them Yo People&quot;, a man-on-the-street interview program produced in St. Louis and also aired in other nearby markets.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KDNL-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 30, on February 17, 2009, the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were scheduled to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (the official date was pushed back to June 12). The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 31, using virtual channel 30.

<text>WUTV (channel 29) is a television station in Buffalo, New York, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside MyNetworkTV affiliate WNYO-TV (channel 49). The two stations share studios on Hertel Avenue near Military Road in Buffalo; WUTV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Whitehaven Road (near I-190) in Grand Island, New York, behind its former main studio building.

Since February 2008, WUTV serves as the Fox network feed received in the Cayman Islands. It joined the Primetime 24 lineup in 2009, serving most of the Caribbean islands. The station is also broadcast in parts of Canada, in particular throughout the adjacent Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, including the Greater Toronto Area.

==History==
WUTV signed on the air on December 21, 1970, as a general entertainment independent station, and its original studios were located at the transmitter site in Grand Island, New York. The station was owned by Ultravision Broadcasting Company, from which the &quot;UTV&quot; in the WUTV callsign originates. Ultravision was owned by Stan Jasinski, who had first applied for the station&#x27;s license in 1963 and also owned Buffalo&#x27;s WMMJ (1300 AM) at the time; shortly thereafter, Jasinski spun off WMMJ to country musician Ramblin&#x27; Lou Schriver, who turned it into present-day WXRL. The WUTV call sign was originally to be used for a station on VHF channel 3 in Indianapolis, Indiana, under the ownership of department store William H. Block Co., which never went on the air; the call sign was later issued to another station in Youngstown, Ohio, with a construction permit on channel 21 that also never launched, with NBC affiliate WFMJ-TV purchasing that permit and moving from channel 73 to the channel 21 allocation that the Youngstown WUTV permit was originally intended to broadcast on.

WUTV was the only independent station in Buffalo for many years; its schedule included cartoons (such as &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and &quot;Yogi Bear&quot;), sitcoms (such as &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;, and &quot;The Munsters&quot;), and sci-fi shows (such as &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, &quot;The Invaders&quot; and &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;), along with classic movies and drama series. It was the first commercially successful UHF station in Western New York; previous efforts on the UHF dial, including WBES-TV (channel 59), WBUF-TV (channel 17), and WNYP-TV (channel 26) all had failed within a few years of their debuts. Ultravision Broadcasting sold the station to Whitehaven Entertainment Corporation in 1977. The station was acquired by Citadel Communications, a Bronxville-based company not related to the larger radio station owner Citadel Broadcasting, in 1984.

On October 9, 1986, WUTV became one of the original charter affiliates of the newly launched Fox network. At the time, Fox only aired late-night programming five days a week, so WUTV was still essentially programmed as an independent station. However, by 1989, WUTV was one of several Fox affiliates nationwide that were disappointed with the network&#x27;s weak prime time programming offerings, particularly on Saturday nights, which were bogging down WUTV&#x27;s otherwise successful lineup. Fox then signed an agreement with WNYB-TV (channel 49, now WNYO-TV) to become its new Buffalo affiliate, and WUTV reverted to being an independent station full-time, effective September 1, 1989.

Ahead of the disaffiliation from Fox, Act III Broadcasting (a company controlled by Norman Lear) offered to buy WUTV, and Citadel accepted. This proceeded by a duopoly waiver from WUHF in Rochester, citing cross-ownership, which was normally not allowed by the FCC, and regularly did not allow a waiver in the process, until 2000 (Act III did apply for a waiver for the station). The sale was finalized in June 1990, and Lear moved WNYB-TV&#x27;s stronger programming to WUTV, in turn bringing the Fox affiliation back to the station. The Buffalo Sabres, who held a minority stake in the new WUTV, which was then sold WNYB-TV to Tri-State Christian Television (Act III was known for such acquisition practices).
On January 16, 1995, WUTV became a secondary affiliate of the upstart United Paramount Network (the UPN affiliation subsequently moved to WNGS (channel 67, now WBBZ-TV) in April 1998, with WONS (channel 21, WVTT-CD) simulcasting WNGS the following year, and then to WNLO (channel 23) in 2003). Later that year, ABRY Partners purchased WUTV and the rest of the Act III Broadcasting stations; the group was then renamed Sullivan Broadcasting. Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired WUTV as part of its purchase of Sullivan in 1998; Sinclair then bought WNYO-TV in 2001, creating a duopoly with WUTV.

Since the 1994 NFL season, WUTV has aired Buffalo Bills games via the &quot;NFL on Fox&quot;; they are given at least two games a season to air, usually when the team plays host to an NFC team at Highmark Stadium; although the station has seen more games aired since 2014 when the NFL instituted cross-flex rules, meaning that games can be arbitrarily moved to the station from WIVB, which airs most of the team&#x27;s games.

After Sinclair came to a retransmission consent agreement in February 2007 nationally with Time Warner Cable, WUTV and WNYO-TV&#x27;s high definition feeds began to be carried locally by the provider. WUTV&#x27;s HD feed was not available on the region&#x27;s other cable provider, Atlantic Broadband, until 2012. The Time Warner Cable agreement was to expire at the end of 2010, and the two companies were late in reaching an agreement. In the event Sinclair had pulled WUTV from TWC, a separate agreement allows Fox programming to be piped in from out of market (likely involving Nexstar Media Group, whose stations have been used as out-of-market superstations in the past to temporarily replace in-market network affiliates displaced due to carriage disputes). This made WUTV particularly vulnerable to a prolonged blackout. It does not produce any local content, serving mostly as a &quot;pass-through&quot; for automated programming. Much of its syndicated programming could be seen on other cable channels (such as TBS, WGN and TVGN), and much of its daytime programming consisted of infomercials. The dispute was resolved without a blackout.
On May 15, 2012, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network&#x27;s affiliation agreement with Sinclair&#x27;s 19 Fox stations, including WUTV, allowing them to continue carrying the network&#x27;s programming until 2017. Grit was added to a subchannel in October–November 2014.

The second subchannel was affiliated with The Country Network until early 2017 when it was announced to be switching over to TBD. On June 1, 2017, both digital subchannels were replaced, 29.2 with the previously announced TBD and 29.3 with Charge!.

==Newscasts==

Until 2013, WUTV did not air news programming, making Buffalo the largest television market in the United States whose Fox affiliate did not offer any newscasts at all (Sinclair is believed to have paid a large fee to Fox to avoid the network&#x27;s mandate that its affiliates carry local news). The station long opted to air syndicated programming instead of carrying news programming, as it is within range of the Toronto market and features advertising targeted at Southern Ontario viewers, along with the large number of stations within the Buffalo market and those receivable in the market from Hamilton and Toronto that already produce local newscasts.

This lack of local news programming ended on April 8, 2013, as the 10 p.m. newscast produced by NBC affiliate WGRZ channel 2 moved from WNYO-TV to WUTV. Along with the move, it was expanded to seven nights per-week, and the station also announced plans to air an encore of the final hour of WGRZ&#x27;s morning show on a one-hour delay. These moves were part of an effort to better compete against the WIVB-produced newscasts in the same timeslots on CW affiliate WNLO—both of which have been historically more successful even though WGRZ has surpassed WIVB in most of its main newscasts. Under the terms of the agreement to carry WGRZ&#x27;s newscasts on WUTV, Sinclair had no editorial control over the newscasts. In addition to carrying WGRZ&#x27;s newscasts, WHAM-TV meteorologists provide &quot;Fox 29 Weather Updates&quot; between programs.

In March 2021, WUTV established a studio to produce content for Sinclair&#x27;s national news programming, such as &quot;The National Desk&quot;. The station does not produce long-form news programming from this studio and continued to carry the WGRZ-produced program in the meantime.

On July 1, 2021, WUTV introduced a new in-house newscast; it used resources from other Sinclair-owned stations in the state of New York, with its anchors based out of WSTM-TV in Syracuse and its weather and sports segments produced from WHAM-TV in Rochester. The program failed to make much of a ratings impression; in the November 2022 sweeps period, the WIVB–WNLO newscast attracted four times as many viewers. As a result, Sinclair discontinued it effective January 27, 2023, with Sinclair&#x27;s national news service, &quot;The National Desk&quot;, airing in its stead. Four people lost their jobs: a news director, two reporters, and a photographer.

===Notable former on-air staff===
* Mike Catalana – sports director (2021–23)
* Maryalice Demler – weeknights at 10 p.m.
* Kevin O&#x27;Connell – chief weather anchor (fired in 2018 due to an endorsement dispute)

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUTV discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 29, at 11:59 p.m. on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later moved to June 12); this made WUTV the first television station in Buffalo to switch to digital. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 14, using virtual channel 29.

As part of the SAFER Act, WUTV kept its analog signal on the air until March 3, 2009, to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters. WUTV, along with PBS member station WNED-TV (channel 17) were the only Buffalo television stations that did not terminate their analog signals on the new June 12 date.

==Canadian coverage==
Up until 2003, Rogers Cable carried WUTV in Ottawa and London, Ontario; that year, Rogers replaced WUTV with Detroit owned-and-operated station WJBK as the Fox station available in these markets. The reason for the switch in Ottawa was twofold. The main reason was that MCI, the company which microwaved U.S. network television signals to Ottawa from Rochester, had decided to discontinue this service (until 2003, the ABC, NBC, and CBS stations available in Ottawa had originated from Rochester). Secondly, Rogers chose Detroit as the new source for U.S. television network signals because Canadian broadcasters were concerned about the increased Canadian advertising revenues that Buffalo stations would attract, were they to receive an expanded viewing audience across Ontario. Since Detroit (which like Buffalo, is located adjacent to a Canadian media market) is a much larger market than either Buffalo or Rochester, advertising prices would be much higher and it would therefore not be economical for Canadian businesses to purchase advertising time on such stations.

Although WUTV was the Fox affiliate available in Ottawa, Rogers decided to switch to WJBK in order to ensure uniformity in the source cities for all U.S. network television signals. Rogers switched to WJBK in the London market because the signal for the CBS affiliate available in London, WSEE-TV (out of Erie, Pennsylvania) was of lower quality than that of Detroit&#x27;s CBS station, WWJ-TV. Hence, Rogers&#x27; London system switched from WSEE-TV to WWJ-TV and, as in Ottawa, decided to switch its Fox affiliate from WUTV to WJBK for source city uniformity for the U.S. network signals. Rogers continues to carry WUTV in both standard and high definition for customers in the Golden Horseshoe, including Toronto.

Cogeco Cable carries WUTV in standard definition for its customers in the Golden Horseshoe, but carries WJBK in high definition. For many years, WUTV was carried on cable in Quebec as far east as Gaspe, and was once carried on cable in Montreal and Montérégie until 1997, when Vidéotron replaced WUTV with WFFF-TV in Burlington, Vermont (the Fox station that signed on the air at the time). Originally, its sister station in Rochester, WUHF, was carried on cable in the Western Montreal suburbs during 1995. Those stations were the first Fox stations to be carried on cable in Montreal. It also returned temporarily when WFFF-TV was off the air for a brief time in the mid-2000s. WUTV was also carried via microwave on cable systems in Central New York, including the towns of Sullivan and Chittenango in the mid 1970s.

Because of its Canadian coverage, the station plays the respective American and Canadian national anthems &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;O Canada&quot; and a display of both countries&#x27; national flags during its sign-off for maintenance on early Monday mornings between 3 and 5 a.m.

<doc id="628373" wikidata="Q7953697" url="?curid=628373" title="WNYO-TV">
<text>WNYO-TV (channel 49) is a television station in Buffalo, New York, United States, affiliated with MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside Fox affiliate WUTV (channel 29). The two stations share studios on Hertel Avenue near Military Road in Buffalo; WNYO-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located on Whitehaven Road (near I-190) in Grand Island, New York.

The construction permit for channel 49 was issued in 1984 and changed hands twice before the station went on the air on September 1, 1987, as WNYB-TV. While TVX Broadcast Group handled much of the station&#x27;s construction, the company made another purchase that forced it to sell the unbuilt WNYB-TV to remain under national ownership limits. Channel 49&#x27;s first owner was Aud Enterprises, a division of the Buffalo Sabres hockey team; channel 49 aired Sabres road games and served as the Fox affiliate from 1989 to 1990. It also lost an average of $1 million a year. In 1990, under a deal brokered the previous year, the Sabres games, Fox programming, and syndicated shows on WNYB-TV moved to WUTV, with Tri-State Christian Television (TCT) buying channel 49 to broadcast Christian programming.

TCT sold WNYB-TV to Grant Broadcasting in 1996; the deal included TCT&#x27;s acquisition of a dormant station on channel 26 in Jamestown, which became the new WNYB. In October 1996, Grant relaunched channel 49 as WNYO-TV, the Buffalo affiliate of The WB. Sinclair purchased the station in 2000, forming a duopoly with WUTV. The station produced its own local newscast from 2004 to 2006 as part of Sinclair&#x27;s News Central service and then aired local news programming produced by Buffalo NBC affiliate WGRZ from 2006 to 2013. WNYO-TV is Buffalo&#x27;s ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) station; in reciprocal arrangements, other Buffalo TV stations broadcast its subchannels on its behalf while it carries them in the new format.

==History==
Channel 49 was added to Buffalo in lieu of channel 76 in February 1966 as part of a national overhaul of UHF channel allocations. The Beta Television Corporation obtained the construction permit that June, but despite attempts to sell the permit to Evans Broadcasting Corporation and New York City&#x27;s WPIX, as well as a call sign change from WBAU-TV to WBBU-TV, the construction permit was deleted in January 1971.

===Permitting===
In 1979, interest coalesced again around channel 49, with applicants investigating the possibility of building a station to broadcast subscription television (STV) programming to paying customers. The first formal application filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) came from Anax Corporation in June. A group of California investors doing business as the Great Erie County Telecasting Corporation made its application in October, followed by Channel 49 Buffalo Television, owned by an investor consortium from Baltimore, the minority-owned Unific Broadcasting Company, and Bison City Television 49, whose principals were primarily from St. Louis.

In 1981, the FCC designated the applications for comparative hearing; an FCC administrative law judge initially dismissed Bison City&#x27;s application because of a failure to establish ownership, but the company successfully appealed. The field thinned considerably when Unific settled with Anax, Great Erie County, and Channel 49 Buffalo Television at the start of the hearing, leaving Unific and Bison City the only contenders for the permit. While Unific believed its local ownership and proposal to feature programming for the Black community in Buffalo made it a superior applicant, administrative law judge Walter C. Miller selected Bison City over Unific; the primary reason was that the latter company had asked for four amendments to its financial qualifications due to an inability to secure financing.

Bison City made some progress at building channel 49; it attempted to secure financing to go on air in 1984, and it even purchased some syndicated programs for the station to air. In 1985, the station secured a tower site in Colden over the objections of some local residents, and Bison City engaged the services of Media Central of Chattanooga, Tennessee, to build the facilities on its behalf, with the call sign WNYB-TV selected.

===TVX: ownership but not operation===
Lacking the financial resources to build the station, Bison City sold 80 percent interest in the WNYB construction permit to TVX Broadcast Group, a chain of independent TV stations, in 1985. TVX proceeded with construction, but a change in its business plan put the station on hold. In November 1986, TVX acquired five major-market independents from Taft Broadcasting. Including the under-construction WNYB-TV but excluding WNRW-TV in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which it was selling, TVX already owned eight stations; the Taft deal put TVX one station over the 12-station limit of the time. TVX announced its intention to sell the WNYB-TV construction permit.

In May 1987, TVX reached a deal to sell WNYB-TV to a subsidiary of the First Allied Corporation, owned by Malcolm Glazer of Rochester. First Allied, in turn, announced that WNYB-TV would begin broadcasting on July 1 from the under-construction studios on Hertel Avenue. However, by late June, the sale to First Allied had fallen through, and the start of the station had been delayed until September to align with the start of the new television season as well as contracts for much of the new outlet&#x27;s programming.

===Sabres ownership===
Needing to dispose of a ready-to-operate television station, TVX reportedly approached the Buffalo Sabres, the city&#x27;s National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, among other groups. By then, the Sabres were the only U.S.-based NHL team whose games still aired on a major network affiliate—NBC affiliate WGRZ (channel 2). Although WGRZ had been the television home of the Sabres for a decade, its interest in renewing the contract waned because it had to preempt NBC programming for Sabres games. The Sabres formed Aud Enterprises (named for Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, popularly known as &quot;the Aud&quot;) as a subsidiary to buy WNYB-TV; the purchase was announced on July 20, 1987. While WGRZ nominally had the right to match channel 49&#x27;s offer to air the Sabres, the franchise deliberately made it difficult for channel 2 to do so by announcing plans to increase the number of televised games from 24 to 29. This cleared the way for the Sabres to effectively take their local telecasts in-house.

Even though Citadel Communications, owner of competing independent WUTV, alleged that Robert E. Rich Jr.&#x27;s minority ownership in the Sabres and two Buffalo radio stations violated cross-ownership rules, the FCC discarded Citadel&#x27;s complaint and approved the transfer to Aud Enterprises on September 1, 1987. This cleared the way for WNYB-TV to sign on for the first time that evening. The deal formally closed in early November. The $4.63 million purchase price represented the value of the property, as construction permits could not be sold at a profit under FCC regulation. In addition to syndicated reruns and movies, as well as the Sabres, WNYB-TV aired broadcasts of Buffalo Bisons minor-league baseball games.

Fox and WUTV had a falling out in 1989 over the network&#x27;s alleged underperformance in Buffalo compared to other markets. Another concern was that CHCH-TV in Hamilton, Ontario, aired Fox programming as well. Channel 29 believed this caused unnecessary duplication because of the proximity of Hamilton to Buffalo and CHCH&#x27;s presence on Buffalo-area cable systems. Additionally, CHCH was able to invoke simultaneous substitution of WUTV during Fox programs it carried, cutting into channel 29&#x27;s ability to sell advertising to its large Canadian audience. Fox moved its programming to WNYB-TV effective September 1, 1989; it did not have the Canadian cable carriage of WUTV and did not depend financially on advertising revenue from Canada. This also left it far less financially lucrative; in two years of operation, WNYB-TV lost an average of $1 million a year, and from launch to April 1990, the team had lost $6 million on the station.

===Consolidation with WUTV; sale to TCT===
In August 1989, Norman Lear&#x27;s Act III Broadcasting moved to purchase WUTV from Citadel. However, it soon put the purchase on hold temporarily to negotiate a second acquisition: that of WNYB-TV&#x27;s programming and facilities from the Sabres. Act III had pulled off a similar station consolidation the year before in Richmond, Virginia, when it bought WRLH-TV as well as the programming inventory of competitor WVRN-TV, which then shut down.

On August 29, 1989, Act III announced that it would buy WUTV along with WNYB-TV&#x27;s programming and Fox affiliation, which would move to channel 29. Simultaneously, the Sabres announced that channel 49&#x27;s transmitting facility would be sold to Tri-State Christian Television (TCT) of Marion, Illinois. In exchange, Sabres owners Seymour Knox and Robert Swados received equity in WUTV and would move their road games from channel 49 to channel 29, where they would have the exposure on Canadian cable systems that WNYB-TV had lacked since launching. The pair of deals would together reimburse the Sabres for their losses in running WNYB-TV. Approval of this set of transactions was not certain since Act III already owned WUHF in Rochester. Both stations&#x27; signals overlapped in Orleans and Genesee counties, and the overlap was large enough that Act III could not buy WNYB-TV without an FCC waiver. In a letter seeking such a waiver, Act III billed the deal as a &quot;consolidation&quot; of WUTV and WNYB-TV. Act III argued that the Buffalo market could not support what were essentially two independent stations due to its &quot;fiercely competitive nature&quot; and the difficulties of UHF broadcasting. It also faced objections from commercial stations WIVB-TV in Buffalo and WROC-TV in Rochester, as well as Stevens Media Services of Buffalo, which decried the monopolizing of the UHF television market and took issue with the overlap between the stations.

In June 1990, the FCC approved the WUTV sale to Act III, granting a one-year waiver to Act III to allow it to sell off WUHF; it had already granted the WNYB-TV sale to TCT in November 1989. WNYB-TV&#x27;s programming, including Fox shows, was immediately merged onto WUTV&#x27;s schedule, and TCT took over channel 49 on June 28, 1990, airing Christian ministry programming.

===Grant ownership===
The structure of the purchase of WNYB-TV by TCT incentivized Tri-State Christian Television to continue the station as a non-profit for five years by including a series of sliding scale payments to the Sabres that increased if the station began accepting commercial advertising or was sold to a commercial broadcaster. With the five years up, in December 1995, TCT made a deal with Grant Broadcasting. The deal would see Grant buy channel 49 from TCT, which would receive $12 million and the construction permit for WTJA (channel 26) in Jamestown, which had last broadcast in 1991.

Speculation immediately pointed to Grant using channel 49 to bring The WB to Buffalo, which was confirmed in June 1996. While TCT began the process of building a new physical plant to bring channel 26 back into service and moved the WNYB call letters there, Grant returned channel 49 to commercial broadcasting as WNYO-TV in October 1996. The Sabres also briefly returned to channel 49, airing a 10-game package simulcast from Empire Sports Network in the 1997–98 season. However, channel 49 could not live up to the O in its new call sign, for Ontario. The Sabres had made the deal in part because the station had hoped to be added to southern Ontario cable systems beginning in January 1998. However, that approval never came. In April 1998, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission denied permission for the companies to add WNYO-TV to their lineups, siding with Toronto stations in finding that the addition of another non-Canadian service would deprive Canadian broadcasters of revenue. Grant Broadcasting expanded its relationship with The WB in 1999, when it ceased airing its programming on Superstation WGN nationally, by obtaining WB secondary affiliations for three of the company&#x27;s other stations.

===Sinclair ownership===

Grant Broadcasting sold WNYO-TV to Sinclair Broadcast Group—the descendant of the original Baltimore group that had sought the channel in 1979—for $51.5 million in 2000. The company had previously reportedly turned down an offer from Granite Broadcasting, owner of ABC affiliate WKBW-TV. This formed a duopoly with WUTV and came after Sinclair had previously backed out of a plan to acquire channel 23 in the city. Unlike with channel 23, in acquiring WNYO-TV, it received an existing station with a building, programming, and staff. The deal also allowed Sinclair to program channel 49 with shows it had purchased with the intent of airing them on channel 23.

In 2006, when The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, Sinclair first elected to affiliate with MyNetworkTV, a new network started by Fox Television Stations, over The CW. On March 2, ten days after the network&#x27;s existence was announced on February 22, Sinclair affiliated 17 stations it owned or managed, including WNYO-TV, with the network.

==Newscasts==
In 2003, WNYO-TV announced it would begin airing a 10 p.m. local newscast utilizing Sinclair&#x27;s hybrid &quot;News Central&quot; format; a local anchor read stories from Buffalo, while national news and weather were provided from Sinclair&#x27;s corporate office in Hunt Valley, Maryland. The hour-long program debuted on August 16, 2004. The primary competition for the newscast was WNLO, which aired a newscast produced by WIVB-TV; WUTV, unlike most Fox affiliates, had not bothered to begin airing local news programming because it aired successful syndicated shows in the 10 p.m. hour. The station had toyed with airing such a program since 2000. The program was later shortened to 30 minutes.

In January 2006, Sinclair ended its standalone news operation at WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh and triggered speculation about the future of the WNYO-TV newscast. The program was then wound down at the end of March, and WGRZ began producing a new half-hour news and sports program for the station in late April. The half-hour consisted of two programs: &quot;2 News on 49&quot;, a 10-minute local newscast recapping the day&#x27;s top stories, and &quot;Western New York Sports Zone&quot;, a 20-minute in-depth sports show. The change brought only a slight improvement in local ratings. The sports portion was later downsized, which did lead to a ratings increase.

The WGRZ-produced newscast moved to sister station WUTV on April 8, 2013, trading places with the reruns of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; that had aired in that time slot on WUTV since the mid-1990s. WNYO-TV continued to air news programming, as a rebroadcast of the 6 a.m. hour of WGRZ&#x27;s morning newscast aired weekdays at 7 a.m. on WNYO-TV, which began on April 8; plans called for this rebroadcast to also move to WUTV at some point in the future. WGRZ continued to produce the newscast for air on channel 29 until July 2021, when Sinclair opted to produce the newscast itself using presentation resources at co-owned stations in nearby markets.

National news and current affairs programming on the station consists of Sinclair-produced &quot;The National Desk&quot; and &quot;Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson&quot; as well as &quot;The Armstrong Williams&quot; Show.

<text>WUHF (channel 31) is a television station in Rochester, New York, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, which provides certain services to dual ABC/CW affiliate WHAM-TV (channel 13) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Deerfield Media. The two stations share studios on West Henrietta Road (NY 15) in Henrietta (with a Rochester mailing address); WUHF&#x27;s transmitter is located on Pinnacle Hill on the border between Rochester and Brighton.

==History==
WUHF began operations on January 27, 1980, as a general entertainment independent station running cartoons, sitcoms (classic and recent), movies, drama series, and religious programs. It was, at the time, the only independent station in the Rochester market.

The station was owned by Malrite and the General Manager was Jerry Carr who was the former &quot;The Weather Outside&quot; personality. Apparently, by sheer coincidence, the station re-used a call sign which was previously used by a different and unrelated station which operated on the same channel 31, albeit in New York City. The latter station had only used the WUHF calls for its first year of experimental operation (1961–62); it is now Ion Television owned-and-operated station WPXN-TV.

In 1983, former underground cartoonist Brian Bram produced and hosted &quot;All Night Live&quot;, a program aired live from midnight to 7 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Bram&#x27;s show was a showcase for regional bands including Personal Effects, Cousin Al and the Relatives, and The Degrads. On October 9, 1986, WUHF became a charter affiliate of Fox for Rochester and was branded as &quot;Fox 31&quot;. Most of the religious shows were gone by then. However, WUHF was initially still programmed as an independent station since Fox would only air one program, &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot; until April 1987, and even then, would not present an entire week&#x27;s worth of programming until 1993. In 1989, Act III Broadcasting bought the station from Malrite Communications Group.

Later that year, Act III Broadcasting bought out WUTV in nearby Buffalo. Because of a city-grade signal overlap (Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules normally prohibit one company from owning two stations with overlapping coverage, and the agency would not even consider a waiver until 2000), Act III applied for a cross-ownership waiver seeking that the two stations were to be co-owned. Act III tried to sell WUHF to a different company after only one year, but no buyer was found. In a group deal, Abry would become the owner in 1995, through Sullivan Broadcasting.

By 1998, it was controlled by Sinclair and was eventually sold to that company, as part of a group deal to purchase Sullivan. In the 1990s, classic sitcoms, movies, and drama shows made way for talk, reality, and court shows. The station ended weekday airings of cartoons at the end of 2001 when Fox canceled its weekday kids block nationwide. In 1999, the station changed its branding to &quot;Fox Rochester&quot; although it adopted a &quot;Fox 31&quot; logo from 1999 to 2005. Its digital signal signed on-the-air in 2004 under a special temporary authority from the FCC.

In August 2005, the Sinclair Broadcast Group entered into a shared services agreement with Nexstar Broadcasting Group, owner of CBS affiliate WROC-TV (channel 8). Sinclair agreed to be the subordinate entity allowing Nexstar to control programming for WUHF. The station then moved from its studios on East Avenue (NY 96) in Rochester to WROC-TV&#x27;s facilities.

On May 15, 2012, Sinclair and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network&#x27;s affiliation agreement with Sinclair&#x27;s 19 Fox stations, including WUHF, allowing them to continue carrying the network&#x27;s programming through 2017.

On December 3, 2012, Sinclair announced it would acquire the non-FCC assets of ABC affiliate WHAM-TV from Newport Television, with the license and other FCC assets being transferred to Sinclair-affiliated Deerfield Media. At the end of 2013, WUHF terminated its SSA with Nexstar and re-located its operations to WHAM-TV&#x27;s facilities in Henrietta.

==Newscasts==

On November 30, 1997, WUHF established its own news department and aired a nightly prime time newscast (originally &quot;Fox News First&quot;; later renamed as &quot;The Ten O&#x27;Clock News&quot;) along with a Sunday night sports highlight show. In 2003, the station adopted Sinclair&#x27;s centralized &quot;News Central&quot; format, which featured locally produced segments, and national segments and conservative commentaries produced from Sinclair&#x27;s studios in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

After WUHF&#x27;s operations were taken over by Nexstar, WUHF replaced &quot;News Central&quot; with the WROC-produced &quot;Fox First at 10&quot; on September 1, 2005. The newscast initially aired for a half-hour; it was later expanded to 45 minutes, with the rest of the hour filled by the sports news segment &quot;Sports Extra&quot;.

On September 4, 2012, WROC-TV became the second Rochester area station to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The 10 p.m. newscast on WUHF was included in the upgrade.

On January 1, 2014, WUHF&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast was taken over by new sister WHAM-TV. WUHF also began to air a morning newscast, &quot;Good Day Rochester&quot;, from 7 to 9 a.m.

===Notable current on-air staff===
*Mike Catalana – sports director; weeknights

===Notable former on-air staff===
*Jenna Wolfe – sports anchor (1998–1999; later with FS1&#x27;s &quot;First Things First&quot;)

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other Rochester television stations:

In 2006, WUHF added The Tube digital music video channel on a new second digital subchannel; the channel was removed when the network went out of business in 2007.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUHF discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 31, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (like most Sinclair stations and was replaced by a &quot;nightlight&quot; loop that ran until March 3). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28, using virtual channel 31.

===ATSC 3.0===

==Cable carriage in Canada==
In 1994, several cable systems in Canada started carrying WUHF via the Cancom communications satellite in out-of-market areas where Fox was not otherwise available. However, it had been carried on cable in Belleville, Ontario and other communities on the north shore of Lake Ontario since the 1980s. It was formerly carried by Eastlink (in SD only) and on Bell Aliant FibreOP TV (in both SD and HD) for viewers in Atlantic Canada until late 2012 (January 30, 2013, in Eastlink&#x27;s case), when it was replaced with WFXT in Boston, a former Fox O&amp;O (now owned by Cox Media Group). The station is also carried in the Thousand Islands region of the North Country in the town of Hammond (via Citizens Cable TV) as well as in the provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador. WUHF has been carried on satellite systems since 1996 and it is currently the only Rochester-based television station seen in Canada on the Shaw Direct satellite provider.

CF Cable in the western suburbs of Montreal used to carry the station in 1995 but replaced it with sister station WUTV from Buffalo the following year. That station was carried on Vidéotron for cable systems outside the West Island. It was also the first Fox station carried on Montreal cable. However, the northern suburbs of that city (particularly Saint-Jérôme) still carry the station, even though in Mont-Tremblant, WFFF-TV along with other Burlington, Vermont–Plattsburgh, New York stations are seen there instead.

<text>Carlo Alberto dalla Chiesa (; 27 September 1920 – 3 September 1982) was an Italian Carabinieri general, notable for campaigning against terrorism during the Years of Lead. He was assassinated in the Via Carini massacre by the Sicilian Mafia in Palermo.

==Biography==
Born in Saluzzo, Cuneo, dalla Chiesa became commandant of the (military) region of Piemonte-Valle d&#x27;Aosta in 1974 and created an anti-terrorism structure in Turin, which succeeded in capturing in September 1974 Red Brigades members Renato Curcio and Alberto Franceschini, with the help of Silvano Girotto, also known as &quot;Frate Mitra&quot; (&quot;Friar Machine Gun&quot;), who infiltrated the organisation.

In the foreword of the Argentine National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons report on the Argentine Dirty War, dalla Chiesa was cited as having rejected the use of torture in Italy in response to the kidnapping of Aldo Moro, the former prime minister killed by the Red Brigades in 1978. In response to a suggestion that torture be used in the investigation, dalla Chiesa stated, &quot;Italy can survive the loss of Aldo Moro. It would not survive the introduction of torture.&quot;

==Death==

On 1 May 1982, dalla Chiesa was appointed as prefect for Palermo to stop the violence of the Second Mafia War. He was murdered in Palermo on the orders of Mafia boss Salvatore Riina. On the evening of 3 September 1982 dalla Chiesa and his second wife Emanuela Setti Carraro were in an Autobianchi A112 driven by her. They were on their way to dinner in a restaurant in Mondello, when at 9:15 pm a BMW 520 driven by Calogero Ganci, sitting next to Antonino Madonia, flanked dalla Chiesa&#x27;s car. Madonia shot 30 rounds with an AK-47 assault rifle, at dalla Chiesa and Carraro. At the same time, from a Honda Cb motorbike driven by Giuseppe Lucchese, Giuseppe Greco used an AK-47 to mortally wound dalla Chiesa&#x27;s escort, police officer Domenico Russo, who was driving a blue Alfa Romeo Alfetta (he would die in coma from his injuries on the 15 September 1982).

Pino Greco was later sentenced for the crime to life imprisonment &quot;in absentia&quot; at the Maxi Trial in December 1987 (even though they didn&#x27;t know at the time he was killed two years before). Antonino Madonia, who shot dalla Chiesa and his wife, was sentenced for the murder after his arrest in 1989. Giuseppe Lucchese was also sentenced for the crime after his arrest in 1990. Calogero Ganci became a government informant in 1996, three years after his arrest. Bernardo Provenzano, Salvatore Riina, Giuseppe Calò, Bernardo Brusca, Francesco Madonia, Nenè Geraci and Francesco Spadaro were later also sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia.

Dalla Chiesa was also investigating the death of Mauro De Mauro, a journalist who had himself been investigating the murder of Enrico Mattei, head of Agip, the Italian oil company.

==Personal life==

His son Nando, who is a sociology professor at the University of Milan and former member of Parliament, is the president honoris causa of the anti-Mafia organisation Libera founded by Luigi Ciotti. His daughters Rita and Simona are respectively a TV presenter and a journalist.

<doc id="628376" wikidata="Q7956033" url="?curid=628376" title="WSYT">
<text>WSYT (channels 43 and 68) is a television station in Syracuse, New York, United States, affiliated with the Fox network and owned by Imagicomm Communications. The station&#x27;s studios are located on James Street/NY 290 in Syracuse&#x27;s Near Northeast section, and its transmitter is located near Maple Grove, a hamlet of Otisco.

WSYT operates a third digital subchannel affiliated with MyNetworkTV which brands as &quot;My 43&quot;. It uses virtual channel 43.1, formerly utilized by separately-licensed WNYS-TV until January 2020, when then-owner Cox Media Group turned in WNYS-TV&#x27;s license and merged its subchannels onto WSYT&#x27;s spectrum as a condition of the 2019 acquisition of Northwest Broadcasting by Apollo Global Management.

==History==
The station was originally assigned the call letters WKAF and was on UHF channel 62 rather than 68. After being reassigned to channel 68, the owners of WKAF (Channel 62 Inc.) got the station on-the-air February 15, 1986, and the outlet aired religious programming for three hours a day. The station was sold to The Flatley Company in late-1986 at which point construction of its facility on James Street in Syracuse began. WSYT began full-time operation on April 5, 1987, with a general entertainment format of cartoons, classic sitcoms, recent sitcoms, movies, drama shows, and sports. The launch of WSYT coincided with the prime time launch of the Fox network of which the station has been an affiliate ever since. For the first six months of the network&#x27;s operations, the network&#x27;s programming (which only consisted of a late-night program at the time) was not available over-the-air in the Syracuse market.

Flatley owned WSYT until 1992 when the station was sold to Encore Communications, later known as Max Media Properties. In 1998, the Sinclair Broadcast Group bought the station. That company entered into a local marketing agreement with UPN affiliate WNYS-TV in 1995 and began operating that station out of WSYT&#x27;s studios. It was carried on cable in the Kingston, Ontario, area until 2009. That market is currently served by WNYF-CD in Watertown (for over-the-air ATSC viewers) and on cable by WUTV in Buffalo and WUHF in Rochester.

Like other Sinclair-owned stations in the region, WSYT and WNYS-TV have been transmitting digital-only signals since February 17, 2009. Until August 2008, WSYT had the highest analog channel allocation of any Fox affiliate before being eclipsed by KSWB-TV in San Diego when that station swapped its CW affiliation with XETV. WSYT&#x27;s analog power was limited to 1,000,000 watts due to its proximity to Canada. Until June 12, 2009 (the official day of the digital television transition in the United States), UHF analog stations in the country were licensed to transmit up to 5,000,000 watts. All of this changed back on February 17, 2009, when WSYT went digital-only and moved to a less power-hungry transmitter on UHF channel 19.

From 1987 through 2003, WSYT owned the local broadcast rights to Syracuse University men&#x27;s basketball games when rights were acquired by Time Warner Cable (now Charter Spectrum) and began airing on their local sports channel. During the majority of those years, WSYT produced a live post-game show as well as a weekly basketball coach&#x27;s show with Jim Boeheim. They also acquired the rights to Big East football in the 1990s and would air a post-game show after a Syracuse Orangemen game was shown. The coverage was expanded to include a football coach&#x27;s show with Paul Pasqualoni and a football preview show hosted by Steve Hyder and Joe Zone. In the late-1980s, WSYT aired New York Yankees games that were produced and broadcast by WPIX in New York City.

On May 15, 2012, Sinclair and Fox agreed to a five-year extension to the network&#x27;s affiliation agreement with Sinclair&#x27;s nineteen Fox stations (including WSYT) allowing them to continue carrying the network&#x27;s programming through 2017. In a YouTube video posted by WBFF in Baltimore in July 2012, it was revealed that WSYT would air &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; and &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; beginning September 17, 2012. WSYT is one of a handful of Fox affiliates to air the game shows along with WBFF, WXIX-TV in Cincinnati, WVUE-DT in New Orleans, WLUK-TV in Green Bay, KDVR in Denver, KVHP in Lake Charles, Louisiana, WALA-TV in Mobile, WLUC-DT2 in Marquette, Michigan, and WDAF-TV in Kansas City.

Sinclair announced the sale of WSYT, the LMA for WNYS-TV, and WYZZ-TV in Peoria–Bloomington, Illinois, to Cunningham Broadcasting on February 28, 2013, following its acquisition of Barrington Broadcasting. The sale was necessary due to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s ownership rules as Sinclair chose to keep Barrington&#x27;s WSTM-TV in Syracuse. However, in an updated filing with the FCC, it was revealed that WSYT would instead be sold to Bristlecone Broadcasting, a company owned by Brian Brady, owner of Northwest Broadcasting. Those transactions were completed on November 25. Following the consummation of the sale, Sinclair continued to operate WSYT and WNYS-TV through a transitional service agreement for six months until May 2014. Sinclair would continue to own the station&#x27;s studios on James Street and its transmitter site in Otisco for at least ten years. Bristlecone Broadcasting was incorporated into the Northwest Broadcasting corporate structure in a May 2015 restructuring of Brady&#x27;s broadcast holdings, making WSYT and WNYS sister stations to WICZ-TV and WBPN-LP in Binghamton.

In 2019, Northwest Broadcasting was in turn acquired by Apollo Global Management, and was to be merged into a new group known as Terrier Media with another AGM acquisition, Cox Media Group. After expanding its purchase to include CMG&#x27;s radio and advertising units, it was announced that the combined group would retain the Cox Media Group name.

On March 29, 2022, Cox Media Group announced it would sell WSYT and 17 other stations to Imagicomm Communications, an affiliate of the parent company of the INSP cable channel, for $488 million; the sale was completed on August 1.

==Newscasts==
From 1996 until 2000 through a news share agreement, NBC affiliate WSTM-TV produced a 30-minute prime time newscast on WSYT called &quot;Fox 68 News at 10&quot;. After WSTM-TV declined to renew the arrangement, WSYT then established a new outsourcing agreement with CBS outlet WTVH. As a result, a new nightly news program began airing on the station with the name &quot;Fox 68 Eyewitness News at 10&quot;. Eventually, an hour-long weekday morning show (also produced by WTVH) debuted and was called &quot;Fox 68 Eyewitness News at 7&quot;. Both of the programs featured the same branding as WTVH&#x27;s newscasts did at the time.

Meanwhile, in 2003, in order to offer competition in the 10 o&#x27;clock slot, WSTM-TV brought back its own half-hour newscast for newly acquired sister station WSTQ-LP that was seen only on weeknights. In April 2006, WTVH ceased producing all local news programming for WSYT in order to focus on its own newscasts that were cemented in third place by this point. Ironically, the nightly 10 o&#x27;clock broadcasts were WTVH&#x27;s most successful having soundly beat WSTM-TV&#x27;s effort on WSTQ-LP in the ratings. Since dropping news programming from the CBS outlet, WSYT remains one of a handful of big four network-affiliated stations throughout the United States (and the largest Fox station in terms of market size, since former sister station WUTV in Buffalo, the previous largest market with a non-news Fox affiliate, added newscasts in 2013) that does not operate its own news department or air local newscasts through a partnership with a big three station.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

On November 1, 2010, WSYT launched The Country Network on its second digital subchannel replacing a standard definition simulcast of its primary channel.

===Translator===
* 16 Ithaca

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WSYT shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 68, on February 17, 2009, the original date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 19, using virtual channel 68.

<text>Lorna Gladys Wing (; 7 October 19286 June 2014) was a British psychiatrist notable for her research into autism. She coined the term &quot;Asperger&#x27;s syndrome&quot; and helped found the National Autistic Society.

==Early life==
Lorna Gladys Tolchard was born at Gillingham, Kent, to Royal Navy engineer Bernard Newberry Tolchard (1898–1968) and Gladys Ethel (died 1962), née Whittell. Following education at Chatham Grammar School for Girls, she commenced medical training at University College Hospital in 1949. After qualifying as a psychiatrist, her first post was at the Institute of Psychiatry, Maudsley Hospital, London (now part of King&#x27;s College London).

==Career==
Although Wing trained as a medical doctor, specialising in psychiatry, her focus narrowed to childhood developmental disorders in 1959. At that time, autism was thought to affect between 1 in 2,000–2,500 children. Its prevalence in the 2010s was considered to be around 1 in 100 following the awareness raised by Wing and her followers. Her research, particularly with her collaborator Judith Gould, now underpins thinking in the field of autism. They initiated the Camberwell Case Register to record all patients using psychiatric services in this area of London. The data accumulated by this innovative approach gave Wing the basis for her influential insight that autism formed a spectrum, rather than clearly differentiated disorders. They also set up the Centre for Social and Communication Disorders, the first integrated diagnostic and advice service for these conditions in the UK.

Wing was the author of many books and academic papers, including &quot;Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome: A Clinical Account&quot;, a February 1981 academic paper that popularised the research of Hans Asperger.

Along with some parents of autistic children, she founded the organisation now known as the National Autistic Society in the UK in 1962. She was a consultant to NAS Lorna Wing Centre for Autism until she died. She was also President of Autism Sussex.

In the 1995 New Year Honours list Wing was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire for &#x27;services to the National Autistic Society&#x27;.

==Personal life==
Wing met her future husband John Wing (22 October 1923 – 18 April 2010) while they were dissecting the same body as medical students. Marrying on 15 May 1950, both specialised as psychiatrists, with John becoming a professor of psychiatry. It was following their realisation that their daughter Susie (1956–2005) was autistic that Lorna Wing became involved in researching developmental disorders, particularly autistic spectrum disorders.

Wing died of bronchopneumonia in Bessels Green, Kent, on 6 June 2014, at the age of 85.

==Hans Asperger controversy==
Wing has faced controversy since the publication of Edith Sheffer&#x27;s 2018 book, &quot;Asperger&#x27;s Children&quot;, due to Wing&#x27;s previous defence of using Hans Asperger&#x27;s name for the &quot;Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome&quot; diagnosis. According to a 2018 article by John Donvan for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Yale psychologist Fred Volkmar, another major figure in the autism field, was on the committee appointed to investigate whether &quot;Asperger&#x27;s syndrome&quot; merited inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) in 1993. Volkmar made a phone call to the only person he knew who had ever met Asperger — Lorna Wing — and asked her whether she knew anything of Hans Asperger&#x27;s rumored ties to the Nazis. Wing, &quot;shocked&quot; at Volkmar&#x27;s inquiry, had defended Asperger as a &quot;religious man&quot;. According to researcher Herwig Czech, Asperger &quot;hailed from Roman Catholic circles, and his orientation during the period of the [previous Austrian] system was strictly Catholic&quot;.

Donvan, the author of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; article, also included this information in his 2016 book, &quot;In a Different Key: The Story of Autism&quot;, in which he described Wing as &quot;speaking of [Hans Asperger]&#x27;s deep Catholic faith and lifelong devotion to young people&quot;, and claimed that Wing had dismissed Asperger&#x27;s Nazi ties on account that &quot;he [Asperger] was a very religious man&quot;. Prior to Wing&#x27;s popularization of &quot;Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome&quot; in the 1980s and early 1990s, Donvan writes, &quot;Asperger, dead for thirteen years [by 1993], [had] never [been] a great presence on the world stage, [and] remained a little-known figure&quot;.

<text>WNYS-TV (channel 43) was a television station in Syracuse, New York, United States, which operated from 1989 to 2020. In its latter years, it was owned by Northwest Broadcasting as an affiliate of MyNetworkTV; it had common ownership with Fox affiliate WSYT (channel 68). WNYS-TV&#x27;s operations were housed at WSYT&#x27;s studio facilities on James Street/NY 290 in Syracuse&#x27;s Near Northeast section; the station&#x27;s transmitter was located near Maple Grove, a hamlet of Otisco, New York.

WNYS-TV went off the air on January 14, 2020, ahead of the surrender of its license as a condition of Apollo Global Management&#x27;s 2019 acquisition of Northwest Broadcasting. At that time, the station&#x27;s programming continued as subchannels of WSYT, continuing to use virtual channel 43. What was WNYS-TV&#x27;s primary subchannel continues under the WSYT license as &quot;My 43&quot;.

==History==
===As WNYS-TV===
====As an independent station====
The station began broadcasting in October 1989 as an independent with the call sign WSNR-TV. Its call letters were changed in 1994 to WNYS-TV. This had been previously used on what is now ABC affiliate WSYR-TV (channel 9) from 1962 until 1978.

====UPN affiliation; transition to The WB====
On January 16, 1995, WNYS-TV became a charter affiliate of UPN. In that same year, Max Media Properties (then owner of WSYT) entered into an LMA with WNYS-TV and began operating the station out of that outlet&#x27;s facility. It switched to The WB in January 2001 after which UPN was picked up ten months later on October 20 by low-power WAWA-LP (later WSTQ-LP). That station, however, would not be available on Time Warner Cable in Syracuse until July 2003, as cable companies are not obligated to carry low-power stations under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations. As a result, between June 2001 and July 2003, Boston superstation WSBK-TV served as the UPN affiliate for Syracuse Time Warner Cable subscribers.

====MyNetworkTV affiliation====
On September 5, 2006, WNYS-TV affiliated with its third network in the last twelve years becoming a MyNetworkTV affiliate. Along with other Sinclair stations in New York State, WNYS-TV and WSYT have been transmitting digital-only signals since February 17, 2009. Sinclair announced the sale of WSYT, the LMA for WNYS-TV, and WYZZ-TV in Peoria–Bloomington, Illinois, to Cunningham Broadcasting on February 28, 2013, following its acquisition of Barrington Broadcasting. The sale was necessary due to the FCC&#x27;s ownership rules as Sinclair chose to keep Barrington&#x27;s WSTM-TV (channel 3) in Syracuse.

However, in an updated filing with the FCC, it was revealed that WSYT would instead be sold to Bristlecone Broadcasting, a company owned by Brian Brady (owner of Northwest Broadcasting) whose only other assets in New York State were WICZ-TV and WBPN-LP in Binghamton. Those transactions were completed on November 25.

Following the consummation of the sale, Sinclair continued to operate WSYT and WNYS-TV through a transitional service agreement for six months until May 2014. Sinclair will continue to own the station&#x27;s studios on James Street and its transmitter site in Otisco for at least ten years. WNYS-TV previously maintained its own website but as a result of the sale to Bristlecone, this was abandoned in favor of a shared website with WSYT. In late-January 2015, its second digital subchannel began carrying GetTV, a Sony Pictures Entertainment-owned digital off-air broadcast channel providing mostly classic films from the Sony library.

Bristlecone Broadcasting was incorporated into the Northwest Broadcasting corporate structure in a May 2015 restructuring of Brian Brady&#x27;s broadcast holdings. On November 20, 2015, the WNYS-TV license was sold by RKM Media to Syracuse Broadcasting. The sale originated in 2005 as an attempt by Sinclair to buy WNYS outright for $3.1 million; the rights to acquire the station were transferred to Bristlecone as part of its purchase of WSYT, and were in turn sold to Syracuse Broadcasting for $250,000 on August 10, 2015. On October 1, 2018, Northwest acquired WNYS outright for $100,000. The sale was completed on December 6.

===Surrender of license; move to WSYT&#x27;s spectrum===
As part of Apollo Global Management&#x27;s purchase of Northwest, the company would have had to sell one of their two television stations in the market or shut one of them down, as a federal appeals court ruled that Apollo could not own both stations. After the sale was completed, it was decided to migrate the intellectual unit and programming of WNYS-TV to a digital subchannel of WSYT. WNYS-TV&#x27;s license was then surrendered on January 21, 2020.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
As mentioned above, the station shares WSYT&#x27;s bandwidth and is officially recognized as a WSYT subchannel (if going by actual physical channel without PSIP intervention, channel 43&#x27;s two channels are 14.5 and 14.6), but retains its own multiplexed channel map as channel 43:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WNYS-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 43, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44, using virtual channel 43.

<text>KHSV (channel 21) is a television station in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, affiliated with the digital multicast network MeTV. KHSV is owned by Howard Stirk Holdings and broadcasts from Black Mountain, near Henderson (southwest of I-11/US 93/US 95).

Channel 21 went on the air as KRLR, the second independent station for Las Vegas, on July 31, 1984. Initially reliant on music videos, it broadened its mix of programming and sports soon after launch. KRLR became an affiliate of UPN at its launch in January 1995 and changed its call sign to KUPN. However, after Sinclair Broadcast Group acquired the station in 1997, poor relations between Sinclair and UPN led the company to change affiliations to The WB in 1998, with the station switching its call sign to KVWB shortly thereafter. Sinclair then began managing and later owning the former WB affiliate, KFBT (channel 33). Between 2003 and 2006, both stations aired local newscasts powered by the company&#x27;s News Central.

In 2006, when The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, Sinclair first signed a group deal for the rival MyNetworkTV service for KVWB before acquiring the rights to The CW for KFBT. To reinforce its new network identity, KVWB again changed its call sign to KVMY.

Sinclair agreed in 2014 to acquire KSNV, the NBC affiliate, from the Intermountain West Communications Company. However, since Sinclair already owned two Las Vegas stations, it opted to merge the three stations onto the two licenses it already owned. In late 2014, Sinclair switched the technical facilities and licenses of KSNV and KVMY while absorbing the MyNetworkTV programming onto a subchannel of KVCW. The former KSNV license and facility, now under the KVMY call letters, was then sold to Howard Stirk Holdings and renamed KHSV.

==History==
===KRLR and KUPN===
In 1980, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated four applications for comparative hearing to determine who would be the first to build and operate a television station on the ultra high frequency (UHF) band in Las Vegas. The applications came from DRES Media of Las Vegas, led by the Scott and Foremaster families; Alden Communications, a California firm which also filed for channels in Seattle and Portland, Oregon; Broadcast West Inc., based in North Las Vegas; and Channel 21 Corporation, whose principals were two New Jersey businessmen. Three of the applications had been filed in 1978, anticipating a possible boom in subscription television broadcasting.

The station began broadcasting on July 31, 1984. It originally broadcast as &quot;Vusic 21&quot;, devoting most of its time to music videos; KRLR management boasted that theirs was the first 24-hour music video station in the country, though the format was also an aid to getting the station on the air in short order. Over the course of the next year, the independent station transformed its schedule into a broader mix of entertainment programming by acquiring movies and syndicated programs. The first notable exception to the music video format came months after signing on, when the station signed for rights to air telecasts of Las Vegas Americans indoor soccer. Sports played a key role in the station&#x27;s schedule in the late 1980s; channel 21 broadcast a partial-season package of UNLV Runnin&#x27; Rebels basketball and selected UNLV football games, and it was also a heavy baseball broadcaster, featuring the San Diego Padres and Oakland Athletics on its schedule.

Dennis Todd, a subcontractor for KRLR, was working on the station&#x27;s Black Mountain tower on May 4, 1988, when the nearby Pacific Engineering and Production Company facility exploded. Todd was known to tape some of his work and had a video camera with him while on the tower. After the first blast, he began recording the unfolding disaster; he was flown with his camera to NBC in Burbank, California, from which his footage was fed to NBC affiliates nationwide.

As the first Las Vegas station on the UHF band, KRLR&#x27;s promotion in tuning and antennas forged a path for two stations that followed it in the decade: KBLR-TV (channel 39) and KFBT (channel 33). However, in the ratings, it was a distant second to KVVU, one of the nation&#x27;s strongest independent outlets.

In 1993, DRES Media filed to sell KRLR to Las Vegas Channel 21 Inc., a company owned by Michael J. Lambert, for $4.875 million. The new ownership affiliated channel 21 with the new United Paramount Network (UPN) at its launch on January 16, 1995, and changed its call letters to KUPN on March 6 of that year. Lambert more than recouped his investment by selling KUPN to Sinclair Broadcast Group for $87 million in 1997; the transaction represented the company&#x27;s entry to a market where TV revenues had doubled in just four years.

===KVWB and KVMY===
The purchase of KUPN came months before Sinclair&#x27;s relationship with UPN frosted over. On July 21, 1997, Sinclair signed a long-term affiliation agreement with Time Warner, under which the group committed five of its UPN-affiliated stations to that network in 1998, with a sixth independent station to join in 1999. The high-profile move by Sinclair to move five stations from UPN to The WB, its direct competitor, led to a legal dispute between the companies. UPN sued Sinclair, alleging it had breached its affiliation contract by exiting it early. On January 14, 1998, Sinclair announced that KUPN would join The WB, taking the affiliation from KFBT, in a switch later postponed to March 1; KFBT did not pick up UPN, and a month later, Sinclair struck a deal to operate KFBT under a local marketing agreement. Channel 21&#x27;s call letters remained KUPN until changing to KVWB on May 27, 1998.

The affiliation switch was beneficial for the station&#x27;s ratings; in prime time, it saw a 150-percent increase between November 1997 and November 1998. In January 1999, Sinclair hired a news director with plans to debut an hour-long 10 p.m. newscast, the second in the market, for the fall television season; its launch was to be contingent on the station moving into new, studios to be built in Summerlin. The station instead programmed reruns of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in the hour. In November 1999, KVWB tied KVVU in sign-on to sign-off ratings for the first time in history.

On October 13, 2003, Sinclair debuted local News Central hybrid newscasts for KVWB (at 10 p.m.) and KFBT (at 7 p.m.). As with others of its type, the newscasts combined local news coverage read by anchors in Las Vegas with national news and weather from Sinclair&#x27;s corporate headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland. News Central wound down in March 2006; the KVWB newscast ceased on March 3 and was soon after replaced with one produced by NBC affiliate KVBC.

In 2006, The WB and UPN were shut down and replaced with The CW, which offered programming from both predecessor networks. However, Sinclair was late to sign an agreement with The CW. The news of the merger resulted in Sinclair announcing, two months later, that most of its UPN and WB affiliates, including KVWB, would join MyNetworkTV, a new service formed by the News Corporation, which was also owner of the Fox network. It was not until May 2 that an agreement was signed for KFBT and several other Sinclair-owned stations to join The CW. To reinforce their new affiliations, KVWB and KFBT became KVMY and KVCW in June 2006, relaunching as &quot;My LV TV&quot; and &quot;The CW Las Vegas&quot; when the new networks debuted in September.

On May 15, 2012, Sinclair and Fox agreed to a five-year affiliation agreement extension for the station group&#x27;s 19 Fox-affiliated stations until 2017. This included an option, that was exercisable between July 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013, for Fox parent News Corporation to buy a combination of six Sinclair-owned stations (two CW/MyNetworkTV duopolies and two standalone MyNetworkTV affiliates) in three out of four markets; KVMY and KVCW were included in the Fox purchase option, along with stations in Cincinnati (WSTR-TV); Raleigh, North Carolina (WLFL/WRDC); and Norfolk, Virginia (WTVZ). In January 2013, Fox announced that it would not exercise its option to buy any of the Sinclair stations.

===2014 license swap and sale to Howard Stirk Holdings===
On September 3, 2014, Intermountain West Communications Company announced that it would sell KSNV-DT to Sinclair for $120 million. As Sinclair already owned a duopoly in Las Vegas, it could not add a third license, the company planned to sell the license assets (though not the programming) of one of the three stations to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, with the divested station&#x27;s programming being moved to the other stations. On November 1, 2014, Sinclair began the process of realigning KSNV, KVCW, and KVMY. It moved the MyNetworkTV programming to a subchannel of KVCW and relocate KSNV&#x27;s call letters, programming, and channel number to what had been KVMY. The KSNV technical facility then became KVMY, retaining virtual channel 21 but not the MyNetworkTV programming, and was sold to Howard Stirk Holdings, a company owned by conservative commentator Armstrong Williams. The $150,000 purchase price primarily consisted of the transmission facility. The call sign on channel 21 changed to KHSV on March 7, 2016.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
The present channel 2 digital technical facility was built by KSNV, then KVBC, and activated on October 22, 2002.

Pre-swap KVMY shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 21, on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate; pre-swap KVBC did not follow suit on that date. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 22; similarly, when KVBC shut down, its signal continued on channel 2 prior to the 2014 swap.

<text>KVCW (channel 33) is a television station in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, affiliated with The CW and MyNetworkTV. It is owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group alongside NBC affiliate KSNV (channel 3). The two stations share studios on Foremaster Lane in Las Vegas; KVCW&#x27;s transmitter is located on Black Mountain, near Henderson (southwest of I-11/US 93/US 95).

==History==
===Early years===
On April 22, 1987, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued an original construction permit to 4-A Communications to build a new full-power television station, on UHF channel 33, to serve the Las Vegas market. 4-A Communications, owned by Lawrence and Teri DePaulis, became Channel 33, Inc. (which remained the station&#x27;s licensee until 2015) in August 1987. The station, known as KFBT, went on the air on July 30, 1989, under a program test authority and was given a license one month later. The station&#x27;s original transmitter was located in the McCullough Range southwest of Henderson. On July 20, 1990, a family ownership group headed by Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Koker purchased Channel 33, Inc. Under the Kokers, KFBT was an independent station with a firmly local flavor and soon garnered much acclaim with features such as the scary B-movie showcase &quot;Saturday Fright at the Movies&quot;, hosted by Count Cool Rider, which aired at 10 p.m. Count Cool Rider was actually Danny Koker II, son of the station president and also one of the station&#x27;s owners, who has since gone on to become a respected builder of custom motorcycles, as well as a regular expert on the History Channel series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot; and host of its spinoff, &quot;Counting Cars&quot;.

===As a WB affiliate and return to independence===
The station primarily broadcast older movies, sitcoms, and dramas during this era, as well as some Christian religious programs (as the senior Koker was a gospel musician) and professional wrestling (most notably World Class Championship Wrestling and the National Wrestling Alliance). KFBT became a charter affiliate of The WB at the network&#x27;s launch on January 11, 1995, and remained an affiliate while owned by the Koker family. On December 18, 1997, the Koker family sold Channel 33, Inc. to Montecito Broadcasting Corporation with the sale being finalized on February 3, 1998. The same day that Montecito closed on its purchase of KFBT, it immediately entered into an agreement to be acquired by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, which Montecito entered into a local marketing agreement (LMA) to operate KFBT, until the transaction was completed. On March 1, 1998, Sinclair moved the WB affiliation to KUPN (channel 21, which later changed calls to KVWB, now KSNV) and KFBT was to affiliate with UPN, but Sinclair did not sign an affiliation contract and KFBT became an independent station instead leaving no local provider of the network over the air, which caused public outcry for Las Vegas viewers. Eventually the next year, KCNG-LP signed on and picked up the UPN affiliation, immediately asserting network exclusivity in the market and causing providers to drop KCOP and WWOR on their request. The station was rebranded as &quot;Gold 33&quot; and began showing mainly newer syndicated programming. Sinclair completed its purchase of Montecito and Channel 33, Inc. in February 2000, resulting in the creation of the market&#x27;s first duopoly between KFBT and KVWB.

===As a CW affiliate===
On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation (the parent company of UPN) and the Warner Bros. unit of Time Warner announced that The WB and UPN would be shut down that September and have some of their higher-rated programs migrated onto a new jointly owned network called The CW. On February 22, News Corporation announced that it would start up another new network called MyNetworkTV. This new service, which would be a sister network to Fox, would be operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division, Twentieth Television. MyNetworkTV was created in order to give stations affiliated with UPN and The WB that were not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates another option besides becoming independent stations, as well as to compete against The CW.

Sinclair chose to affiliate KVWB with MyNetworkTV leaving The CW to join with either low-power UPN affiliate KTUD-CA (channel 25) or KFBT. Sinclair began negotiations with The CW to affiliate KFBT, and in April, when KTUD decided to go independent instead of pursuing a CW affiliation, KFBT was virtually assured The CW affiliation. An affiliation agreement was announced on May 2 and KFBT changed its call letters to the current KVCW on June 19, reflecting its pending affiliation with the new network. KVMY (now KHSV) affiliated with MyNetworkTV, when the network launched on September 5, two weeks before The WB was scheduled to shut down and The CW made its debut; as a result, KVCW rejoined The WB for the network&#x27;s last two weeks of programming before switching its affiliation to The CW on September 18.

On May 15, 2012, Sinclair and Fox agreed to a five-year affiliation agreement extension for the station group&#x27;s 19 Fox-affiliated stations until 2017. This included an option, that was exercisable between July 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013, for Fox parent News Corporation to buy a combination of six Sinclair-owned stations (two CW/MyNetworkTV duopolies and two standalone MyNetworkTV affiliates) in three out of four markets; KVCW and KVMY were included in the Fox purchase option, along with stations in Cincinnati (WSTR-TV), Raleigh (WLFL/WRDC) and Norfolk (WTVZ-TV). In January 2013, Fox announced that it would not exercise its option to buy any of the Sinclair stations in the four markets included in the option.

On August 13, 2013, KSNV-DT announced that the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; would move to KVCW as of August 19. The move of the program was necessitated after KSNV changed its schedule to accommodate a 3 p.m. newscast. On September 3, 2014, Sinclair announced the purchase of KSNV from Intermountain West Communications Company for $120 million. As Sinclair already owns KVCW and KVMY, the company will sell the license assets (though not the programming) of one of the three stations to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, with the divested station&#x27;s programming being relocated to the other stations. On November 1, 2014, KVMY&#x27;s programming was moved to KVCW&#x27;s second digital subchannel, while KSNV&#x27;s programming began to simulcast on KVMY&#x27;s license. With the sale&#x27;s completion, Sinclair now controls half of those stations. It also created a situation in which a CW affiliate is the nominal senior partner in a duopoly involving an NBC affiliate and a &quot;Big Four&quot; station.

==Programming==
===Sports programming===
On February 3, 2021, the Henderson Silver Knights announced a partnership with KVCW to broadcast 10 home games during the team&#x27;s inaugural season. This partnership would continue in the 2021–22 season.

On May 21, 2021, the WNBA&#x27;s Las Vegas Aces announced a partnership with MyLVTV to televise 25 games during the 2021 WNBA season. The Aces later moved to KVVU-TV.

===Newscasts===

In 2003, former sister station KVWB established a news department and began airing an hour-long primetime newscast at 10 p.m. It was part of Sinclair&#x27;s centralized &quot;News Central&quot; operation that was based at the company&#x27;s headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland. National and international news segments, weather forecasts and some sports segments originated from the company&#x27;s Hunt Valley facility, while local news and sports segments were based at KFBT/KVWB&#x27;s Las Vegas studios. The news department was shared with KFBT, which aired its own local newscast at 7 p.m. It also aired &quot;The Point&quot;, a one-minute conservative political commentary, that was required to be broadcast on all Sinclair-owned stations with newscasts. The news department was shut down at the beginning of March 2006, as were the majority of Sinclair&#x27;s news operations under the News Central format.

KVWB later entered into a news share agreement with NBC affiliate KVBC (channel 3, now KSNV) to produce a nightly 10 p.m. newscast for channel 21. The newscast, originally titled &quot;News 3 at 10 on The WB Las Vegas&quot;, debuted on April 4, 2006, and was later renamed to &quot;News 3 at 10 on MyLVTV&quot; to correspond with KVMY&#x27;s affiliation switch to MyNetworkTV. The program was discontinued on December 15, 2006, and moved to KVCW the following Monday under the title &quot;News 3 at 10 on The CW Las Vegas&quot;. On August 11, 2007, KVBC became the second station in the Las Vegas market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition and the KVCW broadcast was included in the upgrade. The 10 p.m. newscast originated from KVBC&#x27;s studios on Foremaster Lane in Las Vegas near the border with North Las Vegas. KVBC also produced a 15-minute sports highlight program called &quot;Sports Zone&quot;, that aired weeknights at 10:45. Both programs were discontinued on September 28, 2009, and replaced with syndicated programming.

As of August 17, 2015, current sister station KSNV relaunched newscasts on KVCW. &quot;Wake Up with The CW Las Vegas&quot; airs from 7 to 9 a.m. and the half-hour broadcast of &quot;The CW Las Vegas News at Ten&quot;, airs at 10 p.m. Both newscasts compete with KVVU&#x27;s 7 a.m. segment of &quot;Fox 5 News This Morning&quot; and the 10 p.m. airing of &quot;Fox 5 News at Ten&quot;.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
=== Analog-to-digital conversion ===
When the FCC released its initial digital channel allocations on April 21, 1997, it had assigned KFBT&#x27;s digital companion channel to UHF channel 32. The allocations met with considerable resistance from low-power broadcasters who would be displaced by the digital channel allocations, and on February 17, 1998, the FCC issued a revised final DTV allocation table. KFBT&#x27;s original allocation would have displaced low-powered K31DO (now KNBX-CD), so the FCC substituted UHF channel 29 allowing channel 32 to be assigned to KMCC-DT in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, and eliminating a displacement there. KFBT was granted a permit to construct its digital facilities on January 26, 2001. Technical difficulties delayed construction of the full-power facilities requiring extensions of the construction permit.

On November 8, 2002, KFBT was granted special temporary authority (STA) to construct a low-power facility in order to comply with the FCC deadline for commencing digital broadcasting while the full-power facilities were still being built. The station, now known as KVCW-DT, completed construction of its full-power digital facilities in January 2007 and was granted a license on March 8. Back in 2006, the FCC required each station with a digital companion channel to select which one it would continue to use after the end of the transition period (at that time scheduled for February 17, 2009). KVCW-DT selected channel 29 as its final digital channel and returned the channel 33 license to the FCC. Digital television receivers display the station&#x27;s virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 33. Regular analog programming was dropped on February 18, 2009, with the station participating in the &quot;Analog Nightlight&quot; program for two weeks, with a broadcast explaining how to switch to digital reception.

===ATSC 3.0 lighthouse===


On May 26, 2020, KVCW discontinued ATSC 1.0 broadcasts and became one of the first stations in the country (and the first in the Western United States) to begin broadcasting in ATSC 3.0.

<text>WMYA-TV (channel 40) is a television station licensed to Anderson, South Carolina, United States, broadcasting the digital multicast network Dabl to Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina. It is owned by Cunningham Broadcasting and operated under a local marketing agreement (LMA) by Sinclair Broadcast Group, owner of Asheville, North Carolina–based ABC/MyNetworkTV affiliate WLOS (channel 13). However, Sinclair effectively owns WMYA-TV, as the majority of Cunningham&#x27;s stock is owned by the family of deceased group founder Julian Smith. The nominal main studio for WMYA-TV is the WLOS news bureau on Villa Road in Greenville, South Carolina; WMYA-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in Fountain Inn, South Carolina.

Founded as WAIM-TV in 1953, the station primarily broadcast local network programming to the Anderson area, serving as an affiliate of ABC and CBS after 1956. However, it lost ABC affiliation at the start of 1979 and failed as an independent station after six months, leading to more than five years of silence. It reemerged as WAXA and had more success serving the market, including two years as the region&#x27;s first Fox affiliate. However, after the death of its owner in 1987 and more than a year off the air, the station was sold to WLOS for use as a rebroadcaster to reach areas of the Upstate that its Asheville-centric signal could not. In 1995, WLOS converted WAXA to separate programming as independent WFBC-TV. It then became an affiliate of The WB and later MyNetworkTV. Its programming was moved to a subchannel of WLOS in 2021, leaving WMYA to rebroadcast national digital subchannels. In 2022, the station became the ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV) transmitter for upstate South Carolina; its subchannels are now transmitted by other local stations on its behalf.

==History==
===WAIM-TV===
On February 29, 1952, Wilton E. Hall, publisher of the &quot;Anderson Independent&quot; and &quot;Daily Mail&quot; (since merged as the &quot;Anderson Independent-Mail&quot;) and owner of radio stations WAIM (1230 AM) and WCAC-FM (101.1 FM, now WROQ), applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval to build a new television station in Anderson on channel 58. Another application was filed for channel 58 by the Anderson Television Company, and in August 1953, at Hall&#x27;s request, the FCC added channel 40 to Anderson. The FCC then granted the construction permit for WAIM-TV on September 30, 1953. The station was quickly built and began broadcasting on December 11, 1953.

Originally an affiliate of CBS, the station&#x27;s financial viability was nearly immediately jeopardized. Spartanburg radio station WORD held a construction permit for very high frequency (VHF) channel 7 and sought to use it on an interim basis from Paris Mountain, west of Spartanburg and closer to Anderson than the originally proposed site of Hogback Mountain. The threat of a new VHF station which, unlike the UHF station Hall operated, could reach all homes without sets having to be converted immediately dimmed WAIM-TV&#x27;s prospects. In February 1954, Hall petitioned the FCC to set aside its earlier grant of temporary authority for WORD-TV, later changed to WSPA-TV, to broadcast from Paris Mountain, having already lost nearly $60,000 in canceled advertising contracts and lost CBS revenue; he feared losing his CBS affiliation altogether. WAIM-TV was one of three stations protesting this relocation of channel 7, along with WGVL (channel 23) in Greenville and the never-built WSCV (channel 17) in Spartanburg; all three protests were denied.

WGVL and WAIM-TV took the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, seeking injunctive relief from the FCC ruling, in the summer of 1954. On January 31, 1955, the appeals court heard arguments by WGVL and WAIM against the WSPA-TV authorization on Paris Mountain, having obtained six months prior a restraining order preventing Spartan from building its transmitter facility until the case was heard (though the studios were near completion and initial preparations had been made on Paris Mountain). While WGVL and WAIM-TV claimed that the FCC should not have granted the application without giving them a hearing, the commission argued that they did not have standing to show injury that would be caused by WSPA-TV going on air and that the procedure the stations sought to use was the improper forum to delay such a grant. Even though the two UHF stations won a hearing at the FCC, the hearing examiner&#x27;s recommendation would not be favorable to them. Examiner James D. Cunningham recommended the FCC approve the WSPA-TV move to Paris Mountain, saying that the UHF stations &quot;failed to make a satisfactory showing&quot; as to the economic damages they would incur and that, because UHF converters were widely distributed in their broadcast areas, they would not be at a disadvantage. WGVL and WAIM-TV counsel asked for oral argument on the decision, warning that it would be &quot;aggravating the forces now making for unequal competition in the television field and hastening the trend towards complete obliteration of UHF&quot;.

The FCC made a final decision in favor of Spartan on March 9, 1956, reaffirming many of the arguments made by the hearing examiner. When the appeals court gave its approval for WSPA-TV, WGVL and WAIM-TV announced their intentions to leave the air. On Sunday, April 29, 1956, WSPA-TV signed on; channel 23 left the air that day, Concurrently, the station also unsuccessfully sought relief in the form of moving channel 7 out of the Upstate and to Knoxville, Tennessee, while Hall engaged with equipment manufacturer Federal Telecommunications Laboratories in a legal dispute; he stopped paying what he owed on a transmitter he claimed was defective, &quot;worthless and useless&quot; because it could not broadcast network color programming in color.

WAIM-TV temporarily suspended operation on May 27, only to return two days later after securing additional programming. In July, it became an affiliate of ABC. In addition to a secondary affiliation with CBS, the station also broadcast South Carolina Educational Television daytime programs for schools for a time in the 1960s. While WAIM-TV&#x27;s ABC affiliation agreement allowed it to carry any network program not aired by WLOS in Asheville, which was not receivable in the Anderson area, WLOS permitted the station to rebroadcast all ABC programs it aired. The station aired a limited schedule and sold very little local advertising.

In 1977, Hall announced the sale of his broadcasting properties to Frank L. Outlaw II of Greenville; the $850,000 transaction marked his retirement. Outlaw promised to begin live TV broadcasts from the Anderson studio. The sale was approved by the FCC the next year—with Outlaw selling a half-stake to Bob Nations and doing business under the name &quot;The ONE Corporation&quot; (Outlaw-Nations Entertainment)—but it also started the clock ticking on the need to reinvent channel 40. The owners had feared that they could have had to shutter the station on July 1, but ABC gave the station an extra six months to continue broadcasting its programming through the end of 1978. In the last two months of the year, the station began to transition its schedule to that of an independent. During this time, it began broadcasting in color. On January 1, 1979, WAIM-TV became a full-time independent station.

Rather quickly, Nations and Outlaw found that Anderson merchants were not ready to do much television advertising. The station needed to get on cable across the Upstate to be viable as an independent. While some systems added WAIM-TV, cable penetration was too low in those days to meaningfully increase the station&#x27;s potential audience. The station had begun airing 18 hours per day after becoming an independent but was forced to cut back to eight hours per day later in January. Nations and Outlaw initially planned to return the dropped programming to the schedule once advertising picked up, but by April, Nations and Outlaw put the station back on the market. In mid-May 1979, the transmitter broke down, plunging channel 40 into a silence that would last five years.

Nations and Outlaw sold a minority stake in the station to Ivey Communications of Orlando, Florida. Plans were formulated to return the station to service by the summer of 1980 with an upgraded physical plant. By December 1980, mid-1981 was cited as a date for the station&#x27;s return.

===WAXA===
New South Television sold WAIM-TV in 1983 to Mark III Broadcasting of South Carolina, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Agronomics, Inc. Agronomics changed the call letters to WAXA, obtained approval for a new tower site for the station, and broke ground in November 1983 on studios on the U.S. 29 bypass. Mark III built a tower in the Fork Shoals section of Fountain Inn, over taller than WAIM-TV&#x27;s old tower near Anderson College. It featured a transmitter capable of 2.5 million watts of power, enough to cover the entire Upstate, though not Asheville; WAXA applied for a translator on channel 46 to cover that area.

After five and a half years, channel 40 returned to South Carolina screens on October 1, 1984, with a lineup mostly consisting of movies and syndicated reruns. Several local programs were added, including three music video shows and public affairs program &quot;Straight Talk&quot;. Stereo sound broadcasting began in March, making WAXA the first station in South Carolina to provide it.

WAXA was the area&#x27;s first Fox affiliate when the network started on October 9, 1986; it also debuted on Asheville cable the next month, a major development for a station that had long struggled to reach viewers in western North Carolina.

However, momentum was halted by the death of Agronomics owner Anthony Kupris in October 1987; his widow Mary was largely an absentee owner who at one point told &quot;The Greenville News&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m not a broadcaster&quot;. In May 1988, Mary reached a deal to sell WAXA to Jones Commercial, Inc., of Chicago. Another major setback occurred while the deal was pending when Pappas Telecasting Companies, owner of competing independent WHNS (channel 21), secured a group affiliation deal with Fox. WAXA was one of several Fox affiliates who were displeased with the poor performance of Fox&#x27;s Saturday night lineup; this was one factor in channel 40 severing ties with Fox. No contract was ever finalized with Jones, and while WAXA claimed that getting out of its Fox affiliation was reducing programming costs, it did lay off some staff in late 1988 for what it termed &quot;budgetary reasons&quot;.

===Simulcast of WLOS===
In March 1989, it was reported that AnchorMedia, the owner of WLOS, was interested in acquiring WAXA. The next month, a sale contract was announced, as were plans for AnchorMedia to run the station as a satellite of WLOS for the benefit of viewers who received a marginal signal from that station.

The AnchorMedia deal required FCC approval, which was its own wrinkle because it would have created overlap with WLOS. At the time, one company could not own two television stations in the same media market. Awaiting this approval, and with many program contracts expiring, WAXA went off the air on September 1, 1989. Six months later, the FCC ruled; it found that the purchase of WAXA was not in the public interest and denied the transaction. However, the two parties continued to negotiate a simulcast agreement by which the station would not be sold outright but still simulcast WLOS.

In January 1991, WAXA returned to the air as a near-total simulcast of WLOS. AnchorMedia and Mary Kupris appealed the FCC&#x27;s denial of the outright sale of the station and won a victory at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which ordered the FCC to reconsider its denial; one concurring statement by Laurence Silberman noted that the court even considered ordering the transfer granted and expressed the opinion that &quot;there is no alternative use for the frequency&quot;. That August, a public affairs program for the Anderson area, &quot;Viewpoint 40&quot;, was introduced as an opt-out for WAXA viewers only. In 1992, WLOS reached a deal with the &quot;Independent-Mail&quot; to share news material and announced it would start producing a South Carolina newscast at 6 p.m. for air on channel 40.

===WB and MyNetworkTV affiliation===
AnchorMedia, under the name Continental Broadcasting, sold its three television stations to River City Broadcasting of St. Louis in 1994. River City embarked on a strategy to operate channel 40 with separate programming from WLOS. On September 2, 1995, the station became independent station WFBC-TV (call letters previously used by WYFF from 1953 to 1983), using a mix of newly acquired programs and shows to which WLOS already held the rights.

River City sold its assets to Sinclair Broadcast Group in 1996. Because River City had split WFBC-TV from WLOS, Sinclair itself could not purchase both stations. The license for WFBC-TV was assigned to Glencairn, Ltd., a new group headed by former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards. The family of Sinclair Broadcast Group founder Julian Sinclair Smith owned 97 percent of Glencairn&#x27;s stock, effectively making WLOS and WFBC-TV a duopoly in violation of FCC rules. Sinclair further circumvented the rules by having WLOS take over WFBC-TV&#x27;s operations as the senior partner in a local marketing agreement. Pulitzer Broadcasting, owner of WYFF, petitioned against the River City sale of WFBC-TV to Glencairn, contending that the combination of the Glencairn sale and LMA with WLOS would give Sinclair an &quot;unfair competitive wedge&quot; in the market.

Rainbow/PUSH, headed by Jesse Jackson, filed challenges against Glencairn&#x27;s planned merger with Sinclair in 1998, citing concerns over a single company holding two broadcast licenses in one market and arguing that Glencairn—headed by former Sinclair executive Edwin Edwards, a Black man—passed itself off as a minority-owned company. The FCC levied a $40,000 fine against Sinclair in 2001 for illegally controlling Glencairn; it also prevented Sinclair from buying WBSC-TV outright because it would have left the Greenville/Spartanburg/Asheville market with only seven unique TV station owners in the market as a result. FCC rules of the time required a market to have at least eight unique owners once a duopoly is formed. Glencairn subsequently changed its name to Cunningham Broadcasting Corporation, but its stock is still almost entirely owned by the Smith family, and the companies continued to be closely related.

As part of a 1997 affiliation agreement between Sinclair and The WB, WFBC-TV became a WB affiliate on September 6, 1999, and changed its call letters to WBSC-TV to reflect its programming and location in South Carolina.

In 2006, when The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, Sinclair first elected to affiliate with MyNetworkTV, a new network started by Fox Television Stations, over The CW. On March 2, ten days after the network&#x27;s existence was announced on February 22, Sinclair affiliated 17 stations it owned or managed, including WBSC-TV, with the network. The call letters were changed to WMYA-TV in recognition of the new network affiliation. Local programming also continued to air. In 2008, the station began airing a fall package of local high school football games—North Carolina games on Thursdays and South Carolina games on Fridays—which by 2015 drew viewership comparable to or greater than MyNetworkTV programming.

On September 20, 2021, &quot;My 40&quot; and the MyNetworkTV programming moved exclusively to the 13.2 subchannel of WLOS. This left the WMYA-TV multiplex airing four diginets, with the main subchannel airing Dabl, in time for ATSC 3.0 conversion in 2022.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s ATSC 1.0 channels are carried on the multiplexed signals of other television stations in the market:
===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WMYA discontinued regular programming on its analog signal, over UHF channel 40, on February 17, 2009, one day after the original date for full-power television stations in the United States to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which Congress had moved the previous week to June 12). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 14, using virtual channel 40. The analog signal remained on for a time after as part of the SAFER Act to provide transition information.

===ATSC 3.0 lighthouse===

On June 2, 2022, WMYA-TV was converted to ATSC 3.0 (NextGen TV), with simulcasts from WYFF, WSPA-TV, WLOS and WHNS.

<doc id="628390" wikidata="Q434786" url="?curid=628390" title="Arnaldo Forlani">
<text>Arnaldo Forlani (; 8 December 1925 – 6 July 2023) was an Italian politician who served as the Prime Minister of Italy from 1980 to 1981. He also held the office of Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Defence.

A member of the right-wing faction of the Christian Democracy (DC) party, Forlani was one of the most prominent Italian politicians from the 1970s to early 1990s. He led the DC party on two occasions: between 1969 and 1973, and between 1989 and 1992. Forlani&#x27;s permiership, which lasted less than a year, was strongly marked by the 1980 Irpinia earthquake and the P2 lodge scandal, the latter causing his resignation in June 1981. 

In 1981, together with Bettino Craxi and Giulio Andreotti, he promoted the Pentapartito, the political coalition between the three major Italian parties that ruled Italy between 1981 and 1991. At the time of his death in 2023, he was both the oldest living and the longest-lived Italian prime minister.

==Early life and career==
Forlani was born on 8 December 1925, in Pesaro, Marche. As a youth he played as a midfielder for Vis Pesaro, in the Serie C of the Italian soccer league. In 1948, after getting a degree in law at the University of Urbino and being elected comunal and provincial councilor, Forlani began his political career, holding the position of provincial secretary of Christian Democracy (DC) for Pesaro. 

In 1954 he became a member of the central committee of Christian Democracy, as member of the right-wing faction. The following year, Forlani became director of the party&#x27;s section &quot;Studi, Propaganda e Stampa&quot; (S.P.E.S). In the 1958 Italian general election, Forlani was elected in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time. Forlani soon became one of the closest collaborators of Amintore Fanfani, as an exponent of the &quot;Nuove Cronache&quot; DC current, of which Forlani became its number two in 1959. 

In 1962, he was elected national vicesecretary of Christian Democracy, under Aldo Moro&#x27;s leadership. He held this position for seven years, until 1969, under the secretariat of Mariano Rumor and Flaminio Piccoli.

==Secretary of the Christian Democratic party==

When Mariano Rumor became Prime Minister in December 1968, he appointed Forlani as Minister of Public Shares and in August 1969 he became Minister for the Relations with the United Nations, in the Rumor&#x27;s second cabinet.

In September 1969, in San Ginesio he stipulated, together with Ciriaco de Mita, the &quot;Pact of San Ginesio&quot; to lead the Christian Democracy party, which materialized when two months later, on 9 November 1969, Forlani became Secretary of the DC and De Mita, its vice-secretary. Forlani assumed the leadership of the party in a moment of social instability provoked by the mobilizations in the universities and factories, for which he drafted the &quot;Preambolo&quot;, to ask the Italian Socialist Party to be part of a center-left government in order to break all relations with the communists in the municipal administrations and the trade unions. 

The DC&#x27;s comfortable victory in the regional elections of 1970, with 37% of the vote nationwide and victory in all regions except three, did not allow Forlani to achieve that DC&#x27;s candidate for the presidential elections the following year, Amintore Fanfani, gain enough confidence of the Chamber of Deputies. Forlani&#x27;s second candidate was Aldo Moro, but also this nomination was rejected by the Parliament. At the end, the DC proposed Giovanni Leone, former prime minister and long-time president of the Chamber of Deputies, who was elected with the support of the neo-fascist Social Movement.

In the snap general elections of 1972, which took place on 7 May, the advance of the right in the country was stopped, remaining stable with around 38% of the votes.

His former mentor, Amintore Fanfani, succeeded Farloni as secretary of the DC in the 1973 party&#x27;s Congress.

Three years later, in 1976, Farloni tried to regain the party&#x27;s secretariat as representative of the moderate internal current against the pacts with the Communist Party, but was defeated by Benigno Zaccagnini, who represented the more left-wing bloc.

==Member of the government==
Between 1974 and 1976, Forlani was Minister of Defence.

When the Republicans left Moro&#x27;s cabinet in 1976, no possibilities of a new government remained, and an early vote was called. After the election, which saw a great success of the Communist Party, Andreotti became the new prime minister and Forlani was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs.

The reasons of this important nomination were firstly the necessity to recover a climate of unity in the party after the congressional divisions and secondly the opportunity, in a world still marked by the Cold War, to allocate foreign policy to a clearly anti-communist personality, as Forlani was, able to calm the European and U.S.
partners. During his ministry, Forlani strongly supported the European integration process, and the adhesion of Portugal to the European Economic Community.

==Prime Minister of Italy==

In 1980, Forlani was among the main sponsor of Flaminio Piccoli in the party congress. Piccoli was elected Secretary at the head of a centre-right majority. Due to his fundamental role in Piccoli&#x27;s election, Forlani was appointed Prime Minister of Italy in October, leading a centre to centre-left coalition with PSI, PSDI and PRI.

===1980 Irpinia earthquake===

During his premiership, Forlani had to face also the Irpinia earthquake, a strong shock, that was centered on the village of Conza in Campania, and left at least 2,483 people dead, at least 7,700 injured, and left 250,000 homeless.

Forlani&#x27;s government spent 59 trillion lire on reconstruction, while other nations sent contributions. West Germany contributed 32 million United States dollars (USD) and the United States US$70 million. However, in the early 1990s a major corruption scandal emerged. Of the billions of lire that were predestined for aid to the victims and rebuilding, the largest part disappeared from the earthquake reconstruction funds in the 1980s. Of the $40 billion spent on earthquake reconstruction, an estimated $20 billion went to create an entirely new social class of millionaires in the region, $6.4 billion went to the Camorra, whereas another $4 billion went to politicians in bribes. Only the remaining $9.6 billion a quarter of the total amount, was actually spent on people&#x27;s needs. Moreover, the Mafia entered the construction industry after the quake.

===P2 scandal and resignation===
During his premiership, the list of who belonged to the secret lodge P2 was published. The P2 was a Masonic lodge founded in 1945 that, by the time its Masonic charter was withdrawn in 1976, had transformed into a clandestine, pseudo-Masonic, ultraright organization operating in contravention of Article 18 of the Constitution of Italy that banned secret associations. In its latter period, during which the lodge was headed by Licio Gelli, P2 was implicated in numerous Italian crimes and mysteries, including the collapse of the Vatican-affiliated Banco Ambrosiano, the murders of journalist Mino Pecorelli and banker Roberto Calvi, and corruption cases within the nationwide bribe scandal Tangentopoli. P2 came to light through the investigations into the collapse of Michele Sindona&#x27;s financial empire.

P2 was sometimes referred to as a &quot;state within a state&quot; or a &quot;shadow government&quot;. The lodge had among its members prominent journalists, Members of Parliament, industrialists, and military leaders—including Silvio Berlusconi, who later became Prime Minister of Italy; the Savoy pretender to the Italian throne Victor Emmanuel; and the heads of all three Italian intelligence services (at the time SISDE, SISMI, and CESIS).

When searching Gelli&#x27;s villa in 1981, the police found a document called the &quot;Plan for Democratic Rebirth&quot;, which called for a consolidation of the media, suppression of trade unions, and the rewriting of the Italian Constitution. However, the lateness with which they were published gained Forlani heavy criticism, in particular from the Communist Party. He was therefore compelled to resign from the position, staying away from the spotlight of politics for a certain period. With his resignation and the appointment of Republican leader Giovanni Spadolini, the unbroken line since 1945 of Christian Democratic Prime Ministers came to an end.

==After the premiership==

In 1981, at a Socialist Congress, Forlani and Socialist leader Bettino Craxi signed an agreement with the &quot;blessing&quot; of Giulio Andreotti, in which began the so-called Pentapartito.

In 1982, Forlani tried again to become DC Secretary, but he was defeated by his former deputy secretary Ciriaco De Mita, who was now supported also by Fanfani. In 1983 the Socialist leader Bettino Craxi was appointed prime minister by President Sandro Pertini and Forlani became his deputy prime minister.

==Second term as secretary==
In the 18th DC National Congress Forlani was elected secretary for a second time, with 85% of votes. He managed as secretary the long government crisis that followed the 19 May 1989 resignation of Ciriaco de Mita as prime minister after strong contrasts with Bettino Craxi. 

In July, the sixth Andreotti government took office and, after the good results of the DC in the 1989 European Parliament election, promoted the so-called &quot;C.A.F.&quot; political alliance, to shield the Pentapartito and whose initials correspond to the initials of Craxi, Andreotti and Forlani, which was the pivot of Italian politics for the remaining part of the legislature until the 1992 election.

He was Member of the European Parliament in its third legislature, between 1989 and 1994.

===1992 election and presidential ambitions===
Forlani, at the end of 1991, convened the National Programmatic Conference of the DC in Milan in which he warned that the First Republic was collapsing and identified possible, being the reform of the proportional electoral law that included a &#x27;corrective majority&#x27; one of his main remedies. The following year, the Mani Pulite investigation began and, in the 5 April general election, the Christian Democracy 5 April lost 5 points.

In the presidential election of the same year, the Christian Democracy proposed Forlani as its candidate to the presidency of the Republic. However, during the 5th and 6th ballots, held on 16 May 1992, Forlani missed the election by 39 and 29 votes respectively. Following these defeats, Forlani withdrew his candidacy as President of the Republic.

===Judicial case, resignation and decline===
In 1992 he was charged to two years and four months in prison for illicit financing for his involvement in &quot;Mani pulite&quot; scandal. His testimony ended up being remembered for his ruthless and uncooperative response to the prosecuting lawyer&#x27;s questions during the hearings. The sentence was replaced with community service for Caritas in Rome. 

That conviction, added to the failed race for the presidency of the country and the bad results in the 1992 Italian general election, put an end to his political career. Forlani resigned as DC secretary that same year. He did not stand for re-election as deputy in the general election of 1994, ending an uninterrupted parliamentary career that began in 1958.

==Personal life and death==
Forlani married Alma Maria, from whom he was widowed on 6 October 2015 when she died at the age of 86. They had three sons: Alessandro, Marco, and Luigi. Alessandro also had a stint in Italian politics, becoming a deputy and senator.

Forlani died on 6 July 2023 in his house of Rome at the age of 97. 

The government declared two days of mourning, between 8 and 10 July, and announced a state funeral that took place on 10 July in Rome&#x27;s Santi Pietro e Paolo a Via Ostiense basilica.
