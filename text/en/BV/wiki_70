<text>The Omega Men are a fictional team of extraterrestrial superheroes who have appeared in various comic book series published by DC Comics. They first appeared in &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (vol. 2) #141 (June 1981), and were created by Marv Wolfman and Joe Staton.

==Publication history==
After appearances in &quot;Green Lantern&quot;, &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot;, the Omega Men were featured in their own comics series which ran for 38 issues from April 1983 to May 1986. During its run, writer Roger Slifer and artist Keith Giffen created the mercenary anti-hero Lobo. Later creators included writers Doug Moench and Todd Klein (who also lettered later issues in the run), artists Tod Smith, Shawn McManus and Alex Niño, and inkers Mike DeCarlo, Jim McDermott and Greg Theakston.

Members of the Omega Men also appeared in the 2004 eight-issue &quot;Adam Strange&quot; limited series, as well as the 2005 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; lead-in 6-issue limited series, &quot;Rann-Thanagar War&quot; and the 2008 follow-up &quot;Rann-Thanagar Holy War&quot;.

In 2006 they had their own six issue limited series with Tigorr, Doc, Elu, Broot and Ryand&#x27;r - written by Andersen Gabrych and art by Henry Flint.

==Fictional team history==
The Omega Men hail from the Vega system, a planetary system with twenty-five habitable planets, which had been ruled for millennia by the Citadelians, a race of warriors cloned from the First Citadelian, the demi-godlike son of X&#x27;Hal.
The Citadelians established a tyrannical regime based in a fortress moon known as the Citadel. The Citadel then set about to conquer the younger races of Vega. Originally there were only two races in the Vegan system, the Branx and the Okaarans, but the Psions used Okaaran DNA to create the other twenty-three races of Vega such as the Tamaraneans, Euphorixians, Aelloans, Karnans, and the Changralyns.

The Omega Men were assembled as a group of renegades and representatives of conquered Vegan worlds to fight Citadelian aggression. Pre-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; the team was based on the planet Kuraq. The Omega Men are important peacekeepers in their sector because the Green Lantern Corps is not allowed into Vegan space, due to a long-standing agreement with the Psions.

The Omega Men made a return appearance in the &quot;Adam Strange&quot; mini-series. Still led by Tigorr, with veteran members Broot, Doc, Elu, Artin and Harpis. They were joined by a group of new members whose names were given, but not identified in the book. They were still fighting the Spider Empire. A vision by one of their new members, a precog, results in them waiting in a Rannian space station for some time; their ultimate purpose to meet Adam Strange. It was in this storyline that the first Doc is discovered to be a Durlan assassin. Doc himself is presumed slain.

In the recent &quot;Omega Men&quot; mini-series, it had been revealed that upon returning to the remains of Tamaran with Ryand&#x27;r (who was not part of the team in the Adam Strange mini-series), the Omegans are attacked by the Darkstar zombies of Lady Styx and all but five of them died.

The Omega Men have been seen fleeing L.E.G.I.O.N. robots during a hostile takeover ousting Vril Dox.

==DC You==
In 2015, as part of the &quot;DC You&quot; revamp of the DC Comics, a new &quot;Omega Men&quot; series was launched. The new series, which lasted 12 issues, retroactively replaced the previous &quot;New 52&quot; Omega group in canon.

The series, written by Tom King, rebooted the entire story of the Omega Men. In the new canon, the Citadel is now an interplanetary corporation. The Citadel, exploiting the chaos from the destruction of Krypton, has begun selling thousands of worlds rare metal that can be used to &quot;stabilize planetary cores&quot; to prevent a world from exploding ala Krypton. The rare, planetary core stabilizing metal, is only available in the Vega Star system. The planets of the Vega Star system as a result, have been wholesale enslaved by the alien corporation. Several worlds, whose inhabitants resisted the Citadal, were subjected to genocide: survivors of the genocide from these worlds, became the Omega Men. The group is led by Primus, recast as a wealthy pacifist who was imprisoned by the Citadel to silence him.

Due to the power and influence over thousands of worlds, the Citadel has framed the Omega Men as terrorists and murderers. The reach of the Citadel even ascends to Earth: after making contact with the US Military, to broker a deal to sell them metal from the Vega Star System, the US Government secretly sends Kyle Rayner to broker a deal with the Citadel at the start of the twelve issue series. However, the head of the Citadel corporation forces Kyle to surrender his white power ring upon meeting him (for &quot;security&quot; reasons; in truth, due to him coveting the ring for his own selfish desires). Shortly afterwards, Kyle is kidnapped by the Omega Men, who fake his death and then force Kyle to join them on a tour of the Vega Star System so he could see the evil of the Citadel and expose their sins.

Kyle eventually realizes the truth about the Citadel and with the Omega Men&#x27;s help, crash an interview with the head of the Citadel, in order to air recorded footage of the Citadel destroying an entire populated planet that had been mined dry of the rare metal. The move clears the Omega Men&#x27;s good name but fails to stop the Citadel&#x27;s activities in the Vega Star System. A final battle between the Citadel and the Omega Men then ensues, ending in the death of the Citadel&#x27;s leadership caste. Meanwhile, Kyle, who had assumed the alias of &quot;Green Man&quot; during the time with the Omega Men, regains his White Lantern ring and is ultimately banished back to Earth by the Omega Men when he fails to convince them to spare the leaders of the Citadel.

<doc id="625220" wikidata="Q1320719" url="?curid=625220" title="Proglacial lake">
<text>In geology, a proglacial lake is a lake formed either by the damming action of a moraine during the retreat of a melting glacier, a glacial ice dam, or by meltwater trapped against an ice sheet due to isostatic depression of the crust around the ice. At the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago, large proglacial lakes were a widespread feature in the northern hemisphere.

==Moraine-dammed==


The receding glaciers of the tropical Andes have formed a number of proglacial lakes, especially in the Cordillera Blanca of Peru, where 70% of all tropical glaciers are. Several such lakes have formed rapidly during the 20th century. These lakes may burst, creating a hazard for zones below. Many natural dams (usually moraines) containing the lake water have been reinforced with safety dams. Some 34 such dams have been built in the Cordillera Blanca to contain proglacial lakes. 

Several proglacial lakes have also formed in recent decades at the end of glaciers on the eastern side of New Zealand&#x27;s Southern Alps. The most accessible, Lake Tasman, hosts boat trips for tourists.

On a smaller scale, a mountain glacier may excavate a depression forming a cirque, which may contain a mountain lake, called a tarn, upon the melting of the glacial ice.

==Ice-dammed==
The movement of a glacier may flow down a valley to a confluence where the other branch carries an unfrozen river. The glacier blocks the river, which backs up into a proglacial lake, which eventually overflows or undermines the ice dam, suddenly releasing the impounded water in a glacial lake outburst flood also known by its Icelandic name a jökulhlaup. Some of the largest glacial floods in North American history were from Lake Agassiz. In modern times, the Hubbard Glacier regularly blocks the mouth of Russell Fjord at 60° north on the coast of Alaska.

A similar event takes place after irregular periods in the Perito Moreno Glacier, located in Patagonia. Roughly every four years the glacier forms an ice dam against the rocky coast, causing the waters of the Lago Argentino to rise. When the water pressure is too high, then the giant bridge collapses in what has become a major tourist attraction. This sequence occurred last on 4 March 2012, the previous having taken place four years before, in July 2008.

About 13,000 years ago in North America, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet crept southward into the Idaho Panhandle, forming a large ice dam that blocked the mouth of the Clark Fork River, creating a massive lake deep and containing more than of water. Finally this Glacial Lake Missoula burst through the ice dam and exploded downstream, flowing at a rate 10 times the combined flow of all the rivers of the world. Because such ice dams can re-form, these Missoula Floods happened at least 59 times, carving Dry Falls below Grand Coulee.

In some cases, such lakes gradually evaporated during the warming period after the Quaternary ice age. In other cases, such as Glacial Lake Missoula and Glacial Lake Wisconsin in the United States, the sudden rupturing of the supporting dam caused glacial lake outburst floods, the rapid and catastrophic release of dammed water resulting in the formation of gorges and other structures downstream from the former lake. Good examples of these structures can be found in the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington, an area heavily eroded by the Missoula Floods.

The following table is a partial list of rivers that had glacial ice dams.

==Retreating ice sheet==

The retreating glaciers of the last ice age, both depressed the terrain with their mass and provided a source of meltwater that was confined against the ice mass. Lake Algonquin is an example of a proglacial lake that existed in east-central North America at the time of the last ice age. Parts of the former lake are now Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, Lake Superior, Lake Michigan and inland portions of northern Michigan. Examples in Great Britain include Lake Lapworth, Lake Harrison and Lake Pickering. Ironbridge Gorge in Shropshire and Hubbard&#x27;s Hills in Lincolnshire are examples of a glacial overspill channel created when the water of a proglacial lake rose high enough to breach the lowest point in the containing watershed.

<doc id="625223" wikidata="Q3414055" url="?curid=625223" title="Queequeg">
<text>Queequeg is a character in the 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; by American author Herman Melville. The story outlines his royal, Polynesian descent, as well as his desire to &quot;visit Christendom&quot; that led him to leave his homeland. Queequeg is visually distinguished by his striking facial tattoos and tan skin. Ishmael encounters Queequeg in Chapter Three and they become unlikely friends. Once aboard the whaling ship the &quot;Pequod&quot;, Queequeg becomes the harpooner for the mate Starbuck.

== Familial and cultural history ==
Queequeg is native to the fictional island of Kokovoko (also known as Rokovoko), an &quot;island far away to the West and South&quot;, or more specifically in the South Pacific Ocean. He was the son of High Chief, King as well various other well-respected individuals of his community. Queequeg&#x27;s culture is referenced to be cannibalistic. The narration of the book makes it clear that cannibalism was not universally accepted at this time.

In the novel, Queequeg is described as having an &quot;ambitious soul&quot; who had a strong &quot;desire to visit Christendom&quot;. Queequeg left home when he snuck onto a Sag Harbor ship that was passing by his father&#x27;s land. At first rejected by the whaler that landed on his island, he skillfully jumped from a canoe and clamped to the side of the boat as it was leaving for the open sea, at which point the captain relented. He was trained as a whaleman during this time and continued in this profession going forward.

Despite his interest in &quot;Christendom&quot;, Queequeg practiced a pagan religion. Queequeg practices a form of animism using a small idol named Yojo, for whom he builds small ceremonial fires. As part of his religion, he practices a prolonged period of fasting and silence (which Ishmael calls his &quot;Ramadan&quot;). In chapter seventeen, Queequeg locks himself in his room in Nantucket to keep his fast and silence. Even after Ishmael enters the room, Queequeg is unbothered and does not acknowledge Ishmael&#x27;s presence.

== Queequeg&#x27;s tattoos ==
In her book, &quot;Tattooing the World&quot;, author Juniper Ellis contemplates the significance of Queequeg&#x27;s face and bodily markings. Ellis claims that Melville was inspired by a representation of the Māori Chief Te Pēhi Kupe in George Lillie Craik&#x27;s book, &quot;The New Zealanders&quot;. Records indicate that Melville&#x27;s encounter with Craik&#x27;s book in 1850 caused him to replace Bulkington (the originally intended companion of Ishmael) with a new character: Queequeg.

While the descriptions of Queequeg&#x27;s tattoos are dissimilar to those of the Māori Chief, Ellis claims that Melville took inspiration from Te Pēhi Kupe. The parallels and distinctions between his source of inspiration are important to Ellis&#x27;s interpretation of Queequeg. Although they are similar, Queequeg&#x27;s tattoos are described in the text as more geometric and square-shaped than the Māori tattoos that are often &quot;rounded into spirals&quot;. Because the historical evidence points to Craik&#x27;s book as an inspiration for Melville, Ellis argues that these tattoos similarly indicate genealogy, family, and individual identities. Additionally, she believes that these parallels create a stronger link between Queequeg and Pacific origin cultures.

== Relationship with Ishmael ==
Queequeg and Ishmael first meet in New Bedford, Massachusetts when Ishmael and he are placed in the same room of The Spouter-Inn. At this moment, Queequeg had just returned from a whaling voyage and Ishmael was staying the night on the way towards a voyage as well. Queequeg returns late to the inn, not knowing that Ishmael has been booked into the same room with him. Ishmael is at first afraid of this unfamiliar person who he must share a bed with, however, he keeps an open mind. He quickly comes to the conclusion that &quot;for all his tattooings he [Queequeg] was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal.&quot;

Chapter Four begins with Queequeg&#x27;s arm &quot;thrown over&quot; Ishmael in his sleep. This scene is an abrupt, striking contrast to the previous chapter in which Queequeg threatens to kill Ishmael. Ishmael states that &quot;You had almost thought I had been his wife.&quot; Soon after, in Chapter 10, Queequeg proclaims that they are married, which in his country implies that they are &quot;bosom friends&quot;.

Steven B. Herrmann analyzes this relationship in his journal article &quot;Melville&#x27;s Portrait of Same-Sex Marriage in Moby-Dick.&quot; Herrmann believes that the &quot;Ishmael-Queequeg &#x27;marriage&#x27;...is the first portrait of same-sex marriage in American literature.&quot; He sees the physical affection between the two characters as Melville moving beyond the &quot;cultural imprints of homophobia&quot; in literature. Regardless of Herrmann&#x27;s beliefs, it cannot be confirmed whether Melville intended for this to be a homosexual relationship; Melville leaves this interpretation to the reader.

== Queequeg&#x27;s coffin ==
Toward the end of the novel Queequeg falls ill and is presumed to die. In chapter 110, Queequeg expresses his desire to not be buried in his hammock, &quot;according to the usual sea-custom&quot;, but rather that a canoe-like coffin be made for him when he dies. Sickness does not overtake Queequeg. While he recovers from his illness, he does die by other means in the end. He does not survive the Pequod&#x27;s wreck as Ishmael is the only survivor. Still, he is ultimately responsible for saving Ishmael&#x27;s life from beyond the grave. Ishmael survives the wreck by clinging to the coffin that had been made for Queequeg.

Michael C. Berthold&#x27;s journal article titled &quot;Moby-Dick and American Slave Narrative&quot; from the &quot;Massachusetts Review&quot; outline&#x27;s one idea regarding the symbolic meaning of Queeqeug&#x27;s coffin. When Queequeg heals and is no longer presumed to die in chapter 110, the book mentions how he spent many hours &quot;carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings...to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body.&quot; In his article, Berthold says that because of the tattoos carved into it, the coffin is &quot;Queequeg&#x27;s sacred text and co-extensive with his own body.&quot; Berthold sees this moment as in contrast to chapter 18 when Captain Peleg mislabels him as Quohog in the forms enrolling him to work on the ship. Queequeg is unable to correct Peleg&#x27;s mistake because he cannot read or write. He is only able to sign the document with a mark that replicates one tattoo on his right arm. Dissimilarly, Berthold mentions that the coffin allows for Queequeg to &quot;reproduce his entire body&quot; in terms of tattoos. Berthold sees this full representation of Queequeg&#x27;s tattoos on the coffin as a reclamation of &quot;the wholeness that the official discourse of a Peleg denies him&quot; previously in chapter 18.

== Race through Queequeg ==
In her journal article &quot;&#x27;Defamiliarization&#x27; and the Ideology of Race in &#x27;Moby Dick&#x27;&quot;, Martha Vick states that the &quot;use of language to acknowledge equality [specifically in descriptions of Queequeg] bestows the highest dignity possible on a nonwhite character at the same time that it calls into question the use of racial characteristics as criteria for determining identity.&quot; For example, Ishmael initially describes Queequeg as a cannibal and a savage, but soon realizes that his appearances are misleading. Vick believes that Ishmael&#x27;s consideration of Queequeg that contrasts the &quot;illusion of his darkness&quot; with the &quot;reality of his goodness&quot; promotes questioning of the traditional ideas of the racial hierarchy. Vick mentions how Ishmael then states that &quot;a man can be honest in any sort of skin&quot;, which contributes to her argument that Melville&#x27;s language encourages a new and just way of thinking.

At one point in chapter 10, Ishmael describes Queequeg as having &quot;large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold... He looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor... His [Queequeg&#x27;s] forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would.&quot; Ishmael goes on to equate this description of Queequeg to George Washington&#x27;s head. Ishmael states: &quot;It had the same long regularly graded retreating, like two long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.&quot;

== Skills and interests ==
In Chapter Three, Queequeg stays out late selling human heads from New Zealand.

He is an extraordinary harpooner, demonstrating his skill for the money-tight owners of the &quot;Pequod&quot; by striking a small drop of tar floating on the water with one throw. The owners are so impressed that they immediately offer him a 90th lay ( of the ship&#x27;s profit) in exchange for his signing on with the crew. By contrast, Ishmael (who has experience in the merchant marine but none as a whaler) is initially offered a 777th lay but eventually secures a 300th. In port, Queequeg carries his sharpened harpoon with him at all times, unless prevented from doing so. He shaves with his harpoon as well and smokes regularly from a tomahawk that he carries with him.

<text>A reversible reaction is a reaction in which the conversion of reactants to products and the conversion of products to reactants occur simultaneously.

:&lt;chem&gt; \mathit aA{} + \mathit bB &lt;=&gt; \mathit cC{} + \mathit dD&lt;/chem&gt;

A and B can react to form C and D or, in the reverse reaction, C and D can react to form A and B. This is distinct from a reversible process in thermodynamics.

Weak acids and bases undergo reversible reactions. For example, carbonic acid: 

: H2CO3 (l) + H2O(l) ⇌ HCO3−(aq) + H3O+(aq).

The concentrations of reactants and products in an equilibrium mixture are determined by the analytical concentrations of the reagents (A and B or C and D) and the equilibrium constant, &quot;K&quot;. The magnitude of the equilibrium constant depends on the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. So, when the free energy change is large (more than about 30 kJ mol−1), the equilibrium constant is large (log K &gt; 3) and the concentrations of the reactants at equilibrium are very small. Such a reaction is sometimes considered to be an irreversible reaction, although small amounts of the reactants are still expected to be present in the reacting system. A truly irreversible chemical reaction is usually achieved when one of the products exits the reacting system, for example, as does carbon dioxide (volatile) in the reaction
: CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + H2O + CO2↑
== History ==

The concept of a reversible reaction was introduced by Claude Louis Berthollet in 1803, after he had observed the formation of sodium carbonate crystals at the edge of a salt lake (one of the natron lakes in Egypt, in limestone):

:2NaCl + CaCO3 → Na2CO3 + CaCl2

He recognized this as the reverse of the familiar reaction
: Na2CO3 + CaCl2→ 2NaCl + CaCO3

Until then, chemical reactions were thought to always proceed in one direction. Berthollet reasoned that the excess of salt in the lake helped push the &quot;reverse&quot; reaction towards the formation of sodium carbonate.

In 1864, Peter Waage and Cato Maximilian Guldberg formulated their law of mass action which quantified Berthollet&#x27;s observation. Between 1884 and 1888, Le Chatelier and Braun formulated Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle, which extended the same idea to a more general statement on the effects of factors other than concentration on the position of the equilibrium.

== Reaction kinetics ==
For the reversible reaction A⇌B, the forward step A→B has a rate constant formula_1 and the backwards step B→A has a rate constant formula_2. The concentration of A obeys the following differential equation:

If we consider that the concentration of product B at anytime is equal to the concentration of reactants at time zero minus the concentration of reactants at time formula_3, we can set up the following equation:

Combining and , we can write

:formula_4.

Separation of variables is possible and using an initial value formula_5, we obtain:

:formula_6

and after some algebra we arrive at the final kinetic expression:

:formula_7.

The concentration of A and B at infinite time has a behavior as follows:

:formula_8

:formula_9

:formula_10

:formula_11

Thus, the formula can be linearized in order to determine formula_12:

:formula_13

To find the individual constants formula_1 and formula_2, the following formula is required:

:formula_16

<doc id="625229" wikidata="Q357519" url="?curid=625229" title="Adipocyte">
<text>Adipocytes, also known as lipocytes and fat cells, are the cells that primarily compose adipose tissue, specialized in storing energy as fat. Adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells which give rise to adipocytes through adipogenesis. In cell culture, adipocyte progenitors can also form osteoblasts, myocytes and other cell types. 

There are two types of adipose tissue, white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), which are also known as white and brown fat, respectively, and comprise two types of fat cells.

== Structure ==
===White fat cells===
White fat cells contain a single large lipid droplet surrounded by a layer of
cytoplasm, and are known as unilocular. The nucleus is flattened and pushed to the periphery. A typical fat cell is 0.1 mm in diameter with some being twice that size, and others half that size. However, these numerical estimates of fat cell size depend largely on the measurement method and the location of the adipose tissue. The fat stored is in a semi-liquid state, and is composed primarily of triglycerides, and cholesteryl ester. White fat cells secrete many proteins acting as adipokines such as resistin, adiponectin, leptin and apelin. An average human adult has 30 billion fat cells with a weight of 30 lbs or 13.5 kg. If a child or adolescent gains sufficient excess weight, fat cells may increase in absolute number until age twenty-four. If an adult (who never was obese as a child or adolescent) gains excess weight, fat cells generally increase in size, not number, though there is some inconclusive evidence suggesting that the number of fat cells might also increase if the existing fat cells become large enough (as in particularly severe levels of obesity). The number of fat cells is difficult to decrease through dietary intervention, though some evidence suggests that the number of fat cells can decrease if weight loss is maintained for a sufficiently long period of time (&gt;1 year; though it is extremely difficult for people with larger and more numerous fat cells to maintain weight loss for that long a time). 

A large meta-analysis has shown that white adipose tissue cell size is dependent on measurement methods, adipose tissue depots, age, and body mass index; for the same degree of obesity, increases in fat cell size were also associated with the dysregulations in glucose and lipid metabolism.

===Brown fat cells===

Brown fat cells are polyhedral in shape. Brown fat is derived from dermatomyocyte cells. Unlike white fat cells, these cells have considerable cytoplasm, with several lipid droplets scattered throughout, and are known as multilocular cells. The nucleus is round and, although eccentrically located, it is not in the periphery of the cell. The brown color comes from the large quantity of mitochondria. Brown fat, also 
known as &quot;baby fat,&quot; is used to generate heat.

===Marrow fat cells===
Marrow adipocytes are unilocular like white fat cells. The marrow adipose tissue depot is poorly understood in terms of its physiologic function and relevance to bone health. Marrow adipose tissue expands in states of low bone density but additionally expands in the setting of obesity. Marrow adipose tissue response to exercise approximates that of white adipose tissue. Exercise reduces both adipocyte size as well as marrow adipose tissue volume, as quantified by MRI or μCT imaging of bone stained with the lipid binder osmium.

==Development==

Pre-adipocytes are undifferentiated fibroblasts that can be stimulated to form adipocytes. Studies have shed light into potential molecular mechanisms in the fate determination of pre-adipocytes although the exact lineage of adipocyte is still unclear. The variation of body fat distribution resulting from normal growth is influenced by nutritional and hormonal status dependent on intrinsic differences in cells found in each adipose depot.

Mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into adipocytes, connective tissue, muscle or bone.

The precursor of the adult cell is termed a lipoblast, and a tumor of this cell type is known as a lipoblastoma.

== Function ==
===Cell turnover===

Fat cells in some mice have been shown to drop in count due to fasting and other properties were observed when exposed to cold.

If the adipocytes in the body reach their maximum capacity of fat, they may replicate to allow additional fat storage.

According to some reports and textbooks, the number of adipocytes can increase in childhood and adolescence, though the amount is usually constant in adults. Individuals who become obese as adults, rather than as adolescents, have no more adipocytes than they had before.

Body fat cells have regional responses to the overfeeding that was studied in adult subjects. In the upper body, an increase of adipocyte size correlated with upper-body fat gain; however, the number of fat cells was not significantly changed. In contrast to the upper body fat cell response, the number of lower-body adipocytes did significantly increase during the course of experiment. Notably, there was no change in the size of the lower-body adipocytes.

Approximately 10% of fat cells are renewed annually at all adult ages and levels of body mass index without a significant increase in the overall number of adipocytes in adulthood.

===Adaptation===
Obesity is characterized by the expansion of fat mass, through adipocyte size increase (hypertrophy) and, to a lesser extent, cell proliferation (hyperplasia). In the fatty tissue of obese individuals, there is increased production of metabolism modulators, such as glycerol, hormones, macrophage-stimulating chemokines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to the development of insulin resistance. Production of these modulators and the resulting pathogenesis of insulin resistance are probably caused by adipocytes as well as immune system macrophages that infiltrate the tissue.

Fat production in adipocytes is strongly stimulated by insulin. By controlling the activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase and the acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzymes, insulin promotes unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. It also promotes glucose uptake and induces SREBF1, which activates the transcription of genes that stimulate lipogenesis.

SREBF1 (sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1) is a transcription factor synthesized as an inactive precursor protein inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by two membrane-spanning helices. Also anchored in the ER membrane is SCAP (SREBF-cleavage activating protein), which binds SREBF1. The SREBF1-SCAP complex is retained in the ER membrane by INSIG1 (insulin-induced gene 1 protein). When sterol levels are depleted, INSIG1 releases SCAP and the SREBF1-SCAP complex can be sorted into transport vesicles coated by the coatomer COPII that are exported to the Golgi apparatus. In the Golgi apparatus, SREBF1 is cleaved and released as a transcriptionally active mature protein. It is then free to translocate to the nucleus and activate the expression of its target genes.

Clinical studies have repeatedly shown that even though insulin resistance is usually associated with obesity, the membrane phospholipids of the adipocytes of obese patients generally still show an increased degree of fatty acid unsaturation. This seems to point to an adaptive mechanism that allows the adipocyte to maintain its functionality, despite the increased storage demands associated with obesity and insulin resistance.

A study conducted in 2013 found that, while INSIG1 and SREBF1 mRNA expression was decreased in the adipose tissue of obese mice and humans, the amount of active SREBF1 was increased in comparison with normal mice and non-obese patients. This downregulation of INSIG1 expression combined with the increase of mature SREBF1 was also correlated with the maintenance of SREBF1-target gene expression. Hence, it appears that, by downregulating INSIG1, there is a resetting of the INSIG1/SREBF1 loop, allowing for the maintenance of active SREBF1 levels. This seems to help compensate for the anti-lipogenic effects of insulin resistance and thus preserve adipocyte fat storage abilities and availability of appropriate levels of fatty acid unsaturation in face of the nutritional pressures of obesity.

===Endocrine role===
Adipocytes can synthesize estrogens from androgens, potentially being the reason why being underweight or overweight are risk factors for infertility. Additionally, adipocytes are responsible for the production of the hormone leptin. Leptin is important in regulation of appetite and acts as a satiety factor.

<doc id="625232" wikidata="Q899274" url="?curid=625232" title="Skeletal formula">
<text>The skeletal formula, line-angle formula, bond-line formula or shorthand formula of an organic compound is a type of molecular structural formula that serves as a shorthand representation of a molecule&#x27;s bonding and some details of its molecular geometry. A skeletal formula shows the skeletal structure or skeleton of a molecule, which is composed of the skeletal atoms that make up the molecule. It is represented in two dimensions, as on a piece of paper. It employs certain conventions to represent carbon and hydrogen atoms, which are the most common in organic chemistry.

An early form of this representation was first developed by organic chemist August Kekulé, while the modern form is closely related to and influenced by the Lewis structure of molecules and their valence electrons. Hence they are sometimes termed Kekulé structures or Lewis–Kekulé structures. Skeletal formulae have become ubiquitous in organic chemistry, partly because they are relatively quick and simple to draw, and also because the curved arrow notation used for discussions of reaction mechanisms and electron delocalization can be readily superimposed. 

Several other ways of depicting chemical structures are also commonly used in organic chemistry (though less frequently than skeletal formulae). For example, conformational structures look similar to skeletal formulae and are used to depict the approximate positions of atoms in 3D space, as a perspective drawing. Other types of representation, such as Newman projection, Haworth projection or Fischer projection, also look somewhat similar to skeletal formulae. However, there are slight differences in the conventions used, and the reader needs to be aware of them in order to understand the structural details encoded in the depiction. While skeletal and conformational structures are also used in organometallic and inorganic chemistry, the conventions employed also differ somewhat.

==The skeleton==

=== Terminology ===
The skeletal structure of an organic compound is the series of atoms bonded together that form the essential structure of the compound. The skeleton can consist of chains, branches and/or rings of bonded atoms. Skeletal atoms other than carbon or hydrogen are called heteroatoms.

The skeleton has hydrogen and/or various substituents bonded to its atoms. Hydrogen is the most common non-carbon atom that is bonded to carbon and, for simplicity, is not explicitly drawn. In addition, carbon atoms are not generally labelled as such directly (i.e. with &quot;C&quot;), whereas heteroatoms are always explicitly noted as such (&quot;N&quot; for nitrogen, &quot;O&quot; for oxygen, etc.)

Heteroatoms and other groups of atoms that give rise to relatively high rates of chemical reactivity, or introduce specific and interesting characteristics in the spectra of compounds are called functional groups, as they give the molecule a function. Heteroatoms and functional groups are collectively called &quot;substituents&quot;, as they are considered to be a substitute for the hydrogen atom that would be present in the parent hydrocarbon of the organic compound.

===Basic structure===
As in Lewis structures, covalent bonds are indicated by line segments, with a doubled or tripled line segment indicating double or triple bonding, respectively. Likewise, skeletal formulae indicate formal charges associated with each atom (although lone pairs are usually optional, &quot;see below&quot;). In fact, skeletal formulae can be thought of as abbreviated Lewis structures that observe the following simplifications:
*Carbon atoms are represented by the vertices (intersections or termini) of line segments. For clarity, methyl groups are often explicitly written out as Me or CH3, while (hetero)cumulene carbons are frequently represented by a heavy center dot. 
* Hydrogen atoms attached to carbon are implied. An unlabeled vertex is understood to represent a carbon attached to the number of hydrogens required to satisfy the octet rule, while a vertex labeled with a formal charge and/or nonbonding electron(s) is understood to have the number of hydrogen atoms required to give the carbon atom these indicated properties. Optionally, acetylenic and formyl hydrogens can be shown explicitly for the sake of clarity.
* Hydrogen atoms attached to a heteroatom are shown explicitly. The heteroatom and hydrogen atoms attached thereto are usually shown as a single group (e.g., OH, NH2) without explicitly showing the hydrogen–heteroatom bond. Heteroatoms with simple alkyl or aryl substituents, like methoxy (OMe) or dimethylamino (NMe2), are sometimes shown in the same way, by analogy. 
* Lone pairs on carbene carbons must be indicated explicitly while lone pairs in other cases are optional and are shown only for emphasis. In contrast, formal charges and unpaired electrons on main-group elements are always explicitly shown.

In the standard depiction of a molecule, the canonical form (resonance structure) with the greatest contribution is drawn. However, the skeletal formula is understood to represent the &quot;real molecule&quot; that is, the weighted average of all contributing canonical forms. Thus, in cases where two or more canonical forms contribute with equal weight (e.g., in benzene, or a carboxylate anion) and one of the canonical forms is selected arbitrarily, the skeletal formula is understood to depict the true structure, containing equivalent bonds of fractional order, even though the delocalized bonds are depicted as nonequivalent single and double bonds.

=== Contemporary graphical conventions ===
Since skeletal structures were introduced in the latter half of the 19th century, their appearance has undergone considerable evolution. The graphical conventions in use today date to the 1980s. Thanks to the adoption of the ChemDraw software package as a &quot;de facto&quot; industry standard (by American Chemical Society, Royal Society of Chemistry, and Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker publications, for instance), these conventions have been nearly universal in the chemical literature since the late 1990s. A few minor conventional variations, especially with respect to the use of stereobonds, continue to exist as a result of differing US, UK and European practice, or as a matter of personal preference. As another minor variation between authors, formal charges can be shown with the plus or minus sign in a circle (⊕, ⊖) or without the circle. The set of conventions that are followed by most authors is given below, along with illustrative examples.
==Implicit carbon and hydrogen atoms==
For example, the skeletal formula of hexane (top) is shown below. The carbon atom labeled C1 appears to have only one bond, so there must also be three hydrogens bonded to it, in order to make its total number of bonds four. The carbon atom labelled C3 has two bonds to other carbons and is therefore bonded to two hydrogen atoms as well. A Lewis structure (middle) and ball-and-stick model (bottom) of the actual molecular structure of hexane, as determined by X-ray crystallography, are shown for comparison.
It does not matter which end of the chain one starts numbering from, as long as consistency is maintained when drawing diagrams. The condensed formula or the IUPAC name will confirm the orientation. Some molecules will become familiar regardless of the orientation.

==Explicit heteroatoms and hydrogen atoms ==
All atoms that are not carbon or hydrogen are signified by their chemical symbol, for instance Cl for chlorine, O for oxygen, Na for sodium, and so forth. In the context of organic chemistry, these atoms are commonly known as heteroatoms (the prefix &quot;hetero-&quot; comes from Greek &quot;ἕτερος&quot; héteros, meaning &quot;other&quot;).

Any hydrogen atoms bonded to heteroatoms &quot;are&quot; drawn explicitly. In ethanol, C2H5OH, for instance, the hydrogen atom bonded to oxygen is denoted by the symbol H, whereas the hydrogen atoms which are bonded to carbon atoms are not shown directly. 

Lines representing heteroatom-hydrogen bonds are usually omitted for clarity and compactness, so a functional group like the hydroxyl group is most often written −OH instead of −O−H. These bonds are sometimes drawn out in full in order to accentuate their presence when they participate in reaction mechanisms.

Shown below for comparison are a skeletal formula (top), its Lewis structure (middle) and its ball-and-stick model (bottom) of the actual 3D structure of the ethanol molecule in the gas phase, as determined by microwave spectroscopy.

==Pseudoelement symbols==
There are also symbols that appear to be chemical element symbols, but represent certain very common substituents or indicate an unspecified member of a group of elements. These are called pseudoelement symbols or organic elements and are treated like univalent &quot;elements&quot; in skeletal formulae. A list of common pseudoelement symbols:
===General symbols===
*X for any (pseudo)halogen atom (in the related MLXZ notation, X represents a one-electron donor ligand)
*L &quot;or&quot; L&quot;n&quot; for a ligand or ligands (in the related MLXZ notation, L represents a two-electron donor ligand)
*M &quot;or&quot; Met for any metal atom ([M] is used to indicate a ligated metal, ML&quot;n&quot;, when the identities of the ligands are unknown or irrelevant)
*E &quot;or&quot; El for any electrophile (in some contexts, E is also used to indicate any p-block element)
*Nu for any nucleophile
*Z for conjugating electron-withdrawing groups (in the related MLXZ notation, Z represents a zero-electron donor ligand; &quot;in unrelated usage, Z is also an abbreviation for the carboxybenzyl group&quot;.)

*Pr, &quot;n&quot;-Pr, &quot;or&quot; &quot;n&quot;Pr for the (&quot;normal&quot;) propyl group (&quot;Pr is also the symbol for the element praseodymium. However, since the propyl group is monovalent, while praseodymium is nearly always trivalent, ambiguity rarely, if ever, arises in practice.&quot;)
*&quot;i&quot;-Pr &quot;or&quot; &quot;i&quot;Pr for the isopropyl group

*Cy &quot;or&quot; Chx for the cyclohexyl group
*Ad for the 1-adamantyl group
*Tr &quot;or&quot; Trt for the trityl group

===Aromatic and unsaturated substituents===
*Ar for any aromatic substituent &quot;(Ar is also the symbol for the element argon. However, argon is inert under all usual conditions encountered in organic chemistry, so the use of Ar to represent an aryl substituent never causes confusion.)&quot;
*Het for any heteroaromatic substituent
*Bn &quot;or&quot; Bzl for the benzyl group (&quot;not to be confused with Bz for benzoyl group; However, old literature may use Bz for benzyl group.&quot;)
*Dipp for the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group
*Mes for the mesityl group
*Ph, Φ, &quot;or&quot; φ for the phenyl group (&quot;the use of phi for phenyl has been in decline&quot;)
*Tol for the tolyl group, usually the &quot;para&quot; isomer
*Is &quot;or&quot; Tipp for the 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl group (&quot;the former symbol is derived from the synonym&quot; &quot;isityl&quot;)
*An for the anisyl group, usually the &quot;para&quot; isomer (&quot;An is also the symbol for a generic actinoid element. However, since the anisyl group is monovalent, while the actinides are usually divalent, trivalent, or even higher valency, ambiguity rarely, if ever, arises in practice.&quot;)
*Cp for the cyclopentadienyl group (&quot;Cp was the symbol for cassiopeium, a former name for lutetium&quot;)
*Cp* for the pentamethylcyclopentadienyl group
*Vi for the vinyl group (uncommon)

===Functional groups===
*Ac for the acetyl group &quot;(Ac is also the symbol for the element actinium. However, actinium is almost never encountered in organic chemistry, so the use of Ac to represent the acetyl group never causes confusion)&quot;;
*Bz for the benzoyl group; OBz is the benzoate group
*Piv for the pivalyl (&quot;t&quot;-butylcarbonyl) group; OPiv is the pivalate group
*Bt for the 1-benzotriazolyl group
*Im for the 1-imidazolyl group
*NPhth for the phthalimide-1-yl group

===Sulfonyl/sulfonate groups===
Sulfonate esters are often leaving groups in nucleophilic substitution reactions. &quot;See the articles on sulfonyl and sulfonate groups for further information.&quot;
*Bs for the brosyl (&quot;p&quot;-bromobenzenesulfonyl) group; OBs is the brosylate group
*Ms for the mesyl (methanesulfonyl) group; OMs is the mesylate group

*Tf for the triflyl (trifluoromethanesulfonyl) group; OTf is the triflate group
*Nf for the nonaflyl (nonafluorobutanesulfonyl) group, ; ONf is the nonaflate group
*Ts for tosyl (&quot;p-&quot;toluenesulfonyl) group &quot;(Ts is also the symbol for the element tennessine. However, tennessine is too unstable to ever be encountered in organic chemistry, so the use of Ts to represent tosyl never causes confusion)&quot;; OTs is the tosylate group

===Protecting groups===
A protecting group or protective group is introduced into a molecule by chemical modification of a functional group to obtain chemoselectivity in a subsequent chemical reaction, facilitating multistep organic synthesis.
*Boc for the &quot;t-&quot;butoxycarbonyl group
*Cbz &quot;or&quot; Z for the carboxybenzyl group
*Fmoc for the fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl group
*Alloc for the allyloxycarbonyl group
*Troc for the trichloroethoxycarbonyl group
*TMS, TBDMS, TES, TBDPS, TIPS, ... for various silyl ether groups
*PMB for the 4-methoxybenzyl group
*MOM for the methoxymethyl group
*THP for the 2-tetrahydropyranyl group

==Multiple bonds==
Two atoms can be bonded by sharing more than one pair of electrons. The common bonds to carbon are single, double and triple bonds. Single bonds are most common and are represented by a single, solid line between two atoms in a skeletal formula. Double bonds are denoted by two parallel lines, and triple bonds are shown by three parallel lines.

In more advanced theories of bonding, non-integer values of bond order exist. In these cases, a combination of solid and dashed lines indicate the integer and non-integer parts of the bond order, respectively.

==Benzene rings==

In recent years, benzene is generally depicted as a hexagon with alternating single and double bonds, much like the structure Kekulé originally proposed in 1872. As mentioned above, the alternating single and double bonds of &quot;1,3,5-cyclohexatriene&quot; are understood to be a drawing of one of the two equivalent canonical forms of benzene (the one explicitly shown and the one with the opposite pattern of formal single and double bonds), in which all carbon–carbon bonds are of equivalent length and have a bond order of exactly 1.5. For aryl rings in general, the two analogous canonical forms are almost always the primary contributors to the structure, but they are nonequivalent, so one structure may make a slightly greater contribution than the other, and bond orders may differ somewhat from 1.5.

An alternate representation that emphasizes this delocalization uses a circle, drawn inside the hexagon of single bonds, to represent the delocalized pi orbital. This style, based on one proposed by Johannes Thiele, used to be very common in introductory organic chemistry textbooks and is still frequently used in informal settings. However, because this depiction does not keep track of electron pairs and is unable to show the precise movement of electrons, it has largely been superseded by the Kekuléan depiction in pedagogical and formal academic contexts.
==Stereochemistry==

Stereochemistry is conveniently denoted in skeletal formulae:

The relevant chemical bonds can be depicted in several ways:
* Solid lines represent bonds in the plane of the paper or screen.
* Solid wedges represent bonds that point out of the plane of the paper or screen, towards the observer.
* Hashed wedges or dashed lines (thick or thin) represent bonds that point into the plane of the paper or screen, away from the observer.
* Wavy lines represent either unknown stereochemistry or a mixture of the two possible stereoisomers at that point.
*An obsolescent depiction of hydrogen stereochemistry that used to be common in steroid chemistry is the use of a filled circle centered on a vertex (sometimes called H-dot/H-dash/H-circle, respectively) for an upward pointing hydrogen atom and two hash marks next to vertex or a hollow circle for a downward pointing hydrogen atom. 

An early use of this notation can be traced back to Richard Kuhn who in 1932 used solid thick lines and dotted lines in a publication. The modern solid and hashed wedges were introduced in the 1940s by Giulio Natta to represent the structure of high polymers, and extensively popularised in the 1959 textbook &quot;Organic Chemistry&quot; by Donald J. Cram and George S. Hammond.

Skeletal formulae can depict &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; isomers of alkenes. Wavy single bonds are the standard way to represent unknown or unspecified stereochemistry or a mixture of isomers (as with tetrahedral stereocenters). A crossed double-bond has been used sometimes; it is no longer considered an acceptable style for general use but may still be required by computer software.

==Hydrogen bonds==

Hydrogen bonds are generally denoted by dotted or dashed lines. In other contexts, dashed lines may also represent partially formed or broken bonds in a transition state.

<text>The Kickoff Classic was a season-opening college football game played at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey from 1983 to 2002.

==History==
In 1978, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA), which operated and scheduled events at Giants Stadium, decided to host an end-of-season bowl game, called the Garden State Bowl. There were four such bowl games held, but attendance was lower than hoped by the NJSEA due to December weather and less attractive teams. Consequently, NJSEA decided to host a &quot;bowl&quot; game in the beginning of the season instead. This would attract more popular teams and ensure better attendance due to more favorable weather conditions.

The first contest, held on August 29, 1983, was the first regular-season college football game to be played in the month of August. The game featured the defending national champions Penn State Nittany Lions and the pre-season No. 1 ranked team, the Nebraska Cornhuskers. The game was not carried by any of the networks broadcasting college football at the time; instead, the rights to the game were sold into syndication by Michael Botwinik&#x27;s Katz Communications, and the game aired on various local stations throughout the country. (One of these stations, Philadelphia&#x27;s WKBS, signed off for good right after the game, making the inaugural Kickoff Classic the last program the station carried.)

Eventually there would be twenty Kickoff Classics, many of which were carried by ABC Sports nationally. Participation in the Kickoff Classic allowed teams to play a twelve-game regular season. Rule changes by the NCAA regarding season opening &#x27;extra games&#x27; brought an end to the series in 2002, as well as similar games, such as the west coast-based Pigskin Classic and the midwest-based Eddie Robinson Classic.

In 2008, a new form of kickoff games were born. While not cut from the same mold, the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game held its inaugural game in Atlanta, Georgia in an effort to direct the nation&#x27;s attention to one site for the start of the college football season.

<text>The endodermis is the innermost layer of cortex in land plants. It is a cylinder of compact living cells, the radial walls of which are impregnated with hydrophobic substances (Casparian strip) to restrict apoplastic flow of water to the inside. The endodermis is the boundary between the cortex and the stele.

In many seedless plants, such as ferns, the endodermis is a distinct layer of cells immediately outside the vascular cylinder (stele) in roots and shoots. In most seed plants, especially woody types, the endodermis is present in roots but not in stems.

The endodermis helps regulate the movement of water, ions and hormones into and out of the vascular system. It may also store starch, be involved in perception of gravity and protect the plant against toxins moving into the vascular system.

==Structure==

The endodermis is developmentally the innermost portion of the cortex. It may consist of a single layer of barrel-shaped cells without any intercellular spaces or sometimes several cell layers. The cells of the endodermis typically have their primary cell walls thickened on four sides radial and transverse with suberin, a water-impermeable waxy substance which in young endodermal cells is deposited in distinctive bands called Casparian strips. These strips vary in width but are typically smaller than the cell wall on which they are deposited. If the endodermis is likened to a brick cylinder (e.g. a smokestack), with the bricks representing individual cells, the Casparian strips are analogous to the mortar between the bricks. In older endodermal cells, suberin may be more extensively deposited on all cell wall surfaces and the cells can become lignified, forming a complete waterproof layer.

Some plants have a large number of amyloplasts (starch containing organelles) in their endodermal cells, in which case the endodermis may be called a starch sheath.

Endodermis is often made visible with stains like phloroglucinol due to the phenolic and lipid nature of the Casparian strips or by the abundance of amyloplasts.

==Function==

The endodermis prevents water, and any solutes dissolved in the water, from passing through this layer via the apoplast pathway. Water can only pass through the endodermis by crossing the membrane of endodermal cells twice (once to enter and a second time to exit). Water moving into or out of the xylem, which is part of the apoplast, can thereby be regulated since it must enter the symplast in the endodermis. This allows the plant to control to some degree the movement of water and to selectively uptake or prevent the passage of ions or other molecules.

The endodermis does not allow gas bubbles to enter the xylem and helps prevent embolisms from occurring in the water column.

Passage cells are endodermal cells of older roots which have retained thin walls and Casparian strips rather than becoming suberized and waterproof like the other cells around them, to continue to allow some symplastic flow to the inside. Experimental evidence suggests that passage cells function to allow transfer of solutes such as calcium and magnesium into the stele, in order to eventually reach the transpiration system. For the most part, however, old roots seal themselves off at the endodermis, and only serve as a passageway for water and minerals taken up by younger roots &quot;downstream&quot;.

Endodermal cells may contain starch granules in the form of amyloplasts. These may serve as food storage, and have been shown to be involved in gravitropism in some plants.

<text>A patchwork quilt is a quilt in which the top layer may consist of pieces of fabric sewn together to form a design.
Originally, this was to make full use of leftover scraps of fabric, but now fabric is often bought specially for a specific design. Fabrics are now often sold in quarter meters (or quarter yards in the United States). A &quot;fat quarter&quot; is one square meter (or one yard by the width of the fabric, typically 42–44&quot;) folded into four and cut along the folds, thus giving a relatively square piece of fabric 50 cm on a side, as opposed to buying a quarter of a meter off the roll, resulting in a long thin piece that is only 25 cm wide.

==Design==
Designs can be geometric and formal or imaginative. Patchwork blocks were initially created individually, accumulated over time, by use of scrap and salvaged material. Geometric designs were the most efficient way to aggregate fabric into useful units. Applique, where a piece of fabric is layered on top of the a base or &quot;ground&quot; fabric and then the cut edges are folded under and sewn down, is not limited to simple geometric designs. Early uses of applique in the United States included efforts to expand the effect of expensive, imported European fabrics in early America. The dense printed patterns were cut out, spread apart on a background of plain fabric, allowing the effect of the rare fabric to spread further. Broderie perse is a related technique, where selections of printed fabric are cut out, and sewn in place to produce the effect of a custom printed cloth. Reverse appliqué involves cutting the ground fabric, and placing another fabric beneath the opening. The raw, cut edges are folded under, and sewn onto the smaller piece of fabric below, creating a new design.

Additional design options are provided by quilting techniques that alter the texture of the quilt. These include: trapunto (where additional batting to be sewn through is stuffed into a discrete section of the quilting), cording (where cotton cording or yarn are pulled between quilting lines that form channels), and stipple quilting (where dense, closely spaced quilting causes the batting to be more compressed than it is in adjacent areas). Another, more casual option is to &quot;tie&quot; the quilt. Heavy thread or yarn is used to tie all three layers together at points across the surface of the quilt.

==Layering==
The quilt is formed of three layers: the patchwork quilt top, a layer of insulation wadding (batting), and a layer of backing material. These three layers are stitched together (&quot;quilted&quot;), either by hand or machine. The quilting can either outline the patchwork motifs, or be a completely independent design, for when quilting, the design may not necessarily follow the patchwork design, and the design of the quilting may play off the patchwork design. Outline quilting is when the pieces of the pattern are outlined by the quilting stitches.

==History==
Though quilting has a long history, likely more than five millennia, and takes various forms in many cultures, the block-style patchwork quilt became a &quot;distinct expression&quot; of nineteenth-century America, evolving into a representative folk art of interest to scholars that is still produced today. Eighteenth-century patchwork &quot;was a ladies’ leisure pursuit&quot; in both Europe and North America, with the earliest surviving specimens from Wiltshire in 1718 and Quebec in 1726 made of silk. The lack of information about earlier quilts made of humbler fabric, is partly attributed to such quilts being &quot;intimately connected to everyday life&quot; of the Dutch and English settlers in the New World. As a heritage object with distinctive patterns, the patchwork quilt has come to be particularly associated with Canada and the United States. A twenty-first-century offshoot is the barn quilt.

Quilting was a very popular early American pastime, first in the Midwest, where quilting circles were a common social pastime for women, and later on the Great Plains, especially from 1825 to 1875, where quilting bees, when many women gathered around a quilting frame and quilted, became important social occasions. Such affairs might last overnight and sometimes took on political significance, such as during the movement for abolition. Annual town fairs generally included a quilting prize to award excellence in quilting. Handmade quilts were a very common wedding gift for young couples, and were often mentioned specifically in wills due to their sentimental significance. It was not uncommon, in early American culture, for quilts to reflect a mosaic of a woman&#x27;s life, often including swatches of material from memorable events such as pieces of a wedding gown or a child&#x27;s baptismal garment. The Amish people are famous for their geometric patchwork designs made with solid color fabrics, with independent patterns and quilting; typical motifs include floral designs and heart shapes. The Amish and Mennonite women of the Pennsylvania Dutch country have been creating exquisite quilted masterpieces since the mid-19th century (and some believe even earlier). Amish quilts are an expression of frugality. They not only serve a practical, functional purpose, but serve as a form of entertainment as well.

In 1987 in San Francisco, the Names Project commenced as a memorial to the lives of people who died from AIDS and related diseases with quilt panels made by loved ones. Also known as the AIDS Quilt, it grew to comprise many thousands of panels, and spawned similar projects in countries around the globe. In later years, other subject- and event-specific community-based quilts have been created.

==Colorwash quilting==
This non-traditional method of quilting uses small blocks of color to achieve the look of a watercolor painting where there is no fixed pattern. Fabrics are chosen for their hue and tone.

<text>Lake Wisconsin is a reservoir on the Wisconsin River in southern Wisconsin in the United States. It is located in Columbia and Sauk counties, approximately southeast of Baraboo and NNW of Madison. Today it is home to the Wisconsin wine appellation of the Lake Wisconsin AVA.

It was formed by the construction of the Prairie du Sac Dam, which was begun in 1911 and completed in 1914. It is part of the Wisconsin River system of reservoirs. The lake has a maximum depth of . It has an area of .

Its construction effectively ended the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway connection to the Mississippi River, although commercial traffic had ended decades before completion of the dam.

The lake provides flood control and is a popular destination for recreational boating and fishing.

In 1966, the Wisconsin state record Common Carp was caught in Lake Wisconsin, weighing 57 lbs. 2 oz.

The Merrimac Ferry crosses the lake at Merrimac, Wisconsin.

<doc id="625261" wikidata="Q1823259" url="?curid=625261" title="Lichfield District">
<text>Lichfield District () is a local government district in Staffordshire, England. The district is named after its largest settlement, the city of Lichfield, which is where the district council is based. The district also contains the towns of Burntwood and Fazeley, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas, including part of Cannock Chase, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are Cannock Chase, Stafford, East Staffordshire, South Derbyshire, North West Leicestershire, North Warwickshire, Tamworth, Birmingham and Walsall.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Lichfield Municipal Borough
*Lichfield Rural District (except the parish of Brindley Heath, which went to Cannock Chase)

The borough of Lichfield had held city status from time immemorial. When the new district was created the area of the former borough became an unparished area with charter trustees to preserve its city status and other civic dignities. In 1980 the area of the former borough was made a civil parish, the charter trustees were wound up and the city status was re-conferred onto the new parish of Lichfield. As such, &quot;Lichfield City Council&quot; is a parish council, whilst &quot;Lichfield District Council&quot; is a district council with wider powers and covering the much larger area of Lichfield District.

Between 2011 and 2023, Lichfield formed part of the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership.

==Governance==

Lichfield District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Staffordshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a Conservative minority administration.

The first election to the district council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1977 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, and subsequent changes of allegiance in October 2023, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===

The district council is based at the District Council House on Frog Lane. The building began as Lichfield Grammar School, which had been founded in 1495 and moved to this site in 1577. The oldest surviving part of the complex is the former headmaster&#x27;s house at 45 St John Street, built in 1682. The main school room behind the house was rebuilt in 1849. The school moved to new premises in 1903 and later became the King Edward VI School in 1971. The former school buildings at the corner of St John Street and Frog Lane were bought by Lichfield Rural District Council in 1917 and subsequently converted to be that council&#x27;s offices in 1920. Following the local government reorganisation in 1974 the building passed to the current Lichfield District Council. A large extension was added in 1987 facing Frog Lane, incorporating a new main entrance. The 1849 school room serves as the council chamber.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 47 councillors representing 22 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Wards===
Lichfield District&#x27;s 22 wards are:

==Staffordshire Hoard Discovery==

Discovered in a field near the village of Hammerwich, near Lichfield City, in Staffordshire, on 5 July 2009, the Staffordshire Hoard is the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold and silver metalwork ever found. It consists of nearly 4,000 items that are nearly all martial in character. The artefacts have tentatively been dated to the 7th or 8th centuries, placing the origin of the items in the time of the Kingdom of Mercia.

The hoard was valued at £3.285 million, and was purchased by the Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery and the Potteries Museum &amp; Art Gallery where items from the hoard are displayed.

<text>HMS &quot;Jutland&quot; (D62) was a later or 1943 fleet destroyer of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy. She was named after the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the First World War. The first &quot;Jutland&quot; was launched in 1945, but was cancelled that same year. Her sister ship, &quot;Malplaquet&quot; - named after a battle between Britain and France during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1709 - was renamed &quot;Jutland&quot; just prior to her launch on 20 February 1946, and was commissioned on 30 July 1947. The original &quot;Jutland&quot; was finally broken up in 1957 at Rosyth.

==Service==
In April 1947 she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, September 1948, &quot;Jutland&quot;, in company with the two aircraft carriers and , as well as two of her sister ships and a frigate, deployed on a cruise mainly to South Africa, visiting a number of ports on the way. After the group&#x27;s visit to South Africa, they performed a number of naval exercises before returning to the UK in December.

In April 1950 &quot;Jutland&quot; was temporarily laid-up, but the following year she returned to active service, seeing service with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1952, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron, &quot;Jutland&quot; visited the Middle East, during the troubles in Egypt. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and was subsequently placed in Reserve, along with a number of her sister ships. In 1957, &quot;Jutland&quot; joined the Home and subsequently the Mediterranean Fleets as part of the 7th Destroyer Squadron. The following year, during a daytime exercise off Malta, &quot;Jutland&quot; collided with her sister ship , causing minor damage.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In 1961 &quot;Jutland&quot; was placed in reserve. She was subsequently placed on the disposal list and broken up at Faslane in 1965.

<doc id="625275" wikidata="Q1026666" url="?curid=625275" title="Lydford">
<text>Lydford, sometimes spelled Lidford, is a village and civil parish, in Devon, north of Tavistock on the western fringe of Dartmoor in the West Devon district. The parish covers an area of , and at the 2021 census had a population of 370.

The village is on the small River Lyd, which traverses a deep narrow chasm, crossed by a bridge of single span. Running south-west from the village is Lydford Gorge, a wooded gorge which has been cut through the slate rock by the river, and is noted for its waterfall. The gorge area is owned by the National Trust.

Once an important town, Lydford is noted for its history and surrounding countryside, and has been described as a tourism honeypot.

==Etymology==
The original Anglo-Saxon names for the village were &quot;Hlidaford&quot; or &quot;Hlidan&quot;, from &quot;hlid&quot;, meaning a cover or lid, referring to the almost perfect concealment of the river beneath the chasm at the bridge, and ford (crossing). Over the years the name mutated via &quot;Lyghatford&quot;, &quot;Lidefort&quot; and &quot;Lideford&quot; to the contemporary spelling.

==History==

Historically Lydford was an economic powerhouse, established as one of the four Saxon burhs of Devon by king Alfred the Great. It first appears in recorded history in 997, when the Danes made a plundering expedition up the Tamar and Tavy as far as Hlidaforda (i.e. Lydford). The attack is described in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;:

Translation:

:&quot;In this year, they (the Vikings) visited Devonshire and at the mouth of the Severn, pillaging in Cornwall, Devon and Wales. They went to Watchet, and there caused much damage by dint of arson and wholesale slaughter. Then they turned at Penwith Tail to the south and up into the mouth of the Tamar, travelling to Lydford, burning and slaughtering anything they came across, and burned down Ordwulf&#x27;s monastery at Tavistock, carrying vast amounts of loot back to their ships.&quot;

During the reign of Ethelred the Unready Lydford had a mint; coins minted there were inscribed LVD., LVDA, and LVDAN.
In the reign of Edward the Confessor it was the most populous centre in Devon after Exeter, but Domesday Book relates that forty houses had lain waste since the Norman Conquest. The town never recovered its former prosperity under the Normans and, according to Domesday Book, Lydford was taxed equally with London. Under the Normans, and until the 20th century, the parish of Lydford included all of the Forest of Dartmoor.

Until the 12th century, parishioners from across most of Dartmoor were brought to Lydford for burial. The path used to make this final journey is known as the &#x27;Lych way&#x27;. Many reports have been made of monks in white and phantom funeral processions seen walking along this path.
Lydford Castle is first mentioned in 1216, when it was granted to William Briwere, and was shortly afterwards fixed as the prison of the stannaries and the meeting-place of the Forest Courts of Dartmoor. A gild at Lideford is mentioned in 1180, and the pipe roll of 1195 records a grant for the reestablishment of the market. In 1238 the borough, which had hitherto been crown demesne, was bestowed by Henry III on Richard of Cornwall, who in 1268 obtained a grant of a Wednesday market and a three days fair at the feast of St Petrock. The borough had a separate coroner and bailiff in 1275, but it was never incorporated by charter, and only once, in 1300, returned members to parliament.

During the English Civil War, Lydford was the haunt of the then notorious Gubbins band, a gang of ruthless cut-throats and highwaymen, who took advantage of the turmoil of the times to ply their villainry. According to one account of the time:
:&quot;Gubbins-land is a Scythia within England, and they pure heathens therein. Their language is the drosse of the dregs of the vulgar Devonian, They hold together like burrs: offend one and all will avenge their quarrel.&quot;

In 1987 the parish of Lydford finally lost its claim to be the largest parish in England. It was split into two civil parishes, Lydford and Dartmoor Forest. The ecclesiastical parish has also been split, with Princetown made a separate parish.

==Lydford Church==
The dedication of the parish church to St. Petrock would seem to indicate that it was built on the site of a pre-existing British settlement.

The current church was built in the perpendicular gothic style, and although ostensibly Norman, some of the architectural furniture, for example the font, is of the Anglo-Saxon style (or at latest, early Norman), thus it would appear that the church was rebuilt upon the site of the earlier building.

The church was enlarged in the 13th century and the tower added in the 15th century. In 1890 the vestry and northern aisle were added.

==Lydford Castle==
Two castles have been built at Lydford, the first immediately in the wake of the Norman Conquest in 1066.

The second castle was built on the site of the first castle in 1132. It was a 3-storey tower, commanding a strategic view over much of the surrounding countryside, and was eminently defensible, with the Gorge on one side, and the land sloping steeply away from it.

Its use changed under Edward I, who made the castle the Stannary prison; its reputation was not good. Sir Richard Grenville used the prison as an oubliette for his political opponents. An order of Parliament during the reign of Henry VIII describes the prison in 1512 as &quot;one of the most hanious, contagious and detestable places in the realm&quot;; Lydford Law was a by-word for injustice. It was also one of the seats of the Bloody Assizes of Hanging Judge Jeffreys.

The prison is commemorated in the poem &quot;Lydford Law&quot; by the Tavistock poet William Browne:
At the time of Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth, the castle was entirely in ruins, but in the 18th century it was restored and again used as a prison and as the meeting-place of the manor and borough courts. The site is now maintained by English Heritage, and entry is free of charge.

==Lydford&#x27;s toll road==
Lydford is located on the former stagecoach route between Tavistock and Okehampton. Now the A386, this was the Okehampton Turnpike Trust&#x27;s Tavistock Road. Near Beardon is a &#x27;Take-off&#x27; stone set in the verge. On steep hills heavily laden waggons or coaches could add an extra toll-free horse to help pull the vehicle up the hill, but this horse had to be taken off at the top. Very few of these stones still exist in situ.

==Twin towns==
Lydford is twinned with Petiville, France.

<doc id="625276" wikidata="Q902924" url="?curid=625276" title="Crested shelduck">
<text>The crested shelduck (Tadorna cristata), or Korean crested shelduck, is a species of bird in the family Anatidae. It is critically endangered. The male crested shelduck has a greenish-black crown, breast, primaries, and tail, while the rest of its face, chin, and throat are brownish black. The male&#x27;s belly, undertail coverts, and flanks are a dark grey with black striations. The upper wing coverts are white, while its speculum is an iridescent green. The female has a white eye ring, black crest, white face, chin, throat, neck, and uppers wing coverts and a dark brown body with white striations. Additionally, both sexes have a distinctive green tuft of feathers protruding from the head.

Very little is known about this species because of the limited number of observations of it. It apparently breeds in Korea and eastern Russia and is probably a relict species that had a wider distribution in prehistoric times. Some think that this species is extinct, although occasional sightings are reported, including a number of reports made between 1985 and 1991 from the interior wetlands of China. Due to the persistent reports of the species&#x27; survival, it is listed as critically endangered. However, the crested shelduck has not been definitively sighted since 1964.

== Taxonomy ==

The crested shelduck was initially collected in April 1877 near Vladivostok, Russia. However, it was not described until 1890 when the English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater decided that the specimen was a possible hybrid between the ruddy shelduck (&quot;Tadorna ferruginea&quot;) and falcated duck (&quot;Mareca falcata&quot;). Around 1913, a pair was collected in Korea, and the male was presented to Japanese ornithologist Nagamichi Kuroda. Kuroda noted that the plumage of the specimens was not definitively intermediate between Sclater&#x27;s suggested parents of the alleged hybrid. Another female was collected and given to Kuroda in 1916, and supported by three specimens of a bird which was clearly not a hybrid and a historical record of the species in Japan, Kuroda described this bird as &quot;Pseudotadorna cristata&quot; in 1917. The 1916 female was designated the holotype and preserved with the male in Kuroda&#x27;s collection. A member of the family Anatidae, this species was considered distinct enough to merit its own genus by Kuroda, but is now placed in the genus &quot;Tadorna&quot;, which includes six other species of Old World shelducks. The genus name &quot;Tadorna&quot; comes from the Celtic word &quot;tadorne&quot; and means &quot;pied waterfowl&quot;, essentially the same as the English &quot;shelduck&quot;. The specific epithet, &quot;cristata&quot;, comes from the Latin word for crested. The species&#x27; common name is derived from the tuft of green feathers from the shelduck&#x27;s head. This species is also known as the Korean crested shelduck, Korean sheldrake, and Korean Mandarin.

== Description ==
The crested shelduck is sexually dimorphic, with the male possessing a greenish-black crown, breast, primaries, and tail, while the rest of its face, chin, and throat are brownish black. The male&#x27;s belly, undertail coverts, and flanks are a dark grey with black striations. The upper wing coverlets are white, while its speculum is an iridescent green. The female has a large white eye ring, black crest, and white face, chin, throat, neck, and upper wing coverts. It also has a dark brown body with white striations. Both sexes have a green tuft of feathers protruding from their head. The crested shelduck is about long, and therefore is slightly larger than a mallard. Its bill and legs are pinkish, though those of the female are paler than those of the male. The bill of the male has a small, knob-like appendage at its base. The plumage of the immature is unknown.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The crested shelduck has been collected near Vladivostok in Russia and near Busan and Kunsan in Korea. It has been proposed that the species breeds in far-eastern Russia, northern North Korea, and northeast China and winters in southern Japan, southwest Korea, and along the east China coast as far south as Shanghai. It is believed to have a relict range, or to have been more widespread in historic times.

This species is believed to live in a wide variety of wetland and deep-water habitats at varying elevations. While all collected individuals are from the coast, especially near river mouths, recently there have been a number of reports from interior wetlands in northeastern China. It has been speculated that this species may breed in mountainous areas either away from water or on volcanic lakes.

== Ecology and behavior ==

Though not much is known about this shelduck, it is believed to be migratory, traveling from Siberia in the breeding season to Korea, southern Russia, and Japan for the winter. The crested shelduck is believed to eat aquatic vegetation, agricultural crops, algae, invertebrates, mollusks, crustaceans, carrion, and garbage. It has been suggested that this shelduck may be a nocturnal feeder. While its nest has not been described, similar shelducks nest in burrows and cavities; it has also been suggested that this species may nest in tree cavities. It has been proposed that this species lays less than ten eggs which the female alone incubates. It is believed to breed from May to July. The shelduck has been observed in flocks of two to eight birds.

== Conservation ==
The crested shelduck has never been numerous in modern times, though it is thought to have been more widespread historically due to its presence in Japanese aviculture. The species is known from only a handful of sightings and some retroactively declared it extinct in 1916 after a female was shot at Busan, South Korea. In 1943, a sighting of this bird was reported near Chungcheongbukdo, building hopes that the species persisted. A group of three birds, two females and a male, was sighted by two Russian students in 1964 in the Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago near Vladivostok with a small flock of harlequin ducks. In 1971 it was reported from North Korea&#x27;s northeast coast and in 1985 two were reported from eastern Russia. However, there are severe doubts about the accuracy of the 1971 record. A recent survey of Chinese hunters resulted in a number of unconfirmed reports from northeastern China. For example, a Chinese forest worker claimed that he unknowingly ate two in 1984. There are also unconfirmed reports of about twenty crested shelducks in the Dashanbao region of Yunnan, though many believe this flock to be a misidentified flock of ruddy shelducks. It is believed that, if the species survives, there likely are fewer than 50 individuals.

This species is threatened with extinction due to habitat loss, hunting, and overcollection. In an attempt to gather reports of this species and raise awareness to prevent hunters from consuming this species, 300,000 leaflets were distributed in Russia, Japan, China, South Korea, and North Korea in 1983, with the only resulting report being the 1971 North Korea record. 15,000 leaflets were distributed in northeastern China in 1985 and 1991. While this garnered 82 reports of the species, follow-up surveys of the area failed to find the shelduck. The Tumangan Development Project is threatening to destroy potential habitat in the area of several of the historic records.

This duck was collected in Korea and exported to Japan between 1716 and 1736 for aviculture, where it was known as the Korean Mandarin Duck. It was captured for aviculture in Japan up to at least 1854 and was portrayed in the &quot;Kanbun-Kinpu&quot;, a Japanese avicultural work. Old Chinese tapestries also portray a duck similar in appearance to the crested shelduck. Kuroda claimed that Japanese hunters were still hunting the species in Korea in the 1920s. Three specimens exist in museums. The only male specimen is kept with a female in the Kuroda collection in the Yamashina Institute for Ornithology, Tokyo. The male was collected at the mouth of the Geum River in 1913 or 1914, and the female was collected near Busan in December 1916. The female specimen described by Philip Lutley Sclater, collected by Lieutenant F. Irmininger near Vladivostok in April 1877, was displayed in 1894 by the Zoological Society of London and today is kept in the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen. Two additional crested shelduck specimens are known to have existed, though both have been lost. The female collected in 1913 along with the sole male was given to a friend of the collector and subsequently has vanished. Additionally, around 1900 a Chinese hunter offered a specimen to a Peking University professor, but, as the professor did not realize how rare the bird was, he turned it down. In 1991, the crested shelduck appeared on a Mongolian postage stamp.

<text>The Daily Worker was a newspaper published in Chicago founded by communists, socialists, union members, and other activists. Publication began in 1924. It generally reflected the prevailing views of members of the CPUSA; it also reflected a broader spectrum of left-wing opinion. At its peak, the newspaper achieved a circulation of 35,000. Contributors to its pages included Robert Minor and Fred Ellis (cartoonists), Lester Rodney (sports editor), David Karr, Richard Wright, John L. Spivak, Peter Fryer, Woody Guthrie, and Louis F. Budenz.

==History==

===Origins===
The origins of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; were with the weekly &quot;Ohio Socialist&quot; published by the Socialist Party of Ohio in Cleveland from 1917 to November 1919. The Ohio party joined the nascent Communist Labor Party of America (CLP) at the 1919 Emergency National Convention.

The &quot;Ohio Socialist&quot; only used whole numbers. Its final issue was #94 November 19, 1919. The &quot;Toiler&quot; continued this numbering, even though a typographical error made its debut issue #85 November 26, 1919. Beginning sometime in 1921 the volume number IV was added, perhaps reflecting the publications fourth year in print, though its issue numbers continued the whole number scheme. The final edition of the &quot;Toiler&quot; was Vol IV #207 January 28, 1922. The &quot;Worker&quot; continued the &quot;Toilers&quot; numbering during its run Vol. IV #208 February 2, 1922 to Vol. VI #310 January 12, 1924. The first edition of &quot;Daily worker&quot; was numbered Vol. I #311.

The &quot;Ohio Socialist&quot; became Toiler in November 1919. In 1920, with the CLP going underground, &quot;Toiler&quot; became the party&#x27;s &quot;aboveground&quot; newspaper published by &quot;The Toiler Publishing Association.&quot; It remained as the Cleveland aboveground publication of the CLP and its successors until February 1922.

In December 1921 the &quot;aboveground&quot; Workers Party of America was founded and the &quot;Toiler&quot; merged with &quot;Workers Council&quot; of the Workers&#x27; Council of the United States to found the six page weekly The Worker.

This became the &quot;Daily Worker&quot; beginning January 13, 1924.

In 1927, the newspaper moved from Chicago to New York.

===Popular front changes===
Beginning in the popular front period of the 1930s, the paper broadened its coverage of the arts and entertainment. In 1935, it established a sports page, with contributions from David Karr, the page was edited and frequently written by Lester Rodney. The paper&#x27;s sports coverage combined enthusiasm for baseball with the usual Marxist social critique of capitalist society and bourgeois attitudes. It advocated the desegregation of professional sports. 

===Post-World War II===
After a short hiatus, the party published a weekend paper called &quot;The Worker&quot; from 1958 until 1968. A Tuesday edition called &quot;The Midweek Worker&quot; was added in 1961 and also continued until 1968, when production was accelerated. 

===Two newspapers and a merger===
In 1968, the publication was resumed as a New York daily paper, now titled &quot;The Daily World&quot;. In 1986, the paper merged with the West Coast weekly paper, the &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot;. The new &quot;People&#x27;s Daily World&quot; published from 1987 until 1991, when daily publication was abandoned.

=== Contemporary claims of successors ===
The new paper was cut back to a weekly issue and was retitled &quot;People&#x27;s Weekly World&quot; (later retitled to &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; as to de-emphasize the weekly component). Print publication of the &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; ceased in 2010 in favor of an online edition. , &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; claims that, &quot;Peoplesworld.org is a daily news website of, for and by the 99% and the direct descendant of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;.&quot; Its publisher is Long View Publishing Company. The online newspaper is a member of the International Labor Communications Association and is indexed in the Alternative Press Index. Its staff belong to the Newspaper Guild/CWA, AFL–CIO. 

Another publication, both in print as &quot;The Worker&quot; and online as &quot;Daily Worker USA&quot; states that it is &quot;Continuing &quot;The Daily Worker&quot;, Founded in 1924.&quot; &quot;The Worker&quot; is the Publication of the Central Committee of the Party of Communists USA, which itself claims to be the continuing the legacy of the old CPUSA, and The Worker has been printed and distributed since at least 2020.

<text>Kevin Lars Constantine (born December 27, 1958) is an American ice hockey coach who previously served as the head coach of the Wenatchee Wild of the Western Hockey League (WHL). The Wenatchee Wild’s first coach in franchise history was suspended on Sept. 24, 2023, after the league received a complaint regarding his conduct and began an investigation. Constantine has coached hockey teams in the NHL, WHL, IHL, AHL and numerous major junior hockey leagues. He was also the former head coach of HC Ambri-Piotta in the Swiss National League A. He also coached the North Iowa Huskies for a brief time. From 2022 to 2023, he was the head coach of the Hungarian national ice hockey team. He left that position despite having a valid contract in summer of 2023.

==Playing career==
Born in International Falls, Minnesota, Constantine was drafted as goaltender by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1978 NHL Draft, and played 34 games of collegiate hockey for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York from 1977 to 1980. He left RPI as a junior and finished his degree at the University of Nevada, Reno.

==Coaching career==
Constantine made a name for himself as a head coach in the late 1980s and early 1990s by guiding the Rochester Mustangs of the USHL and the Kansas City Blades of the IHL to winning records, as well as coaching the 1991 U.S. National Junior team to its (then) best-ever record at the World Junior Championships. Having found success at lower levels, he was hired as head coach of the San Jose Sharks for the 1993–1994 season: under his guidance, the team set an NHL record for largest improvement by finishing 58 points higher in the standings than it had the previous season. Between 1993 and 2002, Constantine would coach the Sharks, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the New Jersey Devils, earning a record of 161-150-61-5. He is the only coach in NHL history to take two eighth-seeded teams to first-round Stanley Cup playoff upsets (San Jose over the Detroit Red Wings in 1994 and Pittsburgh over New Jersey in 1999).

In 2001, he founded the Pittsburgh Forge, a new entry in the NAHL. In two seasons as the team&#x27;s general manager and co-coach, Constantine amassed a record of 80–24–8 – the Forge won the NAHL regular season championship in 2002. After the 2002–2003 season, Constantine left Pittsburgh to be hired by the WHL expansion team, the Everett Silvertips, while the Forge relocated to eventually become the present-day Corpus Christi IceRays. In their first year, the Silvertips broke the record for best season ever by a first-year team in the major junior hockey leagues (the WHL, OHL and QMJHL), winning the U.S. Division Championship—they continued to set records, winning three straight playoff rounds to claim the Western Conference Championship and advance to the WHL Final against the Medicine Hat Tigers, where they lost 4–0.

In 2006, Constantine was fined $5,000 and suspended for four games by the WHL after an incident in which he made the Silvertips eat their post-game meal and ride the bus home in their equipment after losing an exhibition match to the Tri-City Americans 5-0.

On May 29, 2007, Constantine was named the head coach of the AHL&#x27;s Houston Aeros. He quickly turned the performance of the Aeros around, leading them into the playoffs the next two seasons, including a trip to the Western Conference finals in 2009. On April 15, 2010, it was announced that Constantine&#x27;s contract would not be renewed for the 2010–2011 season, after the Aeros again failed to make the playoffs for various reasons.

He accepted the head coaching job at Ducs d’Angers in France for the 2010-11 season. Two months into the job, Constantine left the club to take over HC Ambrì-Piotta of the Swiss top-flight National League A (NLA). He was removed from his head coaching position in October 2012, but stayed on as the club’s consultant.

On June 13, 2013, Constantine was introduced once again as the head coach of the Everett Silvertips, where he is reunited with the second Silvertips captain, Mitch Love, now an assistant coach.

On June 19, 2017 it was announced that Constantine has been hired as the head coach of the Incheon, South Korean hockey club Daemyung Killer Whales, one of eight teams in the Asia League Ice Hockey (ALIH) which comprises teams from South Korea, Japan and Russia. On November 20, 2020, he was announced the head coach of the Polish team Unia Oświęcim.

On July 13, 2023, the Wenatchee Wild announced Constantine as the team&#x27;s first WHL head coach following the sale, relocation, and renaming of the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Winnipeg Ice to Wenatchee following the 2022-2023 season. In September 2023, the WHL suspended Constantine indefinitely pending an independent investigation into his conduct with the team. On October 4, 2023, the WHL announced that he had been suspended indefinitely after an independent investigation determined he violated Western Hockey League regulations and policies by making derogatory comments of a discriminatory nature. The earliest he could apply to be reinstated is 2025.

==NHL coaching record==

==Awards==
Constantine has been the recipient of USA Hockey&#x27;s Distinguished Achievement Award: USA Hockey is the governing body for amateur ice hockey in the United States, and the award recognizes a U.S. citizen who has made a major contribution to hockey in the United States.

He was a finalist for the 1994 Jack Adams Award for top NHL coach.
He won the 1991–1992 Commissioner&#x27;s Trophy.

Constantine also was awarded the Coach of the Year award by the WHL in 2004.

<text>In Abrahamic religions, forbidden fruit is a name given to the fruit growing in the Garden of Eden which God commands mankind not to eat. In the biblical story, Adam and Eve eat the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and are exiled from Eden:

As a metaphor outside of the Abrahamic religions, the phrase typically refers to any indulgence or pleasure that is considered illegal or immoral.

==Biblical story==

The story of the Book of Genesis places the first man and woman, Adam and Eve, in the Garden of Eden, where they may eat the fruit of many trees, but are forbidden by God to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

In Genesis 3, a serpent tempts the woman:
Desiring this knowledge, the woman eats the forbidden fruit and gives some to the man, who also eats it. They become aware of their nakedness and make fig-leaf clothes, and hide themselves when God approaches. When confronted, Adam tells God that Eve gave him the fruit to eat, and Eve tells God that the serpent deceived her into eating it. God then curses the serpent, the woman, and the man, and expels the man and woman from the Garden before they eat of the tree of eternal life.

==Quranic story==

According to the Quran, Surah Al-A&#x27;raf 7:19 describes Adam and his wife in Paradise where they may eat what is provided, except for one Tree they must not eat from, lest they be considered (; &#x27;wrongdoers&#x27;).

Surah Al-A&#x27;raf 7:20–22 describes  (), who whispers to Adam and his wife and deceives them. When they tasted of the tree, their nakedness was exposed to them, prompting them to cover themselves with leaves from Paradise.

==Gnostic story==
A Gnostic interpretation of the story proposes that it was the archons who created Adam and attempted to prevent him from eating the forbidden fruit in order to keep him in a state of ignorance, after the spiritual form of Eve entered the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil while leaving a physical version of herself with Adam once she awakened him. However, the forces of the heavenly realm (Pleroma) sent the serpent as a representative of the divine sphere to reveal to Adam and Eve the evil intentions of their creators. The serpent succeeded in convincing them to eat the fruit and become like gods, capable of distinguishing between good and evil.

==Identifications and depictions==
The word &quot;fruit&quot; appears in Hebrew as . As to which fruit may have been the forbidden fruit of the Garden of Eden, possibilities include an apple, grapes, a pomegranate, a fig, carob, etrog or citron, pear, quince, wheat, banana, coco de mer, and mushrooms. The pseudepigraphic Book of Enoch describes the tree of knowledge: &quot;It was like a species of the Tamarind tree, bearing fruit which resembled grapes extremely fine; and its fragrance extended to a considerable distance. I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!&quot; (1 Enoch 31:4).

In Islamic tradition, the fruit is commonly either identified with wheat or with grapevine.

===Apple===

In Western Europe, the fruit is often depicted as an apple. This is frequently explained as resulting from a misunderstanding of – or a pun on – two unrelated words , a native Latin noun which means &#x27;evil&#x27; (from the adjective ), and , another Latin noun, borrowed from Greek , which means &#x27;apple&#x27;. In the Vulgate, Genesis 2:17 describes the tree as : &quot;but of the tree [literally &#x27;wood&#x27;] of knowledge of good and evil&quot; ( here is the genitive of ). However, Yadin-Israel argues that Latin Christian writers from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages rarely used to refer to the forbidden fruit.

Azzan Yadin-Israel argues that the identification of the forbidden fruit with an apple first appears in medieval French art of the 12th century. According to Yadin-Israel, Latin authors frequently referred to the forbidden fruit as , a Latin word meaning &quot;fruit&quot;. From this term derived the Old French word &quot;pom&quot; (modern French &quot;pomme&quot;), which originally also meant &quot;fruit&quot;, but in later times the word took on the narrower meaning of &quot;apple&quot;, leading medieval artists to represent the fruit as an apple.

Nothing in the Bible indicates that the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge was an apple.

The larynx, specifically the laryngeal prominence that joins the thyroid cartilage, in the human throat is noticeably more prominent in males and was consequently called an Adam&#x27;s apple, from a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit getting stuck in Adam&#x27;s throat as he swallowed it.

===Grape===
Rabbi Meir says that the fruit was a grape, made into wine. The Zohar explains similarly that Noah attempted (but failed) to rectify the sin of Adam by using grape wine for holy purposes. The midrash of Bereishit Rabah states that the fruit was grape, or squeezed grapes (perhaps alluding to wine). Chapter 4 of 3 Baruch, also known as the Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, designates the fruit as the grape. 3 Baruch is a first to third century text that is either Christian or Jewish with Christian interpolations.

===Fig===

The Bible states in the book of Genesis that Adam and Eve had made their own fig leaf clothing: &quot;And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles&quot;. Rabbi Nehemiah Hayyun supports the idea that the fruit was a fig, as it was from fig leaves that Adam and Eve made garments for themselves after eating the fruit. &quot;By that with which they were made low were they rectified.&quot; Since the fig is a long-standing symbol of female sexuality, it enjoyed a run as a favorite understudy to the apple as the forbidden fruit during the Italian Renaissance, Michelangelo Buonarroti depicting it as such in his fresco on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

===Pomegranate===
Proponents of the theory that the Garden of Eden was located somewhere in what is now known as the Middle East suggest that the fruit was actually a pomegranate, as it is one of the earliest domesticated plants on the Eastern Mediterranean. The association of the pomegranate with knowledge of the underworld as provided in the Ancient Greek legend of Persephone may also have given rise to an association with knowledge of the otherworld, tying-in with knowledge that is forbidden to mortals. It is also believed Hades offered Persephone a pomegranate to force her to stay with him in the underworld. Hades is the Greek god of the underworld and the Bible states that whoever eats the forbidden fruit shall die.

===Wheat===
Rabbi Yehuda proposes that the fruit was wheat, because &quot;a baby does not know to call its mother and father until it tastes the taste of grain.&quot;

In Hebrew, wheat is , which has been considered to be a pun on , meaning &quot;sin&quot;.

Although commonly confused with a seed, in the study of botany a wheat berry is technically a simple fruit known as a caryopsis, which has the same structure as an apple. Just as an apple is a fleshy fruit that contains seeds, a grain is a dry fruit that absorbs water and contains a seed. The confusion comes from the fact that the fruit of a grass happens to have a form similar to some seeds.

===Mushroom===

A fresco in the 13th-century Plaincourault Abbey in France depicts Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, flanking a Tree of Knowledge that has the appearance of a gigantic &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot;, a psychoactive mushroom.

Terence McKenna proposed that the forbidden fruit was a reference to psychotropic plants and fungi, specifically psilocybin mushrooms, which he theorized played a central role in the evolution of the human brain. Earlier, in a well-documented but heavily criticized study, John M. Allegro proposed the mushroom as the forbidden fruit.

===Banana===
Several proponents of the theory that the forbidden fruit was a banana exist dating from the 13th century.

In Nathan HaMe&#x27;ati&#x27;s 13th-century translation of Maimonides&#x27;s work &quot;The Medical Aphorisms of Moses&quot;, the banana is called the &quot;apple of Eden&quot;. In the 16th century, Menahem Lonzano considered it common knowledge in Syria and Egypt that the banana was the apple of Eden.

===Coco de mer===
Charles George Gordon identified the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge with the coco de mer.

==Parallel concepts==
Alcohol in the Bible explores the dual role of alcohol, highlighting its positive uses and warnings against excess. In biblical narratives, the fermentation of fruit into wine holds significance, with grapes and wine often linked to both celebration and cautionary tales of sin and temptation, reminiscent of the concept of the forbidden fruit.

===Greek mythology===
The similarities of the story to the story of Pandora&#x27;s box were identified by early Christians such as Tertullian, Origen, and Gregory of Nazianzus.

<text>3568 ASCII, provisional designation , is a dark background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 17 October 1936, by French astronomer Marguerite Laugier at the Nice Observatory in southwestern France. In 1988, the D-type asteroid was named after both the computer character code ASCII and the Japanese computer magazine with the same name.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;ASCII&quot; is a non-family asteroid from the main belt&#x27;s background population. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.4–3.9 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,044 days; semi-major axis of 3.15 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its observation as at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in November 1975, or more than 39 years after its official discovery observation at Nice.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;ASCII&quot; has an absolute magnitude of 11.8. Based on the Moving Object Catalog (MOC) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the body has a spectral type of a very dark D-type asteroid, typically found in the outer main-belt and numerous among the Jupiter trojans. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of this asteroid has been obtained from photometric observations. The body&#x27;s rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;ASCII&quot; measures 23.752 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.045.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the acronym for &quot;American Standard Code for Information Interchange&quot;, ASCII, a computer character code and the name of a major Japanese magazine on microcomputers. The name was proposed by Syuichi Nakano, who identified this asteroid during his stay at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory; a stay which was partially funded by articles he wrote for the principal Japanese ASCII magazine. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 April 1988 ().

<text>Bears &amp; Eagles Riverfront Stadium, originally simply Riverfront Stadium, was a 6,200-seat baseball park in Newark, New Jersey built in 1999. It was the home field of the Newark Bears, who played in the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent minor baseball league. The Bears played in the stadium from 1999 until 2013 when they announced a move to the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball, but the team was folded shortly thereafter.

The stadium was also home to the baseball teams of two of Newark&#x27;s universities: the Rutgers-Newark Scarlet Raiders, who play in the New Jersey Athletic Conference as part of NCAA Division III, and the NJIT Highlanders, who play in the America East Conference as part of NCAA Division I.

The stadium was named in honor of the original Bears, who were the top farm club of the New York Yankees from 1946 until 1949, and the Newark Eagles, who played in the Negro leagues. Above the press boxes, the stadium featured a Hall of Fame bearing the names of famed players from the Bears and the Eagles and baseball players from Newark.

The stadium cost $34 million to build. It was sold to a developer in 2016 for $23 million, and the site was designated for a commercial-residential project named Riverfront Square. The stadium was demolished in 2019.

==History==
The Newark Bears had joined the Atlantic League at its founding in 1998 but played their &#x27;home&#x27; games at The Ballpark at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport, Connecticut during that first season, sharing the park with the Bridgeport Bluefish. Since the construction of the stadium was still not finished in 1999, the Bears played their first 20 home games at Skylands Park in Augusta, New Jersey, sharing the facility with the New Jersey Cardinals. The stadium hosted its first baseball game on July 16, 1999, when the Bears took on the Lehigh Valley Black Diamonds. 

The Bears nicknamed the stadium &quot;Brick City&quot; or &quot;The Den&quot;.

Originally, the stadium was to be built along the Passaic River, perhaps at or near Riverbank Park, but the eventual site was at Broad and Orange Streets. The block of Orange Street, between Broad Street and McCarter Highway, was vacated to allow for the ballpark to be built.

In 2001, the Bears added &quot;Bears &amp; Eagles&quot; to the name of the park. The new name reflected the heritage represented by both the International League&#x27;s Bears, and the Negro National League Newark Eagles, both of whom had played at Ruppert Stadium (demolished in 1967) in the area now called the Ironbound.

In 2019, the stadium was demolished to make way for a new development called Riverfront Square. The developers of the project, Lotus, selected Practice for Architecture and Urbanism (PAU), led by Vishaan Chakrabarti, to develop the master plan and oversee part of the architectural design for the project.

==Public transportation ==
The stadium was across the street from New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Broad Street Station. Opened July 17, 2006, the Riverfront Stadium station on the Newark Light Rail provides service from Newark Penn Station.

<doc id="625316" wikidata="Q1088751" url="?curid=625316" title="Chrysler New Yorker">
<text>The Chrysler New Yorker is an automobile model produced by Chrysler from 1940 until 1996, serving for several decades as either the brand&#x27;s flagship model or as a junior sedan to the Chrysler Imperial, the latter during the years in which the Imperial name was used within the Chrysler lineup rather than as a standalone brand.

A trim level named the &quot;New York Special&quot; first appeared in 1938, while the &quot;New Yorker&quot; name debuted in 1939. The New Yorker helped define the Chrysler brand as a maker of upscale models that were priced and equipped to compete against upper-level models from Buick, Oldsmobile, and Mercury.

The New Yorker was Chrysler&#x27;s most prestigious model throughout most of its run. Over the decades, it was available in several body styles, including sedan, coupe, convertible, and wagon.

Until its discontinuation in 1996, the New Yorker was the longest-running American car nameplate.
&#x27;

==1938–1942==
The New York Special Series C19 was introduced as a distinct sub-series of the 1938 Chrysler Imperial. It was available as a four-door sedan with a straight-eight engine and a generous amount of comfort and space for the passengers, and a two-door Business Coupe - though no records show one was ordered and built. Unique broadcloth upholstery was specific to the New York Special, offering two single-color exterior paint or four two-tone color combinations. Instrument panels were highly polished woodgrain finish and were harmonized with the upholstery colors. For 1939 it was expanded with two more coupe versions and a two-door sedan and a larger, more powerful engine from Imperial, and it took on the &quot;New Yorker&quot; name, dropping the &quot;Special&quot; tag. Prices ranged from US$1,223 ($ in dollars ) for the two-passenger two-door coupe to US$1,298 ($ in dollars ) for the four-door sedan.

The first convertibles were introduced with the all-new body design of the 1940 models. This, the C26 series, was the first New Yorker to be considered a standalone model rather than as an Imperial version. It also saw the introduction of Fluid Drive, a fluid coupling between the engine and the clutch. It featured an independent front coil suspension and a beam axle in the rear. The only transmission available was the basic three-speed manual. The &quot;New Yorker Highlander&quot;, included tartan seats and other interior elements, and the same interior treatment was on the Windsor Highlander, but an I6 engine powered it. Interior color choices were blue, green, brown, and maroon for the cloth upholstery while the headliner, interior rear quarter panels, and door panels were trimmed in a lighter, contrasting shade of upholstery color.

Lightly redesigned bodies were introduced for 1941, with the business coupe now being a three-window design. The bodies were all marginally wider and lower, with increased glass surfaces. Another new model was the Town Sedan with the rear doors hinged at the forward edge of the doors. This year, the Vacamatic was made available. However, unlike the version sold on six-cylinder models, the Saratoga/New Yorker version was a three-speed transmission with overdrive called &quot;Cruise and Climb&quot;.

With America entering World War II on 11 December 1941, all automobile production ended at the beginning of February 1942. Thus, the 1942 model year was roughly half the usual length. Cars built after December 1941 had blackout trim. The 1942 Chryslers were relatively modern, with a design that heralded the post-war ponton style with fenders more incorporated into the bodywork. The grille consisted of five horizontal chrome bars wrapped around the front, reaching to the leading edge of the front wheelwel A total of 12,145 New Yorkers of the C36 series were built this year. Chrysler would produce and experiment with engines for tanks and aircraft during World War II.


==1946–1948==
When production resumed after World War II in 1946, the New Yorker became Chrysler&#x27;s top luxury trim package, while the Imperial Crown offered New Yorker levels of luxury with an extended wheelbase. Unlike most car companies, Chrysler did not make significant changes with each model year from 1946 through 1948. Thus, from 1946 through 1948, Chryslers had the same basic appearance, characterized by their die-cast &#x27;harmonica&#x27; grille and based on the body introduced with the 1941 models. 1947 saw a minor redesign in tires, trim, and instrument panel, while the first 1948s were just 1947s with no visible changes. Postwar Chryslers continued to offer Fluid Drive, with the New Yorker now offering the Presto-Matic four-speed semi-automatic transmission.

Chrysler offered the New Yorker as the luxury car to compete with the Cadillac Series 61, Buick Roadmaster, and Packard Super Clipper listing the four-door sedan at US$2,073 ($ in dollars ) before optional equipment. The Chrysler Saratoga featured the larger eight-cylinder engine but with a lower trim level and interior features. Six-cylinder engines with higher grade interior and appearance were offered as Chrysler Royal short wheelbase or the longer wheelbase Chrysler Windsor . The Chrysler Town and Country models included exterior wood body panels with luxurious appearance until the line became exclusively as a station wagon.

The two-door sedan was available in three variations, and the body styles were shared with DeSoto, Dodge, and Plymouth branded models. The styles were a three-passenger Coupe, a six-passenger Club Coupe with a sloping rear roof, and a six-passenger brougham sedan with a formal rear roof appearance.

==1949–1954==
The 1949 model year New Yorker used Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s new postwar body with ponton three-box styling, which was shared with Dodge and DeSoto. The engine remained the straight eight coupled to Fluid Drive and the Presto-Matic four-speed semi-automatic. Body styles were reduced to club coupe, four-door sedan, and convertible. The wheelbase on the New Yorker was increased to from the frame introduced in 1941. The previous design had been carried through early 1949, with the new (C46) series having been delayed due to a strike in late 1948. A padded dashboard was optional.

A new body style was introduced for 1950, a two-door hardtop, called the Newport and the Special Club coupe. Further upgrades included foam rubber padding on the dashboard for safety. The New Yorker was the more deluxe of the regular eight-cylinder Chryslers. At the same time, the Saratoga was repositioned as lower in the hierarchy, offering the straight eight with plainer trim with cloth upholstery available in several colors, the Spitfire straight-eight engine, and a roomy interior featuring &quot;chair height&quot; seats. The &quot;Presto-Matic&quot; fluid drive transmission had two forward ranges, each with two speeds. In everyday driving, the high range was engaged using the clutch. The car could then be driven without using the clutch (unless reverse or low range was required); at any speed above , the driver released the accelerator, and the transmission shifted into the higher gear of the range with a slight &quot;clunk&quot;. When the car came to a stop, the lower gear was again engaged.

Chrysler introduced the FirePower Hemi V8 for 1951. The FirePower Hemi equipped cars could accelerate 0 to in 10 seconds, faster than the Oldsmobile 88 Rocket engine of that time. This engine became popular among hot rodders and racers.

The New Yorker also offered Fluid Torque Drive, with an actual torque converter, instead of the Fluid Drive units. Cars with Fluid Torque Drive came only with Fluid Matic semi-automatic transmission and had a gear selector quadrant on the steering column. Hydraguide power steering, an industry first, appeared as an option on Chrysler cars with the Hemi engine.

A station wagon was available for 1951, with only 251 built. Its wheelbase is the longest ever used on a station wagon.

The 1952 model year included a minor redesign of taillights with backup lights in the lower section. This was also the final year for the wheelbase chassis for the New Yorker.

Harold A. Clark used a New Yorker as the base for a full-size sports car called the &quot;Clark Cyclonic&quot;. The price was approximately $15,000 ($ in dollars ), and Clark planned to produce 48 during the first year. Whether this car ever reached production is not known.

The 1953 model year New Yorker had a less bulky look with the wheelbase reduced to , a one-piece curved windshield, rear fenders integrated into the body, and pull-style exterior door handles. Wire wheels were now an option. The Saratoga line was discontinued for 1953, and replaced by the New Yorker. The previous New Yorker model positioning was redesignated as the New Yorker DeLuxe. The convertible and Newport hardtop were available only in the New Yorker DeLuxe line while the base New Yorker offered a long-wheelbase sedan and a Town &amp; Country wagon. The convertible was New Yorker&#x27;s most expensive model on the chassis for 1953, with 950 built.

The six cylinder was replaced in 1954 with the popular FirePower V8; a DeLuxe option was rated at . Although introduced very late in the 1953 model year, all 1954 New Yorkers were available with the new two-speed Powerflite automatic transmission. Fluid Torque Drive and Fluid Matic were dropped. 1954 was the last year the long-wheelbase sedan was offered by Chrysler.

==1955–1956==
For the 1955 model year, Chrysler introduced new designs that borrowed styling cues from Virgil Exner&#x27;s custom 1952 Imperial Parade Phaeton. These replaced the out-of-fashion high roofline designs of K.T. Keller. Additionally, the Imperial luxury brand was reintroduced. A new four-door hardtop body style became available. The tradition of adding the Newport as a suffix to the model name continued, while the &quot;St. Regis&quot; nameplate was used for hardtops with exclusive two-tone paint. The Hemi V8&#x27;s output was up to , another step forward in Detroit&#x27;s ongoing horsepower war, while the Chrysler 300 offered higher amounts of horsepower from the same displacement engine. The PowerFlite transmission added a control lever on the instrument panel for 1955.

All New Yorkers for 1955 were now given the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; suffix, and the Imperial Newport two-door hardtop replaced the Club Coupe. The new, higher-priced St. Regis two-door hardtop filled the position of the former Chrysler Windsor. The sedan, convertible, and Town &amp; Country wagon were offered.

Chrysler described the 1956 model year&#x27;s design &quot;PowerStyle,&quot; a product of Chrysler designer Virgil Exner. The New Yorker gained a new mesh grille, leather seats, pushbutton TorqueFlite selector, and a 354 cubic inch Hemi V8 with . A four-door pillarless hardtop made its debut, and the &quot;DeLuxe&quot; nameplate was dropped from the New Yorker for 1956.

Chrysler introduced an under-dash mounted 16 2/3 rpm record player, dubbed the &quot;Highway Hi-Fi&quot;, that was manufactured by CBS Electronics. A two-way switch in the dash changed the input for the speaker from the all-transistor radio to the 7-inch record player. The St. Regis two-door hardtop was available with a choice of nine optional three-tone paint schemes, and the Town and Country Wagon model was Chrysler&#x27;s most expensive vehicle labeled as a Chrysler for 1956, listed at $4,523. Only 921 convertibles were made.

==1957–1959==
The 1957 model year Chrysler cars were redesigned with Virgil Exner&#x27;s &quot;Forward Look&quot; at the cost of $300 million when Chrysler took on a loan in 1954 from Prudential Insurance to pay for expansion and updated car designs. The New Yorker sported fins that swept up from just behind the front doors. Its Hemi V8 was increased to and . The TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission and a Torsion-Aire torsion bar front suspension were standard.

Early model year production had single headlamps with quad headlamps optional where state regulations permitted them. The single headlamps were dropped later in the year. A total of 10,948 New Yorkers were built, 1,049 of them convertibles.

The 1958 New Yorker received new body-side trim and smaller taillights. The Hemi output was up again, to . &quot;Auto-Pilot&quot; cruise control was introduced. Sales decreased due to the recession of 1958. The convertible model was still available, with only 666 made. The reputation of Chrysler cars became tainted because of rust problems caused by rushed production and testing.

The FirePower Hemi V8 was replaced in 1959 New Yorkers by a new, less expensive to produce wedge head Golden Lion V8. Tailfins and the front end were altered. With the departure of the Hemi the New Yorker line was repositioned as a luxury car with styling similar to the Imperial of 1958.

==1960–1964==
The 1960 model year New Yorkers used unibody construction, and the carry-over RB engine had an output of . Starting with 1960, all Chrysler models adopted the grille appearance from the Chrysler 300F. The rear bucket seats from the 300 models 300 were optional on the New Yorker Custom coupe.

The New Yorker 1961 model year featured a new grille, slanted headlights, and a continental kit appearance on the trunk lid. The 413 CID &quot;RB&quot; Golden Lion V8 continued. This was the last of the &quot;Forward Look&quot; models. Chrysler built 2,541 New Yorker two-door hardtops, in Canada through 1964 and 1965 in the U.S., and no longer used the nameplate &quot;Newport&quot; for hardtop models when the Chrysler Newport became its model line.

The program to create all-new Chryslers for the 1962 model year was abruptly canceled in 1960. The alternative, as detailed by Chrysler designer Jeffrey I. Godshall, was instead to take the Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s full-sized 1961 models and literally &quot;mix-and-match&quot; them to create the 1962 Chryslers. The 1962 model year New Yorkers would only be offered as four-door models. Thus, both the 1962 hardtop sedan and the pillared sedan were made by taking the front end of a 1961 New Yorker (updated for 1962) and mating it to the de-finned body of a corresponding 1961 Dodge Polara four-door sedan. The Polara, which was Dodge&#x27;s only long-wheelbase model, was chosen because its body&#x27;s smoother sides proved to be easier to work with when creating a finless body, a significant requirement for the redesign. The 1961 Polara&#x27;s existing tailfins and taillights were replaced by redesigned rear-quarter panels, which furnished the 1962 New Yorkers with finless rear fenders and new taillights. Similarly, the 1962 New Yorker station wagon was made by mating an updated front end of a 1961 New Yorker to the body of a 1961 Plymouth Suburban four-door station wagon. A Plymouth station wagon was Plymouth&#x27;s only long-wheelbase offering, and it was chosen because it was Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s only finless full-sized station wagon. Thus, only four-door New Yorkers were offered in wagon, sedan, and hardtop body styles.

The 1962 New Yorker was the last Chrysler to have a wheelbase.

The dash had been designed with Chrysler&#x27;s push-button controls for the TorqueFlite automatic in mind, with the &quot;AstraDome&quot; instrument cluster covering the part of the steering column a column shifter would come out from under then-standard practice, so manual cars used a floor shifter. Due to the installation of the &quot;AstraDome&quot; instrument cluster extending outward towards the steering wheel, the traditional installation of the turn signal lever was relocated to the dashboard underneath the &quot;TorqueFlite&quot; push-button gear selectors and was installed as a sliding lever that would return to center as the steering wheel returned to the center position.

The 413 RB had a 4.1875 in (106 mm) bore and was used from 1959 until 1965. It powered all Chrysler New Yorker, 300G &amp; 300H, and Imperial Custom, Crown, and Le Baron models during that period. It was also available on the Chrysler Newport, Dodge&#x27;s Polara and Monaco, and the Plymouth Fury as an alternative to the 383-cubic-inch B series engine or the 318 Poly. With a compression ratio of 10:1, it developed and of torque with a four-barrel carburetor.

===1963–1964===
The 1963 model year New Yorker used Chrysler&#x27;s wholly redesigned body with only the windshield showing traces of the previous Forward Look designs. However, platform changes were minimal, with just a switch from 12-inch &quot;Total Contact&quot; to Bendix-made 11-inch Duo-Servo brakes. 

A new, more luxurious Salon four-door hardtop was added at midyear as a trim package in the U.. Engine output was and the wheelbase was .

Chrysler sales increased 1963 due to introducing a five-year/50,000-mile warranty, a business practice unmatched by the competitors in the 1960s. 

Changes for the 1964 model year included a new grille, a larger rear window, and small tailfins giving the car a boxier look from the side. Canadians were given the choice of a new two-door hardtop, while Americans continued with the Salon option for the four-door pillarless hardtop. A convertible body style was no longer offered.

==1965–1968==
All 1965 model-year Chryslers (as well as full-sized Plymouth and Dodge models) were built on an all-new C-body unibody platform that featured a bolt-on, rubber-isolated front subframe. Elwood Engel designed the 1965 New Yorker (and all Chrysler models) with styling cues from his 1961 Lincoln Continental — slab sides with chrome trim along the top edges of the fenders. The styling began to share some visual similarities with Chrysler Motors&#x27; premium luxury sedan, the Imperial, which received an all-new appearance in 1964.

The standard engine was a Firepower  V8, with a single four-barrel carburetion. Optional was the 413 from that year&#x27;s Chrysler letter cars, which came with an unsilenced air cleaner, dual breaker ignition, special camshaft, and dual exhaust. The three-speed &quot;TorqueFlite&quot; automatic transmission was standard. 1965 was the last year for the 413, replaced in 1966 by the new 440.

The 1965 New Yorker was offered as a four-door sedan, two- and four-door hardtop, and as a Town &amp; Country in two- or three-row station wagon. The four-door sedan was a six-window Town Sedan, also available in the Newport line and Dodge Custom 880 4-door Sedan. A four-door, four-window sedan was produced, but not offered in the New Yorker line. The two-door hardtop was marketed in the United States. While the 300 and Newport two-door hardtops shared a rounded, convertible-styled roof, the New Yorker had a unique roofline resembling the four-door hardtops. A padded vinyl covering on the parallelogram-shaped rear pillar highlighted the more formal and squared-off lines. The wheelbase of the New Yorker models, except the wagon, was . The Town &amp; Country wagon was on the Dodge&#x27;s wheelbase as all C-body wagons shared the same basic body. Factory options for 1965 included a vinyl rear roof pillar insert, Saginaw-sourced Tilt &#x27;N Telescopic steering wheel, air conditioning, and power options (windows, antenna, and steering).

The 1965 Chrysler sales increased nearly 40% compared to 1963, to 204,002. Of those 49,871, were New Yorkers, a 62% increase over 1964.

Styling for the 1966 model year was an evolution of the 1965 themes. Changes included a new grille, tail lamps, and revised side trim. The biggest news was the adoption of the new Firepower 440 V8 engine. In standard form, it produced ; the optional, high-performance &quot;440 TNT&quot; included a twin snorkel, silenced air cleaner, and dual exhausts. The New Yorker line-up no longer offered a station wagon body style for 1966, as the Town &amp; Country wagon was now marketed as a series on its own. The four-door, six-window Town Sedan and two- and four-door hardtop body styles were continued.

Although 1966 was another good sales year for the Chrysler division overall, with a nearly 29% increase in production and sales of 262,495, New Yorker numbers were down to 47,579.

Chrysler completely redesigned sheet metal below the beltline for the 1967 model year. New styling features were wraparound parking lights at the front and taillights at the rear. A new &quot;fasttop&quot; design for the two-door hardtop replaced the more formal look of the 1965 and 1966 designs. The four-door sedan reverted to the four-window style as used on the Newport line.

Sales fell 20%, the company&#x27;s lowest in five years, due to an economic slump that year.

Styling changes for 1968 included a new grille, bumpers, front sheet metal, rear fenders, and rear deck. Although the Newport and 300 four-door hardtops received a new, sportier roofline shared with Dodge and Plymouth, the New Yorker continued with the roofline introduced in 1965. The main exterior features distinguishing the New Yorker from the other Chrysler lines were a full-width grille with a rectangular pattern, repeated at the rear by the full-width deck trim, and continuous lower bodyside molding.

Chrysler production rebounded with the year setting a record at 264,863 cars built, Of these, 48,143 were New Yorkers, a slight improvement over the 1966 level.

==1969–1973==
The August 1968 introduction of the 1969 model year full-size Chryslers unveiled an all-new &quot;Fuselage Styling&quot; that shared with all C-body cars, including the completely restyled Imperial. Although the previous generation&#x27;s platform continued, the &quot;fuselage&quot; styling was a major reworking. It featured plain curved smooth sides with a higher beltline. Distinguishing the full-size cars were details at the front and rear that had rectangular-frame bumpers as well as different taillamps. However, the high beltline and fenders provided a bulky look because there was no beltline shoulder resulting in a large expanse of rear quarter panel. This was most evident in the two-door hardtop model where the &quot;greenhouse looked turret-topped.&quot; The two-door hardtop&#x27;s new look was harking back to the club coupes of the 1940s.

The 1970 Chryslers received minor styling changes to the grille, taillamps, and trim. The small vent windows on the front doors were dropped on the two-door hardtops.

Due to lower-than-expected sales, the facelift scheduled for 1971 was put off until 1972. Thus, the 1971 models only received new grilles and taillamps. Ventless front-door windows on the four-door sedan and hardtop were new this year. A new &quot;Torsion-Quiet&quot; system was introduced which added rubber cushions and blocks to isolate the suspension.

The 1972 model year engine output ratings dropped to meet stricter emissions standards and rising gas prices. Chryslers received a new &#x27;split grille&#x27; similar to the 1971–1974 Dodge Chargers. This would be the last year for the &#x27;loop&#x27;-style front bumpers on Chryslers.

The &quot;Fuselage Styling&quot; continued through the 1973 model year. However, the massive loop bumper was replaced with a new squared-off front end featuring a new bumper with rubber-faced guards to withstand the new 5-mph collision standards. The four-door hardtop was the best-seller for 1973 with 26,635 made, followed by the two-door hardtop with 9,190, and 8,541 four-door sedans.

==1974–1978==
The 1974 models were the last full-size models Chrysler designed from the ground up. The rounded &quot;Fuselage Styling&quot; gave way to an even more massive slab-sided body on all full-size Chryslers. This generation utilized popular styling motifs, primarily used on the Lincoln Continental. However, they debuted almost simultaneously with the start of the 1973 OPEC oil embargo. They contributed to the automaker&#x27;s economic woes in the late 1970s.

The 1974 New Yorkers emphasized luxury and comfort with roomy interiors, plush upholstery, additional sound insulation, and more standard amenities. Two New Yorker trim levels were offered in 1974, the base New Yorker and an upgraded New Yorker Brougham. The listed retail price for the four-door hardtop sedan was US$6,611 ($ in dollars ) and 13,165 were sold, while the St. Regis appearance option package returned from the mid-1950s and was added mid-year offering fixed formal opera windows, body paint accent stripes and a forward half-covered vinyl covered roof. The V8 became the standard engine on the New Yorker replacing the previous V8. Fuel economy decreased because of the larger engine and the car&#x27;s heavier weight.

The 1975 model year New Yorkers were largely a carryover. They received a slightly revised grille, and New Yorker Brougham became the sole trim designation. The St. Regis package, introduced in mid-1974, returned for its first full year.

The 1976 New Yorker inherited the front and rear-end styling of the discontinued Imperial, including the covered headlights flanking the vertical waterfall split grille topped with a hood ornament. The rear end included vertical taillamps finishing the peaked rear fenders between a massive rear bumper. The Imperial styling gave the New Yorker an unforeseen boost in sales, as the car looked distinctly different from the lower-priced Newport. In turn, the styling cues formerly used on the 1974 and 1975 New Yorkers were passed on to the Chrysler Newport Custom, which was positioned between the standard Newport and the New Yorker. The 1976 New Yorker also inherited the Imperial&#x27;s interior styling. The Chrysler New Yorker Brougham, introduced as an optional trim package in 1974, became the standalone top-of-the-line model for 1976. Brougham offered a higher level of luxury appointments compared to the standard New Yorker. Upgrades included premium upholstery in leather or plush fabrics, enhanced woodgrain interior trim, and additional exterior badging. The standard engine, V8, included &quot;lean-burn&quot; and was rated at and of torque.

In 1977, the standard V8 engine was revised to include a new computer-controlled &quot;lean burn&quot; system, allowing for more responsive acceleration and performance, but was aimed to improve fuel efficiency. However, the technology could be problematic and require maintenance. The V8 was available, rated at and of torque. This was needed for the weight of a typical New Yorker.

The 1978 New Yorker Brougham was available in two-door and four-door hardtop body styles. Both were the last U.S.-built true pillarless hardtop models with frameless door glass and fully opening windows. An optional &quot;St. Regis&quot; package included a partial &quot;formal&quot; padded vinyl roof that had a fixed B-pillar and opera window. This was also the final year a two-door New Yorker was offered. Appearance changes were limited to a new segmented grill design, dual accent tape strips on the lower body sides, new rear deck stripes, and bright accents on the taillamps. The V8 engine ( in California and high altitude regions) became the standard engine, with the optional. The last year of the C-body New Yorker Broughams saw engineering changes, including a revised windshield wiper linkage bushing, redesigned front and rear plastic fender extensions for the bumpers, and thinner glass.

==1979–1981==

The 1979 R-body series was a &quot;pillared hardtop.&quot; The V8 was standard, the optional through 1980. While shorter and much lighter than the previous generation, these cars still had a big car look and ride. Hidden headlamps and full-width taillights distinguished it from its R-body siblings, the Chrysler Newport, Dodge St. Regis and Plymouth Gran Fury. A new &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; trim package was offered. Sales were robust, with almost 55,000 cars sold with a listed retail price of $8,631 ($ in dollars ).

The exterior colors offered were Dove Gray, Formal Black, Nightwatch Blue, Spinnaker White, metallic Teal Frost, Regent Red Sunfire, Sable Tan Sunfire, Medium Cashmere, Frost Blue and Teal Green Sunfire and were shared with the Newport. The interior offered a front bench seat with a 60/40 split upholstered in Richton cloth and vinyl with a folding center armrest. The front suspension continued to offer Chryslers signature longitudinal front torsion bars, called Torsion-Aire, and anti-sway bar with a solid rear limited-slip differential connected to leaf springs.

To add to its exclusivity, Chrysler offered &quot;Convenience and Appearance Options&quot;. The list offered Open Road Handling Package, Two-Tone Paint, interior lighting, air conditioning with an upgraded climate control feature, rear window defroster, cruise control, power adjustable front seat, power windows, power electric door locks, power trunk release, luxury appearance steering wheel with an extra cost leather wrapped feature, digital clock, locking gas cap, lighting and mirrors, halogen headlamps, cornering lamps, electric adjustable outside sideview mirrors, several AM/FM radio or separate stereo radio choices to include CB and 8-track cassette player, power electric extendable antenna, various vinyl side moldings and bumper guards, undercoating, color keyed seat belts, wheel covers, and aluminum wheels, all at extra cost.

In 1980 the New Yorker gained an upscale &quot;Special Edition&quot; trim package, featuring a brushed stainless steel roof treatment and exclusive mahogany metallic paint, and was more modest to the top level &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; appearance and equipment option package, while six two-tone color combinations were also added to the options list. Sales were just over 13,500 cars as the price increased to $10,459 ($ in dollars ). The early 1980s recession in the United States had begun to take effect, and sales of large and expensive cars were particularly impacted.

In 1981 a bold new grille with simple vertical ribs appeared. The &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; option package remained, and a heavily optioned &quot;Carriage Roof&quot; package was added, available only in Nightwatch Blue or Mahogany Metallic, along with an extensive list of optional equipment. With a suggested retail price increased to US$10,459 ($ in dollars ) with an additional Fifth Avenue trim package price of US$1,300 ($ in dollars ), sales plummeted again, to just over 6,500 cars.


==1982==

For 1982, the New Yorker underwent further downsizing with the model name being placed on a restyled and upgraded M-body LeBaron. In turn, the LeBaron, an M-body since 1977, was downsized onto the front-wheel drive Chrysler K-body. The smaller New Yorker was now propelled by Chrysler&#x27;s slant-six engine, with the 318 V8 the only engine option. The 1982 New Yorker was available in base and Fifth Avenue trims. Both used the formal roof treatment.

The Fifth Avenue package gave buyers a choice of pillowed &quot;Corinthian&quot; leather or Kimberley velvet seats while base models had cloth or optional leather seats. The 318 V8 engine came standard with the Fifth Avenue package, along with illuminated entry system, power door locks, power driver&#x27;s seat, power trunk release, AM/FM stereo, speed control, leather wrapped steering wheel, deluxe intermittent wipers, and wire wheel covers.

This car became the &quot;Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue&quot; for 1983, and for 1984 the &quot;New Yorker&quot; prefix was dropped altogether; becoming the &quot;Chrysler Fifth Avenue&quot;.

==1983–1988==


In 1983, the New Yorker name was used on two different models. The M-body car was now the &quot;New Yorker Fifth Avenue&quot; a name which changed to simply &quot;Fifth Avenue&quot; from 1984 until 1989. The other was an all-new K-car based New Yorker, which used the front-wheel drive Chrysler E platform, the beginning of the extended K-car years. It was the first Chrysler manufactured vehicle to offer a four-cylinder engine since the 1932 Plymouth Model PA using the Chrysler flathead four cylinder.

The E-platform New Yorker came with state-of-the-art 1980s technology, including a digital dashboard and Electronic Voice Alert, which spoke notifications such as &quot;A door is ajar&quot;; &quot;Please fasten your seat belts&quot;; &quot;Don&#x27;t forget your keys&quot;; &quot;Thank you&quot; (after fastening the seat belt, closing the door tightly or removing the key from the ignition switch); &quot;Your engine oil pressure is low - prompt service is required&quot;. Also standard was a Landau vinyl roof with electroluminescent opera lamps. This was the only Chrysler New Yorker generation with an inline-four engine. 1983 was a limited production year for the FWD New Yorker. When introduced in 1983, it shared many elements with the Chrysler E-Class and had a waterfall grille that was slightly different from the 1984-1988 versions.

For 1984, restyled wraparound taillights and a revised front grille were among the cosmetic changes. A 2.2 L I4 turbo engine was now an option and new electronic instrumentation featured a digital speedometer and odometer. Pillowed velvet seats replaced deep-nap cloth seats as standard.

In 1985, the standard engine switched from the 2.2 L I4 to a Mitsubishi-sourced 2.6 L I4. New standard interior features included an overhead storage console with reading lamps, rear-seat headrests, and power windows.

In 1986, a Chrysler-built 2.5 L I4 replaced the 2.6 L I4 as the standard engine. Also new was an automatic load-leveling suspension. Cosmetically, rear decklid panels, moldings, and taillights were redesigned. Interior changes included a new forward console and revised electronic instrumentation and an AM/FM stereo and deluxe intermittent wipers were now standard.

In 1987, hood vents were eliminated on the turbo models, as were fender louvers on all models. A new six-speaker Infinity sound system was optional. As with other Chryslers, the steering wheel was redesigned. This was the best-selling and last full model year for the E-platform New Yorker.

Although a new thirteenth generation New Yorker was introduced for 1988, the twelfth generation continued for one more abbreviated model year as the 1988 New Yorker Turbo. The 2.2 L I4 turbo was now the standard and only available engine. In addition to the turbo engine, previously optional yet commonly ordered equipment like automatic temperature control air conditioning, tilt steering wheel, cruise control, rear-window defogger, and power door locks became standard. While previous model year New Yorkers equipped with the optional turbo engine were commonly referred to as a &quot;New Yorker Turbo&quot; and wore &quot;Turbo&quot; badges, only the 1988 model had it as its official model name.


==1988–1993==


The redesigned New Yorker for 1988 was larger (see Chrysler C platform), with many underbody and suspension components carried over and sharing much of its design with the rebadged variant, the Dodge Dynasty. The new version had a V6 engine — a Mitsubishi-sourced 3.0 L unit instead of the Chrysler LA series 3.9 L V6 engine and optional anti-lock brakes. Base and Landau trim choices were offered, the latter of which carried a rear-quarter vinyl top. Hidden headlamps, a feature lost when the R-body cars were discontinued, returned. All thirteenth generation New Yorkers, as well as the reintroduced flagship 1990-1993 Imperial, were covered by Chrysler&#x27;s market-leading &quot;Crystal Key Owner Care Program&quot; which included a 5-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and 7-year/70,000-mile powertrain warranty. A 24-hour toll-free customer service hotline was also provided.

For 1989, the 3.0 L V6 engine had a slight horsepower increase and was now mated to a new 4-speed Ultradrive automatic transmission. This year also marked the 50th anniversary of the &quot;New Yorker&quot; name. Although no special anniversary edition or recognition was offered at the time, it turned out to be the most popular New Yorker of the model run with over 100,000 units produced that year.

In 1990, a base model New Yorker, marketed as the &quot;Salon&quot; was added. The Salon was a rebadged Dodge Dynasty with exposed headlamps, horizontal taillights, and a grille similar to the Dodge. The Salon was marketed in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty. All models carried a new Chrysler-built 3.3 L V6 engine that year. Minor changes to the interior included a revised, contoured dash. A driver&#x27;s side airbag was now standard.

The Landau model was dropped for 1991 but Salon was upgraded and included more standard equipment, hidden headlights, vertical taillights, and a traditional Chrysler grille.

A styling update for 1992 produced a more rounded appearance front and rear. A padded landau roof, similar to one previously featured on the &quot;Landau&quot; model, was now an option on the Salon.

Last year&#x27;s restyle carried into 1993. The last thirteenth generation New Yorker was manufactured on May 28, 1993.

===New Yorker Fifth Avenue===
In 1990, a stretched-wheelbase variant of the New Yorker was offered, marketed as the New Yorker Fifth Avenue and replacing the just-departed M-body platform. This model was discontinued in 1993.


==1994–1996==
The final generation of the New Yorker continued with front-wheel drive on an elongated version of the new Chrysler LH platform and was shown at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It was released in May 1993 along with the nearly identical Chrysler LHS as an early 1994 model, six months after the original LH cars: the Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid, and Eagle Vision, were introduced. The New Yorker came standard with the 3.5 L &quot;EGE&quot; which produced . Chrysler gave the New Yorker a more &quot;traditional American&quot; luxury image, and the LHS a more European performance image (as was done with the Eagle Vision). Little separated New Yorker from LHS in appearance, with New Yorker&#x27;s chrome hood trim, body-color cladding, standard chrome wheel covers, and 15-inch wheels, column shifter and front bench seat, being the only noticeable differences. An option provided for 16-inch wheels and a firmer suspension type (&quot;touring suspension&quot;). This option eliminated the technical differences between the New Yorker and LHS. LHS came with almost all of New Yorker&#x27;s optional features as standard equipment and featured the firmer tuned suspension, to go with its more European image. This model was also officially sold by Chrysler in Europe.

During the 1994 model run, various changes were made to the New Yorker. On the outside, New Yorker was switched to new accent-color body cladding, whereas LHS received body-color cladding. This change aligned New Yorker with the Chrysler Concorde which also had accent-color cladding. The 16-inch wheels became standard. Likewise, the touring suspension option available on early 1994 New Yorker models was discontinued, leaving only &quot;ride-tuned&quot; suspension. This resulted in a permanent technical difference with LHS.

For 1995, the New Yorker received Chrysler&#x27;s revived blue ribbon logo (which was last used in the 1950s) on its grille, which replaced the Pentastar that had been used on models beginning in 1980.

The 1996 model featured additional sound insulation and revised structural engineering to give it a quieter ride. A new built-in transmitter replaced the remote garage door opener. The antenna was now integrated into the rear window. Due to similarities between the New Yorker and LHS, and the LHS&#x27;s strong sales, the New Yorker name was dropped after a short 1996 production run. Despite being far more contemporary and monochromatic in design compared to previous models, the traditional New Yorker with its two-tone cladding and chrome trim still did not follow the modern, monochromatic styling trend of the division&#x27;s other vehicles in 1996.

===LH design background===
The fourteenth, and final, generation New Yorker&#x27;s design can be traced to 1986, when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called &quot;Navajo&quot;. The design never passed the clay model stage.

It was also at this time that the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini. The &quot;Navajo&#x27;s&quot; exterior design was reworked and became the Lamborghini Portofino, released as a concept at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler&#x27;s decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino&#x27;s revolutionary exterior design, called &quot;cab-forward&quot;. The cab forward design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time.

Design of the chassis began in the late 1980s, after Chrysler had bought another automaker: American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler Fifth Avenue as well as a potential Plymouth. The initial design of Dodge&#x27;s LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after François Castaing, formerly AMC&#x27;s Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler&#x27;s Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. The new design, under Castaing&#x27;s leadership, began with the Eagle Premier, also sold later as the Dodge Monaco. The Premier&#x27;s longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated &quot;LH&quot; and &quot;LX&quot; respectively). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 Eagle Optima.

The transmission was inspired by the Eagle Premier&#x27;s ZF automatic. However, it borrowed heavily from Chrysler&#x27;s A604 (41TE) &quot;Ultradrive&quot; transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE). This Ultradrive transmission however was not without critics as &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on January 25, 1991, that Consumers Union would publish in the February 1991 issue of the magazine Consumer Reports a warning for consumers to &quot;not&quot; purchase a vehicle with this &quot;Ultradrive&quot; transmission citing poor reliability and safety hazards. By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler&#x27;s 3.3 L pushrod V6, which would be used in the three original LH cars, the Intrepid, Vision, and Concorde, in base form. The 3.3 L engine&#x27;s 60° block was bored out to 3.5 L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, creating an advanced 3.5 L V6 optional in the three smaller cars, but standard in LHS and New Yorker.

The general LH appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept, with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the LH cars a low drag coefficient which was ahead of its time. The New Yorker featured a more monochromatic design inside and out (but less so than its LHS sibling, which had very little chrome trim), and aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design. The single color motif was more pronounced on models without the grey lower cladding.

Upscale New Yorker models feature leather-trimmed seats, steering wheel, shift knob, and door inserts. Passenger comforts include rear center rear armrest, and 8-way power seats for both the driver and passenger, as well as personal reading lamps. Power windows and central door locks were standard, as was climate control with air conditioning, and cruise control. remote keyless entry available as an option, as was a remote activated alarm, an overhead console with a computer, power moonroof, and alloy wheels. The best stock audio options found in New Yorker are the Infinity sound systems having eight speakers positioned throughout the cabin along with an equalizer. Head units include a radio with either cassette or CD playback, and up to a five-band adjustable graphic equalizer, with joystick balance and fade control. Standard safety features included dual front airbags, anti-lock brakes (ABS), and traction control.

Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof Corp. (now ASC Global) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or onboard computer with integrated map lights, was retained.

===LHS===
The five-passenger Chrysler LHS was differentiated from its New Yorker counterpart by a floor console and shifter, five-passenger seating, lack of chrome trim, an upgraded interior, and a sportier image. After a short 1996 production run the New Yorker was dropped in favor of a six-passenger option on the 1996-1997 LHS. The LHS received a minor face change in 1995 when the corporate-wide Pentastar emblem was replaced with the revived Chrysler brand emblem.

<text>The photorefractive effect is a nonlinear optical effect seen in certain crystals and other materials that respond to light by altering their refractive index.
The effect can be used to store temporary, erasable holograms and is useful for holographic data storage.
It can also be used to create a phase-conjugate mirror or an optical spatial soliton.

==Mechanism==
The photorefractive effect occurs in several stages:
#A photorefractive material is illuminated by coherent beams of light. (In holography, these would be the signal and reference beams). Interference between the beams results in a pattern of dark and light fringes throughout the crystal.
#In regions where a bright fringe is present, electrons can absorb the light and be photoexcited from an impurity level into the conduction band of the material, leaving an electron hole (a net positive charge). Impurity levels have an energy intermediate between the energies of the valence band and conduction band of the material.
#Once in the conduction band, the electrons are free to move and diffuse throughout the crystal. Since the electrons are being excited preferentially in the bright fringes, the net electron diffusion current is towards the dark-fringe regions of the material.
#While in the conduction band, the electrons may with some probability recombine with the holes and return to the impurity levels. The rate at which this recombination takes place determines how far the electrons diffuse, and thus the overall strength of the photorefractive effect in that material. Once back in the impurity level, the electrons are trapped and can no longer move unless re-excited back into the conduction band (by light).
#With the net redistribution of electrons into the dark regions of the material, leaving holes in the bright areas, the resulting charge distribution causes an electric field, known as a &quot;space charge field&quot; to be set up in the crystal. Since the electrons and holes are trapped and immobile, the space charge field persists even when the illuminating beams are removed.
#The internal space charge field, via the electro–optic effect, causes the refractive index of the crystal to change in the regions where the field is strongest. This causes a spatially varying refractive index grating to occur throughout the crystal. The pattern of the grating that is formed follows the light interference pattern originally imposed on the crystal.
#The refractive index grating can now diffract light shone into the crystal, with the resulting diffraction pattern recreating the original pattern of light stored in the crystal.

==Application==
The photorefractive effect can be used for dynamic holography, and, in particular, for cleaning of coherent beams. 
For example, in the case of a hologram, illuminating the grating with just the reference beam causes the reconstruction of the original signal beam. When two coherent laser beams (usually obtained by splitting a laser beam by the use of a beamsplitter into two, and then suitably redirecting by mirrors) cross inside a photorefractive crystal, the resultant refractive index grating diffracts the laser beams. As a result, one beam gains energy and becomes more intense at the expense of light intensity reduction of the other. This phenomenon is an example of two-wave mixing. In this configuration, Bragg diffraction condition is automatically satisfied.

The pattern stored inside the crystal persists until the pattern is erased; this can be done by flooding the crystal with uniform illumination which will excite the electrons back into the conduction band and allow them to be distributed more uniformly.

Photorefractive materials include barium titanate (BaTiO3), lithium niobate (LiNbO3), vanadium doped zinc telluride (ZnTe:V), organic photorefractive materials, certain photopolymers, and some multiple quantum well structures.

<text>3552 Don Quixote, provisionally designated , is an exceptionally eccentric asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Amor group, Mars-crosser and Jupiter-crosser, as well as a weakly active comet.

== Discovery and naming ==

The asteroid was discovered on 26 September 1983, by Swiss astronomer Paul Wild at Zimmerwald Observatory near Bern, Switzerland. It was named after the comic knight who is the eponymous hero of Cervantes″ Spanish novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605). The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 2 December 1990 ().

== Orbit and characteristics ==

&quot;Don Quixote&quot; is characterized as a dark D-type asteroid in the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy.

It has a highly inclined comet-like orbit of 31 degrees that leads to frequent perturbations by Jupiter. Don Quixote measures 18.4 kilometres in diameter and has a rotation period of 7.7 hours.

Due to its comet-like orbit and albedo, Don Quixote has been suspected to be an extinct comet. However, infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope at 4.5 μm revealed a faint coma and tail around the object. The cometary activity is inferred by carbon dioxide () molecular band emission. In March 2018 a tail was observed at visible wavelengths for the first time. The observation of cometary features during two apparitions suggests that cometary activity is recurrent and Don Quixote is most likely a weakly active comet.

<text>The Cipher Bureau (Polish: &quot;Biuro Szyfrów&quot;, ) was the interwar Polish General Staff&#x27;s Second Department&#x27;s unit charged with SIGINT and both cryptography (the &quot;use&quot; of ciphers and codes) and cryptanalysis (the &quot;study&quot; of ciphers and codes, for the purpose of &quot;breaking&quot; them).

The precursor of the agency that would become the Cipher Bureau was created in May 1919, during the Polish-Soviet War (1919–1921), and played a vital role in securing Poland&#x27;s survival and victory in that war.

In mid-1931, the Cipher Bureau was formed by the merger of pre-existing agencies. In December 1932, the Bureau began breaking Germany&#x27;s Enigma ciphers. Over the next seven years, Polish cryptologists overcame the growing structural and operating complexities of the plugboard-equipped Enigma. The Bureau also broke Soviet cryptography.

Five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British military intelligence, which had been unable to make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.

==Background==
On 8 May 1919 Lt. Józef Serafin Stanslicki established a Polish Army &quot;Cipher Section&quot; (), precursor to the &quot;Cipher Bureau&quot; (). The Cipher Section reported to the Polish General Staff and contributed substantially to Poland&#x27;s defense by Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s forces during the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–1921, thereby helping preserve Poland&#x27;s independence, recently regained in the wake of World War I. The &quot;Cipher&quot; Section&#x27;s purview included both ciphers and codes. In Polish the term &quot;cipher&quot; () loosely refers to &quot;both&quot; these two principal categories of cryptography. (Compare the opposite practice in English, which loosely refers to &quot;both&quot; codes and ciphers as &quot;codes&quot;.)

During the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921), approximately a hundred Russian ciphers were broken by a sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who included army Lieutenant Jan Kowalewski and three world-famous professors of mathematics – Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński, and Stanisław Leśniewski. Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had Tsarist army staffs during World War I, to the decisive advantage of their German enemy. As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.

The Soviet staffs, according to Polish Colonel Mieczysław Ścieżyński,


In the crucial month of August 1920 alone, Polish cryptologists decrypted 410 signals:
* from Soviet General Mikhail Tukhachevsky, commander of the northern front
* from Leon Trotsky, Soviet commissar of war
* from commanders of armies, for example:
** the commander of the , 
** the commander of the 1st Cavalry Army, Semyon Budionny
** the commander of the , Gai
* from the staffs of the XII, XV and XVI Armies
* from the staffs of:
** the Mozyr Group (named after the Belarusian city)
** the Zolochiv Group (after the Ukrainian town)
** the Yakir Group [after General Iona Emmanuilovich Yakir]
* from the 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27, 41, 44, 45, 53, 54, 58 and 60 Infantry Divisions
* from the 8 Cavalry Division
etc.

The intercepts were as a rule decrypted the same day, or at latest the next day, and were immediately sent to the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Section II (Intelligence) and operational section. The more important signals were read in their entirety by the Chief of the General Staff, and even by the Commander in Chief, Marshal Józef Piłsudski. Interception and reading of the signals provided Polish intelligence with entire Russian operational orders. The Poles were able to follow the whole operation of Budionny&#x27;s Cavalry Army in the second half of August 1920 with incredible precision, just by monitoring his radiotelegraphic correspondence with Tukhachevsky, including the famous and historic conflict between the two Russian commanders.

The intercepts even included an order from Trotsky to the revolutionary council of war of the Western Front, confirming Tukhachevsky&#x27;s operational orders, thus giving them the authority of the supreme chief of the Soviet armed forces. An entire operational order from Tukhachevsky to Budionny was intercepted on 19 August and read on 20 August, stating the tasks of all of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s armies, of which only the essence had previously been known.

Ścieżyński surmises that the Soviets must likewise have intercepted Polish operational signals; but he doubts that this would have availed them much, since Polish cryptography &quot;stood abreast of modern cryptography&quot; and since only a small number of Polish higher headquarters were equipped with radio stations, of which there was a great shortage; and finally, Polish headquarters were more cautious than the Russians and almost every Polish division had the use of a land line.

Polish cryptologists enjoyed generous support under the command of Col. Tadeusz Schaetzel, chief of the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Section II (Intelligence). They worked at Warsaw&#x27;s radio station &quot;WAR&quot;, one of two Polish long-range radio transmitters at the time. The Polish cryptologists&#x27; work led, among many other things, to the discovery of a large gap on the Red Army&#x27;s left flank, which enabled Poland&#x27;s Marshal Józef Piłsudski to drive a war-winning wedge into that gap during the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw.

The discovery of the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s archives, decades after the Polish-Soviet War, has borne out Ścieżyński&#x27;s assertion

==Cipher Bureau==
In mid-1931, at the Polish General Staff, a Cipher Bureau was formed by merging the Radio-Intelligence Office () and the Polish-Cryptography Office (). The Bureau was charged with both cryptography – the generation, and supervision of the use, of ciphers and codes – and cryptology – the study of ciphers and codes, particularly for the purpose of breaking them.

Between 1932 and 1936, the Cipher Bureau took on additional responsibilities, including radio communications between military intelligence posts in Poland and abroad, as well as radio counterintelligence – mobile direction-finding and intercept stations for the locating and traffic analysis of spy and fifth column transmitters operating in Poland.

==Stalking Enigma==

In late 1927 or early 1928, there arrived at the Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, according to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment. The German firm&#x27;s representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, as it had been shipped with other equipment by mistake. His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff&#x27;s Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology. Since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau&#x27;s experts had ample time to look into the matter. They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine. They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.

The Bureau&#x27;s leading Enigma cryptanalyst Marian Rejewski commented that the cipher machine may be surmised to have been a &quot;commercial&quot;-model Enigma since at that time the military model had not yet been devised. &quot;Hence this trivial episode was of no practical importance, though it does fix the date at which the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s interest in the Enigma machine began&quot;manifested, initially, in the entirely legal acquisition of a single commercial-model Enigma.

On 15 July 1928, the first German machine-enciphered messages were broadcast by German military radio stations. Polish monitoring stations began intercepting them, and cryptologists in the Polish Cipher Bureau&#x27;s German section were instructed to try to read them. The effort was fruitless, however, and was eventually abandoned. There remained very slight evidence of the effort, in the form of a few densely written-over sheets of paper and the commercial-model Enigma machine. On 15 January 1929 Major Gwido Langer, after a tour of duty as chief of staff of the 1st Legion Infantry Division, became chief of the Radio-Intelligence Office, and subsequently of the Cipher Bureau. The Bureau&#x27;s deputy chief, and the chief of its German section (&quot;BS-4&quot;), was Captain Maksymilian Ciężki.

In 1929, while the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s predecessor agency was still headed by Major Franciszek Pokorny (a relative of the outstanding World War I Austro-Hungarian Army cryptologist, Captain Herman Pokorny), Ciężki, Franciszek Pokorny, and a civilian Bureau associate, Antoni Palluth, taught a secret cryptology course at Poznań University for selected mathematics students. Over ten years later, during World War II while in France, one of the students, Marian Rejewski, would discover that the entire course had been taught from French General Marcel Givièrge&#x27;s book, (Course of Cryptography), published in 1925.

In September 1932, Maksymilian Ciężki hired three young graduates of the Poznań course to be Bureau staff members: Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Różycki and Henryk Zygalski.

==Successes and setbacks==
In 1926, the German Navy adopted, as its top cryptographic device, a modified civilian Enigma machine; in 1928 the German Army followed suit. The complexity of the system was much increased in 1930 by the introduction of a plugboard (), albeit with only six connecting leads in use. In December 1932, Marian Rejewski made what historian David Kahn describes as one of the greatest advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure mathematicsthe theory of permutations and groupsto breaking the German armed forces&#x27; Enigma machine ciphers. Rejewski had worked out the precise interconnections of the Enigma rotors and reflector, after the Bureau had received, from French Military Intelligence Captain Gustave Bertrand, two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year). These had been obtained by a French military intelligence agent, a German codenamed &quot;Rex&quot;, from an agent who worked at Germany&#x27;s Cipher Office in Berlin, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, whom the French codenamed . 
After Rejewski had worked out the military Enigma&#x27;s logical structure, the Polish Cipher Bureau commissioned the AVA Radio Company, co-owned by Antoni Palluth, to build replicas (&quot;doubles&quot;) of the Enigma to Rejewski&#x27;s specifications. His method of decrypting Enigma messages exploited two weaknesses of the German operating procedures. It used what Rejewski called &quot;characteristics&quot; that were independent of the plugboard connections. This involved compiling a card catalog of certain features of the set of indicator settings.

The Germans increased the difficulty of decrypting Enigma messages by decreasing the interval between changes in the order of the rotors from quarterly, initially, to monthly in February 1936, then daily in October of that year, when they also increased the number of plugboard leads from six to a number that varied between five and eight. This made the Biuro&#x27;s grill method much less easy, as it relied on &#x27;unsteckered&#x27; letter pairs. The German navy was more security-conscious than the army and air force, and in May 1937 it introduced a new, much more secure, indicator procedure that remained unbroken for several years.

The next setback occurred in November 1937, when the scrambler&#x27;s reflector was changed to one with different interconnections (known as ). Rejewski worked out the wiring in the new reflector, but the catalogue of characteristics had to be compiled anew, again using Rejewski&#x27;s &quot;cyclometer&quot;, which had been built to his specifications by the AVA Radio Company.

In January 1938, Colonel Stefan Mayer directed that statistics be compiled for a two-week period, comparing the numbers of Enigma messages solved, to Enigma intercepts. The ratio came to 75 percent. &quot;Nor&quot;, Marian Rejewski has commented, &quot;were those 75 percent ... the limit of our possibilities. With slightly augmented personnel, we might have attained about 90 percent ... read. But a certain amount of cipher material ... due to faulty transmission or ... reception, or to various other causes, always remains unread&quot;. Information obtained from Enigma decryption seems to have been directed from B.S.-4 principally to the German Office of the General Staff&#x27;s Section II (Intelligence). There, from fall 1935 to mid-April 1939, it was worked up by Major Jan Leśniak, who in April 1939 would turn the German Office over to another officer and himself form a Situation Office intended for wartime service. He would head the Situation Office to and through the September 1939 Campaign.

The system of pre-defining the indicator setting for the day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. The one exception to this was the network used by the (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—who did not make the change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the (cryptologic bomb).

Both the Zygalski-sheet method and each worked for only a single scrambler rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six were produced. However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day. This increased the number of possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors. This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.

When World War II broke out on 1 September 1939, Leśniak and his colleagues had been working intensively for two or three years to establish the German order of battle and had succeeded in working out nearly 95 percent of it. The German attack on Poland came as no surprise to the Polish General Staff. The results that had been obtained by Polish intelligence, according to Leśniak, &quot;absolutely exceeded what would normally have been possible&quot;.

==Kabaty Woods==

Until 1937 the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s German section, &quot;BS-4&quot;, had been housed in the Polish General Staff building – the stately 18th-century &quot;Saxon Palace&quot; – in Warsaw. That year BS-4 moved into specially constructed new facilities in the Kabaty Woods near Pyry, south of Warsaw. There, working conditions were incomparably better than in the cramped quarters at the General Staff building.

The move was dictated as well by requirements of security. Germany&#x27;s was always looking for potential traitors among the military and civilian workers at the General Staff building. Strolling agents, even if lacking access to the Staff building, could observe personnel entering and leaving, and photograph them with concealed miniature cameras. Annual intelligence assignments for German agents in Warsaw placed a priority on securing informants at the Polish General Staff.

==Gift to allies==
It was in the Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939, with war looming, that, on instructions from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland&#x27;s achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook to give each country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski&#x27;s cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain&#x27;s Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy&#x27;s intercept and direction-finding stations.

When Rejewski had been working on reconstructing the German military Enigma machine in late 1932, he had ultimately solved a crucial element, the wiring of the letters of the alphabet into the entry drum, with the inspired guess that they might be wired in simple &quot;alphabetical&quot; order. Now, at the trilateral meetingRejewski was later to recount&quot;the first question that ... Dillwyn Knox asked was: &#x27;What are the connections in the entry drum? Knox was mortified to learn how simple the answer was.

The Poles&#x27; gift, to their western Allies, of Enigma decryption, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon. Former Bletchley Park mathematician-cryptologist Gordon Welchman later wrote: &quot;Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military ... Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.&quot; Allied Supreme Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower, at war&#x27;s end, described intelligence from Bletchley Park as having been &quot;of priceless value to me. It has simplified my task as a commander enormously.&quot; Eisenhower expressed his thanks for this &quot;decisive contribution to the Allied war effort&quot;.

British prime minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s greatest wartime fear, even after Hitler had suspended Operation Sea Lion and invaded the Soviet Union, was that the German submarine wolfpacks would succeed in strangling sea-locked Britain. A major factor that averted Britain&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of the Atlantic was her regained mastery of Naval Enigma decryption; and while the latter benefited crucially from British seizure of German Enigma-equipped naval vessels, the breaking of German naval signals ultimately relied on techniques that had been pioneered by the Polish Cipher Bureau. Had Britain capitulated to Hitler, the United States would have been deprived of an essential forward base for its subsequent involvement in the European and North African theaters.

A week after the Pyry meeting, Dillwyn Knox, in a letter dated 1 August 1939, thanked the Poles, in Polish, &quot;for your cooperation and patience&quot;. He enclosed little paper batons and a scarf picturing a Derby horse raceevidently emblematic of the cryptological race that Knox had hoped to win using the batons, and whose loss he was gallantly acknowledging.

On 5 September 1939, as it became clear that Poland was unlikely to halt the ongoing German invasion, BS-4 received orders to destroy part of its files and evacuate essential personnel.

==Bureau abroad==

During the German Invasion of Poland in September 1939, key Cipher Bureau personnel were evacuated southeast and – after the Soviets invaded eastern Poland on 17 September – into Romania, on the way destroying their cryptological equipment and documentation. Eventually, crossing Yugoslavia and still-neutral Italy, they reached France. Some personnel of the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s German section who had worked with Enigma, and most of the workers at the AVA Radio Company that had built Enigma doubles and cryptologic equipment for the German section, remained in Poland. Some were interrogated by the Gestapo, but no one gave away the secret of Polish mastery of Enigma decryption.
At &quot;PC Bruno&quot;, outside Paris, on 20 October 1939 the Poles resumed work on German Enigma ciphers in close collaboration with Britain&#x27;s Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.

In the interest of security, the Allied cryptological services, before sending their messages over a teleprinter line, encrypted them using Enigma doubles. Henri Braquenié often closed messages with a . As late as December 1939, when Lt. Col. Gwido Langer, accompanied by Captain Braquenié, visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be turned over to them. Langer, however, took the position that the Polish team must remain where the Polish Armed Forces were being formedon French soil. The mathematicians might actually have reached Britain much earlierand much more comfortablythan they eventually did; but in September 1939, when they went to the British embassy in Bucharest, Romania, they were brushed off by a preoccupied British diplomat.

In January 1940, the British cryptanalyst Alan Turing spent several days at PC Bruno conferring with his Polish colleagues. He had brought the Poles a full set of Zygalski sheets that had been produced at Bletchley Park by John Jeffreys using Polish-supplied information. On 17 January 1940, the Poles made the first break into wartime Enigma traffic – that from 28 October 1939.

During this period, until the collapse of France in June 1940, ultimately 83 percent of the Enigma keys that were found, were solved at Bletchley Park, the remaining 17 percent at PC Bruno. Rejewski commented:


The inter-Allied cryptologic collaboration prevented duplication of effort and facilitated discoveries. Before fighting had started in Norway in April 1940, the Polish-French team solved an uncommonly hard three-letter code used by the Germans to communicate with fighter and bomber squadrons and for exchange of meteorological data between aircraft and land. The code had first appeared in December 1939, but the Polish cryptologists had been too preoccupied with Enigma to give the code much attention. With the German assault on the west impending, however, the breaking of the code took on mounting urgency. The trail of the elusive code (whose system of letters changed every 24 hours) led back to Enigma. The first clue came from the British, who had noticed that the code&#x27;s letters did not change randomly. If &quot;A&quot; changed to &quot;P&quot;, then elsewhere &quot;P&quot; was replaced by &quot;A&quot;. The British made no further headway, but the Poles realized that what was manifesting was Enigma&#x27;s &quot;exclusivity principle&quot; that they had discovered in 1932. The Germans&#x27; carelessness meant that now the Poles, having after midnight solved Enigma&#x27;s daily setting, could with no further effort also read the signals.

The Germans, just before opening their 10 May 1940 offensive in the west that would trample Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands in order to reach the borders of France, once again changed their procedure for enciphering message keys, rendering the Zygalski sheets &quot;completely useless&quot; and temporarily defeating the joint British–Polish cryptologic attacks on Enigma. According to Gustave Bertrand, &quot;It took &quot;superhuman&quot; day-and-night effort to overcome this new difficulty: on May 20, decryption resumed.&quot;

Following the capitulation of France in June 1940, the Poles were evacuated to Algeria. On October 1, 1940, they resumed work at &quot;Cadix&quot;, near Uzès in unoccupied southern Vichy France, under the sponsorship of Gustave Bertrand.

A little over two years later, on 8 November 1942, Bertrand learned from the BBC that the Allies had landed in French North Africa (&quot;Operation Torch&quot;). Knowing that in such an eventuality the Germans planned to occupy Vichy France, on 9 November he evacuated Cadix. Two days later, on 11 November, the Germans indeed marched into southern France. On the morning of 12 November they occupied Cadix.

Over the two years since its establishment in October 1940, Cadix had decrypted thousands of Wehrmacht, SS and Gestapo messages, originating not only from French territory but from across Europe, which provided invaluable intelligence to Allied commands and resistance movements. Cadix had also decrypted thousands of Soviet messages.

Having departed Cadix, the Polish personnel evaded the occupying Italian security police and German Gestapo and sought to escape France via Spain. Jerzy Różycki, Jan Graliński and Piotr Smoleński had died in the January 1942 sinking, in the Mediterranean Sea, of a French passenger ship, the &quot;SS Lamoricière&quot;, in which they had been returning to southern France from a tour of duty in Algeria.

Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski hiked over the Pyrenees with a guide (who robbed them at gunpoint) to the Spanish border, where they were arrested on 30 January 1943. They were incarcerated by the Spaniards for three months before being released, upon Red Cross intervention, on 4 May 1943. They then managed, by a circuitous land–sea–air route, to join the Polish Armed Forces in Britain, Rejewski and Zygalski were inducted into the Polish Army as privates (they would eventually be promoted to lieutenant) and put to work breaking German &quot;SS&quot; and &quot;SD&quot; hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in Boxmoor. Because of their having been in occupied France, the British considered it too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park.

Finally, with the end of the two mathematicians&#x27; cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its inception in 1931 until war&#x27;s end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under cryptonyms (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists. In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980. Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.

==Secret preserved==
Despite their travails, Rejewski and Zygalski had fared better than some of their colleagues. Cadix&#x27;s Polish military chiefs, Langer and Ciężki, had also been capturedby the Germans, as they tried to escape from France into Spain on the night of 10–11 March 1943along with three other Poles: Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczyński and Kazimierz Gaca. The first two became prisoners of war; the other three were sent as slave labourers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczyński perished. Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of themStefan Mayer emphasizesbetrayed the secret of Enigma&#x27;s decryption, thus making it possible for the Allies to continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource.

Before the war, Palluth, a lecturer in the 1929 secret Poznań University cryptology course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the decryption technology. In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all kept silent about compromises to Enigma.

==In popular culture==
In 1967 the Polish military historian Władysław Kozaczuk, in his book &quot;Bitwa o tajemnice&quot; (&quot;The Battle for Secrets&quot;), first revealed that the German Enigma had been broken by Polish cryptologists before World War II. Kozaczuk&#x27;s disclosure came seven years before F. W. Winterbotham&#x27;s &quot;The Ultra Secret&quot; (1974) changed conventional views of the history of the war.

The 1979 Polish film (The Enigma Secret) is a generally fair, if superficial, account of the Cipher Bureau&#x27;s story. Twenty-two years later, the 2001 Hollywood film &quot;Enigma&quot; was criticized for its many historical inaccuracies, including omission of Poland&#x27;s fundamental work in Enigma decryption.

<text>This page is a list of [[Ministry of National Education (France)|French education ministers]].

A governmental position overseeing public education was first created in France in 1802. Following the various regime changes in France in the first decades of the 19th century, the position changed official status and name a number of times before the position of Minister of Public Instruction was created in 1828. For much of its history, the position was combined with that of Minister of Public Worship, who dealt with issues related to the Roman Catholic Church, except in instances where the Minister of Public Instruction was a Protestant. The position has also occasionally been combined with Minister of Sports and Minister of Youth Affairs. In 1932, the office&#x27;s title was changed to Minister of National Education, although it was briefly changed back in 1940–1941, and was renamed Minister of Education during the presidency of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing (1974–1981).

<doc id="625338" wikidata="Q151686" url="?curid=625338" title="3494 Purple Mountain">
<text>3494 Purple Mountain, provisional designation , is a bright Vestian asteroid and a formerly lost minor planet from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. First observed in 1962, it was officially discovered on 7 December 1980, by Chinese astronomers at the Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanking, China, and later named in honor of the discovering observatory. The V-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.9 hours.

== Orbit and classification ==
Purple Mountain is a core member of the Vesta family (), a giant asteroid family of typically bright V-type asteroids. Vestian asteroids have a composition akin to cumulate eucrites (HED meteorites) and are thought to have originated deep within 4 Vesta&#x27;s crust, possibly from the Rheasilvia crater, a large impact crater on its southern hemisphere near the South pole, formed as a result of a subcatastrophic collision. Vesta is the main belt&#x27;s second-largest and second-most-massive body after . Based on osculating Keplerian orbital elements, the asteroid has also been classified as a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt.

Purple Mountain orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 2.0–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,315 days; semi-major axis of 2.35 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in December 1951, or 29 years prior to its official discovery observation.

=== Lost asteroid ===
Purple Mountain has been a lost minor planet. In November 1962, Purple Mountain was observed as at Goethe Link Observatory. A total of three additional observations were taken at Crimea–Nauchnij in 1969 and 1972, when it was designated as and , respectively, but was subsequently lost with no follow-up observations until its official discovery at Nanking in 1980.

== Physical characteristics ==
Based on the Moving Object Catalog (MOC) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Purple Mountain is a common, stony S-type asteroid, with a sequential best-type taxonomy of SV. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; (CALL) also assumes it to be a stony S-type.

In the SMASS-I classification by Xu, the asteroid is a V-type. This agrees with its measured high albedo &quot;(see below)&quot; often seen among the core members of the Vesta family. In 2013, a spectroscopic analysis showed it to have a composition very similar to the cumulate eucrite meteorites, which also suggests that the basaltic asteroid has originated from the crust of 4 Vesta.

=== Rotation period ===
In June 2015, a rotational lightcurve of Purple Mountain was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers at Texas A&amp;M University, using the SARA-telescopes of the &quot;Southeastern Association for Research and Astronomy&quot; consortium. The 0.9-meter SARA-North telescope is located at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Arizona, while the 0.6-meter SARA-South telescope is hosted at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 5.857 hours with a brightness variation of 0.32 magnitude (). One month later, in July 2015, another period of 2.928 hours and an amplitude of 0.40 magnitude was measured at MIT&#x27;s George R. Wallace Jr. Observatory (). The results are in good agreement, apart from the fact that the latter is an alternative, monomodal solution with half the period of the former. CALL adopts the longer, bimodal period solution as the better result in its Lightcurve Data Base, due to the lightcurve&#x27;s distinct amplitude and the small phase angle of the first observation.

=== Diameter and albedo ===
According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Purple Mountain measures 6.507 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.347, while CALL assumes an albedo of 0.24 – derived from the body&#x27;s classification into the Flora family – and consequently calculates a larger diameter of 7.82 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.7.

== Naming ==
This minor planet was named in honor of the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO), an astronomical observatory located in Nanking (Nanjing), China. Built in 1934, the observatory is known for its astrometric observations and for its numerous discoveries of small Solar System bodies. It has played an important role in developing modern Chinese astronomy. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 29 November 1993 ().

<text>A nanopore is a pore of nanometer size. It may, for example, be created by a pore-forming protein or as a hole in synthetic materials such as silicon or graphene.

When a nanopore is present in an electrically insulating membrane, it can be used as a single-molecule detector. It can be a biological protein channel in a high electrical resistance lipid bilayer, a pore in a solid-state membrane or a hybrid of these – a protein channel set in a synthetic membrane. The detection principle is based on monitoring the ionic current passing through the nanopore as a voltage is applied across the membrane. When the nanopore is of molecular dimensions, passage of molecules (e.g., DNA) cause interruptions of the &quot;open&quot; current level, leading to a &quot;translocation event&quot; signal. The passage of RNA or single-stranded DNA molecules through the membrane-embedded alpha-hemolysin channel (1.5 nm diameter), for example, causes a ~90% blockage of the current (measured at 1 M KCl solution).

It may be considered a Coulter counter for much smaller particles.

== Types ==

=== Organic ===

* Nanopores may be formed by pore-forming proteins, typically a hollow core passing through a mushroom-shaped protein molecule. Examples of pore-forming proteins are alpha hemolysin, aerolysin, and MspA porin. In typical laboratory nanopore experiments, a single protein nanopore is inserted into a lipid bilayer membrane and single-channel electrophysiology measurements are taken. Newer pore-forming proteins have been extracted from bacteriophages for study into their use as nanopores. These pores are generally selected due to their diameter being above 2 nm, the diameter of double-stranded DNA.
* Larger nanopores can be up to 20 nm in a diameter. These pores allow small molecules like oxygen, glucose and insulin to pass however they prevent large immune system molecules like immunoglobins from passing. As an example, rat pancreatic cells are microencapsulated, they receive nutrients and release insulin through nanopores being totally isolated from their neighboring environment i.e. foreign cells. This knowledge can help to replace nonfunctional islets of Langerhans cells in the pancreas (responsible for producing insulin), by harvested piglet cells. They can be implanted underneath the human skin without the need of immunosuppressants which put diabetic patients at a risk of infection.

=== Inorganic ===

* Solid-state nanopores are generally made in silicon compound membranes, one of the most common being silicon nitride. The second type of widely used solid-state nanopores are glass nanopores fabricated by laser-assisted pulling of glass capillary. Solid-state nanopores can be manufactured with several techniques including ion-beam sculpting, dielectric breakdown, electron beam exposure using TEM and Ion track etching.
* More recently, the use of graphene as a material for solid-state nanopore sensing has been explored. Another example of solid-state nanopores is a box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure. The BSG nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface and having quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm. The typical width of channel facets makes about 25 nm.
* Size-tunable elastomeric nanopores have been fabricated, allowing accurate measurement of nanoparticles as they occlude the flow of ionic current. This measurement methodology can be used to measure a wide range of particle types. In contrast to the limitations of solid-state pores, they allow for the optimization of the resistance pulse magnitude relative to the background current by matching the pore-size closely to the particle-size. As detection occurs on a particle by particle basis, the true average and polydispersity distribution can be determined. Using this principle, the world&#x27;s only commercial tunable nanopore-based particle detection system has been developed by Izon Science Ltd. The box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure can be used as a basis for building devices with changeable pore sizes.

== Nanopore based sequencing ==

The observation that a passing strand of DNA containing different bases corresponds with shifts in current values has led to the development of nanopore sequencing. Nanopore sequencing can occur with bacterial nanopores as mentioned in the above section as well as with the Nanopore sequencing device(s) is created by Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

== Monomer identification ==
From a fundamental standpoint, nucleotides from DNA or RNA are identified based on shifts in current as the strand is entering the pore. The approach that Oxford Nanopore Technologies uses for nanopore DNA sequencing labeled DNA sample is loaded to the flow cell within the nanopore. The DNA fragment is guided to the nanopore and commences the unfolding of the helix. As the unwound helix moves through the nanopore, it is correlated with a change in the current value which is measured in thousand times per second. Nanopore analysis software can take this alternating current value for each base detected, and obtain the resulting DNA sequence. Similarly with the usage of biological nanopores, as a constant voltage is applied to the system, the alternating current can be observed. As DNA, RNA or peptides enter the pore, shifts in the current can be observed through this system that are characteristic of the monomer being identified.

Ion current rectification (ICR) is an important phenomenon for nanopore. Ion current rectification can also be used as a drug sensor and be employed to investigate charge status in the polymer membrane.

== Applications to nanopore sequencing ==
Apart from rapid DNA sequencing, other applications include separation of single stranded and double stranded DNA in solution, and the determination of length of polymers. At this stage, nanopores are making contributions to the understanding of polymer biophysics, single-molecule analysis of DNA-protein interactions, as well as peptide sequencing. When it comes to peptide sequencing bacterial nanopores like hemolysin, can be applied to both RNA, DNA and most recently protein sequencing. Such as when applied in a study in which peptides with the same Glycine-Proline-Proline repeat were synthesized, and then put through nanopore analysis, an accurate sequence was able to be attained. This can also be used to identify differences in stereochemistry of peptides based on intermolecular ionic interactions. Some configuration changes of protein could also be observed from the translocation curve. Understanding this also contributes more data to understanding the sequence of the peptide fully in its environment. Usage of another bacterial derived nanopore, an aerolysin nanopore, has shown ability having shown similar ability in distinguishing residues within a peptide has also shown the ability to identify toxins present even in proclaimed &quot;very pure&quot; protein samples, while demonstrating stability over varying pH values. A limitation to the usage of bacterial nanopores would be that peptides as short as six residues were accurately detected, but with larger more negatively charged peptides resulted in more background signal that is not representative of the molecule.

== Alternate applications ==
Since the discovery of track-etched technology in the late 1960s, filter membranes with needed diameter have found application potential in various fields including food safety, environmental pollution, biology, medicine, fuel cell, and chemistry. These track-etched membranes are typically made in polymer membrane through track-etching procedure, during which the polymer membrane is first irradiated by heavy ion beam to form tracks and then cylindrical pores or asymmetric pores are created along the track after wet etching.

As important as fabrication of the filter membranes with proper diameters, characterizations and measurements of these materials are of the same paramount. Until now, a few of methods have been developed, which can be classified into the following categories according to the physical mechanisms they exploited: imaging methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM); fluid transport such as bubble point and gas transport; fluid adsorptions such as nitrogen adsorption/desorption (BEH), mercury porosimetry, liquid-vapor equilibrium (BJH), gas-liquid equilibrium (permoporometry) and liquid-solid equilibrium (thermoporometry); electronic conductance; ultrasonic spectroscopy; and molecular transport.

More recently, the use of light transmission technique as a method for nanopore size measurement has been proposed.

<text>Agis II (; died 399 BC) was the 18th Eurypontid king of Sparta, the eldest son of Archidamus II by his first wife, and half-brother of Agesilaus II. He ruled with his Agiad co-monarch Pausanias.

==Life==
Agis succeeded his father Archidamus II in 427 BC, and reigned a little more than 26 years. In the summer of 426 BC, he led an army of Peloponnesians and their allies as far as the isthmus, with the intention of invading Attica; but they were deterred from advancing farther by a succession of earthquakes. In the spring of the following year he led an army into Attica, but ceased his advance fifteen days after he had entered Attica. In 419 BC, the Argives, at the instigation of Alcibiades, attacked Epidaurus; and Agis with a large force from Lacedaemon set out and marched to the frontier city of Leuctra. No one, Thucydides tells us, knew the purpose of this expedition. It was probably to make a diversion in favour of Epidaurus.

At Leuctra the unfavourable outcome of various sacrifices deterred Agis from proceeding. He therefore led his troops back, and sent around a notice to the allies to be ready for an expedition at the end of the sacred month of the Carneia festival. When the Argives repeated their attack on Epidaurus, the Spartans again marched to the frontier town, Caryae, and again turned back, supposedly on account of the aspect of the victims. In the middle of the following summer of 418 BC the Epidaurians, being still hard-pressed by the Argives, the Lacedaemonians with their whole force and some allies, under the command of Agis, invaded Argolis. By a skilful manoeuvre he succeeded in intercepting the Argives, and posted his army advantageously between them and the city. But just as the battle was about to begin, the Argive generals Thrasyllus and Alciphron met with Agis and prevailed on him to conclude a truce for four months.

Agis, without disclosing his motives, pulled his army back. On his return he was severely censured in Sparta for having thus thrown away the opportunity of reducing Argos, especially as the Argives had seized the opportunity afforded by his return and taken Orchomenus. It was proposed to pull down his house, and inflict on him a fine of 100,000 drachmas. But on his earnest entreaty they contented themselves with appointing a council of war, consisting of 10 Spartans, who needed to be present before he could lead an army out of the city. Shortly afterwards they received intelligence from Tegea, that, if not promptly reinforced, the party favourable to Sparta in that city would be compelled to surrender. The Spartans immediately sent their whole force under the command of Agis. He restored stability at Tegea, and then marched to Mantineia. By turning the waters to flood the lands of Mantineia, he succeeded in drawing the army of the Mantineans and Athenians down to the level ground. A battle ensued, in which the Spartans were victorious. The Battle of Mantinea was reckoned one of the most important battles ever fought between the Grecian states.

In 417 BC, when the news reached Sparta of the counter-revolution at Argos, in which the oligarchical and Spartan faction was overthrown, an army was sent there under Agis. He was unable to restore the defeated party, but he destroyed the long walls which the Argives had begun to extend down to the sea, and took Hysiae. In the spring of 413 BC, Agis entered Attica with a Peloponnesian army, and fortified Decelea; and in the winter of the same year, after the news of the disastrous fate of the Sicilian Expedition had reached Greece, he marched northwards to levy contributions on the allies of Sparta, for the purpose of constructing a fleet. While at Decelea he acted largely independent of the Spartan government, and received embassies from the disaffected allies of the Athenians, as from the Boeotians and other allies of Sparta. He seems to have remained at Decelea until the end of the Peloponnesian War. In 411 BC, during the administration of the Four Hundred, he made an unsuccessful attempt on Athens itself. Afterwards the focus of the Peloponnesian War shifted to Asia Minor, and Lysander assumed a greater role in the siege of Athens. After victory was secured, Agis voted to charge his Agiad co-monarch Pausanias with treason, but Pausanias was acquitted.

In 401 BC, the command of the war against the notoriously disloyal Elis was entrusted to Agis, who in the third year compelled the Eleans to sue for peace, acknowledge the freedom of their Perioeci (Triphylians and others), and allow Spartans to take part in the Olympic Games and sacrifices. As he was returning from Delphi, where he had gone to consecrate a tenth of the spoil, he fell sick at Heraea in Arcadia, and died a few days after he reached Sparta. He was buried in Sparta, with unparalleled solemnity and pomp.

Agis left a son, Leotychides. However, he was excluded from the throne, as there was some suspicion with regard to his legitimacy. A common legend states that while Alcibiades was in Sparta, Agis II suspected that Alcibiades had slept with his queen, Timaea (and that Alcibiades had fathered Leotychides). It was probably at the suggestion of Agis that orders were sent out to Astyochus to put him to death. Alcibiades, however, received warning (according to some accounts from Timaea herself), and evaded the Spartans. However, others claim that, judging from the sources, Leotychides was a man at the time of Agis&#x27; death, and Alcibiades as his father was a later replacement for a now unknown lover.

<doc id="625352" wikidata="Q1068048" url="?curid=625352" title="3412 Kafka">
<text>3412 Kafka, provisional designation , is an asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 6 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 10 January 1983, by American astronomers Randolph Kirk and Donald Rudy at Palomar Observatory in California, United States. The asteroid was named after writer Franz Kafka.

== Orbit and classification ==

Kafka orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,212 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as at the Finnish Turku Observatory in 1942, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by 41 years prior to its official discovery observation at Palomar.

== Physical characteristics ==

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Kafka measures 6.1 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.231. Kafka is a superslow rotator. Its rotation period of 2,766 hours (about 115 days) is among the longest of any known asteroid.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Franz Kafka (1883–1924), Austrian–Czech writer of novels and short stories, in which protagonists are faced with bizarre or surrealistic situations. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 13 February 1987 ().

<text>The East Siberian Sea (; ) is a marginal sea in the Arctic Ocean. It is located between the Arctic Cape to the north, the coast of Siberia to the south, the New Siberian Islands to the west and Cape Billings, close to Chukotka, and Wrangel Island to the east. This sea borders on the Laptev Sea to the west and the Chukchi Sea to the east.

This sea is one of the least studied in the Arctic area. It is characterized by severe climate, low water salinity, and a scarcity of flora, fauna and human population, as well as shallow depths (mostly less than 50 m), slow sea currents, low tides (below 25 cm), frequent fogs, especially in summer, and an abundance of ice fields which fully melt only in August–September. The sea shores were inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous tribes of Yukaghirs, Chukchi and then Evens and Evenks, which were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry. They were then absorbed by Yakuts and later by Russians.

Major industrial activities in the area are mining and navigation within the Northern Sea Route; commercial fishing is poorly developed. The largest city and port is Pevek, the northernmost city of mainland Russia.

==Name==
The present name was assigned to the sea on 27 June 1935 by Decree of the Soviet Government. Before that, the sea had no distinct name, and a variety of names were interchangeably used to refer to it in Russia, including &quot;Indigirskoe&quot;, &quot;Kolymskoe&quot;, &quot;Severnoe&quot; (Northern), &quot;Sibirskoe&quot; and &quot;Ledovitoe&quot; (Icy).

==Geography==

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the East Siberian Sea as follows:

&quot;On the West.&quot; The Eastern limit of Laptev Sea [From the Northern extremity of Kotelni Island – through Kotelni Island to Cape Madvejyi. Then through Malyi Island, to Cape Vaguin on Great Liakhov Island. Thence to Cape Sviaroy Noss on the main land].

&quot;On the North.&quot; A line from the Northernmost point of Wrangel Island (179°30&#x27;W) to the Northern sides of the De Long Islands (including Henrietta and Jeannette Islands) and Bennett Island, thence to the Northern extremity of Kotelni Island.

&quot;On the East.&quot; From the Northernmost point of Wrangel Island through this island to Cape Blossom thence to Cape Yakan on the main land (176°40&#x27;E).
===Topography===
Because it is open towards the Arctic Ocean in the north, the main gulfs of the East Siberian Sea, like the Kolyma Bay, the Kolyma Gulf and the Chaunskaya Bay, are all located in its southern limits. There are no islands in the middle of the East Siberian Sea, but there are a few islands and island groups in its coastal waters, like Ayon Island and the Medvyezhi island group. The total area of the islands is only 80 km2. Some islands mostly consist of sand and ice and gradually erode.

The total catchment area is 1,342,000 km2. Among the rivers flowing into the East Siberian Sea, the Indigirka, Alazeya, Chukochya, Kolyma, Rauchua, Chaun, and Pegtymel are the most important. Only a few rivers are navigable. The coastline of the sea is 3,016 km long. It makes large bends, sometimes stretching deep into the land, and has a rather different topography in the eastern and western parts. Fine bends are rare and occur only in the river deltas. The coastal section between the New Siberian Islands and the mouth of the Kolyma River is uniform, with low and slowly varying slopes. It extends landwards to the marshy tundra filled with numerous small lakes. In contrast, the coast to the east of the Kolyma River is mountainous, with steep cliffs.

The underwater topography of the shelf that forms the seabed is a plain, sloping from southwest to northeast, covered in a mixture of silt, sand and stones and lacking significant depressions and elevations. About 70% of the sea is shallower than 50 m, with predominant depths of 20–25 m. North-east to the mouth of the Kolyma and Indigirka rivers, there are deep trenches on the seabed, which are attributed to the ancient river valleys, now submerged by the sea. The region of small depths in the western part forms the Novosibirsk shoal. The greatest depths of about 915 m are found in the north-eastern part of the sea.

The East Siberian Sea is bound to the south by the East Siberian Lowland, an alluvial plain mainly composed of sediments of marine origin dating back to the time when the whole area was occupied by the Verkhoyansk Sea, an ancient sea at the edge of the Siberian Craton in the Permian period. As centuries went by, gradually, most of the area limiting the sea, as well as the contiguous Laptev Sea to the south became filled with the alluvial deposits of modern rivers.

===Climate===
The climate is polar and is influenced by the continent and Atlantic and Pacific oceans. In winter, it is mostly affected by the continent. South-westerly and southerly winds having the speeds of 6–7 m/s (15 mph, 25 km/h) bring cold air from Siberia, so the average temperature in January is approximately −30 °C. The weather is calm, clear and stable with occasional intrusions by cyclones. Atlantic cyclones increase the wind speed and air temperature whereas Pacific ones bring clouds, storms and blizzards.

The winds blow from the north in summer; they are weak in June, strengthen to 6–7 m/s (15 mph, 25 km/h) in July and reach 10–15 m/s (33 mph, 50 km/h) in August, making the western part of the sea one of the most violent areas on the northern Russian coast. The southeastern part is however much calmer. Northerly winds result in the low average temperatures of 0–1 °C in the open sea and 2–3 °C on the coast in July. Skies are usually cloudy, with frequent drizzling rains or wet snow. Along the coasts, fogs occur 90–100 days per year, mostly in summer (68–75 days). Precipitation is low at 100–200 mm per year, but it is still larger than the evaporation volume.

===Hydrology===
The continental runoff into the East Siberian Sea is relatively small at about 250 km3/year that makes only 10% of the total runoff in all the Arctic seas of Russia. The largest contribution is from the Kolyma River at 132 km3, followed by the Indigirka River at 59 km3. Most runoff (90%) occurs in summer; it is concentrated near the coast, owing to the weak river currents, and therefore does not significantly affect the sea hydrology. The water exchange between the neighboring seas is as follows. The annual outflow to the Laptev Sea, Chukchi Sea and Arctic Ocean is 3,240, 6,600 and 11,430 km3, respectively; while the respective inflow values are 3,240, 8,800 and 9,230 km3.

The surface water temperature decreases from south to north. In winter it varies between −0.2 and 0.6 °C at the river deltas and from −1.7 to −1.8 °C in the northern sea part. In summer, it warms to 7–8 °C in the bays and inlets and to 2–3 °C in the ice-free sea zones.

Surface water salinity increases from southwest to northeast. In winter and spring, it is 4–5‰ (parts per thousand) near the deltas of the Kolyma and Indigirka rivers. It increases to 28–30‰ in the sea centre, reaching 31–32‰ at its northern outskirts. Salinity decreases in summer by some 5‰ due to the snow melting. It also decreases by some 5–7‰ from the sea bottom to the surface.

There are constant currents at the sea surface directed from west to east. They are weak and thus can temporarily change direction due to the wind. The tides are semidiurnal (rising twice a day) with the amplitude between 5 and 25 cm. The tidal wave weakens toward the coast due to shallow waters. The sea level is maximal in summer, due to the river runoff, and in autumn due to the winds. It is the lowest in March–April, with the total annual fluctuations within about 70 cm. Winds bring storms with waves reaching 3–5 m in the western part whereas the eastern regions are relatively calm. The storms typically last 1–2 days in summer; they are more frequent in winter and may extend up to 3–5 days.

The sea freezes over between October–November and June–July. The ice is continuous and stationary near the coast, reaching the thickness of 2 m by the end of winter; The thickness decreases from west to east. Further into the sea, the ice cover transforms into drifting ice having the thickness of 2–3 m. The southern winter winds shift this ice northwards, making polynyas near the sea centre. There are no icebergs in the sea. Ice melting typically starts around May, first around the delta of the major Kolyma River.

In absence of industry, sea water is rather clean. Minor contaminations are found near the Novosibirsk and Wrangel islands (up to 80 μg/L), due to occasional oil spills, and in Chaunskaya Bay due to the local thermal power station and activities at the major port Pevek.

==Flora and fauna==
Flora and fauna are relatively scarce due to the harsh climate. The summer plankton bloom is short but intense, producing 5 million tonnes of plankton in August and September, whereas the annual production is 7 million tonnes. The nutrients in water are mostly provided by river discharges and coastal erosion. The plankton species are dominated by the Pacific species of copepods.

The sea shores and icefields host ringed seals (&quot;Phoca hispida&quot;), bearded seals (&quot;Erignathus barbatus&quot;) and walruses (&quot;Odobenus rosmarus&quot;) along with their predator, polar bear (&quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;). Birds include seagulls, uria and cormorants. Sea waters are often visited by bowhead whale (&quot;Balaena mysticetus&quot;), gray whale (&quot;Eschrichtius robustus&quot;), beluga (&quot;Delphinapterus leucas&quot;) and narwhal (&quot;Monodon monoceros&quot;). Major fish species are grayling and &quot;Coregonus&quot; (whitefishes), such as muksun (&quot;Coregonus muksun&quot;), broad whitefish (&quot;Coregonus nasus&quot;) and omul (&quot;Coregonus autumnalis&quot;). Also common are polar smelt, saffron cod, polar cod, flounder and Arctic char.

==History==
The coast of the East Siberian Sea was inhabited for ages by the native peoples of northern Siberia such as Yukaghirs and Chukchi (eastern areas). Those tribes were engaged in fishing, hunting and reindeer husbandry, as reindeer sleds were essential for transportation and hunting. They were joined and absorbed by Evens and Evenks around the second century and later, between ninth and 15th centuries, by much more numerous Yakuts. All those tribes moved north from the Baikal Lake area avoiding confrontations with Mongols. Whereas they all practised shamanism, they spoke different languages.

The sea was navigated by Russian sea-farers, moving from one river mouth to another in their kochs as early as the 17th century. In 1648, Semyon Dezhnev and Fedot Alekseev sailed the coast of the East Siberian Sea from the Kolyma to river Anadyr in the Bering Sea. Systematic exploration and mapping of the sea and its coasts was carried out by a series of expeditions in 1735–42, 1820–24, 1822, 1909 and 1911–14.

In the 1930s, the coastal settlement of Ambarchik, located at the delta of the Kolyma River, was used as a transient labor camp from which prisoners were transported to other northern camps of the Gulag system. While stationed at Ambarchik, prisoners were employed to build most of the port infrastructure and to unload the incoming ships. Later, due to shallow waters, the shipping was gradually transferred to Chersky in the lower reaches of the Kolyma, in order to accommodate larger vessels. As a result of this transfer, the port and settlement have been abandoned. Nowadays, Ambarchik only hosts a meteorological station operated by a few staff members.

Another two labour camps of the Gulag system were later opened near Pevek, namely Chaunlag (1951–1953) and Chaunchukotlag (1949–1957). Both contained about 10,000 inmates used in the mine and construction works.

==Human activities==

The southern coast of the sea is shared by the Sakha Republic on the west and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of Russia on the east. The coastal settlements are few and small, with the typical population below 100. The only city is Pevek (population 5,206), which is the northernmost city in Russia. There are gold mines near Leningradsky and Pevek, but many mines have been closed recently, for example, tin mines at Pevek in the 1990s, that resulted in outflow of population. So, the Logashkino settlement, which used to be a notable East Siberian Sea port, was abolished in 1998.

The sea is used mostly for transportation of goods across the northern coast of Russia during August–September. The navigation is hindered even in summer by the remaining floating ice which is also brought down to the southern shores by occasional winds. Fishery and hunting of marine animals is still practised as traditional activities, but has only local importance. Fishery mostly targets salmon, halibut and crab. Data exist on fish production, which in 2005 was distributed, in thousand tonnes as follows: sardine (1.6), Arctic cisco (1.8), Bering cisco (2.2), broad whitefish (2.7), Muksun (2.8) and others (3.6).

The principal port is Pevek (in the Chaunskaya Bay) After the breakup of the Soviet Union, commercial navigation in the Arctic went into decline. Nowadays more or less regular shipping occurs only between Pevek and Vladivostok. Ports in the northern Siberian coast located between Dudinka and Pevek see next to no shipping at all.

Since 1944, most electricity for the region is provided by the 30 MW thermal power station of Pevek. It is ageing and consumes much oil which has to be brought from far away. Therefore, there was a project to replace the station by a floating 70 MW atomic power station by 2015. (failed)

<text>&quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; is a song by American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, released on their debut studio album, &quot;Appetite for Destruction&quot; (1987). In the United States, the song was released in June 1988, topping the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and becoming the band&#x27;s only US number-one single. In the United Kingdom, the song was released on August 8, 1988, reaching number 24 on the UK Singles Chart the same month. Re-released there in May 1989, it peaked at number six.

== Background and composition ==
During a jam session at the band&#x27;s house in Sunset Strip, drummer Steven Adler and Slash were warming up and Slash began to play a &quot;circus&quot; melody while making faces at Adler. Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin asked Slash to play it again. Stradlin came up with some chords, Duff McKagan created a bassline and Adler planned a beat. In his autobiography, Slash said &quot;within an hour my guitar exercise had become something else.&quot; Lead singer Axl Rose was listening to the musicians upstairs in his room and was inspired to write lyrics, which he completed by the following afternoon. He based it on his girlfriend Erin Everly (daughter of Don Everly, of the Everly Brothers, and Venetia Stevenson), and declared that Lynyrd Skynyrd served as an inspiration &quot;to make sure that we&#x27;d got that heartfelt feeling.&quot; On the next composing session in Burbank, the band added a bridge and a guitar solo.

When the band recorded demos with producer Spencer Proffer, he suggested adding a breakdown at the song&#x27;s end. The musicians agreed, but were not sure what to do. Listening to the demo in a loop, Rose started saying to himself, &quot;Where do we go? Where do we go now?&quot; and Proffer suggested that he sing that.
An alternate version featuring half a live version, half a newly recorded 1999 version plays during the credits of the movie &quot;Big Daddy.&quot;

== Music video ==
A music video was made for the song in 1987. The music video depicts the band rehearsing in Mendiola&#x27;s Ballroom at Huntington Park, California, surrounded by crew members. All of the band members&#x27; girlfriends at the time were shown in the clip: Rose&#x27;s girlfriend Erin Everly; McKagan&#x27;s girlfriend Mandy Brix, from the all-female rock band the Lame Flames; Stradlin&#x27;s girlfriend Angela Nicoletti; Adler&#x27;s girlfriend Cheryl Swiderski; and Slash&#x27;s girlfriend Sally McLaughlin. Stradlin&#x27;s dog was also shown. The video was successful on MTV, and helped launch the song to mainstream success.

To make &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; more marketable to MTV and radio stations, the song was edited down from 5:56 to 4:58, for the radio edit/remix, with much of Slash&#x27;s guitar solo removed. This drew the ire of the band, including Rose, who commented on it in a 1989 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;I hate the edit of &#x27;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine.&#x27; Radio stations said, &#x27;Well, your vocals aren&#x27;t cut.&#x27; My favorite part of the song is Slash&#x27;s slow solo; it&#x27;s the heaviest part for me. There&#x27;s no reason for it to be missing except to create more space for commercials, so the radio-station owners can get more advertising dollars. When you get the chopped version of &#x27;Paradise City&#x27; or half of &#x27;Sweet Child&#x27; and &#x27;Patience&#x27; cut, you&#x27;re getting screwed.&quot;

A 7-inch vinyl format and cassette single were released. The album version of the song was included on the US single release, while the UK single was the &quot;edit/remix&quot; version. The 12-inch vinyl format also contained the longer LP version. The B-side to the single is a non-album, live version of &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy.”

On an interview on Eddie Trunk&#x27;s New York radio show in May 2006, Rose stated that his original concept for the video focused on the theme of drug trafficking. According to Rose, the video was to depict an Asian woman carrying a baby into a foreign land, only to discover at the end that the child was dead and filled with heroin. This concept was rejected by Geffen Records.

This song was used for a teaser trailer premiere of &quot;,&quot; which released on April 18, 2022, and the film itself, including the end credits. As of 2024, the music video currently has over 1.6 billion views on YouTube.

== Reception ==
&quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; placed number 37 on &quot;Guitar World&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos.&quot; It also came in at number three on &quot;Blender&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born, and at number 196 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2004 and 88th in the 2021 list.

In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed it at number six in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. On a 2004 &quot;Total Guitar&quot; magazine poll, the introduction&#x27;s famous riff was voted the number one riff of all-time by the readers of the magazine. It was also in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 40 Greatest Songs that Changed the World. It places number seven in VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;80s,” and placed number 210 on the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) Songs of the Century list.

The song has sold 2,609,000 digital copies in the United States as of March 2012. In 2017, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number 10 on their list of the 15 greatest Guns N&#x27; Roses songs, and in 2020, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number eight on their list of the 20 greatest Guns N&#x27; Roses songs.

Guitarist Slash said in 1990, &quot;[The song] turned into a huge hit and now it makes me sick. I mean, I like it, but I hate what it represents.&quot;

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called it a &quot;medium tempo rocker by the new hero&#x27;s [&quot;sic&quot;] of metal, featuring a nice breakdown&quot; and &quot;standout guitar playing.&quot;

== Australian Crawl controversy ==
In 2015, the web page of the Australian music TV channel MAX published an article by music writer Nathan Jolly that noted similarities between &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; and the song &quot;Unpublished Critics&quot; by the Australian band Australian Crawl, from 1981. The article included both songs, inviting readers to compare the two. It also cited a reader&#x27;s comment on an earlier article that had originally drawn attention to the similarities between the songs. As of May 2015, this comment no longer appeared on the earlier article. The story went viral quickly, encouraging several comments on both the MAX article and the suggestion that &quot;Unpublished Critics&quot; had influenced &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine,” including one from Duff McKagan, bass player with Guns N&#x27; Roses when &quot;Sweet Child o&#x27; Mine&quot; was written and recorded. McKagan found the similarities between the songs &quot;stunning,&quot; but said he had not previously heard &quot;Unpublished Critics.&quot;

== Uses in media ==
The song has been used in numerous films and series, most recently in the 2025 series finale of &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;. Other films and series include:
* &quot;The Wrestler&quot; (2008)
* &quot;Step Brothers&quot; (2008) 
* &quot;The Big Short&quot; (2015)
* &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; (2016)
* &quot;&quot; (2022) 
Slash performs his guitar solo as a guitarist auditioning for a band in a Capital One commercial in which the theme is &quot;easiest decision in the history of decisions.”

The song is used in a 2024 commercial for Spectrum cable service.

<text>Sylvius Leopold Weiss (12 October 168716 October 1750) was a German composer and lutenist.

Born in Grottkau near Breslau, the son of Johann Jacob Weiss, also a lutenist, Weiss was one of the most important and most prolific composers of lute music in history and one of the best-known and most technically accomplished lutenists of his day. 

In later life, Weiss became a friend of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and met J.S. Bach through him. Bach and Weiss were said to have competed in improvisation. 

== Life ==
Born in Grottkau near Breslau, the son of Johann Jacob Weiss, also a lutenist, he served at courts in Breslau, Rome, and Dresden, where he died. Until recently, he was thought to have been born in 1686, but recent evidence suggests that he was in fact born the following year.

Weiss was one of the most important and most prolific composers of lute music in history and one of the best-known and most technically accomplished lutenists of his day. He was a teacher to Philip Hyacinth, 4th Prince Lobkowicz, and the prince&#x27;s second wife Anna Wilhelmina Althan.

In later life, Weiss became a friend of Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and met J.S. Bach through him. Bach and Weiss were said to have competed in improvisation, as the following account by Johann Friedrich Reichardt describes:

&quot;Anyone who knows how difficult it is to play harmonic modulations and good counterpoint on the lute will be surprised and full of disbelief to hear from eyewitnesses that Weiss, the great lutenist, challenged J.S. Bach, the great harpsichordist and organist, at playing fantasies and fugues.&quot;

Sylvius Weiss&#x27;s son Johann Adolph Faustinus Weiss succeeded him as a Saxon court lutenist.

Weiss is buried at the Old Catholic Cemetery in Dresden, Saxony, Germany.

==Works==
Weiss probably wrote more than 1000 pieces for lute, from which about 850 attributed pieces survived, most of them grouped into &#x27;sonatas&#x27; (not to be confused with the later classical sonata, based on sonata form) or suites, which consist mostly of baroque dance pieces. Weiss also wrote chamber pieces and concertos, but only the solo parts have survived for most of them.

His Sonatas 15 and 48 were the inspiration for the painting &quot;The Fruit of the Soul II&quot; by Anelia Pavlova.

<text>Robert David Keane (born 8 July 1980) is an Irish professional football coach and former player who played as a striker and is currently the head coach of Ferencváros. Keane served as captain of the Republic of Ireland from March 2006 until his international retirement in August 2016. Keane is the most capped player and all-time top goalscorer for his nation.

Keane began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, scoring twice on his first-team debut aged 17. The following season, he was the club&#x27;s leading goalscorer and scored his first international goal for Ireland. He changed club frequently between 1999 and 2002, breaking transfer fee records, but his brief spells at Inter Milan and Leeds United were unexceptional. He joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2002 and played there for seven and a half years over two spells, amassing 306 appearances and 122 goals across all competitions. The 2007–08 season was the most fruitful of his career as he set a career record of 23 goals in a season, including a landmark 100th competitive goal, and won his first senior honour (the League Cup).

Keane moved to Liverpool in July 2008 but he spent only six months at the club before returning to Tottenham, where he was made first team captain. In January 2010, he moved on loan to Scottish Premier League side Celtic for the rest of the season, and spent the second half of the following season loaned to West Ham United. He left Tottenham for LA Galaxy in 2011, and in January 2012 went to Aston Villa on a two-month loan during the Major League Soccer (MLS) off-season. He departed LA Galaxy in 2016 having scored 104 goals across six seasons, before a short stint with Indian club ATK. Keane announced his retirement from professional football in November 2018. In total, he scored 126 Premier League goals for six different clubs, which ranks him as the 17th-most successful goalscorer in the history of the Premier League.

Widely regarded as one of the best Irish players of all time, Keane scored 68 goals for the Republic of Ireland national team over an 18-year international career, making him the all-time record Irish scorer. His 146 caps is also an Irish record. Keane is the joint fifth-highest European international goalscorer of all time, and the only player in the history of world football to have scored at least one international goal in 19 consecutive years. Keane was the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s top scorer at the 2002 FIFA World Cup with three goals as they reached the last 16, and also played at UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016. Throughout his club and international career he was known for his goal celebration where he performed a cartwheel followed by a forward roll.

After announcing his retirement from playing, Keane began his coaching career with the Ireland senior team as assistant manager under Mick McCarthy&#x27;s management setup in November 2018. He also took on the role of assistant manager at Championship club Middlesbrough in 2019, with his former teammate Jonathan Woodgate as manager. He left both roles in 2020. He became the head coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv in June 2023, winning the Israeli Premier League and Toto Cup in his only season.

==Early life==
Robert David Keane was born and raised in Tallaght, Dublin, the son of Anne and Robert Keane. He started his football career with local club Fettercairn before joining Dublin schoolboy team Crumlin United at the age of 10, where his talent was seen and recognised at an early age. He also played Gaelic football until he was 15, before giving it up to pursue a football career. Keane received offers from both Liverpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but decided to go to the First Division side, judging that it would be harder to break into the first team at Liverpool. He moved to Wolverhampton four days before his 16th birthday in July 1996, joining their youth team.

==Club career==

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Keane progressed through Wolves&#x27; youth ranks and made his professional debut aged 17 on 9 August 1997, scoring twice against Norwich City. The following season he excelled at the club, earning praise from both the press and Wolves manager Colin Lee. He went on to be the club&#x27;s leading scorer, with 16 goals in the 1998–99 season. Keane&#x27;s performances and goalscoring record with both Wolves and his national team attracted much interest from larger clubs and a move for the young striker seemed imminent given Wolves&#x27; finances. However, with three years left on his contract, Wolves sought a high price for their Irish star and managing director John Richards stated his reluctance to sell Keane unless their asking price was met.

===Coventry City===
Just weeks into the 1999–2000 season, he was sold to Premier League club Coventry City for £6 million, then a British record for a teenager. Keane got off to a great start, scoring two goals on his debut against Derby County. During a successful season at Coventry, he played a major role in a stylish attacking side boasting the likes of Gary McAllister, Mustapha Hadji and Youssef Chippo and formed a productive strike partnership with Cédric Roussel. Keane played in a total of 34 games, scoring 12 goals, all of which came in the Premier League.

===Inter Milan===
After an impressive first season in the Premier League, Keane was signed by Italian Serie A club Inter Milan for a fee of £13 million in July 2000, signing a five-year contract. However, Keane&#x27;s dream move to Italy soon soured when manager Marcello Lippi was sacked. Lippi&#x27;s successor, Marco Tardelli, deemed Keane to be surplus to requirements and in December 2000, he was loaned out to Leeds United. Keane made 14 appearances for Inter in all competitions scoring three goals, his most memorable coming two minutes into the Supercoppa Italiana match against Lazio. He also scored against Ruch Chorzów in the UEFA Cup and Lecce in the Coppa Italia.

===Leeds United===
His Leeds career got off to an impressive start, scoring nine goals in 14 starts for the club before the Leeds manager, David O&#x27;Leary, made his loan deal permanent in May 2001 at an original cost of £12 million. The following season was not so bright, and he found himself dropping down the pecking order. His form suffered and he managed only nine goals in 33 appearances, three of them in a 6–0 League Cup win at Leicester City on 9 October 2001.

Meanwhile, Leeds sunk deeper into debt and were forced to sell many players, with Keane joining the exodus when he was sold to Tottenham Hotspur just before the 2002–03 transfer deadline for a fee of £7 million.

===Tottenham Hotspur===

====2002–2005====

On signing him for Tottenham, manager Glenn Hoddle said that Keane was ideally suited to Tottenham and could make White Hart Lane his &quot;spiritual home&quot; for years to come. Keane had an impressive debut at Spurs, winning a penalty during a 3–2 win over West Ham United. Keane&#x27;s first goal for Tottenham came in a 2–1 win against Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. Although Spurs finished in a disappointing tenth place, Keane was their success story of the season, finishing as Tottenham&#x27;s top scorer with 13 goals, including a spectacular hat-trick in a win over Everton at White Hart Lane.

In the 2003–04 season, Spurs battled with relegation, but Keane&#x27;s goals played a major part in helping secure Tottenham&#x27;s Premier League status. A hat-trick against Wolves, and a last-minute penalty to equalise in the North London derby against Arsenal, despite Arsenal winning the Premier League at Tottenham, were highlights as Keane once again ended the season as Tottenham&#x27;s top scorer with 16 goals, 14 in the league.

His third season, 2004–05, was more frustrating. Despite finishing with his highest return of goals in a season for Spurs, 17, he played second-fiddle to the likes of Jermain Defoe, Frédéric Kanouté and Mido for much of the season. The frustration culminated in Keane storming from the dugout towards the end of a game against Birmingham City in April 2005 after all the substitutes had been used, meaning he would not get a chance to appear. He was fined £10,000 and forced to train with the reserves after the outburst and his future at the club was thrown into doubt.

The 2005–06 season started as the previous one had ended, with Defoe being preferred to partner Mido in Tottenham&#x27;s strikeforce. However, Defoe&#x27;s strike-rate continued to disappoint and Keane&#x27;s persistence paid off in November when manager Martin Jol eventually gave Keane a chance to replace Defoe and stake his claim. By March, he had overtaken Mido as the top goalscorer at the club. Keane went on to finish the season with 16 league goals — making him the Premier League&#x27;s joint fourth-highest goalscorer that season. He had also been made the vice-captain, taking the captaincy on occasions when Ledley King was not available. Keane was involved in a training ground fight with teammate Edgar Davids in December 2005, but the pair subsequently made up publicly and were seen encouraging each other on the pitch.

====2006–2008====
In February 2006, Inter&#x27;s owner and president, Massimo Moratti, admitted his regret at letting Keane go after being impressed by his performances at Tottenham. Keane extended his commitment to Tottenham, signing a new four-year contract in March 2006. Keane was named as one of ten Spurs squad members to be struck down by norovirus on 6 May 2006. However, he still managed to play in their final game of the season against West Ham United.

Keane had a slow start to the 2006–07 season which was further set back by a knee ligament injury that Keane suffered against Middlesbrough on 5 December 2006. His coming back from injury marked the beginning of a return to form and a dynamic partnership with Dimitar Berbatov. Keane and Berbatov were jointly awarded the Premier League&#x27;s Player of the Month Award for April 2007. Keane finished the season with a total of 22 goals in all competitions — the highest-ever season tally of his career — scoring 15 goals in his last 15 appearances of the season.

Keane made his 200th appearance for Tottenham in the final game of the 2006–07 season against Manchester City scoring the first goal in a 2–1 victory that saw Tottenham secure fifth place in the league.

He signed a new five-year contract with Tottenham on 28 May 2007. On 26 December 2007, he became the thirteenth player in the history of the league to score 100 Premier League goals. 2007 proved to be a remarkable year for the striker with a total of 31 goals and 13 assists from just 40 starts. His tally of 19 league goals in the calendar year was the highest of any player in the Premier League throughout 2007.

He scored his 100th competitive goal for Tottenham in the 2–0 win against Sunderland on 19 January 2008, becoming the fifteenth Tottenham player to achieve this feat. On 24 February 2008, he won his first senior honour as a player as his Tottenham side won the first League Cup Final to be played at the new Wembley Stadium, beating Chelsea 2–1 after extra time. On 12 April 2008, Keane made his 250th appearance for Spurs in the 1–1 draw with Middlesbrough. Keane finished the 2007–08 season equal top scorer for Spurs with Berbatov, with 23 goals in all competitions. His 15 Premier League goals making him the first Spurs player to score double figures in the Premier League in 6 consecutive seasons. Keane won Player of the Year three times during his Tottenham career (2003, 2005–06 and 2007–08); the first player to do so.

His consistency and strike-rate attracted the attention of Premier League rivals Liverpool. Despite initial resistance to the sale and accusations of misconduct, Tottenham agreed to a £20.3 million deal for the player.

===Liverpool===
Liverpool publicly announced their interest in Keane on 1 July 2008.
Amid accusations that Liverpool had unsettled the player, Tottenham Hotspur filed a complaint to the Premier League regarding the club&#x27;s conduct.
However, on 28 July 2008, Tottenham confirmed the sale of Keane for £19 million (plus a potential £1.3 million in performance based compensation). Keane agreed terms with Liverpool shortly afterwards, signing a four-year contract with the Merseyside club. Upon his arrival to Liverpool, Keane said, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a Liverpool fan all my life, going back to when I was a kid growing up in Dublin, and I always had a Liverpool shirt on my back. So, to be here now as a Liverpool player is incredible and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&quot; Following the transfer, Tottenham withdrew their official complaint against Liverpool after the club made a donation to the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation and apologised for their behaviour prior to the deal. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy publicly stated his dissatisfaction, saying he had been forced into transferring the player due to Liverpool&#x27;s interference.

Keane was given the squad number 7, and scored his first goal for Liverpool on 1 October 2008 in a Champions League win against PSV Eindhoven at Anfield. A second Champions League goal quickly followed with Keane scoring the opening goal in Liverpool&#x27;s 1–1 draw with Atlético Madrid. Premier League goals were less forthcoming but he scored twice for Liverpool against West Bromwich Albion on 8 November.

Six weeks passed before Keane scored again but it was a crucial equaliser against Arsenal, giving Liverpool a 1–1 away draw against their league rivals. In the following Premier League match against Bolton, Keane scored two more league goals to seal a 3–0 win for Liverpool. Despite this he failed to establish himself as a first team regular and when he did play was often played out of position. During the January transfer window, Tottenham Hotspur made an approach for the striker and Liverpool accepted the offer, allowing the Irishman to return to his former club for a fee of £12 million, £7 million less than Liverpool had paid for him.

===Return to Tottenham Hotspur===
Keane rejoined Tottenham on 2 February 2009, signing for a basic fee of £12 million, potentially rising to £16 million with add-ons. The deal meant that the cumulative transfer fees paid for Keane over his career amounted to around £75 million.
He signed a four-year contract with the north London club. Keane was one of three players to make returns to Tottenham during the transfer window, along with Jermain Defoe and Pascal Chimbonda. He was also made Tottenham vice-captain a week later, after often deputising for Ledley King during his first spell there. He was cup-tied for Spurs&#x27; appearance in the 2009 Football League Cup Final. Keane scored his first goal since his return to the club on 4 March, opening the scoring in the crucial 4–0 home victory against Middlesbrough. He followed this up by scoring another vital goal, this time a last-minute equaliser, away to Sunderland in a 1–1 draw on 7 March.

Soon after Keane&#x27;s return to White Hart Lane, railway service Virgin Trains ran an advertisement with the slogan &quot;A Liverpool to London return faster than Robbie Keane.&quot; On his return to Liverpool on the final day of the season, he scored in a 3–1 defeat. He received a generally warm reception from the fans despite scoring against them.

On 31 July 2009, Keane captained Tottenham to winning the Premier League Asia Trophy in a pre-season competition in China. He scored twice in the 3–0 win over Hull City inside Beijing Workers Stadium. On 26 September 2009, Keane scored four goals in a 5–0 win over Burnley. During Tottenham&#x27;s League Cup Fourth round match, Keane scored one of two goals against Everton on 27 October 2009 at White Hart Lane. He continued his scoring form with another against Sunderland in their 2–0 home win on 7 November 2009.

====Loan to Celtic====
On 1 February 2010, Keane signed for Celtic in a loan deal until the end of the 2009–10 season and was assigned the number 7 shirt, previously worn by Jimmy Johnstone and Henrik Larsson. After signing for Celtic, Keane said: &quot;The club is massive. I am a Celtic fan and did not have to ask much about it. I always wanted to play for Celtic and it works for all parties.&quot;

He made his Celtic debut in a 1–0 defeat on 2 February at Rugby Park against Kilmarnock. He scored his first goal for Celtic in a 4–2 victory in the fifth round of the Scottish Cup against Dunfermline at East End Park. He scored his first goal in the SPL against Aberdeen in a 4–4 draw on 13 February. His first goal at Celtic Park proved to be the winner against Dundee United on 20 February. Keane&#x27;s first Old Firm match against Rangers was on 28 February, with Celtic losing 1–0. On 13 March, Keane scored his first Celtic hat-trick in a 3–0 Scottish Cup win over Kilmarnock, and then scored two in a league clash against them two weeks later.

Keane&#x27;s penultimate match was a 2–1 Old Firm win over Rangers on 4 May his last match for Celtic came against Hearts on 9 May, he scored the first goal in a 2–1 victory. He stated that he enjoyed his time at Celtic and that it had given him back his &#x27;hunger for football&#x27;.
On 12 April, Keane was announced as SPL Player of the Month for March 2010. On 19 April 2010, Keane was announced as Celtic&#x27;s Fans&#x27; Player of the Year.

====Loan to West Ham United====
On 30 January 2011, Keane joined West Ham United on loan for the remainder of the season. Keane made his debut for West Ham on 2 February in a 3–1 victory over Blackpool at Bloomfield Road, scoring his first goal in the process. West Ham had an option to extend the deal by two years if they avoided relegation from the Premier League. However, in May 2011 West Ham were relegated and Keane returned to Tottenham.

===LA Galaxy===

====2011====
After playing for the newly reformed New York Cosmos in Paul Scholes&#x27;s testimonial match, Keane joined LA Galaxy of MLS, becoming one of the club&#x27;s three allowed designated players, alongside David Beckham and Landon Donovan. The Galaxy traded their previous third Designated Player, Juan Pablo Ángel, to city rivals Chivas USA to make room for Keane. He made his debut on 20 August 2011, in a California Clásico game against the San Jose Earthquakes, and scored his first goal for his new team in the 21st minute, in a 2–0 win at The Home Depot Center. On 13 September, he scored his first CONCACAF Champions League goal in a 2–1 group stage loss to Monarcas Morelia of Mexico.

The Galaxy finished the season as Western Conference champions, and won the Supporters&#x27; Shield. On 6 November, in his first full match, Keane scored in a 3–1 win over Real Salt Lake to book a place in the 2011 MLS Cup. Two weeks later, in their home stadium, he assisted Donovan&#x27;s winning goal in the 72nd minute of the final, as the Galaxy defeated Houston Dynamo 1–0.

====Loan to Aston Villa====
On 8 January 2012, Keane agreed to move on loan to Aston Villa for two months, until the new MLS season began in March. He trained with the Villa squad on 9 and 10 January and completed the move on the 12th.

He made his debut at Villa Park in a 1–1 draw with Everton on 14 January, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute for Stephen Warnock. Keane then made his full debut in Villa&#x27;s next match against Wolverhampton Wanderers, in which he scored his first two goals for the club including the winner in a 3–2 victory. On 5 February, he scored the equaliser against Newcastle United, in an eventual 2–1 loss, his third goal for Villa, in four league games.

====Return from loan====
On 18 March 2012, Keane scored twice in a 3–1 home win over D.C. United for the Galaxy&#x27;s first win of the season. In July, with five goals including consecutive braces, he was voted MLS Player of the Month. He finished with 16 regular season goals, fourth in the league&#x27;s top scorers, and was one of three strikers named in the MLS Best XI, alongside Thierry Henry and Chris Wondolowski. His two goals in a 4–2 win over Toronto on 22 September sealed a place in the 2012 MLS Cup Playoffs.
In the Conference Semifinals, Keane scored twice in a 3–1 second leg win over San Jose, as the Galaxy recovered from a 1–0 home loss in the first match. Against Seattle Sounders FC in the Conference Final, he scored another two goals in a 3–0 first leg win, and a late penalty in a 2–1 loss in the second leg at CenturyLink Field. Keane scored a last-minute penalty to complete a 3–1 win in the 2012 MLS Cup, once again against Houston Dynamo.

At the start of the 2013 season, in the absence of Donovan, Keane was promoted to captain by head coach Bruce Arena. On opening day, he had a part in each goal as Galaxy beat Chicago Fire 4–0 at home, assisting a hat-trick for Mike Magee before himself finding the net in added time. On 26 May, he scored his first MLS hat-trick in a 4–0 rout of Seattle, and he recorded another on 27 August in a 4–2 comeback win over Salt Lake, putting him on 10 goals for the season; he was the league&#x27;s Player of the Month in August.
Keane scored twice in a 5–0 win over Chivas on 6 October, the first and last goals of the victory. For the second consecutive season, he made the MLS Best XI, as recognition for his 16 goals and 11 assists, statistics which put him fourth and third on the respective top scorer lists.

On 6 March 2014, Keane signed a new multi-year contract extension with LA Galaxy. For the third season in a row he reached double figures in goals, scoring his tenth on 20 July in a 2–1 loss at Sporting KC. Keane scored his 50th MLS regular-season goal on 28 September, chipping New York Red Bulls goalkeeper Luis Robles to open a 4–0 victory.

On 3 December 2014, Keane was awarded the MLS Most Valuable Player Award after a season in which he recorded a career high 19 goals and 14 assists in 29 appearances. Four days later, he scored the 111th-minute winner in the 2014 MLS Cup which the Galaxy won 2–1 against the New England Revolution for a record fifth title. Keane was given the MLS Cup MVP award, similar to the Man Of The Match award.

After the announcement that his former Liverpool teammate Steven Gerrard would join the Galaxy in July 2015, Keane confirmed that he would not hand over the captaincy. He scored the second goal of the 2–0 home win over Chicago in their first game of the season on 7 March. On 17 June, Keane scored a hat-trick in the fourth round of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, as the Galaxy won 6–1 against fifth-tier amateurs PSA Elite.
On 5 July, Keane scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win over Toronto. Twelve days later, in Gerrard&#x27;s first match, he scored three goals for the second consecutive game including two penalties with Gerrard also netting in a 5–2 win against San Jose.

On 6 March 2016, Keane scored from the penalty spot in the opening 2016 league fixture; a 4–1 home win against D.C. United. He followed that up with another successful penalty on 19 March in the 3–1 home victory against San Jose. After missing five games with a knee injury, Keane returned on 8 May to face New England Revolution and scored twice in the 4–2 home win.
Keane scored his 80th MLS regular-season goal on 23 July in a 2–1 away win against Portland Timbers with a simple tap-in from close range.
On 11 September, he scored Galaxy&#x27;s fourth goal in their 4–2 home win over Orlando City SC. He scored twice in a 4–2 home defeat against Seattle Sounders on 25 September for his ninth and tenth goals of the season.
In November, Keane stated that he would be leaving LA Galaxy after his contract expired at the end of the season, but that he would not be retiring. In total, he scored 104 goals in 165 appearances during his six seasons with the club with his last game being the MLS Cup Playoff penalty-shootout defeat to Colorado Rapids on 6 November 2016.

===ATK===
On 4 August 2017, Keane signed for Indian Super League team ATK joining former teammate Teddy Sheringham, the team&#x27;s head coach. He said that the opportunity to play in a new league appealed to him. He was assigned the number 10 jersey and appointed as the club captain. However, he suffered an achilles injury during a pre-season training camp in Dubai and had to return home for treatment, ruling him out of action until December. Spanish defender Jordi was appointed as the captain in his absence. On 7 December, he made his first-team debut, coming on as a 61st-minute substitute in a 3–2 defeat against Chennaiyin. On 23 December, he scored his first goal in a 1–0 victory against Delhi Dynamos.

Keane was appointed player-manager of ATK in March 2018 after Sheringham and his replacement Ashley Westwood were sacked with ATK finishing outside the play-offs. He scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over NorthEast United on his managerial debut, enough to save them from last place. After contesting the final three matches as player-manager, Keane decided to leave the club at the end of the season and stated he would be taking time out to consider his options. He officially announced his retirement on 28 November 2018.

==International career==


Keane was part of the so-called &quot;golden generation&quot; of Irish youth football of the late 1990s.

Under the guidance of Brian Kerr, the unfancied Republic of Ireland won the UEFA U16 and U18 European championships in 1998, and Keane was part of the victorious U18 side in Cyprus. In 1999, he played at the World Youth Cup in Nigeria, where the Republic of Ireland reached the last 16 before going out on penalties to the hosts. His first Republic of Ireland cap came against the Czech Republic in Olomouc in March 1998. He scored his first senior international goals against Malta in October that year.

Keane was selected by Mick McCarthy as part of the Republic of Ireland squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan, scoring three goals in the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s four games. Keane scored an injury-time equaliser against Germany in the group stage match as the Irish surprised many by holding the former champions to a 1–1 draw. This was the first of only three goals which Germany conceded in the tournament (the other two were scored in the final by Brazil&#x27;s Ronaldo). In the Round of 16 match against Spain, he scored a last-minute penalty to force the game into extra-time and a penalty shootout after the Irish had gone a goal down early in the first half, but eventually lost 3–2 on penalties.

Keane became the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s leading goalscorer during a match against the Faroe Islands on 13 October 2004 when he scored his 22nd and 23rd goals. The first of these goals broke Niall Quinn&#x27;s record of 21 goals.

Although the Republic of Ireland failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Keane scored four goals in the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s eight qualifying matches. Following Steve Staunton&#x27;s appointment as Republic of Ireland manager, Keane was appointed captain. In their first game under Staunton, Keane scored the second goal in the 3–0 victory against Sweden at Lansdowne Road, and celebrated the final match at the Lansdowne Road stadium with a hat-trick on his 70th senior international appearance in a 5–0 defeat of San Marino on 15 November 2006. Giovanni Trapattoni, who took over from Staunton, maintained Keane as team captain starting in his first game in charge against Serbia on 24 May 2008 which ended in a 1–1 draw.

As captain, Keane led the team to a second-place finish in the 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign. He scored his 40th international goal against Cyprus, a header in the 83rd minute, which secured a 2–1 win for the Republic of Ireland. Along with Dimitar Berbatov, he topped the scoring chart in the qualifying group with 5 goals in 10 games. His 41st international goal came in the controversial 2010 World Cup play-off with France on 18 November 2009. This was his 26th goal in competitive (non-friendly) internationals.

Keane won his 100th cap against Argentina in a 1–0 friendly defeat on 11 August 2010. This match was also the first international football match at the new Aviva Stadium. He scored his 45th international goal against Russia in October 2010. It was the first time the Republic of Ireland had lost a game in which Keane had scored. Previously, the Republic of Ireland had won 26 and drew 10 of the 36 games in which Keane had scored. He equalled Andy Townsend&#x27;s record for most appearances as Republic of Ireland captain (40) on 26 March 2011 and also scored a goal in the process.

Keane took part in the inaugural Nations Cup for the Republic of Ireland, which took place in February and May 2011. He ended the tournament as top scorer, despite not having played in their first game against Wales. Keane scored three goals in total, two against Northern Ireland in a 5–0 victory, and what proved to be the tournament&#x27;s winning goal in a 1–0 victory over Scotland. The Republic of Ireland emerged from the competition victorious, having won all three of their games without conceding a goal.

On 4 June 2011, Keane scored twice in a 2–0 away win against Macedonia in qualification for UEFA Euro 2012 to become the first Irish or British player to score more than 50 international goals. Following the game with Macedonia his total stood at 51 goals. He added another two goals in the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s 4–0 play-off hammering of Estonia in Tallinn which effectively secured qualification for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine to bring his goal tally to 53.

After a disappointing tournament in Poland, Keane brought his international tally to 54, with an 89th-minute penalty against Kazakhstan in the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s opening World Cup 2014 qualification match. This left the score at 1–1 before Kevin Doyle&#x27;s goal a minute later secured a winning start to the campaign. On 2 June 2013, Keane scored the third and fourth goals of the game, his 55th and 56th goals for the Republic of Ireland, against Georgia in a 4–0 win.

On 7 June 2013, Keane played his 126th game for the Republic of Ireland and became the new record appearance holder, breaking Shay Given&#x27;s previous record of 125 appearances. He also scored his second hat-trick of his international career in the same game against the Faroe Islands scoring his 57th, 58th and 59th goals in a 3–0 win for the Republic of Ireland. Keane scored his 60th international goal against Sweden on 6 September 2013, in a 2–1 loss. He went on to score his 61st and 62nd goals for the Republic of Ireland against Kazakhstan on 15 October 2013 in a 3–1 win and against Latvia a month later in a 3–0 victory, both games being played in Dublin.

Keane missed his chance to score his 63rd goal against Costa Rica in Philadelphia on 6 June 2014 when he missed a penalty in a friendly game. He was the highest male international scorer among active players following Miroslav Klose&#x27;s retirement in 2014. On 11 October 2014, he scored his third international hat-trick, his 63rd, 64th and 65th goals, in a 7–0 European qualifying win against Gibraltar at Aviva Stadium. The treble concluded with a penalty in the 18th minute. This took him to a record 21 goals in European Championship qualifiers, surpassing the 20 by Turkey&#x27;s Hakan Şükür. He would later extend his tally to 23 goals, although the record was broken by Portugal&#x27;s Cristiano Ronaldo on 10 September 2019.

Keane was selected in manager Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 in what would be his final major tournament appearance for the Republic of Ireland. However, he was restricted to a bench role and only played a total of 23 minutes against Sweden and Belgium respectively.

On 24 August 2016, Keane announced his retirement from international football. His last match for the Republic of Ireland was a friendly against Oman on 31 August 2016 at Aviva Stadium. The Republic of Ireland emerged victorious 4–0 and Keane signed off with a goal to take him level with German great Gerd Müller on 68 international goals. He received a rousing ovation from the assembled crowd when he was substituted in the 57th minute. Keane was also given a guard of honour from his Republic of Ireland teammates after the match had finished and he left the pitch with his two sons to rapturous applause from the home fans.

==Coaching career==
===ATK===
In March 2018, Keane was appointed player-manager of ATK after Sheringham and his replacement Ashley Westwood were sacked, with ATK finishing outside the play-offs. He scored the only goal in a 1–0 win over NorthEast United on his managerial debut, enough to save them from last place. After contesting the final three matches as player-manager, Keane decided to leave the club at the end of the season.

===Assistant===
In November 2018, Keane agreed to act as the assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland national team, under the management of newly appointed Mick McCarthy.

In June 2019, he accepted the dual roles of assistant manager of Middlesbrough in the Championship and the Republic of Ireland national team. His former Leeds and Tottenham teammate Jonathan Woodgate, who had been appointed the manager of the Teesside-based club, offered him the role as part of a refurbished coaching team. On 23 June 2020, Keane left his role as Middlesbrough assistant manager after his one-year contract came to an end during the COVID-19 pandemic. Keane completed UEFA coaching qualifications, receiving the UEFA Pro Licence in 2020.

On 3 May 2023, Keane joined the coaching staff of Premier League side Leeds, following the appointment of Sam Allardyce as manager. However, in the aftermath of the club&#x27;s relegation at the end of the season, both Allardyce and Keane left Leeds by mutual agreement on 2 June.

===Maccabi Tel Aviv===
On 26 June 2023, Keane was appointed new head coach of Israeli Premier League side Maccabi Tel Aviv, signing a two-year contract with the club and taking over his first managerial role. His former international teammate Rory Delap was named as his assistant. Keane&#x27;s appointment was criticised by the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which urged him to join &quot;the international athletes who fight for the rights of the Palestinians and oppose cooperating with apartheid&quot;, and by Sinn Féin TD Chris Andrews, who expressed disappointment that Keane had signed up with a &quot;racist and apartheid Israeli club&quot;. At his first press conference in Tel Aviv, Keane responded to a question &quot;I don&#x27;t want to get into politics. This is the last time I will say it. I&#x27;m here as a football man and someone that loves the game. I will certainly just focus on that but thanks for your question&quot;. Leo Varadkar, the Taoiseach in charge of the Irish government, defended Keane&#x27;s right to work in Israel.

Keane started his spell as manager with four wins and a draw to put Maccabi Tel Aviv on top of the league table. He was evacuated to Greece in October when the 2023 Israel–Hamas war began. While domestic football was cancelled, Keane&#x27;s team continued playing in the UEFA Europa Conference League, resuming with a 3–1 win away to another exiled team in FC Zorya Luhansk of Ukraine on 9 November, and continuing with their home games to Serbia. Keane led the club to victory in the 2024 Toto Cup on 24 January 2024.

Keane&#x27;s team reached the last 16 of the Europa Conference League and took a 4–1 win in the first leg away to eventual winners Olympiacos, but lost 7–5 on aggregate after extra time. He won the league in his only season, taking an eight-point lead over Maccabi Haifa with two games to go. At the end of the season Keane decided to leave the club.

In November 2024, Keane&#x27;s wife said that the family were still receiving threats from a small number of pro-Palestine activists, which had made her doubt their safety in Ireland. While he was targeted in Ireland for not leaving Israel during the war, he was also criticised within Israel for not endorsing the war.

=== Ferencvárosi TC ===
On 6 January 2025, Keane was hired as the next head coach of Ferencváros, replacing Pascal Jansen. He debuted with a 2–0 defeat from Eintracht Frankfurt at the Waldstadion in the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League league phase. Keane&#x27;s home debut ended with a 4–3 victory over AZ Alkmaar. Finally, Ferencváros qualified for the knock-out stage. On 2 February 2025, his first league match ended with a goalless draw against MTK Budapest FC in the Örökrangadó. After a 2–2 draw against Zalaegerszegi TE at the ZTE Arena, Keane&#x27;s Ferencváros suffered their first defeat in the Nemzeti Bajnokság I on 9 February 2025, when Ferencváros were defeated 1–0 by Puskás Akadémia FC at the Pancho Aréna. Puskás Akadémia also overtook Ferencváros on the table of the 2024–25 Nemzeti Bajnokság I season.

==Style of play==
A talented, quick, and agile player, Keane was a versatile forward, capable of playing anywhere along the front line, due to his ability to score and create goals. Throughout his career, he was often deployed in creative roles as a second striker, as a winger, or as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards, and as a main striker. A technically gifted, intelligent, and hard-working forward, Keane was also renowned for his pace, dribbling skills, and creativity, and also stood out for his leadership throughout his career.

Although he used many different goal celebrations throughout his career, Keane&#x27;s signature goalscoring celebration involved him performing a cartwheel, followed by a forward roll, and subsequently standing up and mimicking gesture of firing pistols with his hands.

==Personal life==
Keane married Xposé presenter and former Miss Ireland contestant Claudine Palmer in Ballybrack on 7 June 2008. They have two sons, born in 2009 and 2015. As of 2023, the elder son was playing for Shamrock Rovers.

Keane is a cousin of English singer Morrissey, and has himself been noted for his singing skills. His first cousin is Jason Byrne, the second-highest goalscorer in League of Ireland history. Keane holds a U.S. green card which qualifies him as a domestic player for MLS roster purposes. He achieved his UEFA &quot;A&quot; Licence in January 2016, via the Football Association of Ireland&#x27;s Coach Education Programme.

Keane stated his support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage in Ireland ahead of the referendum in 2015.

Keane and his family are of Roman Catholic faith with him having a crucifix tattood on his upper left arm.

Keane is an ambassador for the Children&#x27;s Medical &amp; Research Foundation in Crumlin, Dublin. Accompanied by his LA Galaxy teammates, Keane personally presented the hospital with a cheque for $50,000 from the LA Galaxy Foundation and Herbalife on 18 February 2015.

Keane and his wife Claudine supported the &quot;Our Hospital Heroes&quot; appeal by raising money for front line workers in hospitals across Ireland, by setting up a GoFundme page after a family member was diagnosed with COVID-19 and had to be admitted to hospital. The GoFundme page has raised over €81,000 as of July 2021.

<text>The char 2C, also known as the FCM 2C, was a French post WWI heavy tank landship, later considered a super-heavy tank. It was developed during World War I but not deployed until after the war. It was, in total volume or physical dimensions, the largest operational tank ever made.

Ten tanks were built in 1921. Although remaining operational, their value at the start of World War II was largely propagandistic. After Germany broke through French defences in June 1940, they were sent away from the front to preserve them. They were unable to reach safety and deliberately destroyed to prevent capture.

== Development ==
=== The &quot;char d&#x27;assaut de grand modèle&quot; ===
The origins of the Char 2C have always been shrouded in a certain mystery. In the summer of 1916, likely in July, General Léon Augustin Jean Marie Mourret, the Subsecretary of Artillery, verbally granted &quot;Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée&quot; (FCM), a shipyard in the south of France near Toulon, the contract for the development of a heavy tank, a &quot;char d&#x27;assaut de grand modèle&quot;. At the time, French industry was very active in lobbying for defence orders, using their connections with high-placed officials and officers to obtain commissions; development contracts could be very profitable even when not resulting in actual production, as they were fully paid for by the state. The French Army had no stated requirement for a heavy tank, and there was no official policy to procure one. Hence, the decision seemed to have been taken solely on his personal authority. The reason he later gave was that the British tanks then in development by a naval committee seemed to be better devised as regarded lay-out, ventilation and fire protection, so a shipyard might improve on existing French designs.
Exact specifications, if they ever existed, have been lost. FCM then largely neglected the project, apart from reaping the financial benefits. At that time, all tank projects were highly secret, and thereby shielded from public scrutiny.

On 15 September 1916, the British introduced their Mark I (heavy) tank at the Battle of the Somme, The public mood in Britain had been growing ever darker as the overall failure of the Somme Offensive became known, tanks offered a new hope of final victory. The French public wanted to know about their own national tank projects and French politicians, up til then not having been greatly involved in them and leaving the matter to the military, were also interested. This sudden attention greatly alarmed Mourret, who promptly investigated the progress that had been made at FCM and was shocked to find there was none. On 30 September, he personally took control of the project. On 12 October, knowing that the Renault company had some months earlier made several proposals to build a heavy tracked mortar which had been rejected, he begged Louis Renault to assist FCM in the development of a suitable heavy vehicle; this request Renault obliged. Even before knowing what the exact nature of the project would be, on 20 October Mourret ordered one prototype to be built by FCM.

This development coincided with a political demand by Minister of Armaments Albert Thomas to produce a tank superior to the British types. On 7 October, he had asked the British prime minister David Lloyd George to deliver some Mark Is to France but had received no answer. Concluding, correctly, that no such deliveries would materialise, on 23 January 1917 he ordered that French tanks should be developed that were faster, and more powerfully armed and armoured than any British vehicle. He specified a weight of forty tonnes, immunity against light artillery rounds and a trench-crossing capability of 3.5 metres.

Meanwhile, Renault had consulted his own team, led by Rodolphe Ernst-Metzmaier, which since May 1916 had been in the process of designing the revolutionary Renault FT light tank. This work had not, however, stopped them from considering other tank types. Renault, always expecting his employees to provide new ideas instantly, had by this attitude encouraged the team to take a proactive stance – setting a pattern that would last until 1940 – and to have various kinds of contingency studies ready for the occasion, including a feasibility study for a heavy tank. This fortunate circumstance allowed a full-size wooden mockup to be constructed in a remarkably quick time. It was visited by the Undersecretary of State for Inventions for National Defense Jules-Louis Breton on 13 January 1917, who was much impressed and developed a keen interest in the project. The design was presented to the Consultative Committee of the Assault Artillery on 16 and 17 January 1917, after the basic concept had been approved on 30 December. This proposed tank was the most advanced design of its time; it was received very favourably, also because of the enthusiastic report by Breton, and a consensus began to form that the project was most promising and a potential &quot;war-winner&quot;. It featured a 105 mm gun in a turret and had a proposed weight of 38 tons, as well as 35 mm armour. The committee decided to have two prototypes developed, one with an electrical transmission, the other with a hydraulic transmission. In this period, both the French and British military had become aware of severe mobility and steering problems with heavy tracked vehicles; the French designs paralleled extensive British experiments with all kinds of improved tank transmissions to solve them.

===Resistance to the project===
In January 1917, the Ministry of Armament proposed building three weight classes of tanks: light, medium, and heavy tanks, the latter class corresponding to the new project. However, brigadier Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne, commander of the new tank force, the Assault Artillery, was closely cooperating with Renault in the development of the Renault FT, and by this was well informed of the other tank project. Estienne feared that production of heavy tanks would use all available production facilities, making procurement of the - much more practical - Renault FT light tank impossible. He was not averse to the production of heavy tanks but only in a limited number and provided it did not impede the manufacture of light tanks. In November Mourret argued that all available resources should be concentrated into heavy tank production and development of the Renault FT halted. Alarmed, Estienne wrote to the Commander-in-Chief, General Joseph Joffre, on 27 November 1916 defending the light tank concept. He admitted that &quot;colossal landships&quot; might in certain circumstances have their uses, but claimed that while it was as yet unproven that a workable heavy type could be developed, let alone produced in sufficient numbers by French industry, it would be folly not to give priority to light tanks that could be constructed without delay. He insisted that Joffre use all his influence to bring about the cancellation of the heavy tank project.

Joffre answered that Estienne was no doubt correct in his tactical and organisational analysis, but that political backing of the heavy tank was simply too strong. The Minister of Armament, Albert Thomas, had committed himself openly to Mourret&#x27;s cause and did not dare to retract support now. Joffre advised Estienne that he would make sure that the Renault FT would not be cancelled, and since heavy tank development would take such a long time it would not - for the immediate future - get in the way of light tank production. There would surely be no harm in allowing some prototypes to be built.

The Consultative Committee of the Assault Artillery (&quot;Comité Consultatif de l&#x27;Artillerie d&#x27;Assaut&quot;, CCAS) had been created on 13 December 1916 and met for the first time on 17 December. During this first session it was reported that Renault and FCM were cooperating on a heavy tank project of thirty tonnes. Estienne on this occasion stressed that production should be &quot;orientated towards small types and very large types&quot;. During the next meeting on 30 December, Estienne was surprised to discover that for no clear reasons a 105 mm gun was planned; he himself preferred a 75 mm gun. Estienne was absent on the crucial meeting of 17 January, but by letter informed the committee that he found the project satisfactory and agreed with the quick construction of two prototypes; he stated his preference for a 75 mm over a 105 mm gun.

In December Joffre was replaced as supreme commander by Robert Nivelle. In late January Nivelle learned of the heavy tank project from Estienne. He was much more alarmed than Joffre had been. On 29 January he wrote a letter to Thomas, making clear that under no circumstances could the project be allowed to impede production of the Schneider CA. Thomas answered on 5 February that there was no danger of this; anyway he had just happened to affirm on 1 February the policy of General Mourret, who had already ordered the simultaneous development of three prototypes: the lightened 30-tonne &quot;A&quot; version, 6.92 metres long, with a 75 mm gun, to fulfil the original order of 20 October; the 45-tonne &quot;B&quot; version with a longer hull (7.39 metres), armed with a 75 mm gun and two machine guns, and the 62-ton &quot;C&quot; version 9.31 meters long with a 75 mm gun. Nivelle&#x27;s misgivings were reinforced by inquiries from a parliamentary financial commission led by Pierre Renaudel. A plan by Breton to immediately order fifty vehicles more or less identical to the mock-up was therefore rejected. The 1 February order of two additional prototypes was confirmed by the CCAS on 7 February. Eventually the &quot;FCM 1A&quot; would be developed with a 105 mm gun and the &quot;FCM 1B&quot; would use a petrol-mechanical transmission.

At first, progress with the FCM 1A prototype was satisfactory. Moritz was assured by Renault in January 1917 that the desired engines were reliable and would pose no danger to the project. Moritz predicted that the first prototype would be ready by 1 May 1917. On 10 April 1917 he still assumed that the first trials could have begun within five weeks. On 16 April the Nivelle offensive began, although it had tactical successes it failed to deal a strategic defeat on German forces and the first use of French tanks led to heavy losses (76 of the 128 combat tanks engaged were lost); in reaction Thomas ordered all tank production and projects to be ended. This led to an emergency alliance between Estienne and Mourret to bring about a reversal of this decision. While Thomas was visiting Russia, Mourret surreptitiously ordered a restart of the tank projects. On his return an enraged Thomas caused Mourret to be fired, removing Estienne&#x27;s greatest rival. Meanwhile, there were unexplained delays in the delivery of the engines and the gearbox by Renault. On 5 June, FCM could only take note that the promised pieces had not arrived yet. On 24 June the ministry of armament complained about the situation. On 13 August Breton was told by Renault personally that it would take at least another three weeks. A possible explanation of the delays might be a decision by Renault to give priority to other projects. During a meeting of the CCAS on 18 October, Moritz at last announced that trials could begin on 20 November. In that meeting Estienne was critical of heavy tanks: &quot;the infantry has as much need of large tanks, as it needs 400 mm cannon; it has need of small tanks, as much as it needs 37 mm and machine-guns&quot;.

===The FCM 1A===

On 17 November, Moritz, introducing to the CCAS the forthcoming presentation of the FCM 1A prototype, explained it was a test bed that did not exactly correspond to the original &quot;A version&quot; specifications. The company, in its efforts to get a vehicle ready as soon as possible, had built a prototype that was largely based on the original mock-up and so much closer to the &quot;B&quot;-concept, albeit with a 105 mm gun and a petrol-mechanical transmission; hydraulic transmission had been abandoned by the CCAS on 10 May.

IT was the largest tank built until that date. It had a length of , a width of , a hull height of , a turret roof height of with cupola included . It was also the first tank with protection against artillery HE rounds: the front hull was protected by 35 mm (1.38 in) thick armour plate as was the turret. The sides and rear were 21 mm (0.83 in) plate, the top and roof 15 mm (0.6 in). Total weight was 41.4 tonnes, of which 5.5 tonnes of hull armour and 1.3 tonnes of turret armour.

The hull of the FCM 1A was very elongated, in order to cross wide trenches. It was more-or-less compartmentalised into four sections, but these were not separated by bulkheads: a relatively short driver compartment at the front, a fighting compartment with a turret at its top, a larger munitions room and finally a large engine compartment at the rear. The last was enlarged at both sides over the tracks, to create room for long rectangular fuel tanks. The front of the hull followed the profile of the tall climbing faces of the tracks and therefore gradually curved upwards, ending in a high vertical nose plate. The glacis plate behind it was oriented almost horizontally and connected at its rear to the vertical top front plate of the driver compartment. As the turret ring was larger than the width of the hull, it partly rested on rounded lateral extensions. The turret was a truncated cone with a roof sloping down to the front, so that in side view its profile was wedge-shaped.

Originally a crew of seven had been planned, but in December 1917 this had been reduced to six: the commander in the left of the turret aimed the gun; a second man in the right of the turret who combined the functions of gunner, machine-gunner and loader; a standing assistant-loader handing new rounds to the loader – at first two of these had been seen as necessary; a driver; a front machine-gunner; and a mechanic who doubled as a rear machine-gunner.

The main armament was the &quot;Canon de 105 Court Schneider&quot;, a 105 mm shortened to reduce its recoil to fit into a turret. It fired a HE shell with of explosives at a muzzle velocity of . The large hull allowed for a large ammunition stock of 122 rounds. The commander pointed the gun by observing the target through a vane sight, fitted on the turret roof, from his rectangular &quot;cupola&quot;. There were two Hotchkiss 8 mm machine-guns in fixed ball-mount positions; reserve machine-guns or pistols could be fired through five vertical slits that could be plugged: one at the rear of the turret, two at the turret sides and two at the hull sides below the turret rear.

In the prototype, a single Renault engine was installed, giving a maximum speed of and a minimum speed of . The transmission was mechanical, using a disc clutch driving the tracks through a rear sprocket. The suspension was leaf sprung bogies of four wheels each with alternating external and internal flanges. The tracks, wide, gave a ground pressure of . Ground clearance was . The design deliberately had no overhanging front or rear sections, which had greatly hampered the mobility of the earlier French Schneider CA1 and Saint Chamond tanks. The tank could overcome a vertical obstacle and cross a trench wide.

Mourret&#x27;s stated motive in having the tank designed by a shipyard ensured much attention was given to ergonomics. It was less cramped than earlier designs; the crew could walk, slightly crouching, throughout the hull. The mechanic could access the engine from both sides, and the commander could communicate with the driver, the front machine-gunner and the mechanic via speaking tubes. External communications were the responsibility of the mechanic, who could open a small hatch just behind the turret to signal using flags, flares or electrical lights. The tank could be entered through the turret cupola, but each crew-member also had escape hatches above or below him.

===Orders===
On 20 December 1917 the first prototype was ready to be shown to an investigating commission of the CCAS, with actual trials being held at La Seyne-sur-Mer on 21 and 22 December. Mourret had been replaced as head of the commission by Estienne; British and American observers were present. The FCM 1A, with its futuristic appearance, made an excellent impression on those present. Moritz demonstrated that the vehicle was effortlessly capable of crossing 3.5 metre wide trenches, climb ninety centimetre high walls and descend into, and climb out of again, six metres wide and four metres deep craters. In woods, it could break a 28 centimetre thick pine tree and run over a 35 centimetre thick one. A speed of 6 km/h was attained. The main problem was that it proved difficult to steer the tank due to its extreme track length and insufficient chain link profile. The track would easily slip when braked, though it was on no occasion thrown. The aircraft engine tended to overheat and its basic lack of power resulted in a maximum 65% climbing slope. Though the first shortened 105 mm Schneider cannon had been received in October, the first live firing tests were only held on 5 and 7 February 1918, with satisfactory results.

Discussing the results of the trials, on 4 January 1918 the technical department of the &quot;Artillerie Spéciale&quot; concluded that the FCM 1A seemed a powerful combat vehicle capable of having an important negative effect on enemy morale. Already on 30 December, minister of munitions Louis Loucheur had thought that France &quot;hadn&#x27;t a minute to lose&quot; and suggested to the French Prime Minister (&quot;Président du conseil&quot;) Georges Clemenceau to spend fifty million French francs to construct a hundred FCM 1As, the first fifteen to be delivered from July 1918 onwards, in order to have a strength of eighty vehicles on 31 December. However, Clemenceau would leave the decision to Estienne.

General Philippe Pétain, the new High Commander of the French Army, asked Estienne to use his position to end the project. Estienne told Pétain that this was ill-advised while the public was questioning why these heavy tanks had not been produced. Besides, the British and the US would only consent to give France 700 of the new jointly designed Mark VIII &quot;Liberty&quot; heavy tank if France had made at least a token effort to produce its own heavy tanks. Thus the French authorities had to delay the project while outwardly endorsing it. Estienne had already set this course by choosing the heaviest version, the &quot;C&quot;, for production, requiring a completely new prototype, causing a considerable delay. Then Pétain demanded unreasonably high production numbers, thus delaying planning and initiating a political row.

Pétain asked for 300 heavy tanks to be ready by March 1919, for the Allied Plan 1919 strategy causing a quarrel to erupt between Clemenceau, who was both Prime Minister and Minister of War, and Loucheur, the Minister of Armament, who felt it was impossible to provide the labour and steel required. Meanwhile, Estienne and Pétain complicated the issue with further demands. Pétain asked for special pontoons, and Estienne demanded battering rams and electronic mine detectors to be fixed. When the war ended, not a single tank had been built.

At first, the production order for the char 2C was cancelled. Despite the end of hostilities, however, strong political pressure to adopt new heavy tank projects remained, as there was now a considerable surplus capacity in the heavy industry. To stop this, the &quot;Direction de l’Artillerie d’Assaut&quot; on instigation of Estienne decided in April 1919 to procure ten char 2Cs after all, and use this as an argument to reject any other projects. This was not completely successful; as late as 1920 it was proposed to the &quot;Section Technique des Appareils de Combat&quot; to build a 600-tonne tank with 250 mm armour. At FCM, Jammy and Savatier finished the char 2C prototype, the other nine tanks being built almost simultaneously; all ten were delivered in 1921 and modified by the factory until 1923. They would be the last French tanks to be produced for the home market till the char D1 pre-series of 1931.

==Description==

The char 2C was the only super-heavy tank ever to attain operational status – a super-heavy tank is not simply a tank that is very heavy but one that has been deliberately made much heavier than regular tanks of its period. The next operational tank in weight would be the 70-tonne German Tiger II heavy tank of World War II, nearly 500 of which were produced.

The char 2C had a loaded weight of 69 tonnes, partly because of its armour, which was among the thickest of World War I-era tanks, but mostly because of its huge size. It is the largest tank ever taken into production. With the tail fitted, the hull was over long. Without tail, the hull length was , the width , the height . With the main turret cupola, normally detached for transport, in place the overall height was . The long track to relatively narrow width hampered steering and its manoeuvrability.

Its large size and weight made transportation difficult reducing strategic manoeuvrability. To move the tanks by rail they had to be slung between two (specially built) rail wagons; a process that took around four hours.

The armour thickness was 30 mm at the front, 22 mm at the sides, 13 mm at the top and 10 mm at the bottom. In 1930 and 1931, the vehicles were rebuilt with a frontal armour of .

Within its ample frame there was room for two fighting compartments. The forward compartment was crowned by a three-man turret – the first such in history – mounting a shortened 75 mm field gun of the &quot;Canon de 75 modèle 1897&quot; type, with 124 rounds firing at a muzzle velocity of , and the second, at the rear of the tank, was topped by a machine-gun turret armed with a Hotchkiss 8 mm. The front turret, made of 35 mm plates, was placed so high that its crew had to climb into it by means of a ladder, sitting on seats suspended from the turret roof and operating on an elevated level compared to the hull machine gunners below. The rear turret was made of 22 mm thick plate. Three independent 8 mm machine guns all in ballmounts, one at each side and one to the right of the driver at the front, gave protection against infantry assault. The machinegun ammunition load was 9,504 rounds.

Both turrets had stroboscopic cupolas as a solution to the problems of direct vision from a tank. An inner cylindrical frame carried thick glass vision blocks. Around this was a thick (30mm) armoured shell pierced with narrow slots spaced evenly. In use an electric motor spun the outer shell at such a speed that, due to persistence of vision effect, the individual slots disappeared while their armour protection (including against bullet splash) remained.

The fighting compartments were connected by the engine room. In the design four engines had been planned but this was reduced to two, each track being powered by its own engine via an electrical transmission. The first engines were of the Chenu type, of each. In 1923, these were replaced by captured German 6-cylinder Mercedes engines allowing for a top speed of . These original engines wore out quickly and were eventually in turn replaced by two Maybach engines, 16,950 cc, which rendered a maximum speed of . A corridor, tall enough for a crewman to stand upright, ran between the engines, allowing two electricians to constantly attend the complex apparatus. Seven fuel tanks, four to the left and three to the right, containing 1,260 litres, gave it a range of 150 kilometres. The suspension contained thirty-nine interleaving road wheels on each side, making for a total of ninety wheels on the tank. Designed to negotiate the challenging terrain of trench warfare, the type had in principle excellent mobility. The char 2C could cross a trench 4.25 metres wide, enough to pass the typical canal sluices in northern France. A vertical obstacle could be climbed of 170 centimetres and a slope of 70%. The wading capacity was 140 centimetres. Ground clearance was sixty centimetres. The axle track, measured between the inner track sides, was 225 centimetres.

The tank required a crew of twelve: driver, commander, gunner, loader, four machine gunners, mechanic, electrician, assistant-electrician/mechanic and a radio operator. Some sources report thirteen, probably due to pictures of the crews that included the company commander. The assistant-mechanic was seated to the front right of the rear fighting compartment, over an escape hatch, and the radio operator was seated at the front left.

==Operational history==
The ten tanks were part of several consecutive units, their organic strength at one time reduced to three. Their military value slowly decreased as more advanced tanks were developed throughout the 1920s and 1930s. By the end of the 1930s they were largely obsolete, because their slow speed and high-profile made them vulnerable to advances in anti-tank guns.

Nevertheless, during the French mobilisation of 1939, all ten were activated and put into their own unit, the 51st &quot;Bataillon de Chars de Combat&quot;. For propaganda, each tank had been named after one of the ancient regions of France, numbers 90-99 being named &quot;Poitou; Provence; Picardie; Alsace; Bretagne; Touraine; Anjou; Normandie; Berry; Champagne&quot; respectively. In 1939, the &quot;Normandie&quot; was renamed &quot;Lorraine&quot;. As their main value was in propaganda, the giants were kept carefully out of harm&#x27;s way and did not participate in the September 1939 attack on the Siegfried Line. They were used instead for numerous morale-boosting movies, in which they were often shown climbing and crushing old French forts. To the public, they obtained the reputation of invincible super tanks, the imagined dimensions of which far surpassed the actual particulars.

French command was aware that this reputation was undeserved. When the German &quot;Panzerdivisionen&quot;, in the execution of Operation &quot;Fall Rot&quot;, breached the French lines after 10 June 1940, the decision was made to prevent the capture of the famous equipment. On 12 June 1940 the order was given to send the tanks south by rail transport. The broken down tanks N° 92 and 95 were destroyed, at Mairy-Mainville and Piennes respectively. The six remaining tanks hastily embarked on two trains at the station of Landres on 13 June. During the night they hid, still loaded, in the forest of Badonviller. As no orders had been received regarding their destination, they remained at this spot during the 14th, being bombed in the early afternoon but without incurring any damage. In the late afternoon, an order arrived to send the tanks to Neufchâteau which was reached in the early morning of 15 June. There it was decided to travel to Dijon. However, fifteen kilometres south of Neufchâteau near the Meuse-sur-Meuse station, in a curve of the railway, the track was blocked by a blazing fuel train, while other trains jammed the exit to the rear. Due to the curve, it was impossible to unload the tanks. To prevent a capture of the matériel by the enemy, it was ordered to destroy the vehicles. Charges were placed and the fuel pipes cut. The gasoline was lit and the tanks exploded around 19:00. The crews escaped to the south. The wrecks were subsequently discovered by the &quot;8. Panzerdivision&quot;. Later Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Goering claimed that the tanks had been destroyed by German dive bombers. This German propaganda myth was accepted as an authentic event by contemporary writers and later repeated in many postwar sources. One tank, the &quot;Champagne&quot;, was nevertheless captured more or less intact and brought to Berlin to be exhibited as a war trophy until disappearing in 1948. After the war, rumours circulated that this vehicle had been transported to the Soviet Union.

==Versions==
After a decision taken in December 1922, from 1923 until 1926 the later &quot;Champagne&quot; was modified at La Seyne into the Char 2C bis, an experimental type with a 155 mm howitzer in a rounded cast steel turret. The howitzer had a muzzle velocity of 200 m/s. New engines of the Soutter-Harlé type were fitted and the three independent machine gun positions deleted. In this configuration the tank weighed perhaps 74 tons. The change was only temporary though, as the vehicle was brought back into its previous condition after 1934; the new turret was used in the Tunisian Mareth Line.

Between 15 November and 15 December 1939 the &quot;Lorraine&quot;, as the company command tank, was experimentally up-armoured at the &quot;Société des Aciéries d&#x27;Homecourt&quot; to make it immune to standard German antitank guns. The front armour was enhanced to 90 mm, the side to 65 mm. In this configuration, weighing about 75 tons, the &quot;Lorraine&quot; had at that time the thickest armour of any operational tank, and is probably still the heaviest operational tank ever.

==Replacement==
In 1940, twelve FCM F1 tanks were ordered, another very large twin-turret tank. France was defeated before they entered service.

<text>Stuart Drummond (born 29 November 1973) is a British politician, who was the first and only directly elected mayor of Hartlepool in North East England. He was first elected in 2002, under the guise of H&#x27;Angus the Monkey, the town&#x27;s football club&#x27;s mascot, and was re-elected in 2005 and 2009. He was the first elected mayor in Britain to win a third term. He stood down when his term ended in May 2013 after the councillors and people of Hartlepool voted to abolish the mayoral system on 15 November 2012.

==Biography==
Drummond was born 29 November 1973. He attended Hartlepool Sixth Form College, before he gained a HND in business finance and languages at the University of Salford. He worked on cruise ships, travelling the globe for a couple of years and then worked in a call centre back in his home town. Before his election, he was the mascot – H&#x27;Angus the Monkey – for Hartlepool United F.C.

==Mayor of Hartlepool==
Drummond stood for election to Mayor of the Borough of Hartlepool, a unitary authority in the north east of England, in the 2002 election. He considered standing for MP in the 2001 General Election, but decided against it.

He approached Hartlepool United Football Club chairman Ken Hodcroft with the idea to stand for Mayor and the club was happy to put up his £500 election deposit. The club saw it as a chance to generate publicity and their name and club sponsors were given a global platform. Drummond took part in no serious campaigning and among his promises was for the council to provide free bananas for school children in the town - which he later delivered. Online bookmakers Bet365 offered odds on Drummond / H&#x27;Angus being elected and odds tumbled in one day from 100-1 to 4-1 as his supporters showed their support.

Drummond was narrowly elected, beating the second place, high-profile Labour Party candidate by 5,696 to 5,174. The result was greeted with widespread hilarity, attracting attention far beyond Hartlepool. Canada&#x27;s &quot;National Post&quot; newspaper ran the headline &quot;Monkey wins mayoralty, regains human form&quot;. The Northern Echo ran with &#x27;Monkey Is Mayor&quot; - despite the paper&#x27;s deadline being before the actual result was declared, such was the confidence within Drummond&#x27;s camp on the night of the vote.

After his election, Drummond immediately stood down as mascot. He said: &quot;I am just a normal guy off the street, listening to the views of the public and I am the voice of the public. I haven&#x27;t got a big party backing me and I have been using the monkey to promote myself, promote my campaign.&quot; Peter Mandelson, the town&#x27;s then MP, was present at the count in the Mill House Sports Centre in the early hours of the morning and cut an unhappy figure as his candidate, Leo Gillen, was beaten. Drummond alleged that Mandelson pulled him to one side and called him a &quot;disgrace&quot; and said that he&#x27;d &quot;made the town a laughing stock&quot;.

On 5 May 2005, Drummond was re-elected as the mayor of Hartlepool with an increased majority of 10,205.

On 4 June 2009, Drummond was re-elected for a third term.

In 2010 Drummond was a finalist for the World Mayor prize.

A campaign group set up in 2006 hoped to petition for a referendum that would abolish the office of mayor and adopt the leader and cabinet system of local government leadership. The referendum occurred on 15 November 2012, after the majority Labour group on Hartlepool council established a referendum which resulted in the council leader and cabinet system being favoured. The leader and cabinet system became the governance structure for the council in May 2013.

Since his reign as Mayor, Drummond remained in Hartlepool until 2022 and was a prominent figurehead amongst local businesses acting as a consultant for several organisations.

==Personal life==
On his re-election in 2005, he immediately proposed to his then girlfriend, who accepted and said yes. The pair were married a year later.

Drummond appeared on the ITV game show Tenable in April 2018. He and his team mates were all Hartlepool fans and named their team &quot;The Cheeky Monkey Hangers&quot;. They failed to win a cash prize.

In October 2021, Drummond revealed that he and his family were emigrating to Australia the following year.

<doc id="625376" wikidata="Q21992967" url="?curid=625376" title="King Benjamin">
<text>In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin, son of the first King Mosiah, is the second Nephite king to rule over Zarahemla. He is considered a king and a prophet and acts as both a spiritual and governmental leader. He is most associated with a speech to the people which begins in the second chapter of the Book of Mosiah and idealizes the life of a yeoman farmer.

== Synopsis ==
Benjamin is the son of Mosiah, a Nephite king who reigned in the land of Zarahemla and whom Benjamin succeeds, going on to lead the Nephites as both a king and a prophet. 

== Textual history ==
In the printer&#x27;s manuscript and 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, the text of Mosiah 21:28 and Ether 4:1 narrate, respectively, Ammon telling Limhi that king Benjamin has a gift for the miraculous translation of texts, and Mormon noting that Benjamin kept in his possession Jaredite records, specifically the writings of the Brother of Jared. In the 1837 edition of the Book of Mormon, Mosiah 21:28 is emended (probably by Joseph Smith) so instead of &quot;Benjamin&quot;, the text states &quot;Mosiah&quot;. For the 1849 Latter-day Saint edition, apostle Orson Pratt edited Ether 4:1 to similarly replace &quot;Benjamin&quot; with &quot;Mosiah&quot;. The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints&#x27; (later renamed to Community of Christ) 1908 and 1953 editions of the Book of Mormon leave the name &quot;Benjamin&quot; in Ether 4:1 but include a parenthetical &quot;Mosiah?&quot; to suggest the text might be supposed to read &quot;Mosiah&quot; rather than &quot;Benjamin&quot;.

== Interpretations ==

=== Speech ===
Donald Parry reports that Benjamin&#x27;s speech is &quot;one of the most influential sermons&quot; from the Book of Mormon. In his speech, Benjamin urges his audience to accept communal responsibility for collective material wellbeing. G. St. John Stott compares Benjamin&#x27;s economic ideal to the &quot;by 1830… old-fashioned&quot; agricultural &quot;yeoman dream, in which economic independence and a modest standard of living defined one&#x27;s ambition&quot;. Benjamin lives by his own manual labor and doesn&#x27;t try to accumulate wealth.

=== Textual emendations ===
The edits to Mosiah 21:28 and Ether 4:1 likely happened because of uncertainty about the timeline of events in the Book of Mormon. When Benjamin passes the throne on to Mosiah, Mormon states that Benjamin lives three more years before dying and then narrates the departure of Ammon&#x27;s expedition, giving the impression Benjamin is already dead when Ammon leaves, thus prompting the 1837 emendation so Ammon refers to the living Mosiah instead. Additionally, after meeting Ammon, Limhi brings 24 Jaredite plates to Zarahemla to be translated by Benjamin&#x27;s son Mosiah; if Ether 4:1 refers to these records, a rendering of &quot;Benjamin&quot; seems like a contradiction, as Benjamin would have to be alive to receive them, and earlier the Book of Mormon had narrated it was Mosiah who received and translated the records, not Benjamin.

Latter-day Saint author Hugh Nibley believed the Ether 4:1 emendation was &quot;[p]robably not&quot; necessary for coherence since a viable reading of the Book of Mormon could allow for the three years of Benjamin&#x27;s remaining life to not have fully elapsed before Limhi brings his Jaredite plates to Zarahemla, and keeping charge of Jaredite records would be consistent with his character as a &quot;life-long book-lover&quot;. This also allows for Benjamin to be alive at the time of Mosiah 21:28.

Alternatively, Ether 4:1 refers not to the Jaredite plates possessed by Limhi but to records that Benjamin had that were entirely different from those that Mosiah received, allowing for Benjamin to be dead when Ammon tells Limhi about him and when Limhi brings the 24 Jaredite plates to Zarahemla.

<text>A-Sides is a compilation album by the American rock band Soundgarden with songs spanning the band&#x27;s thirteen-year career. It was released on November 4, 1997, through A&amp;M Records.

==Overview==
Guitarist Kim Thayil said the song list emerged out of list of what each member &quot;thought would make a &#x27;best of&#x27; and then we cross-referenced them&quot;, adding that while the typical compilation titles &#x27;Best Of&#x27; and &#x27;Greatest Hits&#x27; was thought by them to a subjective name - &quot;that&#x27;s something that an individual fan can make of his own collection,and these aren&#x27;t necessarily our personal favourites&quot; - they went with &quot;A-Sides&quot; to reflect that these were the A-side singles released on the band&#x27;s original run. The opening track &quot;Nothing to Say&quot; was originally a B-side to the band&#x27;s first single &quot;Hunted Down&quot; on Sub Pop in 1987, but Thayil said it took precedence for being their first song to draw a label&#x27;s attention as part of a compilation titled &quot;Bands That Will Make Money&quot;. It contains one song absent from previous albums (&quot;Bleed Together&quot;) which appeared on import copies of the &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; single. In addition, &quot;Get on the Snake&quot; from &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; was released as a promo-only single in 1989. Also, the 1990 Sub Pop single &quot;Room a Thousand Years Wide&quot; does not appear on &quot;A-Sides&quot;, nor the 1994 single &quot;My Wave&quot; from &quot;Superunknown&quot;.

The album was released in 1997 on A&amp;M Records and was Soundgarden&#x27;s last official release for 13 years, until 2010&#x27;s &quot;Telephantasm&quot;. It debuted at number 63 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. &quot;A-Sides&quot; has sold over 500,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan and over 700,000 copies worldwide, but has not yet been certified by the RIAA. It peaked at number 51 on the UK Albums Chart, number 39 on the Australian Albums Chart, and number 6 on the New Zealand Albums Chart.

AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars. He said, &quot;For an act that was one of the definitive album artists of the late &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s, Soundgarden was a surprisingly effective singles band. Their singles effectively conveyed all of their best ideas, from their sludgy early Sub Pop recordings to the elaborate, post-metal psychedelia of their last two albums, &quot;Superunknown&quot; and &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;. That&#x27;s the reason why the 17-track compilation &quot;A-Sides&quot; is such a successful overview of the band&#x27;s too-brief career.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewer David Browne gave the album an A. He said, &quot;Pruning their best early songwriting (&quot;Hands All Over&quot;, &quot;Nothing to Say&quot;) and wisely highlighting chunks of their last two (and best) albums, &quot;A-Sides&quot; presents the band in all its evolving, bridling-horses glory and thunder. When all those Hanson fans grow up and want to educate themselves on the flannel era they missed, here&#x27;s where they should turn.&quot;

Following Chris Cornell&#x27;s death in May 2017, &quot;A-Sides&quot; re-entered the Australian albums chart at number 47. On Record Store Day 2018, &quot;A-Sides&quot; was released on double green translucent vinyl.

<doc id="625380" wikidata="Q6411912" url="?curid=625380" title="King Noah">
<text>King Noah () is a Nephite king in the Book of Mormon who appears in the Book of Mosiah. Noah rules over a colony of Nephites who come from Zarahemla and settle in the land of Lehi-Nephi, succeeding his father, Zeniff. In the Book of Mosiah, King Noah distances from his father&#x27;s teachings, committing what the text calls &quot;all manner of wickedness.&quot; Noah and his priests sentence a prophet named Abinadi, who prophesies of his kingdom&#x27;s downfall if they did not repent, to death by fire. During a Lamanite invasion, Noah and some of his people flee the land, and those who remain are subjected to Lamanite control. Noah attempts to forbid his men from returning to their families, and they burn him at the stake. Noah is succeeded by his son, Limhi.

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) commonly label Noah a &quot;wicked king&quot;, with his character typically presented in a negative light. Art historians and other commenters suggest that Arnold Friberg&#x27;s painting, &quot;Abinadi Before King Noah&quot;, has contributed to many Latter-day Saints&#x27; perceptions of the story of King Noah. LDS commentators write that Noah&#x27;s reign is an example of a system of absolute power and discuss the defining traits of Noah&#x27;s character.

== Background ==
King Noah first appears in the eleventh chapter of the Book of Mosiah, where he succeeds his father as king over the Nephite colony at around 160 BC. Noah is killed in the nineteenth chapter, at around 145 BC. The story of King Noah directly follows the first-person account of Zeniff, but the narration point of view shifts to the third person.

=== Nephite-Lamanite contention ===
Noah&#x27;s father, Zeniff, started a Nephite colony within the land of Nephi (also referred to as the land of Lehi-Nephi) by forming a peace treaty with the king of the Lamanites who inhabited the land. The Lamanite king eventually betrayed their agreement, resulting in several land battles between the Nephite colony and the Lamanite people.

== Narrative ==

=== The reign of King Noah ===
In the Book of Mosiah, Noah inherits the kingship over the Nephite colony residing in the land of Lehi-Nephi. Rather than continuing Zeniff&#x27;s example of leading with faith in God, Noah breaks away from his father&#x27;s teachings of righteousness. During his reign, he commits “whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.” King Noah imposes a 20% possession tax on his people to support his “riotous” manner of living and organizes architectural developments in the land, including a large and ornate temple for his personal use. He has “many wives and concubines” and dismisses his father&#x27;s priests, replacing them with priests of his choosing. Noah&#x27;s priests, like Noah himself, are prideful and participate in “whoredoms.” The people of Lehi-Nephi accompany King Noah in falling away from Zeniff&#x27;s teachings, similarly committing sins, becoming drunkards, and worshiping idols.

The Nephite colony&#x27;s violent contentions with the Lamanite people who also inhabit the land of Nephi do not cease upon King Noah&#x27;s reign. The Lamanites attack the Nephites’ flocks, and the guards Noah sends are killed. Noah sends an army to push out the Lamanites. The army is victorious, and Noah and his people attribute their success to their abilities rather than to God.

=== Noah and Abinadi ===
The prophet Abinadi preaches to the Nephite colony that they will be “brought into bondage” by their enemies if they do not repent for their wickedness. Abinadi condemns the actions of King Noah and his people, and Noah commands his people to capture Abinadi so he may kill him, but Abinadi gets away. Two years later, Abinadi returns to continue his call for the repentance of the Nephite people, prophesying of their destruction if they refuse. The Nephites bring Abinadi to King Noah, who imprisons him on the grounds of spreading lies about King Noah and teaching false prophecy. Noah and his priests conduct a trial where they decide to kill Abinadi, and Abinadi responds with “the message which the Lord sent [him] to deliver.” Abinadi spends three days in prison and is brought back before King Noah. Noah sentences Abinadi to death but is afraid of the prophet&#x27;s warning of his people&#x27;s future suffering. Noah&#x27;s priests convince the king to kill Abinadi despite his fear. As Abinadi is burnt at the stake, he prophesies that King Noah will die in the same manner.

=== Lamanite invasion and Noah&#x27;s death ===
Alma, one of Noah&#x27;s priests, believes Abinadi&#x27;s words and continues his preaching to Noah&#x27;s people, asking them to repent. Under Noah&#x27;s direction, Alma is forced out of the land, taking those he convinced to repent with him. A division forms between the remainder of Noah&#x27;s people, and a man named Gideon leads the group who oppose the king. Gideon&#x27;s assassination attempt on King Noah is interrupted by a Lamanite invasion. Noah leads a group of his men out of the land of Nephi, his priests among them, leaving their wives and children behind at Noah&#x27;s command. The remaining Nephites are captured by the Lamanite people and taxed, and Noah&#x27;s son, Limhi, is made their king. Noah&#x27;s group turns on him and his priests after Noah forbids them to return to their families. They burn King Noah at the stake, ultimately fulfilling Abinadi&#x27;s final prophecy that Noah will die as he did.

== Interpretation ==
Grant Hardy, a professor of religious studies, rejects the idea of Noah as the &quot;embodiment of aggressive evil.&quot; He instead identifies Noah&#x27;s character as lazy, greedy, and non-confrontational. Hardy argues that Noah&#x27;s &quot;vices&quot; were a result of having a &quot;nonjudgmental, tender-hearted, overly optimistic father.&quot; Political scientist Ryan Davis, writing for the &quot;Journal of Book of Mormon Studies&quot; labels the story of King Noah&#x27;s reign as a characteristic example of a &quot;despotic, autocratic regime.&quot;

== Cultural reception ==

Latter-day Saints often call King Noah a &quot;wicked king&quot;.

=== Art ===

A painting by American artist Arnold Friberg titled &quot;Abinadi Before King Noah&quot; visualizes Abinadi&#x27;s trial before Noah and his priests in the Book of Mosiah. Friberg&#x27;s &quot;Abinadi Before King Noah&quot; was part of a series consisting of twelve scenes from the Book of Mormon which were later included in published editions of the Book of Mormon. Noel Carmack states that Friberg&#x27;s Book of Mormon paintings have contributed to Latter-day Saint perceptions of people and stories within the Book of Mormon.

According to art historian and professor Darren Longman, Friberg&#x27;s imagining of this scene between King Noah and Abinadi follows an &quot;ethnocentric&quot; narrative where &quot;whiteness is tantamount to righteousness and brownness to iniquity.&quot; Longman quotes Dr. Anthony Sweat, an artist and professor of Church History and Doctrine, who described Friberg&#x27;s painting as &quot;an image with such influence and widespread distribution that it has shaped these artistic interpretations into almost certain facts for an entire generation of church members.&quot;

<text>Columbia Games is one of the oldest manufacturers of board wargames, and has also produced the &quot;Hârn&quot; role-playing game as well as various card games and collectible card games. Their wargames are notable for using small wooden or plastic blocks instead of the more conventional cardboard counters. The company, originally titled Gamma Two Games, started in Vancouver, Canada, but after ten years changed its name to Columbia Games, and eventually moved to Blaine, Washington. It is currently run by founder Tom Dalgliesh and his son Grant.
== Gamma Two Games ==
In 1971, Tom Dalgliesh, Lance Gutteridge and Steve Brewster all graduated from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, and decided to start a Canadian games company called Gamma Two Games. They published their first game in 1972, the block wargame titled &quot;Quebec 1759&quot;. Brewster left the company soon after its formation, and was replaced by Ron Gibson.

The company produced two more wargames, &quot;War of 1812&quot; in 1973, and &quot;Napoléon: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815&quot; in 1974.

Although &quot;Quebec 1759&quot; eventually sold over 20,000 copies, the next two titles were not as successful, and the business partners realized there was not much of a market in Canada for board wargames. Starting in 1975, they switched to more family-oriented games such as &quot;Airline&quot; (1975), &quot;Klondike&quot; (1975), &quot;Supermoney&quot; (1978), &quot;Smokers Wild&quot; (1978), &quot;Foreign Exchange&quot; (1978), &quot;Maneuver&quot; (1979), and &quot;Score! Soccer Game&quot; (1980).

==Columbia Games==
In 1982, the partners changed the company name to Columbia Games. The following year, Columbia entered the role-playing games market with &quot;Hârn&quot;, designed by N. Robin Crossby. In the mid-1980s, both Gutteridge and Gibson left the company, leaving Dalgliesh as the sole owner. In 1986, Dalgliesh moved the company just across the American border to Blaine, Washington, where the company could do an efficient mail order business to the much larger American market without the expense of cross-border customs and duties.

The company is still based in Blaine, and Dalgliesh&#x27;s son Grant is now a member of the company.

The company produces three main types of games:
*Block wargames
*Role-playing games
*Collectible card games (CCGs) and card games 

== Block wargames ==
Gamma Two&#x27;s first game, &quot;Quebec 1759&quot;, used embossed wooden blocks rather than cardboard chits. The design proved successful, and after the move to the United States, Columbia designed many more block wargames. Some of these games are designed to introduce new players to the wargaming hobby, but considerably more complex games have been produced, such as &quot;EuroFront&quot;, a wargame depicting the entirety of World War II in Europe. The relatively expensive embossed wooden blocks originally used in the games have been replaced by plain plastic blocks. Each game comes with a sheet of stickers to affix to the front of the blocks. 

Columbia&#x27;s list of block games includes:
*&quot;Quebec 1759&quot;, simulating the Battle of the Plains of Abraham during the French and Indian War
*&quot;War of 1812&quot; (1973), a game based on the War of 1812

*&quot;Rommel in the Desert&quot; (1982)
*&quot;EastFront&quot; — the entire Eastern Front of World War II (First edition 1991, and Second Edition 2006)
*&quot;WestFront: The War in Europe, 1943-45&quot; (1992)
*&quot;Bobby Lee: The Civil War in Virginia 1861-1865&quot; (1993) 
*&quot;MedFront: War in North Africa 1940-43&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Eurofront: War in Europe, 1936-45&quot; (First edition 1995, Second Edition 2006)
*&quot;Sam Grant: The Civil War in the West 1862-1864&quot; (1997)
*&quot;Victory: The Blocks of War&quot; (1998), a generic World War II strategic, combined arms game
*&quot;Wizard Kings&quot; (2000), — fantasy armies and creatures warring at the strategic level
*&quot;Pacific Victory: War in the Pacific 1941-45&quot; (First edition 2000, Second edition 2018)
* &quot;Hammer of the Scots&quot; (2002) — English invasions of Scotland
*&quot;Liberty: The American Revolution 1775-83&quot; (2003)
* &quot;Gettysburg: Badges of Courage&quot; (2004) American Civil War
*&quot;Crusader Rex&quot; (2005) — the 3rd Crusade. 
*&quot;Athens &amp; Sparta&quot; (2007) — the Peloponnesian War
*&quot;Texas Glory&quot; (2008), — Texan War of Independence, including the Battle of the Alamo
*&quot;Richard III: The Wars of the Roses&quot; (2009)
*&quot;Shiloh: April Glory&quot; (2010)
*&quot;Julius Caesar: Caesar, Pompey, and the Roman Civil War&quot; (2010)
*&quot;Shenandoah: Jackson&#x27;s Valley Campaign&quot; (2011)
*&quot;Borodino: Napoleon in Russia, 1812&quot; (2012)
*&quot;The Last Spike&quot; (2015) — completing the First transcontinental railroad
*&quot;Victory in Europe&quot; (2015) — the European Theater of World War II
*&quot;Combat Infantry: WestFront 1944-45&quot; (2017) and &quot;Combat Infantry: EastFront 1941-43&quot; (2019) — platoon tactics during World War II

== Role-playing games==

In 1983, Columbia published &quot;Hârn&quot;, a low-magic fantasy role-playing game campaign setting created by Robin Crossby. The &quot;Hârn&quot; product line is compatible with &quot;Hârn&quot; products produced by Kelestia Productions (Crossby&#x27;s own company) and is supported by additional material produced by the game&#x27;s fans.

It publishes a set of supplemental materials called &quot;HârnQuest&quot;. Each issue is approximately 32 pages and includes articles about Hârnic kingdoms, cities, castles, history, creatures, and other gaming topics. New Hârn Atlas maps are also sent under this subscription as they are released.

Columbia also published the &quot;Lionheart&quot; supplement in 1987.

== Card games ==
In the late 1990s, the company began producing collectible card games based upon military themes for the American Civil War (such as &quot;Dixie&quot;) and the Napoleonic Wars (&quot;Eagles: Waterloo&quot;).

&quot;Slapshot&quot; is a card game that focuses on managing a hockey team. Players trade, take, draw new team members and attempt to challenge opponents when they feel their opponents are weak. It is not necessary to know much about hockey to play.

<text>Académie militaire de Saint-Cyr Coëtquidan (, , abbr. AMSCC) is a French military educational facility located in the Morbihan department of Brittany in France. It forms a part of the commune of Guer and covers an area of approximately 64 km2.

It comprises: 
* École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr (ESM)
* École militaire interarmes (EMIA) (combined arms school)
* École militaire des aspirants de Coëtquidan (EMAC)

== World War I ==
Beginning in June–July 1917 the camp was temporarily transferred to the American Expeditionary Forces for use as an artillery training center. Field artillery brigades trained there included the 3rd (3rd Division), 51st (26th Division), 55th (30th Division), 56th (31st Division), 57th (32nd Division), 60th (35th Division), 61st (36th Division), 64th (39th Division), 67th (42nd Division), 158th (83rd Division), and the 160th (85th Division).

==World War II==
During the war, Coëtquidan was the main army camp used by the Polish Army formed on French soil in September 1939. It furnished the Polish Independent Highland Rifle Brigade that operated in Norway and then briefly in Brittany under General Bohusz-Szyszko in April–June 1940. It also furnished the 1st Grenadier Division that operated on the Lorraine front under General Duch in May–June 1940. In addition it began the training of armoured units that would be sent to the Bollène area in the south of France before being used to form the 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade that operated in the Marne–Côte-d’Or area under General Maczek in June 1940.

<text>Darren Arthur &quot;Dizzy&quot; Reed (born June 18, 1963) is an American musician. He is best known as the keyboardist for the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he has played, toured, and recorded since 1990.

Aside from lead singer Axl Rose, Reed is the longest-standing member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, and was the only member of the band to remain from their &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; era until the 2016 return of guitarist Slash and bass guitarist Duff McKagan. 

In 2012, Reed was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, although he did not attend the ceremony. He was also a member of the Australian-American supergroup The Dead Daisies with his Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmate Richard Fortus, ex-Whitesnake member Marco Mendoza, ex-Mötley Crüe frontman John Corabi and session drummer Brian Tichy.

==Early life==
Reed was born as Darren Arthur Reed on June 18, 1963, in Hinsdale, Illinois, and was raised in Colorado. Reed was described as reclusive and introverted, however he has since denied this. His grandmother began teaching him to play the organ when he was a young child, and before he was out of elementary school, he formed small local bands.

==Music career==

As an adult, Reed pursued a music career in Los Angeles. He was a founding member of the club band The Wild in the late 1980s, with whom he spent five years.

Reed met the classic lineup of Guns N&#x27; Roses in 1985 while his band, The Wild, rehearsed in a neighboring studio. He kept in touch, and in 1990 was invited by friend Axl Rose to join their recording of the two &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; albums and their subsequent tour.

Reed soon became an accepted member of the group and appeared on every album from &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; onward. As a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Reed has become well known for his keyboard, piano, and backing vocal work on such songs as &quot;Estranged&quot;, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;November Rain&quot;, &quot;Garden of Eden&quot;, &quot;Civil War&quot;, &quot;Yesterdays&quot;, and &quot;Knockin&#x27; On Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;. In addition to playing keyboards or piano, Reed frequently provides backup on percussion and vocals during live Guns N&#x27; Roses performances of older songs, such as &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot;, &quot;Nightrain&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Rocket Queen&quot;.

Reed continues to record and play live with the current Guns N&#x27; Roses line-up, and has now been a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses longer than any other member besides Axl Rose. Although Reed did not co-write any songs during the &quot;Illusion&quot; sessions, for &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot; he co-wrote &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;Street of Dreams&quot;, &quot;There Was a Time&quot;, &quot;I.R.S&quot;, and &quot;Oh My God&quot;. It has also been confirmed that the unfinished demo that did not make the cut on &quot;Chinese Democracy&quot;, called &quot;Silkworms&quot;, was written by Reed and the band&#x27;s other keyboardist Chris Pitman. The song was re-worked and released as a single under the title &quot;ABSUЯD&quot; in 2021.

===Work outside Guns N&#x27; Roses===

Outside of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Reed played on albums for his former bandmates Slash, Duff McKagan, and Gilby Clarke. He also guested on former Guns N&#x27; Roses bassist Tommy Stinson&#x27;s 2004 solo effort &quot;Village Gorilla Head&quot;. Reed is additionally a fan of Larry Norman, a pioneer of Christian music, and played on Norman&#x27;s &quot;Copper Wires&quot; album. He has composed music for the film scores &quot;The Still Life&quot;, released in 2006, and &quot;Celebrity Art Show&quot; (2008). His debut solo album was released on February 16, 2018.

When he is not touring or recording with Guns N&#x27; Roses, Reed frequently tours with his hard rock cover band Hookers &amp; Blow, in which he plays keyboard and sings lead vocals. Hookers &amp; Blow was formed in 2003 by Reed and Quiet Riot guitarist Alex Grossi. The Hookers &amp; Blow lineup also consists of former Type O Negative and current Danzig and Quiet Riot drummer Johnny Kelly, W.A.S.P. bassist Mike Duda and Dizzy&#x27;s wife Nadja. For his work with Hookers &amp; Blow, Reed was named Outstanding Keyboardist of the Year at the 2007 Rock City Awards (&quot;Rockies&quot;). Hookers &amp; Blow was also named Best Cover Band.

Reed has also dabbled in acting, appearing as &#x27;Mumbles&#x27; in the 2005 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Death Wish&quot;.

Reed was a member of The Dead Daisies alongside Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Richard Fortus. Both left the band in 2015 to focus on Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Reed played keyboard on the 2019 album &quot;You&#x27;re Welcome&quot; by Cokie The Clown, a solo effort by NOFX frontman Fat Mike.

==Personal life==
Reed was married for 20 years to wife Lisa, a stripper. They divorced in 2010.They have two daughters: Skye, born in 1992 and Shade, born in 1996. He also has a daughter named Morgan and one son (Justin Gunn-Reed born in 1988) from a previous relationship. In 2017, he also had a grandson, Riley, who is Morgan&#x27;s son.

In 2005, Reed took the unusual step of seeking admission to a college fraternity well after the traditional age of inductees, and on January 22, 2006, was admitted to the Cornell University chapter of Zeta Psi.

<doc id="625395" wikidata="Q111648" url="?curid=625395" title="Battle of Stony Point">
<text>The Battle of Stony Point took place on July 16, 1779, during the American Revolutionary War. In a well-planned and -executed nighttime attack, a highly trained select group of George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army troops under the command of Brigadier General &quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne defeated British troops in a quick and daring assault on their outpost in Stony Point, New York, approximately north of New York City.

The British suffered heavy losses in a battle that served as an important victory in terms of morale for the Continental Army. While the fort was ordered evacuated quickly after the battle by General Washington, this key crossing site was used later in the war by units of the Continental Army to cross the Hudson River on their way to victory over the British.

==Background==

Following the surrender of General John Burgoyne after the Battles of Saratoga in October 1777 and the subsequent entry of France into the war as an American ally, British strategy in dealing with the rebellious Americans was forced to change. In the northern states, their strategy was reduced to raids against targets of economic and military importance, and unsuccessful attempts to bring General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army into a decisive confrontation. Washington deployed his army in strong positions around the principal British base at New York City, and refused to be drawn out of them.

British military plans for 1779 were large in ambition, but were ultimately hampered, in the opinion of their North American commander in chief, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton, by shortages of manpower, and delays in the arrival of manpower that was promised for the campaign. Clinton sought to force Washington to weaken the Continental Army camp at Middlebrook in northern New Jersey, after which he would march in force out of New York and capture it. This, Clinton believed, would threaten Washington&#x27;s supply lines, drawing him out of the highlands on the Hudson River into more favorable terrain for a general engagement.

===British dispositions===
In late May 1779, General Clinton led a force of about 8,000 men up the North (or Hudson) River as the opening move in this strategy. The British strategists realized that the Stony Point location represented a vital area that controlled that portion of the Hudson River and the entrance to the Hudson Highlands, as well as the nearby Kings Ferry crossing. Because of this they decided to assault it. General Clinton, with approximately 6,000 British, Loyalist, and Hessian soldiers under his command sailed up the Hudson, transported by the Royal Navy and landed unopposed.

Stony Point was defended by a meager force totaling around 40 American Patriots, and before escaping to the north the small garrison set fire to the wooden blockhouse that was the unfinished fort built atop Stony Point. The British forces, in order to capture nearby Fort Lafayette, hauled several cannons up the steep and rugged slopes of Stony Point and used the vantage point to shell Fort Lafayette. This move effectively closed King&#x27;s Ferry, a major river crossing at that narrow point in the river, about south of West Point and north of New York City.

While he waited for reinforcements to arrive so that he might march on Middlebrook, Clinton dispatched William Tryon and more than 2,000 troops on a raiding expedition in early July against coastal communities in Connecticut, claiming in retrospect that its purpose was to draw Washington&#x27;s troops further east. Clinton reduced the garrisons at Stony Point and Verplanck&#x27;s Point for the operation, which failed to draw Washington out of his camps.

Stony Point was garrisoned with elements of the 17th Regiment of Foot under the command of Lt. Col. Henry Johnson. The 17th was reinforced by a grenadier company belonging to one of the two battalions of the 71st Regiment, and a company-strength detachment of the Loyal American Regiment. A detachment of the Royal Artillery manned fifteen field pieces that included five iron and two brass cannon, four mortars and four small howitzers. A Royal Navy gunboat was assigned to protect the river approaches to the fortifications, and the armed sloop &quot;Vulture&quot; was also anchored in that part of the river.

Washington observed construction of the fortifications through a telescope from atop nearby Buckberg Mountain. Historians also believe he used intelligence gathered from local merchants to get a better idea of the strength of the garrison, the types of watchwords in use, and the placement of sentries – especially on the south side of the point, which could not be seen from Buckberg. During this time he formulated a plan of attack and selected a commander to lead it – Brigadier General Anthony Wayne, commander of the Pennsylvania Line.

The British position at Stony Point was a fortified one, but it was never intended to be a true fort in the 18th century European sense of the word. No stone was used and no walls were constructed. The defenses consisted of earthen fleches (cannon positions) and wooden abatis (felled trees sharpened to a point and placed in earthen embankments). The defenses were situated on a rocky elevation approachable only from the west, protected in the front by a watery defile and on both flanks by extensive swampy areas.

===American forces and tactics===

To storm the position, the Corps of Light Infantry was formed on June 12, with command assigned to General Wayne. The Corps of Light Infantry was an elite, seasonal combat organization drafted in each of the years between 1777 and 1781 from the light infantry companies of each regiment in Washington&#x27;s army. The 1779 Corps was organized into a brigade of four regiments, each composed of two battalions of four companies, with the following order of battle:
*1st Regiment, commanded by Col. Christian Febiger of the 2nd Virginia Regiment: six companies of Virginia and two of Pennsylvania troops
*2nd Regiment, Col. Richard Butler (9th Pennsylvania Regiment): four companies each of Pennsylvanians and of Marylanders;
*3rd Regiment, Col. Return Jonathan Meigs (6th Connecticut Regiment): eight companies of Connecticut troops
*4th Regiment, a partially organized detachment of six companies of Massachusetts troops and two of North Carolina, temporarily commanded by Major William Hull (8th Massachusetts Regiment). The 4th Regiment was fully organized in August and assigned to the command of Col. Rufus Putnam.

The plan called for a night attack on the fortifications to be carried out by the 1,350 men of the corps. Each regiment consisted of 300 to 340 men, and the total force included an artillery detachment to man captured British field pieces. According to 18th century military doctrine, this was not enough men to take a well-prepared defensive position, but in addition to the element of surprise, Washington&#x27;s plan exploited a fatal flaw in the fortifications.

The wooden abatis along the southern shore of the point were not extended into the deep water of the Hudson and could be outflanked by attackers along a narrow beach at low tide. The main attack would be along this approach, but Washington advised that if practicable, secondary and diversionary attacks could also be made along the north shore of the point and across the causeway to the center.

Washington gave Wayne his instructions, along with permission to modify the plan as necessary. This was an unusual act for Washington, and indicates the high opinion he had of Wayne&#x27;s tactical abilities. The assault would be difficult: it would be carried out in the dead of night, called for the men to scale the steep, rocky sides of Stony Point, and required surprise. To accomplish this last element, Washington ordered that the men carry unloaded muskets and attack using only bayonets to maintain silence, a tactic often employed by the British army, and had been used to devastating effect against Wayne two years prior at Paoli.

The exception to loaded weaponry were the two companies of North Carolina light infantry, which Wayne ordered to cross the causeway, and stage a demonstration attack at the center of the British defenses, where the British expected an attack to come. This battalion, commanded by Maj. Hardy Murfree, was instructed to lay down a &quot;gauling fire&quot; with their weapons as a diversionary tactic.

Wayne selected Butler&#x27;s 2nd Regiment of approximately 300 men to conduct an assault along the northern shore of the point, while Wayne himself would lead the main column in the south, consisting of the 1st and 3rd Regiments, and Hull&#x27;s detachment of Massachusetts light infantry. The columns deployed an advance force of 100 and 150 men respectively wielding axes to clear obstacles, with 20 men from each advance force assigned as the forlorn hopes, to protect the force and to be the first to enter the works. Wayne announced that he would give prize bounties to the first men who entered the works, and to anyone else who distinguished himself in the action.

==Battle==

After a morning muster, on July 15, the Corps of Light Infantry marched from Sandy Beach north of Fort Montgomery beginning at noon. Any civilians met along the route of march were to be taken into custody to prevent them from warning the British. The column, often forced to march single file over rough terrain and roads hardly more than paths, took a circuitous route west through Queensboro to the west and over Dunderberg Mountain to avoid detection by the British. The Corps began arriving at 8 p.m. at the Springsteel farm, a mile and a half (2 km) west of the fortifications, and by 10 p.m. had been formed in the attack columns.

The men were given a rum ration and their orders. They were also given pieces of white paper to pin to their hats in order to help them tell each other from the British in the darkness. The columns then moved out at 11:30 p.m. to their jump-off points, diverging immediately, to begin the assault at midnight. These attack columns were led by groups of volunteer soldiers nicknamed the &quot;forlorn hope&quot; who were responsible for breaking holes in enemy defenses and along with their weapons, were armed with axes and picks.

Bad weather that night aided the Continentals. Cloud cover cut off moonlight and high winds forced the British ships in Haverstraw Bay to leave their posts off Stony Point and move downriver. At midnight, as scheduled, the attack began with the columns crossing the swampy flanks of the point. The southern column unexpectedly found its approach inundated in two to four feet of water and required thirty minutes to wade to the first line of abatis, during which it and Murfree&#x27;s demonstration force were spotted by British sentries and fired upon.

Under fire Wayne&#x27;s column succeeded in getting inside the British first line of defenses. Wayne himself was struck in the head by a spent musket ball and fell to the ground, leaving Col. Febiger to take over command of Wayne&#x27;s column. Meanwhile, Butler&#x27;s column had succeeded in cutting its way through the abatis, sustaining the only loss of life on the American side while doing so. The two columns penetrated the British line almost simultaneously and seized the summit when six companies of the 17th Regiment of Foot took positions opposite the diversionary attack and were cut off.

Because of the stealth in which the Patriot assault forces approached the British defenses on the slopes of the hill, the artillery pieces that the British had placed on the summit for just such defensive purposes were unsuccessful in repelling the attack. Due to the speed at which the Patriot infantrymen were moving, the British cannons could not be lowered to an angle low enough to sufficiently harass the men assaulting up the hill.

The first man into the British upper works was Lt. Col. Francois de Fleury, an aristocrat French engineer commanding a battalion of the 1st Regiment. He was followed by Lt. Henry Knox, Sgt. William Baker, Sgt William Spencer and Sgt. George Donlop. As the men entered the British works they called out, &quot;The fort&#x27;s our own!&quot; – the prearranged watchword to distinguish friend from foe. The action lasted 25 minutes and was over by 1 a.m.

Wayne&#x27;s losses were 15 killed and 83 wounded. 546 prisoners were taken, 74 of whom were wounded. Some Patriot sources stated that there were 63 British dead but military historian Mark M. Boatner accepts the official British report of 20 killed. However, the report (from Lt-Col. Johnson to Sir Henry Clinton on July 24) also lists 58 missing separate from killed, wounded, and captured, many of whom may have drowned in the Hudson.

Before dawn, Wayne sent a brief dispatch telling Washington, &quot;The fort and garrison, with Colonel Johnston, are ours. Our officers and men behaved like men who are determined to be free.&quot; The next day, Washington rode into the works to inspect the battlefield and congratulate the troops. For his exploits, Wayne was awarded a medal by Congress, one of the few issued during the revolution.

==Aftermath==
While the strategic value of capturing Stony Point was up for debate, it was regardless, a huge victory for morale for the Continental Army. Its minimal strategic value was that it asserted Washington&#x27;s foothold on the nearby West Point. Washington visited the battle site on the 17th of July, and applauded the men responsible for its capture after viewing the harsh terrain that was traversed by the assaulting forces.

Washington&#x27;s instructions to Wayne had allowed for the possibility of an assault on Verplanck&#x27;s Point once Stony Point was taken. As part of the attack on Stony Point, Washington had directed two brigades to begin moving toward Verplanck&#x27;s, and dispatched Colonel Rufus Putnam with a small force to divert the attention of its British garrison. Putnam was able to begin diversionary fire against Verplanck&#x27;s shortly after the assault on Stony Point began, and he successfully distracted the British until morning.

On the morning of the 16th Wayne&#x27;s forces turned Stony Point&#x27;s cannons against Verplanck&#x27;s, but the fire at long range did no significant damage. The fire was sufficient, however, to prompt the &quot;Vulture&quot; to cut her anchor and drift downstream. Washington then sent General Robert Howe to lead the two brigades to besiege Verplanck&#x27;s on the 17th, but the force was not provisioned with adequate artillery or siege equipment, and could do little more than blockade the fort. On the 18th some British troops were landed from ships sent upriver, and more were rumored to be coming overland, so Howe decided to withdraw.

Washington had not intended to hold either point, and Stony Point was abandoned by the Americans on July 18, after carrying off the captured cannons and supplies. The British briefly reoccupied the site only to abandon it in October, as General Clinton prepared a major expedition to the southern states.

Some of the captured officers were exchanged immediately after the battle, but the more than 400 prisoners of other ranks were marched off to a prison camp at Easton, Pennsylvania. An unsuccessful attempt by a small number of prisoners on July 17 to overpower their captors resulted in one British sergeant killed and about 20 other ranks wounded.

Contemporary Patriot accounts note that Wayne had given quarter to the garrison of Stony Point despite the alleged treatment of his own men at the &quot;Paoli Massacre&quot; in 1777. British reports also remarked that unanticipated clemency was immediately shown the garrison.
Because of the relative ease with which the Continental Army took over the fort however, the British commander of Stony Point, Colonel Johnson, was court martialed in New York City with accusations against him of inadequate defense.

===Geography===

Situated about 30 miles north of New York City, the location of the fort at Stony Point was a vital place in terms of control of the lower Hudson River, as well as control over the major ferry crossing known as Kings Ferry, which crossed between Stony Point and Verplanck&#x27;s Point. This ferry crossing was of key importance to both sides as it was a main point for the exchange of trade and supplies from New England to the rest of the colonies.

Twelve miles north of Stony Point was West Point. This made the fort even more vital to the security of that region. West Point was a strategic fortification to General George Washington&#x27;s Continental Army as the fortress and defenses there were vital in keeping control over the upper reaches of the Hudson River.

A roughly triangular promontory jutting into the Hudson river just below Peekskill, New York, with steep rocky slopes rising up to a 150-foot summit, Stony Point boasts formidable natural defenses. This made assaulting the position such a daunting task and prompted the nickname &#x27;Little Gibraltar&#x27;.

At the time of the battle, Stony Point was virtually an island, surrounded by water on all sides but the west, where a swampy area all but severed the Point from dry land. Today the swamp is now mostly dry, but otherwise the position is relatively unchanged, apart from a lighthouse and a museum with other State Park structures atop the hill.

===Battlefield preservation===
The Stony Point State Historic Site preserves the battlefield and has interpretive materials, tours, and demonstrations, primarily during the summer season. A museum on the site features artifacts from the battle, including a howitzer and two mortars. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.
Many of the original man made defenses built by the British still exist today. Markers and memorials commemorate certain sights and locations of key battles atop the fortress. The slopes leading up to the summit, which at the time of the battle were stripped of all foliage and vegetation for maximum defensive fields of fire, are now overgrown with vegetation.

===In media===

A fictionalized version of the battle is featured in season three of the AMC television series . The battle is incorrectly depicted as taking place during wintertime rather than summertime and the Americans are led by Major Benjamin Talmadge rather than General Anthony Wayne.

<text>Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld (; ; 21 October 1921 – 30 March 2015) was a Dutch astronomer.

==Background==
In a jointly credited trio with Tom Gehrels and her husband Cornelis Johannes van Houten, she was the discoverer of many thousands of asteroids (credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 4,641 numbered minor planets). In the Palomar–Leiden survey, Gehrels took the images using the 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory and shipped the photographic plates to the van Houtens at Leiden Observatory, who analyzed them for new asteroids. The trio are jointly credited with several thousand asteroid discoveries. Van Houten-Groeneveld died on 30 March 2015, at the age of 93, in Oegstgeest, Netherlands.

The Themistian main-belt asteroid 1674 Groeneveld – discovered by Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg and independently discovered by Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä in 1938, was named in her honor ().

<text>Stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to a part of the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.

Signs and symptoms of stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred. If symptoms last less than 24 hours, the stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), also called a mini-stroke. Hemorrhagic stroke may also be associated with a severe headache. The symptoms of stroke can be permanent. Long-term complications may include pneumonia and loss of bladder control.
The most significant risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Other risk factors include high blood cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, a previous TIA, end-stage kidney disease, and atrial fibrillation. Ischemic stroke is typically caused by blockage of a blood vessel, though there are also less common causes. Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by either bleeding directly into the brain or into the space between the brain&#x27;s membranes. Bleeding may occur due to a ruptured brain aneurysm. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam and supported by medical imaging such as a CT scan or MRI scan. A CT scan can rule out bleeding, but may not necessarily rule out ischemia, which early on typically does not show up on a CT scan. Other tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood tests are done to determine risk factors and possible causes. Low blood sugar may cause similar symptoms.
Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and anticoagulant medication in people with atrial fibrillation. Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention. Stroke is a medical emergency. Ischemic strokes, if detected within three to four-and-a-half hours, may be treatable with medication that can break down the clot, while hemorrhagic strokes sometimes benefit from surgery. Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.
In 2023, 15 million people worldwide had a stroke. In 2021, stroke was the third biggest cause of death, responsible for approximately 10% of total deaths. In 2015, there were about 42.4 million people who had previously had stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the annual incidence of stroke decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world, but increased by 10% in the developing world. In 2015, stroke was the second most frequent cause of death after coronary artery disease, accounting for 6.3 million deaths (11% of the total). About 3.0 million deaths resulted from ischemic stroke while 3.3 million deaths resulted from hemorrhagic stroke. About half of people who have had a stroke live less than one year. Overall, two thirds of cases of stroke occurred in those over 65 years old.
==Classification==

Stroke can be classified into two major categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is caused by interruption of the blood supply to the brain, while hemorrhagic stroke results from the rupture of a blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure.

About 87% of stroke is ischemic, with the rest being hemorrhagic. Bleeding can develop inside areas of ischemia, a condition known as &quot;hemorrhagic transformation.&quot; It is unknown how many cases of hemorrhagic stroke actually start as ischemic stroke.

===Definition===
In the 1970s the World Health Organization defined &quot;stroke&quot; as a &quot;neurological deficit of cerebrovascular cause that persists beyond 24 hours or is interrupted by death within 24 hours&quot;, although the word &quot;stroke&quot; is centuries old. This definition was supposed to reflect the reversibility of tissue damage and was devised for the purpose, with the time frame of 24 hours being chosen arbitrarily. The 24-hour limit divides stroke from transient ischemic attack, which is a related syndrome of stroke symptoms that resolve completely within 24 hours. With the availability of treatments that can reduce stroke severity when given early, many now prefer alternative terminology, such as &quot;brain attack&quot; and &quot;acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome&quot; (modeled after heart attack and acute coronary syndrome, respectively), to reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly.

===Ischemic===
During ischemic stroke, blood supply to part of the brain is decreased, leading to dysfunction of the brain tissue in that area. There are four reasons why this might happen:

# Thrombosis (obstruction of a blood vessel by a blood clot forming locally)
# Embolism (obstruction due to an embolus from elsewhere in the body),
# Systemic hypoperfusion (general decrease in blood supply, e.g., in shock)
# Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.

Stroke without an obvious explanation is termed cryptogenic stroke (idiopathic); this constitutes 30–40% of all cases of ischemic stroke.

There are classification systems for acute ischemic stroke. The Oxford Community Stroke Project classification (OCSP, also known as the Bamford or Oxford classification) relies primarily on the initial symptoms; based on the extent of the symptoms, the stroke episode is classified as total anterior circulation infarct (TACI), partial anterior circulation infarct (PACI), lacunar infarct (LACI) or posterior circulation infarct (POCI). These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis.

The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, stroke is classified as being due to

(1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery,

(2) an embolism originating in the heart,

(3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel,

(4) other determined cause,

(5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation).

Users of stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine are at a high risk for ischemic stroke.

===Hemorrhagic===

There are two main types of hemorrhagic stroke:
* Intracerebral hemorrhage, which is bleeding within the brain itself (when an artery in the brain bursts, flooding the surrounding tissue with blood), due to either intraparenchymal hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain tissue) or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain&#x27;s ventricular system).
* Subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is bleeding that occurs outside of the brain tissue but still within the skull, and precisely between the arachnoid mater and pia mater (the delicate &quot;innermost&quot; layer of the three layers of the meninges that surround the brain).
The above two main types of hemorrhagic stroke are also two different forms of intracranial hemorrhage, which is the accumulation of blood anywhere within the cranial vault; but the other forms of intracranial hemorrhage, such as epidural hematoma (bleeding between the skull and the dura mater, which is the thick &quot;outermost&quot; layer of the meninges that surround the brain) and subdural hematoma (bleeding in the subdural space), are not considered &quot;hemorrhagic stroke&quot;.

Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In addition to neurological impairment, hemorrhagic stroke usually causes specific symptoms (for instance, subarachnoid hemorrhage classically causes a severe headache known as a thunderclap headache) or reveal evidence of a previous head injury.

==Signs and symptoms==
Stroke may be preceded by premonitory symptoms, which may indicate a stroke is imminent. These symptoms may include dizziness, dysarthria (speech disorder), exhaustion, hemiparesis (weakness on one side of the body), paresthesia (tingling, pricking, chilling, burning, numbness of the skin), pathological laughter, seizure that turns into paralysis, &quot;thunderclap&quot; headache, or vomiting. Premonitory symptoms are not diagnostic of a stroke, and may be a sign of other illness. Assessing onset (gradual or sudden), duration, and the presence of other associated symptoms are important, and premonitory symptoms may not appear at all or may vary depending on the type of stroke.

Stroke symptoms typically start suddenly, over seconds to minutes, and in most cases do not progress further. The symptoms depend on the area of the brain affected. The more extensive the area of the brain affected, the more functions that are likely to be lost. Some forms of stroke can cause additional symptoms. For example, in intracranial hemorrhage, the affected area may compress other structures. Most forms of stroke are not associated with a headache, apart from subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis and occasionally intracerebral hemorrhage.

===Early recognition===
Systems have been proposed to increase recognition of stroke. Sudden-onset face weakness, arm drift (i.e., if a person, when asked to raise both arms, involuntarily lets one arm drift downward) and abnormal speech are the findings most likely to lead to the correct identification of a case of stroke, increasing the likelihood by 5.5 when at least one of these is present. Similarly, when all three of these are absent, the likelihood of stroke is decreased (– likelihood ratio of 0.39). While these findings are not perfect for diagnosing stroke, the fact that they can be evaluated relatively rapidly and easily make them very valuable in the acute setting.

A mnemonic to remember the warning signs of stroke is FAST (facial droop, arm weakness, speech difficulty, and time to call emergency services), as advocated by the Department of Health (United Kingdom) and the Stroke Association, the American Stroke Association, and the National Stroke Association (US). FAST is less reliable in the recognition of posterior circulation stroke. The revised mnemonic &quot;BE FAST&quot;, which adds balance (sudden trouble keeping balance while walking or standing) and eyesight (new onset of blurry or double vision or sudden, painless loss of sight) to the assessment, has been proposed to address this shortcoming and improve early detection of stroke even further. Other scales for prehospital detection of stroke include the Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS) and the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS), on which the FAST method was based. Use of these scales is recommended by professional guidelines.

For people referred to the emergency room, early recognition of stroke is deemed important as this can expedite diagnostic tests and treatments. A scoring system called ROSIER (recognition of stroke in the emergency room) is recommended for this purpose; it is based on features from the medical history and physical examination.

===Associated symptoms===

Loss of consciousness, headache, and vomiting usually occur more often in hemorrhagic stroke than in thrombosis because of the increased intracranial pressure from the leaking blood compressing the brain.

If symptoms are maximal at onset, the cause is more likely to be a subarachnoid hemorrhage or an embolic stroke.

===Subtypes===
If the area of the brain affected includes one of the three prominent central nervous system pathways—the spinothalamic tract, corticospinal tract, and the dorsal column–medial lemniscus pathway, symptoms may include:
* hemiplegia and muscle weakness of the face
* numbness
* reduction in sensory or vibratory sensation
* initial flaccidity (reduced muscle tone), replaced by spasticity (increased muscle tone), excessive reflexes, and obligatory synergies.

In most cases, the symptoms affect only one side of the body (unilateral). The defect in the brain is &quot;usually&quot; on the opposite side of the body. However, since these pathways also travel in the spinal cord and any lesion there can also produce these symptoms, the presence of any one of these symptoms does not necessarily indicate stroke. In addition to the above central nervous system pathways, the brainstem gives rise to most of the twelve cranial nerves. A brainstem stroke affecting the brainstem and brain, therefore, can produce symptoms relating to deficits in these cranial nerves:
* altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision (total or partial)
* drooping of eyelid (ptosis) and weakness of ocular muscles
* decreased reflexes: gag, swallow, pupil reactivity to light
* decreased sensation and muscle weakness of the face
* balance problems and nystagmus
* altered breathing and heart rate
* weakness in sternocleidomastoid muscle with inability to turn head to one side
* weakness in tongue (inability to stick out the tongue or move it from side to side)

If the &quot;cerebral cortex&quot; is involved, the central nervous system pathways can again be affected, but can also produce the following symptoms:
* aphasia (difficulty with verbal expression, auditory comprehension, reading and writing; Broca&#x27;s or Wernicke&#x27;s area typically involved)
* dysarthria (motor speech disorder resulting from neurological injury)
* apraxia (altered voluntary movements)
* visual field defect
* memory deficits (involvement of temporal lobe)
* hemineglect (involvement of parietal lobe)
* disorganized thinking, confusion, hypersexual gestures (with involvement of frontal lobe)
* lack of insight of his or her, usually stroke-related, disability

If the &quot;cerebellum&quot; is involved, ataxia might be present and this includes:
* altered walking gait
* altered movement coordination
* vertigo and or disequilibrium

=== Preceding signs and symptoms ===
In the days before a stroke (generally in the previous 7 days, even the previous one), a considerable proportion of patients have a &quot;sentinel headache&quot;: a severe and unusual headache that indicates a problem. Its appearance makes it advisable to seek medical review and to consider prevention against stroke.

==Causes==

===Thrombotic stroke===

In thrombotic stroke, a thrombus (blood clot) usually forms around atherosclerotic plaques. Since blockage of the artery is gradual, onset of symptomatic thrombotic stroke is slower than that of hemorrhagic stroke. A thrombus itself (even if it does not completely block the blood vessel) can lead to an embolic stroke (see below) if the thrombus breaks off and travels in the bloodstream, at which point it is called an embolus. Two types of thrombosis can cause stroke:
* &quot;Large vessel disease&quot; involves the common and internal carotid arteries, the vertebral artery, and the Circle of Willis. Diseases that may form thrombi in the large vessels include (in descending incidence): atherosclerosis, vasoconstriction (tightening of the artery), aortic, carotid or vertebral artery dissection, inflammatory diseases of the blood vessel wall (Takayasu arteritis, giant cell arteritis, vasculitis), noninflammatory vasculopathy, Moyamoya disease and fibromuscular dysplasia. Strokes caused by artery dissections are in the strictest sense not always caused by a &#x27;defined disease state&#x27;, such events can occur in very young people and can be caused by physical injury such as hyperextension of the neck area or often by other forms of trauma.
* &quot;Small vessel disease&quot; involves the smaller arteries inside the brain: branches of the circle of Willis, middle cerebral artery, stem, and arteries arising from the distal vertebral and basilar artery. Diseases that may form thrombi in the small vessels include (in descending incidence): lipohyalinosis (build-up of fatty hyaline matter in the blood vessel as a result of high blood pressure and aging) and fibrinoid degeneration (stroke involving these vessels is known as a lacunar stroke) and microatheroma (small atherosclerotic plaques).

Anemia causes increase blood flow in the blood circulatory system. This causes the endothelial cells of the blood vessels to express adhesion factors which encourages the clotting of blood and formation of thrombus. Sickle-cell anemia, which can cause blood cells to clump up and block blood vessels, can also lead to stroke. Stroke is the second leading cause of death in people under 20 with sickle-cell anemia.

===Embolic stroke===
An embolic stroke refers to an arterial embolism (a blockage of an artery) by an embolus, a traveling particle or debris in the arterial bloodstream originating from elsewhere. An embolus is most frequently a thrombus, but it can also be a number of other substances including fat (e.g., from bone marrow in a broken bone), air, cancer cells or clumps of bacteria (usually from infectious endocarditis).

Because an embolus arises from elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily. Thus, the source of the embolus must be identified. Because the embolic blockage is sudden in onset, symptoms are usually maximal at the start. Also, symptoms may be transient as the embolus is partially resorbed and moves to a different location or dissipates altogether.

Emboli most commonly arise from the heart (especially in atrial fibrillation) but may originate from elsewhere in the arterial tree. In paradoxical embolism, a deep vein thrombosis embolizes through an atrial or ventricular septal defect in the heart into the brain.

Causes of stroke related to the heart can be distinguished between high- and low-risk:
* High risk: atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, rheumatic disease of the mitral or aortic valve disease, artificial heart valves, known cardiac thrombus of the atrium or ventricle, sick sinus syndrome, sustained atrial flutter, recent myocardial infarction, chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction &lt;28 percent, symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction &lt;30 percent, dilated cardiomyopathy, Libman-Sacks endocarditis, Marantic endocarditis, infective endocarditis, papillary fibroelastoma, left atrial myxoma, and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
* Low risk/potential: calcification of the annulus (ring) of the mitral valve, patent foramen ovale (PFO), atrial septal aneurysm, atrial septal aneurysm &quot;with&quot; patent foramen ovale, left ventricular aneurysm without thrombus, isolated left atrial &quot;smoke&quot; on echocardiography (no mitral stenosis or atrial fibrillation), and complex atheroma in the ascending aorta or proximal arch

Among those who have a complete blockage of one of the carotid arteries, the risk of stroke on that side is about one percent per year.

A special form of embolic stroke is the embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS). This subset of cryptogenic stroke is defined as a non-lacunar brain infarct without proximal arterial stenosis or cardioembolic sources. About one out of six cases of ischemic stroke could be classified as ESUS.

===Cerebral hypoperfusion===
Cerebral hypoperfusion is the reduction of blood flow to all parts of the brain. The reduction could be to a particular part of the brain depending on the cause. It is most commonly due to heart failure from cardiac arrest or arrhythmias, or from reduced cardiac output as a result of myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding. Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen content) may precipitate the hypoperfusion. Because the reduction in blood flow is global, all parts of the brain may be affected, especially vulnerable &quot;watershed&quot; areas—border zone regions supplied by the major cerebral arteries. A watershed stroke refers to the condition when the blood supply to these areas is compromised. Blood flow to these areas does not necessarily stop, but instead it may lessen to the point where brain damage can occur.

===Venous thrombosis===
Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis leads to stroke due to locally increased venous pressure, which exceeds the pressure generated by the arteries. Infarcts are more likely to undergo hemorrhagic transformation (leaking of blood into the damaged area) than other types of ischemic stroke.

===Intracerebral hemorrhage===
It generally occurs in small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to hypertension, intracranial vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or arteriovenous malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred. Other potential causes are trauma, bleeding disorders, amyloid angiopathy, illicit drug use (e.g., amphetamines or cocaine). The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the ventricular system, CSF or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain&#x27;s ventricles. ICH has a mortality rate of 44 percent after 30 days, higher than ischemic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage (which technically may also be classified as a type of stroke).

===Other===
Other causes may include spasm of an artery. This may occur due to cocaine. Cancer is also another well recognized potential cause of stroke. Although, malignancy in general can increase the risk of stroke, certain types of cancer such as pancreatic, lung and gastric are typically associated with a higher thromboembolism risk. The mechanism with which cancer increases stroke risk is thought to be secondary to an acquired hypercoagulability. Air pollution is responsible for around 27% of deaths from strokes worldwide, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study.

===Silent stroke===
Silent stroke is stroke that does not have any outward symptoms, and people are typically unaware they had experienced stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, silent stroke still damages the brain and places the person at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. Conversely, those who have had major stroke are also at risk of having silent stroke. In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or hemorrhages. Silent stroke typically causes lesions which are detected via the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. Silent stroke is estimated to occur at five times the rate of symptomatic stroke. The risk of silent stroke increases with age, but they may also affect younger adults and children, especially those with acute anemia.

==Pathophysiology==

===Ischemic===

Ischemic stroke occurs because of a loss of blood supply to part of the brain, initiating the ischemic cascade. Atherosclerosis may disrupt the blood supply by narrowing the lumen of blood vessels leading to a reduction of blood flow by causing the formation of blood clots within the vessel or by releasing showers of small emboli through the disintegration of atherosclerotic plaques. Embolic infarction occurs when emboli formed elsewhere in the circulatory system, typically in the heart as a consequence of atrial fibrillation, or in the carotid arteries, break off, enter the cerebral circulation, then lodge in and block brain blood vessels. Since blood vessels in the brain are now blocked, the brain becomes low in energy, and thus it resorts to using anaerobic metabolism within the region of brain tissue affected by ischemia. Anaerobic metabolism produces less adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but releases a by-product called lactic acid. Lactic acid is an irritant which could potentially destroy cells since it is an acid and disrupts the normal acid-base balance in the brain. The ischemia area is referred to as the &quot;ischemic penumbra&quot;. After the initial ischemic event the penumbra transitions from a tissue remodeling characterized by damage to a remodeling characterized by repair.

As oxygen or glucose becomes depleted in ischemic brain tissue, the production of high energy phosphate compounds such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) fails, leading to failure of energy-dependent processes (such as ion pumping) necessary for tissue cell survival. This sets off a series of interrelated events that result in cellular injury and death. A major cause of neuronal injury is the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. The concentration of glutamate outside the cells of the nervous system is normally kept low by so-called uptake carriers, which are powered by the concentration gradients of ions (mainly Na+) across the cell membrane. However, stroke cuts off the supply of oxygen and glucose which powers the ion pumps maintaining these gradients. As a result, the transmembrane ion gradients run down, and glutamate transporters reverse their direction, releasing glutamate into the extracellular space. Glutamate acts on receptors in nerve cells (especially NMDA receptors), producing an influx of calcium which activates enzymes that digest the cells&#x27; proteins, lipids, and nuclear material. Calcium influx can also lead to the failure of mitochondria, which can lead further toward energy depletion and may trigger cell death due to programmed cell death.

Ischemia also induces production of oxygen free radicals and other reactive oxygen species. These react with and damage a number of cellular and extracellular elements. Damage to the blood vessel lining or endothelium may occur. These processes are the same for any type of ischemic tissue and are referred to collectively as the &quot;ischemic cascade&quot;. However, brain tissue is especially vulnerable to ischemia since it has little respiratory reserve and is completely dependent on aerobic metabolism, unlike most other organs.

==== Collateral flow ====

The brain can compensate inadequate blood flow in a single artery by the collateral system. This system relies on the efficient connection between the carotid and vertebral arteries through the circle of Willis and, to a lesser extent, the major arteries supplying the cerebral hemispheres. However, variations in the circle of Willis, caliber of collateral vessels, and acquired arterial lesions such as atherosclerosis can disrupt this compensatory mechanism, increasing the risk of brain ischemia resulting from artery blockage.

The extent of damage depends on the duration and severity of the ischemia. If ischemia persists for more than 5 minutes with perfusion below 5% of normal, some neurons will die. However, if ischemia is mild, the damage will occur slowly and may take up to 6 hours to completely destroy the brain tissue. In case of severe ischemia lasting more than 15 to 30 minutes, all of the affected tissue will die, leading to infarction. The rate of damage is affected by temperature, with hyperthermia accelerating damage and hypothermia slowing it down and other factors. Prompt restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues can reduce or reverse injury, especially if the tissues are not yet irreversibly damaged. This is particularly important for the moderately ischemic areas (penumbras) surrounding areas of severe ischemia, which may still be salvageable due to collateral flow.

===Hemorrhagic===
Hemorrhagic stroke is classified based on their underlying pathology. Some causes of hemorrhagic stroke are hypertensive hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, ruptured AV fistula, transformation of prior ischemic infarction, and drug-induced bleeding. They result in tissue injury by causing compression of tissue from an expanding hematoma or hematomas. In addition, the pressure may lead to a loss of blood supply to affected tissue with resulting infarction, and the blood released by brain hemorrhage appears to have direct toxic effects on brain tissue and vasculature. Inflammation contributes to the secondary brain injury after hemorrhage.

==Diagnosis==

Stroke is diagnosed through several techniques: a neurological examination (such as the NIHSS), CT scans (most often without contrast enhancements) or MRI scans, Doppler ultrasound, and arteriography. The diagnosis of stroke itself is clinical, with assistance from the imaging techniques. Imaging techniques also assist in determining the subtypes and cause of stroke. There is yet no commonly used blood test for the stroke diagnosis itself, though blood tests may be of help in finding out the likely cause of stroke. In deceased people, an autopsy of stroke may help establishing the time between stroke onset and death.

===Physical examination===
A physical examination, including taking a medical history of the symptoms and a neurological status, helps giving an evaluation of the location and severity of stroke. It can give a standard score on e.g., the NIH stroke scale.

===Imaging===
For diagnosing ischemic (blockage) stroke in the emergency setting:
* CT scans (&quot;without&quot; contrast enhancements)
** sensitivity= 16% (less than 10% within first 3 hours of symptom onset)
** specificity= 96%
* MRI scan
** sensitivity= 83%
** specificity= 98%
For diagnosing hemorrhagic stroke in the emergency setting:
* CT scans (&quot;without&quot; contrast enhancements)
** sensitivity= 89%
** specificity= 100%
* MRI scan
** sensitivity= 81%
** specificity= 100%
For detecting chronic hemorrhages, an MRI scan is more sensitive.

For the assessment of stable stroke, nuclear medicine scans such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET/CT) may be helpful. SPECT documents cerebral blood flow, whereas PET with an FDG isotope shows cerebral glucose metabolism.

CT scans may not detect ischemic stroke, especially if it is small, of recent onset, or in the brainstem or cerebellum areas (posterior circulation infarct). MRI is better at detecting a posterior circulation infarct with diffusion-weighted imaging. A CT scan is used more to &quot;rule out&quot; certain stroke mimics and detect bleeding. The presence of leptomeningeal collateral circulation in the brain is associated with better clinical outcomes after recanalization treatment. Cerebrovascular reserve capacity is another factor that affects stroke outcome it is the amount of increase in cerebral blood flow after a purposeful stimulation of blood flow by the physician, such as by giving inhaled carbon dioxide or intravenous acetazolamide. The increase in blood flow can be measured by PET scan or transcranial doppler sonography. However, in people with obstruction of the internal carotid artery of one side, the presence of leptomeningeal collateral circulation is associated with reduced cerebral reserve capacity.

===Underlying cause===

When stroke has been diagnosed, other studies may be performed to determine the underlying cause. With the treatment and diagnosis options available, it is of particular importance to determine whether there is a peripheral source of emboli. Test selection may vary since the cause of stroke varies with age, comorbidity and the clinical presentation. The following are commonly used techniques:
* an ultrasound/doppler study of the carotid arteries (to detect carotid stenosis) or dissection of the precerebral arteries;
* an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (to identify arrhythmias and resultant clots in the heart which may spread to the brain vessels through the bloodstream);
* a Holter monitor study to identify intermittent abnormal heart rhythms;
* an angiogram of the cerebral vasculature (if a bleed is thought to have originated from an aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation);
* blood tests to determine if blood cholesterol is high, if there is an abnormal tendency to bleed, and if some rarer processes such as homocystinuria might be involved.

For hemorrhagic stroke, a CT or MRI scan with intravascular contrast may be able to identify abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further stroke as well as complications at the insertion site and this investigation is therefore reserved for specific situations. If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.

===Misdiagnosis===

Among people with ischemic stroke, misdiagnosis occurs 2 to 26% of the time. A &quot;stroke chameleon&quot; (SC) is stroke which is diagnosed as something else.

People not having stroke may also be misdiagnosed with the condition. Giving thrombolytics (clot-busting) in such cases causes intracerebral bleeding 1 to 2% of the time, which is less than that of people with stroke. This unnecessary treatment adds to health care costs. Even so, the AHA/ASA guidelines state that starting intravenous tPA in possible mimics is preferred to delaying treatment for additional testing.

Women, African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders are more often misdiagnosed for a condition other than stroke when in fact having stroke. In addition, adults under 44 years of age are seven times more likely to have stroke missed than are adults over 75 years of age. This is especially the case for younger people with posterior circulation infarcts. Some medical centers have used hyperacute MRI in experimental studies for people initially thought to have a low likelihood of stroke, and in some of these people, stroke has been found which were then treated with thrombolytic medication.

==Prevention==
Given the disease burden of stroke, prevention is an important public health concern. Primary prevention is less effective than secondary prevention (as judged by the number needed to treat to prevent one stroke per year). Recent guidelines detail the evidence for primary prevention in stroke. About the use of aspirin as a preventive medication for stroke, in healthy people aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended, but in people with high cardiovascular risk, or those who have had a myocardial infarction, it provides some protection against a first stroke. In those who have previously had stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against screening for carotid artery stenosis in those without symptoms.

===Risk factors===
The most important modifiable risk factors for stroke are high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, although the size of the effect is small; 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Other modifiable risk factors include high blood cholesterol levels, diabetes mellitus, end-stage kidney disease, cigarette smoking (active and passive), heavy alcohol use, drug use, lack of physical activity, obesity, processed red meat consumption, and unhealthy diet. Smoking just one cigarette per day increases the risk more than 30%. Alcohol use could predispose to ischemic stroke, as well as intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage via multiple mechanisms (for example, via hypertension, atrial fibrillation, rebound thrombocytosis and platelet aggregation and clotting disturbances). Drugs, most commonly amphetamines and cocaine, can induce stroke through damage to the blood vessels in the brain and acute hypertension. Migraine with aura doubles a person&#x27;s risk for ischemic stroke. Untreated, celiac disease regardless of the presence of symptoms can be an underlying cause of stroke, both in children and adults. According to a 2021 WHO study, working 55+ hours a week raises the risk of stroke by 35% and the risk of dying from heart conditions by 17%, when compared to a 35-40-hour week.

High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of stroke by about 26%. There is a lack of high quality studies looking at promotional efforts to improve lifestyle factors. Nonetheless, given the large body of circumstantial evidence, best medical management for stroke includes advice on diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol use. Medication is the most common method of stroke prevention; carotid endarterectomy can be a useful surgical method of preventing stroke.

====Blood pressure====
High blood pressure accounts for 35–50% of stroke risk. Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg systolic or 5 mmHg diastolic reduces the risk of stroke by ~40%. Lowering blood pressure has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. It is equally important in secondary prevention. Even people older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy. The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs—therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered. The routine use of beta-blockers following stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits.

====Blood lipids====
High cholesterol levels have been inconsistently associated with (ischemic) stroke. Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by about 15%. Since earlier meta-analyses of other lipid-lowering drugs did not show a decreased risk, statins might exert their effect through mechanisms other than their lipid-lowering effects.

====Diabetes mellitus====
Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of stroke by 2 to 3 times. While intensive blood sugar control has been shown to reduce small blood vessel complications such as kidney damage and damage to the retina of the eye it has not been shown to reduce large blood vessel complications such as stroke.

====Anticoagulant drugs====
Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin have been the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several studies have shown that aspirin and other antiplatelets are highly effective in secondary prevention after stroke or transient ischemic attack. Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150 mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown. Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding but are more expensive. Both aspirin and clopidogrel may be useful in the first few weeks after a minor stroke or high-risk TIA. Clopidogrel has less side effects than ticlopidine. Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect. Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.

Those with atrial fibrillation have a 5% a year risk of stroke, and those with valvular atrial fibrillation have an even higher risk. Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin or aspirin is useful for prevention with various levels of comparative effectiveness depending on the type of treatment used.

Oral anticoagulants, especially Xa (apixaban) and thrombin (dabigatran) inhibitors, have been shown to be superior to warfarin in stroke reduction and have a lower or similar bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. Except in people with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulants are not advised for stroke prevention—any benefit is offset by bleeding risk.

In primary prevention, however, antiplatelet drugs did not reduce the risk of ischemic stroke but increased the risk of major bleeding. Further studies are needed to investigate a possible protective effect of aspirin against ischemic stroke in women.

====Surgery====
Carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid artery. There is evidence supporting this procedure in selected cases. Endarterectomy for a significant stenosis has been shown to be useful in preventing further stroke in those who have already had the condition. Carotid artery stenting has not been shown to be equally useful. People are selected for surgery based on age, gender, degree of stenosis, time since symptoms and the person&#x27;s preferences. Surgery is most efficient when not delayed too long—the risk of recurrent stroke in a person who has a 50% or greater stenosis is up to 20% after 5 years, but endarterectomy reduces this risk to around 5%. The number of procedures needed to cure one person was 5 for early surgery (within two weeks after the initial stroke), but 125 if delayed longer than 12 weeks.

Screening for carotid artery narrowing has not been shown to be a useful test in the general population. Studies of surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis without symptoms have shown only a small decrease in the risk of stroke. To be beneficial, the complication rate of the surgery should be kept below 4%. Even then, for 100 surgeries, 5 people will benefit by avoiding stroke, 3 will develop stroke despite surgery, 3 will develop stroke or die due to the surgery itself, and 89 will remain stroke-free but would also have done so without intervention.

====Diet====
Nutrition, specifically the Mediterranean-style diet, has the potential to decrease the risk of having a stroke by more than half. It does not appear that lowering levels of homocysteine with folic acid affects the risk of stroke.

===Women===
A number of specific recommendations have been made for women including taking aspirin after the 11th week of pregnancy if there is a history of previous chronic high blood pressure and taking blood pressure medications during pregnancy if the blood pressure is greater than 150 mmHg systolic or greater than 100 mmHg diastolic. In those who have previously had preeclampsia, other risk factors should be treated more aggressively.

===Previous stroke or TIA===
Keeping blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is recommended. Anticoagulation can prevent recurrent ischemic stroke. Among people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%. However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke. Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined according to the CHA2DS2–VASc score. The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.

Anticoagulants, when used following stroke, should not be stopped for dental procedures.

If studies show carotid artery stenosis, and the person has a degree of residual function on the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke.

==Management==
Stroke, whether ischemic or hemorrhagic, is an emergency that warrants immediate medical attention. The specific treatment will depend on the type of stroke, the time elapsed since the onset of symptoms, and the underlying cause or presence of comorbidities.

===Ischemic stroke===
Aspirin reduces the overall risk of recurrence by 13% with greater benefit early on. Definitive therapy within the first few hours is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down (thrombolysis), or by removing it mechanically (thrombectomy). The philosophical premise underlying the importance of rapid stroke intervention was summed up as &quot;Time is Brain!&quot; in the early 1990s. Years later, that same idea, that rapid cerebral blood flow restoration results in fewer brain cells dying, has been proved and quantified.

Tight blood sugar control in the first few hours does not improve outcomes and may cause harm. High blood pressure is also not typically lowered as this has not been found to be helpful. Cerebrolysin, a mixture of pig brain-derived neurotrophic factors used widely to treat acute ischemic stroke in China, Eastern Europe, Russia, post-Soviet countries, and other Asian countries, does not improve outcomes or prevent death and may increase the risk of severe adverse events. There is also no evidence that cerebrolysin‐like peptide mixtures which are extracted from cattle brain is helpful in treating acute ischemic stroke.

====Thrombolysis====
Thrombolysis, such as with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset, results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability. It does not, however, improve chances of survival. Benefit is greater the earlier it is used. Between three and four and a half hours the effects are less clear. The AHA/ASA recommend it for certain people in this time frame. A 2014 review found a 5% increase in the number of people living without disability at three to six months; however, there was a 2% increased risk of death in the short term. After four and a half hours thrombolysis worsens outcomes. These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated. There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not. In those with findings of savable tissue on medical imaging between 4.5 hours and 9 hours or who wake up with stroke, alteplase results in some benefit.

Its use is endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms as long as there are no other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality. 6.4% of people with large stroke developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality. The American Academy of Emergency Medicine had previously stated that objective evidence regarding the applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke was insufficient. In 2013 the American College of Emergency Medicine refuted this position, acknowledging the body of evidence for the use of tPA in ischemic stroke; but debate continues. Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.

====Endovascular treatment====
Mechanical removal of the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke, called mechanical thrombectomy, is a potential treatment for occlusion of a large artery, such as the middle cerebral artery. In 2015, one review demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this procedure if performed within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms. It did not change the risk of death but did reduce disability compared to the use of intravenous thrombolysis, which is generally used in people evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy. Certain cases may benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.

==== Craniectomy ====
Stroke affecting large portions of the brain can cause significant brain swelling with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue. This phenomenon is mainly encountered in stroke affecting brain tissue dependent upon the middle cerebral artery for blood supply and is also called &quot;malignant cerebral infarction&quot; because it carries a dismal prognosis. Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require hemicraniectomy, the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head. This decreases the risk of death, although some people – who would otherwise have died – survive with disability.

===Hemorrhagic stroke===
People with intracerebral hemorrhage require supportive care, including blood pressure control if required. People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels. Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible). A proportion may benefit from neurosurgical intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location and the size of the hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as to which people with intracerebral hemorrhage may benefit.

In subarachnoid hemorrhage, early treatment for underlying cerebral aneurysms may reduce the risk of further hemorrhages. Depending on the site of the aneurysm this may be by surgery that involves opening the skull or endovascularly (through the blood vessels).

===Stroke unit===
Ideally, people who have had stroke are admitted to a &quot;stroke unit&quot;, a ward or dedicated area in a hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment. It has been shown that people admitted to stroke units have a higher chance of surviving than those admitted elsewhere in hospital, even if they are being cared for by doctors without experience in stroke. Nursing care is fundamental in maintaining skin care, feeding, hydration, positioning, and monitoring vital signs such as temperature, pulse, and blood pressure.

== Rehabilitation ==
Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling stroke undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications, and educate family members to play a supporting role. Stroke rehabilitation should begin almost immediately with a multidisciplinary approach. The rehabilitation team may involve physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, neurologists, clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and orthotists. Some teams may also include psychologists and social workers, since at least one-third of affected people manifests post stroke depression. Validated instruments such as the Barthel scale may be used to assess the likelihood of a person who has had stroke being able to manage at home with or without support subsequent to discharge from a hospital.

Stroke rehabilitation should be started as quickly as possible and can last anywhere from a few days to over a year. Most return of function is seen in the first few months, and then improvement falls off with the &quot;window&quot; considered officially by U.S. state rehabilitation units and others to be closed after six months, with little chance of further improvement. However, some people have reported that they continue to improve for years, regaining and strengthening abilities like writing, walking, running, and talking. Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the daily routine for people who have had stroke. Complete recovery is unusual but not impossible and most people will improve to some extent: proper diet and exercise are known to help the brain to recover.

=== Spatial neglect ===

The body of evidence is uncertain on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation for reducing the disabling effects of neglect and increasing independence remains unproven. However, there is limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate beneficial effect on tests of neglect. Overall, no rehabilitation approach can be supported by evidence for spatial neglect.

=== Automobile driving ===

The body of evidence is uncertain whether the use of rehabilitation can improve on-road driving skills following stroke. There is limited evidence that training on a driving simulator will improve performance on recognizing road signs after training. The findings are based on low-quality evidence as further research is needed involving large numbers of participants.

=== Yoga ===

Based on low quality evidence, it is uncertain whether yoga has a significant benefit for stroke rehabilitation on measures of quality of life, balance, strength, endurance, pain, and disability scores. Yoga may reduce anxiety and could be included as part of patient-centred stroke rehabilitation. Further research is needed assessing the benefits and safety of yoga in stroke rehabilitation.

=== Action observation physical therapy for upper limbs ===

Low-quality evidence suggests that action observation (a type of physiotherapy that is meant to improve neural plasticity through the mirror-neuronal system) may be of some benefit and has no significant adverse effects, however this benefit may not be clinically significant and further research is suggested.

=== Cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits ===

The body of scientific evidence is uncertain on the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits in patients following stroke. While there may be an immediate effect after treatment on attention, the findings are based on low to moderate quality and small number of studies. Further research is needed to assess whether the effect can be sustained in day-to-day tasks requiring attention.

=== Motor imagery for gait rehabilitation ===

The latest evidence supports the short-term benefits of motor imagery (MI) on walking speed in individuals who have had stroke, in comparison to other therapies. MI does not improve motor function after stroke and does not seem to cause significant adverse events. The findings are based on low-quality evidence as further research is needed to estimate the effect of MI on walking endurance and the dependence on personal assistance.

=== Physical and occupational therapy ===
Physical and occupational therapy have overlapping areas of expertise; however, physical therapy focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with people who have had stroke to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and people&#x27;s goals. One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the person relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes. Physical therapy is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke. Occupational therapy is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Approaches to helping people with urinary incontinence include physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and specialized interventions with experienced medical professionals, however, it is not clear how effective these approaches are at improving urinary incontinence following stroke.

Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through different positions. Gaining initial improvement in range of motion is often achieved through rhythmic rotational patterns associated with the affected limb. After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint. Cold ice wraps or ice packs may briefly relieve spasticity by temporarily reducing neural firing rates. Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success. Physical therapy is sometimes suggested for people who experience sexual dysfunction following stroke.

==== Interventions for age-related visual problems in patients with stroke ====
With the prevalence of vision problems increasing with age in stroke patients, the overall effect of interventions for age-related visual problems is uncertain. It is also not sure whether people with stroke respond differently from the general population when treating eye problems. Further research in this area is needed as the body of evidence is very low quality.

=== Speech and language therapy ===
Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing.

Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke improves functional communication, reading, writing and expressive language. Speech and language therapy that is higher intensity, higher dose or provided over a long duration of time leads to significantly better functional communication but people might be more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week). A total of 20–50 hours of speech and language therapy is necessary for the best recovery. The most improvement happens when 2–5 hours of therapy is provided each week over 4–5 days. Recovery is further improved when besides the therapy people practice tasks at home. Speech and language therapy is also effective if it is delivered online through video or by a family member who has been trained by a professional therapist.

Recovery with therapy for aphasia is also dependent on the recency of stroke and the age of the person. Receiving therapy within a month after the stroke leads to the greatest improvements. 3 or 6 months after the stroke more therapy will be needed but symptoms can still be improved. People with aphasia who are younger than 55 years are the most likely to improve but people older than 75 years can still get better with therapy.

People who have had stroke may have particular problems, such as dysphagia, which can cause swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely. Swallowing therapy has mixed results as of 2018.

=== Devices ===
Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved by the use of ankle foot orthoses.

=== Physical fitness ===
Stroke can also reduce people&#x27;s general fitness. Reduced fitness can reduce capacity for rehabilitation as well as general health. Physical exercises as part of a rehabilitation program following stroke appear safe. Cardiorespiratory fitness training that involves walking in rehabilitation can improve speed, tolerance and independence during walking, and may improve balance. There are inadequate long-term data about the effects of exercise and training on death, dependence and disability after stroke. The future areas of research may concentrate on the optimal exercise prescription and long-term health benefits of exercise. The effect of physical training on cognition also may be studied further.

The ability to walk independently in their community, indoors or outdoors, is important following stroke. Although no negative effects have been reported, it is unclear if outcomes can improve with these walking programs when compared to usual treatment.

=== Other therapy methods ===
Some current and future therapy methods include the use of virtual reality and video games for rehabilitation. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating people to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not. While virtual reality and interactive video gaming are not more effective than conventional therapy for improving upper limb function, when used in conjunction with usual care these approaches may improve upper limb function and ADL function. There are inadequate data on the effect of virtual reality and interactive video gaming on gait speed, balance, participation and quality of life. Many clinics and hospitals are adopting the use of these off-the-shelf devices for exercise, social interaction, and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home.

Mirror therapy is associated with improved motor function of the upper extremity in people who have had stroke.

Other non-invasive rehabilitation methods used to augment physical therapy of motor function in people recovering from stroke include neurotherapy as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct-current stimulation. and robotic therapies. Constraint‐induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice may be effective in improving upper limb function. However, further primary research, specifically of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy and virtual reality is needed.

=== Orthotics ===

Clinical studies confirm the importance of orthoses in stroke rehabilitation. The orthosis supports the therapeutic applications and also helps to mobilize the patient at an early stage. With the help of an orthosis, physiological standing and walking can be learned again, and late health consequences caused by a wrong gait pattern can be prevented. A treatment with an orthosis can therefore be used to support the therapy.

=== Self-management ===
Stroke can affect the ability to live independently and with quality. Self-management programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with their challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and led by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs improve the quality of life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training.

==Prognosis==
Disability affects 75% of stroke survivors enough to decrease their ability to work.
Stroke can affect people physically, mentally, emotionally, or a combination of the three. The results of stroke vary widely depending on size and location of the lesion.

=== Physical effects ===
Some of the physical disabilities that can result from stroke include muscle weakness, numbness, pressure sores, pneumonia, incontinence, apraxia (inability to perform learned movements), difficulties carrying out daily activities, appetite loss, speech loss, vision loss and pain. If the stroke is severe enough, or in a certain location such as parts of the brainstem, coma or death can result. Up to 10% of people following stroke develop seizures, most commonly in the week subsequent to the event; the severity of the stroke increases the likelihood of a seizure. An estimated 15% of people experience urinary incontinence for more than a year following stroke. 50% of people have a decline in sexual function (sexual dysfunction) following stroke.

=== Emotional and mental effects ===
Emotional and mental dysfunctions correspond to areas in the brain that have been damaged. Emotional problems following stroke can be due to direct damage to emotional centers in the brain or from frustration and difficulty adapting to new limitations. Post-stroke emotional difficulties include anxiety, panic attacks, flat affect (failure to express emotions), mania, apathy and psychosis. Other difficulties may include a decreased ability to communicate emotions through facial expression, body language and voice.

Disruption in self-identity, relationships with others, and emotional well-being can lead to social consequences after stroke due to the lack of ability to communicate. Many people who experience communication impairments after stroke find it more difficult to cope with the social issues rather than physical impairments. Broader aspects of care must address the emotional impact speech impairment has on those who experience difficulties with speech after stroke. Those who experience a stroke are at risk of paralysis, which could result in a self-disturbed body image, which may also lead to other social issues.

30 to 50% of stroke survivors develop post-stroke depression, which is characterized by lethargy, irritability, sleep disturbances, lowered self-esteem and withdrawal. It is most common in those with a stroke affecting the anterior parts of the brain or the basal ganglia, particularly on the left side. Depression can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with social and family support, psychotherapy and, in severe cases, antidepressants. Psychotherapy sessions may have a small effect on improving mood and preventing depression after stroke. Antidepressant medications may be useful for treating depression after stroke but are associated with central nervous system and gastrointestinal adverse events.

Emotional lability, another consequence of stroke, causes the person to switch quickly between emotional highs and lows and to express emotions inappropriately, for instance with an excess of laughing or crying with little or no provocation. While these expressions of emotion usually correspond to the person&#x27;s actual emotions, a more severe form of emotional lability causes the affected person to laugh and cry pathologically, without regard to context or emotion. Some people show the opposite of what they feel, for example crying when they are happy. Emotional lability occurs in about 20% of those who have had stroke. Those with a right hemisphere stroke are more likely to have empathy problems which can make communication harder.

Cognitive deficits resulting from stroke include perceptual disorders, aphasia, dementia, and problems with attention and memory. Stroke survivors may be unaware of their own disabilities, a condition called anosognosia. In a condition called hemispatial neglect, the affected person is unable to attend to anything on the side of space opposite to the damaged hemisphere. Cognitive and psychological outcome after stroke can be affected by the age at which the stroke happened, pre-stroke baseline intellectual functioning, psychiatric history and whether there is pre-existing brain pathology.

==Epidemiology==

Stroke was the second most frequent cause of death worldwide in 2011, accounting for 6.2 million deaths (~11% of the total). Approximately 17 million people had stroke in 2010 and 33 million people have previously had stroke and were still alive. Between 1990 and 2010 the incidence of stroke decreased by approximately 10% in the developed world and increased by 10% in the developing world. Overall, two-thirds of stroke occurred in those over 65 years old. South Asians are at particularly high risk of stroke, accounting for 40% of global stroke deaths. Incidence of ischemic stroke is ten times more frequent than haemorrhagic stroke.

It is ranked after heart disease and before cancer. In the United States stroke is a leading cause of disability, and recently declined from the third leading to the fourth leading cause of death. Geographic disparities in stroke incidence have been observed, including the existence of a &quot;stroke belt&quot; in the southeastern United States, but causes of these disparities have not been explained.

The risk of stroke increases exponentially from 30 years of age, and the cause varies by age. Advanced age is one of the most significant stroke risk factors. 95% of stroke occurs in people age 45 and older, and two-thirds of stroke occurs in those over the age of 65.

A person&#x27;s risk of dying if he or she does have stroke also increases with age. However, stroke can occur at any age, including in childhood.

Family members may have a genetic tendency for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke. Higher levels of Von Willebrand factor are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke for the first time. The results of this study found that the only significant genetic factor was the person&#x27;s blood type. Having stroke in the past greatly increases one&#x27;s risk of future stroke.

Men are 25% more likely to develop stroke than women, yet 60% of deaths from stroke occur in women. Since women live longer, they are older on average when they have stroke and thus more often killed. Some risk factors for stroke apply only to women. Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and the treatment thereof (HRT).

==History==
Episodes of stroke and familial stroke have been reported from the 2nd millennium BC onward in ancient Mesopotamia and Persia. Hippocrates (460 to 370 BC) was first to describe the phenomenon of sudden paralysis that is often associated with ischemia. Apoplexy, from the Greek word meaning &quot;struck down with violence&quot;, first appeared in Hippocratic writings to describe this phenomenon.
The word &quot;stroke&quot; was used as a synonym for apoplectic seizure as early as 1599, and is a fairly literal translation of the Greek term. The term &quot;apoplectic stroke&quot; is an archaic, nonspecific term, for a cerebrovascular accident accompanied by haemorrhage or haemorrhagic stroke. Martin Luther was described as having an &quot;apoplectic stroke&quot; that deprived him of his speech shortly before his death in 1546.

In 1658, in his &quot;Apoplexia&quot;, Johann Jacob Wepfer (1620–1695) identified the cause of hemorrhagic stroke when he suggested that people who had died of apoplexy had bleeding in their brains.
Wepfer also identified the main arteries supplying the brain, the vertebral and carotid arteries, and identified the cause of a type of ischemic stroke known as a cerebral infarction when he suggested that apoplexy might be caused by a blockage to those vessels. Rudolf Virchow first described the mechanism of thromboembolism as a major factor.

The term &quot;cerebrovascular accident&quot; was introduced in 1927, reflecting a &quot;growing awareness and acceptance of vascular theories and (...) recognition of the consequences of a sudden disruption in the vascular supply of the brain&quot;. Its use is now discouraged by a number of neurology textbooks, reasoning that the connotation of fortuitousness carried by the word &quot;accident&quot; insufficiently highlights the modifiability of the underlying risk factors. &quot;Cerebrovascular insult&quot; may be used interchangeably.

The term &quot;brain attack&quot; was introduced for use to underline the acute nature of stroke according to the American Stroke Association, which has used the term since 1990, and is used colloquially to refer to both ischemic as well as hemorrhagic stroke.

==Research==
As of 2017, angioplasty and stents were under preliminary clinical research to determine the possible therapeutic advantages of these procedures in comparison to therapy with statins, antithrombotics, or antihypertensive drugs.

Animal models indicate that administration of low-dose amphetamine facilitates behavioural recovery following ischemic stroke, when administered several days after the ischemic event. This is accompanied by reductions in volumes of tissue lost, increases in fractional anisotropy ratio on the affected side, and increases in BDNF expression, matrix metalloproteinase activity, and expression of synaptophysin.

<text>Matthew William Sorum (born November 19, 1960) is an American drummer. He is best known as both a former member of the hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, with whom he recorded three studio albums, and as a member of the supergroup Velvet Revolver. Sorum is currently on tour with Billy Gibbons, with whom he also records, is a member of the touring project Kings of Chaos, and is a former member of both The Cult and Y Kant Tori Read. Sorum was also a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses side projects, Slash&#x27;s Snakepit and Neurotic Outsiders, and has released two solo albums, &quot;Hollywood Zen&quot; (2004) and &quot;Stratosphere&quot; (2014). He was the touring drummer for the supergroup Hollywood Vampires from 2015 to 2017. His latest project is Deadland Ritual, featuring Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler, Billy Idol guitarist Steve Stevens, and Apocalyptica vocalist Franky Perez.
After performing on Tori Amos&#x27; first record and synthpop band Y Kant Tori Read&#x27;s sole album, Sorum joined the Cult in 1989 to tour in support of their fourth studio album, &quot;Sonic Temple&quot; (1989). During the tour, Sorum was spotted by Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash and subsequently replaced their drummer Steven Adler in 1990. Remaining in the band for seven years, Sorum recorded the albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; (1991), &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; (1991), and &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot; (1993), before departing in 1997 following an argument with Axl Rose.

In 1999, Sorum rejoined The Cult to perform on their reunion album, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; (2001), and its subsequent 2000/2001 tours, and subsequently co-founded the hard rock supergroup Velvet Revolver, alongside former Guns N&#x27; Roses bandmates Slash and Duff McKagan. The band, which included guitarist Dave Kushner and Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland, released two successful studio albums, &quot;Contraband&quot; (2004) and &quot;Libertad&quot; (2007), before entering an extended hiatus following Weiland&#x27;s departure.

Sorum has been a permanent member of hard rock cover band Camp Freddy since 2003, alongside Jane&#x27;s Addiction members Dave Navarro and Chris Chaney, and assisted in hosting its radio show and podcast on Indie 103.1. In 2012, Sorum founded a touring project, entitled Kings of Chaos, featuring members of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Deep Purple, Def Leppard, Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Cheap Trick and Slipknot.

In 2012, Sorum was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Guns N&#x27; Roses.

==Career==

=== 1960–1989: Early career ===
Sorum was born Matthew William Sorum on November 19, 1960, in an unincorporated area of Orange County, California, that later became the city of Mission Viejo. He started to play drums after watching Ringo Starr with The Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1964. Later he was mainly influenced by Ian Paice, Keith Moon, Neil Peart, Ginger Baker, John Bonham, Roger Taylor, Buddy Rich and Bill Ward.

At Mission Viejo High School Sorum was part of the jazz band, marching band, and wind ensemble. According to Sorum, he and his high school band, Prophecy, would play at The Starwood on amateur nights.

Sorum&#x27;s work with Chateau produced a four-song set that was covered by local radio stations for a short time, but the music scene changed from grandiose rock to punk and alternative new wave music. Sorum left and went to Hollywood to play with a series of bands, including Population Five, with bassist Prescott Niles from The Knack, and Hawk, replacing Scott Travis, who went to play with Racer X and later Judas Priest. He then left on a tour around the country with a blues guitarist, playing nightclubs and bars.

In 1988, he was recruited to play on the debut album of Y Kant Tori Read, a band fronted by a then unknown Tori Amos. In the wake of that project, he joined The Cult as their live drummer for the 1989/1990 tour in support of &quot;Sonic Temple&quot;.

=== 1990–1997: Guns N&#x27; Roses, Slash&#x27;s Snakepit and Neurotic Outsiders. ===
In 1989, Slash saw Sorum live with The Cult on the Sonic Temple tour and, shortly after, Sorum joined Guns N&#x27; Roses as Steven Adler&#x27;s replacement.

Sorum with Guns N&#x27; Roses can be heard on the 1990 cover of the Bob Dylan track &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;, the albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot;, &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; (excluding the track &quot;Civil War&quot;), &quot;&quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot;&quot;, the 1994 cover of The Rolling Stones track &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; and the majority of &quot;Live Era: &#x27;87-&#x27;93&quot;. Sorum featured fully on the lengthy Use Your Illusion Tour, drumming on all of the 194 shows, 9 legs and to over 7 million fans.

In 1994, Sorum formed Slash&#x27;s Snakepit with Slash and Gilby Clarke and drummed on their debut album, &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot;. Sorum also lent his drumming skills to the theme song for the 1995 20th Century Fox film &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;. That same year, Sorum formed the supergroup Neurotic Outsiders, which featured bandmate Duff McKagan. In 1996 they released their only album, the self-titled &quot;Neurotic Outsiders&quot;. John Taylor (Duran Duran) and Steve Jones (Sex Pistols) also participated on this album, and toured behind it. Early performances featured guest spots by Simon Le Bon (Duran Duran), Slash, and Billy Idol.

In 1997, Sorum was fired from Guns N&#x27; Roses by Axl Rose after an argument with Rose over the inclusion of Paul Tobias in the band. Sorum claimed that Tobias made disparaging remarks about a Slash performance on TV, resulting in him blowing up at Tobias. Slash had recently left the band, and Sorum told Axl “without Slash there is no Guns N’ Roses”, to which Rose asked if he was going to quit the band. Sorum said no, then Rose fired him.

In April 2006, nine years after leaving Guns N&#x27; Roses, Sorum re-established his friendship with the band&#x27;s lead singer Axl Rose.

=== 1998–2008: Return to The Cult and Velvet Revolver era ===
In 1998, he released his first and only drum instructional video (Drum Licks and Tricks from the Rock n Roll Jungle) demonstrating his techniques. In 1999, Matt joined The Cult once again and featured on their album &quot;Beyond Good And Evil&quot;, which he spent most of 2001 touring in support of.

In 1999, Sorum reunited with Slash and McKagan to promote a concert for the independent film &quot;Soundman&quot; (written and directed by Steven Ho) at the Slamdance Film Festival. Sorum had composed the film with Lanny Cordola and Michael Stearns. Realizing that they still had chemistry together, they formed a new band called Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and rhythm guitarist Dave Kushner. After the 2004 release of their debut album, &quot;Contraband&quot;, they embarked on a worldwide tour that continued through December 2005. In August 2005, Sorum broke his wrist in a boating accident, stalling the tour temporarily. While recovering from the wrist injury the drummer Brian Tichy and Mark Schulman filled in for him. In 2005, the band was nominated for three Grammys, Rock Album of the Year, Rock Song, and Hard Rock Performance for their &quot;Contraband&quot; single &quot;Slither&quot;, which won their first and only Grammy.

After taking some time off in 2006, Sorum and the rest of the band returned to the studio in December to record &quot;Libertad&quot;, Velvet Revolver&#x27;s second album, which was released on July 3, 2007. Sorum toured with Velvet Revolver until singer Weiland parted ways with the band on April 1, 2008.

===Other ventures===
In 1994, Sorum was one of many guest drummers on the album &quot;Burning for Buddy: A Tribute to the Music of Buddy Rich&quot;. Playing with the Buddy Rich Big Band, Sorum was able to display his skill and finesse as a jazz drummer.

Sorum released his first solo album, &quot;Hollywood Zen&quot;, in 2003. Available through his website, it was a musical statement about his life, touring, relationships, etc. In the same year, Sorum began playing with the newly formed Camp Freddy.

Sorum has endorsed Zildjian cymbals, featured in numerous sweepstakes with Zildjian, and lent his talents to Submersible Music&#x27;s DrumCore software.

In 2006, Sorum began guest recording in his studio with a new project, called Circus Diablo. That year, he launched a clothing line, SorumNoce.

On June 4, 2008, Sorum revealed Camp Freddy is working on an album.

Sorum was featured in episode 54 of TV&#x27;s &quot;LA Ink&quot; originally airing on August 27, 2009. In it, Kat Von D. tattoos a portrait of his wife Ace on his leg.

Matt filled in on Motörhead&#x27;s 2009 US tour, while drummer Mikkey Dee took part in &quot;Kändisdjungeln&quot;, a Swedish version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. &quot;I can retire now,&quot; Sorum joked. &quot;When they let me off in Kansas, I might open my own corn farm and just wear my Motörhead jacket. &#x27;This is it, I&#x27;m done!&#x27; Axl calls and it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Aw, fuck that – I played with &quot;Motörhead!&quot;

After performing together at the Giving 2010 benefit event on May 3, 2010, Sorum formed the cover band Carnival of Dogs with Tracii Guns (L.A. Guns, formerly of Brides of Destruction), Franky Perez (Solo, Scars on Broadway, DKFXP) and Phil Soussan (previously played with Ozzy Osbourne, Billy Idol and Vince Neil).

He made an appearance in an episode of &quot;FSN Sport Science&quot;, when a test was undertaken to determine if a professional basketball point guard had faster hands than a drummer.

In 2010 and 2011 Sorum appeared on the reality show &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll Fantasy Camp&quot;. He appeared as one of the counselors guiding a new band in a music competition.

In 2012, Matt Sorum and Ace Harper formed the band Diamond Baby and are both featured in the music video &quot;The Last Rockstar&quot; with actresses Jane Lynch, Juliette Lewis, and the late Verne Troyer.&quot; In 2012, Sorum and Jane Lynch created Adopt the Arts to save the arts from being eliminated from Los Angeles elementary schools.

In 2014, he worked with Animals Asia and adopted a moon bear that had been on a Chinese bear-bile farm, when her bile was extracted for traditional medicine. He hoped to draw attention to the abuse that bears suffer on the farms in China and Vietnam. He has since become an ambassador for the cause.

Sorum is also an auxiliary member of the Cooper-fronted rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires, appearing on the band&#x27;s eponymous 2015 debut studio album and playing drums at the band&#x27;s high-profile Rock in Rio show on September 24, 2015, as well as preceding warm-up shows at The Roxy on September 16 and 17. Sorum played with the Hollywood Vampires during their February 2016 Grammy Award Performance.

In 2018, Matt unveiled Artbit, a distributed-ledger platform that enables both artists and fans to share and monetise artistic talent from anywhere across the globe.

<text>The National Comedy Awards (known as the British Comedy Awards from 1990 to 2014) is an annual awards ceremony in the United Kingdom, celebrating notable comedians and entertainment performances of the previous year.

==The British Comedy Awards (1990–2014)==

The awards were shown live on ITV in December from 1990 to 2006, after which the broadcast of the British Comedy Awards 2007 was suspended by ITV due to allegations of irregularities and deception in the awarding of the 2005 People&#x27;s Choice Award and then ongoing related investigations about the 2007 British premium-rate phone-in scandal resulting in Ofcom&#x27;s subsequently fining ITV a record £5.675 million for its misuse of premium-rate telephone lines.

After Michael Parkinson presented the inaugural ceremony at the London Palladium in December 1990, the majority of subsequent shows were presented by Jonathan Ross, staged at London Studios, and produced by Michael Hurll Television (MHTV), whose parent company is Unique Communications Group. Ross did not present the 2008 awards, in light of The Russell Brand Show prank calls and was replaced for that year by Angus Deayton.

The 2007 show occurred on 6 December 2007, but was not televised due to the 2005 controversy and subsequent investigations. The following years ceremony was shown live on 6 December 2008. Compliance for the show was the responsibility of the ITV Compliance Unit of ITV Network Limited (consisting of members from ITV plc, STV Group, UTV Media, and Channel Television Ltd).

In June 2010, it was announced that awards were to be broadcast on Channel 4 for three years, which was later extended for one more year. Shortly afterwards, the 2010 ceremony was postponed until it finally aired in January 2011. In June 2015 Channel 4 announced they would be dropping the ceremony.

==National Comedy Awards (2022–)==
In August 2020, Channel 4 announced the launch of the National Comedy Awards, a new annual awards ceremony event with multiple categories all decided by a public vote. Produced in collaboration with Hungry Bear Media, the awards ceremony is linked to Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; charity drive, with comedy fans being encouraged to donate in order to help accelerate life-saving research. Phil Harris, Channel 4&#x27;s head of entertainment, said: &quot;This is an award show for our times. Fans will be able to vote on the people, some established and others less so, who really make them laugh. We will be celebrating some incredible comedy talent while supporting the incredible Stand Up to Cancer. It promises to be a very special night of TV.&quot;

Aiming to celebrate &quot;the UK&#x27;s most brilliant comedy content and creators&quot;, the first ceremony was due to be held in the spring of 2021 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the new date of on 15 December 2021 being set by Hungry Bear Media and Channel 4. The first ceremony was due to be held at the Roundhouse in London, with Channel 4 due to broadcast the event two days later as part of their Friday night comedy line-up. Due to the ongoing pandemic and concerns over the Omicron variant, the show was cancelled by the organisers a week before it was due to be staged and Channel 4 said that it would be rescheduled for another time.

The ceremony was finally held on 2 March 2022 and broadcast on Channel 4 three days later. The ceremony was hosted by comedian Tom Allen, with presenters including Matt Lucas, Jessica Hynes, Al Murray and Meera Syal. It included a tribute to Sean Lock.

==Controversies==

===Investigation of alleged irregularities and deception===
At the 2005 ceremony, the wrong show received the People&#x27;s Choice Award. The award was &quot;mistakenly given&quot; to &quot;Ant &amp; Dec&#x27;s Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; even though &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot; received the most tabulated votes and should have been declared the winner, and Ant &amp; Dec were asked to return their 2005 award.

Charged by the awards show with investigating the allegations of irregularities, the independent law firm Olswang summarized its findings as follows: &quot;Robbie Williams was invited to present an award. It was understood that he would be happy [to do so] if the recipients were Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. In order to ensure his attendance, this assurance was given. But it could not be &quot;definitively&quot; established that Williams&#x27; involvement led to the wrong winner being announced&quot; [italics added].

&quot;Saturday Night Takeaway&quot; did, however, receive the People&#x27;s Choice Award at the British Comedy Awards 2006.

===Phone-in scandal===
Beginning on 26 July 2007, British tabloid newspapers reported the alleged involvement of the British Comedy Awards in the 2007 British television phone-in scandal. ITV announced that they postponed the British Comedy Awards 2007 due to the voting irregularities. In a statement, the company said: &quot;Pending conclusion of the investigation, broadcast of the British Comedy Awards 2007 will be postponed. ... ITV will not make any further comment regarding this matter until the conclusion of the investigation.&quot;

It was announced on 21 September 2007 that the British Comedy Awards 2007 would not be screened by ITV1; however, it was not confirmed then that the Awards would still take place in December, and it was not ruled out that they could be screened by another channel. The 2007 awards did take place on 5 December 2007, but that show was not televised. In early May 2008 Ofcom announced its fining and sanctioning ITV plc in a press release.

On 15 August 2008, it was announced that a similar scandal could have been committed in the award ceremony at the 2004 Awards.

Following the &quot;Russell Brand Show&quot; prank calls row and his 12-week unpaid suspension from all of his BBC shows, Jonathan Ross resigned from presenting the 2008 awards, in agreement with ITV, as he did not want to &quot;take away from the awards themselves or the many talented winners of the awards.&quot; Angus Deayton replaced Jonathan Ross as the host of the British Comedy Awards. Ross returned to presenting the awards in 2009.

<text>Cornelis Johannes &quot;Kees&quot; van Houten (18 February 1920 – 24 August 2002) was a Dutch astronomer.

==Early life and education==
Born in The Hague, he spent his entire career at Leiden University except for a brief period (1954–1956) as a research assistant at Yerkes Observatory.

==Family==
He married fellow astronomer Ingrid Groeneveld (who became Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld) and together they became interested in asteroids. They had one son, Karel.

==Work as astronomer==
In a jointly credited trio with Tom Gehrels and Ingrid, he was an extremely prolific discoverer of many thousands of asteroids. Gehrels did a sky survey using the 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory and shipped the plates to the van Houtens at Leiden Observatory, who analyzed them for new asteroids. The trio are jointly credited with several thousand discoveries. When the orbit of an asteroid is determined, it can be classified as an Apollo asteroid (e.g. 1862 Apollo), an Amor asteroid (e.g. 1221 Amor) or a Trojan asteroid (e.g. 55701 Ukalegon).

:Statistics of asteroids were scarcely known until the 1950s when C. J. and I. van Houten made them their lives&#x27; dedication in the Yerkes-McDonald Survey and the Palomar-Leiden surveys . The van Houtens did not just do most of the work, but they also took care of bias problems in an exemplary manner.&quot;

He also studied the radial velocities of close binary stars. He never retired, but remained active and published articles until his death, on asteroids and eclipsing binaries. The main-belt asteroid
1673 van Houten was named in his honor.

<text>Skylands Stadium (known from its opening until 2014 as Skylands Park) is a baseball stadium located in the Augusta section of Frankford Township in Sussex County, New Jersey. It is located off of US 206, near its intersection with Route 15, on a plot of land adjacent to the Sussex County Fairgrounds where the Sussex County Farm and Horse Show and the New Jersey State Fair are held concurrently every August, and is home to the Sussex County Miners of the independent Frontier League.

Skylands Stadium opened in 1994 and was built for the New Jersey Cardinals, the New York–Penn League affiliate for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals called the park home until 2005, after which the team was sold and moved. The Cardinals were replaced by the Sussex Skyhawks, an independent minor league team that began play in 2006 and folded after the 2010 season. Skylands Stadium also served as the home field for several other sports organizations.

In October 2013, Skylands Stadium was purchased by Al Dorso, a businessman who owns State Fair Superstore in Belleville, New Jersey, operates the annual State Fair Meadowlands in the parking lots surrounding MetLife Stadium, and is the owner of the Sussex County Miners.

In October 2021, the field at Skylands Stadium was renamed Columbus Field and a monument to Christopher Columbus, that was previously located in Newark, New Jersey, was placed in the front of the stadium. The statue and field naming were unveiled as part of a Columbus Day celebration with food, music, giveaways, and appearances by local politicians, Italian American organizations, and the Knights of Columbus.

==History==

===Home of the New Jersey Cardinals (1993–2005)===

Ground was broken in the fall of 1993 for a new minor league ballpark. The Hamilton Redbirds, the Cardinals&#x27; New York–Penn League affiliate, were in a transition to move out of their home in Hamilton, Ontario, to Augusta, New Jersey, and had temporarily spent the 1993 season in Glens Falls, New York, as the Glens Falls Redbirds. As part of the move, the team changed its name to the Cardinals. The team&#x27;s new home stadium would be privately owned and financed, a rarity in professional sports circles.

The park is designed to look a little bit like a farm complex from the outside. Augusta has long been the home of dairy farms, and the Cardinals wanted to make their stadium blend in.

The winter of 1993–94 brought the worst weather in several years to North Jersey, causing construction cost overruns. The owners of Skylands Stadium were forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but the new ballpark managed to open on time that June and the Cardinals moved in. The stadium&#x27;s luxury boxes and other amenities were not completed until the following year.

The Cardinals called Skylands Stadium home from 1994 to 2005, winning a NYPL title in their first season. After the 2005 season the team was sold to a new ownership group based in University Park, Pennsylvania, home of Penn State University, and were relocated there to become known as the State College Spikes; the team remained there until the New York-Penn League was shut down in 2020.

===Home of the Sussex Skyhawks (2006–2010)===
On January 10, 2006, it was announced that Skylands Stadium would be the home to the newly named professional baseball team called the Sussex Skyhawks of the Canadian American Association of Professional Baseball. On May 29, 2006, the Skyhawks played their first regular season game at Skylands Stadium, dropping an 18–11 decision to the North Shore Spirit. The Skyhawks won a Can-Am League championship in 2008, the ballpark&#x27;s second title. In early January 2011, it was announced that the Sussex Skyhawks would be disbanding.

===Other teams===
The Sussex County Community College (SCCC) baseball team, known as the Skylanders, plays its home games at Skylands Stadium. The Skylanders took part in the first-ever event at the ballpark, a doubleheader played on April 17, 1994. The Skyland Cardinals have also begun to play their home games in 2020 with the emergence of the All-American Baseball Challenge.

In 1998, Skylands Stadium was designated the home field for the New Jersey Diamonds of the Ladies Professional Baseball League, a league for women that began play the previous year. However, the Diamonds played only eight home games before the league folded.

In the summer of 1999, Skylands Stadium hosted several home games for the Newark Bears, a minor league team affiliated with the Atlantic League, as they awaited the completion of Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium in Newark.

Skylands Stadium also hosted the Sussex County Colonels of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League, a collegiate summer baseball league, from 1995 to 1997. Skylands Stadium was also home to the Semi-Pro Football team the Sussex Stags. The Stags played at the stadium in 2010 when they were called the Jersey Stags. In 2015, the Stags re-branded as the Sussex Stags and played the 2015 season at Skylands Stadium while being part of the Empire Football League, the oldest running league in the Country. The Sussex Stags now call Newton High School the home stadium and in 2019 became the New Jersey Stags.

No professional baseball team played at Skylands Stadium from 2011 through 2014. The owners, Millennium Sports Management, put the stadium up for sale for $1.99 million, but no buyer was found at that price.
In March 2013, investor Mark Roscioli of 17 Mile LLC in Ardmore, Pennsylvania acquired the stadium for $950,000. Negotiations were ongoing to determine how to bring baseball back to the site with either a new or existing pro league. Roscioli did not have prior experience running a ballpark. There was interest in a new ACBL franchise or a team in a revived version of the Northern League. In October 2014, Roscioli sold the park to a group of investors led by Al Dorso for $850,000.
===Home of the Sussex County Miners (2015–present)===
The Can-Am League granted an expansion franchise to the new ballpark owners. The new Sussex County Miners played their first home game on Memorial Day, May 25, 2015. The Miners defeated their geographical rivals, the New Jersey Jackals 4–1 in front of a crowd of 3,819 people for their first victory. In 2017, the Miners qualified for the playoffs for the first time in franchise history, playing their first playoff game at the stadium on September 7, 2017. However, the Miners got swept in the first round 3–0 by the eventual champions, the Québec Capitales.

The Miners qualified for the playoffs again the following year, this time placing first in the league and winning the division for the first time in franchise history. In the opening round, they defeated the Trois-Rivières Aigles 3–2. 

In the championship round, the Miners beat the defending Champion Québec Capitales 3 games to 1 in a best-of-five series. Skylands Stadium served as the location for games 3 and 4, each resulting in a walk-off hit in the bottom of the ninth inning. The Miners won Game 3 on a single by first baseman Daniel Mateo. Game 4 was filled with even more drama. With the Miners down two runs with two on and two out with a sold out crowd, the Miners third baseman Martin Figueroa stepped to the plate to hit a dramatic first-pitch, three-run home run, ending the game with a score of 6-5 and giving the Miners their first championship in franchise history.

On Sunday, June 16, 2019, the Sussex County Miners defeated the Shikoku Island Independents by a score of 5–2, exactly 25 years to the date of the first professional game played at Skylands Park which was between the New Jersey Cardinals and Hudson Valley Renegades.

After the 2019 season, the Can-Am League ceased operations, with the Miners and other teams slated to join the Frontier League. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Frontier League cancelled its 2020 season. The Miners instead fielded a team in the hastily-assembled All-American Baseball Challenge, hosting games at Skylands Stadium despite a limit of 500 fans due to pandemic restrictions. The Miners officially began play in the Frontier League in May 2021.

<text>Paper football (also called finger football, flick football, tabletop football, thump football, or freaky football) refers to a table-top game, loosely based on American football, in which a sheet of paper folded into a small triangle is slid back and forth across a table top by two opponents. This game is widely practiced for entertainment, mostly by students in primary, middle school (junior high), and high school age in the United States. Though its origin is in dispute, it was widely played at churches in Madison, Wisconsin in the early 1970s. The youth group at Grace Baptist Church held weekly events and competitions including monthly championships.

== Gameplay ==
The game uses a piece of paper folded into a triangle, called the &quot;ball&quot;. The starting player begins by kicking off the ball. To perform a kickoff, the ball is placed on the table, suspended by one of the player&#x27;s hands with the index finger on the upper tip of the ball, then the player flicks the ball with the other hand&#x27;s thumb and index finger. If the ball ends up flying off the table or hanging on the edge of the table, the kickoff is redone. If the ball lands on the table without reaching the edge of the receiving player&#x27;s side, players take turns pushing it with a steady fast motion towards the opponent&#x27;s side.

The player scores points by getting the ball hanging on the edge of the opponent&#x27;s side, called a touchdown. Every time a touchdown is scored, the player who scored has a chance to make a field goal, which has that player flick the ball as in the kickoff through the opponent&#x27;s goal post, formed by placing both wrists parallel to the table on the edge, with the tips of both thumbs touching each other and both index fingers pointing straight upward. If the field goal is successful, the kicking player scores one point. The player who conceded points starts the next kickoff.

The game ends based on the agreed-upon rules, be it time limit (the player with the most points when the predetermined amount of time has elapsed wins) or score limit (the first player to reach the predetermined score threshold wins).

<doc id="625425" wikidata="Q7265650" url="?curid=625425" title="Q Score">
<text>The Q Score (popularly known as Q-Rating) is a measurement of the familiarity and appeal of a brand, celebrity, company, or entertainment product (e.g., television show) used in the United States. The more highly regarded the item or person is, the higher the Q Score among those who are aware of the subject. Q Scores and other variants are primarily used by the advertising, marketing, media, and public relations industries.

==Usage==
The Q Score is a metric that determines a &quot;quotient&quot; (&quot;Q&quot;) factor through mail and online panelists who make up representative samples of the population. The score identifies the familiarity of an athlete, brand, celebrity, poet, entertainment offering (e.g., television show), or licensed property, and measures the appeal of each among people familiar with the entity being measured. Other popular synonyms include Q rating, Q factor, and simply Q.

==History==

The Q Score was developed in 1963 by Jack Landis and is owned by Marketing Evaluations, Inc, the company he founded in 1964. Q Scores are calculated for the population as a whole as well as by demographic groups such as age, education level, gender, income, or marital status.

==Calculation==

Q Score respondents are given choices for each person or item being surveyed:    A. One of my favorites.   B. Very Good   C. Good   D. Fair   E. Poor   F. Never heard of

The &quot;positive&quot; Q Score is calculated by counting how many respondents answered A divided by the number of respondents answering A-E, and calculating the percentage. (that is, multiplying the fraction by 100). Put another way, formula_1

Similarly, the &quot;negative&quot; Q Score is calculated by calculating the percentage of respondents who answered D or E relative to respondents who answered A to E.
formula_2

==Alternatives==

Other companies have created alternative measures and metrics related to the likability, popularity, and appeal of athletes, brands, celebrities, entertainment offerings, or licensed properties. Marketing Evaluations claims the Q Score is more valuable to marketers than other popularity measurements, such as the Nielsen ratings, because Q Scores indicate not only how many people are &quot;aware of&quot; or &quot;watch a show&quot; but also how those people &quot;feel about&quot; the entity being measured. A well-liked television show, for example, may be worth more as a commercial vehicle to an advertiser than a higher-rated show that people don’t like as much. Emotional bonding with a show means stronger viewer involvement and audience attention, which are very desirable to sponsors. Viewers who regard the show as a &quot;favorite&quot; have higher awareness of the show&#x27;s commercial content.

==Forms==
Marketing Evaluations regularly calculates Q Scores in eight categories:

* &quot;Brand Attachment Q&quot; rates brand and company names
* &quot;Cable Q&quot; rates cable television programs
* &quot;Cartoon Q&quot; rates cartoon characters, video games, toys and similar products
* &quot;Dead Q&quot; rates the current popularity of deceased celebrities
* &quot;Kids Product Q&quot; rates children&#x27;s responses to brand and company names
* &quot;Performer Q&quot; rates living celebrities
* &quot;Sports Q&quot; rates sports figures
* &quot;TVQ&quot; rates broadcast television programs

Cable Q and TVQ scores are calculated for all regularly scheduled broadcast and cable shows.

Other Q Scores are calculated to order for clients who want to research public perception of a brand or celebrity. For example, in 2000, IBM hired Marketing Evaluations to calculate the Q Score for Deep Blue, the supercomputer that defeated chess Grandmaster Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue’s Q Score was 9, meaning the computer was as familiar and appealing at the time as Carmen Electra, Howard Stern, and Bruce Wayne. In contrast, Albert Einstein’s Q Score at the time was 56, while Larry Ellison and Scott McNealy each received a Q Score of 6.

<doc id="625435" wikidata="Q159252" url="?curid=625435" title="Chukchi Sea">
<text>The Chukchi Sea (, ), sometimes referred to as the Chuuk Sea, Chukotsk Sea or the Sea of Chukotsk, is a marginal sea of the Arctic Ocean. It is bounded on the west by the Long Strait, off Wrangel Island, and in the east by Point Barrow, Alaska, beyond which lies the Beaufort Sea. The Bering Strait forms its southernmost limit and connects it to the Bering Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The principal port on the Chukchi Sea is Uelen in Russia. The International Date Line crosses the Chukchi Sea from northwest to southeast. It is displaced eastwards to avoid Wrangel Island as well as the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug on the Russian mainland.

==Etymology==
In 1928, during hydrographic observations, the Norwegian polar explorer Harald Sverdrup discovered that the sea lying between Point Barrow and Wrangel Island was very different from the sea between the New Siberian Islands and Wrangel Island and therefore should be separated from the East Siberian Sea. It was decided to call the newly separated sea by the name of the people living on the Chukotka Peninsula. This name was officially approved in 1935.

==Geography==

The sea has an approximate area of and is only navigable about four months of the year. The main geological feature of the Chukchi Sea bottom is the Hope Basin, which is bound to the northeast by the Herald Arch. Depths less than occupy 56% of the total area.

The Chukchi Sea has very few islands compared to other seas of the Arctic. Wrangel Island lies at the northwestern limit of the sea, Herald Island is located off Wrangel Island&#x27;s Waring Point, near the northern limit of the sea. A few small islands lie along the Siberian and Alaskan coasts.

The sea is named after the Chukchi people, who reside on its shores and on the Chukotka Peninsula. The coastal Chukchi traditionally engaged in fishing, whaling and the hunting of walrus in this cold sea.

In Siberia places along the coast are: Cape Billings, Cape Schmidt, Amguyema River, Cape Vankarem, the large Kolyuchinskaya Bay, Neskynpil&#x27;gyn Lagoon, Cape Serdtse-Kamen, Enurmino, Chegitun River, Inchoun, Uelen and Cape Dezhnev.

In Alaska, the rivers flowing into the Chukchi Sea are the Kivalina, the Kobuk, the Kokolik, the Kukpowruk, the Kukpuk, the Noatak, the Utukok, the Pitmegea, and the Wulik, among others. Of rivers flowing in from its Siberian side, the Amguyema, Ioniveyem, and the Chegitun are the most important.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the &quot;Chuckchi Sea&quot; as follows:

Common usage is that the southern extent is further south, at the narrowest part of the Bering Strait which is on the 66th parallel north.

===Chukchi Sea Shelf===

The Chukchi Sea Shelf is the westernmost part of the continental shelf of the United States and the easternmost part of the continental shelf of Russia. Within this shelf, the Chukchi Corridor acts as a passageway for one of the largest marine mammal migrations in the world. Species that have been documented migrating through this corridor include the bowhead whale, beluga whale, Pacific walrus, and bearded seals

==History==

In 1648, Semyon Dezhnyov sailed from the Kolyma River on the Arctic to the Anadyr River on the Pacific, but his route was not practical and was not used for the next 200 years. In 1728, Vitus Bering and in 1779, Captain James Cook entered the sea from the Pacific.

On 28 September 1878, during Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld&#x27;s expedition that made the whole length of the Northeast passage for the first time in history, the steamship &quot;Vega&quot; got stuck in fast ice in the Chukchi Sea. Since further progress for that year was impossible, the ship was secured in winter quarters. Even so, members of the expedition and the crew were aware only a few miles of ice-blocked sea lay between them and the open waters. The following year, two days after &quot;Vega&quot; was released, she passed the Bering Strait and steamed towards the Pacific Ocean.

In 1913, &quot;Karluk&quot;, abandoned by expedition leader Vilhjalmur Stefansson, drifted in the ice along the northern expanses of the Chukchi Sea and sank, crushed by ice near Herald Island. The survivors made it to Wrangel Island, where they found themselves in a hopeless situation. Then Captain Robert Bartlett walked hundreds of kilometers with Kataktovik, an Inuk man, on the ice of the Chukchi Sea in order to look for help. They reached Cape Vankarem on the Chukotka coast, on April 15, 1914. Twelve survivors of the ill-fated expedition were found on Wrangel island nine months later by the &quot;King &amp; Winge&quot;, a newly built Arctic fishing schooner.

In 1933, the steamer &quot;Chelyuskin&quot; sailed from Murmansk, east bound to attempt a transit of the Northern Sea Route to the Pacific, in order to demonstrate such a transit could be achieved in one season. The vessel became beset in heavy ice in the Chukchi Sea, and after drifting with the ice for over two months, was crushed and sank on 13 February 1934 near Kolyuchin Island. Apart from one fatality, her entire complement of 104 was able to establish a camp on the sea ice. The Soviet government organized an impressive aerial evacuation, under which all were rescued. Captain Vladimir Voronin and expedition leader Otto Schmidt became heroes.

Following several unsuccessful attempts, the wreck was located on the bed of the Chukchi Sea by a Russian expedition, Chelyuskin-70, in mid-September 2006. Two small components of the ship&#x27;s superstructure were recovered by divers and were sent to the ship&#x27;s builders, Burmeister &amp; Wain of Copenhagen, for identification.

In July 2009, a large mass of organic material was found floating in the sea off the northwest Alaskan coast. Analysis by the U.S. Coast Guard has identified it as a large body of algal bloom.

On 15 October 2010, Russian scientists opened a floating polar research station in the Chukchi Sea at the margin of the Arctic Ocean. The name of the station was Severny Polyus-38 and it was home to 15 researchers for a year. They conducted polar studies and gathered scientific evidence to reinforce Russia&#x27;s claims to the Arctic.

==Fauna==
The polar bears living on the pack ice of the Chukchi Sea are one of the five genetically distinct Eurasian populations of the species.

==Phytoplankton==

In 2012, scientists from the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory published findings describing the discovery of the largest-known oceanic phytoplankton algal bloom in the world. The findings were unexpected as it was previously believed that the plankton grows only after the seasonal ice melt, yet some algae was discovered under several metres of intact sea ice.

Anderson et al 2021 documents two cyst beds of the dinoflagellate &quot;Alexandrium catenella&quot; in Ledyard Bay and Barrow Canyon within the Chukchi sea. Although the cyst beds consist of &quot;A. catenella&quot; in a dormant state, if environmental conditions are right, they can germinate and create harmful algal blooms. In its active state, &quot;A. catenella&quot; produces saxitoxin, a potent neurotoxin that is responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) if consumed. The toxin can bioaccumulate through the food-chain and poses a threat to local communities that rely on the marine food web for sustenance.

The total area of the cyst beds is 145,600 km2, comparable to the area of the state of Iowa. These beds are six times larger than previously reported beds in other areas, and cyst concentration in the sediment is among the highest globally. Germination can only occur in the upper few millimeters of a bed, as cysts must be in oxic conditions to enter their more active life stage in which reproduction is possible.

At bottom water temperatures of approximately 3 °C, &quot;A. catenella&quot; cysts take approximately 28 days to germinate, and at bottom water temperatures of 8°, the germination time is shortened to 10 days. In situ blooms in 2018 and 2019 have been attributed to these cyst beds and occurred in the months of July and August. With warmer summer water temperatures and increasingly destabilized oceanic currents associated with climate change, bloom initiation has been advanced by three weeks over the last two decades, and the time window for harmful surface blooms has been extended.

==Oil and gas resources==
The Chukchi shelf is believed to hold oil and gas reserves as high as . Several oil companies have competed for leases on the area, and on 6 February 2008, the U.S. government announced the successful bidders would pay US$2.6 billion for extraction rights. The auction drew considerable criticism from environmentalists. In May 2015, the Obama administration&#x27;s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management gave a conditional approval for Shell Oil to drill in shallow ( deep) Chukchi Sea waters. In September 2015, Shell announced that it was ending its oil exploration in the region, citing tremendous cost and declining oil prices. Shell vowed to return, but eventually gave up all but one of the corporation&#x27;s leases in the Arctic.

<text>Sir John Richardson FRS FRSE (5 November 1787 – 5 June 1865) was a Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and Arctic explorer.

==Life==
Richardson was born at Nith Place in Dumfries the son of Gabriel Richardson, Provost of Dumfries, and his wife, Anne Mundell. He was educated at Dumfries Grammar School. He was then apprenticed to his maternal uncle, Dr James Mundell, a surgeon in Dumfries.

Richardson studied medicine at Edinburgh University, and became a surgeon in the navy in 1807. He traveled with John Franklin in search of the Northwest Passage on the Coppermine Expedition of 1819–1822. Richardson wrote the sections on geology, botany and ichthyology for the official account of the expedition.

Franklin and Richardson returned to Canada in 1825 and went overland by fur trade routes to the mouth of the Mackenzie River. Franklin was to go as far west as possible and Richardson was to go east to the mouth of the Coppermine River. These were the only known points on the central coast and had been reached in 1793 and 1771 respectively. He had with him two specially-built boats which were more ocean-worthy than the voyageur canoes used by Franklin on his previous expedition. They gave their names to the Dolphin and Union Strait near the end of his route.

Richardson&#x27;s journey was successful and he reached his furthest east the same day that Franklin reached his furthest west (16 August 1826). He abandoned his boats at Bloody Falls and trekked overland to Fort Franklin which he reached three weeks before Franklin. Together they had surveyed of previously unmapped coast. The natural history discoveries of this expedition were so great that they had to be recorded in two separate works, the &quot;Flora Boreali-Americana&quot; (1833–40), written by William Jackson Hooker, and the &quot;Fauna Boreali-Americana&quot; (1829–37), written by Richardson, William Swainson, John Edward Gray and William Kirby.

At the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting in 1842, Richardson described the diving apparatus and treatment of diver Roderick Cameron following an injury that occurred on 14 October 1841 during the salvage operations on .

Richardson was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1846. He traveled with John Rae on an unsuccessful search for Franklin in 1848–49, describing it in &quot;An Arctic Searching Expedition&quot; (1851).

Richardson retired to the Lake District in 1855. While there, Richardson (helped by his daughter Beatrice) send words for inclusion in the OED. This was in response to a public appeal by editor James Murray for volunteers to contribute words; several thousand were recruited. Richardson&#x27;s contribution totalled 23,568. The stories of many such volunteers are told by Sarah Ogilvie in her book &quot;The Dictionary People&quot;.

Richardson died at his home Lancrigg House north of Grasmere on 5 June 1865, and is buried at St Oswald&#x27;s Church, Grasmere.

==Family==
Richardson married three times: firstly in 1818 to Mary Stiven; secondly in 1833 to Mary Booth; and finally in 1847 to Mary Fletcher.

==Works==
Richardson also wrote accounts dealing with the natural history, and especially the ichthyology, of several other Arctic voyages, and was the author of &quot;Icones Piscium&quot; (1843), &quot;Catalogue of Apodal Fish in the British Museum&quot; (1856), the second edition of Yarrell&#x27;s &quot;History of British Fishes&quot; (1860), &quot;The Polar Regions&quot; (1861). and &quot;Arctic Ordeal: The Journal of John Richardson&quot; Edited by C. Stuart Houston (1984). The National Marine Biological Library at the Marine Biological Association retains some original illustrations used by Richardson in preparation for the second edition of Yarrell&#x27;s book.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation is a standing committee of the United States Senate. Besides having broad jurisdiction over all matters concerning interstate commerce, science and technology policy, and transportation, the Senate Commerce Committee is one of the largest of the Senate&#x27;s standing committees, with 28 members in the 117th Congress. The Commerce Committee has six subcommittees. It is chaired by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) with Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) as Ranking Member. The majority office is housed in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, and the minority office is located in the Hart Senate Office Building.

==History==
The committee has its roots in the Committee on Commerce and Manufacturers, which served as a standing committee in the early-1800s. This committee was split in two in the 1820s and remained in this configuration until the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. Under the LRA, the number of standing committees was dramatically decreased to increase congressional efficiency and increase institutional strength. As a result, the Committee on Commerce, the Committee on Manufactures, the Committee on Interstate Commerce, and the Committee on Interoceanic Canals were combined into the United States Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. In 1977, as a part of widespread committee reorganization, the committee was renamed the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and given additional oversight jurisdiction over nonmilitary aeronautical and space sciences, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

The original progenitors of this committee were:
* United States Senate Committee on Commerce and Manufactures (1816–1825)
* United States Senate Committee on Commerce (1825–1946, 1961–1977)
* United States Senate Committee on Manufactures (1825–1855, 1864–1946)
* United States Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce (1885–1946)
* United States Senate Committee on Interoceanic Canals (1899–1946)
* United States Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce (1946–1961)
* United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences (1958–1977)

==Jurisdiction==

# &quot;Coast Guard;
