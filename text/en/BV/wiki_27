<text>Giuseppe &quot;Beppe&quot; Bergomi (; born 22 December 1963) is an Italian former professional footballer who spent his entire career at Inter Milan. He is regarded as one of the greatest Italian defenders of all time, and as one of the best of his generation, being elected by Pelé to be part of the FIFA 100 in 2004.

A one-club man, Bergomi held the record of most appearances for the club for several years, while also being the side&#x27;s longtime captain. He was affectionately referred to as &quot;Lo zio&quot; (&quot;the uncle&quot;) because of his bushy eyebrows and the impressive moustache he wore even as a youngster, which reminded teammate Gianpiero Marini of his own uncle&#x27;s appearance.

Bergomi works as a pundit at Sky Sports Italia and frequently co-commentates on Serie A matches alongside Fabio Caressa.

==Club career==
Born in Milan, Bergomi began training with Inter Milan&#x27;s first team at the age of only 16, and made his professional debut in the 1979–80 Coppa Italia against rivals Juventus in Turin, on 30 January 1980. During the 1980–81 season, at the age of 17, he made his first Serie A appearance in a 2–1 home win over Como on 22 February 1981. After winning the Coppa Italia the following year, also reaching the semifinals of the European Cup whilst putting on consistent performances, he soon was part of Italy&#x27;s senior squad choices.

Bergomi would go on to spend his entire career with Inter, later becoming team captain. The twenty Serie A campaigns in which he competed were often in the shadow of A.C. Milan, as he only won the &quot;Scudetto&quot; once, during a record-breaking campaign in 1988–89; he did, however, conquer the UEFA Cup on three occasions (1990–91, 1993–94, and 1997–98, also reaching the final for a fourth time in 1997). For a time, he held the records for both the most appearances in European competition by an Italian player and the most Milan derbies played, both later broken by Paolo Maldini.

Bergomi retired in 1999 at the age of almost 36, holding the record of most appearances for Inter (758) until late September 2011, when he was overtaken by Javier Zanetti. He also scored 28 goals for the club. With 96 appearances, he currently holds the record for most appearances in the UEFA Cup. In total, he made 117 appearances in UEFA club competitions, without scoring a goal. In March 2004 he was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers.

==International career==
With Italy Bergomi won the 1982 FIFA World Cup. He also played in the 1986 and 1990 campaigns (acting as captain in the latter), as well as UEFA Euro 1988, with the nation reaching the semi-finals of the latter two tournaments. His final international tournament was the 1998 World Cup.

Alongside the likes of Inter&#x27;s Giuseppe Baresi, his younger brother Franco of A.C. Milan and Juventus trio of Antonio Cabrini, Claudio Gentile and Gaetano Scirea, he formed the backbone of the national team&#x27;s defence for much of the 1980s, making his debut on 14 April 1982 in a 0–1 friendly loss in East Germany, aged only 18 years and 3 months, making him the youngest player to feature in a match for Italy post-World War II. He was included in the Italy team for the World Cup in Spain later that year, becoming the youngest Italian player ever to be called up for a World Cup. In the victorious tournament, he appeared in three games, including Italy&#x27;s 3–2 second round victory against Brazil in their final group match, where he put in a strong performance after coming on for the injured defender Fulvio Collovati, marking opposing striker Serginho Chulapa, despite later deflecting Paulo Roberto Falcão&#x27;s shot into his own net; the result allowed Italy to advance to the semi-final ahead of Brazil and Argentina in the so-called &quot;Group of Death.&quot; At the age of 18 years and 195 days, Bergomi was the youngest Italian player ever to have appeared at a World Cup. Although he was initially not in manager Enzo Bearzot&#x27;s plans to feature in the knock-out rounds, Bergomi also went on to play the full 180 minutes in the last two matches of the tournament. Due to Gentile&#x27;s suspension ahead of the semi-final against Poland, coupled with an injury to goalkeeper Dino Zoff, which impeded him from taking goal kicks, Bergomi started the match, keeping a clean sheet in the 2–0 victory. An injury to playmaker Giancarlo Antognoni also allowed Bergomi to start in the 3–1 final victory over West Germany, where he effectively marked German forward Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, despite picking up a minor injury in the first half, and even participated in the lead-up to the second goal of the match, scored by Marco Tardelli. Aged 18 years and 201 days, at the time, he was the second youngest player ever to win the title, after Brazil&#x27;s Pelé, who won the tournament at the age of 17 years and 249 days in 1958.

Bergomi also appeared in the 1986 edition of the tournament, where Italy were eliminated in the round-of-16 by eventual semi-finalists France following a 2–0 loss.

During the first match under Bearzot&#x27;s successor, Azeglio Vicini, Bergomi scored his first two goals for Italy in a 2–0 friendly win against Greece in Bologna on 8 October 1986, becoming the first Italian defender to score a brace at international level; he also wore the captain&#x27;s armband for the first time, following striker Alessandro Altobelli&#x27;s substitution. On 20 February 1988, Bergomi was named Italy captain ahead of Italy&#x27;s 4–1 friendly win over the USSR in Bari, a role he held for 33 games, until 1991. As captain, Bergomi was part of Italy&#x27;s Euro 88 squad under Vicini, where the nation reached the semi-finals, before suffering a 2–0 defeat to the Soviet Union; Bergomi was elected part of the team of the tournament.

Bergomi went on to captain his country in the 1990 World Cup – held on home soil – to a third-place finish, playing in all seven matches, which included five consecutive wins and as many clean sheets, for a total of 518 minutes without conceding a goal, and the best defensive record overall in the history of the competition, conceding only two goals in total. Italy were eliminated in the semi-finals by defending champions Argentina on penalties, following a 1–1 draw, the only match that Italy did not win throughout the competition. Italy went on to win the bronze medal match 2–1 over England.

After being sent off in a 2–1 away defeat against Norway for the Euro 1992 qualifiers on 5 June 1991 (Vicini&#x27;s second-last match as Italy coach), following a clash with Erik Pedersen and an ensuing altercation with Gøran Sørloth, resulting in a six-match ban, Bergomi spent years without being called up to the &quot;Azzurri&quot;; this was in part due to subsequent Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi&#x27;s preference for a zonal rather than man-marking defensive system, following Italy&#x27;s failure to qualify for UEFA Euro 1992.

However, Bergomi was surprisingly selected by Cesare Maldini for the 1998 World Cup at age 34, due to an injury to Ciro Ferrara, after playing 28 times in the league and leading the &quot;Nerazzurri&quot; to the UEFA Cup – his third and last edition of the tournament. After appearing in a pre-tournament friendly against Sweden, which ended in a 1–0 defeat, in France, Bergomi started off as a reserve, but was substituted in during the last group stage match against Austria, when Alessandro Nesta suffered a tournament-ending injury, with Italy winning the match 2–1. He partnered for the rest of the tournament with Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta and Maldini, playing three games in total, starting in the 1–0 win over Norway in the round of 16, and leading Italy to a quarter-final finish, where they would be eliminated by hosts and eventual champions France 4–3 on penalties on 3 July, following a goalless draw; this would be his 81st and final international appearance, to which he added six goals in total. At the time, he was Italy&#x27;s fourth–most capped player of all time, alongside Franco Baresi and Tardelli.

Along with Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro, Paolo Maldini, and Gianni Rivera, Bergomi is one of only five Italian players to have appeared in four editions of the FIFA World Cup. However, despite playing in four editions of the tournament, Bergomi failed to make one single appearance in the qualifying stages.

==Style of play==
Bergomi was an extremely versatile defender, who was capable of playing anywhere along the backline and adapting to any formation: although he was primarily a right-back, he was equally capable of playing on the left, as a central defender, or even as a sweeper, positions in which he was often deployed both at club and international level. A quick, athletic, consistent and hard-working player, who was also strong in the air, in addition to his defensive ability, as a full-back he was also known for his strength, stamina and his ability to make attacking runs up the flank, and was also capable of contributing to his team&#x27;s offensive plays with goals and assists, courtesy of his good right foot, crossing ability and powerful shot from outside the area. Above all, however, Bergomi was known for his excellent man-marking skills as a &quot;stopper&quot;, although he was later also able to excel in a zonal marking system; he was also highly regarded for his timing of his challenges and his anticipation.

Despite having a strong temper and being a hard tackler − he was sent off 12 times in his career − Bergomi also distinguished himself by his fairness, professionalism and discipline, which made him well-respected among teammates, opponents and coaches; he was also regarded for his &#x27;silent leadership&#x27; throughout his career. Because of his physical and tenacious playing style, in 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; placed him at number nine in their list of the 50 hardest football players in history.

A precocious talent in his youth (when he had initially started out as a forward), Bergomi later also stood out for his longevity throughout his extensive career; indeed, his experience, tactical intelligence and positional sense, as well as his confidence on the ball, balance, technique and his ability to play the ball out from the back-line enabled him to excel as a sweeper towards the end of his career, and maintain a high level of performance, in spite of his loss of pace as a result of his physical decline.

==Post-playing career==
A licensed football coach, Bergomi became youth coach of the &quot;Esordienti&quot; at Inter in 2008. In July 2009 he was appointed youth coach of &quot;Allievi Nazionali&quot; (under-17) at Monza, being promoted as head of the &quot;Berretti&quot; under-19 team, in co-operation with Giuseppe Chieppa, one year later.

In July 2011, Bergomi left Monza to accept the same position at Atalanta. Additionally, he also worked as a football pundit and commentator for Italian satellite television Sky Italia, often commentating with Fabio Caressa, including in Italy&#x27;s victorious run at the 2006 World Cup.

==Personal life==
Bergomi is married to Daniela; they have two children: Andrea and Sara.

In May 2020, Bergomi revealed that he had recovered from COVID-19, after contracting it following its outbreak in Italy.

<text>USS &quot;Cassin&quot; (DD-372) was a in the United States Navy before and during World War II. She was the second ship named for Stephen Cassin, an officer in the United States Navy.

&quot;Cassin&quot; was launched at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 28 October 1935. She was sponsored by Stephen Cassin&#x27;s great granddaughter, Mrs. Helen Cassin Carusi Lombard, and commissioned 21 August 1936, with Lieutenant Commander A. G. Noble in command. Mrs. Lombard, at age nine, had also sponsored the first in 1913.

==Service history==
&quot;Cassin&quot; underwent alterations until March 1937, then cruised to the Caribbean and Brazil.

On 18 August 1937 the &quot;Cassin&quot; was in dry dock #2 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard when she suffered a ruptured steam line. Four civilians in the engine room were killed. Ten more, both sailors and civilians were injured.

In April 1938 she joined the fleet at Pearl Harbor for the annual fleet exercises in the Hawaiian Islands and the Panama Canal Zone. During 1939, she operated on the West Coast with torpedo and gunnery schools, and on 1 April 1940 was assigned to the Hawaiian Detachment. &quot;Cassin&quot; sailed on maneuvers and patrol in the Pacific, cruising from February to April 1941 to Samoa, Australia, and Fiji. Fall of 1941 found her calling at West Coast ports.

===World War II===

&quot;Cassin&quot; was in drydock with and at Pearl Harbor during the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941. During the attack, a low order detonation by a bomb on &quot;Downes&quot; ruptured her fuel tanks, causing uncontrollable fires on board both &quot;Downes&quot; and &quot;Cassin&quot;. &quot;Cassin&quot; slipped from her keel blocks and rested against &quot;Downes&quot;. Both ships were considered lost, and &quot;Cassin&quot; was decommissioned as of 7 December 1941. Both ship&#x27;s hulls were damaged beyond repair but machinery and equipment were salvaged and sent to Mare Island Navy Yard where entirely new ships were built around the salvaged material and given the wrecked ship&#x27;s names and hull numbers.
Recommissioned 5 February 1944, &quot;Cassin&quot; reported at Pearl Harbor 22 April, and was assigned escort duty from Majuro until August. By shooting out caves and bombarding Aguijan, she aided in the consolidation of Tinian from 15 – 25 August, and then assumed escort duties out of Saipan. She took part in the bombardment of Marcus Island on 9 October. With the same force which had struck at Marcus, &quot;Cassin&quot; sailed on to join TG 38.1 on 16 October. &quot;Cassin&quot; steamed northeast of Luzon during the Leyte landings, and when the landings had been successfully launched, was dispatched with her group to refuel and replenish at Ulithi. However, when TF 38 made contact with the Japanese Center Force rounding the southern cape of Mindoro, bound for its part in the Battle for Leyte Gulf, &quot;Cassin&quot;″s group was recalled to join the approaching action. In the afternoon of 25 October, her group at last reached position to launch aircraft which attacked the Japanese ships in one of the longest-range carrier strikes of the war.

&quot;Cassin&quot;″s next assignment was to the preparations for the assault on Iwo Jima. On the night of 11–12 November 1944, and again on 24 January 1945, she bombarded the island, and otherwise engaged in patrol, escort, and radar picket duties around Saipan. On 23 February, she sailed from Saipan to escort an ammunition ship to newly invaded Iwo Jima, returning to Guam 28 February with a hospital ship. She returned to Iwo Jima in mid-March for radar picket and air-sea rescue duty. With periods at Guam and Saipan for replenishment and repairs, she continued on this duty through most of the remainder of the war.

&quot;Cassin&quot; endured a typhoon on 6 June 1945, losing one of her men (and a motor whaleboat) overboard. On 20 July, she bombarded Kita-Iwō-jima, and on 7 August, she boarded and searched a Japanese hospital ship to ensure compliance with international law. Since there were no violations, she allowed the ship to proceed on its way. With the war over, &quot;Cassin&quot; continued air-sea rescue off Iwo Jima, guarding the air evacuation of released prisoners of war from Japan.

==Fate==
She returned to Norfolk, Virginia, 1 November 1945, and was decommissioned there 17 December 1945. &quot;Cassin&quot; was sold for scrap on 25 November 1947. The Ensign that was flying on the ship during the attack on Pearl Harbor is currently displayed in the Jerry Falwell Library on the campus of Liberty University. Her ship&#x27;s bell resides at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Suitland, MD.

==Awards==
&quot;Cassin&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service.

<doc id="615860" wikidata="Q2884670" url="?curid=615860" title="Barnardo's">
<text>Barnardo&#x27;s is a global charity headquartered in Barkingside in the London Borough of Redbridge. It was founded by Thomas John Barnardo in 1866, to care for vulnerable children. As of 2013, it raised and spent around £200 million each year running around 900 local services, aimed at helping these same groups. It is the largest children&#x27;s charity in the UK in terms of charitable expenditure. 

==History==
The National Incorporated Association for the Reclamation of Destitute Waif Children otherwise known as Dr. Barnardo&#x27;s Homes was founded by Irish born doctor Thomas Barnardo, who opened a school in the East End of London to care for and educate children of the area left orphaned and destitute by a recent cholera outbreak. In 1870 he founded a boys&#x27; orphanage at 18 Stepney Causeway and later opened a girls&#x27; home. By the time of his death in 1905, Barnardo&#x27;s institutions cared for over 8,500 children in 96 locations. His work was carried on by his many supporters under the name Dr. Barnardo&#x27;s Homes National Incorporated Association. Following societal changes in the mid-20th century, the charity changed its focus from the direct care of children to fostering and adoption, renaming itself Dr. Barnardo&#x27;s in 1965. Following the closure of its last traditional orphanage in 1988, it took the still simpler name of Barnardo&#x27;s. The official mascot of Barnardo&#x27;s is a bear called Barney. Its chief executive is Javed Khan.

There was controversy early on with Barnardo&#x27;s work. Specifically, he was accused of kidnapping children without parents&#x27; permission and of falsifying photographs of children to make the distinction between the period before they were rescued by Barnardo&#x27;s and afterwards seem more dramatic. He openly confessed to the former of these charges, describing it as &quot;philanthropic abduction&quot; and basing his defence on the idea that the ends justified the means. In all, he was taken to court on 88 occasions, largely on the charge of kidnapping. However, being a charismatic speaker and popular figure, he rode through these scandals unscathed. Other charges brought against him included neglecting basic hygiene for the children under his care.

Between 1945 and 1974, Barnardo&#x27;s supported and participated in schemes that saw around 150,000 children exported to imperial colonies where they were mostly abused, beaten and neglected.

In October 2022, Buckingham Palace announced that over 1,000 Paddington Bears and teddy bears left at royal sites after the death of Queen Elizabeth II would be donated to Barnardo&#x27;s.

=== Experience of mixed-race children ===
A &quot;special problem&quot; of the upbringing and socialisation of mixed-race children was noted in Barnardo&#x27;s Annual Report of 1951.

Suzi Hamilton was sent to Barnardo&#x27;s by her married mother in 1946. Her father was a black GI. She had a tough time at home and the two employees who ran her Barnardo cottage were not nice to her. She wrote her experience into her book which also described several unsuccessful attempts to adopt her. She also talked about the short vacations that she had with her &quot;aunts&quot; and &quot;uncles&quot; where on one vacation she experienced her first menstrual period and was told to be extra careful as she was not a white girl.

Susan Tomkins, born in Taunton, Somerset to a married mother, was being sent to Barnardos when she was around eight with her two brothers. She stayed at the Barnardo&#x27;s for about a year. Her grandmother, who was protective of her in the face of any racism, took care of her once she went home.

==Communications==
Barnardo&#x27;s has used advertising campaigns to raise public awareness of its work. A 2003 advert which featured a new-born baby with a cockroach crawling out of its mouth was banned by the ASA after a storm of public protest. In 2008 its &quot;Break the cycle&quot; TV advert featuring a girl being repeatedly hit around the head by her father prompted a number of complaints but was cleared by the ASA, which said the imagery was justified, given the context.

In 2009 Martin Narey, then Chief Executive of Barnardo&#x27;s, stated that he believed that more children should be taken into care. This statement caused considerable controversy, especially as historical references were made by journalists to Barnardo&#x27;s original practice of &quot;philanthropic abduction&quot;. By 2012, there was little opposition to Narey&#x27;s claim, which was publicly supported by the NSPCC and Action For Children, who called for an overhaul of the law on neglect.

==Criticism==

===Cedars controversy===
In 2011, Barnardo&#x27;s was criticised for its work in Cedars, the name chosen by UK Immigration Enforcement for what it describes as &quot;pre-departure accommodation&quot; (detention facility) near Gatwick Airport used to hold families with children pending deportation. Barnardo&#x27;s provides &quot;welfare and social care facilities&quot; at the detention centre, which is managed on behalf of UK Visas and Immigration by private security company G4S. Barnardo&#x27;s has been criticised by Frances Webber of the Institute of Race Relations for &quot;legitimising child detention&quot;.

Anarchist extremists opposed to the detention of children, such as members of the No Border network, have mounted a campaign against the charity&#x27;s involvement in Cedars. This included actions such as occupying Barnardo&#x27;s London head office in February 2012, and disrupting the &quot;Barnardo&#x27;s Young Supporters&quot; choir concert at the Royal Albert Hall in April 2012.

In response to criticism, Anne Marie Carrie, then Chief Executive of Barnardo&#x27;s, stated that the decision to provide welfare and social care services at Cedars is in the children&#x27;s best interests, outlining Barnardo&#x27;s &quot;red lines&quot; and the action it will take if the welfare and dignity of any asylum seeking families and children is at risk.

===Child physical and sexual abuse===
The 2014–2015 Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry included 
Barnardo&#x27;s Sharonmore Project, Newtownabbey and Barnardo&#x27;s Macedon, Newtownabbey among the institutions under investigation. The charity was aware of child abuse but did not retain the records, as the evidence could have been used in court. Barnardo&#x27;s was also implicated in this inquiry for sending British children to Australia in the mid-20th century, where some were tortured, raped and enslaved. Barnardo&#x27;s acknowledges its role in this &quot;well intentioned&quot; but &quot;deeply misguided&quot; policy supported by the government of the time.

Barnardo&#x27;s was further scrutinised in 2018, as investigations and inquiries into failures in NGO safeguarding expanded.

In 2020 the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry issued a report which included Barnardo&#x27;s homes at Tyneholm, Balcary, Glasclune and Craigerne in Scotland. The Inquiry concluded that children in the care of these homes in the 1950s and 1960s suffered emotional, sexual and physical abuse.

====Apology====
Martin Crewe, the head of Barnardo&#x27;s Scotland, said in 2020: &quot;We absolutely apologise for what happened to those individuals. Any instance of abuse is absolutely unacceptable.&quot;

On 11 March 2022 ministers from the five main political parties in Northern Ireland and six abusing institutions made statements of apology in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The six institutions that apologised for carrying out abuse were De La Salle Brothers, represented by Br Francis Manning; the Sisters of Nazareth, represented by Sr Cornelia Walsh; the Sisters of St Louis represented by Sr Uainin Clarke; the Good Shepherd Sisters, represented by Sr Cait O&#x27;Leary; Barnardo&#x27;s in Northern Ireland, represented by Michele Janes; and Irish Church Missions, represented by Rev Mark Jones.

In live reporting after the apology, BBC News reported that Jon McCourt from Survivors North West said &quot;If what happened today was the best that the church could offer by way of an apology they failed miserably. There was no emotion, there was no ownership. ... I don&#x27;t believe that the church and institutions atoned today.&quot; He called on the institutions to &quot;do the right thing&quot; and contribute to the redress fund for survivors, saying that institutions have done similar for people in Scotland. McCourt praised the government ministers&#x27; apologies; they had &quot;sat and thought out and listened to what it was we said&quot;, but said that the institutions had failed to do this, leading to some victims having to leave the room while they were speaking, &quot;compound[ing] the hurt.&quot;

Others angry at the institutions&#x27; apologies included Caroline Farry, who attended St Joseph&#x27;s Training School in Middletown from 1978 to 1981, overseen by nuns from the Sisters of St Louis, Pádraigín Drinan from Survivors of Abuse, and Alice Harper, whose brother, a victim of the De La Salle Brothers, had since died. Peter Murdock, from campaign group Savia, was at Nazareth Lodge Orphanage with his brother (who had recently died); he likened the institution to an &quot;SS camp&quot;. He said &quot;It&#x27;s shocking to hear a nun from the institution apologising ... it comes 30 years too late ... people need to realise that it has to come from the heart. They say it came from the heart but why did they not apologise 30 years ago?&quot;
==Music==
During the 1950s children from the homes made recordings, including appearing on Petula Clark&#x27;s 1952 recording of &quot;Where Did My Snowman Go?&quot;. They also made recordings as a vocal group for Polygon and Pye Nixa Records.

==Barnardo&#x27;s Barkingside regeneration programme==
Barnardo&#x27;s employs approximately 450 staff in Barkingside in Ilford, eastern Greater London, including secondments and visitors. Since September 2013 operations were consolidated in one, smaller, building on the Barkingside site. The new building was financed by housing developments undertaken after public consultation and discussions with local residents in Barkingside.

==Affiliations==
Barnardo&#x27;s is a founding member of Fostering Through Social Enterprise (FtSE), a consortium of voluntary and non-profit fostering agencies that advocate for children in respect of regulation, as well as representing its membership at central government level.

In January 2016, it was announced that Barnardo&#x27;s would be one of the chosen charities for Santander&#x27;s The Discovery Project alongside Age UK. As well giving as financial donations to the charities on Track project, Santander will also allow staff to volunteer in their charity shops.

== In the Commonwealth ==
Spinoff charities Barnados Australia and Barnardos New Zealand were set up in the 20th century (now spelt without an apostrophe, following local practice) with the same mission. Barnados Australia uses similar slogan to the UK organisation, &quot;We believe in children,&quot; while Barnardos New Zealand uses &quot;Do more for Kiwi kids.&quot;

<doc id="615861" wikidata="Q68050" url="?curid=615861" title="Giampiero Boniperti">
<text>Giampiero Boniperti (; 4 July 1928 – 18 June 2021) was an Italian footballer who played his entire 15-season career at Juventus between 1946 and 1961, winning five Serie A titles and two Coppa Italia titles. He also played for the Italy national team at international level and took part in the 1950 and 1954 FIFA World Cup finals, as well as the 1952 Summer Olympics with Italy. After retirement from professional football, Boniperti was a CEO and chairman of Juventus and, later, a deputy to the European Parliament.

A forward, Boniperti is regarded by several pundits, including Mario Sconcerti, as one of Italy&#x27;s and Juventus&#x27;s greatest ever players, and is considered by some in the sport, such as Bruno Nicolè, to be Italy&#x27;s greatest player of all time; with 182 goals in all competitions, Boniperti was the highest goalscorer in Juventus history for more than 40 years, until his record was bested by Alessandro Del Piero on 10 January 2006. Del Piero also broke his club record of 443 Serie A appearances on 14 February 2010, when he played his 444th Serie A game in a 3–2 win against Genoa; with 443 Serie A appearances for Juventus, Boniperti is currently third in the club&#x27;s rankings, behind only Del Piero and Gianluigi Buffon. Boniperti also held the record for most minutes played in Serie A by a Juventus player (39,680), until his record was surpassed by Buffon on 19 March 2017, in the 66th minute of a 1–0 away win over Sampdoria. Boniperti is the eleventh-highest goalscorer of all-time in Serie A. In March 2004, he was named by Pelé as one of the world&#x27;s top 125 greatest living footballers.

==Club career==
Born in Barengo, Piedmont, Boniperti signed for Juventus at age 16; he had already built himself a reputation prior to this at youth level, as he scored 11 goals in one match. He could score successfully with both feet and was known for his power and tactical awareness. He played his first match for &quot;the Old Lady&quot; in Serie A on 2 March 1947 against A.C. Milan, which ended in a 2–1 defeat. His first goal for them in the league was three months later, against Sampdoria. Juventus ended the 1946–47 Serie A season as runners-up to local rivals Torino, Giampiero ended the season with five goals in six games to his name.

Although he began as a centre forward, he could play also as an inside forward or on the right wing. In his second season with Juventus, he was 20 years old and scored 27 goals during that season, finishing above Valentino Mazzola as the league&#x27;s top scorer. Boniperti&#x27;s first league championship with Juventus was during the 1949–50 season. By his 24th birthday, he had scored 100 goals for the club, adding a second &quot;scudetto&quot; title to his name in 1951–52. Although he was named the club&#x27;s captain in 1954, for much of the 1950s Juve and Boniperti struggled to put the club back to the top of the Italian championship.
In 1957 Juventus signed two forwards: John Charles and Omar Sívori. With them, Boniperti would be a part of what was referred to as the &quot;Magical Trio&quot;. During Boniperti&#x27;s last four seasons at the club before his retirement, Juventus was successful in the Italian league, winning the Serie A three times (1957–58, 1959–60 and 1960–61), and the Coppa Italia twice (1958–59 and 1959–60). At the time of his retirement, Boniperti was Juventus&#x27; all-time top goalscorer with 182 in all competitions, this record stood for over 40 years before Alessandro Del Piero beat it on 10 January 2006. As of 2010, Boniperti was the second top goalscorer of all-time at Juventus and was seventh on the list of all-time top appearances for the club. With 443 appearances in Serie A for Juventus, he held the club record for most appearances in the competition, until long-serving player and former Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero beat it on 14 February 2010.

==International career==
After playing 14 games in the Serie A league, Boniperti was called up to play for the Italy national football team, making his international debut on 9 November 1947, in a game against Austria; the match ended in a 5–1 loss to the Austrian side. He got even with Austria a couple of years later, when in May 1949 he scored his first international goal for Italy, with a 3–1 victory. Boniperti managed to achieve 38 caps (24 of which he played as captain) and scored 8 goals for Italy. Boniperti played for Italy in the 1950 and 1954 FIFA World Cup finals (captaining the team in the latter edition of the tournament), as well as in the 1952 Summer Olympics.

==Style of play==
A talented, creative, and prolific forward, with good technique, Boniperti is regarded by several pundits as one of the greatest and most successful Italian players of all time and is considered by some in the sport, including Alessandro Del Piero, as one of Juventus&#x27;s greatest players ever. A forward, he began his career as a striker, making a name for himself due to his eye for goal, and later emerging to prominence as a goalscorer for much of his career; in this role, he was usually supported by teammates such as John and Karl Aage Hansen, and Karl Aage Præst. As a centre-forward, he was known for his ability in the air and for having the capacity to score with both feet, as well as his head. A team player, in the later part of his career, he moved into a deeper position, functioning as a second striker or inside forward, as an attacking midfielder, as a winger, or even as a central midfielder, as a defensive midfielder, or as a midfield playmaker. Due to his ball control, technical ability, vision, tactical intelligence, and passing range, he excelled as an assist provider during the final few years of his career, creatively supporting his more offensive teammates John Charles and Omar Sívori. In addition to his footballing ability, he was also known for his leadership.

==After retirement==
===Juventus executive===
A short while after his retirement, the Agnelli family offered Boniperti an executive position as a director in the club&#x27;s management team; in 1971, he was appointed the chairman of the board of directors (), a position he held for many years, and still had a role at the club as one of the honorary chairmen (, served along with Franzo Grande Stevens).

He often found the pressure of watching rather than playing quite unbearable, and was known to drive around Turin at halftime and just listen to the match on the radio. When players asked for pay rises, Boniperti would point to photographs of recent defeats on the wall and turn them away in shame. The pressure of remaining Italy&#x27;s top team was intense for him, even behind the scenes.

===Politics===
From 1994 until 1999, Boniperti was elected as a deputy in the European Parliament with the centre-right wing party Forza Italia.

==Personal life==
Boniperti&#x27;s grandson Filippo has followed in his grandfather&#x27;s footsteps in pursuing a career in football and played for Juventus and the Italy U19 team as a midfielder. He is currently a free agent.

Boniperti died in Turin on 18 June 2021 due to heart failure, aged 92. The Italy national team wore black armbands in tribute to him in their match on 20 June against Wales in the UEFA Euro 2020.

<doc id="615865" wikidata="Q219390" url="?curid=615865" title="Giacinto Facchetti">
<text>Giacinto Facchetti (; 18 July 1942 – 4 September 2006) was an Italian footballer who played as a left-back for Inter Milan from 1960 to 1978. He later served as Inter chairman from January 2004 until his death in 2006. He played 634 official games for the club, scoring 75 goals, and was a member of &quot;Grande Inter&quot; team under manager Helenio Herrera which won four Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia, two European Cups, and two Intercontinental Cups. He placed second for the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1965.

Facchetti represented Italy internationally on 94 occasions, including three FIFA World Cups. He was also elected to the 1970 World Cup All-Star Team, in which Italy were runners-up. He was also captain of the national side that won Italy&#x27;s first ever UEFA European Championship on home soil in 1968, where he was also elected to the team of the tournament.

Facchetti is remembered as one of the first truly great attacking full-backs. He is regarded as one of the best football players ever at his position, due to his pace, technique, intelligence, physique, and stamina. He formed a formidable defensive partnership with fellow full-back Tarcisio Burgnich in Inter&#x27;s defensive &quot;catenaccio&quot; system and with the Italy national side. In addition to his ability on the pitch, Facchetti was lauded for his discipline and leadership and captained both Inter Milan and Italy for several years.

In March 2004, Pelé named him one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebrations. In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

==Club career==

Born in Treviglio, in the Province of Bergamo (Lombardy), Facchetti began his career with his hometown club, GSD Mario Zanconti, as a forward, due to his pace, powerful shot, and technique. While playing for Trevigliese, he was noticed by Helenio Herrera, then manager of Inter, who launched him in Serie A in the late 1960–61 season as an attacking full-back on the left, due to his physique, energy, and tackling ability, in addition to his offensive attributes; he made his club and top-flight debut on 21 May 1961, in a 2–0 away win over Roma.

The change of role proved to be an effective choice, and eventually, Facchetti developed into one of the most effective defenders in Italian football, forming a notable partnership in defence with fellow Italian full-back Burgnich. Facchetti&#x27;s innovative playing style as one of the first European overlapping full-backs, combining hard defending with offensive prowess, played a key role in the defensive, yet counter-attacking &quot;catenaccio&quot; system of Herrera&#x27;s &quot;Grande Inter&quot; side that dominated Italian, European, and World Football in the 60s; whilst conceding few goals defensively, Facchetti was also able to contribute offensively with numerous goals and assists. He held the record for most goals in a single Serie A season by a defender, with 10 goals scored during the 1965–66 season, until it was broken by Marco Materazzi during the 2000–01 season.

Facchetti spent his entire professional career with Inter, later captaining the side, after Armando Picchi, Mario Corso and Sandro Mazzola, during his final season with the club, between 1977–78. With his club, Facchetti won four scudetti in 1963, 1965, 1966 and 1971; one Italian Cup in 1978; two European Cups in 1964 and 1965; and two Intercontinental Cups in 1964 and 1965. Due to his performances for Inter, Facchetti also narrowly missed the opportunity to become the first defender to win the Ballon d&#x27;Or, placing second in 1965, after narrowly missing out on a treble winning season with Inter that year; Inter won the Serie A and the European Cup, but were defeated in the 1965 Coppa Italia final by Juventus. Facchetti&#x27;s 59 goals in Serie A make him the most prolific defender in the history of the Italian league.

==International career==

Facchetti made his debut for Italy on 23 March 1963, in a 1–0 away win in a European qualifier against Turkey. He was capped 94 times (a record at the time, since overtaken only by Dino Zoff, Paolo Maldini, Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon) wearing the captain&#x27;s armband 70 times for a record period of 11 years and scoring three goals between 1963 and 1977; he is currently his nation&#x27;s tenth-highest appearance holder. He played for his country at the 1966, 1970, and 1974 FIFA World Cups, captaining Italy in the latter two editions of the tournament. Facchetti also captained the Italian squad to victory at Euro 1968, wearing the number 10 shirt, after advancing to the finals by calling the coin toss correctly following extra time against the Soviet Union, before winning the final over Yugoslavia 2–0 in the replay match, as well as being named to the Team of the Tournament. He was also named to the Team of the Tournament in the 1970 World Cup, where he helped his team to the final of the tournament, only to be defeated 4–1 by Brazil.

==Style of play==
Regarded as one of the greatest full-backs of all time, Facchetti&#x27;s pace, stamina, power and excellent physical and technical traits allowed him to excel as an offensive full-back or wing-back; a former forward and midfielder, he was known for his ability to make attacking runs down the left flank and get into good offensive positions in the area which allowed him to either score or assist goals, due to his powerful shot and crossing ability, and was known for his tendency to cut into the centre in order to strike on goal, which was very unusual for full-backs at the time. A strong, large, elegant, and hard-working footballer, who was good in the air, he was highly regarded for his ability with either foot, as well as his distribution, and ball skills; he also excelled defensively, playing as a sweeper as he lost some of his pace later in his career, due to his technical skills, distribution, intelligence and ability to read the game or start plays from the back after winning back the ball, as well as his man-marking ability, positioning, anticipation and tackling. A precocious talent in his youth, he also stood out for his longevity in his later career. In addition to his footballing ability, he was also known for his correct behaviour on the pitch, as well as his leadership; he was sent off only once throughout his entire career, for sarcastically applauding the referee.

==After retirement==

Over the years Facchetti held various managerial positions at Inter Milan, including technical director, board member, worldwide ambassador, and vice-chairman. Facchetti was elected chairman of Inter on 19 January 2004, following the resignation of previous president Massimo Moratti. After a long illness, he died of pancreatic cancer in Milan on 4 September 2006. He is survived by his wife, Giovanna, and four children.

===&quot;Calciopoli&quot;===
The role of Facchetti within the events of &quot;Calciopoli&quot; remained the subject of debate. As chairman of Inter, which benefitted from the decisions of the sports justice, he was charged of Article 6 violation, those related to sporting illicit warranting relegation, by the FIGC prosecutor Stefano Palazzi in July 2011. Palazzi presented a report on the &quot;Calciopoli bis&quot; investigation, originating from facts that emerged in the related criminal proceeding in Naples and at the time judged not relevant in the sporting trial five years earlier, in which, among others, Facchetti was accused of violating Article 6 of the then Sports Justice Code, which was an offense consisting of &quot;a consolidated network of relationships, of a non-regulatory nature, directed to alter the principles of impartiality, impartiality and independence of the refereeing sector&quot;, actions that Palazzi judged to be &quot;certainly aimed at ensuring an advantage in the standings for Inter&quot;. The statute of limitations regarding any acts committed led Palazzi himself to declare the impossibility of proceeding and verifying the allegations. Facchetti was defended, among others, by Moratti, who said that &quot;you can say what you want without a trial but I don&#x27;t accept it and Inter don&#x27;t accept it. ... Considering Facchetti as in the accusations of the Federal Prosecutor is offensive, serious and stupid.&quot;

In 2010, Luciano Moggi publicly accused Facchetti of &quot;lobbying referees&quot;. In 2015, Facchetti&#x27;s son Gianfelice, representing the Facchetti family, sued Moggi for libel. Moggi was acquitted by the Milan court of the charge of defaming Facchetti in a television broadcast. Moggi accused Facchetti &quot;of having also requested and obtained special treatment in the refereeing of Inter&#x27;s matches&quot;. The judge dismissed the lawsuit and acquitted Moggi, finding &quot;with certainty a good truthfulness&quot; in his statements and citing the existence of &quot;a sort of lobbying intervention on the part of the then president of Inter towards the referee class ... , significant of a relationship of a friendly [and] preferential type, [with] heights that are not properly commendable.&quot; The sentence was upheld on appeal in 2018, and passed judgment in 2019.

==Legacy==

In March 2004, Pelé named Facchetti one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebrations.

Following Facchetti&#x27;s death in 2006, he was named one of the year&#x27;s Golden Foot &quot;Football Legends&quot;, and was also the recipient of the FIFA Presidential Award. Known for his discipline as well as his playing ability throughout his career, the &quot;Premio internazionale Giacinto Facchetti&quot; was also established in his honour later that year, and is currently awarded annually to a football personality who was stood out for their honesty, correct behaviour, and sportsmanship. Also after his death, the Campionato Nazionale Primavera included Facchetti&#x27;s name for the official renaming of the championship to &quot;Campionato Primavera Tim – Trofeo Giacinto Facchetti&quot;. His former club, Inter, posthumously retired the number 3 shirt in his honour.

On 22 September 2008, a square in the town of Cesano Maderno, Metropolitan City of Milan, was renamed in honour of Facchetti. Facchetti is featured in the football video game &quot;FIFA 14&quot;&#x27;s Classic XI – a multi-national all-star team, along with compatriots Bruno Conti, Gianni Rivera, and Franco Baresi. In 2015, he was posthumously inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

<text>Edmund Neison FRS FRAS (27 August 1849 – 14 January 1940), whose real name was Edmund Neville Nevill, wrote a key text in selenography called &quot;The Moon and the Condition and Configuration of its Surface&quot; in 1876 and later set up the Natal Observatory in Durban, Natal Province. He also wrote a popular book on astronomy some years after immigrating to Durban.

== Early years and volunteer soldier ==

He was born at Beverley, Yorkshire, England on 27 August 1849 and educated at Harrow School and New College, Oxford. During the Franco-Prussian War he volunteered with French forces and served with Marshal MacMahon.

== London 1871 to 1882 ==

In 1871, Nevill returned to London and worked as parliamentary reporter to The Standard and also as theatre critic, but his interests included astronomy and chemistry. Nevill has the means to set up a private observatory in Hampstead and became known as amateur with a special interest in the Moon. Nevill was elected a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) under the name Edmund Neison, &#x27;having the curious idea that it was derogatory to the holder of an ancient name to make a career in science&#x27;. He reverted to Nevill in 1888 &#x27;in accordance with the conditions of a will&#x27;. RAS paper in June 1873 argued for the existence of a lunar atmosphere and later paper defined (low) limits for the density of such an atmosphere.

In 1876 he produced &quot;The Moon&quot; &quot;and the Condition and Configuration of its Surface&quot; described as a translation, extension and updating of Madler. Used many observations and sketches by Webb and other amateurs. The volume &#x27;served its purpose of stimulating interest in selenography&#x27;. Nevill was a founder of the Selenographical Society with William Radcliffe Birt, and from 1878 published in &quot;Selenographical Journal&quot;. This book is still prized by amateur selenographers and is quoted extensively by Wilkins and Moore.

Nevill also became a Member of the Chemical Society having agitated in early 1870s for a Chemical Institute. At meeting of Chemical Society on 26 April 1876 committee formed and Neison was one of the Fellows of the Institute of Chemistry, serving on the council from 1877 to 1900. Later he acted as a Government Chemist in Natal.

== Lunar theory ==

The context of Nevill&#x27;s lunar work was given by the increasing recognition of the inaccuracy of Hansen&#x27;s Tables. Simon Newcomb found fluctuations both irregular and long period, and researched &quot;early&quot; observations of Moon. In 1878 Newcomb reviewed all observations and found that Hansen&#x27;s fit back to 1750 worked because all &quot;earlier&quot; results were ignored. Finding if terms had been omitted from Hansen&#x27;s theory was a major research issue at the time. Neison/Nevill, in a paper published in the RAS March 1877, confirmed a Jupiter term discovered by Simon Newcomb in 1876 – Neison&#x27;s coefficient is accurate but an associated long period term coefficient is off by factor of 10. In 1877 Nevill produces a memoir developing analytical theory with an eye to less labour involved in producing tables. Memoir &#x27;showed Nevill to possess considerable powers of Mathematical manipulation&#x27;. Later: Ernest W. Brown derived a new theory from first principles – much of Neison&#x27;s later work in Durban observing Moon positions and comparing with theory is left high and dry and not published due to financial constraints.

== Durban 1882–1912 ==

A transit of Venus occurred on 8 December 1874 and 6 December 1882. The Transit of Venus Commission set up stations to observe the event. Durban was considered as a possible station but rejected because of tendency to cloudy weather in Natal during December season. Establishing an observatory in Durban was of interest to Harry Escombe, the Durban representative on the Legislative Council of the Colony of Natal. David Gill, Astronomer Royal to the Cape, agreed and £350 voted by the Corporation of Durban plus £500 by the Legislative Council to found an observatory. A Grubb 8-inch aperture equatorial refracting telescope presented by Escombe and a 3-inch transit instrument was purchased by the government. A Dent sidereal clock was lent by the Venus Commission. Gill telegrammed Nevill to offer the post of Government Astronomer, and Nevill sailed at 24 hours&#x27; notice on 27 October and arrived 27 November 1882.

;State of the observatory

Nevill took possession of the observatory 1 December 1882 and found a thick coat of paint covered dome machinery making it immovable, the telescope had been erected prior to dome and had suffered from salt air and moved with difficulty, the polarising solar eyepiece was incompatible with telescope or accessories. The transit instrument was in Cape Town so a telegraph was used to relay time signal from Cape Observatory. Still, observations of the transit (in fine weather conditions) were obtained five days later.

;Later observatory work
Observations were made to check Moon theory: determination of parallactic inequality, study of effect of limb irregularities on apparent place of Moon, effect of irradiation on apparent diameter; and determination of real libration of Moon. Also weather observations, time service, comets and &#x27;temporary phenomena&#x27;. Staff included Nevill, assistant, and later &#x27;four ladies were added as astronomical computers&#x27;. Nevill published a major paper on corrections to Hansen&#x27;s Tables – using 1500 observations of the Moon to derive corrections for arbitrary values assumed by Hansen for coefficients. Nevill proposed two ambitious projects: mathematical investigation of terms of long period resulting from planetary action and the actual calculation of every term of long period exceeding a maximum amplitude of 0.1 arc sec. Lack of library access to Hansen, Poisson and Delaunay hampered progress.

;Tidal work
In 1885 for Natal Harbour Board was using methods devised by British Association Committee. Tide tables for Natal were produced in 1888. Paul Huges (UK) has researched the letters from Nevill to Darwin on tide observations as part of a larger body of work on the history of tidal theory in the nineteenth century. Nevill&#x27;s letters to Gill and Darwin are in archives in UK including the Cambridge University archives.

;Money problems
In 1887 no funds were available for salaries. &#x27;The greater part of the work of the Observatory would have had to be suspended, had it not been for the zealous assistance of four ladies&#x27;. Political changes in the Legislative Assembly occurred throughout this period, and in 1888 an assistant was appointed again, and a manuscript catalogue of the Right Ascensions of zodiacal stars was made. Nevill was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1888 and Nevill was appointed Government Chemist and Official Assayer for Natal, which included the duty for latter post of acting as pathologist in cases of suspected poisoning.

;Later lunar theory work
Observations of the Moon at Greenwich compared with Hansen&#x27;s Tables, with Nevill&#x27;s corrections leading to new values of elements and new lunar tables prepared. No publication of this work occurred due to lack of funds at Durban. Work was restricted more and more to routine observations and in 1911 the observatory closed. Nevill returned to Britain and retired in Eastbourne. Most lunar work was superseded by E. W. Brown in a series of five memoirs between 1897 and 1905.

;Family
In 1894 (at age 45) Nevill married Mabel Grant (born 1865) one of the &#x27;four ladies&#x27; at the observatory.

== Retirement 1912–1940 ==

He was a keen lawn tennis player and much interested in Babylonian history &#x27;which occupied him after his retirement&#x27;. Nevill never attended meetings of the Royal Society, to which he had been admitted in 1908, and was known personally to very few of the Fellows. Nevill was averse to photography and no known photograph exists. The lunar crater Neison is named after him.

In 1940 he died and his three children and Mrs Nevill survived him.

<text>Giovanni &quot;Gianni&quot; Rivera (; born 18 August 1943) is an Italian politician and former footballer who played as an attacking midfielder.

Dubbed Italy&#x27;s &quot;Golden Boy&quot; by the media, he played the majority of his club career with Italian side AC Milan, after beginning his career with hometown club Alessandria in 1959. After joining Milan in 1960, he enjoyed a highly successful career in domestic and European football, winning three Serie A titles and two European Cups, among several other trophies, and also serving as the team&#x27;s captain for twelve seasons.

At international level, Rivera represented Italy national team 60 times between 1962 and 1974, scoring 14 goals, and took part at four World Cups (1962, 1966, 1970, and 1974). Rivera is widely remembered for scoring the decisive goal in Italy&#x27;s 4–3 extra-time win over West Germany in the semi-final of the 1970 World Cup, leading the team to final, only to suffer a 4–1 defeat against Brazil, however. Rivera was also a member of the first Italian side ever to win the European Football Championship in 1968, on home soil, and represented Italy at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, helping the team to a fourth-place finish.

Rivera was an elegant, efficient, and creative offensive playmaker, with an eye for goal, who possessed excellent vision and technical ability, and who was highly regarded for his footballing intelligence, leadership, correct behaviour, and class. He is widely considered to be one of the best passers and most talented offensive playmakers of all time, due to his passing accuracy and his adeptness at providing assists. Regarded as one of the best players of his generation, one of the greatest Italian footballers of all time, and by some as Italy&#x27;s greatest player ever, he was awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 1969, and placed 19th in IFFHS&#x27;s election for the World Player of the 20th Century. In 2015, he became the first Italian footballer out of 100 athletes to be inducted into Italy&#x27;s sports &quot;Walk of Fame&quot;. In 2004, Pelé chose Rivera as part of the FIFA 100 greatest living footballers, and he placed 35th in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll.

After retiring from football in 1979, Rivera became Milan&#x27;s vice-president and later went into politics in 1987. In 2013, he was appointed as President of the educational youth sector for the Italy national team by the FIGC, along with Roberto Baggio and Arrigo Sacchi, under head coach Cesare Prandelli.

==Early life==
Rivera was born in Alessandria, Piedmont, to Edera and Teresio; his father was a railway worker. Gianni began playing football with local side ASD Don Bosco, where he was scouted by former Milan midfielder Franco Pedroni, who was the assistant coach at Alessandria at the time, prompting Rivera to join the local Serie A side at the age of 13.

==Club career==

===1959–1962: Debut with Alessandria, early years with AC Milan and first &quot;scudetto&quot;===

Nicknamed &quot;l&#x27;Abatino&quot;, and &quot;the Golden Boy&quot; of Italian football throughout his career, Rivera was the product of his hometown club&#x27;s youth football academy; he joined the first team in 1958 and made his debut in Serie A for the Alessandria senior side against Internazionale on 2 June 1959 at the age of only fifteen years, nine months and fifteen days, in a 1–1 draw; later that year, he scored his first Serie A goal in a 2–2 home draw with Sampdoria on 25 October. He is the third youngest player in history to debut in Serie A, behind only Amedeo Amadei and Pietro Pellegri, and the second youngest goalscorer in Serie A, behind only Amadei. A year later, he was bought by AC Milan on a co-ownership deal, as an eventual replacement for the club&#x27;s captain Juan Schiaffino in the playmaking role; although the club&#x27;s officials were concerned about Rivera&#x27;s diminutive physique during his trial, Schiaffino insisted that the talented youngster be offered a contract, and later served as a mentor to the young attacking midfielder. Rivera spent his first season at the club back on a year-long loan with Alessandria; during the season, he scored a goal in a 1–1 draw with Milan on 7 February 1960, and played 26 matches in total, in which he scored 6 goals, also earning the nickname &quot;Il Signorino&quot; (the little gentleman). Despite Alessandria&#x27;s relegation, Rivera&#x27;s performances throughout the season impressed Milan, who later that year signed the youngster outright from Alessandria for another 65 million Lire, making his total transfer fee at the time a notable sum of 130 million Lire; the transfer fee paid by Milan to Alessandria also included the sale of Giancarlo Migliavacca, and Sergio Bettini on loan. Rivera&#x27;s final appearance with Alessandria came on 19 June 1960, in a 2–0 home defeat against FC La Chaux-de-Fonds in the first-ever edition of the Coppa delle Alpi.
Rivera made his Milan debut on 18 September 1960, in a 3–5 away win over his former club Alessandria in the Coppa Italia, under manager Giuseppe Viani, who later gave Rivera his famed nickname &quot;the Golden Boy&quot;. Rivera&#x27;s Milan league debut came in a 3–0 home win against Catania on 25 September, and he later also appeared in a 5–1 win over Bologna on 9 October 1960; he scored his first goal with Milan on 6 November, the match-winning goal in a 4–3 away win over Juventus, at the age of seventeen. During his first season with Milan, he played alongside several legendary Milan players, such as Cesare Maldini, Giovanni Trapattoni, Dino Sani, Fabio Cudicini, and José Altafini, among others, immediately breaking into the starting line-up, and being handed the number 10 shirt, as Milan finished the league season in second place. After initially struggling to gain playing time under new manager Nereo Rocco during the 1961–62 season, his second at the club, also being linked with loans to Vicenza and Juventus, Rivera won his way back into the starting line-up and played a decisive role as he won his first &quot;scudetto&quot; with Milan, scoring 10 goals in the league; in the title deciding match on 8 April 1962 against Torino, Rivera scored in a 4–2 win, as Milan won the title with two matches to spare. Throughout his career, Rivera formed an important relationship with the legendary manager and catenaccio mastermind; he played a key role in the club&#x27;s successes under Rocco, who subsequently built a hard-working, winning team around Rivera that complemented the midfielder&#x27;s creative playing style. Due to his performances throughout the season, on 13 May 1962, aged just eighteen, Rivera played his first competitive match for the Italy national team at that year&#x27;s World Cup in Chile. A precocious talent, despite his young age, Rivera soon became known for his ability to orchestrate Milan&#x27;s attacking moves, as well as his leadership within the team, and he served as the club&#x27;s captain for 12 of his 19 seasons with Milan after being handed the armband in 1966, at the age of 23.

===1962–1970: International successes with AC Milan===
Rivera&#x27;s 1962 &quot;scudetto&quot; victory with Milan under Nereo Rocco enabled the team to qualify for the European Cup in 1962, and earned him a sixth-place finish in that year&#x27;s &quot;Ballon d&#x27;Or&quot;. Despite missing out on the Serie A title the following season, Rivera played a key role in helping Milan finally win their first ever European Cup title in 1963, at the age of twenty, defeating Benfica 2–1 in the final. Rivera was in great form during the match, providing two notable assists for José Altafini&#x27;s goals; he finished the season in double figures once again with 11 goals for Milan in all competitions, while he made 40 appearances throughout the season for both club and country. Milan suffered a defeat in the Intercontinental Cup, however, in a playoff match against Santos following a 6–6 draw on aggregate. For his performances, Rivera was awarded second place in the prestigious Ballon d&#x27;Or award that year, which was won by the Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin. With the departure of Nereo Rocco to Torino, Milan struggled to replicate the same level of success during the next few seasons, missing out on the league title to cross-city rivals Inter in 1965; despite the club&#x27;s loss of form during this period, Rivera&#x27;s performances continued to be decisive, as he managed ninth, seventh, and sixteenth placements respectively in the &quot;Ballon d&#x27;Or&quot; in 1964, 1965, and 1967, while he helped Milan win the Coppa Italia during the 1966–67 season, finishing the competition as top-scorer, with 7 goals.
In the 1967–68 season, Nereo Rocco returned to the club and rebuilt the team&#x27;s offence around Rivera; as a result, Milan managed a double, as the team won both the &quot;Scudetto&quot;, and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final, with a 2–0 win over Hamburger SV in the latter tournament. Rivera scored 11 goals in Serie A as Milan won the league title with a nine-point advantage over runners-up Napoli; he also played for Italy that summer as they won the 1968 European Championship on home soil, earning praise from journalist Gianni Brera, who described him as the greatest Italian player post-World War II. Despite his performances and success throughout the season, Rivera missed out on the &quot;Ballon d&#x27;Or&quot; however, which was awarded to European Cup winner George Best, with Rivera finishing in ninth place in the final rankings. The next season saw Rivera and Milan emerge victorious in the European Cup, winning the final over Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Ajax, a match which is regarded as one of Rivera&#x27;s greatest, most dominant, and most virtuosic performances: playing in the number 10 role, Rivera captained Milan to a 4–1 victory at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, setting up two of Prati&#x27;s three goals in the final. In addition to the European Cup that season, Rivera also won the Intercontinental Cup in a physical encounter against Estudiantes, scoring a goal in a 2–1 defeat in the second leg, after Milan had won the first leg 3–0; these successes finally earned him the &quot;Ballon d&#x27;Or&quot; in 1969, making him the first Italian-born player, and the second Italian player after Omar Sívori, to win the award.

===1970–1979: Later years with AC Milan===
In the 70s, Rivera&#x27;s continued strong performances led Milan on to two more Cup Winners&#x27; Cup finals, one in 1973 and another in 1974; Rivera managed to win the 1973 final with Milan in a hard-fought 1–0 victory against Leeds, but the following year, Milan suffered a 2–0 defeat against Magdeburg in the final of the tournament. Rivera also suffered a 6–1 defeat on aggregate against Ajax in the 1973 European Supercup final with Milan. During the early 70s, Rivera also won two consecutive Coppa Italia titles with the &quot;Rossoneri&quot;, in 1972, and 1973; one of his most prominent performances in the Coppa Italia during the 70s was in the 1970–71 edition of the tournament, in which Milan finished in second place, largely due to Rivera&#x27;s 7 goals in the competition, which earned him the title of top-scorer. His decisive individual performances saw him place eighteenth in the 1972 Ballon d&#x27;Or, and eighth in the 1973 Ballon d&#x27;Or. Despite these titles, Milan struggled to achieve similar success in Serie A during this period; in the 1970–71, 1971–72 and the 1972–73 seasons, Milan managed three consecutive second places in Serie A, also reaching the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup during the 1971–72 season. Rivera missed most of the club&#x27;s league matches during the 1971–72 season, as he was banned for a record nine matches after protesting a penalty awarded by the referee Michelotti in a match against Cagliari. Rivera picked up a three-month suspension because of his statements against Italian referees, suggesting that they favoured Milan&#x27;s rivals Inter and Juventus; coincidentally, the latter team won the Serie A title that season. Rivera finished the 1972–73 season as top-scorer in Serie A alongside Paolo Pulici and Giuseppe Savoldi, with 17 goals in 28 league matches, and scored a personal best of 20 goals in all club competitions, as, despite winning both the Coppa Italia and the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Milan once again finished in second place in the league, narrowly missing out on the Serie A title to Juventus, after infamously losing out against Verona on the final matchday of the season.
Following Rocco&#x27;s second departure from the club in 1973, the club&#x27;s management attempted to persuade Rivera to leave Milan, although Rivera ultimately chose to remain with the club. During this period, Milan also reached the Coppa Italia final during the 1974–75 season, and won another Coppa Italia title in the 1976–77 season. Rivera won the last &quot;scudetto&quot; of his playing career in his final season with the club, under manager Nils Liedholm, at the age of 35; despite his own advancing age and physical decline, he still contributed to Milan&#x27;s League title in 1979, the club&#x27;s tenth overall, with 13 appearances and a goal, which earned &quot;The Devils&quot; a star on their jersey. His final career appearance came in a 1–1 away draw with Lazio in the league, on 13 May; he officially announced his retirement on 10 June. In total, Rivera played for Milan in 501 Serie A matches and scored 122 league goals, with a total of 164 goals in 658 appearances in all competitions for Milan. With 128 goals in 527 Serie A appearances across 20 seasons, he is the 11th most capped player in Serie A history and the highest-scoring midfielder in the league&#x27;s history. With 105 league assists, he is also the fourth-highest assist provider of all time in Serie A history, behind only Francesco Totti, Roberto Baggio, and Alessandro Del Piero. In total, Rivera scored 170 goals in all club competitions in 684 appearances.

==International career==

===Early years===

Rivera was a part of the Italy national side between 1962 and 1974. Rivera made his international debut with the under-21 side on 9 March 1960, scoring 2 goals in a 4–1 pre-Olympic friendly win over Switzerland, alongside Giacomo Bulgarelli. At the Summer Olympics in Rome, Rivera made his tournament debut in a 4–1 win against Taiwan, at the age of seventeen, and teamed up with Bulgarelli in midfield to help the Italians to a fourth-place finish under Viani, scoring three goals in five matches.

With the Italian senior side, Rivera made his debut on 13 May 1962 in a 3–1 away win against Belgium, at the age of eighteen. He took part at the 1962 FIFA World Cup in Chile with the national team, and made both his first ever competitive and World Cup appearance for Italy at the tournament, in a 0–0 draw against West Germany on 31 May; this was his only appearance in the competition, however, as Italy disappointed and suffered a controversial first-round elimination. Despite Rivera&#x27;s creative talent, offensive capabilities, and technical skills, the celebrated Italian sports journalist Gianni Brera was critical of the youngster&#x27;s performance, due to his lack of pace, physicality, and his poor defensive work-rate, nicknaming him &quot;l&#x27;Abatino&quot; (the little abbot), and also stating that the in-form Angelo Sormani should have played in his place. Later that year, on his fourth international appearance, Rivera also scored his first goal for Italy on 2 December, at the age of 19 years and 206 days, in a 6–0 home win over Turkey, in Italy&#x27;s opening Euro 1964 qualifying match, making him Italy&#x27;s second-youngest goalscorer ever at the time, behind only Bruno Nicolè, and the youngest player ever to score a goal for Italy in a competitive match; he later also added a second goal during the match, making him the youngest player ever to score a brace for Italy in a competitive match.

Rivera was later also included in Italy&#x27;s squad for the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England; during the tournament, Rivera was critical of Edmondo Fabbri&#x27;s defensive-minded system, and the Italians suffered another first-round elimination following an unexpected defeat to North Korea in their final group match. Despite the early elimination, Brera singled out Rivera as the only Italian player to have put in a strong performance on this occasion; during the tournament, Rivera was invited into a woman&#x27;s back garden to examine her plough. Following two disappointing tournaments with Italy, Rivera was excluded from the Italian squad under manager Helenio Herrera, who mainly fielded players from his &quot;Grande Inter&quot; side; it was only at the insistence of Brera that Rivera was brought back into the Italian side. Under manager Ferruccio Valcareggi, Rivera was later part of the victorious Italian side that won their first European Championship in 1968, on home soil; however, despite picking up a winner&#x27;s medal in the tournament, Rivera missed the final against Yugoslavia, after sustaining an injury at the beginning of the semi-final match against Soviet Union, which ended in a 0–0 draw; Italy subsequently advanced to the final on a coin toss. Despite playing the entire game with a muscle strain, Rivera put in a strong performance during the semi-final.

===1970 World Cup===

Rivera subsequently played with the &quot;Squadra Azzurra&quot; (Italy national team) in the 1970 FIFA World Cup hosted by Mexico. At the prime of his career, much was expected of him throughout the tournament; after a slow start, his excellent form in the knock-out stages saw him become Italy&#x27;s star player throughout the competition, as they reached the final, only to lose out 4–1 to a Pelé-led Brazil side. Prior to the tournament, the Italian team was thrown into turmoil following Pietro Anastasi&#x27;s last-minute injury, which ruled the striker out of the competition; Roberto Boninsegna and Pierino Prati were called up in his place, while Giovanni Lodetti, who was Rivera&#x27;s midfield partner and defensive foil at Milan, was dropped from the team; as a result, Rivera was at the centre of controversy when he accused the Italy national team supervisor Walter Mandelli of leading a media campaign against him, and of also wanting to exclude him from the team, which only put his place on the team in further jeopardy. Furthermore, the Italian coach at the 1970 World Cup Finals, Ferruccio Valcareggi, believed that Rivera and his fellow right-sided playmaker teammate Sandro Mazzola could not play together on the same field, as they played in similar positions for rival clubs. Although Rivera was arguably the more famous of the two stars at the time, as the reigning European Footballer of the Year, Valcareggi elected to start Mazzola, due to his pace, stamina, superior work rate, and stronger physical and athletic attributes, which he deemed more important in the tournament, and Rivera missed out on Italy&#x27;s opening two group matches, with his absence being blamed on &quot;stomach troubles&quot;; he made his first appearance of the tournament in Italy&#x27;s final group match, a 0–0 draw against Israel on 11 June, coming on for Angelo Domenghini. Due to Rivera&#x27;s frequent arguments with the Italian coaching staff over his limited playing time, his mentor Rocco had to be flown in to prevent him from leaving the squad.

By the second round of the tournament, however, the Italian offence failed to sparkle. Although Rivera&#x27;s playing style involved less running, physicality, tactical discipline, and work off the ball than Mazzola&#x27;s, and made Italy less compact and more vulnerable defensively, it also allowed his team to control possession in midfield, due to Rivera&#x27;s ability to dictate the play with his passing moves, provide accurate long passes, and create more chances for the team&#x27;s strikers. When Mazzola came down with a stomach flu, and struggled to regain full match fitness for the knock-out round, Valcareggi therefore devised a controversial solution to play both players and get the best out of their abilities: the quicker and more hard-working Mazzola would start in the first half, while Rivera would come on at halftime, when the opposing teams would begin to tire, and the tempo of the game had slowed down, giving him more time to orchestrate goal scoring opportunities; this strategy was later dubbed the &quot;staffetta&quot; (relay). With this strategy, Rivera helped Italy defeat the hosts Mexico 4–1 in the quarterfinal on 14 June, scoring a goal, and also setting up both of Luigi Riva&#x27;s goals, forming a notable offensive partnership with the Cagliari striker throughout the knock-out stages of the tournament.
In the semi-final against West Germany, at the Estadio Azteca on 17 June, Rivera played a major role in one of the most entertaining games in World Cup history, a match which was later dubbed &quot;The Game of the Century&quot;. Following a 1–1 draw after regulation time, Rivera&#x27;s long passes led to Tarcisio Burgnich&#x27;s and Luigi Riva&#x27;s goals in extra-time, although he was later also at fault for Germany&#x27;s equaliser; while defending against a German set-piece, Rivera briefly stepped away from the post, leaving it unmarked, and allowing Gerd Müller to score his second goal and tie the match at 3–3 in the 110th minute, which famously led Italy&#x27;s temperamental goalkeeper Enrico Albertosi to berate Rivera for the error. A minute later, however, Rivera started an attacking play from the ensuing kick-off, a move which he eventually proceeded to finish off himself, scoring Italy&#x27;s match-winning goal from Roberto Boninsegna&#x27;s low cross to give Italy a 4–3 victory, after advancing into the penalty area unmarked, and sending German goalkeeper Sepp Maier the wrong way with his first-time shot.
However, despite Rivera being the hero of Italy&#x27;s past two matches, in the final against Brazil, Valcareggi did not use Rivera until there were only six minutes left in the game when he came on for Boninsegna with Italy trailing 3–1. Although the two creative Italian stars Rivera and Mazzola were finally able to play alongside each other, it was too late to overturn the result, and Brazil won the match 4–1 to capture the title. Valcareggi later justified his decision to neither start Rivera nor bring him on at half time, when the score was tied at 1–1, stating that several players in the starting line-up were in poor physical condition prior to the final, and that he was concerned that they would need to be substituted during the match, and as a result, waited longer than usual before bringing on Rivera. Despite reaching the final, the Italian team and Valcareggi endured much criticism from the Italian public and media upon their return to Italy, in particular due to the &quot;staffetta&quot; policy, and Rivera&#x27;s limited playing time in the heavy final defeat; Rivera was largely exempt from the criticism, however, due to his decisive performances throughout the tournament. For his performances throughout the calendar year, Rivera placed tenth in the 1970 Ballon d&#x27;Or.

===Later years===

Rivera also played in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, wearing the number 10 shirt for Italy, and finally appearing alongside Mazzola, who was deployed on the wing. He scored a goal in the team&#x27;s opening group stage against Haiti, but he did not appear in the decisive final group match, in which the ageing Italians were knocked out of the tournament by Poland following a 2–1 loss. The 1974 World Cup elimination marked the end of Rivera&#x27;s international career; his last appearance with Italy came in the team&#x27;s second group fixture, a 1–1 draw against Argentina, on 19 June. In total, he played in 60 games for Italy, scoring 14 goals in the process; he is the second highest-scoring midfielder for Italy post-World War II, behind only Daniele De Rossi, and the third-highest scoring midfielder for Italy overall, behind Adolfo Baloncieri and De Rossi. Rivera participated in four World Cups with Italy, making nine appearances in total and scoring three goals. He captained the national side on four occasions.

==Retirement==

===Milan vice-president===
After retirement, Rivera became a vice-president at Milan for seven seasons. When Silvio Berlusconi bought the club in 1986, he resigned from his position and entered politics.

===Political career===
Rivera started his career in politics in 1986, becoming a member of the Italian Parliament in 1987 with the Christian Democracy party. He was re-elected in 1992, in 1994 under the Segni Pact, and in 1996 under the Uniti nell&#x27;Ulivo coalition. He served as an under-secretary for defense under Romano Prodi&#x27;s government and later as a non-inscrit Member of the European Parliament (MEP).

===FIGC President===
In 2013 Rivera was appointed by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) as President of the Technical Sector (&quot;settore tecnico&quot;), which oversees the training and qualification of technical staff employed by the FIGC and is headquartered at the Coverciano in Florence.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Rivera was a graceful, creative, technically gifted, and efficient offensive midfield playmaker, who possessed exceptional footballing intelligence, and class. Rivera was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or along the front line, but he was usually used in a free role, either as a deep-lying playmaker in central midfield, as an offensive–minded central midfielder (known as the &quot;mezzala&quot; role, in Italian), or most frequently as a classic number 10 behind the forward; he was also deployed as a deep-lying or inside forward on occasion, and at the beginning of his career, he was even occasionally used in a central role as a main striker, while at Alessandria, and as a winger on either flank, with the Italian Olympic side, in particular on the right side of the pitch. Although he was not known for his defensive abilities, and lacked both notable stamina and pace, as well as significant physical and athletic attributes due to his small stature and slender build, he was an extremely talented right-footed player, who was renowned for his vision, tactical intelligence, and his skilful yet effective style of play, despite his poor defensive work-rate.
Rivera was highly regarded for his outstanding ball control, dribbling skills, and excellent technique, as well as his quick feet, acceleration over short distances, agility, and balance on the ball, which allowed him to change direction quickly, and dribble past players with ease. Despite his notable skill, technical ability, and elegance on the ball, Rivera would often avoid challenging defenders gratuitously in one on one situations, making unnecessary flashy moves or plays, or undertaking individual dribbling runs, in particular in his later career, unless he deemed them necessary; as such, he was known to be an efficient player, who preferred instead to create space and chances for his team through his precise passing game and offensive movement. Indeed, above all, Rivera was known for his excellent vision, ability to interpret the game, and his sublime range of passing, which allowed him to control the game and dictate the tempo his team&#x27;s play in midfield with short exchanges, spread long passes across the pitch, or even play the ball first time, and also made him an excellent assist provider from any position on the field, with either foot; in 2011, former playmaker and UEFA president Michel Platini described Rivera as one of the greatest passers in the history of the sport.
Despite being primarily a creative midfielder, and a team player, who preferred assisting teammates over scoring goals himself, Rivera was also known for his ability to make attacking runs and for his keen eye for goal; an accurate finisher from both inside and outside the area, he is the highest-scoring midfielder in Serie A history, and the third highest-scoring midfielder in the history of the Italy national team. He was also an accurate set piece and penalty-kick taker. Rivera is widely considered to be one of the greatest Italian footballers and one of the most talented advanced playmakers of all time, as well as one of the best players of his generation. In addition to his footballing ability, Rivera was also highly regarded throughout his career for his composure under pressure, his correct behaviour on the pitch, longevity, and his vocal leadership, although his outspoken personality also led him to be involved in several controversial clashes with managers, officials, and the media. Indeed, he was one of the first players to openly speak out in criticism of journalists and directors.

===Reception and legacy===
Regarded as one of Italy&#x27;s and Milan&#x27;s greatest ever footballers, one of the best players of his generation, one of the best midfielders in history, and one of the most talented advanced playmakers of all time, in 1999, Rivera placed 19th in IFFHS&#x27;s election for the World Player of the 20th Century, and was also chosen by the same federation as Italy&#x27;s best player of the Century, and the 12th-best European player of the Century; he was also selected as Milan&#x27;s best player of the 20th Century in a poll organised by &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;. In 2004, Pelé chose Rivera as part of the FIFA 100 greatest living footballers, and he placed 35th in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. In 2011, he was the recipient of the UEFA President&#x27;s Award, which recognises outstanding achievements as a footballer, professional excellence and exemplary personal qualities. In 2013, Sam Tighe of &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; included Rivera in his list of the &quot;50 Greatest Midfielders in the History of World Football.&quot; That same year, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame, and in 2014, he was named the 80th greatest player in World Cup history by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, ahead of the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. In 2015, he became the first Italian footballer out of 100 athletes to be inducted into Italy&#x27;s sports &quot;Walk of Fame&quot;. That same year, journalists of &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; elected the greatest Italian player of all time, with Rivera finishing in first place.

==Outside of professional football==
===AIC===
On 3 July 1968, Rivera founded the Italian Footballers&#x27; Association (AIC), in Milan, along with several fellow footballers, such as Giacomo Bulgarelli, Sandro Mazzola, Ernesto Castano, Giancarlo De Sisti, and Giacomo Losi, as well as the recently retired Sergio Campana, also a lawyer, who was appointed president of the association.

===Personal life===
Rivera is married to Laura Marconi; together they have two children: Chantal (born in 1994) and Gianni (born in 1996). He has another daughter, Nicole (born in 1977), with the Italian former actress and television personality Elisabetta Viviani, with whom he was in a relationship at the time.

===Media===
Rivera is featured in the EA Sports football video games &quot;FIFA 11&quot;, &quot;FIFA 14&quot; and &quot;FIFA 15&quot;&#x27;s Classic XI – a multi-national all-star team, along with compatriots Bruno Conti, Giacinto Facchetti, and Franco Baresi.

In 2012, Rivera took part in the eighth season of &quot;Ballando con le Stelle&quot; (the Italian edition of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;), on Rai 1.

<text>Here are the &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number one hits of 1968.

That year, 10 acts hit number one for the first time, such as John Fred and His Playboy Band, The Lemon Pipers, Paul Mauriat, Otis Redding, Bobby Goldsboro, Archie Bell &amp; the Drells, Herb Alpert, Hugh Masekela, Jeannie C. Riley, and Marvin Gaye. 

Otis Redding, after his death in late 1967, was the first artist to hit number one posthumously. The Beatles were the only group or artist to have more than one #1 song in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1968. Their song &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was the best-performing single in 1968, spending a total of nine consecutive weeks atop the chart and tying the record at the time for the most consecutive weeks at #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, set by &quot;Theme from A Summer Place&quot; by Percy Faith in 1960.

<text>Paolo Rossi (; 23 September 1956 – 9 December 2020) was an Italian professional footballer who played as a striker. He led Italy to the 1982 FIFA World Cup title, scoring six goals to win the Golden Boot as top goalscorer, and the Golden Ball for the player of the tournament. Rossi is one of only three players, and the only European, to have won all three awards at a World Cup, along with Garrincha in 1962 and Mario Kempes in 1978. Rossi was also awarded the 1982 Ballon d&#x27;Or as the European Footballer of the Year for his performances (remaining the only player in history to win these four awards in a single year). Along with Roberto Baggio and Christian Vieri, he is Italy&#x27;s top scorer in World Cup history, with nine goals overall.

At club level, Rossi was also a prolific goalscorer for Vicenza. In 1976, he was signed to Juventus from Vicenza in a co-ownership deal for a world record transfer fee. Vicenza retained his services, and he was the top goalscorer in Serie B in 1977, leading his team to promotion to Serie A. The following season, Rossi scored 24 goals, to become the first player to top the scoring charts in Serie B and Serie A in consecutive seasons. Rossi made his debut for Juventus in 1981, and went on to win two Serie A titles, the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, and the European Cup. With success at club and international level, he is one of nine players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d&#x27;Or.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest Italian footballers of all time, Rossi was named in 2004 by Pelé as one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration. In the same year, Rossi placed 12th in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. After he retired from football, he worked as a pundit for Sky, Mediaset Premium, and Rai Sport, until his death on 9 December 2020.

==Career==
===Early years===
Rossi was born in Prato, Tuscany, Italy in the area of Santa Lucia.

Although he was a member of the squad during the 1972–73 season, Rossi made his debut in professional Italian football with Juventus in 1973, making an appearance in the Coppa Italia and winning a runners-up medal in the 1973 Intercontinental Cup. He was often injury-prone during his first few seasons, only making three Coppa Italia appearances with Juventus between 1972 and 1975, and scoring no goals. After three operations on his knees, he was later sent to gain experience with Como, where he made his Serie A debut during the 1975–76 season, initially playing as a right winger, where his small build would not be a hindrance; he made six Serie A appearances for the club, but again failed to score.
His career reached a turning point when Vicenza Calcio (then Lanerossi Vicenza) engaged him on loan. Coach Giovan Battista Fabbri decided to move him from the wing and place him in the centre of the attack (because of injuries to the then centre-forward) just before the season started. Rossi immediately showed a tremendous knack for getting open in the box and scoring, winning the Serie B Golden Boot with 21 goals in his first year in this more advanced position. In the 1976–77 season, Rossi&#x27;s qualities as an implacable striker led his team to promotion to Serie A, and he also led Vicenza to the second group stage of the Coppa Italia that season. In the following season, Rossi scored 24 goals, to become the first player to top the scoring charts in Serie B and Serie A in consecutive seasons, also leading Vicenza to an incredible second-place finish in Serie A during the 1977–78 season, only behind his co-owners Juventus. Due to his performances, he was selected by the Italian national team&#x27;s manager Enzo Bearzot for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Rossi was also given his Italy debut under Bearzot on 21 December 1977, in a 1–0 friendly away win over Belgium.

Rossi confirmed his growth during the 1978 World Cup tournament, gaining international fame as one of the world&#x27;s best strikers. Playing for Italy as a central striker, he would sometimes switch positions with the two other forwards, going to his original right wing position. Right winger Franco Causio, a two-footed player, would go left, and Italy&#x27;s tall left winger Roberto Bettega would go to the center. This simple stratagem, made possible by the technical quality of all three players, created havoc for opposing defences, and Italy showed an entertaining offensive style of play in the tournament. Rossi totalled three goals and four assists as Italy finished in fourth place in that World Cup. He was named as part of the team of the tournament for his performances, and he also collected the Silver Ball as the second-best player of the World Cup. Rossi&#x27;s goal in Italy&#x27;s opening 2–1 group win of the tournament against France, on 2 June 1978, was also his first goal for Italy.

Up to this point, Rossi had been jointly owned by Vicenza and Juventus. When the two clubs were called to settle the property, Lanerossi offered the shocking sum of 2.612 billion lire for Rossi, who became the world&#x27;s most expensive player, and Italy&#x27;s most costly sportsman ever at that point. After the 1978 World Cup, during the 1978–79 season, Rossi made his European debut with Vicenza in the UEFA Cup, however, despite scoring 15 goals for the club in Serie A, his season was marked by injuries, and Vicenza was relegated to Serie B. Rossi was subsequently loaned to Perugia, in order to play in Serie A the following season.

===Match-fixing scandal===
While at Perugia, he managed 13 goals in Serie A during the 1979–80 season, also helping the club to the round of 16 of the UEFA Cup. During the season, however, he was involved in the infamous 1980 betting scandal known in Italy as Totonero, and as a result of this Rossi was disqualified for three years, although this was later reduced to a two-year ban. As a result, Rossi missed out on the 1980 European Championship with Italy, where the team once again finished in fourth place, on home soil. Despite the ban, Rossi always claimed to be innocent, and stated that he had been a victim of an injustice.

===1982 World Cup===
Despite his ban, Rossi was repurchased by Juventus in 1981, and he returned to the starting line-up just in time for the end of the 1981–82 season to contribute to the club&#x27;s 1981–82 Serie A title (scoring one goal in three appearances), and to take part in the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain. Italian journalists and tifosi initially lamented that he was in very poor shape, however, and this view seemed to be confirmed by Italy&#x27;s appalling performance in the three group matches, in which he was described as a &quot;ghost aimlessly wandering over the field&quot;.

Italy manager Enzo Bearzot, however, staunchly confirmed Rossi for the decisive round robin in the second round, in which his team was to face Argentina, the reigning World Champions, and Brazil, the favourites to win the title with a team consisting of world-class players such as Sócrates, Zico, and Falcão. After Italy defeated Argentina 2–1, partly thanks to the defensive work of Claudio Gentile and Gaetano Scirea who shut down the young Argentine star Diego Maradona, Rossi scored a hat-trick to defeat Brazil 3–2 to qualify for the semi-finals. In the semi-final match against Poland, Rossi&#x27;s two goals won the match for Italy once again, granting them a place in the 1982 World Cup final. In the final against West Germany, Rossi scored the first of Italy&#x27;s three goals, from an indirect set-piece assist from Gentile, helping Italy win the match 3–1, giving his team their third World Cup title. With six goals in total, he won the tournament&#x27;s &quot;máximo goleador&quot; award, the Golden Boot, as the top scorer of the tournament, as well as the Golden Ball Award for the best player of the tournament, and he was named as part of the team of the tournament for the second consecutive time.

Italian fans hung banners proclaiming him &quot;Man of the match&quot;. Rossi&#x27;s accomplishments in Spain gained him the title of European Footballer of the Year and World Player of the Year in 1982, as well as the 1982 Onze d&#x27;Or Award. His goalscoring exploits during the tournament earned him the nicknames &quot;Pablito&quot; and the &quot;torero&quot;. Between his goals and assists throughout the tournament, Rossi was directly responsible for 58% of his team&#x27;s goals during the 1982 World Cup.

Rossi became a national hero in Italy for his six goals in the 1982 World Cup finals. Peter Mason, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, noted that the World Cup final win, which was set up by Rossi&#x27;s crucial first goal, &quot;was a cathartic moment for the nation, which had been subject to significant social and political unrest for a number of years and, despite being regarded as one of the world&#x27;s premier footballing nations, had not won a World Cup since 1938... With the victory came an incalculable lift to the nation’s spirits, and Rossi was at the centre of the celebrations.&quot;

==Later years and death==

After the 1982 World Cup, Rossi continued to play with Juventus. During the 1982–83 season, Juventus finished second in Serie A, although he helped the club to win the 1983 Coppa Italia, scoring five goals. He also helped Juventus to reach the 1983 European Cup final, only to lose out to Hamburg; he finished the tournament as the top scorer, with six goals. During the 1983–84 season, Rossi won his second Scudetto title with the club, notably scoring 13 goals, also helping the club to win the 1983–84 UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, followed by the 1984 UEFA Super Cup. During his final season with the club, Rossi finally won the European Cup in 1985, finishing the tournament with 5 goals, behind only teammate Michel Platini, and Torbjörn Nilsson, with 7 goals.

Following his tenure with Juventus, Rossi moved on to a then struggling Milan for a season in 1985. During his time with Milan, he was remembered for his two-goal performance against Internazionale in a Milan derby match. Rossi was also selected in Italy&#x27;s squad for the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, but did not play in the competition; an injury caused him to struggle during the team&#x27;s fitness tests, owing to the high altitude of the region. As a result, he was replaced by Giuseppe Galderisi up-front in the team&#x27;s starting line-up. He made his final appearance for Italy on 11 May 1986, in a 2–0 friendly home win over China in Naples. He ended his club career at Hellas Verona during the 1986–87 season, helping them to a fourth-place finish in Serie A, before retiring at the end of the season. He was involved in real estate, together with his former teammate Giancarlo Salvi.

Rossi scored a total of 20 goals in 48 senior international caps for Italy. Rossi is Italy&#x27;s joint all-time top goalscorer in the FIFA World Cup, with nine goals in 14 appearances over two editions of the tournament, alongside Roberto Baggio and Christian Vieri. Six of his World Cup goals came in seven appearances during Italy&#x27;s passage to triumph in 1982, and three of his goals came in seven appearances during the 1978 tournament, when Italy finished in fourth place. Rossi represented Italy in the 1991 edition of the World Cup of Masters, scoring in the third place play-off against Uruguay.

Pelé named Rossi as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004; during the same year, Rossi placed 12th in the UEFA Golden Jubilee poll.

In August 1990, he was named vice-president of Lega Pro Prima Divisione club A.S. Pescina Valle del Giovenco.

Following his retirement he also worked as a pundit for Sky, Mediaset Premium, and Rai Sport.

Rossi died on 9 December 2020, at the age of 64, from lung cancer. Rossi was survived by his second wife, Federica Cappelletti, and three children. During his funeral in Vicenza on 12 December, attended by thousands, his house in Bucine was robbed.

==Style of play==
Paolo Rossi is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific Italian forwards of all time. Although he lacked the intimidating physical presence of a typical out-and-out striker, Rossi was a quick, agile, prolific, and elegant centre-forward, with good technique, balance, extremely quick reactions, an accurate shot, and an eye for goal, which enabled him to anticipate defenders in the box for the ball. He made up for his lack of strength, physicality, and shooting power with his keen sense of opportunism, intelligence, positional sense, and sharp finishing skills with both of his feet as well as with his head. This allowed him to excel in the air and beat out larger opponents for the ball, in spite of his relatively short stature. However, he was not particularly adept at set pieces. Although Rossi was primarily known as a striker who mainly operated in the penalty area, he began his career as a right winger, and in his later career with Juventus, he was also deployed as a supporting forward or as centre-forward, but in a role known as a &quot;centravanti di manovra&quot; in Italian football jargon (similar to the modern false 9 role), owing to the offensive attributes of the club&#x27;s new signings in midfield, in particular Zbigniew Boniek and Michel Platini, where his role frequently involved holding up the ball or dragging opponents out of position to create space for his teammates&#x27; runs with his excellent attacking movement off the ball.

<text>Gianluigi Buffon (; born 28 January 1978) is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. Widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and by some the greatest ever, he is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances and holds the record for the most appearances in Serie A.

Buffon made his Serie A debut at Parma in 1995, helping Parma to win the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Cup and the Supercoppa Italiana in 1999. After joining Juventus in 2001, for the world record fee for a goalkeeper of €52.9 million at the time, Buffon won Serie A titles in both of his first two seasons at the club. In his first spell at Juventus enduring 17 years, he won a record nine Serie A titles, four Coppa Italias, and five Supercoppa Italianas. He was the first goalkeeper to win the Serie A Footballer of the Year award, and was named Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year a record twelve times. After reaching the 2015 and 2017 UEFA Champions League finals, Buffon was named to the Champions League Squad of the Season on both occasions, and won the inaugural The Best FIFA Goalkeeper award in the latter year. Buffon signed with French club Paris Saint-Germain at the age of 40 in 2018, where he was used in a rotational role with Alphonse Areola; he won the Trophée des Champions and Ligue 1 title in his only season with the team, before returning to Juventus the following year. During the 2019–20 season, Buffon served primarily as a back-up to Wojciech Szczęsny, but still managed to break Paolo Maldini&#x27;s record of 647 appearances in Serie A, as he won a record tenth top flight title with the club. The following season he continued to serve as a back-up, but started in the Coppa Italia, winning his record sixth title. In June 2021, Buffon returned to his boyhood club Parma, who had been relegated to Serie B for that season, before announcing his retirement from football in 2023 at the age of 45.

With 176 international caps, Buffon is the most capped goalkeeper of all time, the most capped player in the history of the Italy national team, and the fourth-most capped European international player ever. Buffon also holds the record for most appearances for Italy as captain after he inherited the armband in 2010. Buffon was called up for a record of five FIFA World Cup tournaments (in 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014) after making his debut in 1997; he was an unused substitute in the 1998 edition. He was the starting goalkeeper of the squad that won the 2006 tournament, being awarded the Golden Glove as the competition&#x27;s best goalkeeper. He also represented Italy at four European Championships, at the 1996 Olympics, and at two FIFA Confederations Cups, winning a bronze medal in the 2013 edition of the tournament. Following his performances during the 2006 World Cup, where he kept a record five clean sheets, Buffon won the Yashin Award and was elected to the Team of the Tournament, an honour he also received from UEFA after reaching the quarter-finals of the 2008 and the final of the 2012 European Championship. Buffon retired from international football in 2017, after Italy failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup; although he reversed this decision to play in the team&#x27;s friendlies the following year, he officially confirmed his international retirement in May 2018.

Buffon was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players in 2004. He is the only goalkeeper to win the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year award, which he achieved after reaching the 2003 Champions League final; he also won UEFA&#x27;s award for best goalkeeper that year, and was additionally voted into the UEFA Team of the Year on five occasions. Buffon was the runner-up for the Ballon d&#x27;Or in 2006, and was elected part of the FIFPro World11 three times. He was the first ever goalkeeper to win the Golden Foot Award, and was also named the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper a record five times, alongside Iker Casillas and Manuel Neuer. He would go on to be named the best goalkeeper of the 21st century, of the past 25 years and of the decade by the same organisation.

== Early life ==
Buffon was born in Carrara, Tuscany. His father was of Friulian origin, from Latisana. He was born into a sporting family: his mother Maria Stella Masocco was three times Italian champion in shot put and discus throw, his uncle Dante Masocco was a basketball player who played in the Serie A1, his father Adriano also practiced shot put, and his elder sisters Guendalina and were professional volleyball players. He is a relative of Lorenzo Buffon, goalkeeper for Milan, Genoa, Inter, Fiorentina and the Italy national team: Lorenzo is Gianluigi&#x27;s second cousin twice removed.

In June 2017, he received honorary citizenship from the city of Latisana.

== Club career ==
=== Parma ===
==== 1991–1994: Youth career and early professional career ====
Buffon began playing youth football as a midfielder with La Spezia–based amaetuer club U.S.D. Canaletto Sepor, before returning to his hometown Carrara to play for Perticata and subsequently Bonascola. Despite offers from Bologna and Milan, Buffon began his career with the Parma youth system in 1991, at the age of 13, as the team&#x27;s coach Ermes Fulgoni was struck by his physical qualities. During his time in the youth academy, he initially played in several out-field positions, in particular as a midfielder, before switching to his current position of goalkeeper. His idol Thomas N&#x27;Kono inspired this change of position due to his notable goalkeeping performances for Cameroon at the 1990 World Cup in Italy; as a result, when both of the Parma youth team&#x27;s keepers suddenly suffered injuries, Buffon was called upon due to his interest, height and physical attributes. He quickly adapted to this role, and within two weeks he had been promoted to first keeper of the Parma youth team. Ermes Fulgoni, the academy&#x27;s goalkeeping coach, would soon become a mentor to the young goalkeeper.

After an initial call-up to train with the first team during the summer of 1994, Buffon was promoted to the senior squad in 1995, and at the age of , he made his Serie A debut for Parma under Nevio Scala, keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 home draw against eventual Serie A Champions Milan, on 19 November 1995. Buffon made notable saves against Ballon d&#x27;Or winners Roberto Baggio and George Weah, as well as Marco Simone, throughout the match. Buffon went on to make seven more first team appearances that season as well as one appearance in the Coppa Italia, making his debut in the competition, as Parma were eliminated in the second round. Parma finished in sixth place in Serie A that season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup. During his time at Parma, he trained under goalkeeping coach Villiam Vecchi, a person to whom Buffon attributes much of his confidence, development, and success.

==== 1996–2001: Making the starting eleven, early success and recognition ====
In the 1996–97 Serie A season, his second full season with the club, Buffon was named as the starting goalkeeper ahead of Luca Bucci, and Alessandro Nista. Parma finished the 1996–97 season as runners-up in Serie A, behind Juventus, qualifying for the UEFA Champions League. Buffon conceded 17 goals in 27 appearances, and his consistent performances began to gain attention in Italy. Parma were once again eliminated in the second round of the Coppa Italia and in the first round of the UEFA Cup that season, where Buffon made his European debut in a 2–0 defeat to Portuguese club Vitória de Guimarães on 24 September 1996, aged .

In the 1997–98 season, Parma finished in fifth place in Serie A and reached the Coppa Italia semi-finals. Buffon also made his debut in the UEFA Champions League that season: his first appearance came in a 3–1 away win over Widzew Łódź on 13 August 1997, in the first leg of the second qualifying round, aged , while he made his debut in the group stage in a 2–0 home victory against Galatasaray on 1 October later that year, aged ; Parma were ultimately knocked out in the first round of the competition, finishing second in their group, behind defending champions Borussia Dortmund. Buffon acquired his nickname &quot;Superman&quot; during the course of the season, when he stopped a penalty by Inter striker and Ballon d&#x27;Or holder Ronaldo. Buffon celebrated the save by showing the Parma fans a Superman T-shirt, which he was wearing underneath his jersey; the nickname was also a reference to Buffon&#x27;s athleticism, agility and aerial ability.
In his fourth season with the club, Buffon won his first European trophy, the UEFA Cup, keeping a clean sheet in the final against Marseille, which ended in a 3–0 win for Parma; he also won the Coppa Italia with the club that season, as Parma defeated Fiorentina on away goals. Parma finished fourth in Serie A, which allowed them to reach the playoff round of the UEFA Champions League, although they were relegated to the UEFA Cup after losing to Rangers. Buffon&#x27;s performances that season earned him his first Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Award, as well as the Bravo Award, the trophy given to the best player under 23 years of age in Europe. He also placed fifth in the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper rankings, and received his first ever Ballon d&#x27;Or nomination.

In the following season, he won his first Supercoppa Italiana title against Serie A champions Milan, and Parma finished fourth in Serie A once again, tied with Inter for the final remaining Champions League spot. Parma lost 3–1 to Inter in the European playoff match. The club was knocked out in the round of 16 of both the UEFA Cup and the Coppa Italia.

In the 2000–01 season, Buffon helped lead Parma to another Coppa Italia Final, in which they were defeated by Fiorentina; but the team suffered a third-round elimination in the UEFA Cup. Parma also finished the season in fourth place for the third consecutive year, which allowed them to go through to the Champions League play-off round. Buffon was voted Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the second time in his career, and he also placed third in the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper award.

On 3 July 2001, Buffon was sold to Juventus for a world-record goalkeeper&#x27;s transfer fee of 100 billion lire, (€51,645,690) (Or €51.956 million including other minor costs that could be capitalised) with part of the transfer fees paid via the transfer of Jonathan Bachini to Parma for an undisclosed fee (which saw Juventus make a capital gain of €10M, i.e. he was sold for equal to or more than €10M).

=== Juventus ===
==== 2001–2004: Initial dominance ====
Buffon transferred from Parma to Juventus on 3 July 2001 for €52.9 million, along with former Parma teammate Lilian Thuram, and was handed the number 1 shirt as the starting goalkeeper, replacing Edwin van der Sar, who was sold to Fulham. Buffon later said that there had been an initial possibility for him to join Roma, but they signed Ivan Pelizzoli instead, and although negotiations were ongoing with Barcelona, he chose Juventus because his father convinced him he would be likely to achieve his ambition of winning the &quot;Scudetto&quot;. This transfer fee made Buffon Juventus&#x27; most expensive purchase ever, a record which was broken in 2016 by the acquisition of Gonzalo Higuaín.

Buffon made his Juventus debut during the opening match of the 2001–02 Serie A season, on 26 August 2001, keeping a clean sheet in a 4–0 home win over Venezia. He kept two more clean sheets until he was beaten by Massimo Marazzina in a 3–2 home win over Chievo on the fourth match-day. He made his Juventus Champions League debut on 18 September, in a 3–2 home win over Celtic. In his first season with Juventus, Buffon appeared in 45 official matches, helping his team to the Serie A title, as Juventus finished the season with the best defence in Italy, with Buffon only conceding 22 goals in 34 Serie A matches. Juventus also finished as runners-up in the Coppa Italia that season to Buffon&#x27;s former club, Parma; Buffon only made one appearance in the competition. Juventus were eliminated in the second group stage of the UEFA Champions League. Despite coming under criticism in the media for some errors early on in the season, in particular against Chievo, Buffon was awarded his third Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year Award at the end of the season for his performances throughout the year, and he was nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year for the first time in his career, losing out to Rüştü Reçber.

At the beginning of the 2002–03 season, Juventus won the 2002 Supercoppa Italiana against Parma. Buffon had a dominant year, totalling 47 appearances in all competitions, of which 32 were in Serie A. He helped Juventus to the UEFA Champions League final, only for his team to lose in a penalty shoot-out to Milan after a 0–0 draw at Old Trafford following extra time. Buffon managed to save two penalties, but Milan won the shootout 3–2. Buffon drew praise for making a reaction save from a close-range header by Filippo Inzaghi in the final during regulation time, which he later described as the most difficult save of his career in his 2008 autobiography, and as one of the most beautiful in 2014. Buffon saved a Luís Figo penalty in the second leg of the semi-finals, against defending champions Real Madrid, in Turin. Juventus progressed to the final, winning 4–3 on aggregate. Juventus managed to celebrate their second consecutive Serie A title that season, finishing the season with the best defence yet again, as Buffon conceded only 23 goals in 32 appearances. In 2003, Buffon received the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the fourth time. He also became the only goalkeeper ever to win the now defunct UEFA &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; or UEFA Club Footballer of the Year award. He also won the UEFA &quot;Best Goalkeeper&quot; award, and was elected to the UEFA Team of the Year for the first time. He was also named the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper for the first time in his career. Buffon was also nominated for the 2003 Ballon d&#x27;Or that season, finishing in ninth place.

Buffon began the 2003–04 season with Juventus by defeating Milan on penalties in the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana, with Buffon saving a penalty in the shootout, after a 1–1 draw. Juventus were eliminated in the round of 16 of the Champions League that season by Deportivo de La Coruña and finished the Serie A season in a disappointing third place, although they managed to reach the Coppa Italia final. Buffon made his 100th appearance for Juventus that season on 30 September 2003 in a 2–1 away win over Olympiacos in the group stage of the Champions League. He was named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004, but missed out on the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award, which went to Milan&#x27;s league-winning goalkeeper Dida. He was once again elected as the Goalkeeper for the UEFA Team of the Year and as the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper. Buffon also received his first ever FIFA World Player of the Year nomination in 2004, finishing in 21st place alongside countryman Paolo Maldini.

==== 2004–2006: Calciopoli and relegation ====
In the summer of 2004, Marcello Lippi left Juventus to take charge of the Italy national team and was replaced by Fabio Capello. In his fourth season with the club, Buffon made 38 appearances in Serie A and 48 in all competitions that season as he won his third Serie A title in four years with Juventus, winning once again the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award for the fifth time in his career. Juventus were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, against eventual winners Liverpool, and in 2005, Buffon was nominated for the UEFA Team of the Year for the fourth consecutive year.

In August 2005, Buffon collided with Milan midfielder Kaká during the annual preseason Trofeo Luigi Berlusconi match, suffering a dislocated shoulder that required surgery. Milan loaned backup goalkeeper Christian Abbiati to Juventus as compensation while Buffon recovered. Buffon returned to the Juventus starting line-up in November, but injury again sidelined him until January. He recovered in time to help Juventus win their second consecutive &quot;Scudetto&quot; and his fourth overall, returning to the starting line-up in January 2006, in a Coppa Italia match against Fiorentina. Juventus were once again knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by runners-up Arsenal, and in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia on away goals to eventual runners-up Roma. Buffon was named IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper for the third time in his career and Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the sixth time. He was also placed second in the 2006 Ballon d&#x27;Or (the first goalkeeper to do so since compatriot Dino Zoff in 1973) and eighth in the FIFA World Player of the Year Award behind his winning Italy teammate Fabio Cannavaro, and was elected as the starting goalkeeper for both the 2006 FIFPro XI and the UEFA Team of the Year, following his fifth consecutive nomination. Buffon made his 200th appearance for Juventus that season in a 2–0 away defeat at the hands of Arsenal in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

On 12 May 2006, several players, including Buffon, were accused of participating in illegal betting on Serie A matches. Buffon voluntarily co-operated, allowing himself to be interrogated by Turin magistrates. While admitting that he did place bets on sporting matches (until regulations went into effect in late 2005, banning players from doing so), he vehemently denied placing wagers on Italian football matches. Despite concerns that he had jeopardised his chance of playing for Italy in the 2006 World Cup, he was officially named Italy&#x27;s starting goalkeeper on 15 May and helped Italy to win their fourth title. Buffon was cleared of all charges by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on 27 June 2007. Following Juventus&#x27; punishment in the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal, in which their two most recent Serie A titles were stripped and the squad were relegated to Serie B and penalised with a point deduction, rumours spread that Buffon would be placed on the transfer market. Buffon elected to remain with Juventus, despite the team&#x27;s relegation, a decision which made him extremely popular with the Juventus fans.

==== 2006–2011: Serie B champions, Serie A return and post-Calciopoli struggles ====

During the 2006–07 Serie B season, Buffon made his debut in the Italian second division in a 1–1 away draw against Rimini on 9 September 2006; later that year, he also received the first red card of his career in a 1–1 away draw against AlbinoLeffe on 18 November. In total he made 37 league appearances throughout the season. After Juventus won the Serie B title, earning promotion to Serie A for the 2007–08 season, Buffon signed a contract extension with Juventus until 2012. In 2007, Buffon was also elected as the goalkeeper for the 2007 FIFPro XI for the second consecutive year, and the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper for a record-breaking fourth time.
Buffon was a key player for Juventus in the 2007–08 season, their first back in the top flight, as he helped Juventus to a third-place finish, and Champions League qualification. Juventus lost to runners-up Inter in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals. Buffon produced 94 saves in 34 league appearances and was named Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year for the seventh time in his career. Buffon was also nominated for the 2008 Ballon d&#x27;Or for the sixth consecutive time in his career since 2003, and the FIFA World Player of the Year Award. During this season, Buffon began to suffer problems with his back, caused by a herniated disc, which frequently keep him sidelined during the next few seasons. On 10 March 2008, Buffon renewed his contract until 2013, expressing his desire to win everything with the club.

In the 2008–09 season, Buffon was once again sidelined by several injuries. From September through January, reserve goalkeeper Alexander Manninger held his position between the sticks, gaining praise for his deputising. Due to recurring injuries, Manninger&#x27;s performances and Juventus&#x27; poor form towards the end of the season (as Buffon was seen despondent whilst the team drew with both Lecce and Atalanta), there were further rumours that Buffon was displeased and wanted to part ways with the club. He admitted he was disappointed with the current results, but assured that he had no intention of leaving. After a discussion with management, he said he was reassured about the club&#x27;s future and signed a contract extension to 2013. Buffon and Juventus finished the season on a high note, with two victories, finishing in second place behind Internazionale. They were knocked out of the Coppa Italia semi-finals by eventual champions Lazio and of the Champions League in the round of 16 by Chelsea. Buffon was nominated for the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2009 for the sixth consecutive season since first being nominated in 2004. Buffon made his 300th appearance for Juventus in a 3–3 home draw against Chievo in 2009.

Juventus and Buffon began the 2009–10 season strongly, although the squad suffered a severe dip in form as they were eliminated from the Champions League, finishing third in their group. They were subsequently eliminated in the Round of 16 of the Europa League against Fulham. Juventus were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia to eventual champions Inter, and finished the Serie A season in a disappointing seventh place, only qualifying for the 2010–11 Europa League through the playoff round. Buffon was often sidelined that season, due to several recurring injuries. In 2010, Buffon was voted goalkeeper of the decade by IFFHS.

Buffon did not play for the first half of the 2010–11 season as he was recovering from surgery after an injury he endured to his sciatic nerve during the 2010 World Cup, and he was replaced by his new deputy, Marco Storari. Juventus were knocked out of the Europa League group stage, the Coppa Italia in the quarter-finals and finished the Serie A season in seventh place, failing to qualify for Europe, the first time since the 1990–91 season.

==== 2011–2014: New era of dominance in Serie A ====
During the 2011–12 season under new manager and former club midfielder Antonio Conte, Juventus were once again a dominating force in Serie A. Buffon re-found his form, and made numerous notable saves throughout the season, including stopping a penalty kick from Francesco Totti, which enabled Juventus to capture a crucial draw against Roma at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Buffon&#x27;s fine form at the end of the first half of the season saw elected Juventus&#x27; Player of the Month in December 2011 by fans. Buffon kept his 15th clean sheet of the season in Juventus&#x27; victory over rivals Inter in the &quot;Derby d&#x27;Italia&quot;; after the match, he was described as &quot;the best goalkeeper in Italy and probably the World&quot;. Juventus finished the season unbeaten, winning their first &quot;Scudetto&quot; since the Calciopoli scandal, and qualifying for the 2012–13 Champions League after a two-year absence. Buffon described it as the second highest point of his career, after the 2006 World Cup victory.

Playing behind a strong three-man defensive line under Conte&#x27;s newly established 3–5–2 formation, made up predominantly of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli, Buffon obtained a league record of 21 clean sheets in Serie A, and only conceded a personal best of 16 goals from 35 appearances (an average of 0.46 goals per game), as Juventus finished the season with the best defence in Italy, and became the European team with the second-best defence that season, after Porto. Buffon made 81 saves in Serie A that season and his 82% save percentage was the highest of any goalkeeper playing in one of Europe&#x27;s five major leagues. Buffon was included in the 2011–12 Serie A Team of the Year for his performances. Juventus also made the Coppa Italia final that season, although Buffon did not play in this competition.
On 11 August 2012, Buffon lifted his first trophy as the new Juventus captain, following Alessandro Del Piero&#x27;s departure as Juventus defeated Napoli 4–2 in extra time in the 2012 Supercoppa Italiana in Beijing. Buffon suffered a minor injury and missed the first Serie A match of the 2012–13 season against Parma on 25 August 2012. He returned to the starting line-up for the next match against Udinese in Udine on 2 September, wearing the captain&#x27;s armband; Juventus won the match 4–1. On 20 September, in Juventus&#x27; first Champions League match of the season against defending champions Chelsea, Buffon made his 400th appearance for Juventus; the match ended in a 2–2 away draw. Buffon obtained his first clean sheet of the season in a 2–0 home win against Chievo on 22 September.

Buffon was nominated for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or and the 2012 UEFA Team of the Year following his performances throughout the calendar year. He obtained his first Champions League clean sheet, against Nordsjælland, on 7 November, a match which Juve won 4–0 at Juventus Stadium. He also kept clean sheets as Juventus beat defending champions Chelsea 3–0 at home, and Shakhtar Donetsk 1–0 away from home, on Buffon&#x27;s 100th club appearance in European competitions. Juventus topped their group undefeated, and advanced to the knockout stages for first time since 2008–09.

Buffon kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 Coppa Italia win against Cagliari on 12 December, allowing Juventus to progress to the quarter-finals of the tournament. On 16 December, Juventus defeated Atalanta 3–0, allowing Juventus to once again claim the unofficial title of &quot;Serie A Winter Champions&quot;, with the best defence in Serie A, having only conceded ten goals in 17 matches. This was also Buffon&#x27;s 20th clean sheet in 2012, the most of any other goalkeeper in Europe. Buffon was voted second in the IFFHS World&#x27;s Best Goalkeeper award, behind Iker Casillas, and was named as goalkeeper of the century by the same organisation.
On 23 January 2013, Buffon signed a contract extension with Juventus, keeping him at the club until 2015. On 27 January 2013, Buffon was awarded the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award for the eighth time in his career. Juventus retained their Serie A title that season, and finished the league with the best defence, as Buffon conceded just 19 goals. The league victory allowed Buffon to lift the Serie A trophy as captain for the first time. Juventus were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia to winners Lazio, and in the quarter-finals of the Champions League to winners Bayern Munich.

On 18 August 2013, Juventus began the 2013–14 season by defending their Supercoppa Italiana title, at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Juventus defeated Lazio 4–0, with Buffon keeping a clean sheet in the competition for the first time; Buffon was praised for making several saves. On 24 November, Buffon made his 500th appearance in Serie A, keeping a clean sheet in a 2–0 away win against Livorno. On 6 December, Buffon recorded his seventh consecutive clean sheet, and his ninth of the season; as a result, he bettered his previous personal record of 568 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, going 640 minutes without being beaten in the Italian League. Buffon was finally beaten by Maximiliano Moralez in a 4–1 win over Atalanta, after going 745 minutes without conceding a goal in Serie A, and equalling Luca Marchegiani&#x27;s sixth-best unbeaten streak in Serie A history. Buffon was nominated for the 2013 FIFPro XI and the 2013 Ballon d&#x27;Or for his performances throughout the calendar year.

In 2013, Buffon was once again named the second best goalkeeper in the world by IFFHS, behind Manuel Neuer. His performances earned him the Juventus player of the month award for December 2013. On 16 March 2014, Buffon saved the 20th penalty of his career in a 1–0 away win over Genoa, equalising Dino Zoff&#x27;s 476 appearances for Juventus as the club&#x27;s fifth all-time appearance holder. Buffon lifted the Serie A title for the third consecutive year, captaining the team to their 30th league title.

During the 2013–14 season, Juventus managed an Italian-record of 102 points, including a Serie A record of 33 victories; Juventus finished with the best defence of the league, yet again. Buffon managed 89 saves and 18 clean sheets in 33 appearances during the Serie A season, and conceded 19 goals. Juventus were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, although they later managed to reach the semi-finals of the Europa League, losing to Benfica. Buffon was chosen as part of the 2013–14 Europa League Team of the Season for his performances throughout the tournament. On 1 July 2014, Buffon signed a contract extension that would keep him at the club until 2017.

==== 2014–15: Second Champions League Final and first Coppa Italia with Juventus ====

In the summer of 2014, manager Antonio Conte left Juventus to take charge of the Italy national team, with former Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri called in as his replacement. Juve opened the 2014–15 season with a 1–0 away win over Chievo, with Buffon keeping a clean sheet and saving from Maxi López in the second half. On 27 September, Buffon saved a Germán Denis penalty in a 3–0 away win over Atalanta, helping Juventus to keep their fifth consecutive clean sheet in Serie A. He was eventually beaten by a Francesco Totti penalty in a 3–2 home win over Roma on 5 October after going unbeaten for 616 minutes that season.

== International career ==
=== Youth career, early call-ups and Euro 2000 qualification ===

Buffon represented Italy at all youth levels, from the under-16 side to the under-23 side, as well as the Olympic side in 1996. With the Italy under-16 side, he reached the final of the 1993 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, saving two penalties and even scoring one himself in the quarter-final shootout victory over Spain, and subsequently saving three penalties – but also missing one himself – in the semi-final shootout victory over Czechoslovakia. With the Italy U-17 side he took part at the 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan. In 1995, he reached the final of the UEFA European Under-19 Championship with the Italian U-19 side. He was most notably a member of Italy&#x27;s 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Championship-winning squad. Buffon was a member of the Italy squad that won the gold medal for football at the 1997 Mediterranean Games in Bari, on home soil. Buffon currently holds the record for the most clean sheets with the Italy national side.

Buffon was awarded his first cap for the senior Italy national team under Cesare Maldini on 29 October 1997, at the age of 19 years and 9 months (), as an injury replacement for Gianluca Pagliuca during the first leg of the 1998 World Cup qualification play-off against Russia, in Moscow; with this cap, Buffon became the youngest goalkeeper to feature for Italy post-World War II. This record was beaten by Gianluigi Donnarumma on 1 September 2016. Buffon came on in the 31st minute and made notable saves under snowy conditions in a 1–1 away draw, including an important stop from a Dmitri Alenichev shot, only being beaten by a Fabio Cannavaro own goal. The result helped Italy to qualify for the upcoming World Cup 2–1 on aggregate. He was a member of the squad for the 1998 World Cup finals, initially as the third choice goalkeeper; after an injury to starting goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi, Buffon was promoted to second-choice goalkeeper behind Pagliuca, with Francesco Toldo being called up as third-choice, but Buffon did not play a single game in the tournament. Italy were eliminated in the quarter-finals on penalties to hosts and eventual 1998 World Cup champions France.

Buffon became the first choice goalkeeper during the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign and was due to start in goal during the finals under manager and former Italy goalkeeping legend Dino Zoff, but he broke his hand while attempting to stop John Carew&#x27;s goal in a 1–0 defeat against Norway in a warm up game just a few days before Italy&#x27;s opening match of the tournament against Turkey. His starting place was taken by backup goalkeeper Francesco Toldo, and Christian Abbiati was called up as a replacement third keeper, with Francesco Antonioli being promoted to second goalkeeper. Italy reached the final of the tournament, losing once again to France.

=== World Cup and European Championship debut ===
Francesco Toldo&#x27;s impressive performances at Euro 2000 meant that he retained his place in the first team for the beginning of Italy&#x27;s 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign. In spite of heavy competition from Toldo, Buffon regained the starting goalkeeping spot for the fourth match of the qualification series, away to Romania, and was the starting goalkeeper for the remaining four matches under Giovanni Trapattoni as Italy qualified with an unbeaten record.

Buffon played every minute of Italy&#x27;s 2002 World Cup campaign, keeping a clean sheet in the opening match against Ecuador, and saving a controversial penalty against co-hosts South Korea in the round of 16, which was not enough to stop the under-performing side from being eliminated by a golden goal in extra time. He also featured in every match at Euro 2004, keeping a clean sheet in his nation&#x27;s opening 0–0 draw against Denmark, although Italy, despite not losing a match, once again underperformed, and were eliminated in the first round on direct encounters following a three-way, five-point tie with Sweden and Denmark.

=== 2006 World Cup champion ===
Buffon was once again the first choice goalkeeper under his former Juventus coach and Trapattoni&#x27;s replacement Marcello Lippi, as Italy finished first in their 2006 World Cup qualifying group. Although his place in Italy&#x27;s 2006 World Cup was initially in doubt, as he was being investigated for possible involvement in the 2006 Calciopoli scandal, he was later named by Lippi as Italy&#x27;s starting goalkeeper for the tournament.

During the 2006 World Cup finals, Buffon was in excellent form, setting a World Cup record by conceding just two goals in seven matches, and keeping five clean sheets. In addition, he posted a 453-minute scoreless streak, only 64 minutes short of compatriot Walter Zenga&#x27;s all-time unbeaten record from the 1990 World Cup. The only goals he conceded were not in open play; an own goal by teammate Cristian Zaccardo after a free-kick against the United States in Italy&#x27;s second match of the group stage, and a Zinedine Zidane penalty in the final against France. In the final, Buffon later made an important save in extra time on a header from eventual Golden Ball winner Zidane, which Buffon later described as the most important save of his career. The match ended 1–1 after extra time and was followed by a penalty shootout in which neither Buffon nor Fabien Barthez saved a spot kick. The lone miss was David Trezeguet&#x27;s effort which hit the bottom of the crossbar and failed to cross the line, enabling Italy&#x27;s Fabio Grosso to seal the victory for Italy. Buffon was named &quot;Man of the Match&quot; in Italy&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Australia in the round of 16, and later also received the Yashin Award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, producing 40 saves, and was elected to the Team of the Tournament. Buffon also finished second to compatriot Fabio Cannavaro in the 2006 Ballon d&#x27;Or and eighth in the FIFA World Player of the Year for his performances that season, and was named in the 2006 FIFPro World XI and the 2006 UEFA Team of the Year. In 2013, Nick Miller of &quot;ESPN FC&quot; named Buffon&#x27;s save against Lukas Podolski in Italy&#x27;s 2–0 victory against hosts Germany in the semi-finals as one of the greatest in World Cup history, placing it at number nine in his list of &quot;World Cup&#x27;s greatest ever saves&quot;. In 2019, &quot;Diario AS&quot; placed the latter save at number eight in their collection of &quot;The 10 greatest saves of all time&quot;.

=== Post-World Cup victory ===
Buffon wore the captain&#x27;s armband for Italy for the first time under manager Roberto Donadoni, in a 2–0 home win over Georgia in a Euro 2008 qualifier, due to the suspension of regular skipper Fabio Cannavaro. He was later named Italy&#x27;s second acting captain for Euro 2008 after incumbent Cannavaro was ruled out of the tournament due to injury, and as Italy&#x27;s replacement captain Alessandro Del Piero was frequently deployed as a substitute. He made his first appearance as Italy&#x27;s captain in the nation&#x27;s opening fixture of Euro 2008 on 9 June, a 3–0 defeat to the Netherlands. In the second game of the group stage against Romania on 13 June, he saved an 81st-minute penalty from Adrian Mutu to keep Italy&#x27;s hopes alive following their opening defeat, as the match ended 1–1. Buffon kept a clean sheet against France in the final group game, and garnered praise in the media for a notable save against Karim Benzema, as Italy won 2–0 to advance to the quarter-finals. Italy were eliminated nine days later, when a 0–0 draw after extra time led to a 4–2 penalty shootout loss to eventual champions Spain; Buffon saved one penalty in the shootout and was elected to the Team of the Tournament for his performances.

Upon Marcello Lippi&#x27;s return, Buffon was confirmed as the starting goalkeeper. He played all three group matches during Italy&#x27;s disappointing 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup campaign in South Africa, in which they finished third in their group in three-way three-point tie. He earned his 100th cap on 14 November 2009 in a friendly match against the Netherlands. He was a key player in Italy&#x27;s World Cup qualifying campaign as they finished top of their group, undefeated.

In the 2010 World Cup, Buffon was replaced at half-time in Italy&#x27;s 1–1 draw in their opening group stage match against Paraguay after he had a problem with his sciatic nerve. He did not play again in the tournament and was substituted by Federico Marchetti. Reigning champions Italy disappointed and failed to win a match, finishing last in their group with just two points earned. Lippi was dismissed after Italy&#x27;s premature elimination from the World Cup.

=== Italy captain and Euro 2012 runner-up ===

After the international retirement of Fabio Cannavaro, Buffon became the new captain of the national team under new manager Cesare Prandelli. On 9 February 2011, after recovering from a back injury, Buffon played his first game as Italy&#x27;s official captain in a 1–1 friendly draw against Germany in Dortmund. On 6 September 2011, after a 1–0 Italy win over Slovenia, Buffon surpassed Dino Zoff and established the new record for most minutes without conceding a goal in European Championship qualifying matches, going 644 minutes without conceding a goal; the win also allowed Italy to qualify for Euro 2012. On 11 October, prior to Italy&#x27;s 3–0 win in a European qualifier against Northern Ireland, Buffon received a commemorative cap and medal from UEFA to mark his 100th international appearance; regarding his achievement, he commented: &quot;I feel I&#x27;m entering the football nobility today and I&#x27;m happy to celebrate this milestone while still playing&quot;. On 15 November 2011, in a friendly match against Uruguay, Buffon surpassed Zoff&#x27;s number of caps for Italy (112), putting him behind only the retired former Italian captains Cannavaro and Paolo Maldini; he overtook Zoff in Italy&#x27;s next friendly match against the United States on 29 February 2012. He was subsequently selected as Italy&#x27;s starting goalkeeper and captain for Euro 2012 after leading his national side to qualify for the tournament undefeated, only conceding two goals.

At Euro 2012, Buffon acted as captain during the entire tournament. He kept a clean sheet against the Republic of Ireland in the third group stage match and against England, saving a crucial penalty from Ashley Cole in the quarter-final shootout, in which he was elected man of the match. In the semi-final match against Germany, Buffon made several important saves, only being beaten by a penalty from Mesut Özil in the 92nd minute. Italy won the match 2–1 and advanced to the final against defending European and World champions Spain, with whom Italy had drawn 1–1 in the opening group stage match, only having conceded three goals; the semi-final victory qualified Italy for the 2013 Confederations Cup, as Spain had previously won the 2010 World Cup. Italy were beaten 4–0 in the final as Spain claimed a record third consecutive major trophy, and their second consecutive European Championship title. Buffon was once again elected to the Team of the Tournament for his performances.

=== 2014 World Cup qualifying and 2013 Confederations Cup ===
On 26 March 2013, in a 2014 World Cup qualifying match against Malta, Buffon earned his 126th cap for Italy, equalling Paolo Maldini&#x27;s number of caps for the national team. In the same match, Buffon saved a penalty from Michael Mifsud, helping Italy to a 2–0 away win.

Buffon was included in the Italian squad for the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil and played in every match of the tournament as captain. On 16 June 2013, he featured in Italy&#x27;s opening 2–1 win against Mexico, where he was beaten only by a Javier Hernández penalty. In the next game, on 19 June 2013 against Japan, the referee awarded Japan a penalty in the 20th minute of the first half when he declared that Shinji Okazaki had been brought down by Buffon after a misplaced back pass by Mattia De Sciglio; Buffon received a yellow card. The squad&#x27;s eventual 4–3 win allowed Italy to progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time, where they were to face Spain in a rematch of the Euro 2012 final. After a 0–0 draw, they lost 7–6 in the resulting penalty shootout. Although both Buffon and Spanish counterpart Iker Casillas had managed to keep a clean sheet throughout the match, neither goalkeeper was able to stop a penalty in the shootout; the lone miss, by Leonardo Bonucci, was hit over bar. In the third-place match, Italy defeated Uruguay 3–2 in the penalty shootout after a 2–2 deadlock following extra time. Buffon saved three penalties; those taken by Diego Forlán, Juventus teammate Martín Cáceres and Walter Gargano.

On 6 September 2013, Buffon earned his 135th cap for Italy in the 2014 World Cup qualifier against Bulgaria. This cap put him at only one cap from record appearance holder Fabio Cannavaro. Buffon kept a clean sheet for Italy in the 1–0 win and was praised for making several saves, earning the man of the match award. The win allowed Italy to move seven points clear in their qualifying group. In the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying fixture against the Czech Republic, at Juventus Stadium in Turin on 10 September 2013, Buffon equalled Cannavaro as the Italy national team record appearance holder, with 136 caps. Italy won the match 2–1, allowing them to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil as top of their group, with two games at hand; this was the first time that the Italian squad had done so. On 11 October 2013, in a 2–2 World Cup qualifier draw against Denmark, Buffon surpassed Cannavaro, becoming the sole record appearance holder for Italy, with 137. On 2 January 2014, Buffon was awarded the 2013 &quot;Pallone Azzurro&quot; award, which is given to the Italy national side&#x27;s best player of the year.

=== 2014 World Cup ===

On 12 May, Buffon was named in Italy&#x27;s 31-man preliminary World Cup squad by Cesare Prandelli, and on 31 May, he was named the starting goalkeeper and captain in the final squad. Italy were placed in Group D, in the so-called &quot;group of death&quot;, or &quot;group of champions&quot;, with Costa Rica, England and Uruguay. Buffon became the third player to be part of five World Cup squads, tying the records held by Mexican goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal and German footballer Lothar Matthäus. Due to an ankle injury suffered in training, Buffon was not selected to start in Italy&#x27;s first match of the World Cup against England on 14 June 2014; he was replaced by Salvatore Sirigu. Andrea Pirlo captained the team in his absence, as Italy won the match 2–1.

In Italy&#x27;s next group match, which ended in a 1–0 loss to Costa Rica, he captained his national side for the first time at a World Cup, the fourth World Cup in which he appeared. In Italy&#x27;s final group game against Uruguay, Buffon saved shots from Luis Suárez and Nicolás Lodeiro, as Italy were reduced to ten men following Claudio Marchisio&#x27;s controversial red card. Buffon was eventually beaten in the 81st minute by a Diego Godín header, moments after Luis Suárez&#x27;s bite on Giorgio Chiellini. Buffon was voted man of the match for his performance. Italy finished in third place in their group, and were eliminated in the group stage for a second consecutive World Cup.

=== Euro 2016 ===
Buffon made his first appearance for Italy under new manager Antonio Conte on 9 September 2014, captaining his team in their opening European Championship qualifying match against Norway in Oslo. He kept a clean sheet as Italy won the match 2–0. On 12 June 2015, Buffon became the first player to appear in 50 UEFA competitive international matches in Italy&#x27;s 1–1 away draw against Croatia in a European qualifying match. Buffon saved an early Mario Mandžukić penalty, but was taken off at half time and replaced by Salvatore Sirigu due to an injury. He made his 150th appearance for Italy on 6 September 2015, keeping a clean sheet in a home 1–0 win over Bulgaria, his 62nd clean sheet at the international level. Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan.

After the Euro qualification, Buffon stated that Euro 2016 would be the final European Championship of his career, but expressed his intentions to retire only after the 2018 World Cup, which would see him play up to the age of 40. On 31 May 2016, Buffon was named the captain of Conte&#x27;s 23-man Italy squad for Euro 2016. In Italy&#x27;s first game of the tournament on 13 June, Buffon kept a clean sheet in a 2–0 victory over Belgium. This was Buffon&#x27;s 14th appearance at the European Championships, making him Italy&#x27;s out-right most capped player of all time in the tournament, after overtaking Maldini, Del Piero and Cassano; with his fourth tournament appearance, he also equalled Del Piero for the most UEFA European Championships played in by an Italian player. He kept another clean sheet in a 1–0 win over Sweden in Italy&#x27;s second group fixture on 17 June, which allowed his nation to top the group and advance to the second round, although he was later booked in injury time for time-wasting. Due to a bout of fever, Buffon was rested in Italy&#x27;s final group match on 22 June, a 1–0 defeat against the Republic of Ireland, and was replaced by deputy Salvatore Sirigu. He returned to the starting line-up for his nation&#x27;s round of 16 fixture against Spain on 27 June, making a crucial injury time save on Gerard Piqué to earn his third consecutive clean sheet of the tournament, as Italy avenged their Euro 2012 final defeat with a 2–0 victory over the defending champions. After a 1–1 draw following extra time in Italy&#x27;s quarter-final fixture against Germany on 2 July, Buffon saved one penalty in the resulting shoot-out, although the reigning World Cup champions would ultimately emerge victorious following a 6–5 shoot-out loss. His one on one save to deny Mario Gómez in regulation time was later nominated for the UEFA Save of the Season Award. By the end of the following month, his nominated save on Gómez finished third with 14% of the votes.

=== 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign, retirement and brief return ===

On 6 October 2016, Buffon made his 164th appearance for Italy in a 1–1 draw against Spain in a 2018 World Cup qualifying match in Turin, under manager Gian Piero Ventura, making him the joint eighth-most capped international player of all time with Cobi Jones, and the second-most capped active international player, behind only Iker Casillas. On 15 November 2016, Buffon won his 167th Italy cap in their friendly 0–0 draw in Milan against Germany, equalling the European international appearance record jointly held by Iker Casillas and Vitālijs Astafjevs, and making him the most capped active international player in the world alongside Casillas. On 1 January 2017, Buffon was awarded the 2016 &quot;Pallone Azzurro&quot; Award, as Italy&#x27;s best international player throughout the calendar year, becoming the first player to win the award more than once. On 24 March, Buffon made his 1,000th career appearance, keeping a clean sheet (his 426th overall for club and country) in a 2–0 home over Albania in a World Cup qualifier, becoming the eighteenth player to reach this milestone; in the process, he also became the sole most capped European player at international level, with his 168th appearance for Italy, and the joint fifth-most capped male international footballer of all time, alongside Iván Hurtado.

On 2 September, Buffon made his 170th international appearance in a 3–0 away defeat to Spain in a World Cup qualifier; he later extended his European international appearance record with his 172nd appearance for Italy on 6 October, in a 1–1 home draw against Macedonia in a 2018 World Cup qualifier, making him the fourth-most capped male international footballer of all time, ahead of Egyptian striker Hossam Hassan (169 caps), and behind only Egyptian midfielder Ahmed Hassan (184 caps), Saudi Arabian goalkeeper Mohamed Al-Deayea (178 caps), and Mexican defender Claudio Suárez (177 caps).

Buffon&#x27;s 175th international appearance came on 13 November, in the second leg of the World Cup play-offs against Sweden, at the San Siro Stadium in Milan. Although he kept a clean sheet in the 0–0 draw, Italy&#x27;s 1–0 away loss in the first leg on 10 November saw Sweden advance on aggregate, meaning that Italy had failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years. Although he had originally intended to retire after competing in the 2018 World Cup, following the match and Italy&#x27;s failure to qualify the tournament, an emotional and tearful Buffon communicated his retirement from international football, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m not sorry for myself but all of Italian football. We failed at something which also means something on a social level. There&#x27;s regret at finishing like that, not because time passes. There is certainly a future for Italian football, as we have pride, ability, determination and after bad tumbles, we always find a way to get back on our feet.&quot;

He later confirmed his international retirement on social media, tweeting from the national team&#x27;s official account: &quot;We are proud, we are strong, we are stubborn. We will pick ourselves up as we have always done. I am leaving a national team set-up that will know how to pick itself up again. Best wishes to everybody, and especially to those with whom I have shared this beautiful journey.&quot; After winning the Serie A Footballer of the Year Award later that month, Buffon hinted that he could possibly play for Italy again, stating: &quot;I took a break from the national team. I&#x27;m of a certain age, so it&#x27;s right for me to take a pause. With the way I am though, both for Juventus and for the national team I have always considered myself a soldier, so I could never desert a possible call in the future if needed. Even at 60, if there were a total absence of goalkeepers and they asked me to come back, I&#x27;d be there, because I have in me the concept of nation.&quot;

On 17 March 2018, despite Buffon&#x27;s initial decision to retire, he was called up for Italy&#x27;s March friendlies against Argentina and England by caretaker manager Luigi Di Biagio. When asked why he had accepted a call-up after initially announcing his international retirement, he responded: &quot;I&#x27;m a consistent person, who feels a great sense of responsibility, that alone is enough to explain my presence. In addition, I&#x27;ve always been an unifying element in the national set-up, and I&#x27;d like my presence to be seen in this way. The young lads will grow, some already have, and from tomorrow they&#x27;ll get their chance,&quot; and &quot;I am here for Astori [a former international teammate of Buffon&#x27;s who had recently died from a heart attack] as well, it&#x27;s another reason why I wanted to be here.&quot; On 23 March, Buffon started in goal for Italy for the 176th time, in a friendly against Argentina, and also surpassed Cannavaro to become the record appearance holder as Italy captain, with 80; Italy were defeated by Argentina 2–0. On 17 May 2018, Buffon announced in a press conference with Juventus that he would not return to the national team for its May and June friendlies.

== Player profile ==
=== Style of play and reception ===
Since his emergence as a precocious talent in his youth, Buffon was renowned for his consistent performances throughout his career, and received praise from managers, players, as well as both present and former goalkeeping colleagues, for his concentration and calm composure under pressure, as well as his work-rate, and longevity. Regarded as one of the best players ever in his position, he was often considered to be the archetype of the modern goalkeeper, and has been cited by many other subsequent goalkeepers as a major influence and role model. He was described as &quot;an agile, strong, and commanding shot-stopper, who is hugely experienced at the highest level&quot; and &quot;an accomplished and well respected keeper&quot; with an &quot;[e]xcellent positional sense, courage, power and class&quot;.

Buffon was praised for his athleticism, his &quot;outstanding shot-stopping&quot;, his acrobatic dives, and his quick reflexes, as well as his ability to produce decisive saves, despite being a tall, large and physically imposing goalkeeper. Although he at times was criticised for not being particularly adept at stopping penalties, he was also proven to be effective in this area, as demonstrated by his penalty-saving record; with sixteen saves, he has stopped the joint-fifth-highest number of penalties in Serie A history, alongside Giuseppe Moro.

In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, brave, aggressive, and often instinctive and frenetic goalkeeper, who was recognised for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in one on one situations, as well as his confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines and a zonal marking system, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area on high balls; however, throughout his career, Buffon was occasionally accused by pundits of being overly cautious on crosses and of not always coming out to collect them, and also drew criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his teammates at times rather than holding on to it.

Although not as adept with the ball at his feet as the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possessed good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which enabled him to adapt to more contemporary systems requiring goalkeepers to play with their feet more frequently and be involved in the build-up of plays. His confidence in possession allowed him to play the ball out from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, as well as find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot. In his youth, his ball skills even occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.

After struggling with a series of injuries between 2008 and 2010, Buffon effectively adapted his style of goalkeeping to the physical effects of ageing, while also modifying his diet and training regime, and as a result, developed into a less spectacular, but more efficient, calm, and reflective goalkeeper; despite the loss of some of his physical strength, explosiveness, speed and mobility, he continued to excel at the highest level due to the consistency of his performances, as well as his positioning between the posts, tactical intelligence, decision-making, and his ability to read the game and organise his defence. In contrast with his goalkeeping style in his early career, Buffon often preferred to position himself in deeper areas closer to his line in his later career, particularly in one-on-one situations, in order to increase the distance between himself and his opponent, giving himself more time to assess situations and parry the ball. In addition to his goalkeeping abilities, Buffon was singled out for his charisma, strong mentality, discipline in training, vocal presence in goal, and leadership, and was described as &quot;a key dressing room personality&quot;.

=== Legacy ===
Buffon is widely regarded by players, pundits and managers as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, and by some in the sport as the greatest ever. In the introduction of his 2008 autobiography, &quot;Numero 1&quot; (Number 1), Roberto Perrone describes him as: &quot;the greatest goalkeeper in the world, one of the four or five that will always live on in the memory of world football&quot;. In 2012, he was voted the 20th best footballer in the world by The Guardian, finishing as the second-highest ranked goalkeeper, behind Iker Casillas. Buffon was awarded the Nereo Rocco Prize on 2 September 2014, which is given to a footballer in recognition of their career. In 2015, France Football rated him as one of the ten best footballers in the world over the age of 36. In 2016, he was named the greatest goalkeeper in history by the same magazine. Later that year, he was also voted the UEFA Champions League&#x27;s greatest goalkeeper of all time in an official UEFA online Twitter poll. In 2015, UEFA ranked Buffon as the third-best player ever not to have won the Champions League, while in 2019, FourFourTwo placed Buffon at number two behind only Ronaldo in their list of &quot;The 25 best players never to win the Champions League&quot;. In May 2020, Sky Sports ranked him as the fourth-best player ever to have not won the Champions League or European Cup, and he was also voted the &quot;Greatest Goalkeeper Ever&quot; by users of Eurosport.com.

=== Attire ===
Although when he started his career it was more common for goalkeepers to wear long-sleeved jerseys, Buffon was always known for wearing short-sleeves throughout his entire career, even during the winter months; when asked in a 2017 interview with FourFourTwo why he preferred to wear short sleeves, he commented: &quot;I really don&#x27;t know why. It&#x27;s just something that I&#x27;ve always done, right from the time I first started playing in goal. It always felt good. And now look: lots of goalkeepers do it. I&#x27;ve started a fashion.&quot; When asked again about his goalkeeping attire in a 2018 interview with L&#x27;Équipe&#x27;s magazine &quot;Sports et Style&quot;, he stated that he first cut the sleeves off of his goalkeeping kit as a youngster, &quot;for convenience and to feel more comfortable&quot;, also adding that he &quot;feel[s] more when the ball touches [his] forearms&quot;.

== After retirement ==
=== FIGC ===
After retiring from professional football, Buffon was appointed by the FIGC as the head of delegation of the Italy national team on 5 August 2023, a position last held by the late Gianluca Vialli. In December of that year, he received his sporting director diploma through the Coverciano technical centre.

In August 2024, Buffon received the UEFA President&#x27;s Award.

== Outside of professional football ==
=== Personal life ===
Buffon was born into a family of Italian athletes on 28 January 1978. His mother, Maria Stella, was a discus thrower and his father, Adriano, was a weightlifter. Following their athletic retirement, they subsequently worked as P.E. school teachers. Buffon&#x27;s two sisters, Veronica and Guendalina, played volleyball for the Italian national volleyball team, and his uncle, Dante Masocco, was a basketball player in Serie A1, who also represented the national team. Former Milan, Inter, and Italy goalkeeper Lorenzo Buffon is also a cousin of Gianluigi Buffon&#x27;s grandfather. Buffon is Catholic.

Buffon married Czech model Alena Šeredová in June 2011, although they had been in a relationship since 2005. They have two children, Louis Thomas (born in 2007 and named after Buffon&#x27;s idol Thomas N&#x27;Kono) and David Lee (born in 2009 and named after Van Halen singer David Lee Roth). In May 2014, Buffon announced that he had separated from his wife after three years of marriage. Louis Buffon followed in the footsteps of his father and became a footballer. As of 2025, he plays as a forward for Serie B outfit Pisa SC and received a call-up for the Czech Republic national under-18 football team.

Soon after divorce, Buffon became romantically linked to Italian sports pundit, journalist and television host Ilaria D&#x27;Amico. In 2015, Buffon announced that the couple were expecting a child together. On 6 January 2016, the couple announced the birth of their son Leopoldo Mattia. In the summer of 2017, the pair became engaged. Prior to his relationship with and marriage to Šeredová, Buffon had also previously been engaged to a sprinter from the Italy national athletics team, Vincenza Calì.

On 14 November 2008, Buffon released the Italian edition of his autobiography, &quot;Numero 1&quot; (Number 1), which was written in collaboration with writer and &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; journalist Roberto Perrone. In his autobiography, he revealed that he had suffered with bouts of depression during the 2003–04 season, following Juventus&#x27; penalty shoot-out defeat in the 2003 Champions League final, and due to Juventus&#x27; negative performance that season. In 2013, he elaborated that, between December 2003 and June 2004, he regularly visited a psychologist, but refused to take medication, and he overcame his depression prior to Euro 2004. In January 2019, he further revealed that he had even suffered from panic attacks due to his depression during his early career with Juventus, and that he even missed a game as a result.

Buffon suffers from spheksophobia, as he is allergic to wasp stings.

In his youth, Buffon supported a number of clubs, including his hometown club Carrarese, along with Genoa, and German side Borussia Mönchengladbach; up until the age of seven, he also supported Juventus, while between the ages of eight and twelve, he was a fan of Inter – due to his admiration for manager Giovanni Trapattoni – as well as Pescara, Como, Avellino, and Campobasso, before eventually supporting Genoa. He was a member of the ultras of Carrarese, specifically the &quot;Commando Ultrà Indian Tips&quot;, and to this day, he still has the group&#x27;s name printed on his goalkeeping gloves.

=== AIC ===
On 7 May 2012, Buffon was elected vice-president of the Italian Footballers&#x27; Association (AIC); this was the first time an active footballer had held this position.

=== Media and endorsements ===
Buffon was sponsored by German sportswear company Puma during his career, wearing Puma gloves and Puma King football boots, and has appeared in Puma commercials. Buffon has also featured in Pepsi commercials, including an advertisement for the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, where he lined up alongside several other footballers, including David Beckham, Raúl and Roberto Carlos, in taking on a team of sumo players. In 2009, Buffon, an avid poker player and gambler, was hired by PokerStars to endorse their products.

Buffon was featured on the cover of the Italian edition of Konami&#x27;s &quot;PES 2008&quot;, alongside global coverstar Cristiano Ronaldo. Buffon also features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, and was named alongside Manuel Neuer, Iker Casillas and Petr Čech in the Ultimate Team Best Goalkeepers in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;.

In 2011, he featured in a commercial for Italian mineral water company &quot;Ferrarelle&quot;.

In 2016, Buffon was chosen as the new face of &quot;Amica Chips&quot;. The following year, he was instead chosen as the new face of Head &amp; Shoulders in Italy.

Throughout the 2017–18 season, Buffon appeared in the Netflix docu-series &quot;First Team: Juventus&quot;.

In May 2018, Buffon announced his partnership with the video game &quot;World of Tanks&quot;. Late that same year, he also featured in a commercial for &quot;Birra Moretti&quot;.

In December 2019, Buffon announced his collaboration with the Spanish clothing and accessories retailer Kimoa, which is owned by Spanish race car driver Fernando Alonso, to release four different limited edition models of sunglasses, which represent four European cities associated with Buffon&#x27;s football career and achievements: Berlin (the location of the victorious 2006 World Cup final), Moscow (the city in which he made his international debut and won the UEFA Cup), Paris (the city in which his former club PSG is based), and Turin (the city in which his club at the time, Juventus, is based).

In January 2020, Buffon made a cameo appearance in the music video for &quot;Ti saprò aspettare&quot; by Biagio Antonacci, where he coaches a children&#x27;s football team against Antonacci as the opposing coach. In the last scene, Buffon takes a shot on Antonacci as goalkeeper, with the video intentionally stopping before the ball is either scored or saved.

=== Business ===
On 16 July 2010, Buffon became a share-holding partner of his hometown club Carrarese; he initially owned 50% of the club&#x27;s shares, along with Cristiano Lucarelli and Maurizio Mian. On 10 June 2011, he acquired an additional 20% of the club&#x27;s shares. On 6 July 2012, Buffon become the sole shareholder of Carrarese through his family&#x27;s company, Buffon &amp; co. In May 2015, Buffon stated that he would be stepping down from his position as the owner of Carrarese at the end of the 2014–15 season; in July, he sold 70% of Carrarese&#x27;s shares to the Italian real estate developer Raffaele Tartaglia, who took control of the club, although Buffon still remained with the club as a minority shareholder. After continuing to struggle with financial difficulties, the club officially declared bankruptcy on 11 March 2016.

On 30 May 2011, he joined the board of directors of the Italian textile company Zucchi Group S.p.A., with a share of 19.4%. Despite the company&#x27;s financial difficulties, in 2015, Buffon, who had by then acquired 56% of the company&#x27;s shares, had reportedly invested €20 million in order to save the company from bankruptcy. In late December, Zucchi was acquired by a French investment fund, Astrance Capital, which took control of Buffon&#x27;s company GB Holding, under an agreement to restructure Zucchi Group&#x27;s debt, while Buffon was allowed to retain a 15% share in the company.

In 2017, Buffon launched his own brand of wine under the name &quot;Buffon #1&quot;.

=== Philanthropy ===
Buffon is also known for his charity work. In addition to his other charitable endeavours, after every match he auctioned off his personalised captain&#x27;s armband for charity.

In 2012, Buffon joined the &quot;Respect Diversity&quot; Programme, through UEFA, which aimed to fight against racism, discrimination and intolerance in football.

On 1 September 2014, Buffon, along with many current and former footballing stars, took part in the &quot;Match for Peace&quot;, which was played at Rome&#x27;s Stadio Olimpico, with the proceeds being donated to charity.

In October 2019, Buffon was named a UN Goodwill Ambassador for the World Food Programme.

=== Politics ===
Prior to the 2013 Italian general election, Buffon publicly endorsed the prime minister at the time, Mario Monti. Buffon was one of over 80 Italian celebrities to sign a petition in favour of the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum promoted by the Democratic Party under then prime minister Matteo Renzi.

=== Controversy ===
While at Parma, Buffon&#x27;s decision to wear the number 88 shirt, rather than his previous number 1 shirt, for the 2000–01 season caused controversy in Italy. Buffon claimed to be unaware of the number&#x27;s neo-Nazi connotations, stating that 88 represented &quot;four balls&quot;, which are symbols of the character and attributes of a person. He stated that they were meant to signify his need for these attributes after his injury prior to Euro 2000, and that they also represented his &quot;rebirth&quot;. He subsequently offered to change numbers, choosing the squad number 77 instead.

In September 1999, Buffon faced heavy criticism and severe disciplinary sanctions for bearing the Italian fascist slogan &quot;Boia chi molla&quot; (&quot;Who gives up is a scoundrel&quot;) handwritten on a T-shirt under his goalkeeping jersey, which he wore and showed during media interviews after a match against Lazio. Buffon publicly apologised, stating that it was a stupid and naïve gesture because he was completely ignorant of the slogan&#x27;s neo-fascist connotations, stating that he had first encountered the slogan written on a boarding school desk, and was unaware of its far right-wing association and, in particular, its use with the neo-fascists in Reggio Calabria during the Reggio revolt in the early 1970s. He declared that he merely intended to use the slogan to spur on his teammates and the fans, as Parma had previously encountered some disappointing results.

In 2000, Buffon risked a four-year prison sentence for falsifying a high school accounting diploma in order to enroll for a law degree at the University of Parma, and ultimately paid a 6,350,000 Lire fine in 2001; he later described the incident as his biggest regret in life, stating that it had been a dishonest gesture.

On 12 May 2006, during the height of the &quot;Calciopoli&quot; scandal, Buffon was accused of illegally betting on Serie A matches, which initially put his place in Italy&#x27;s 2006 World Cup squad at risk. Buffon was formally interrogated and admitted placing bets on sporting matches until players were forbidden from doing so in October 2005, but denied ever placing wagers on Italian football matches. He was cleared of all charges in December 2006. Following Italy&#x27;s 2006 World Cup victory celebrations at Circus Maximus in Rome in July, he attracted further controversy when he displayed a banner he had received from the crowd, with the writing &quot;Fieri di essere italiani&quot; (&quot;Proud to be Italian&quot;), as well as a Celtic cross, a symbol adopted by neo–Nazis into the 21st century; Buffon later stated that he had not seen the symbol.

On 11 April 2018, in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League quarter-final second leg away to Real Madrid, Juventus needed a 3–0 win to force extra time, which was the scoreline when, deep into second-half stoppage time, referee Michael Oliver awarded a penalty to Real Madrid. Buffon was sent off for dissent after a confrontation with Oliver; Juventus were eliminated from the Champions League as the resulting penalty kick was converted by Cristiano Ronaldo.

Buffon&#x27;s post-match comments made about Oliver drew much media attention and controversy:
On 11 May, Buffon was charged by UEFA over post-match comments made about referee Oliver, and later, on 5 June, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body gave Buffon a three-match ban for UEFA competition matches &quot;for which he would be otherwise eligible&quot;. Buffon later issued an apology, stating:

<doc id="615878" wikidata="Q227892" url="?curid=615878" title="Alessandro Nesta">
<text>Alessandro Nesta (; born 19 March 1976) is an Italian professional football coach and former player who is the current head coach of Serie A club Monza. Usually deployed as a centre-back, he is widely considered as one of the best defenders of all time. He was best known for his pace, artistic tackles, elegance on the ball, distribution and tight marking of opponents.

He made over 400 Serie A appearances in a 20-year career spread between Lazio and AC Milan, winning domestic and European honours with both clubs. Later in his career, he played in Major League Soccer (MLS) for the Montreal Impact, and for Chennaiyin of the Indian Super League. Nesta is a four-time Serie A Defender of the Year and a four-time member of the annual UEFA Team of the Year. In 2004, he was named as one of the Top 100 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebration. In 2021, he was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame.

Nesta was a member of the Italy national team for a decade from his debut in 1996, earning 78 caps in total. At international level, he competed at the 1996 Olympics, three UEFA European Championships, and three FIFA World Cups. Nesta was a member of the Italian team that won the 2006 World Cup, and he also represented the Italian side that reached the final of Euro 2000.

==Club career==
===Lazio===
Nesta was first discovered by Francesco Rocca, a scout for Roma, but his father, a Lazio fan, turned down the offer. He began his youth career with Lazio in 1985, playing in various roles, including as a striker and midfielder, before being placed in the role of a defender. In the 1993–94 season he was called up to the first team, and on 13 March 1994 he made his debut in a 2–2 away draw against Udinese; Nesta came on for Pierluigi Casiraghi during the 78th minute.

He assumed the team captaincy in 1997 under Sven-Göran Eriksson, and helped Lazio win the 1998 Coppa Italia against AC Milan in the final 3–2 on aggregate, in which he scored the decisive goal in the second leg. He would also make the UEFA Cup Final that season, losing out 3–0 to Inter Milan. Nesta was awarded the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year Award at the 1998 Italian footballing awards for his performance throughout the season.

The following year he was forced to stay out for nearly half the season due to ligament injuries suffered during the 1998 FIFA World Cup. He returned to the field in December, and, as captain, led Lazio in the title race, lost by a single point on the final day of the season. He did, however, win the first two trophies at the international level of his team: the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, won against Mallorca, and, in August, the European Super Cup over Manchester United.

In the 1999–2000 season he led Lazio to the &quot;Scudetto&quot; and Coppa Italia, winning the double. During the 2000–01 season, under Dino Zoff, Lazio won the Supercoppa Italiana and finished third in Serie A. Nesta&#x27;s performances and success for Lazio during this period earned him three consecutive Serie A Defender of the Year awards between 2000 and 2002. Financial problems for Lazio and its then-president Sergio Cragnotti led to the sale of Nesta to Milan in 2002. Nesta left the club with a backlog salary of €2 million, half of which were converted into shares of the &quot;Biancocelesti&quot; club. He is considered to be one of the best Lazio defenders.

===AC Milan===

Just before the 2002–03 Serie A campaign, financial woes forced Lazio to sell many of their best players, including Nesta, who transferred to Milan for €30,987,000 (60 billion lire). During this time, he would form a formidable defensive line alongside Paolo Maldini, Cafu, Alessandro Costacurta and Jaap Stam, among others. Nesta&#x27;s first two seasons with the &quot;Rossoneri&quot; were very successful. During the 2002–03 season, he won the Champions League for the first time in his career as Milan defeated rivals Juventus at Old Trafford in the first all-Italian Champions League final in history. Nesta helped Milan keep a clean sheet during the match, which went to a penalty shootout following a 0–0 deadlock after extra time. Nesta was able to score his penalty kick as Milan won the shootout 3–2. Nesta also won the Coppa Italia over Roma during his first season at the club, while Milan finished third in Serie A that season. Nesta was once again awarded the Serie A Defender of the Year award for his performances, and was elected to be part of the UEFA Team of the Year.

The following season, Milan lost both the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana to Juventus and the Intercontinental Cup final to Boca Juniors, on penalties. Nesta managed to win the European Super Cup with Milan against Porto, however, and captured his second &quot;Scudetto&quot; that season, during which Milan set an Italian record for points won in a 34–match Serie A season (82). Milan were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Deportivo La Coruña, and in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, to eventual winners Lazio, although Nesta managed to score a goal in the quarter-final match against Roma. Nesta was once again elected to be part of the UEFA Team of the Year, for the third consecutive season.

Nesta began the next season by defeating his former team Lazio to capture the 2004 Supercoppa Italiana. Milan also reached the Champion&#x27;s League final in 2005, losing to Liverpool on penalties, while in Serie A, they finished behind champions Juventus. Despite finishing second in both Serie A and the Champions League, Nesta was elected to the 2005 FIFPro World XI for the first time in his career, for his performances.

During the 2005–06 AC Milan season, Milan once again finished behind Juventus in Serie A, although both Juventus and Milan were later deducted points for being involved in the 2006 matchfixing scandal, and the title was awarded to Internazionale; Juventus were relegated while Milan finishing in third place after the point deduction. Milan also reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2006, losing out to eventual champions Barcelona, while they were eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia.

Despite missing most of the 2006–07 season due to a shoulder injury, Nesta played a vital part in Milan&#x27;s return to the 2007 Champions League final, where Milan avenged their 2005 final loss, defeating Liverpool 2–1 in Athens. Despite Milan&#x27;s point deduction during the season, Nesta was also able to return from injury in time to help Milan manage a fourth-place finish in Serie A, clinching the final Champions League spot. Nesta was elected to be part of both the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFPro World XI for his performances that season.

Nesta won his third European Super Cup in August 2007 when Milan defeated Sevilla 3–1. Nesta signed a contract extension that would keep him at Milan until 2011. Nesta went on to score his first goal for Milan since April 2006 in a 1–1 draw with Siena on 15 September 2007. He followed this up with an important goal for Milan in the 4–2 victory over Boca Juniors in the final of the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup. Milan would disappoint throughout the rest of the season, however, finishing fifth in Serie A, and being eliminated in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League and the Coppa Italia.

Serious back injuries forced Nesta out of action for the whole 2008–09 season, which raised concerns about his chances to make a comeback into active football. He fully recovered from his injuries and came on as 77th-minute substitute in Milan&#x27;s final Serie A away match to Fiorentina on 31 May 2009 for his first competitive appearance of the season. Milan finished the domestic season in third place, qualifying for the Champions League.

The following season Nesta scored his first brace for Milan in a 2–1 victory over Chievo in the Serie A on 25 October 2009. He began to re-emerge as a starter for the club and was one of Milan&#x27;s most consistent players throughout the entire 2009–10 season under Leonardo, as the team finished third in Serie A. Nesta continued his excellent partnership with fellow centre-back Thiago Silva throughout the 2010–11 season under Massimiliano Allegri, forming a formidable defensive pairing, conceding just 24 goals in 38 games during Milan&#x27;s victorious Serie A campaign. Milan also managed to reach the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia, but were once again disappointingly eliminated in the round of 16 of the Champions League. Throughout the 2010–11 season, speculation indicated that Nesta would retire at the end of the season. However, he later confirmed that he wanted to play one more season at Milan before retiring and signed a contract extension on 18 May 2011, which kept him on Milan&#x27;s squad until summer 2012. Nesta was elected to be part of the Serie A Team of the Year for his performances during Milan&#x27;s successful title run that season.

Nesta began his final season with Milan by winning the 2011 Supercoppa Italiana on 6 August 2011, defeating city rivals Inter Milan 2–1 in Beijing. Milan finished second to Juventus in Serie A that season, and were eliminated in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia and the quarter-finals of the Champions League. On 10 May, during a press conference, Nesta announced his retirement from Serie A at the end of the season. During his ten seasons at the Milanese club, Nesta collected 325 caps, scoring 10 goals. With Milan, he won two Serie A titles, a Coppa Italia, two Supercoppa Italiana, two Champions Leagues, two UEFA Super Cups and a FIFA Club World Cup.

===Montreal Impact===

On 5 July 2012, Nesta signed a contract with the Montreal Impact of Major League Soccer (MLS). He signed an 18-month contract on a free transfer. The club also stated he would not be signed as a designated player. Nesta made his Impact debut against Lyon in a friendly match on 24 July. He made his competitive debut three days later, in a 3–1 home win over the New York Red Bulls. In 2013, Nesta won his first and only title with Montreal Impact: the Canadian Championship.

On 20 October 2013, Nesta announced that he would be retiring at the conclusion of the 2013 MLS Cup Playoffs after playing parts of two seasons with the Impact.

===Chennaiyin===
On 28 November 2014, it was announced that Nesta had signed for Chennaiyin FC of the Indian Super League for the remainder of the 2014 season. He was signed by Marco Materazzi, his former international defensive partner. He made his debut on 9 December in a 2–2 draw against Delhi Dynamos, partnering Mikaël Silvestre in central defence in Chennaiyin&#x27;s last match of a regular season in which they topped the league.

==International career==
===Youth===
Nesta began his career for Italy and was a member of the under-21 squad that won the 1996 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship; in the final against Spain, following a 1–1 draw, he took Italy&#x27;s fourth penalty in an eventual 4–2 shoot-out victory. A few months later, he was named to Italy&#x27;s UEFA Euro 1996 squad in England by Arrigo Sacchi, but did not come off the bench as Italy were eliminated in the group stage by eventual finalists Germany and the Czech Republic. Later that year, he took part at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta with the under-21 side, where Italy were eliminated in the first round.

===Senior===
====Early senior career====
On 5 October 1996, Nesta debuted for the Italy national football team under Cesare Maldini during a 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiction, in a 3–1 away victory against Moldova. At the final tournament, Nesta played in all three group games, playing alongside Paolo Maldini, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Costacurta and Giuseppe Bergomi, helping Italy keep a clean sheet against Cameroon. However, he did not make further appearances due to injury as Italy was eliminated by the hosts and eventual champions France on penalties in the quarter-finals.

====UEFA Euro 2000====
After featuring in defence for Italy during the Euro 2000 qualifying campaign under Dino Zoff, Nesta featured in the Italian starting lineup at Euro 2000, partnering with Paolo Maldini and Fabio Cannavaro in defence throughout most of the tournament. Italy only conceded two goals en route to the final, and kept three clean sheets throughout the tournament; the first coming against co-hosts Belgium in the group stage, and the second against Romania in the quarter-finals, in which he was named man of the match. In the semi-final, a ten-man Italy overcame co-hosts the Netherlands in a penalty shootout, after a 0–0 deadlock following extra time. Italy advanced to the final where they faced defending World Cup Champions France. Following a goal by Marco Delvecchio in the 55th minute, Italy led the match 1–0 until the final minute of stoppage time, when Sylvain Wiltord scored the equaliser. David Trezeguet then scored the golden goal in extra time for France to defeat the Italians in the second consecutive tournament, as the Italians finished the Euro as runners-up. Nesta, along with his defensive partners Maldini and Cannavaro, was elected to be part of the team of the tournament for his performances.

====2002 FIFA World Cup====
After Euro 2000, Nesta remained a first-choice centre-back for Italy under new manager Giovanni Trapattoni, featuring extensively during the 2002 World Cup qualifying campaign. During the 2002 World Cup, he partnered Fabio Cannavaro in central defence, keeping a clean sheet in the opening win against Ecuador, but once again, injury kept him from playing in the second round, and Nesta did not feature in the controversial second-round defeat to co-hosts South Korea. Nesta featured prominently as Italy topped their Euro 2004 qualifying group. However, Italy&#x27;s disappointment at major tournaments continued at Euro 2004, where they were eliminated in the first round following a three-way five-point tie with Denmark and Sweden, only to be eliminated on direct encounters. Nesta managed to stay injury free and played for a full 90 minutes in all three group games, helping Italy to keep a clean sheet in the opening draw against Denmark.

====Exclusion from 2006 World Cup and retirement====
Following two successive disappointments, newly-appointed coach Marcello Lippi kept Nesta in the starting lineup as Italy was on top of their qualification group to the 2006 World Cup. Despite starting the final tournament strongly, helping Italy to keep a clean sheet in their opening win over Ghana, the World Cup turned out to be a personal disappointment for Nesta, as an injury in the final group game against the Czech Republic, which Italy won 2–0, put him on the sidelines while Italy went on to win the trophy. After the World Cup, Nesta made one appearance in the Euro 2008 qualifiers, in a 3–1 away win against Georgia on 11 October 2006, but continuous injuries forced him to retire from the international team. Prior to the final tournament, Nesta rejected Roberto Donadoni&#x27;s invitation to return to the national team. Two years later, he similarly turned down an invitation from Marcello Lippi prior to the 2010 World Cup. He made 78 appearances for Italy in total.

==Managerial career==

===Miami===
On 31 August 2015, Nesta was introduced as the first head coach of the newly formed Miami FC, which began play in the North American Soccer League (NASL) in April 2016. After finishing a combined 7th place in his first season, Miami FC finished in first place in his second, as Spring and Fall champions of the 2017 NASL season. However, the team were defeated in the season playoffs semifinal round to the New York Cosmos following a 6–5 loss in the penalty shootout after a goalless draw. He resigned as coach following the completion of the 2017 season, on 17 November.

===Perugia===
On 14 May 2018, Nesta was appointed manager of Perugia. After a 4–1 loss to Verona in the 2018–19 Serie B promotion playoffs, Nesta parted with Perugia on 21 May 2019.

===Frosinone===
On 17 June 2019, Nesta was appointed manager of Frosinone on a two-year contract. The team finished the 2019–20 Serie B season in 8th, just making it into the playoffs. They lost the playoff final to Spezia after a 1–1 aggregate draw, as the opponents had performed better in the regular season. On 22 March 2021, Nesta was sacked.

===Reggiana===
On 13 June 2023, Nesta was appointed manager of Reggiana on a one-year contract. His team finished 11th in Serie B in his only season.

===Monza===
On 12 June 2024, Serie A side Monza announced the appointment of Nesta as head coach, starting from 1 July. He replaced Raffaele Palladino, who had left for Fiorentina after helping the team to 12th place in their second season in the top flight. He missed the first game of the season against Empoli due to suspension, debuting on 24 August with a 1–0 home loss to a Genoa team led by fellow 2006 World Cup winner Alberto Gilardino.

On 23 December 2024, Nesta was removed from his coaching post with immediate effect following a 1–2 loss to Juventus, the club&#x27;s third consecutive loss, which left Monza at the bottom of the league table with just 10 points after 17 games.

However on 10 February 2025, Nesta was again reappointed as AC Monza&#x27;s head coach just after 7 weeks of sacking him. 

==Style of play==

Nesta was a complete and dominant defender, who was influential both at club and international level, and who is regarded by pundits as being one of the greatest and most talented defenders both of his generation and of all time. Despite being a strong and imposing defensive, athletic and physical presence, he was also an extremely agile and elegant player, with excellent balance, ball skills, vision and passing ability for a defender, which allowed him to bring the ball out of the defence and start plays from the back after winning back possession; these abilities led him to be compared to former Milan captain Franco Baresi. Although he was usually deployed as a centre-back during his career, he initially started out as a right-sided full-back; his technical skills, athleticism and defensive ability made him a versatile player from a tactical standpoint, who was capable of playing anywhere along the backline, and also allowed him to be deployed on the left, or even as a sweeper on occasion. Nesta was also excellent in the air, and was unusually quick for a centreback; he often stood out throughout his career for his pace, acceleration, and stamina.

In addition to his class, as well as his technical and physical abilities, Nesta also possessed an excellent positional and tactical sense, as well as an acute capacity to read the game, which enabled him to anticipate and close down opponents in one on one situations, and prevent attacking plays; his defensive intelligence enabled him to maintain a consistently high level of performance even towards the end of his career, as he lost his pace and stamina. Due to his ability to lead from the back and organise his teammates, he excelled in a zonal marking system, but was also known for his tight marking of opposing players. An accurate and tenacious ball-winner, he was known for his artistic sliding tackles, acrobatic clearances, and ability to time his challenges well. Despite his talent, Nesta&#x27;s career suffered from the many injuries he encountered, which hindered him from playing in the knockout stages at each of the three World Cups at which he participated.

==Personal life==
On 7 May 2007, Nesta married his fiancée, Gabriela Pagnozzi, in a civil ceremony in Milan; the religious ceremony followed on 30 May 2007. Gabriela was working for &quot;Casa Italia&quot;, the Italy national team headquarters, during the 1998 World Cup. Their relationship was born when she tended to him following his injury against Austria. &quot;I can say, I got the injury and her in France then. And the injury has gone, [but] she has stayed with me.&quot; Their daughter, Sofia, was born on 19 October 2006, and on 20 March 2008, their son Tommaso was born.

<text>Francesco Totti (; born 27 September 1976) is an Italian former professional footballer who played solely for Roma and the Italy national team. He was a technically gifted and creative offensive playmaker who could play as an attacking midfielder or as a forward (second striker, lone striker, or winger).

Totti spent his entire career at Roma, winning a Serie A title, two Coppa Italia titles, and two Supercoppa Italiana titles. A prolific goalscorer, he is the second-highest scorer of all time in Italian league history with 250 goals, and is the sixth-highest scoring Italian in all competitions with 316 goals. Totti is the top goalscorer and the most capped player in Roma&#x27;s history, holds the record for the most goals scored in Serie A while playing for a single club, and also holds the record for the youngest club captain in the history of Serie A. During his career at Roma, Totti has been referred to as &quot;Er Bimbo de Oro&quot; (The Golden Boy), &quot;Er Pupone&quot; (The Big Baby), &quot;L&#x27;Ottavo Re di Roma&quot; (The Eighth King of Rome), &quot;L&#x27;Imperatore&quot; (The Emperor) and &quot;Il Capitano&quot; (The Captain) by the Italian sports media. In 2013, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as a &quot;Roman god in his game.&quot;

Totti experienced global success on the world stage winning the 2006 FIFA World Cup and appearing in the finals of UEFA Euro 2000 with Italy. Totti was selected in the All-Star team for both tournaments; he also represented his country at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004. In 2007 due to recurring physical problems, Totti announced his international retirement to focus solely on club play with Roma.

Regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation, and one of the greatest Italian footballers of all time, Totti won a record eleven Oscar del Calcio awards from the Italian Footballers&#x27; Association: five Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Footballer of the Year awards, two Serie A Goal of the Year awards, one Serie A Goalscorer of the Year award, and one Serie A Young Footballer of the Year award. He also won the 2007 European Golden Shoe and the 2010 Golden Foot. Totti was selected in the European Sports Media team of the season three times. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players as selected by Pelé, as part of FIFA&#x27;s centenary celebrations. In 2011, Totti was recognised by IFFHS as the most popular footballer in Europe. In 2015, &quot;France Football&quot; rated him as one of the ten-best footballers in the world who are over age 36. Following his retirement in 2017, Totti was awarded the Player&#x27;s Career Award and the UEFA President&#x27;s Award.

== Early life ==

Totti was born in Rome to parents Lorenzo and Fiorella Totti. He was raised in the Porta Metronia neighbourhood. As a youngster he idolised ex-Roma captain Giuseppe Giannini, and regularly played football with older boys. Totti began to play youth team football in 1984, with Fortitudo, later joining Trastevere and Lodigiani. After he came to the attention of scouts, his mother refused a lucrative offer from Milan in order to keep him in his home town. Although his youth club initially had come to an agreement to sell Totti to the Lazio youth side, one of Roma&#x27;s youth coaches, Gildo Giannini, persuaded his parents to let him join the Roma youth squad in 1989.

== Club career ==
=== Roma ===
==== 1992–1997: Early seasons ====
After three years in the youth team, Totti made his first appearance for Roma&#x27;s senior side in Serie A at the age of 16, when coach Vujadin Boškov called him up in the 2–0 away victory against Brescia on 28 March 1993. In the following season under Carlo Mazzone, Totti began to play more regularly as a second striker, and scored his first goal on 4 September 1994 in a 1–1 draw against Foggia. By 1995, Totti had become a regular in Roma&#x27;s starting line-up and scored 16 goals during the next three seasons, while creating several more, as his talent was praised by his manager Mazzone.

Following Mazzone&#x27;s sacking in the summer of 1996 and the departure of Giannini, Totti was expected to play a more prominent role, after several promising seasons; however, the team underperformed during the 1996–97 season, while Totti struggled to gain playing time under new manager Carlos Bianchi, and was even set to leave for Sampdoria on loan in January 1997. Roma&#x27;s chairman at the time however, Franco Sensi, impeded the transfer, leading to further tensions with the manager, who eventually parted ways with the club.

==== 1997–1999: Roma&#x27;s number 10 and captain ====
Totti&#x27;s years under Zdeněk Zeman represented a period of both physical and mental maturation as a player. From a technical and tactical standpoint, he proved to be compatible on the left wing in the rigid formations of the Bohemian coach, as his new role gave him more space to take on defenders in one on one situations, and cut into the centre to shoot on goal with his stronger foot; he also became physically more powerful, fit, hard-working, and complete. He displayed a greater responsibility for the team, and was presented with the number 10 jersey. His first season under Zeman started well, with Totti taking advantage of a 4–3–3 formation and making his breakthrough with the club. He finished the league season reaching double figures in goals scored for the first time in his career; including a goal in the club&#x27;s 2–0 away win against Napoli on 22 February 1998, Totti scored 13 goals in Serie A in total, and contributed to Roma&#x27;s fourth place league finish that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy Championship 1997/98&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Although he was not called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup by Italy manager Cesare Maldini, his consistent performances, creativity and goalscoring throughout the course of the previous Serie A season saw him being awarded the Guerin d&#x27;Oro for the 1997–98 season, given to him for having achieved the highest average rating of any Serie A player. The following season, he began to gain recognition as a club symbol and as a leader, and on 31 October 1998, Totti became the team captain. This made him the youngest Serie A club captain ever at 22, inheriting the armband from Aldair. On 29 November 1998, Totti scored the equalising goal in a 3–3 draw against cross-city rivals Lazio; this was his first ever goal in the Rome Derby. Overall, he scored 30 goals and provided 26 assists during Zeman&#x27;s two-year managerial stint. For his performances, he was named the Serie A Young Footballer of the Year for the 1998–99 season.

==== 1999–2004: The &quot;Scudetto&quot; as a playmaker ====
In June 1999, Roma&#x27;s then-president Franco Sensi sacked Zeman and signed Fabio Capello as a replacement, with the aim of winning the league title. By the 2000–01 campaign under the new coach, Roma were building a competitive team around Totti, who was by now being utilised as a creative attacking midfielder by Capello in a 3–4–1–2 formation, due to his passing skills and playmaking abilities. Totti scored in a 2–0 home win over Bologna on his season debut on 1 October 2000. On 10 December, Totti scored the match-winning goal in a 2–1 home win against Udinese, with a powerful left-footed volley to help Roma to their fifth home win of the season. He continued his goalscoring form by scoring against Napoli at home in a 3–0 victory on 28 January 2001, as Roma finished the first half of the league season in first place. Totti continued to play an important role in keeping the club at the top of the table throughout the remainder of the season, gaining a comfortable lead over rivals Juventus. On 17 June 2001, at the Stadio Olimpico, Roma beat Parma 3–1, with their three main attackers, Totti, Vincenzo Montella and Gabriel Batistuta scoring one goal each, as Roma were crowned champions of Italy for the third time in their history. Totti finished the league season with 13 goals, equalling what was at the time his personal goalscoring record in a single Serie A season.

On 19 August 2001, Totti won his first Supercoppa Italiana, scoring and assisting in the 3–0 win against Fiorentina. Totti was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for both 2000 and 2001, and won the Serie A Footballer of the Year Award for the first time in his career in 2000. He received his first Ballon d&#x27;Or nomination in 2000, finishing 14th in voting, and fifth the following year. Due to his performances and leadership, Totti had established himself as a hero to the Roma fans, who were also able to identify with his background as a Rome native and lifelong supporter.

Over the following seasons, Totti played in a free role as either a forward or second striker in a 3–5–2 formation, often alongside either Batistuta or the newly acquired youngster Antonio Cassano. He scored his first hat-trick in Serie A, in a 3–2 away win over Brescia on 30 September 2002. Totti also scored the only goal in Roma&#x27;s decisive 1–0 victory at the Santiago Bernabéu against Real Madrid on 30 October 2002; this was the first time in 35 years that an Italian team had won a match in Madrid. He continued his goalscoring exploits against Valencia, scoring two goals in a 3–0 win. Despite this, Roma only finished third in their Champions League group, and in eighth position in Serie A,&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy 2002/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; although they managed to reach the 2003 Coppa Italia final. In the final against Milan, Totti scored three times from free kicks over both legs (one goal at home and two at the San Siro), but Roma lost out to Milan 6–3 on aggregate. In 2003, Totti won his second Serie A Footballer of the Year Award.

In the 2003–04 season, Totti played a key role, as Roma finished runner-up to Milan in the &quot;Scudetto&quot; race. Throughout the league season, he scored 20 goals, his best haul in Serie A up to that point, which allowed him to win his second Guerin d&#x27;Oro, as the player with the best average rating in Serie A throughout the season. Moreover, the Roma captain notably scored trademark chipped goals on two occasions throughout the season, against Brescia and Empoli.
==== 2004–2009: Transition to striker ====
Despite Roma&#x27;s disappointing 2004–05 season, which saw the departure of a number of players and several managerial changes, Totti maintained consistent form by scoring twelve goals in Serie A, and 15 in all competitions, among which was his 100th Serie A goal from a free kick in a 3–3 draw against Inter Milan, on 3 October 2004. Two months later, on 19 December, he became Roma&#x27;s all-time leading scorer in Serie A after netting his 107th career league goal against Parma, breaking the record previously held by Roberto Pruzzo. Although Roma finished the league season in eighth place, Totti helped the team reach the 2005 Coppa Italia final; however Roma lost to Inter.

Roma&#x27;s new coach for the 2005–06 season, Luciano Spalletti, went with a 4–2–3–1 formation, deploying Totti in a newer, more offensive role as a lone striker. Despite his new attacking role, Totti usually dropped deep to pick up the ball in midfield rather than operating in the penalty area, thus creating space for the attacking midfielders and wingers to making offensive runs; the resulting system was later described as a 4–6–0, while Totti&#x27;s particular attacking role was dubbed the &quot;false 9&quot;. In this new position, Totti continued to score frequently, managing 15 goals in 24 league matches. In the spring of 2005, he renewed his contract until 2010, with an annual salary of €5.4 million. On 19 February 2006, he suffered a fracture of his left fibula and ligament damage during a match against Empoli, after being fouled by Richard Vanigli. Totti was at risk of missing the 2006 World Cup, but returned to the side on 11 May 2006 as a substitute in Roma&#x27;s 3–1 Coppa Italia final defeat to Inter. A metal plate had been attached to his ankle during surgery, but doctors decided not to operate again and remove it following Totti&#x27;s return, concurring that the plate would not affect his game. He was given off-label treatments of teriparatide to speed-up his fracture recovery.

The 2006–07 season was a personal high for Totti, as he scored 26 goals in Serie A, as well as another six between the Champions League (scoring three times in the group stage and once in the round of 16 tie against Lyon) and the Coppa Italia, in addition to 15 assists in 50 games across all competitions. Despite their elimination from the Champions League by Manchester United in the quarter-finals, and a second-place finish in the league, Roma won the Coppa Italia final against league champions Inter with a 6–2 victory at home (Totti scored the opening goal after 50 seconds) and a 2–1 defeat at the San Siro in Milan. Totti finished the season as Serie A top scorer with 26 goals, and on 17 June, he also received the ESM European Golden Shoe award as the top European goalscorer of the season. Despite being the highest active goalscorer in Serie A, he was not among the finalists for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year due to his absence from the national team, although he was nominated for the 2007 Ballon d&#x27;Or, finishing tenth in the voting.

On 19 August 2007, Totti contributed to Roma&#x27;s 1–0 victory over Inter in the 2007 Supercoppa Italiana, winning a penalty which was subsequently converted by Daniele De Rossi. Totti scored his 200th goal for Roma in a 4–0 victory against Torino in the Coppa Italia, on 16 January 2008. He was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for the fifth time in his career on 28 January. The following month, on 24 February, he reached 386 appearances in Serie A with Roma in a match against Fiorentina, equalling the club appearance record previously held by Giacomo Losi, Roma&#x27;s captain in the 1960s. He broke the record on 27 February, in the club&#x27;s following league match against Inter. On 9 March, he reached his 500th overall appearance for Roma, scoring the second goal of the match from a penalty kick in a 2–0 away win over Napoli. Totti suffered a season-ending injury to his right knee during a 1–1 draw with Livorno on 19 April. Tests revealed a tear of his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) that required surgery, ruling him out for four months. Roma won their ninth Coppa Italia with a 2–1 victory over Inter on 24 May; although Totti did not play the match, he was still allowed to lift the cup as the team&#x27;s captain. With this win, Totti became the most successful captain in the club&#x27;s history, with five titles and ten runners-up medals.

In the 2008–09 season, Totti recovered from the previous injury, and took part in the 2008 Supercoppa Italiana final on 24 August 2008; following a 2–2 draw with Inter after extra-time, Totti missed his penalty in the resulting shootout, which allowed Javier Zanetti to win the match for Inter with the following spot-kick. On 8 November 2008, he made his 400th appearance in Serie A, in a 1–1 away draw against Bologna, scoring the opening goal of the match. Later that month, he went on to help his team beat Lazio in the Rome derby, assisting Júlio Baptista&#x27;s match-winning goal. Totti&#x27;s run of good form continued as he provided assists for Mirko Vučinić, and scored a lobbed goal in a 3–0 win in a league game against Lecce on 23 November, while he netted a free kick in a 3–1 away win against CFR Cluj in the Champions League later that week, on 27 November. He also scored the second goal in a 2–0 win against Bordeaux on 10 December, which ensured Roma&#x27;s passage to the round of 16 of the competition as group winners. On 19 April 2009, Totti scored his 175th Serie A goal in a 3–2 home win over Lecce, overtaking Amedeo Amadei as Roma&#x27;s all-time highest goalscorer; with the goal, Totti also became one of the top-ten goalscorers in Serie A history.

==== 2009–2011: Struggles and return to form ====
Roma&#x27;s difficult start to the 2008–09 season and continued struggles at the start of the 2009–10 season saw Spalletti resign after a four-year reign, and he was replaced by Claudio Ranieri. Totti performed well in the inaugural UEFA Europa League; he scored two hat-tricks in the competition that season, first in a 7–1 away win against Gent in the third qualifying round and then another in the same scoreline against MFK Košice at the Stadio Olimpico in the play-off round. In Serie A, he also scored three goals against Bari on 22 November 2009, seven years on from his last hat-trick in Serie A. Eight days later, Totti confirmed he had signed a new five-year playing contract, which would see him stay at the club until 2014, after which he stated he would become a club director for a further five years. Roma offered him an annual salary of €8.9 million for 2009–10 and €8.6 million a year for the next four seasons.

With a 24-match unbeaten run in Serie A, Roma became the only challengers to Inter in the last three rounds for the league title that season, ultimately finishing as runner-up following the final game. Despite suffering several injury problems, Totti surpassed former prolific strikers such as Gabriel Batistuta, Giuseppe Signori, and Kurt Hamrin, putting him in sixth place in the all-time Serie A scoring records. Totti played in the Coppa Italia final against Inter on 5 May 2010, but received a red card in the closing minutes of the second half for kicking Mario Balotelli; Roma lost the match 0–1, failing to bring home a record tenth Coppa Italia title.

In the 2010–11 season, Roma suffered yet another defeat to Inter in the 2010 Supercoppa Italiana, continuing their &quot;traditional&quot; early struggles, which Totti partly blamed on Ranieri&#x27;s defensive mindset and failure to develop a consistent set of tactics. On a personal level, Totti won the Golden Foot award, but Ranieri&#x27;s lack of faith in him due to his age meant that the captain would spend a lot of time on the substitute&#x27;s bench in favour of younger forwards, such as Marco Borriello, Mirko Vučinić and Jérémy Ménez. His limited playing time, which included a controversial 91st minute substitution in a 2–1 away loss against Sampdoria, resulted in several clashes with Ranieri, and saw him fall out of form, scoring only three league goals in 21 appearances; as a result of his limited appearances, despondence and strenuous relationship with the manager, rumours even circulated in the media that Totti was considering leaving Roma. Following Roma&#x27;s 4–3 loss against Genoa on 20 February 2011, Ranieri resigned as manager, with Totti&#x27;s former teammate Vincenzo Montella appointed as caretaker coach.

Montella reverted to Spalletti&#x27;s 4–2–3–1 system and Totti appeared to recapture his best form, finding the net more frequently towards the end of the season. On 3 March, Totti was voted the best active Italian player in a poll conducted by &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot;; 100 Italian personalities including footballers, politicians and celebrities took part in the vote. On 13 March 2011, he scored two goals against Lazio which gave Roma their fifth consecutive victory in the Rome derby. The following match, on 20 March, Totti became the sixth player in Serie A history to score 200 goals, finding the target twice in a 2–2 draw against Fiorentina to total 201 league goals. On 1 May, Totti scored a brace against Bari to equal and subsequently overtake Roberto Baggio as the fifth-highest goalscorer in Serie A with his 205th and 206th career league goals, putting him behind only Silvio Piola, Gunnar Nordahl, Giuseppe Meazza and José Altafini. Totti ended the 2010–11 Serie A campaign with 15 goals – with twelve of his goals coming in Roma&#x27;s last 13 league fixtures.

At the end of the season, Roma underwent a change of ownership, with the former club owner Rosella Sensi being replaced by an American consortium led by Thomas DiBenedetto. Under the new management, the club did not offer a permanent contract to Montella, which led to him leaving to coach another Serie A side, Catania. The new management appointed Luis Enrique, who had previous coached the Barcelona B side, in a bid to emulate Barcelona&#x27;s football style.

==== 2011–2012: Back to playmaker ====
The 2011–12 season saw Totti initially receive few starts under Roma&#x27;s new manager Luis Enrique, as the club&#x27;s early struggles continued. Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 in the second half of a match against Atalanta, which kept him out of action until 20 November; he returned to the pitch against Lecce, when he came off the bench in the 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2–1.

In mid-December, as Totti began regaining form post-injury, he started playing more regularly, often in a creative role as an attacking midfielder. On 12 December, he set up Daniele De Rossi&#x27;s opening goal in a 1–1 home draw against eventual league champions Juventus, although Totti missed a second-half penalty during the match. He provided several more assists that season, notably for Dani Osvaldo&#x27;s goal in Roma&#x27;s 3–1 win over Napoli at the Stadio San Paolo on 18 December 2011, and also set up De Rossi&#x27;s goal against Catania at the Massimino stadium. Playing in a deeper position on the pitch, the Roma talisman did not seek to score goals as often, opting rather to play more of a supporting role by bridging the gap between attack and midfield, using his presence, leadership and experience in games to offer some much needed depth to the team.

On 8 January 2012, Totti scored his first goals of the season in a 2–0 win against Chievo, converting one penalty in the first half and another in the second. He went on to score two goals in a 5–1 win against Cesena which allowed Totti to set a new record, as his second goal of the match brought his tally to 211 league goals – the most any player has ever scored for a single club in Serie A. Despite his inability to find the back of the net as the second half of the season began, he continued to perform well, as he notably assisted Juan&#x27;s goal from a corner in Roma&#x27;s 4–0 win over Inter on 5 February. On 12 April, Totti scored his fifth goal of the season in a 3–1 victory over Udinese. He scored again in a 2–1 loss against Fiorentina on 25 April, and two weeks later, on his 500th match in Serie A, he scored two goals in a 2–2 draw against Catania at the Stadio Olimpico.

==== 2012–2013: Breaking records ====
After Luis Enrique decided to resign due to an unsuccessful season in which Roma failed to qualify for European football for the first time in 15 years, the club decided to appoint their former manager Zdeněk Zeman, with whom Totti would once again be reunited. Zeman tried to play Totti in a free role as a left forward or winger in his preferred 4–3–3 tactical line-up. Although this was a similar role to that which he had played during Zeman&#x27;s previous spell 13 years before, Totti&#x27;s freedom also enabled him to drop deep into the midfield to press opponents and pick up the ball, as well as attacking on the left wing. On 2 September, Totti provided two assists for Alessandro Florenzi and Dani Osvaldo in Roma&#x27;s 3–1 win over Inter at the San Siro. After the match, he received praise from the media due to his performance, even as he approached his 36th birthday. On 21 October, Totti surpassed both Giuseppe Meazza and José Altafini&#x27;s joint-record after scoring the first of Roma&#x27;s goals in a 4–2 away win at Genoa, becoming the third-highest scorer in Serie A history with 217 goals. On 8 December, Totti scored two goals, his fifth and sixth of the season, in a 4–2 home victory against Fiorentina.

Following the club&#x27;s negative performances, Zeman was sacked and replaced by the club&#x27;s technique coach Aurelio Andreazzoli in early February 2013. Under his new manager, Totti scored a goal against Juventus on 16 February, with a powerful strike, as Roma shocked the league leaders in a 1–0 win. On 3 March, he scored his 225th goal against Genoa to become Serie A&#x27;s joint second-top scorer – alongside Gunnar Nordahl – as Roma cruised to a 3–1 victory. Totti finally broke Nordahl&#x27;s record by scoring against Parma on 18 March, increasing his Serie A tally to 226 goals. On 8 April, with a goal from a penalty kick in the 1–1 draw against Lazio, he became the joint top scorer of all time in Serie A in the Rome Derby with nine goals, putting him on par with Dino da Costa and Marco Delvecchio. Totti finished the 2012–13 Serie A season with 12 goals and 12 assists from 34 appearances. Totti also reached the 2013 Coppa Italia final with Roma, but lost the match 0–1 on 26 May to cross-city rivals Lazio.

==== 2013–2015: Free forward ====
With the arrival of Roma&#x27;s new coach Rudi Garcia in the summer of 2013, Totti was once again deployed as a false 9, while also functioning as a supporting forward, or as winger on the left on occasion. On 20 September 2013, Roma announced that Totti had signed a new contract, keeping him at the club until 2016, past his 39th birthday. He scored his first goal of the 2013–14 season on 16 September, against Parma in a 3–1 victory. He followed up the goal with two strikes in Roma&#x27;s 3–0 away victory over Inter, helping the team maintain a 100% record after seven games. On 20 November, he received the &quot;Captain of Captains&quot; award by the association Editutto and Baker Tilly Revisa.

On 14 February, Totti was sidelined for about a month after sustaining a bruised right buttock. He returned to the pitch on 17 March against Udinese, scoring the first goal of the match as he helped his team to a 3–2 win. Eight days later, Totti celebrated 700 overall appearances with Roma against Torino. On 2 April, he scored his 20th career goal against Parma (a personal record against any side) in a 4–2 victory. He finished the season with eight goals and ten assists, ending the year as the top assist provider of the 2013–14 Serie A season.

Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, Totti had been one of the star players of Roma&#x27;s pre-season friendlies.
On 30 September 2014, three days after his 38th birthday, Totti scored Roma&#x27;s equaliser in a Champions League group stage draw at Manchester City, thus becoming the oldest scorer in the UEFA Champions League era; before Pepe broke his record in 2023. It was also Totti&#x27;s 300th professional career goal. On 25 October, Totti scored the opening goal from a free kick in a 1–1 draw against CSKA Moscow, extending his record of being the oldest goalscorer in the history of the competition to 38 years and 59 days.

On 11 January 2015, Totti scored two goals against local rivals Lazio, making him the joint all-time top scorer in the Rome derby in official club competitions, alongside Dino Da Costa, with eleven goals, as well as the Serie A top scorer in the Rome derby. On 9 May, Totti scored from a penalty in a 2–1 away defeat to Milan, equalling Roberto Baggio for the record of the most goals scored in Serie A from penalties (68). On 31 May, in the final match-day of the 2014–15 season, he scored his 299th goal for Roma in a 2–1 home defeat to Palermo. Totti finished the season as Roma&#x27;s leading scorer with ten goals in all competitions, the seventh time in which he had been the team&#x27;s top scorer.

==== 2015–2017: Final years as a super sub ====
On his second league appearance of the 2015–16 Serie A season, Totti scored his 300th career club goal in all competitions with Roma in a 2–2 home draw with Sassuolo, on 20 September 2015. On 26 September 2015, the day before his 39th birthday, he sustained an injury, straining his right hip flexor in a 5–1 win over Carpi, ruling him out for three months. He returned to the pitch as a substitute in a 1–1 home draw against Milan, on 9 January 2016, equalling Gianluca Pagliuca as the third all-time highest appearance holder in Serie A history, with 592 appearances.

On 21 February 2016, Totti publicly criticised returning manager – and Rudi Garcia&#x27;s replacement – Luciano Spalletti in the media for his lack of playing time since his return from injury. He was subsequently dropped for Roma&#x27;s 5–0 win over Palermo, with the decision causing an uproar among the fans and in the media, while rumours once again began to circulate that Totti would be leaving the club once his contract had expired at the end of the season, as a result of his limited appearances and clashes with Spalletti. On 8 March, Totti came on as a substitute for Stephan El Shaarawy in the return leg of the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League against Real Madrid, and was given a standing ovation by the fans at the Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid; Roma lost the match 2–0, however, and were eliminated from the competition following a 4–0 aggregate loss. On 20 April, he came off the bench in the 86th minute, one goal down to Torino at home to rescue the team with a brace; one in the 87th minute and a penalty in the 89th minute to win the match 3–2. With his 69th goal in Serie A from the penalty spot, he overtook Roberto Baggio as the outright top scorer of penalties in Serie A history. Totti&#x27;s double also made him the oldest player in Serie A history to score two goals in a single league match, at the age of 39 years, 6 months and 23 days, breaking Silvio Piola&#x27;s previous record of 39 years, 4 months and 2 days, which he had managed with Novara on 1 February 1953, after scoring a brace against his former team Lazio.

On 2 May, Totti came off the bench and scored from a free kick to help Roma to come from behind and achieve a 3–2 away win over Genoa; this was his 21st goal from a free kick in Serie A, which put him alongside Baggio as the joint all-time fourth-highest scorer of free kicks in Serie A history, behind only Alessandro Del Piero, Andrea Pirlo, and Siniša Mihajlović. Totti came off the bench in each of the past five Serie A games and contributed four goals and an assist. On 8 May, Totti came off the bench to set up Roma&#x27;s final goal in a 3–0 home win over Chievo in his 600th Serie A appearance, becoming the third player ever to reach this milestone. Overall, Totti only made 13 league appearances throughout the season but scored four goals in the final six matches as a substitute. On 7 June, he renewed his contract for another year, stating that he would be retiring at the end of the 2016–17 season; he also revealed he had signed a six-year contract to become Roma&#x27;s technical director once the season ended.

On his first appearance of the 2016–17 season against Sampdoria on 11 September, Totti equalled Paolo Maldini&#x27;s record of playing in 25 Serie A seasons. With Roma trailing 2–1 at half time, Totti came off the bench and assisted Edin Džeko&#x27;s temporary equaliser, later also scoring the match-winning goal from a penalty in injury time to secure a 3–2 home win in Serie A; Totti&#x27;s goal meant that he had managed to score at least once in each of the past 23 consecutive seasons of his career. On 25 September, he scored his 250th Serie A goal from the penalty spot in a 3–1 away defeat to Torino, just two days before his 40th birthday. On his first start two days after his 40th birthday, on 29 September, Totti was praised for his performance and longevity in a 4–0 home win over Astra Giurgiu in the Europa League; he played all 90 minutes of the match, providing two assists, while also being involved in a third goal. On 20 October, Totti made his 100th appearance in UEFA club competitions, setting up two goals in a 3–3 home draw against Austria Wien in the Europa League. In late October, he sustained a muscle injury to the flexor of his left thigh during a training session, which ruled him out indefinitely. He returned to action as a substitute in a 3–2 home win over Pescara on 27 November.

On 1 February 2017, Totti scored a decisive injury-time penalty in the 97th minute of a 2–1 home victory against Cesena in the Coppa Italia quarter-finals; the win enabled Roma to advance to the semi-finals of the tournament. On 15 April, he came on as a substitute in a 1–1 home draw against Atalanta to make his 615th appearance in Serie A, equalling Javier Zanetti as the joint third highest appearance holder of all time in Serie A.

On 28 May, Totti made his final appearance for Roma in a 3–2 home win against Genoa, coming on as a substitute for Mohamed Salah in the 54th minute, and received a standing ovation from the fans.

== International career ==
=== Youth career and early senior career ===
Totti first came into international prominence while playing in FIFA and UEFA youth tournaments. With the Italy under-16 side, under manager Sergio Vatta, Totti reached the final of the 1993 UEFA European Under-16 Championship in Turkey; Italy were defeated 1–0 by Poland, as Totti missed the final due to suspension. Four months later, Totti played in 1993 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Japan and scored Italy&#x27;s goal in the tournament as the &quot;Azzurrini&quot; were eliminated in group stage. Totti also scored in Italy&#x27;s 4–1 defeat to Spain in the final of the UEFA Under-18 Championship, in July 1995. He subsequently won the UEFA Under-21 Championship with Italy in 1996, under manager Cesare Maldini; in the final, he opened the scoring as the match ended in a 1–1 draw against Spain, although Italy were able to win the final on penalties. The following year, he also played a key role in helping Italy to win a gold medal at the 1997 Mediterranean Games, on home soil, scoring twice throughout the tournament. Due to his contribution in these tournaments, Totti was later included in the all-time Under-21 Euro dream team in 2015.

After starring with the &quot;Azzurrini&quot; in Italy&#x27;s under-16, under-19 and under-21 sides, Totti earned his first senior cap for Italy under the recently appointed international manager Dino Zoff during a 2–0 Euro 2000 qualifying victory against Switzerland on 10 October 1998. Totti scored his first goal for Italy on 26 April 2000 in a 2–0 friendly win over Portugal in Reggio Calabria. He scored his first brace for Italy in a 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification match in a 4–3 home win over Belarus, on 13 October 2004. In total, Totti made 58 appearances for Italy between 1998 and 2006, scoring nine goals and providing 25 assists.

=== Euro 2000 ===

Italy went to Euro 2000 with Totti in excellent form. Overall, he scored two goals and provided an assist during the tournament. His first goal of the tournament came against co-host nation Belgium in the first round, as Totti headed in Demetrio Albertini&#x27;s cross from a set-piece; he was named man of the match for his performance. His second goal of the tournament came against Romania in the quarter-finals, with an accurate strike following Stefano Fiore&#x27;s assist. In Italy&#x27;s semi-final shootout victory over co-hosts the Netherlands, Totti&#x27;s confidently chipped penalty was named as one of the &quot;magic moments&quot; of the tournament. A few moments before taking the penalty, Totti whispered the famous sentence &quot;Mo je faccio er Cucchiaio&quot; (Roman dialect for &quot;Now I&#x27;m scoring with a Panenka&quot;) to his teammate and friend Luigi Di Biagio.

Though Italy lost to reigning World Cup Champions France 2–1 in extra time in the final, he started the play which led to Marco Delvecchio&#x27;s opening goal; Totti sent an unmarked Gianluca Pessotto down the right wing with a back-heel pass, allowing him space to cross the ball into the area, where it was put into the net by Delvecchio. Later, during the second half of the match, Totti provided two scoring opportunities for Alessandro Del Piero, which the Juventus forward was unable to convert. Some UEFA sources credit Totti as the &quot;man of the match&quot; for the Euro 2000 final, due to his performance; however, UEFA&#x27;s Technical Study Group named French forward Thierry Henry as the award winner. Totti was selected for the 22-man Team of the Tournament due to his performances throughout the European Championship.

=== 2002 World Cup ===
After being handed the number 10 shirt and Italy&#x27;s playmaking duties, much was expected of Totti in his debut World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni. Despite a promising start at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea, as he set-up Christian Vieri&#x27;s first goal in Italy&#x27;s 2–0 opening win over Ecuador, disappointment followed, with Totti failing to score or make a significant impact throughout the tournament. Despite helping to set up Vieri&#x27;s goal in a disappointing and controversial 2–1 defeat to Croatia in Italy&#x27;s second group match, his lacklustre performances throughout the tournament were later criticised by the Italian media, in particular his failure to capitalise on several scoring chances in Italy&#x27;s 1–1 draw against Mexico in their final group match, as Italy only narrowly qualified for the knockout stage.

Despite setting up Vieri&#x27;s goal in Italy&#x27;s second round defeat to co-hosts South Korea from a corner, his performance was once again criticised, in particular as he was sent off in extra time after being handed a controversial second yellow card by referee Byron Moreno for simulation.

=== Euro 2004 ===
Although he was once again expected to be Italy&#x27;s star player in the number 10 role, Totti acquired a measure of infamy at Euro 2004 after he spat at Danish midfielder Christian Poulsen in a goalless draw in Italy&#x27;s opening group match of the tournament on 14 June 2004. He was subsequently banned until the semi-finals, but never made it back to action and finished the competition scoreless due to Italy&#x27;s elimination in the first round on direct encounters, following a three-way five point tie with Sweden and Denmark.

=== 2006 World Cup ===
Despite injury troubles, Totti recovered in time to join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, despite a lack of match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy&#x27;s World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti&#x27;s desire to work even harder to overcome what could have been a career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media&#x27;s opinion).

Totti did recuperate in time and was eventually named to Lippi&#x27;s final 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup. Despite initial concerns over his match fitness, Totti was an important player in Marcello Lippi&#x27;s team, and played in all seven games for Italy, including the victorious final against France, which Italy won on penalties, although he was substituted off in the 61st minute. He played the entire time in Germany with metal plates and screws in his ankle that had yet to be removed following the surgery. Throughout the tournament, he usually played as an attacking midfielder, in front of deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo, and behind strikers Luca Toni, Alberto Gilardino, Vincenzo Iaquinta, or Filippo Inzaghi; these players were supported defensively by Gennaro Gattuso, Simone Perrotta and Daniele De Rossi in midfield. Totti finished the tournament with the joint-highest number of assists, along with Juan Román Riquelme (4). Totti set up Pirlo&#x27;s goal from a short corner in Italy&#x27;s opening 2–0 win against Ghana, Marco Materazzi&#x27;s goal from a corner in Italy&#x27;s final group match, a 2–0 win against the Czech Republic, and two goals in a 3–0 win against Ukraine in the quarter-finals: the opener by Gianluca Zambrotta, and one of Luca Toni&#x27;s goals. Totti also scored a goal via an injury-time penalty in Italy&#x27;s 1–0 round of 16 win over Australia on 26 June, and was involved in Del Piero&#x27;s last-minute extra-time goal in the semi-final, which sealed a 2–0 victory for the Italians over hosts Germany, and a place in the World Cup final. Throughout the competition, Totti completed 185 passes and took 19 shots; in recognition of a successful tournament, he was selected for the 23-man All-Star Team.

=== Retirement ===
Totti intended to retire from international football after the 2006 World Cup, but reneged on his decision and remained undecided on his future for over a year, not being called up in the meantime. He made his retirement official on 20 July 2007, at the beginning of the 2007–08 Serie A season, due to recurring physical problems and in order to focus solely on club play with Roma. Italy&#x27;s coach at the time, Roberto Donadoni, attempted to get Totti to change his mind for the remaining Euro 2008 qualifiers but was not successful.

After Marcello Lippi&#x27;s reappointment as the national team&#x27;s manager following Euro 2008, Totti announced that he would play in the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa if he were to receive a call-up; however, there was no official statement release from Totti or Lippi about a possible comeback. For the final tournament, Totti was not named in the 23-man squad, and Italy was subsequently eliminated, failing to win a match and finishing last in their group, their worst-ever World Cup performance. Diego Maradona and former national teammates Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluigi Buffon said one of the reasons for Italy&#x27;s early exit was due to the lack of creative players like Totti in the team.

In March 2013, Lippi&#x27;s successor as Italy&#x27;s coach, Cesare Prandelli, stated that he would consider Totti for the 2014 World Cup squad. In October 2013, Prandelli said, &quot;Totti is in fantastic form. His condition right now does make you reflect. If the World Cup was around the corner, I would have no doubts and would absolutely call him up. But we will evaluate the player&#x27;s condition one month prior to the World Cup.&quot; However, at the time of the choice of the final 23-man Italian squad for the World Cup, the Italy coach excluded the Roma striker, preferring to focus the team around younger players. Some in the media criticised the decision, such as former Brazilian international footballer Cafu, who had been Totti&#x27;s teammate at Roma, who revealed that he would have liked to see Totti competing for Italy at the World Cup in Brazil, and that he preferred the Roma captain over Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Without Totti, Italy was eliminated in the first round for the second consecutive time, finishing third in their group.

In May 2016, several injuries in the Italian squad, as well as a lack of attacking options and Totti&#x27;s run of good form as a substitute for Roma, led some in the media to call for manager Antonio Conte to include Totti as a reserve in Italy&#x27;s Euro 2016 squad; however, he was later left out of Conte&#x27;s 30-man preliminary Italy squad for the final tournament.

== Player profile ==


=== Style of play ===

Often referred to as &quot;Er Bimbo de Oro&quot; (The Golden Boy), &quot;L&#x27;Ottavo Re di Roma&quot; (The Eighth King of Rome), &quot;Er Pupone&quot; (The Big Baby), &quot;Il Capitano&quot; (The Captain), and &quot;Il Gladiatore&quot; (The Gladiator) by the Italian sports media, Totti is considered to be one of the greatest Italian players of all time, one of the best players of his generation, and Roma&#x27;s greatest ever player. Totti is also regarded by some as Italy&#x27;s greatest player ever. Throughout his career, he played predominantly as a classic number 10, functioning either as an offensive-midfield playmaker or as a supporting or deep-lying forward behind the main striker; only in the later years of his Roma career was he mainly employed as a lone striker. An elegant, world-class, and technically gifted attacking midfielder with a good knowledge of the game, Totti was a tactically versatile player, capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and was also occasionally deployed as a winger or as a central midfielder under Zdeněk Zeman, and most notably as a false 9 under Luciano Spalletti and Rudi Garcia. Under Luis Enrique, he was also occasionally fielded in a more withdrawn creative role in midfield, functioning as a deep-lying playmaker.

While Totti was a prolific goalscorer, he was also renowned for his ball control, vision, creativity, and range of passing, as well as his ability to set the pace in midfield and provide through-balls and assists for his teammates, often through his trademark use of the no-look pass or backheel, in particular when holding up the ball or playing with his back to goal. Throughout his career, Totti drew particular praise from pundits for his excellent vision, technique, and precise long passing ability, which allowed him to play the ball first-time. Due to his movement and range of skills, his role has at times been described as that of a hardworking, unselfish and dynamic centre-forward, known as a &quot;centravanti di manovra&quot; in Italian (which literally translates to &quot;manoeuvring centre-forward&quot;). Known for his work rate, longevity, and willingness to contribute defensively, Totti underwent an athletic development during his time under Zeman: he undertook a muscle-strengthening programme to adapt to the rhythms of 21st-century football, gaining physical strength, stamina, fitness and shooting power to the detriment of some of his speed and agility, which also enabled him to maintain a consistent level of performance in his later career.

Throughout his career, Totti utilised his balance, dribbling skills, and acceleration in order to get past opponents; despite being naturally right-footed, he possessed a powerful and accurate shot from both inside and outside the area with either foot, and was also an accurate penalty kick and free kick taker, who was capable of striking the ball either with power or swerve from set pieces. Totti also scored several goals from chipped shots throughout his career, and often used the technique on penalties, which was also known as the &quot;cucchiaio&quot; technique (or &quot;spoon&quot; in Italian); one of the most famous instances in which Totti performed this type of penalty was in the victorious shootout of Italy&#x27;s Euro 2000 semi-final match against the Netherlands. One of his most famous lobbed goals, in which he dribbled past Inter&#x27;s Marco Materazzi before chipping the ball over goalkeeper Júlio César, was later named the best goal in Serie A of the 2005–06 season. He scored another notable goal using this technique against Lazio in the 2002 &quot;Derby della Capitale&quot;, which ended in a 5–1 win for Roma. The title of Totti&#x27;s 2006 autobiography &quot;Tutto Totti&quot;: &quot;Mo je faccio er cucchiaio&quot; (: &quot;I&#x27;m gonna chip him now&quot;) referenced this technique, as well as the statement made to his Italy teammates before his memorable Euro 2000 semi-final shootout penalty against the Netherlands. Having served as Roma&#x27;s captain for several years, Totti was praised for his leadership. Italian former footballer Roberto Mancini likened Totti&#x27;s playing style to his own in 2016, due to his movement, quality, and intuition.

Despite his talent and ability, however, Totti drew criticism at times for his character and lack of discipline on the pitch, which occasionally caused him to commit bad fouls and receive unnecessary bookings; with eleven red cards, he has the joint-sixth highest number of sending offs in Serie A history.

=== Goal celebrations ===
Totti was known for his exuberant and humorous goal celebrations. One of his famous celebrations took place on 11 April 1999 in the second &quot;Derby della Capitale&quot; of the 1998–99 season, in which he scored during the final minutes of the game and celebrated by flashing a T-shirt under his jersey, which read &quot;Vi ho purgato ancora&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;ve purged you guys again&quot;), in reference to events at the previous derby against Lazio on 29 November 1998 when Totti helped Roma come back from 3–1 down with an assist to Eusebio Di Francesco for 3–2 and finally a goal of his own for 3–3. Another derby goal against Lazio saw him take over a sideline camera and aim it at the Roma fans.

Totti has displayed numerous T-shirts with messages on them from under his jersey over the years, including two for his wife; &quot;6 Unica&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re One of a kind&quot;) and &quot;6 Sempre Unica&quot; (&quot;You&#x27;re Still the One&quot;), and a political one &quot;Liberate Giuliana&quot; (&quot;Free Giuliana&quot;) in honor of Giuliana Sgrena, an Italian journalist kidnapped in 2005 by insurgents in Iraq who was later freed. The most recent message was &quot;Scusate il Ritardo&quot; (&quot;Sorry for the delay&quot;) which he flashed on 8 January 2012 as an apology to fans for his goalscoring drought after scoring his first goal of the season versus Chievo.

As a tribute to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a childbirth scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and lying on his back while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the birth of his daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the &quot;Derby della Capitale&quot; as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.

== After retirement ==
On 17 July 2017, Totti confirmed his retirement from professional football and announced that he had accepted an offer from his former team to become a club director. On 18 September, Totti began studying for a course in order to obtain his UEFA B coaching licence. However, he withdrew from the course two weeks later, as he was unable to attend the course regularly due to his commitments as a director of Roma; his former teammate Simone Perrotta took his place.

On 17 June 2019, he announced his resignation from his role at Roma, in an hour-long press conference held at the Italian Olympic Committee headquarters, where he publicly accused chairman James Pallotta and the management for not involving him enough in the club&#x27;s decision making, stating he would reconsider a comeback only under a different ownership. This marked the end of his 30-year association with the club.

== Outside of professional football ==
=== Personal life ===

Totti married Ilary Blasi, a former showgirl and a co-host of Italia 1&#x27;s &quot;Le Iene&quot;, on 19 June 2005 at the Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Their wedding was aired on television, with the proceeds being donated to charity. They had their first child on 6 November 2005. Their second child, a daughter, was born on 13 May 2007. The couple had often been referred to as the &quot;Italian Beckhams&quot;, and their private lives are often speculated upon in Italian magazines and tabloids. On 10 March 2016, the couple had their third child.

On 12 October 2020, Totti&#x27;s father, Enzo, died at 76 years old due to COVID-19, amid the pandemic in Italy. In the aftermath, Totti struggled with his mental health and discovered evidence of Blasi&#x27;s infidelity. On 11 July 2022, it was announced that Totti and Blasi had separated. Totti has since started a relationship with Noemi Bocchi.
In October 2024, Totti ended his relationship with Bocchi, and began a new relationship with sports journalist Marialuisa Jacobelli.
Totti is a Roman Catholic.

Totti&#x27;s brother Riccardo serves as his agent, and manages many of his brand and business interests, under the name Number Ten, including the Francesco Totti Academy, a football training school, and the Totti Soccer School, a football camp for children with disabilities. Totti also owns a motorcycle racing team called Totti Top Sport.

=== Philanthropy ===
Totti became a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF in 2003, and an ambassador for the FIFA/SOS Children&#x27;s Villages in January 2006. As a fundraiser for a children&#x27;s charity, he published two best-selling, self-effacing joke books, containing jokes the locals often told about him and his teammates. Some of the jokes were filmed in short sketches, featuring himself with good friends and national teammates Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Christian Vieri, Antonio Cassano, Marco Delvecchio, Alessandro Nesta and former national team coach Giovanni Trapattoni in a short show called &quot;La sai l&#x27;ultima di Totti&quot;. On 16 January 2008, he appeared as &quot;PaperTotti&quot; in the Disney comic series &quot;Topolino&quot;. The proceeds of the subscriptions were given to charity. The Roma captain&#x27;s official testimonial was a fundraising match between singers and celebrities played on 12 May 2008 to help raise money for the construction of the Campus Produttivo della Legalità e della Solidarietà (Productive Campus of Legality and Solidarity).

In 2009, Totti helped launch a new campaign promoting Football Adopting Abandoned Children, which came about in collaboration with the Friends of Children and the Association of Italian Players. In the project, he adopted a team of around eleven young Kenyans to play football in Nairobi, and then to coach them along the way. In 2015, Totti and several of his teammates took to the pitch for &quot;Tennis with Stars&quot; in the Foro Italico in Rome, an event to help disadvantaged children. Tennis players such as Novak Djokovic and Flavia Pennetta participated at the event. On 27 September 2016, Totti celebrated his 40th birthday live on his new Facebook page, at the Tor Crescenza castle in Rome.

Totti recorded a video message for a comatose hospital patient who awoke from her coma when his voice was played; Totti visited the patient in the hospital in September 2020.

=== Television, cinema and publicity ===
In 2002, Fiat principal executive Gianni Agnelli, a lifelong fan and ex-president of Juventus, chose Totti to publicize the launch of the new Stilo instead of a Juventus player. Having been signed to sportswear company Nike, Totti featured in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; advertisement, directed by Terry Gilliam, in the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan. He appeared alongside Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Luís Figo, Roberto Carlos and Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

Totti has featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he appeared on the cover of the Italian edition of &quot;FIFA 2002&quot;. He also featured on the cover of &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 4&quot;, along with Thierry Henry and Italian referee Pierluigi Collina. Between 2005 and 2008, his sponsors changed to sportswear company Diadora and soft drink Pepsi Twist, with a commercial filmed in the camps of Trigoria by director Gabriele Muccino. Since May 2006, he has appeared in advertisements for telephone company Vodafone. In December 2006, Totti and his wife Ilary Blasi lent their voices to an Italian dubbing of an episode of the television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; entitled &quot;Marge and Homer Turn a Couple Play&quot;, in which Totti voiced Buck Mitchell.
In 2007, he appeared in the movie &quot;L&#x27;allenatore nel Pallone 2&quot;, in the role of a defense attorney. Since 2008, he has participated several times in the television program &quot;C&#x27;è posta per te&quot;, in the second series of the Italian drama &quot;Cesaroni&quot;, in the reality show &quot;Grande Fratello 8&quot; and in an episode of &quot;Paperissima&quot;. In September 2008, a collection of figurines dedicated to him appeared in newsstands in the Lazio region entitled &quot;Francesco Totti, the captain&quot;. In 2009, Totti sent a message of support to Iranian youths during the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests. In February 2010, Totti was named an ambassador for online poker company Party Poker.

In May 2010, Totti appeared alongside actor Russell Crowe in Rome to promote the special edition of the film &quot;Gladiator&quot;, celebrating the tenth anniversary of the film&#x27;s release. In December 2014, two murals of Totti, sponsored by Nike, were created in Rome. In 2014, the Swiss artist David Diehl painted Totti as one of 16 football icons most beloved by their fans. In 2015, &quot;France Football&quot; rated him one of the ten best footballers in the world over the age of 36. In 2015, Totti&#x27;s famous selfie goal celebration was included amongst the goal celebrations available for &quot;FIFA 16&quot; and &quot;Pro Evolution Soccer 2016&quot;; he also took a selfie in the official trailer of the video game on YouTube. On 1 August 2017, a rocket carrying Totti&#x27;s number 10 shirt from his final game with Roma against Genoa was launched into space from French Guiana.

In 2020 he was the subject of &quot;My Name Is Francesco Totti (Mi chiamo Francesco Totti)&quot;, a documentary film by Alex Infascelli.

In March 2024, Betsson launched its Betsson.Sport infotainment platform in Italy with Totti as ambassador. Totti, along with Bebe Vio, will be ambassadors for the 2026 Winter Olympics hosted in Milano and Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo.

<text>These are the &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number one hits of 1974.

That year, 25 acts earn their first number one song, such as Steve Miller Band, Al Wilson, Barbra Streisand, Love Unlimited Orchestra, Terry Jacks, John Denver, Blue Swede, MFSB, The Three Degrees, Bo Donaldson and The Heywoods, Gordon Lightfoot, The Hues Corporation, George McCrae, Paper Lace, Odia Coates, Eric Clapton, Barry White, Andy Kim, Olivia Newton-John, Dionne Warwick, The Spinners, Bachman–Turner Overdrive, Billy Swan, Carl Douglas, and Harry Chapin. John Lennon, having already hit number one with The Beatles, earns his first number one song as a solo act. John Denver was the only act to have more than one song reach number one, with two.

1974 is tied with 1975 for scoring the most Hot 100 number ones, 35 each. The year would have more number ones than 1975, at 36, if including &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot; by Jim Croce, which initially topped the Hot 100 on December 29, 1973, and stayed atop the chart to start 1974.

<doc id="615887" wikidata="Q188696" url="?curid=615887" title="Christian Vieri">
<text>Christian Vieri (; born 12 July 1973), commonly known as Bobo Vieri, is an Italian former professional footballer who played as a centre forward. Having been born in Italy, Vieri moved with his family to Australia as a child, before returning to Italy to pursue his professional career at a young age. He then spent the bulk of his career playing in the Serie A. In March 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living footballers selected by Pelé as a part of FIFA&#x27;s centenary celebrations.

A prolific goalscorer, for a number of years, he was regarded as one of the best strikers of this generation, leading to him becoming the world&#x27;s most expensive player in 1999 when Inter Milan paid Lazio £32 million (€43 million) for his services. Something of a footballing nomad, Vieri played for no fewer than 12 clubs throughout his career, mainly in Italy, but also in Spain and France. He started his career with Torino in 1991, but his most notable and successful spells were those at Juventus, Atlético Madrid, Lazio and Inter, clubs with which he won several honours.

As well as picking up several winners medals during his career, Vieri also claimed many individual awards including the Pichichi Trophy and &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; awards for the league&#x27;s top scorer in Spain and Italy respectively, and the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year twice. At international level, Vieri scored 23 goals in 49 appearances for Italy between 1997 and 2005, and is the joint ninth-highest goalscorer for his national team, alongside Francesco Graziani. He is also Italy&#x27;s highest ever goalscorer in the FIFA World Cup, along with Roberto Baggio and Paolo Rossi, with a combined nine goals from nine matches at the 1998 and 2002 editions of the tournament; he also took part at Euro 2004.

==Early life==
Born in Bologna, Italy, to active professional footballer Roberto Vieri and Christiane &quot;Nathalie&quot; Rivaux, Vieri is of Italian and French descent as his mother was born in Casablanca and raised in Paris. He spent the first years of his life in the capital of the Emilia-Romagna region while his Prato-born father played for Bologna. With Roberto Vieri&#x27;s 1977 transfer to Marconi Stallions, the family moved to Sydney, Australia, residing in the suburb of Wetherill Park in South Western Sydney, where young Christian attended Patrician Brothers&#x27; College, Fairfield. It is from his father that he inherited his nickname &quot;Bobo&quot; which he carried with him throughout his career.

During his time in Australia, Vieri developed a love for both football and cricket, a sport he still follows to this day. He stated in an interview that he would have liked to have been a professional cricketer. His younger brother, Massimiliano &quot;Max&quot; Vieri, was also a professional footballer and was an Australian international in 2004. Vieri played for Marconi Juniors when he was a child but his family subsequently moved back to Italy. In an interview at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Vieri named his all-time sporting hero as Australian cricketer Allan Border, and said that as a child he was better at cricket than football.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Vieri started his playing career at Marconi Stallions. Upon his return to Italy in 1988, his first club was Santa Lucia, a team from Prato, where his first coach was Luciano Diamanti, the father of the player Alessandro Diamanti. The next year he became affiliated with Prato and scored several goals in the Campionato Nazionale Dante Berretti.

The following year, he moved to Torino after being spotted by Serino Rampanti, who recommended him to the coach Sergio Vatta. The president of the Prato, Andrea Toccafondi, did not want to sell the promising striker. To convince him to sell Vieri to Torino, the &quot;Granata&quot; also had to buy the son of Toccafondi, Paolo, who was a goalkeeper. After a year in the Torino youth ranks, Vieri was given his first team debut at age 18, on 30 October 1991 in the 1991–92 Coppa Italia under Emiliano Mondonico; he scored the second goal in a 2–0 win for Torino against Lazio. On 15 December of the same year, he made his official debut in Serie A during the final minutes of a home game against Fiorentina (2–0). He would later score his first goal in the league in a match won 4–0 against Genoa. At the end of the 1991–92 season, Vieri would pick up a runners up medal as an unused substitute in the 1992 UEFA Cup final, lost on away goals to Ajax.

In November 1992, Vieri was sold to Serie B club Pisa, scoring two goals in 18 appearances. He would only stay in Pisa for one season, moving to fellow Serie B side Ravenna for the 1993–94 season, where he scored 12 goals in 32 appearances. He was subsequently transferred to another Serie B club for the 1994–95 season, Venezia, where he scored 11 goals in 29 appearances.

===Serie A===
After three seasons in Serie B, Vieri returned to Serie A for the 1995–96 season, when he joined Atalanta, scoring 9 goals in 21 appearances.

His first big move came when he was signed by Juventus from Atalanta for a fee of €2.5 million for the 1996–97 season. He made 23 appearances and scored 8 goals in Serie A, and six goals in ten matches in Europe, making him joint top scorer for Juventus that season along with Alen Bokšić. He ended his season at Juve by winning the &quot;&#x27;Scudetto&quot; and starting in the 3–1 UEFA Champions League final loss to Borussia Dortmund.

===Atlético Madrid===
Vieri&#x27;s form for Juventus attracted the attention of Spanish side Atlético Madrid who paid £12.5 million to sign the striker in 1997. He was part of a £45 million spending spree for the club owned by Jesús Gil that season, alongside Juninho Paulista.

Vieri made his debut for Atlético on 30 August 1997 in a 1–1 draw with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on the first day of the La Liga season. He scored his first goal on 16 September, a penalty in a 2–1 home win against Leicester City in the first round of the UEFA Cup. Eleven days later he opened his league account with two goals in a 3–3 home draw with Celta. In October, he scored back-to-back hat-tricks in a 5–1 win at Real Zaragoza and a 5–2 home win over PAOK in the quarter-finals of the European competition. On 21 March 1998, he scored four times away to Salamanca, but the &quot;Rojiblancos&quot; lost 5–4.

He scored a total of 24 goals in 24 league appearances for Atlético and finished the season with 29 goals from 32 appearances, which saw him receive the Pichichi Trophy as the league&#x27;s top scorer.

Vieri stated in his 2015 autobiography that his 1997 transfer to Atlético was motivated purely by financial reasons—revealing that Juventus would only pay him an annual salary of L.2 million while the Spanish club were offering the equivalent of L.3.5 million. He furthermore asserted: &quot;If I could have turned back time, I’d have stayed in Turin&quot;.

Vieri also revealed a funny story about the aforementioned back-to-back hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza and PAOK. Before the match with PAOK, Vieri made a bet with Jesús Gil: if he had scored a hat-trick, the President would have given him a Ferrari. The striker did find the net three times, with the third goal, scored from the goal line, being one of the most iconic moments of his career, and Gil made him choose his gift car. However, Vieri never picked up his Ferrari at the end of the season, as he felt he had betrayed the President leaving Atlético after just one year.

===Lazio===
After his performances for Atlético and at the 1998 World Cup, Vieri returned to Serie A with Lazio for a fee of €25 million. He partnered Chilean international Marcelo Salas for the Rome-based club, managed by Sven-Göran Eriksson. He had a successful season, scoring 14 goals in 28 appearances, and won the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. He scored the first goal of the 2–1 win over Mallorca in the final at Villa Park on 19 May, the last match in the tournament&#x27;s history.

===Inter Milan===
The following season Vieri was the subject of a then world record transfer of €49 million (90 billion Italian lire, £32 million) to Inter Milan after drawing the attention of chairman Massimo Moratti and manager Marcello Lippi, who had requested the player after their successful season together at Juventus. Inter would be Vieri&#x27;s ninth club in his ninth season of being a professional footballer, and the only one where he would play for more than one season, for a total of six.

At Inter, Vieri formed a potentially dangerous partnership with Ronaldo up front, but because of injuries to both players, they were not able to play together often. He was impressive in his first couple of seasons, but constant managerial changes meant that Inter could not challenge for the &quot;Scudetto&quot;. It was under disciplined Argentinian coach Héctor Cúper, that Vieri and Inter really began to flourish and challenge for honours. Vieri was made the focal point of the attack and scored 22 goals in 25 games in the 2001–02 season as Inter narrowly missed out on the title after their last-day defeat to Lazio. The following season, he was Serie A &quot;Capocannoniere&quot; after scoring 24 goals in 23 appearances. In addition, he scored three goals in Inter&#x27;s Champions League campaign and formed a potent partnership with Hernán Crespo. He scored both of Inter&#x27;s goals in the quarter-final victory over Valencia. Vieri was injured during the second leg of this game and therefore played no part in the semi-final defeat to city rivals AC Milan.

The following year, Cúper was sacked only a few games into the season and was replaced by Alberto Zaccheroni. Vieri did not get along with his new manager and also had many of the Inter fans turn on him after his dip in form. In addition, he had shown his discontent at the sale of strike partner Crespo to Chelsea. When Roberto Mancini replaced Zaccheroni in the summer of 2004, Vieri played the majority games upfront with Adriano. It was clear to many though that the injury he had sustained against Valencia had taken its toll on Vieri and he was no longer as sharp in front of goal, despite his respectable goal output. On 6 January 2004, he scored his 100th goal for the club in a 3–1 home against Lecce, being celebrated by his teammates with a crown.

===Later career===
In July 2005, Vieri and Inter came to a mutual agreement to terminate his contract with the club. He was then signed by cross-town rivals AC Milan on a two-year deal, amidst interest from Newcastle United. He scored his only goal for them on 26 October to wrap up a 3–1 win at Empoli. Due to his poor performances throughout the season, he won the Bidone d&#x27;Oro Award in 2005, which is given to the worst Serie A player during a particular season.

In January 2006, he moved on a free transfer to Monaco, on a two-and-a-half-year deal, being brought in by compatriot manager Francesco Guidolin who had also loaned an Italian strike partner in the form of Marco Di Vaio. On 26 March, he suffered a knee injury through a collision with Paris Saint-Germain&#x27;s Bernard Mendy, which eventually ruled him out of a place in Italy&#x27;s squad that won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Vieri agreed a one-year deal with Sampdoria on 6 July 2006, however he returned to Atalanta on 29 August, signing a one-year minimum wage contract worth €1,500 per month. Although he received a paltry salary, Vieri was to earn another €100,000 for every goal he scored, leaving chairman Ivan Ruggeri to comment, &quot;If things go well, Vieri will cost me €2 million.&quot; Vieri scored two goals in seven substitute appearances, including one spectacular long-range effort.

In June 2007, Atalanta announced they would not offer a contract extension to Vieri. His contract therefore ended on 30 June. Vieri signed a one-year deal with Fiorentina in the summer of 2007 and he was officially presented to the press on 21 July 2007. He signed a one-year-contract for Atalanta on 30 June 2008; however, in early April, both Atalanta and Vieri mutually agreed that the contract was to be rescinded after only making nine appearances for the club. He announced his retirement from professional football on 20 October 2009.

==International career==
Vieri scored 23 goals in 49 matches for Italy between 1997 and 2005. He played for his country at the 1998 World Cup, scoring five times, and the 2002 World Cup, scoring four times. He endured a less successful tournament at Euro 2004, whilst he missed Euro 2000 and 2006 World Cup through injury. Vieri is generally considered to be Italy&#x27;s greatest pure striker of recent times, despite strong competition, and is one of Italy&#x27;s most prolific World Cup goal scorers. Appearing in a total of nine World Cup games in 1998 and 2002, he found the net nine times, making him one of the most feared strikers in those tournaments along with Ronaldo and Miroslav Klose, and Italy&#x27;s joint-highest World Cup goalscorer, alongside Roberto Baggio and Paolo Rossi. He was named by Pelé as one of the 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004. Alongside Francesco Graziani, he is Italy&#x27;s ninth-highest goalscorer of all time.

Vieri received his first international cap during the 1996–97 season after some impressive displays for Juventus; he made his Italy senior debut on 29 March 1997, at the age of 23, in a 3–0 win over Moldova, in which he also scored his first international goal, which was also the 1000th goal scored by the Italy national team. He scored a key goal for Italy in a 1–1 draw in the away leg of the team&#x27;s play off against Russia during their qualification campaign for the 1998 World Cup. At the finals of the tournament in France he formed a strong partnership with Roberto Baggio. Vieri opened the scoring against Chile after an assist from his strike partner. He went on to score three more goals during the group stage: two against Cameroon, and one against Austria. Vieri scored Italy&#x27;s only goal in the round of 16 match against Norway. He scored Italy&#x27;s fourth penalty in the quarter-final shootout against hosts and eventual champions France, but Luigi Di Biagio missed the fifth spot-kick, and Italy were eliminated. The aforementioned quarter-final showdown against France, which had ended in a 0–0 draw following extra time, was the only game of the tournament in which Vieri was unable to score.

Vieri missed out Dino Zoff&#x27;s squad for Euro 2000 after suffering a recurrence of an old thigh injury, following a collision with Gianluigi Buffon during the Serie A fourth place playoff for the final Champions League spot with Inter, against Parma, at the end of the 1999–2000 season; Buffon would later also miss out on the tournament through injury.

Italy played Vieri as a lone striker in the 2002 World Cup under manager Giovanni Trapattoni, scoring an impressive four goals in four games. He managed a brace in the opening game against Ecuador, and scored Italy&#x27;s only goal in the 2–1 defeat to Croatia despite having a previous goal incorrectly ruled out for offside. In the round of 16 match against co-hosts South Korea, he opened the scoring in the 18th minute, scoring a powerful header from a Francesco Totti corner. Italy led the game until the Koreans equalised two minutes before the end. Just one minute after the Korean equaliser, Vieri missed an open goal which would have put Italy in front. Italy were eventually eliminated by South Korea by a golden goal. The only game in which he failed to find the net was against Mexico in a 1–1 draw.

Vieri was once again the main striker in Italy&#x27;s ill-fated Euro 2004 campaign. This time he did not fare so well, however, scoring no goals as Italy were eliminated in the first round. It was during this tournament that his now infamous &quot;more of a man&quot; press conference took place following Italy&#x27;s 1–1 draw against Sweden, where he hit back at his critics in the Italian press by insulting them, and stated that he was &quot;more of a man&quot; than any of them, and accused them of publishing false news stories, after a rumour concerning a supposed quarrel between Vieri and his teammate Gianluigi Buffon had been leaked in the press. It is worth noting that Euro 2004 occurred at a particularly painful period of Vieri&#x27;s life, when he was being spied upon by his own club Inter and Telecom Italia at the request of club owner Massimo Moratti. In September 2012, Inter and Telecom Italia were ordered by a Milan court to pay Vieri damages amounting to €1 million for this case of phone tapping.

More disappointment occurred when he missed the 2006 World Cup after suffering a knee meniscus injury in a Ligue 1 match with Monaco against Paris Saint-Germain on 26 March 2006. Although Vieri would not necessarily have been a starter for Marcello Lippi&#x27;s side, Lippi admitted that he would have picked him had he been fit, and even encouraged him to move to France in order to gain more playing time ahead of the tournament. He played in three tournaments, but failed to win a medal in each of them, missing out on the Euro 2000 runners-up medal and the 2006 World Cup winners medal due to injury. His final appearance for Italy had come against Moldova, the team against which he had also made his debut, on 12 October 2005, under Lippi; he marked the occasion by scoring his final international goal in the 2–1 home win.

==Style of play==
Vieri was a complete, prolific and opportunistic striker, with a keen eye for goal. Due to his notable goal-scoring prowess, Vieri is regarded by pundits as one of the greatest Italian strikers of all time and one of the top strikers of his generation. Although he was considered to be more of a physical rather than talented player in his youth, who lacked strong technical ability, he was able to refine his touch on the ball in training as his career progressed, showing significant improvements to his technique. In his prime, his unique and direct offensive style of play, which blended power with pace and solid technical skills, led him to be compared to Luigi Riva and Roberto Boninsegna, as well as earning him the nickname of &quot;Il Toro&quot; (&quot;The Bull&quot;). Despite his goalscoring ability, he was also injury prone throughout his career, however, which greatly affected his pace, fitness and mobility in later years. Vieri was predominantly left-footed, although he was capable of scoring with both feet, as well as with his head, and from volleys. He has often been described as a large, old fashioned centre forward, due to his powerful physical presence and outstanding aerial ability; he is the all-time top scorer of headed goals in Italian league history. He also excelled at finding space to anticipate opponents and get on the end of passes. Despite being primarily a goal-scoring striker, he was also capable of providing assists to teammates, which was aided by his ability to use his strength to hold up the ball and play with his back to goal in order to participate in the build-up of attacking plays; he also excelled at beating the offside trap to get on the end of long balls with his runs in behind the defence, which also allowed him to provide depth to his team. Although he was primarily a goal-area threat, Vieri had an accurate and powerful shot from distance as well as inside the area; he was also an accurate penalty taker.

==Personal life==
Vieri&#x27;s personal life has been subject to much media attention in Italy. He has been involved in many high-profile relationships, including those with models Elisabetta Canalis, Elena Santarelli, Debora Salvalaggio, Fernanda Lessa, Melissa Satta and Jazzma Kendrick, among others.

Vieri has his own fashion label – Sweet Years – which he runs with friend and former Italy and AC Milan teammate Paolo Maldini. The pair also own a number of restaurants in the city of Milan. Another close friend of his is former forward Alessandro Matri, with whom he has been seen holidaying in Spain, along with other friends. He also started another clothing brand (Baci &amp; Abbracci) with close friend and footballer Cristian Brocchi and model Alena Šeredová.

Vieri presented a footvolley cup with the name &quot;Bobo summer cup&quot;, in 2018.

In 2017, Vieri began a relationship with Italian showgirl Costanza Caracciolo. On 18 November 2018, Vieri and Caracciolo announced the birth of their daughter Stella on Instagram. On 18 March 2019, the pair were married in a small civil ceremony at Villa Litta Modignani in the Affori ward of Milan. Toward the end of October that year, the couple announced that they were expecting a second child.

==Media==
Vieri features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover for the Italian edition of &quot;FIFA 99&quot;, and was named in the Ultimate Team Legends in &quot;FIFA 14&quot;.

Vieri featured as Ivan Drago in the 2000 Italian film, &quot;Picasso&#x27;s face&quot;.

In December 2003, Vieri participated in the Italian TV broadcast &quot;Chi vuol essere milionario?&quot; forming a memorable duo with Gennaro Gattuso during an episode organised for charity purposes. Vieri and Gattuso answered 13 questions in a row correctly, retiring after reading the second-to-last question, winning an outstanding amount of €150,000. The thirteenth question represented a dramatic yet hilarious moment on Italian television: being the duo doubtful about the correct answer, Vincenzo Montella, one of the football players who were in the audience, invited Vieri and Gattuso to walk away with the already collected amount of €70,000 without risking to reduce the final prize to €16,000 answering incorrectly. Vieri playfully suggested selling the player (&quot;Ma vendetelo!&quot;), while Gattuso jokingly asked for getting Montella out of the studio as he was behaving like a jinx (&quot;Porta una sfiga Montella, mandatelo via!&quot;).

Having retired from professional football, Vieri started working as a pundit and consultant for beIN Sports. He successively started his weekly Twitch-based podcast, named &quot;Bobo TV&quot;, together with former teammates Antonio Cassano, Daniele Adani and Nicola Ventola, which quickly became one of the most popular Web-based shows in Italy.

<text>These are the [[Billboard Hot 100|&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100]] number-one hits of 1977.

That year, 18 acts earned their first number one songs, such as Leo Sayer, Rose Royce, Mary MacGregor, Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band, Daryl Hall and John Oates, ABBA, David Soul, Thelma Houston, Fleetwood Mac, Bill Conti, Alan O&#x27;Day, Shaun Cassidy, Andy Gibb, The Emotions, Meco, and Debby Boone. Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr., already having hit number one with The 5th Dimension, also earn their first number one song as solo acts. Leo Sayer, Stevie Wonder and The Eagles were the only acts to hit number one more than once with each having two songs.

== Chart history ==

An asterisk (*) by a date indicates an unpublished, &quot;frozen&quot; week, due to the special double issues that &quot;Billboard&quot; published in print at the end of the year for their year-end charts. This began at the end of 1976, though charts would be published during the frozen week from the early 1990s onward, when &quot;Billboard&quot; made their charts available electronically or online.

<text>These are the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles of 1980. The two longest running number-one singles of 1980 are &quot;Call Me&quot; by Blondie and &quot;Lady&quot; by Kenny Rogers with each single obtaining six weeks on top of the chart. Every song that went to number one for 1980 stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 over 20 weeks.

That year, six acts hit number one for the first time, such as Queen, Pink Floyd, Lipps Inc., Billy Joel, Christopher Cross, and Kenny Rogers. John Lennon was the fourth artist to hit number one posthumously, after his death in December 1980.

The British rock band Queen was the only act to achieve multiple number-one songs during the year with &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;.

<text>These are the [[Billboard Hot 100|&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100]] number-one hits of 1981. The longest running number-one single of 1981 is &quot;Physical&quot; by Olivia Newton-John which stayed at the top of the chart for six weeks in 1981 and then for four additional weeks in 1982, with a total of 10 weeks at number-one. This also makes &quot;Physical&quot; the longest running number-one single of the 1980s.

That year, 10 acts hit number one for the first time, such as Kool &amp; the Gang, Dolly Parton, Eddie Rabbitt, REO Speedwagon, Sheena Easton, Kim Carnes, Stars on 45, Air Supply, and Rick Springfield. Lionel Richie, already having hit number one with The Commodores, also receives his first number one song as a solo act. Blondie and Daryl Hall and John Oates were the only acts to hit number one more than once, with both acts hitting twice.

<text>This is a list of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number-one singles of 1986. The longest running number-one singles of 1986 are &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot; by Dionne and Friends and &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; by The Bangles, which each logged four weeks at number-one. &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; logged two weeks at number-one in 1986 and two more weeks at number-one in 1987, summing up to four weeks at the top. &quot;Say You, Say Me&quot; by Lionel Richie concluded another four week run that began in 1985. 1986 is the year with the third largest number of number-one songs, with 30 songs reaching the #1 spot.

That year, 20 acts earned their first number one song, such as Heart, Falco, Robert Palmer, Pet Shop Boys, Simply Red, Genesis, Peter Gabriel, Steve Winwood, Bananarama, Berlin, Janet Jackson, Boston, Bon Jovi, Amy Grant, Bruce Hornsby &amp; the Range, and The Bangles. Gladys Knight, Patti LaBelle, Michael McDonald, and Peter Cetera, already having hit number one with Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, Labelle, The Doobie Brothers, and Chicago, respectively, also earn their first number one songs as solo acts. Whitney Houston, Madonna, and Peter Cetera were the only acts to earn more than one number one song, with each of them hitting the top twice.

<text>These are the &quot;Billboard magazine&quot; [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] number one hits of 1988. The &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 is a chart that ranks the best-performing singles of the United States. Published by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the data are based collectively on each single&#x27;s weekly physical sales, and airplay. R&amp;B/pop megastar Whitney Houston&#x27;s two singles released from her second studio album &quot;Whitney&quot;, &quot;So Emotional&quot; and &quot;Where Do Broken Hearts Go&quot;, both peaked at number one, which gave her a total of seven consecutive number one hits, breaking the record of six previously shared by The Beatles and The Bee Gees. The longest running number-one single of 1988 was &quot;Roll With It&quot; by Steve Winwood, which obtained four weeks at the top of the chart. When &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; reached number-one on the chart, it became Michael Jackson&#x27;s fifth single from the album &quot;Bad&quot; to reach number-one. Jackson became the first artist to have five singles from one album reach number-one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and is the only male to do so. George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; was the best selling single of 1988 in the United States, despite most of its weeks at number one occurring in December 1987. (It carried over into 1988 at number one as the result of a frozen chart.) 1988 is tied with 1989 for the second most #1 hits with 32 songs going to number one.

That year, 17 acts earned their first number one song, such as INXS, Exposé, Rick Astley, Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby, Gloria Estefan, Miami Sound Machine, Debbie Gibson, Cheap Trick, Richard Marx, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Bobby McFerrin, Def Leppard, UB40, The Escape Club, Will to Power and Poison. George Michael, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, and Rick Astley were the only acts to hit number one more than once, with George Michael having the most with four, Michael Jackson with three, and Whitney Houston and Rick Astley with two.

<text>James Wright Gordon (1809 – December 1853), usually referred to as J. Wright Gordon, was a Whig politician from the U.S. state of Michigan.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
Gordon was born in Plainfield, Connecticut and studied law at Harvard University. He was a descendant of Edmond Gordon, the immigrant, who arrived from England in 1635 as part of the Puritan migration to New England.

He later moved to Michigan, establishing a practice in Marshall, and also lived for a time in Battle Creek. He was a member of the Michigan State Senate (6th district) in 1839 and served as the second lieutenant governor of Michigan from 1840 to 1841.

Gordon became the third governor of Michigan &quot;ex officio&quot;, when William Woodbridge resigned on February 23, 1841, to become a U.S. Senator. He completed the remainder of Woodbridge&#x27;s term until January 3, 1842.

He ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Representative from Michigan&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in 1846 and 1847, defeated by John Smith Chipman.

==Death in Brazil==
Gordon was the U.S. Consul in Pernambuco, Brazil, from 1850 to 1853 and died at the age of 44 while in office, when he accidentally fell to his death from a second-story balcony. He is buried in Brazil.

<text>The Combat of the Thirty (, ), occurring on 26 March 1351, was an episode in the Breton War of Succession fought to determine who would rule the Duchy of Brittany. It was an arranged fight between selected combatants from both sides of the conflict, fought at a site midway between the Breton castles of Josselin and Ploërmel among 30 champions, knights, and squires on each side. The challenge was issued by Jean de Beaumanoir, a captain of Charles of Blois supported by King Philip VI of France, to Robert Bemborough, a captain of Jean de Montfort supported by Edward III of England.

After a hard-fought battle, the Franco-Breton Blois faction emerged victorious. The combat was later celebrated by medieval chroniclers and balladeers as a noble display of the ideals of chivalry. In the words of Jean Froissart, the warriors &quot;held themselves as valiantly on both sides as if they had been all Rolands and Olivers&quot;.

==Background and cause==
The Breton War of Succession was a struggle between the House of Montfort and House of Blois for control of the Duchy of Brittany. It came to be absorbed into the larger Hundred Years&#x27; War between France and England, with England supporting the Montforts and France supporting the Blois family. At the time of the tournament, the war had become stalemated, with each faction controlling strongholds at different locations within Brittany, but occasionally making sorties into one another&#x27;s territory.

Robert Bemborough, a knight leading the Montfortist faction which controlled Ploërmel, was challenged to single combat by Jean de Beaumanoir, the captain of nearby Josselin, controlled by the Blois faction. According to the chronicler Froissart, this purely personal duel between the two leaders became a larger struggle when Bemborough suggested a tournament between twenty or thirty knights on each side, a proposal that was enthusiastically accepted by de Beaumanoir.

The motivation for the tournament is unclear. The earliest written sources present it as a purely chivalric exercise, undertaken to honour the ladies for whom the knights were fighting: referring to Joan of Penthièvre (House of Blois) and Joan of Flanders (House of Montfort). These women were leading the two factions at the time, as Joan&#x27;s husband was in captivity and Joanna&#x27;s was dead (her son was a young child at the time). This is the account given by the contemporary chroniclers Jean le Bel and Jean Froissart, both of whom present the conflict as purely a matter of honour with no personal animosity involved. Le Bel states that he had his information from one of the combatants. Froissart appears to simply copy le Bel&#x27;s version.

However, popular ballads portrayed the cause differently. The earliest of these, written by an unknown local supporter of the Blois faction, depicts Bemborough and his knights as ruthless despoilers of the local population, who appealed to Beaumanoir for help. Beaumanoir is depicted as a hero coming to the aid of the defenceless people. The poet also portrays Beaumanoir as a model of Christian piety, who puts his faith in God, in contrast to Bemborough who relies on the Prophesies of Merlin. This version was standardised in Pierre Le Baud&#x27;s &quot;History of the Bretons&quot;, written a century later, in which Bemborough&#x27;s alleged cruelty is explained by his desire to avenge the death of Thomas Dagworth.

Whatever the cause, the fight was arranged in the form of an &quot;emprise&quot;—an arranged pas d&#x27;armes—which took place at an area known as the &quot;chêne de Mi-Voie&quot; (the Halfway Oak) between Ploërmel and Josselin, between picked combatants. It was organised in the manner of a tournament, with refreshments on hand and a large gathering of spectators. Bemborough is supposed to have said,

And let us right there try ourselves and do so much that people will speak of it in future times in halls, in palaces, in public places and elsewhere throughout the world.
The words are recorded by Froissart: &quot;the saying may not be authentic&quot;, Johan Huizinga remarks, &quot;but it teaches us what Froissart thought&quot;.

Beaumanoir commanded thirty Bretons, Bemborough a mixed force of twenty Englishmen (including Robert Knolles and Hugh Calveley), six German mercenaries and four Breton partisans of Montfort. It is unclear whether Bemborough himself was English or German. His name is spelled in many variant forms, and is given as &quot;Brandebourch&quot; by Froissart, and also appears as &quot;Bembro&quot;. His first name is sometimes given as Robert, sometimes as Richard. Both Le Bel and Froissart say he was a German knight, but historians have doubted this. All the Blois-faction knights can be identified, though Jean de Beaumanoir&#x27;s given name is &quot;Robert&quot; in some versions. The names and identities of the Montfortists are much more confused and uncertain.

==Battle==
The battle, fought with swords, daggers, spears, and axes, mounted or on foot, was of the most desperate character, in its details very reminiscent of the last fight of the Burgundians in the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;, especially in the celebrated advice of Geoffroy du Bois to his wounded leader, who was asking for water: &quot;Drink thy blood, Beaumanoir; thy thirst will pass&quot; (&quot;Bois ton sang, Beaumanoir, la soif te passera&quot;).

According to Froissart, the battle was fought with great gallantry on both sides. After several hours of fighting there were four dead on the French side and two on the English side. Both sides were exhausted and agreed to a break for refreshments and bandaging of injuries. After the battle resumed, the English leader Bemborough was wounded and then killed, apparently by du Bois. At this point the English faction formed a tight defensive body, which the French repeatedly attacked. A German soldier called Croquart is said to have displayed the greatest prowess in rallying the Anglo-Breton defence.

In the end, the victory was decided by Guillaume de Montauban, a squire who mounted his horse and rode into the English line, breaking it. He overthrew seven of the English champions, the rest being forced to surrender. All the combatants on either side were either dead or seriously wounded, with nine on the English side slain.

==Reputation==

While the combat did not have any effect on the outcome of the Breton war of succession, it was considered by contemporaries to be an example of the finest chivalry. It was sung by trouvères, retold in the chronicles of Froissart and largely admired, and honoured in verse and the visual arts. A commemorative stone was placed at the site of the combat situated between Josselin and Ploermel and King Charles V of France commissioned a tapestry depicting it. The renown attached to those who participated was such that twenty years later, Jean Froissart noticed a scarred survivor, Yves Charruel, at the table of Charles V, where he was honoured above all others due to having been one of the Thirty.

According to historian Steven Muhlberger, this chivalric version concentrates on &quot;how the deed was done and not on who won. The willingness of all concerned to agree to rules and to actually observe them, to fight their best and not to run when injured or in danger of capture are the focus – and both sides are shown as equally worthy in that respect.&quot;

Later, the combat came to be seen in very different terms, influenced by the most famous of the contemporary popular ballads on the topic. In this version the English knights are villains, and the Blois faction are loyal and worthy local warriors. The balladeer lists each fighter on both sides (though garbles several English names). He situates the Franco-Breton Blois faction as all local gentry and aristocracy performing their proper social duty to protect the people, thus justifying, Muhlberger writes, &quot;the privileges that nobles held as brave defenders of the weak&quot;. The Montfortists are a mélange of foreign mercenaries and brigands who &quot;torment the poor people&quot;. After Brittany was absorbed into France, this version was incorporated into French nationalist accounts of the Hundred Years War, which was portrayed as a heroic struggle against foreign invaders who sought to violate France. Since the French faction had lost the War of Succession itself, the Combat was promoted as a symbolic and moral victory. A large monumental obelisk was commissioned by Napoleon in 1811 to be placed at the site of the battle, but it was not built during his reign. It was eventually erected in 1819 by the restored Bourbon king Louis XVIII, after the fall of Napoleon, with an inscription stating &quot;God give the King long life, the Bourbons eternity!&quot; The inscription goes on to assert that the &quot;thirty Bretons whose names are given as follows, fought to defend the poor, labourers and craftsmen and they vanquished foreigners attracted on the soil of the Country by fateful dissents. Breton posterity, imitate your ancestors!&quot;

Though the combat had much less significance for the English, the fact that it was won because one combatant mounted a horse to break the Anglo-Breton line was later portrayed as evidence that the Franco-Bretons cheated. Edward Smedley&#x27;s &quot;History of France&quot; (1836) states that the manoeuvre &quot;wears some appearance of treachery&quot;. This version was fictionalised by Arthur Conan Doyle in his historical novel &quot;Sir Nigel&quot;, in which Bemborough (called Richard of Bambro&#x27; in the novel) accepts the rules of the challenge in a chivalric spirit, but the Franco-Bretons win only because Montauban, portrayed as Beaumanoir&#x27;s squire, mounts his horse, when the conflict was supposed to be on foot, and rides upon the English, trampling them.

A free English translation in verse of the ballad was written by Harrison Ainsworth, who gives the name of the English leader as &quot;Sir Robert Pembroke&quot;. He is fancifully portrayed as the overall English leader after the death of Thomas Dagworth. Ainsworth argued that &quot;Bembro&quot; was originally &quot;Pembroke&quot; on the grounds that the Breton language version of the name was &quot;Pennbrock&quot;. &quot;Penn brock&quot; means &quot;badger head&quot; in Breton, which had become a derogatory nickname for Bemborough in Breton ballads.

==Combatants==
These are the names of the knights, as listed in Ainsworth&#x27;s translation of the poem, although there are actually 31 listed for the English side.

† &quot;indicates that the combatant was killed. The English side lost nine killed in total and the remainder captured. The Franco-Breton side lost at least three and probably more. A number of them were captured, taken to Josselin and executed.&quot;

<doc id="615907" wikidata="Q262665" url="?curid=615907" title="Mallika Sherawat">
<text>Reema Lamba (born 24 October 1976), better known as Mallika Sherawat, is an Indian actress who predominantly works in Hindi language films. Known for her bold onscreen portrayal in films like &quot;Khwahish&quot; (2003) and &quot;Murder&quot; (2004), Sherawat has established herself as a sex symbol in Bollywood. She is also known for appearing in several popular item numbers. 

Sherawat&#x27;s role in the romantic comedy &quot;Pyaar Ke Side Effects&quot; (2006) was well-received. She subsequently starred in &quot;Aap Ka Suroor&quot;, &quot;Welcome&quot; (both 2007), &quot;Dasavathaaram&quot; (2008) — her biggest commercial success so far — and &quot;Double Dhamaal&quot; (2011). Apart from Indian films, she has appeared in the Chinese films &quot;The Myth &quot; (2005) and &quot;Time Raiders&quot; (2016). She was one of the few Bollywood stars trying to cross over to Hollywood, with films like &quot;Hisss&quot; (2010) and &quot;Politics of Love&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
Sherawat was born as Reema Lamba in Moth, a small village in Hisar district of Haryana to a Jat family. Mallika&#x27;s father is Mukesh Kumar Lamba and she was born in the family of Seth Chhaju Ram, a leading Jat philanthropist. She adopted the screen name of &quot;Mallika&quot;, meaning &quot;empress&quot;, to avoid confusion with other actresses named Reema. &quot;Sherawat&quot; is her mother&#x27;s maiden name. She has stated that she uses her mother&#x27;s maiden name because of the support that her mother has provided her. Although relations with her family were strained when she entered the film industry, Sherawat&#x27;s family has now accepted her career choice and they have reconciled.

Sherawat went to Delhi Public School, Mathura Road. She has a degree in philosophy from Miranda House, Delhi University. During the initial days of her career, she claimed to be from a very conservative small-town family and that she faced many hurdles from them in pursuing her career. However, Sherawat&#x27;s family has rebutted this as a story created by her to give her an aura of a rustic girl who made it big in Bollywood.

==Career==
Before entering films, Sherawat appeared in television commercials with Amitabh Bachchan for BPL and Shah Rukh Khan for Hyundai Santro. She also appeared in Nirmal Pandey&#x27;s &quot;Maar Dala&quot; and Surjit Bindrakhia&#x27;s &quot;Lak Tunoo&quot; music video. She debuted in films with a small rôle in &quot;Jeena Sirf Merre Liye&quot; where she was credited as Reema Lamba.

Sherawat attracted notice with her appearance in the 2003 film, &quot;Khwahish&quot;. In 2004, she starred in &quot;Murder&quot;, a film inspired by Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;Unfaithful&quot;. She was noticed for her bold role with critic Narbir Gosal writing, &quot;she has the chops to pull off a role like this one. She´s confident and sexy as Simran and handles her emotional scenes with dignity.&quot; She received a nomination for &#x27;Best Actress&#x27; at the Zee Cine Awards for her performance in &quot;Murder&quot;. The film went on to become one of the biggest hits of the year.

Since then, Sherawat has been known for expressing her opinions in public, as well for the reaction to some of her statements.
In 2005, Sherawat acted in &quot;The Myth&quot;, a Chinese film, co-starring with Jackie Chan. She played an Indian girl who saves Chan&#x27;s character from a river. &quot;The Myth&quot; was her first international film. Her appearance at the Cannes Film Festival to promote the film secured a lot of attention, with &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Richard Corliss calling her &quot;the next big thing.&quot;

Her performance in the 2006 film &quot;Pyaar Ke Side Effects&quot;, co-starring Rahul Bose, won her praise from around the industry, with critic Raja Sen commenting, &quot;Mallika steals the show with her disarming candour.&quot; and the film did moderately well at the box office.

Her first release in 2007 was Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Guru&quot;, in which she performed the song &quot;Mayya Mayya.&quot; She played a guest role in Himesh Reshammiya&#x27;s &quot;Aap Ka Suroor - The Real Love Story&quot; and reportedly charged Rs. 15 million for a 10-minute appearance. Her last release of 2007 was &quot;Welcome&quot;, which did exceptionally well at the box office. Her performance received very favourable reviews with noted film critic Taran Adarsh writing, &quot;Mallika Sherawat is electrifying.&quot;

Her 2008 releases were &quot;Ugly Aur Pagli&quot; and &quot;Maan Gaye Mughal-e-Azam&quot;. Both were unsuccessful at the box office. Sherawat&#x27;s next Bollywood release was &quot;Double Dhamaal&quot;, which went on to becoming a moderate success at the box office, receiving &#x27;above average&#x27; status at the box office, by Box Office India. She also appeared in item numbers in films such as &quot;Thank You&quot; (Razia Gundon Mein Phas Gayi), &quot;Bin Bulaye Baraati&quot; (Shalu Ke Thumkey) and in &quot;Osthe&quot; (Kalasala), which is a Tamil film. In 2012, she was featured in an item number in &quot;Tezz&quot; (Laila). Sherawat has also performed in &quot;Kismat Love Paisa Dilli&quot;, in which she will be playing a Haryanvi.

On 23 October 2013 Mallika staring reality dating show called &quot;Bachelorette India - Mere Khayalon ki Mallika&quot; was aired which was adopted from &quot;The Bachelorette&quot; to find the perfect bachelor for herself.
In 2009, Sherawat starred in a Hollywood film named &quot;Hisss&quot;, co-starring Irrfan Khan and directed by Jennifer Lynch. The story, based on the legend of Nāga, is an independent co-production between the United States and India. Endeavour Independent bought the distribution rights of &quot;Hisss&quot;. Sherawat promoted it with live snakes at the Cannes Film Festival 2010. &quot;Hisss&quot; was released in all major Indian languages on 22 October 2010. 

Sherawat starred in another Hollywood film, &quot;Politics of Love&quot;, aka &quot;Love, Barack&quot;, directed by William Dear. She plays Aretha Gupta, a devoted local Obama volunteer coordinator. The film is a romantic comedy set during Barack Obama&#x27;s campaign for the US presidency. A first look of &quot;Love, Barack&quot; was unveiled by Sherawat at Cannes 2010. It was released in 2011.

Sherawat won the 2008 Renaissance Artist Award at the 16th Annual Diversity Awards held in California. On 14 August 2009, Sherawat received honorary citizenship of Los Angeles in recognition of her career achievements and charitable work.

In 2012 Sherawat featured with American pop star Bruno Mars in his parody video of Salt-n-Pepa&#x27;s &quot;Whatta Man&quot; for the comedy website Funny or Die.

== Personal life ==
During her brief stint as an air hostess, Sherawat married Delhi-based pilot Karan Singh Gill in 1997. She later divorced him. She kept her marriage a secret as the stigma of divorce would&#x27;ve prevented her rise in Bollywood. She dated French real estate agent Cyrille Auxenfans in 2017.

Sherawat is a vegan.

==Activism==
Sherawat has been involved with women&#x27;s rights activism, discussing women&#x27;s issues at the 65th United Nations DPI/NGO Conference in 2014. During the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, Sherawat had herself locked in a cage for twelve hours to support the Free A Girl India NGO.

<doc id="615913" wikidata="Q282208" url="?curid=615913" title="EURion constellation">
<text>The EURion constellation (also known as Omron rings or doughnuts) is a pattern of symbols incorporated into a number of secure documents such as banknotes, cheques, and ownership title certificate designs worldwide since about 1996. It is added to help imaging software detect the presence of such a document in a digital image. Such software can then block the user from reproducing such documents to prevent counterfeiting using colour photocopiers.

== Description ==

The name EURion constellation was coined by security researcher Markus Kuhn, who uncovered the pattern on the 10-euro banknote in early 2002 while experimenting with a Xerox colour photocopier that refused to reproduce banknotes. The pattern has never been mentioned officially; Kuhn named it the &quot;EURion constellation&quot; as it resembled the astronomical Orion constellation, and EUR is the ISO 4217 designation of the euro currency.

The EURion constellation first described by Kuhn consists of a pattern of five small yellow, green or orange circles, which is repeated across areas of the banknote at different orientations. The mere presence of five of these circles on a page is sufficient for some colour photocopiers to refuse processing.

Some banks integrate the constellation tightly with the remaining design of the note. On 50 DM German banknotes, the EURion circles formed the innermost circles in a background pattern of fine concentric circles. On the front of former Bank of England Elgar £20 notes, they appear as green heads of musical notes; however, on the Smith £20 notes of 2007 the circles merely cluster around the &quot;£20&quot; text. On some U.S. bills, they appear as the digit zero in small, yellow numbers matching the value of the note. On Japanese yen, these circles sometimes appear as flowers.

Technical details regarding the EURion constellation are kept secret by its inventors and users. A 1995 patent application suggests that the pattern and detection algorithm were designed at Omron, a Japanese electronics company. It is also not clear whether the feature has any official name. The term &quot;Omron anti-photocopying feature&quot; appeared in an August 2005 press release by the Reserve Bank of India. In 2007, the term &quot;Omron rings&quot; was used in an award announcement by a banknote collectors society.

== Usage ==
The following table lists some banknotes on which the EURion constellation or Omron rings have been found. Current currencies for which all recent banknotes use the constellation are in bold and whose central banks are members of the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group are &quot;italicised&quot;.

The members of Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG) are the European Central Bank and the central banks of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

== Other banknote detection mechanisms ==

=== Counterfeit Deterrence System ===

Since 2003, image editors such as Adobe Photoshop CS or PaintShop Pro 8 refuse to print banknotes. According to Wired.com, the banknote detection code in these applications, called the Counterfeit Deterrence System (CDS), was designed by the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group and supplied to companies such as Adobe as a binary module. Experiments by Steven J. Murdoch and others showed that this banknote detection code does not rely on the EURion pattern. It instead detects a digital watermark embedded in the images, developed by Digimarc.

<text>Cannon fodder is an informal, derogatory term for combatants who are regarded or treated by government or military command as in the face of enemy fire. The term is generally used in situations where combatants are forced to fight against hopeless odds (with the foreknowledge that they will suffer extremely high casualties) in an effort to achieve a strategic goal; an example is the trench warfare of World War I. The term may also be used (somewhat pejoratively) to differentiate infantry from other forces (such as artillery troops, air force or the navy), or to distinguish expendable low-grade or inexperienced combatants from more militarily valuable veterans.

The term derives from fodder, as food for livestock. Soldiers are the metaphorical food for enemy cannon fire.

==Etymology==
The concept of soldiers as fodder, as nothing more than &quot;food&quot; to be consumed by battle, dates back to at least the 16th century. For example, in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; there is a scene where Prince Henry ridicules John Falstaff&#x27;s pitiful group of soldiers. Falstaff replies to Prince Henry with cynical references to gunpowder and tossing bodies into mass grave pits, saying that his men are &quot;good enough to toss; food for powder, food for powder; they&#x27;ll fill a pit as well as better [men]...&quot;

The first attested use of the expression &quot;cannon fodder&quot; is by a French writer, François-René de Chateaubriand. In his anti-Napoleonic pamphlet &quot;De Bonaparte et des Bourbons&quot;, published in 1814, he criticized the cynical attitude towards recruits that prevailed in the end of Napoleon&#x27;s reign: &quot;On en était venu à ce point de mépris pour la vie des hommes et pour la France, d&#x27;appeler les conscrits la matière première et la chair à canon&quot;—&quot;the contempt for the lives of men and for France herself has come to the point of calling the conscripts &#x27;the raw material&#x27; and &#x27;the cannon fodder&#x27;.&quot; 

The term appeared in an English translation of a story written by Hendrik Conscience, translated by Mrs. Egwitt and published in the &quot;Janesville Gazette&quot;, Wisconsin in 1854. It later appeared in &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;, London in 1861 and was popularized during World War I.

==See also==
;Military tactics/units
* Forlorn hope: an initial wave of assault troops expected to sustain high casualties while attacking a well-defended target.
* Human shield: a situation in which the potential for civilian casualties deters attacks on a military target.
* Human wave attack: an assault in which a disproportionately large number of attackers is intended to overwhelm a well-defended target.
* Penal military unit: a combat formation composed of either personnel sentenced under military law, or civilian convicts who have volunteered or been drafted into military service.
* Shock troops: infantry at the forefront of an attack.
* Suicide attack: an attack in which the self-actuated death of the attacker serves to inflict enemy casualties as well (bombing, Kamikaze etc.).

;Other cultural analogs
* Charge of the Light Brigade, where soldiers fought bravely despite facing a near certain death.
* The play &quot;Oh, What a Lovely War!&quot;, devised by Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop, and in particular the dialogue given to Douglas Haig, is centred on this theme.

<text>Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is an edition of Microsoft&#x27;s Windows XP operating system that supports the x86-64 architecture. It was released on April 25, 2005, alongside the x86-64 versions of Windows Server 2003.

Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is designed to use the expanded 64-bit memory address space provided by the x86-64 64-bit extensions to the x86 IA-32 architecture, which was implemented by AMD as &quot;AMD64&quot;, found in AMD&#x27;s Opteron, Athlon 64 chips (and in selected Sempron processors), and implemented by Intel as &quot;Intel 64&quot; (formerly known as IA-32e and EM64T), found in some of Intel&#x27;s Pentium 4 and most of Intel&#x27;s later chips since the Core series.

Windows XP Professional x64 Edition uses the same kernel and code tree as Windows Server 2003 and is serviced by the same service packs. However, it includes client features of Windows XP such as System Restore, Windows Messenger, Fast User Switching, Welcome Screen, Security Center and games, of which Windows Server 2003 does not have.

During the initial development phases (2003–2004), Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was named &quot;Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for 64-Bit Extended Systems&quot; and later as &quot;Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for Extended Systems&quot;, as opposed to &quot;64-Bit Edition for Itanium Systems&quot; for Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, as the latter was designed for the IA-64 (Itanium) architecture.

== Features ==
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition offers a number of new and updated features not found in the main 32-bit x86 versions of Windows XP:

=== End-user ===
* Internet Information Services (IIS) version 6.0, the same version that was included in Windows Server 2003, is included with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. All other 32-bit editions of Windows XP have IIS v5.1.
* Windows Media Player version 10, the version that came with Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, is included with Windows XP Profesional x64 Edition. Windows XP Professional for x86 originally shipped with Windows Media Player version 8 from RTM to Service Pack 1 and later came with Windows Media Player 9 from Service Pack 2 onwards, with Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 receiving Windows Media Player 10. Windows Media Player 11 is available for x86 versions of Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later.
* Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) features and improvements made in Windows Server 2003 were included with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.
* Shadow Copy, a feature that automatically creates daily backups of files and folders, was first introduced in Windows Server 2003 and is available in Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.
* Remote Desktop Services supports Unicode keyboard input, client-side time-zone redirection, GDI+ rendering primitives for improved performance, FIPS encryption, fallback printer driver, auto-reconnect and new Group Policy settings.
* Files and Settings Transfer Wizard supports migrating settings from both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows XP PCs.

=== Core ===
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is based on the Windows Server 2003 kernel and codebase, which is newer than 32-bit Windows XP (by about two years) and has improvements to enhance scalability. It also introduces Kernel Patch Protection (also known as PatchGuard) to improve security by helping to eliminate rootkits.

== Advantages ==
The primary benefit of moving to 64-bit is the increase in the maximum allocatable random-access memory (RAM). 32-bit editions of Windows XP are limited to a total of 4 gigabytes. Although the theoretical memory limit of a 64-bit computer is about 16 exabytes (17.1 billion gigabytes), Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is limited to 128GB of physical memory and 16 terabytes of virtual memory.

Windows XP Professional x64 Edition also offers a number of benefits/advantages over the main 32-bit x86 versions of Windows XP:

* Supports up to two physical CPUs (in separate physical sockets) and up to 64 logical processors (i.e. cores or threads on a single CPU). Windows XP Professional for x86 supported up to two physical CPUs but is limited to a maximum of 32 logical processors.
* Supports GPT-partitioned disks for data volumes (but not bootable volumes) after SP1, which allows disks greater than 2TB to be used as a single GPT partition for storing data.
* Allows for faster encoding of audio or video, higher video game performance and faster 3D rendering than with 32-bit versions of Windows XP, in 64-bit optimized software.
* Immunity from certain types of viruses and malware targeted at 32-bit versions of Windows XP, as most system files are 64-bit.

== Disadvantages/limitations ==
There are some limitations which apply to Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:

* Only 64-bit drivers are supported.
* Any 32-bit Windows Explorer shell extensions fail to work with the 64-bit version of Windows Explorer, however Windows XP x64 Edition also ships with a 32-bit version of Windows Explorer. It is possible to make this as the default Windows Shell.
* No native support for Type 1 fonts.
* IEEE 1394 (FireWire) audio is not supported.
* Hibernation is not supported if the RAM is greater than 4GB. This would later be resolved by Windows 7.
* EFI and/or UEFI are not supported. A BIOS with Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) is required.
* English or Japanese are only provided as native display languages. Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish and Swedish are available as Multilingual User Interface (MUI) packs for the English version.
* Additionally, the extra registers of the x86-64 architecture can cause a slight decrease in performance with certain applications compared to the same application compiled in 32-bit only x86 code running on 32-bit versions of Windows XP.

== Software compatibility ==
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition uses a technology named Windows-on-Windows 64-bit (WoW64), which permits the execution of 32-bit software. It was first used in Windows XP 64-bit Edition (for Itanium architecture). Later, it was adopted for x64 editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

Since the x86-64 architecture includes hardware-level support for 32-bit instructions, WoW64 simply switches the process between 32- and 64-bit modes. As a result, x86-64 architecture microprocessors suffer no performance loss when executing 32-bit Windows applications. On the Itanium architecture, WoW64 was required to translate 32-bit x86 instructions into their 64-bit Itanium equivalents—which in some cases were implemented in quite different ways—so that the processor could execute them. All 32-bit processes are shown with *32 in the task manager, while 64-bit processes have no extra text present.

Although 32-bit applications can be run transparently, the mixing of the two types of code within the same process is not allowed. A 64-bit program cannot use a 32-bit dynamic-link library (DLL) and similarly a 32-bit program cannot use a 64-bit DLL. This may lead to the need for library developers to provide both 32-bit and 64-bit binary versions of their libraries. Specifically, 32-bit shell extensions for Windows Explorer fail to work with 64-bit Windows Explorer. Windows XP x64 Edition ships with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows Explorer. The 32-bit version can become the default Windows Shell. Windows XP x64 Edition also includes both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Internet Explorer 6, so that users can still use browser extensions or ActiveX controls that are not available in 64-bit versions.

Only 64-bit drivers are supported in Windows XP x64 Edition, but 32-bit codecs are supported as long as the media player that uses them is 32-bit.

=== Installation of programs ===
By default, 64-bit (x86-64) Windows programs are installed onto their own folders under codice_1, while 32-bit (x86/IA-32) Windows programs are installed onto their own folders under codice_2.

== Removed features ==
Some features are not included at all on Windows XP Professional x64 Edition. Most of them are inherited from Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (the version that Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is based on), which includes some changes from Windows XP Service Pack 2 for x86:

* NTVDM and Windows on Windows were removed, so 16-bit Windows applications or native MS-DOS applications cannot run. A similar case happened with all versions of Windows XP for Itanium. Some old 32-bit programs use 16-bit installers which do not run; however, replacements for 16-bit installers such as ACME Setup versions 2.6, 3.0, 3.01, 3.1 and InstallShield 5.x are hardcoded into WoW64 to mitigate this issue. This is true for later 64-bit versions of Windows. 
* COMMAND.COM, which is a command interpreter exclusive to MS-DOS and Windows 9x, is no longer included.
* Program Manager was removed and replaced with Windows Explorer. The executable is still present, but it was replaced with a compatibility stub that redirects to Explorer. The executable itself would not be removed entirely until Windows Vista.
* Win32 console programs (including Command Prompt) no longer loads in full-screen. This also applies to later versions of Windows.
* &quot;Media Bar&quot;, which replaced the &quot;Radio Toolbar&quot; in Internet Explorer 6, was removed.
* The Web Extender Client component for Web Folders (WebDAV) was not included.
* Spell checking in Outlook Express was removed.

== Service packs ==
The RTM version of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was built from the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 codebase. Because Windows XP Professional x64 Edition comes from a different codebase than 32-bit Windows XP, its service packs are also developed separately. For the same reason, Service Pack 2 for Windows XP x64 Edition, released on March 13, 2007, is not the same as Service Pack 2 for 32-bit versions of Windows XP. In fact, due to the earlier release date of the 32-bit version, many of the key features introduced by Service Pack 2 for 32-bit (x86) editions of Windows XP were already present in the RTM version of its x64 counterpart. Service Pack 2 is the last released service pack for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.

== Upgradeability ==
A machine running Windows XP Professional x64 Edition cannot be directly upgraded to Windows Vista because the 64-bit Vista DVD mistakenly recognizes XP x64 as a 32-bit system. Windows XP x64 does qualify the customer to use an upgrade copy of Windows Vista or Windows 7, however it must be installed as a clean install. Despite this, there is a workaround available via third-party tools that makes upgrading from XP x64 to Windows Vista possible.

The last version of Microsoft Office to be officially compatible with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is Office 2007, however Office 2010 can be unofficially installed by disguising the Windows version using Application Verifier. The last version of Internet Explorer compatible with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is Internet Explorer 8 (Service Pack 2 is required).

==Support lifecycle==
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition follows the same support lifecycles as with all other versions of Windows XP. On April 14, 2009, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition&#x27;s mainstream support expired and the extended support phase began. During the extended support phase, Microsoft continued to provide security updates; however, free technical support, warranty claims, and design changes are no longer being offered. Extended support lasted until April 8, 2014, in line with all other Windows XP editions. After this date, no more security patches or support information are offered.

Although Windows XP Professional x64 Edition is unsupported, Microsoft released an emergency security patch in May 2017 for the OS as well as other unsupported versions of Windows (including Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista and Windows 7 RTM without a service pack), to address a vulnerability that was being leveraged by the WannaCry ransomware attack. In May 2019, an emergency patch was released to address a critical code execution vulnerability in Remote Desktop Services which can be exploited in a similar way as the WannaCry vulnerability.

Microsoft announced in July 2019 that the Microsoft Internet Games services on Windows XP and Windows Me would end on July 31, 2019 (and for Windows 7 on January 22, 2020). Others, such as Steam, had done the same, ending support for Windows XP and Windows Vista in January 2019.

In 2020, Microsoft announced that it would disable the Windows Update service for SHA-1 endpoints. Since Windows XP Professional x64 Edition did not get an update for SHA-2, Windows Update Services are no longer available on the OS as of late July 2020. However, as of April 2021, the old updates for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition are still available on the Microsoft Update Catalog.

<doc id="615925" wikidata="Q5354978" url="?curid=615925" title="Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)">
<text>In the United Kingdom, the Electoral Commission is the national election commission, created in 2001 as a result of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. It is an independent agency that regulates party and election finance and sets standards for how elections should be run.

== Creation ==
The Electoral Commission was created in 2001 following a recommendation by the fifth report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Its mandate was set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA), and ranges from the regulation of political donations and expenditure by political and third parties through to promoting greater participation in the electoral process. The Electoral Administration Act 2006 required local authorities to review all polling stations, and to provide a report on the reviews to the Electoral Commission.

The Political Parties and Elections Act 2009 granted the Electoral Commission a variety of new supervisory and investigatory powers. It also allowed for the appointment of four new electoral commissioners who are nominated by political parties.

== Responsibilities and objectives ==

=== Integrity and transparency of party election finance ===
As the regulator of political party funding in the UK, the Commission&#x27;s role is to ensure the integrity and transparency of party and election finance.

Political parties must submit annual statements of accounts, detailing income and expenditure, to the Electoral Commission. The Commission publishes these on its website. Political parties and regulated donees are required to submit reports of all donations they receive to the Commission. The Commission maintains a publicly available and searchable register of these donations on its website.

At general elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Parliament and Northern Ireland Assembly political parties are required to submit campaign spending returns to the Electoral Commission. Prior to the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, this also applied to parties contesting elections to the European Parliament.

The Commission may impose financial civil penalties on political parties and their accounting units if they fail to submit donation and loans returns, campaign spending return or statements of account. The Commission also has the power to seek forfeiture of impermissible donations accepted by political parties.

=== Registering political parties ===
The Commission registers political parties and regulates party compliance. The Commission maintains the registers of political parties in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

=== Electoral registers and the electoral registration process ===
The Electoral Commission produces guidance and gives advice on electoral registration to electoral registration officers in Great Britain. The Commission has published performance standards for electoral registration in Great Britain. Electoral registration officers are required to report against these standards and the Commission will make this information publicly available.

As part of this work, the Commission runs a series of public awareness campaigns ahead of elections and throughout the year to encourage people to register to vote. These focus on audiences that research indicates are less likely to be on the electoral register, including recent home-movers, students and UK citizens living overseas.

=== Well-run elections and referendums ===
The Commission produces guidance and gives advice on electoral administration to returning officers and electoral administrators in Great Britain. The Commission has set performance standards for returning officers and referendum counting officers in Great Britain. These standards do not apply to local government elections in Scotland as they are a devolved matter. The Commission has a statutory duty to produce reports on the administration of certain elections (for example UK Parliamentary general elections) and may be asked to report on other types of election (such as local government elections).

=== EU seat distribution ===
The Electoral Commission was responsible for recommending which regions were allocated how many of the 73 seats that the United Kingdom held at the European Parliament. The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020.

=== Referendum responsibilities ===
The Electoral Commission has a number of responsibilities in relation to referendums. These include:
*commenting on the wording of the referendum question (the government is responsible for proposing the wording)
*registration of campaigners
*designating lead campaign organisations and the making of grants
*monitoring referendum expenditure limits and donations
*certifying and announcing the result.
*As with other electoral events, the Electoral Commission has a statutory duty to prepare and publish a report on the administration of a relevant referendum and to give guidance and advice to administrators and campaigners.
*The chair of the commission, or someone appointed by the chair, will also be appointed as Chief Counting Officer.

As of 2017, the Electoral Commission has overseen the holding of two UK-wide referendums. The first was the 2011 AV Referendum, and the second and most notable was the 2016 EU Referendum. On both occasions the then chair of the Electoral Commission Jenny Watson acted as the appointed Chief Counting Officer. The Commission also oversaw the 2004 North East England Devolution Referendum, the 2011 Welsh Devolution Referendum and also the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum. The commission has no legal position in the legislation concerning referendums proposed by the devolved Scottish and Welsh administrations.

== Organisation ==
From 1 October 2010, additional Commissioners serve on a part-time basis, nominated by the leaders of political parties, scrutinised by the Speaker&#x27;s Committee on the Electoral Commission and approved by the House of Commons by means of an Address to the King requesting their appointment. Those nominated by the three largest parties serve terms of four years, while the Commissioner nominated by a smaller party serves for a two-year term. The appointments of nominated Commissioners are renewable once.

The current Commissioners are:
* Alasdair Morgan 
* Sarah Chambers
* Lord Gilbert of Panteg
*Professor Dame Elan Closs Stephens CBE
* Joan Walley
* Rob Vincent CBE

=== National commissions ===
To reflect the views of stakeholders and the distinctive procedures and practices in the countries of the United Kingdom there are devolved electoral commissions for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

=== English regional offices ===
Since February 2007, the Commission has had regional offices across England in the South West, Eastern and South East, London, Midlands, and North of England regions.

=== Speaker&#x27;s Committee on the Electoral Commission ===
The Electoral Commission is answerable to Parliament via the Speaker&#x27;s Committee (established by PPERA 2000). The Commission must submit an annual estimate of income and expenditure to the Committee. The Committee, made up of Members of Parliament, is responsible for answering questions on behalf of the Commission. The Member who takes questions for the Speaker&#x27;s Committee is Bridget Phillipson.

=== Parliamentary Parties Panels ===
The Parliamentary Parties Panel (PPP) is composed of representatives from all parliamentary political parties with two or more sitting MPs. The PPP was established by PPERA and meets quarterly to submit views to the Commission on matters affecting political parties.

There are equivalent non-statutory bodies for the devolved legislatures in Wales (Senedd Political Parties Panel), Scotland (Scottish Parliament Political Parties Panel), and Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland Assembly Parties Panel). The latter two are composed of representatives from all parliamentary political parties, without qualifying tresholds.

== Criticism ==
There was widespread controversy surrounding the 2010 UK general election including allegations of fraudulent postal voting, polling stations being unprepared for an evening surge of voters, policing of voters protesting at one polling station, and only enough ballot papers for 80% of voters. The Electoral Commission was criticised for its handling of the election.

The Electoral Commission has been criticised by Nigel Vinson for perceived partisanship, and by Peter Bone for investigations into several notable figures on the Vote Leave Campaign.

In September 2018 the High Court ruled that the Electoral Commission had misinterpreted the rules prior to the referendum taking place in advice it gave to the Vote Leave campaign, allowing them to break the law without even being aware.

On 13 May 2020, during Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, Conservative MP Peter Bone attacked the Electoral Commission for its investigations into four separate members of pro-Leave campaigns, who were all found innocent of any wrongdoing. He called the commission &quot;politically corrupt, totally biased and morally bankrupt&quot;. Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded by saying that he had hoped &quot;all those who spent so much time and energy drawing attention to their supposed guilt would spend just as long drawing attention to their genuine innocence&quot;.

On 29 August 2020, Co-Chairman of the Conservative Party Amanda Milling called for major reform of the Commission in a piece in The Telegraph, accusing the organisation of a &quot;lack of accountability&quot; and of operating by an &quot;unclear rulebook&quot;.

== Proposed changes to legislation governing the Commission ==

In February 2022, the Commission sent a public letter to ministers expressing concern about proposed changes to legislation governing the operation of the Commission. The letter said that the proposed provision in the elections bill for ministers to draw up a &quot;strategy and policy statement&quot;, enabling the government to guide the work of the Commission, was &quot;inconsistent with the role that an independent electoral commission plays in a healthy democracy&quot;. The letter was signed by the full board of the Commission except the Conservative peer Stephen Gilbert. The bill became the Elections Act 2022. 

==Electoral register data breach==
In 2021–2022 the commission computer system was attacked by APT31.

In March 2024, the UK government and the United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) jointly sanctioned a Chinese Ministry of State Security front company called Wuhan Xiaoruizhi Science and Technology and affiliated individuals for breaching the Electoral Commission and placing malware in critical infrastructure.

*1021 – Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) pioneers the experimental scientific method and experimental physics in his &quot;Book of Optics&quot;, where he devises the first scientific experiments on optics, including the first use of the camera obscura to prove that light travels in straight lines and the first experimental proof that visual perception is caused by light rays travelling to the eyes, which also marks the beginning of experimental psychology and psychophysics.
*1030 – Al-Biruni conducts the first elaborate experiments related to astronomical phenomena and introduces the experimental method into mechanics.

==12th century==
*1121 – Al-Khazini makes extensive use of the experimental method to prove his theories on mechanics in &quot;The Book of the Balance of Wisdom&quot;.
* Ibn Zuhr (Avenzoar) is the first physician to carry out human postmortem dissections and autopsies. He proves that the skin disease scabies is caused by a parasite, a discovery which upsets the Hippocratic and Galenic theory of humorism.

==13th century==
* 1200 – Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi observes and examines a large number of skeletons, and he discovered that Galen was incorrect regarding the formation of the bones of the lower jaw and sacrum.
* 1242 – Ibn al-Nafis carries out autopsies which leads him to the discovery of pulmonary circulation and the circulatory system.
*Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī provides the first correct explanation of the rainbow phenomenon and uses the experimental method to prove his theory.
* Albertus Magnus documents that nitric acid can dissolve silver and the resulting silver nitrate solution will blacken skin.

==16th century==

<text>Russian humour gains much of its wit from the inflection of the Russian language, allowing for plays on words and unexpected associations. As with any other culture&#x27;s humour, its vast scope ranges from lewd jokes and wordplay to political satire.

== Literature ==

=== 17th century ===
According to Dmitry Likhachov, Russian comedy traditions in literature could be traced back to &quot;Praying of Daniel the Immured&quot; by Daniil Zatochnik, a Pereyaslavl-born lower class writer who lived between the 12th and 13th centuries. However, it wasn&#x27;t until the early 17th century when comedy developed into a separate genre as a reaction to the Time of Troubles. A whole line of independent anonymously published works gained popularity; the term &quot;democratic satire&quot; is used by researchers to describe them. All had close ties to the folklore of Russia and were rewritten both in prose and as poems, including &quot;nebylitsa&quot; (a variation of nursery rhymes).

Most famous are &quot;The Tale of Yersh Yershovich&quot; and &quot;The Tale of Shemyaka&#x27;s Trial&quot; that satirized the Russian judicial system: the first described a trial against a sleazy ruffe, with different fish representing different social classes, while the second focused on a corrupted judge Shemyaka who is often linked to Dmitry Shemyaka. Another outstanding work, &quot;The Tale of Frol Skobeev&quot;, was inspired by picaresque novels. Satire on Church was also very popular (&quot;The Tale of Savva the Priest&quot;, &quot;The Kalyazin Petition&quot;, &quot;The Tavern Service&quot;) which included parodies of religious texts. Mikhail Bakhtin and Dmitry Likhachov agreed on that many tales were created by low-ranking clergy who made fun of the form rather than content. There were also straight-up parodies of literary genres such as &quot;The Story of a Life in Luxury and Fun&quot;.

Lubok was one of the earliest known forms of popular print in Russia which rose to popularity around the same time. Similar to comic strips, it depicted various — often humorous — anecdotes as primitivistic pictures with captions. Among the common characters was The Cat of Kazan which appeared in one of the most famous lubki &quot;The Mice Are Burying the Cat&quot; described by various researchers as a parody on the funeral of Peter the Great, a celebration of Russian victories over the Tatars during the late 16th century or simply an illustration to an old fairy tale.

=== 18th century ===
Next century saw the rise of a number of prominent comedy writers who belonged to the upper class. The most renowned is Denis Fonvizin who produced several comedy plays between 1769 and 1792, most famously &quot;The Minor&quot; (1781) about a nobleman without a high school diploma. It satirized provincial nobility and became a great success and a source of many quotes, inspiring many future generations of writers. Other names include Antiochus Kantemir who wrote satirical poems and a dramatist Alexander Sumarokov whose plays varied from a straight-up satire against his enemies to comedy of manners as well as the Russian Empress Catherine the Great who produced around 20 comedy plays and operas, most famously &quot;Oh, These Time!&quot; (1772) and &quot;The Siberian Shaman&quot; (1786).

== Satirical magazines ==
During the second half of the 18th century satirical magazines rose to popularity, providing social and political commentary. Those included &quot;Pochta dukhov&quot; (&quot;Spirits Mail&quot;) and &quot;Zritel&quot; (&quot;The Spectator&quot;) by Ivan Krylov who later turned into the leading Russian fabulist, &quot;Zhivopisets&quot; (&quot;The Painter&quot;) and &quot;Truten&quot; (&quot;The Drone&quot;) by Nikolay Novikov and even &quot;Vsyakaya vsyachina&quot; (&quot;All Sorts&quot;) established and edited by Catherine the Great herself. Alexander Afanasyev&#x27;s 1859 monograph &quot;Russian Satirical Magazines of 1769—1774&quot; became an in-depth research on this period and inspired a famous critical essay &quot;Russian satire during the times of Catherine&quot; by Nikolay Dobrolyubov who argued that the 18th-century satire wasn&#x27;t sharp or influential enough and didn&#x27;t lead to necessary socio-political changes.

== Jokes ==

The most popular form of Russian humour consists of jokes (анекдоты — anekdoty), which are short stories with a punch line. Typical of Russian joke culture is a series of categories with fixed and highly familiar settings and characters. Surprising effects are achieved by an endless variety of plots and plays on words.

== Toasts ==

Drinking toasts can take the form of anecdotes or not-so-short stories, which tend to have a jocular or paradoxical conclusion, and ending with &quot;So here&#x27;s to, let&#x27;s drink for the...&quot; with a witty punchline referring to the initial story.

== Chastushka ==

A specific form of humour is chastushkas, songs composed of four-line rhymes, usually of black, sarcastic, humoristic, or satiric content.

== Black humour ==
Apart from jokes, Russian humour is very sarcastic and it is expressed in word play. Sometimes there are short poems including nonsense and black humour verses, similar to the Little Willie rhymes by Harry Graham, or, less so, Edward Lear&#x27;s literary &quot;nonsense verse&quot;.

Often they have recurring characters such as &quot;little boy&quot;, &quot;Vova&quot;, &quot;a girl&quot;, &quot;Masha&quot;. Most rhymes involve death or a painful experience either for the protagonists or other people. This type of joke is especially popular with children.

== Career ==
=== 2000–2003: Debut and initial struggles ===
In 2000, Bachchan made his film debut playing the male lead in J. P. Dutta&#x27;s war drama &quot;Refugee&quot; opposite Kareena Kapoor, who was also making her debut in the film. Although the film was an average at the box office, both Bachchan and Kapoor received positive reviews for their performances. Film critic Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; wrote that he &quot;has all it takes to emerge a competent actor in years to come. Even in his debut-making film, Abhishek comes across as a fine actor and lives up to his family name.&quot; Bachchan next appeared opposite Keerthi Reddy in &quot;Tera Jadoo Chal Gayaa&quot;, portraying an artist who falls in a one-sided love. The movie was neither commercially nor critically well-received. His third release of the year, &quot;Dhai Akshar Prem Ke&quot;, was a remake of the 1995 American film &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; and turned out to be a box office flop. In 2001, he starred in &quot;Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai&quot;, which failed to gain a wide audience theatrically. He also shot for a cameo in the 2001 film &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, a scene which was later edited out of the film.

In 2002, Bachchan had four film releases, the first of which was the romantic drama &quot;Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya&quot;, opposite Karisma Kapoor and Akshay Kumar. He then made a cameo in the Bengali film &quot;Desh&quot;, which starred his mother Jaya Bachchan. His next role was in the comedy drama &quot;Shararat&quot;, followed by &quot;Om Jai Jagadish&quot;, where he was part of an ensemble cast. Both movies failed commercially. Bachchan&#x27;s performance in Sooraj R. Barjatya&#x27;s romantic dramedy &quot;Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon&quot; (2003) earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, although the film was a flop. In the same year, Bachchan starred alongside Lara Dutta in the drama &quot;Mumbai Se Aaya Mera Dost&quot;. The movie did not perform well commercially and received negative reviews. He then starred opposite Aishwarya Rai in &quot;Kuch Naa Kaho&quot; and joined Ajay Devgn and Bipasha Basu in &quot;Zameen&quot;. Neither of these films fared well critically or commercially. For his final release of 2003, Bachchan appeared among an ensemble cast in &quot;&quot;, portraying Vikram Batra. It received mixed to negative reviews and was not a commercial success.

=== 2004–2009: Rise to prominence ===
Bachchan&#x27;s first project in 2004, &quot;Run&quot;, was not a success from either a commercial or a critical point of view. He then starred in Mani Ratnam&#x27;s political drama &quot;Yuva&quot; (2004), which had a below average performance at the box office, but earned Bachchan his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor.

The film emerged as the second highest-grossing Hindi film of 2005 and earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. This film also marked his first professional collaboration with his father Amitabh Bachchan, who played a police officer closely following the lead pair. Bachchan was next seen in Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s political drama &quot;Sarkar&quot;, which was a moderate success at the box office. His performance as the morally upright son of a troubled politician (played by his father Amitabh Bachchan) earned him rave reviews from critics as well as his second consecutive Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. His next two releases &quot;Dus&quot; (2005) and &quot;Bluffmaster!&quot; (2005) were both moderately successful, but did not earn much critical appreciation.

He was next seen in &quot;Dhoom 2&quot; (2006), which featured him and Uday Chopra reprising their roles from the original &quot;Dhoom&quot; (2004) joined by new cast members Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai and Bipasha Basu. With earnings of , &quot;Dhoom 2&quot; became the highest grossing Indian film at that time, a distinction that was held for two years, though some critics commented that Bachchan was &quot;reduced to a mere supporting player&quot; to his co-star Roshan.

Madhavan, Mithun Chakraborty, Vidya Balan, and Arya Babbar.

After making a guest appearance in &quot;Mission Istaanbul&quot;, Bachchan&#x27;s next release was the fantasy adventure film &quot;Drona&quot; (2008), which emerged as a major critical and commercial disaster. He was next seen in Tarun Mansukhani&#x27;s &quot;Dostana&quot; (2008), a romantic comedy about two men (Bachchan and John Abraham) who pretend to be gay in order to be allowed to live with a girl (Priyanka Chopra), but then find that they have both fallen in love with her.

<text>James Henry Ellis (25 September 1924 – 25 November 1997) was a British engineer and cryptographer. Born in Australia but raised and educated in Britain, Ellis joined GCHQ in 1952. He worked on a number of cryptographic projects, but is credited with some of the original thinking that developed into the field of Public Key Cryptography (PKC).

==Personal life==
Ellis was born in Australia, but was raised in Britain and orphaned at an early age. He lived with his grandparents in London&#x27;s East End. Ellis showed an early gift for mathematics and physics while attending grammar school in Leyton. He attended Imperial College London. In 1949, Ellis married Brenda, an artist and designer.

==Development of non-secret encryption==
Ellis first proposed his scheme for &quot;non-secret encryption&quot; in 1970, in a (then) secret GCHQ internal report &quot;The Possibility of Secure Non-Secret Digital Encryption&quot;. Ellis said that the idea first occurred to him after reading a paper from World War II by someone at Bell Labs describing the scheme named Project C43, a way to protect voice communications by the receiver adding (and then later subtracting) random noise.

Clifford Cocks and Malcom Williamson, two other GCHQ cryptographers, furthered Ellis&#x27; initial PKC related work. As all of this work prior to 1997 was classified, it never became part of very significant mainstream initiatives that developed into modern PKC commercial endeavors, such as the work on Diffie–Hellman key exchange, RSA and other PKC linked initiatives which have become part of the modern world of Internet security.

On 18 December 1997, Clifford Cocks delivered a public talk which contained a brief history of GCHQ&#x27;s contribution to PKC. In March 2016, Robert Hannigan, the director of GCHQ made a speech at MIT re-emphasising GCHQ&#x27;s early contribution to public-key cryptography and in particular the contributions of Ellis, Cocks and Williamson.

<text>The Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer (BB) is a series of sports cars produced by Ferrari in Italy between 1973 and 1984. The BB was designed by Leonardo Fioravanti at Pininfarina. The first BB model, the 365 GT4 BB, replaced the front engined Daytona and was the first in a series of road-going Ferraris equipped with a mid-mounted flat-twelve engine. The 365 GT4 BB was succeeded in 1976 by the BB 512, equipped with a larger displacement engine, then by the fuel-injected BB 512i in 1981. The series was discontinued in 1984 when the BB 512i was replaced by the Testarossa, which used a revised version of the flat-twelve engine.

==Background==
Production of the BB was a major step for Enzo Ferrari. He felt that a mid-engined road car would be too difficult for his buyers to handle, and it took many years for his engineers to convince him to adopt the layout. This attitude began to change as the marque lost its racing dominance in the late 1950s to mid-engined competitors. As a result, the rear-mid-engined 246 P Formula 1 car was introduced in 1960, followed by the Dino SP racing sports prototypes in 1961. In 1963, the company also moved its V12 engines to the rear with its P and LM racing cars.

Introduced in 1967, the Dino 206 GT and 246 GT/GTS road cars were the first road-going Ferraris to use the rear-mid-engined layout, albeit under the lower-cost Dino marque. Ferrari&#x27;s flagship V12-powered road cars remained front-engined through the early 1970s, with the 365 GTB/4 Daytona and 365 GTC/4 introduced in 1968 and 1971, respectively. In 1973, Ferrari introduced the 365 GT4 Berlinetta Boxer as its first mid-engined 12-cylinder road car.

Ferrari first used the flat-12 engine layout in racing cars, starting with the 1964 512 F1. The 512 F1&#x27;s 1.5 liter engine was designed by Mauro Forghieri, technical director of the racing department. This engine design was further developed in several Formula One and sports prototype racing cars, including the 1968 212 E, 1970-75 312B, and 1971 312PB. These racing engine designs became the basis for the road-going flat 12 engine introduced in the 365 GT4 BB.

== Design and development ==
Following the introduction of the production 365 GTB/4 Daytona in 1969, Ferrari engineers led by Dr. Ing. Angelo Bellei began work on a successor, the 365 GT4 BB. Though it shared its numerical designation with the 365 GTB/4 Daytona, the 365 GT4 BB was radically different in layout than the front-engined 365 GTB/4. The new car was to have rear mid-mounted flat-12 engine, arranged longitudinally. While this configuration was unprecedented among Ferrari road cars, the design team drew upon the existing chassis design of the mid-engine 250 LM and Dino 206/246, as well as the flat-12 engines developed for the Scuderia Ferrari beginning in 1964. The first prototype 365 GT4 BB was unveiled at the 1971 Turin Motor Show. Prototypes were further refined by an extensive road and track testing program led by Ferrari test driver Giorgio Enrico. As Ferrari engineers already had considerable experience with both the layout and engine design, development work proceeded rapidly and only small changes were seen between the early prototypes and the first production 365 GT4 BB. The production 365 GT4 BB was first offered for sale in 1973.

=== Engine and transmission ===

Dr. Ing. Giuliano de Angelis oversaw the development of the &quot;Tipo&quot; &quot;F102A&quot; engine used in the 365 GT4 BB. This engine was derived from both the Mauro Forghieri-designed &quot;Tipo 001&quot; 3.0-litre flat-12 engine used in the 1969 Ferrari 312B Formula One car and the roadgoing 365 GTB/4 engine. The total displacement of the new engine was 4390.35 cc with a bore of 81 mm and a stroke of 71 mm, dimensions which matched the 365 GTB/4 engine.

While the &quot;Berlinetta Boxer&quot; name has been used by both Ferrari and the press to describe BB-series cars, this engine was not a true boxer engine. In the &quot;Tipo&quot; F102 A and its derivatives, each pair of opposing pistons share the same crank pin and move in the same direction during operation. In a boxer engine, pairs of opposing pistons move in opposite directions. On this point, Ferrari engine designer Mauro Forghieri stated &quot;Please, don&#x27;t call it boxer. Technically, it is correct to say that this engine is a flat-12, or has 12 cylinders with the heads at a vee angle of 180°.&quot;

The engine block was constructed of Silumin alloy, with cast iron cylinder liners. Pistons were light alloy and the crankshaft was forged steel. The cylinder head design was very similar to that of the 365 GTB/4, incorporating dual overhead camshafts and two valves per cylinder. The four camshafts were driven by two timing belts, which reduced noise and weight compared to the timing chains used on earlier 12 cylinder Ferrari engines. Air and fuel were supplied via four 3-bbl Weber 40 IF 3C carburetors. The ignition system consisted of a single Magneti Marelli distributor and two coils. The engine was lubricated by a wet sump, which was replaced by a dry sump in the BB512 to avoid oil starvation issues. According to de Angelis and Bellei, the first prototype F102 A engine produced 380 bhp at 7,100 rpm and propelled the prototype to during testing. Ferrari brochures reported the production version of the F102 A engine produced 360 bhp at 7,500 rpm and 311 ft/lb of torque at 4,500 rpm, although figures reported in other factory and press publications vary.

The 365 GT4 BB was equipped with a five-speed manual transaxle and limited-slip differential. The transmission and differential were placed directly underneath the engine, alongside the oil sump. The Fichtel &amp; Sachs single-plate dry clutch was located at the rear of the engine. Power reached the transmission via a set of drop gears and a horizontal shaft. While this layout increased the vertical height of the engine and transmission assembly and raised the car&#x27;s center of gravity, it shortened the overall length of the assembly. This was advantageous for packaging reasons, as a compact engine/transmission meant the chassis could have a short overall wheelbase as well as a comfortable, spacious cabin.

The engine design of the &quot;Tipo&quot; F102 A continued to be developed by Ferrari after the introduction of the 365 GT4 BB. It led to the creation of a family of road-going Ferrari flat-12 engines, including the F102 B (used in the BB 512), F110 A (used in the BBi 512) and the engines of the Testarossa, 512TR and F512M. These later engines had an overall displacement of 5 liters.

=== Styling ===

The body of the 365 GT4 BB was styled at Pininfarina, supervised by Leonardo Fioravanti. The design was influenced by the Ferrari P6 Berlinetta Speciale, a one-off concept car created by Pininfarina in 1968. The first 365 GT4 BB prototype was presented to the public at the 1971 Turin Auto Show. It had a low, wedge shaped nose with hidden headlamps, a steeply raked windscreen and a wide rear section truncated by a vertical tail. The design was refined using wind tunnel testing at Pininfarina&#x27;s facility. As a result of these aerodynamic studies, a spoiler was placed behind and above the passenger compartment, spanning the two buttresses or sail panels on either side of the engine cover. This spoiler was intended to reduce drag, improve stability and direct air into the intakes on the top of the engine cover.

The central section of the bodywork was constructed of steel, while the front and rear covers and door were constructed of aluminum alloy. The front and rear lower valences/bumpers were fiberglass. The front and rear covers are a clamshell design, with hinges allowing the front cover to pivot forward and the rear engine cover to pivot rearward. This allowed easier maintenance access to the engine and use of the small front luggage compartment.

The 1971 prototype&#x27;s paint scheme was designed to lower and reduce the visual mass of the car when seen in profile. To this effect, the bodywork was split with a horizontal seam near the top of the wheel rims and everything below this point was painted satin black, including both front and rear bumpers. This two-tone paint scheme would carry over into production BB models. Ferrari later offered the two-tone paint scheme as an option on other models such as the 308, where it was commonly referred to as &quot;Boxer&quot; paint.

The bodywork of the 1971 Turin Auto Show prototype closely represented that of the production 365 GT4 BB, with some small differences. The prototype had four tail lamps, while the production 365 GT4 BB had six. The prototype&#x27;s fuel filler was placed below the rear quarter window, but this was relocated to a buttress/sail panel in the production version. This design was carried over with only minor changes through the final model of the series, the BB 512i.

=== Chassis and suspension ===
The 365 GT4 BB chassis was constructed of steel tubing, as was standard Ferrari practice at the time. According to lead engineer Dr. Ing. Angelo Bellei, the chassis design was directly influenced by the chassis of the 250 LM and the Dino 206/246. While the central bodywork formed a semi-monocoque with the steel chassis, the front and rear bodywork was unstressed and only supported by light subframes. The front bodywork and subframe was designed to deform and absorb energy during a crash. Crash safety was also improved by the presence of two large diameter tubes which ran diagonally from the engine cradle to the roof, providing extra strength during a rollover crash.

All four wheels had double wishbone independent suspension, with a single coil spring and shock absorber for each front wheel and a pair for each rear wheel. Dual anti-roll bars, non-powered rack and pinion steering and four wheel disc brakes were also equipped. The 365 GT4 BB was fitted with Michelin XWX tires, with front and rear tires both sized 215 70 VR 15. Later models would use a staggered configuration with wider rear tires.

== Production history ==

=== 365 GT4 BB ===
The production version of the 365 GT4 BB was introduced at the 1973 Paris Motor Show. The start of production coincided with the 1973 oil crisis, and as a result initial demand was low. Ferrari initially planned a limited production run of only 25 cars. Production began slowly, with only two dozen cars constructed during the first year of production. Demand gradually increased and later cars were produced at the rate of one per day. In total, 387 examples were built between 1973 and 1976, making it the rarest of all Berlinetta Boxer models. 88 were right-hand drive, with 58 of these intended for the UK market. Production 365 GT4 BB bodywork was constructed by Scaglietti and final assembly took place at Ferrari&#x27;s factory in Maranello.

Factory list price in 1973 was 18,290,000 Lire. By 1976, the price increased to 24,375,000 L., approximately US$30,000. List price in the UK was in 1975. Air conditioning was optional, but most buyers selected it. Buyers could choose the two-tone &quot;Boxer&quot; paint with a black lower half, or conventional single color paint.

Contemporary press reception to the 365 GT4 BB was positive and journalists praised the car&#x27;s handling and straight line performance. Road &amp; Track tested a 365 GT4 BB in June 1975. The clutch in their test car slipped, but they still measured 0-60 mph in 7.2 seconds, 0-100 mph in 14.8 seconds and a standing quarter mile time of 15.5 seconds. R&amp;T testers reached a top speed of 175 mph, making the 365 GT4 BB the fastest road car tested at the time. A later test of a fully functional car in the November 1976 issue of Car and Driver recorded 0-60 mph in 6.1 seconds and 0-100 mph in 14.1 seconds.


=== BB 512 ===
The 365 GT4 BB was replaced by the BB 512 (also known as the 512 BB) in 1976.
The name &quot;512&quot; referred to the car&#x27;s 5 litre, 12 cylinder engine, resurrecting the name of the earlier Ferrari 512 racer. This was a deviation from Ferrari&#x27;s established practice of naming 12-cylinder road cars (as the 365 BB) after their individual cylinder displacement.
The new model was first shown to the public at the 1976 Paris Motor Show.

The &quot;Tipo&quot; F102 B engine was enlarged to 4943 cc. Bore and stroke were now 82 mm x 78 mm and the compression ratio was increased to 9.2:1. Ferrari sales brochures claimed a peak power output of ; later Ferrari publications revised this to . This was lower than the claimed power of the 365 GT4 BB, but the BB 512 reached peak power at 6200 rpm, lower than the 7000 rpm peak of the previous model. Torque slightly increased to at 4300 rpm. Despite the loss in peak power, the flatter torque curve of the 5 liter engine provided a smoother and more user friendly power delivery. The larger displacement engine also allowed Ferrari to meet more stringent pollution and noise regulations without losing performance.

Autocar tested a BB512 in May 1978, when they measured 0-60 mph in 6.2 seconds and reached a speed of 163 mph (262 km/h). Although these figures are not as high as those published in other road tests, it was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world&#x27;s fastest independently road-tested production car.

A dual plate clutch handled the added torque and eased the pedal effort. Dry sump lubrication prevented oil starvation in hard cornering. In order to improve grip, the rear Michelin XWX tires were increased in width to 225 70 VR 15 and the rear wheels were widened from 7.5 inches to 9 inches wide. The front tires remained 215 70 VR 15 on 7.5 inch wide wheels, as on the 365 GT4 BB. The chassis remained unaltered, but these wider rear tires meant the rear track increased to 1563 mm and the rear bodywork was widened accordingly.

External differentiators included a new chin spoiler upfront, incorporated in the bumper. At top speed the nose of 365 GT4 BB lifted 1 inch; the BB 512&#x27;s chin spoiler eliminated this tendency. NACA ducts were added behind the door on each side, provided cooling for the exhaust system and rear brakes. At the rear, there were now twin tail lights and exhaust pipes each side, instead of triple units as on the 365 GT4 BB. The panel between the taillights was now slats, instead of black mesh. The number of vents in the engine cover increased, in order to improve engine cooling.

List price in the UK was in 1977.

929 examples of the BB 512 were produced between 1976 and 1981.
=== BB 512i ===
The BB 512i (also known as the 512 BBi) was introduced in 1981 and was the last of the series. The &quot;Tipo&quot; F110 A engine now incorporated Bosch K-Jetronic CIS fuel injection. The fuel injected motor produced cleaner emissions and offered a better balance of performance and driveability. Camshaft timing was changed and the Magneti Marelli &quot;Dinoplex&quot; electronic ignition system now had a built-in rev limiter. Claimed peak power output was at 6,000 rpm, making the BB 512i the least powerful model in the series.

External differentiators from the BB 512 besides badging include small white running lights in the front fascia, a front grill that exposed the driving lamps, and a revised rear valence incorporating red fog lamps outboard of the exhaust pipes. Engine cover venting was also revised.

The BB 512i used Michelin TRX metric-sized tires and wheels, replacing the Michelin XWX tires used on earlier BB models. Tires were sized 240/55 VR 415 front and rear, with wheels sized 180 TR 415 front and 210 TR 415 rear.

List price of the BB 512i in the UK was in 1981. Air conditioning, power windows, and a stereo were all standard equipment. Buyers could specify an optional interior trimmed with Ermenegildo Zegna wool cloth in the seats, door panels and headliner. This was a rare option, with possibly only 27 examples so equipped.

1,007 examples of the BB 512i were produced between 1981 and 1984.

=== Berlinetta Boxer in North America ===

Neither the BB, nor its closest competitor, Lamborghini Countach, were built from the factory to meet United States or Canadian safety and emissions regulations. Enzo Ferrari believed that emerging environmental and safety regulations and the 55 MPH national speed limit suggested the company&#x27;s eight-cylinder cars would suffice in the &quot;Malaise era&quot; U.S. market. The 365 GT4 BB was also initially planned for a very limited production run, which Ferrari believed could be easily sold in Europe alone.

Americans purchased the Berlinetta Boxer anyway, and both individual consumers and even authorized Ferrari dealers paid to modify each vehicle to meet United States Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of Transportation regulations. This was known as the &quot;grey market era (1976-1988).&quot; While the BB, Lamborghini Countach, and Range Rover were among the first such vehicles, the infrastructure they created allowed the &quot;grey market&quot; to reach 66,900 vehicles in 1985.

The first 365/512 BBs to legally arrive in the US were modified by Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Fritz and his company, Amerispec. Fritz entered into an agreement with Ferrari dealer Chinetti Motors, his former employer, to modify and legalize a BB imported by the dealer. At that time there was no set process for determining whether an imported car met US government regulations. In order to resolve this issue, Fritz met with EPA and DOT officials to write a set of rules and tests to determine whether any specific imported car met legal requirements. Once these discussions yielded a set of enforceable requirements, Fritz began modifying BBs to meet them. This modification process, commonly known as &quot;federalization&quot;, involved changes to the engine, instrumentation, lighting, seatbelts, and crash reinforcements. Amerispec&#x27;s federalization process involved over 75 different changes. The front bumper and subframe had to be extensively modified in order to meet the &quot;5 mph&quot; zero damage standard in effect at the time. Carbureted models were modified with a secondary air injection system, catalytic converters, and various tuning adjustments in order to meet US emissions standards. The fuel injected BB 512i required fewer emissions-related modifications. The average cost to federalize a new BB was US$14,000.

After Amerispec proved the federalization process was legal and practical, other companies began offering federalization services. There was no standardized process for federalization and companies differed in their approach. As a result, many BBs entered the US in varying states of modification and compliance. Due to short staffing at the EPA and DOT, not all cars were rigorously inspected. In 1990, new laws came into effect that forbid importation of all cars which had no comparable USA-spec model, unless the car is more than 25 years old. This ended the practice of federalization and outlawed further importation of BB models until they reached the 25 year old cutoff. While all BB models can currently be imported into the US without modification, some cars still retain federalization modifications from the &quot;grey market&quot; era. Removing these modifications can involve significant practical and bureaucratic difficulties for owners and restorers.

==Specifications and performance==
Measurements are notoriously variable, inaccurate, and definitionally vague even from Ferrari-issued sources of the same period. For example, the workshop manual documents maximum speed (typically speed at redline), whereas the owner&#x27;s manual documents &quot;attainable&quot; speed, which appears to be speed at maximum HP per RPM not exceeding redline; for the 512 and 512i, this is likely not the maximum speed. Also, the workshop manual does not consistently distinguish measurements between the carbureted (512) and injected (512i) engines except with respect to the fuel delivery system, even though it is common knowledge that differences exist.


==Racing history==

=== 365 GT4 BB ===
The 365 GT4 BB was never officially raced by Scuderia Ferrari, however Luigi Chinetti&#x27;s North American Racing Team (NART) raced modified street cars with some factory support. In 1974, NART obtained two 365 GT4 BBs for use in sports car racing. These cars, chassis 18139 and 18095, began as standard road cars and were modified for competition use.

Chassis 18139 was totally disassembled by NART mechanics and received extensive modifications. These included removal of the factory interior, installation of a roll cage and larger fuel tank, improved suspension, wider bodywork with fixed headlights and wider wheels. Carburetor tuning was slightly adjusted and a new exhaust system was installed, but the engine was otherwise unmodified. 18139 was entered in the 1975 24 Hours of Daytona, but retired before the race after breaking a hub carrier during practice. 18139 finished 6th overall at the 12 Hours of Sebring two months later, then was entered at Road Atlanta where broke another hub carrier during practice and Lime Rock, where it retired from the race due to a broken connecting rod. The car was inactive during the 1976 season, then was entered in the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans by NART. The car finished 16th overall and 5th in the IMSA class, driven by Francois Migault and Lucien Guitteny. For the 1978 season, 18139 was fitted with a 512 engine supplied by the factory. It placed 22nd overall at the 1978 24 hours of Daytona (again driven by Migault and Guitteny), 21st at Road Atlanta, 16th overall and 3rd in class at Le Mans and 11th at the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. 18139&#x27;s final competition appearance was in 1984 at the 6 Hours of Riverside. Although the car had been upgraded, it was no longer competitive and retired after 76 laps.

Chassis 18095 was also modified by NART, but not as radically as 18139. Wider wheels were used, measuring 8 in wide front and 11 in wide rear. The wheel arches were flared, a small rear spoiler and racing fuel filler were installed and the interior adapted with safety equipment including a roll bar, harness and fire extinguisher. The engine was standard except for a spacer to increase oil capacity and a new exhaust system. This car was entered in the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans, but did not compete as NART withdrew from the race in protest over how the race organizers chose to classify their 308 GT4.

=== 512 BB LM ===
In 1978, Ferrari began producing a purpose-built competition version of the BB 512, termed the 512 BB LM (also styled 512 BB/LM or 512 BBLM). They were produced in two series, with the first series constructed in 1978 and the second series constructed between late 1978 and 1982.

Ferrari constructed three examples of the series one 512 BB LM in 1978. These had wider wheel arches, a roof-mounted aerofoil, and a rear wing adapted from the front wing of a Ferrari 312T2. Two of these cars were fitted with &quot;long nose&quot; bodywork, which extended the front of the car by several inches and replaced the standard full-width grill with a small oval air inlet. Power from the flat-12 was increased to approximately 400-440 bhp, while the cars&#x27; weight was decreased to approximately 1,200 kg (2,646 lb).

The three factory S1 BB LMs competed in the 1978 24 Hours of Le Mans, with two cars entered by Ferrari importer Charles Pozzi and one car entered by NART. Jacques Swaters&#x27; Ecurie Francorchamps entered one additional 512 BB, which was converted to competition specification by the team. This car differed from the factory BB LM cars, weighing approximately 100 kg (220 lb) more. None of these cars finished the race due to mechanical issues.

After the failure of the first series, Ferrari worked on fixing the BB LM with a second development program in late 1978. The flat-12&#x27;s carburetors were replaced with a Lucas mechanical fuel injection system to increase power to approximately 470-480 bhp. The transmission and cooling system were improved to handle the additional power. The production-based bodywork of the first BB LMs was replaced by a new design developed by Pininfarina which carried over very little of the original styling. The bodywork was now 16 in (41 cm) longer and 6 in (15 cm) wider, increasing overall weight compared to the S1 by 30 kg (66 lb). The pop-up headlights were now replaced by fixed units integrated into the fascia, while the tail was lengthened to the maximum allowed by regulations. Wider wheels were equipped, measuring 10in wide at the front and 13 in wide at the rear. Brakes and suspension were also improved. Nine of these S2 BB LMs were built by Ferrari in 1979.

The S2 design was further improved in 1980, including vertical side skirts to take advantage of ground effect, a larger air inlet duct in front of the rear wheels and a lighter chassis with fiberglass body panels, reducing weight by 100 kg (220 lb). Some sources refer to these as series 3 cars. Sixteen updated S2 BB LMs were built from 1980 to 1982, bringing the total number of S2 512 BB LMs manufactured to 25.

The 512 BB LM was never raced by Scuderia Ferrari, but was instead campaigned by several independent teams with varying levels of factory support. Teams that used the BB LM in competition include NART, Pozzi, Ecurie Francorchamps, Bellancauto and others. The BB LM was campaigned in World Endurance Championship and IMSA races as well as smaller local events from its introduction in 1978 through 1985. Both S1 and S2 BB LMs had reliability issues that limited their competition success. This was exacerbated by the lack of a factory racing effort, as the BB LM was only raced by private teams with limited budgets and inconsistent factory support. Among the BB LM&#x27;s best finishes was a fifth overall and first in the GTX class at the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans, 6th overall at the 1982 24 hours of Le Mans and 10th overall at the 1980 24 hours of Le Mans. Since their retirement from top-level competition, BB LMs have competed at various vintage racing events worldwide.

== BB abbreviation ==

The letters &quot;BB&quot; are used as an initialisation for &quot;Berlinetta Boxer&quot; in official Ferrari sales materials, owners manuals and independent press coverage of the 365 GT4 BB, BB 512 and BB 512i. However, two accounts from Ferrari insiders suggest that &quot;Berlinetta Boxer&quot; is a backronym and the letters &quot;BB&quot; originally had a different meaning.

According to engineer Mauro Forghieri, the designation &quot;BB&quot; did not originally mean &quot;Berlinetta Boxer.&quot; During an interview with Davide Cironi, Forghieri stated that they knew the car was not equipped with a boxer engine due to the BB engine&#x27;s crankshaft design. He explained the meaning of the acronym &quot;Berlinetta Boxer&quot; was fabricated by journalists, while the original meaning was &quot;Berlinetta Bialbero&quot; (dual camshaft).

An alternative origin story was put forward by Leonardo Fioravanti: He claimed that the &quot;BB&quot; designation was derived from a nickname given to the car by designer Fioravanti, Angelo Bellei and Sergio Scaglietti. During development of the 365 GT4 BB, they began to refer to the car as &quot;Brigitte Bardot&quot;, as they perceived the prototype to be exceptionally beautiful like the French actress. This nickname was shortened to &quot;BB&quot; and quickly adopted by other Ferrari factory workers. &quot;Berlinetta Boxer&quot; was later invented by Ferrari officials prior to the model&#x27;s introduction at the 1971 Turin Auto Show, as it was deemed unseemly to name a Ferrari after the actress.

<doc id="615958" wikidata="Q1730388" url="?curid=615958" title="Western swing">
<text>Western swing is a subgenre of American country music that originated in the late 1920s in the West and South among the region&#x27;s Western string bands. It is dance music, often with an up-tempo beat, which attracted huge crowds to dance halls and clubs in Texas, Oklahoma and California during the 1930s and 1940s until a federal war-time nightclub tax in 1944 contributed to the genre&#x27;s decline.

The movement was an outgrowth of jazz. The music is an amalgamation of rural, cowboy, polka, old-time, Dixieland jazz, and blues blended with swing; and played by a hot string band often augmented with drums, saxophones, pianos and, notably, the steel guitar. The electrically amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, give the music a distinctive sound. Later incarnations have also included overtones of bebop.

Western swing differs in several ways from the music played by the nationally popular horn-driven big swing bands of the same era. In Western bands, even fully orchestrated bands, vocals, and other instruments followed the fiddle&#x27;s lead, though like popular horn-led bands that arranged and scored their music, most Western bands improvised freely, either by soloists or collectively.

According to country singer Merle Travis, &quot;Western swing is nothing more than a group of talented country boys, unschooled in music, but playing the music they feel, beating a solid two-four rhythm to the harmonies that buzz around their brains. When it escapes in all its musical glory, my friend, you have Western swing.&quot;

==History==

===Late 1920s to mid-1930s: Beginnings===

Western swing began in the dance halls of small towns throughout the lower Great Plains in the late 1920s and early 1930s, growing from house parties and ranch dances where fiddlers and guitarists played for dancers. During its early development, scores of groups from San Antonio to Shreveport to Oklahoma City played different songs with the same basic sound. Prince Albert Hunt&#x27;s Texas Ramblers out of Terrell in East Texas, and the East Texas Serenaders in Lindale, Texas both added jazz elements to traditional music in the later half of the 1920s through the early 1930s. Fred &quot;Papa&quot; Calhoun played in a band in Decatur, Texas that played swing music in the style of the Louisiana Five.

In the early 1930s, Bob Wills and Milton Brown co-founded the string band that became the Light Crust Doughboys, the first professional western swing band. The group, with Fred &quot;Papa&quot; Calhoun on piano, played dance halls and was heard on radio. Photographs of the Light Crust Doughboys taken as early as 1931 show two guitars along with fiddle player Wills, although by 1933 they had three guitarists.

On February 9, 1932, Brown, his brother Derwood, Bob Wills, and C.G. &quot;Sleepy&quot; Johnson were recorded by Victor Records at the Jefferson Hotel in Dallas, Texas under the name The Fort Worth Doughboys. Derwood Brown played guitar and Johnson played tenor guitar. Both &quot;Sunbonnet Sue&quot; and &quot;Nancy Jane&quot; were recorded that day. The group was credited as &quot;Milton Brown and His Musical Brownies&quot;.

When Brown left the Doughboys later in 1932, he took his brother to play rhythm guitar in what became The Musical Brownies. In January 1933, fiddler Cecil Brower, playing harmony, joined Jesse Ashlock to create the first example of harmonizing twin fiddles in a western swing recording. Brower, a classically trained violinist, was the first to master Joe Venuti&#x27;s &quot;double shuffle&quot; and his improvisational style was a major contribution to the genre.

In late 1933, Wills organized the Texas Playboys in Waco, Texas. Recording rosters show that beginning in September 1935, Wills utilized two fiddles, two guitars, and Leon McAuliffe playing steel guitar, banjo, drums and other instruments during recording sessions. The amplified stringed instruments, especially the steel guitar, gave the music its distinctive sound. As early as 1934 or 1935 Bob Dunn electrified a Martin O-series acoustic guitar while playing with Milton Brown&#x27;s Brownies, an idea he may have picked up from a Black guitarist he met while working at Coney Island in New York.

By the mid-1930s, Fort Worth was a hub for Western swing, particularly at the Crystal Springs Dance Pavilion, a country music dance venue that was popular until the 1950s. Bands like Brown and His Musical Brownies played there, interspersing waltzes and ballads with faster songs.

A documented instance of a Western swing group adopting the newer, by then mainstream  meter swing jazz style, replacing the style, was when producer Art Satherley required it at a September 1936 Light Crust Doughboy recording session.

1938 session rosters for Wills recordings show both lead guitar and electric guitar in addition to guitar and steel guitar. The &quot;front line&quot; of Wills&#x27; orchestra consisted of either fiddles or guitars after 1944.

Wills recalled the early days of Western swing music in a 1949 interview. Speaking of Milton Brown and himself—working with popular songs done by Jimmie Davis, the Skillet Lickers, Jimmie Rodgers, songs he had learned from his father and others—Wills said, &quot;We&#x27;d...pull these tunes down an set &#x27;em in a dance category. ...They wouldn&#x27;t be a runaway...and just lay a real beat behind it an&#x27; the people would began to really like it. ...It was nobody intended to start anything in the world. We was just tryin&#x27; to find enough tunes to keep &#x27;em dancin&#x27; to not have to repeat so much.&quot;

===Late 1930s to mid-1940s: Height of popularity===

Western swing was extremely popular throughout the West in the years before World War II and blossomed on the West Coast during the war. Radio broadcasts transmitted live shows to radio stations across the South and the Southwest, reaching millions of listeners. Throughout the 1940s, the Light Crust Doughboys&#x27; shows were featured on 170 radio stations in the region. From 1934 to 1943, Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys played nightly at Cain&#x27;s Ballroom in Tulsa. 50,000-watt radio station KVOO broadcast daily programs. Regular shows continued until 1958 with Johnnie Lee Wills as the bandleader.

Phillips developed a circuit of dance halls and bands to play for them. Among these halls in 1942 were the Los Angeles County Barn Dance at the Venice Pier Ballroom, the Town Hall Ballroom in Compton, the Plantation in Culver City, the Baldwin Park Ballroom, and the Riverside Rancho. These Western dances were a huge success.

One group which played at the Venice Pier Ballroom was led by Jimmy Wakely with Spade Cooley, his successor as bandleader, on fiddle. Several thousand dancers would turn out on Saturday nights. When Bob Wills played the Los Angeles Country Barn Dance at the Venice Pier for three nights shortly before he broke up his band to join the U.S. Army during World War II, the attendance was above 15,000. Fearing the dance floor would collapse, police stopped ticket sales at 11 p.m. The line outside at that time was ten deep and stretched into Venice. Another source states Wills attracted 8,600 fans.

In 1950, Hank Penny and Armand Gautier opened the Palomino in North Hollywood, which became a major venue for country fans in Hollywood. &quot;Western jazz&quot; brought it its initial popularity. Western swing bandleader Hank Thompson, who was stationed in San Pedro during World War II, said it was not uncommon to see &quot;ten thousand people at the pier&quot; at Redondo Beach.

Fred &quot;Poppa&quot; Calhoun, piano player for Milton Brown, vividly remembered how people in Texas and Oklahoma danced when Bob Wills played. &quot;They were pretty simple couples dances, two steps and the Lindy Hop with a few Western twirls added for good measure. By 1937 the jitterbug hit big in the West and allowed much greater freedom of movement. But the jitterbug was different in the West. It wasn&#x27;t all out boogie woogie; it was &#x27;swingier&#x27;—more smooth and subdued.&quot;

===Post-war decline===
In 1944, with the United States&#x27; continuing involvement in World War II, a 30% federal excise tax was levied against night clubs that featured dancing. Although the tax was later reduced to 20%, &quot;No Dancing Allowed&quot; signs went up all over the country. It has been argued that this tax had a significant role in the decline of public dancing as a recreational activity in the United States.

Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys remained popular after the war, and could not provide enough new recordings to fill demand. In 1947 Columbia reissued 70 of their older recordings. In January 1953 &quot;Billboard&quot; reported Spade Cooley played to 192,000 payees over 52 Saturday night dates at the Santa Monica Ballroom, grossing $220,000.

In 1955, Decca Records, in what &quot;Billboard&quot; called &quot;an ambitious project&quot;, issued seven albums of &quot;country dance music&quot; featuring &quot;swingy arrangements of your customers &#x27;c&amp;w&#x27; dance favorites&quot;. Milton Brown and His Brownies, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys, Spade Cooley and His Buckle-Busters, Adolph Hofner and His San Antonians, Tex Williams and His String Band, Grady Martin and His Winging Strings, and Billy Gray and His Western Okies all had their own albums. In November, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported Decca was rushing out three more albums in the series, albeit with less of a Western swing flavor.

==Origin of the name==
The genre now called Western swing originated from the dance music of the 1920s–1930s, but lacked a coherent label until after the Second World War. The term &quot;swing music&quot;, referring to big band dance music, did not come into use until the 1932 Duke Ellington hit &quot;It Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing (If It Ain&#x27;t Got That Swing)&quot;. Recording companies came up with several names before World War II trying to market the strain that would eventually be known as &quot;Western&quot; swing—hillbilly, old-time music, novelty hot dance, hot string band, and even Texas swing for music coming out of Texas and Louisiana. Most of the big Western dance bandleaders simply referred to themselves as Western bands and their music as Western dance music, many adamantly refusing the hillbilly label.

Bob Wills and others believed the term Western swing was first used for his music while he and his band were still in Tulsa, Oklahoma between 1939 and 1942. The Los Angeles-area &quot;Wilmington Press&quot; carried ads for an unidentified &quot;Western Swing Orchestra&quot; at a local nightspot in April 1942. That winter, influential LA-area jazz and swing disc jockey Al Jarvis held a radio contest for top popular band leaders. The winner would be named &quot;the King of Swing&quot;. When Spade Cooley unexpectedly received the most votes, besting favorites Benny Goodman and Harry James, Jarvis declared Cooley to be the King of &quot;Western&quot; Swing.

Around 1942, Cooley&#x27;s promoter, disc jockey &quot;Foreman&quot; Phillips, began using &quot;Western swing&quot; to advertise his client. By 1944, the term had become solidified. On May 6, 1944, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine contained the following: &quot;Spade Cooley, who moved in with his Western swing boys several months ago, has released the Breakfast Club.&quot; On June 10, 1944, the same magazine wrote: &quot;...what with the trend to Western music in this section, Cooley&#x27;s Western swing band is a natural.&quot; A more widely-known &quot;first use&quot; was an October 1944 &quot;Billboard&quot; item mentioning a forthcoming songbook by Cooley titled &quot;Western Swing&quot;. After that, the style became known as Western swing.

==Legacy==
Western swing influenced honky-tonk, rockabilly, and country rock music, popularizing electrically amplified instruments in country music, along with drums reinforcing a strong backbeat, expanded instrumentation, a heavy backbeat superimposed over a polka or waltz beat, and jazz/blues solo styles. 

In 2011, the Texas Legislature adopted a resolution designating western swing as the official &quot;State Music of Texas&quot;.

<text>In cryptography, KHAZAD is a block cipher designed by Paulo S. L. M. Barreto together with Vincent Rijmen, one of the designers of the Advanced Encryption Standard (Rijndael). KHAZAD is named after Khazad-dûm, the fictional dwarven realm in the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien (see also Khazad). KHAZAD was presented at the first NESSIE workshop in 2000, and, after some small changes, was selected as a finalist in the project.

KHAZAD has an eight-round substitution–permutation network structure similar to that of SHARK, a forerunner to Rijndael. The design is classed as a &quot;legacy-level&quot; algorithm, with a 64-bit block size (in common with older ciphers such as DES and IDEA) and a 128-bit key. KHAZAD makes heavy use of involutions as subcomponents; this minimises the difference between the algorithms for encryption and decryption.

The authors have stated that, &quot;KHAZAD is not (and will never be) patented. It may be used free of charge for any purpose.&quot;

Frédéric Muller has discovered an attack which can break five of KHAZAD&#x27;s eight rounds. No attacks better than this are known as of August 2009.

<doc id="615968" wikidata="Q1634279" url="?curid=615968" title="The Bat!">
<text>The Bat! is an email client for the Microsoft Windows operating system, developed by Moldovan software company Ritlabs. It is sold as shareware and offered in three editions: Home Edition, Professional Edition, and Voyager which is a portable version and is included with Professional Edition.

== Developers ==
Ritlabs, SRL is based in Chişinău, Moldova. It was founded as RIT Research Labs in 1992 by Sergey Demchenko and Slava Filimonov, and were the creators of the DOS Navigator file manager.

Alongside The Bat!, Ritlabs also offer a mail server software called BatPost.

==Features==
===Protocols and data security===
The Bat! supports POP3 and IMAP alongside their SSL variants, and SMTP including secure STARTTLS connections. Microsoft Exchange Server is also supported via MAPI. 

The internal PGP implementation based on OpenSSL lets users encrypt messages and sign them with digital signatures. Digital keys manager is included. PGP up to version 10.0.2 is supported. The Bat! supports S/MIME via Internal Implementation or Microsoft CryptoAPI, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) v3.0 / Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.0, v1.1, and 1.2 (as of version 8.5) with AES algorithm.

The Bat! v9.1 supports TLS AEAD AES-GCM cipher suites for secure connections with mail servers. The Bat! v9.2.3 and subsequent ones unfortunately are not yet completely in compliance with the Google&#x27;s security standards related to the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

The Bat! checks attached file extensions and blocks their launching if they are suspicious. The Bat! warns users of double extension attachments and allows users to see the real extension. The Bat!&#x27;s internal viewer was replaced in version 9.2.1 with the Chromium web browser rendering engine to ensure HTML formatting is properly rendered, prevent script execution, and provide anti-phishing information.

==== Database encryption ====
The Bat! Professional has the option to encrypt the message database, address books and configuration files stored on the computer. During the first program start, encryption can be activated and the master password can be set. The AES algorithm is used for encryption in the CBC process (Cipher Block Chaining) with a 128-bit key.

===Message management===
The Bat! provides virtual folders, advanced filtering, extensive search, a macro language, templates, tags, and color groups to assist in managing email.

Email templates contents may be dynamically changed through the use of macros, which can also be used to automatically execute other user-defined functions such as cursor positioning, addressing changes, identity changes, active account changes and other.

===Filtering===
A filtering system that sorts incoming, outgoing, read, and replied messages to folders; auto-responds; replies with custom templates; forwards, redirects, prints, or exports messages; sends read confirmations; runs external programs and more.

=== Language ===
Originally available in English, Russian, German, Polish and Dutch, the software interface has since been expanded to a total of 18 languages.

Support for IDNs that contain characters from non-Latin alphabets such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic and Greek. IDN support includes Latin alphabet-based characters with diacritics, such as those found in French and German.

=== Import function ===
The Bat! enables email import from the following programs and file formats:

* UNIX mailbox format (mbox)
* Outlook Express v4.xx, 5.xx, 6.0
* Microsoft 365/Office Outlook
* Mozilla Thunderbird
* Netscape Communicator v4.xx
* Netscape Mail v2.xx, 3.xx
* Eudora Lite/Pro
* Pegasus Mail

Address books can be imported in the following formats:

* Outlook Express (Windows Address Book)
* Microsoft 365/Office Outlook (Contacts Folder)
* Google Contacts
* LDIF files
* Electronic business cards (Vcard)
* Comma-separated text files (CSV)
* Tab-delimited text files (TAB)
* Initialization files (INI)
* Eudora Address Book
* Pegasus Tag File
* CardDAV address books

=== RSS aggregator ===
Other than email, The Bat! also has a built-in feed reader using RSS.

===Themes and customization===
In November 2020, with release of version 9.3 The Bat! introduced a number of themes to change its look and feel, also providing the ability for further color changes to the themes as provided. Toolbars and menus may also be modified, although doing that is difficult and not well documented.

==Reception==
The Bat! has gained popularity in some regions including Europe. Early reviews of The Bat! were largely positive: ZDNET in 1998 reviewed the first version and gave it 5 stars out of 5, saying &quot;The Bat! is friendly, powerful, functional and easy to learn&quot;. Zonia Heath of Shareware Junkies called it &quot;a very fast and effective email client&quot;. In 2000, TechByter.com also praised The Bat!, calling it an &quot;exceptional piece of work&quot; and noting the small 4 megabyte installation size. 

&quot;PCMag&quot; reviewing The Bat! 2.0 in 2004 gave a negative review. In 2005, the website DonationCoder.com awarded The Bat! the &quot;Best Email Client&quot;. &quot;Alphr&quot; praised the Professional version of The Bat! 3.6 with its security features. In 2011, Softpedia reviewed Professional version 5.0 and gave an &quot;Excellent&quot; rating of five out of five. &quot;PC World&quot; on the other hand gave the Professional version 2.5 stars out of five in 2012, commenting that it &quot;fails to deliver&quot;. 

GadgetSpeak.com gave The Bat! 8.0 four stars out of five in 2019.
