<text>Cúcuta (), officially San José de Cúcuta, is a Colombian municipality, capital of the department of Norte de Santander and nucleus of the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta. The city is located in the homonymous valley, at the foot of the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes, on the border with Venezuela. It comprises an area of approximately 1119 km2, with an urban area of 64 km2 (divided into 10 communes) and a rural area of 1055 km2 (divided into 10 townships). The city has a population of 777,106 inhabitants, which makes it the most populous municipality in the department and the sixth most populous municipality in the country. Similarly, its metropolitan area (made up of the municipalities of Villa del Rosario, Los Patios, El Zulia, San Cayetano and Puerto Santander) has an approximate population of 1,046,347.

The city was founded as a parish on June 17, 1733, by Juana Rangel de Cuéllar, resident of Pamplona in the area under the name of &quot;San José de Guasimales&quot;, as part of an initiative of the white and mestizo locals to separate themselves from the &quot;Indian Village of Cúcuta&quot; (currently San Luis Quarter). Later, the name was changed to San José de Cúcuta, castellanization of «Kuku-ta», in honor of the indigenous people of the region. From its foundation in the 18th century and throughout the Spanish viceroyalty, the parish was consolidated as one of the most important settlements of the Colombian East and Spanish America, receiving in 1792 the title of «Very Noble, Valiant and Loyal Village» by King Charles IV of Spain. 

The city is the political, economic, industrial, artistic, cultural, sports and tourist epicenter of Norte de Santander and constitutes, in turn, as the most important urban settlement of the Colombian-Venezuelan border along with the Venezuelan city of San Cristóbal, due to its trade dynamics and its historical importance in the consolidation of the modern states of Colombia and Venezuela as well as its diplomatic relations, hosting events such as the Battle of Cúcuta of 1813, the Congress of Cúcuta of 1821 in Villa del Rosario, in more recent times the signing of the 1941 Treaty of Limits between Colombia and Venezuela, the 1959 Treaty of Tonchalá, the charity concerts Peace Without Borders of 2008 and Venezuela Aid Live of 2019, among others. It also played a significant role during Colombian immigration to Venezuela and has recently become one of the most important transit points of the Venezuelan migration crisis.

As the capital of Norte de Santander, Cúcuta houses the main governmental bodies of departmental order such as the Government of Norte de Santander, the Assembly of Norte de Santander, the Superior Court of the Judicial District of Cúcuta, the Administrative Court of Norte de Santander and the regional branches of the Superior Council of the Judiciary and the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia. Cúcuta is connected by road with Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Valledupar, Cartagena de Indias and, by its border condition, with Venezuela. It has an air terminal, the Camilo Daza International Airport, and a ground terminal, the Central de Transportes de Cúcuta.

Its flagship university is the Francisco de Paula Santander University, one of the most important universities in eastern Colombia. It also has the presence of other universities of local and national renown such as the University of Pamplona, the FESC, the Free University of Colombia, the Simón Bolivar University, the University of Santander, the Saint Thomas University, among others.

==Etymology==
The city has a name composed in the manner of almost all the Spanish foundations in America: San José (one of the most widespread names in the continent thanks to the devotions of San José in Spain), honors Saint Joseph. The name of Cúcuta was taken in honor of the cacique Kuku-ta «Cúcuta in Spanish» and represents the Motilon-Bari indigenous people who inhabited the region before the conquest. Kuku-ta in the native language means &quot;House of the Goblin&quot;. The city was known as San José de Guasimales from 1733 to 1793, when it changed to its current name.

The coat of arms of the city has the legend that it says «Muy Noble, Valerosa y Leal Villa de San José de Cúcuta» &quot;Very Noble, Valiant and Loyal Village of San José de Cúcuta&quot;, title that was granted to him by means of royal card in just recognition to his laborious sons, shortly before the end of the century, by the King Charles IV of Spain. This was possible thanks to the help of the lawyer of the Royal Audience José María Maldona, who was in charge of legally presenting before the Viceroy José Manuel de Ezpeleta the presentation of the title of village on behalf of the inhabitants of the city.

The city has the nicknames &quot;The Pearl of the North, Gate of the Border, Green City, City of Trees, The Basketball Capital of Colombia&quot;.

== History ==

Cúcuta was originally a pre-hispanic settlement. It was entrusted to Sebastian Lorenzo by Pedro de Ursua as an encomienda in 1550. Juana Rangel de Cuellar founded Cúcuta on June 17, 1733, and donated a further . The village, centred on a church, grew considerably due to its strategic commercial location, and eventually became a city.

Several important events that forged Colombia as an independent republic took place in the city: one of these events was the Congress of 1821, where the Constitution of Cúcuta was written and approved. This constitution created Greater Colombia, a country embracing the present-day territories of Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama. The city preserves places where these historical events took place: the Historical Church of Cúcuta, the House of Santander, and the Park of Greater Colombia.

As the site of the Battle of Cúcuta (February 28, 1813), the city was the beginning of the Admirable Campaign led by Simón Bolívar. This campaign resulted in the independence of Venezuela.

===16th century: First European incursions===

The first European in the North Santander territories was the German conquistador Ambrosio Alfinger, who came from Santa Ana de Coro (Venezuela) in 1530 with a troop of adventurers, and invaded the unexplored eastern region of the newly created Governorate of Santa Marta.

Alfínger, in search of &quot;El Dorado&quot;, arrived in an area of indigenous settlements called Tamalameque along the Magdalena River, fighting and defeating several tribes. Alfinger was eventually killed in the outskirts of present-day Chinácota in a battle with Chimila and Chitarero. With Alfínger dead, Fedro St. Martin took command of the troops and returned to Coro, passing through the territory of Cúcuta.

In 1541, Hernán Pérez de Quesada reached the territory of Chinácota, but had to turn back the same year due to resistance by the indigenous people. Shortly thereafter, Alfonso Perez de Tolosa left El Tocuyo (Venezuela) and went to Salazar de Las Palmas, through Cúcuta, but also had to turn back after losing many soldiers in clashes with the natives.

In 1549, Spanish troops, commanded by Pedro de Ursúa and Ortún Velasco, invaded North Santander and reached the valley of Pamplona. In tribute to the Spanish city of Pamplona, the Spaniards founded the city of Pamplona. The new town soon attracted numerous people because of its agreeable climate, and gold mines that were discovered in the region. Further expeditions left this town and completed the conquest of the current territory of North Santander.

An expedition commanded by Diego de Montes founded the town of Salazar, but it was soon destroyed by the &quot;cacique&quot; Cínera. In 1583, the town was rebuilt by Alonso Esteban Rangel (great-grandfather of the founder of Cúcuta), on a site more appropriate for its defense in the event of new attacks by the natives.

The second expedition, commanded by Captain Francisco Fernández de Contreras, reached the lands of the Hacaritamas indigenous group and, on 26 July 1572, founded the city of Ocaña, calling it &quot;Santa Ana de Hacarí&quot;. Some of his colleagues named it New Madrid, and others Santa Ana of Ocaña. The next year, Antonio Orozco, a subaltern of Fernández, founded the town of Teorama, while the Augustinian Friars founded a convent in what is today the city of Chinácota.

===17th century: Foundation===

In the early 17th century a great part of the valley of Cúcuta belonged to Captain Christopher de Araque Ponce de Leon. The land passed through inheritance to his son Fernando Araque Ponce de Leon, who was the owner of the entire territory from the Valley of Cúcuta to the village of San Jose, the jurisdiction of the city of San Faustino. These fields had been donated to the older Araque by the Governor of the Province of New Mérida on 9 September 1630.

The resistance of the Motilones indigenous group towards the whites who were taking over and controlling the valley with economic ambitions was the key factor in the request for the establishment of a Catholic parish with the name &quot;San José.&quot; Juana Rangel de Cuéllar donated on June 17, 1733, for the construction of a church and land for Spanish families. Today, this area is the neighborhood of San Luis.

===19th century: Major events===

====Battle of Cúcuta====
The Battle of Cúcuta was one of the most important events of the Spanish American wars of independence, due to its role in the independence of Colombia and Venezuela. This battle was the beginning of the Admirable Campaign of Simón Bolívar. On February 28, 1813, Bolivar captured the city after a battle that lasted from 9:00 a.m. until early afternoon. About 400 men led by Bolivar fought 800 troops led by the Spanish general Ramon Correa. Bolivar&#x27;s forces reported losses of two killed and 14 injured, while the royalists are said to have suffered 20 killed and 40 injured. The victory freed the city of Cúcuta and led to the Admirable Campaign.

Colonel Simón Bolívar then launched a major offensive against the Spanish forces who were on the east bank of the Magdalena River and quickly achieved resounding victories. These led him to undertake a journey to liberate the Valley of Cúcuta held by the command of royalist Colonel Ramon Correa.

====Congress of Cúcuta====
On August 30, 1821, the Congress of Cúcuta took place at the town of Villa del Rosario (today part of Cúcuta) in the church known today as the &quot;Historic Temple of Cúcuta&quot;. The congress was established by Antonio Nariño and its participants included Francisco de Paula Santander, Simón Bolívar, and other leaders of Spanish America&#x27;s struggle for independence from Spain.

The main objective of this congress was to unify the territories of New Granada (Colombia and Panama) and Venezuela and thus create a huge state to be known as the Republic of Colombia (Gran Colombia). Ecuador subsequently joined Gran Colombia.

At 11 am on October 3, 1821, Simón Bolívar entered the meeting room in the sacristy of the church. He took a seat next to the president of Congress and was sworn in as president of the fledgling Republic of Colombia.

====Earthquake of Cúcuta====

On May 18, 1875, Cúcuta was largely destroyed by the earthquake of Cúcuta, also known as the &quot;Earthquake of the Andes&quot;. The earthquake occurred at 11:15 am; it destroyed Villa del Rosario, San Antonio del Tachira and Capacho, seriously damaged the Venezuelan settlements of San Cristóbal, La Mulata, Rubio, Michelena, La Grita and Colón (among others), and was felt in Bogotá and Caracas.

====Industrial Revolution====
In the 19th century, the construction of a railroad set off an Industrial Revolution in the city. The railroad had four branches: North, East, South and West. The North branch was constructed from 1878 to 1888, and connected Cúcuta with Puerto Santander and Venezuela. Construction of the Eastern and Southern branches began in 1878; the South branch linked with Pamplona, Colombia, and ended in El Diamante. The West branch was not built owing to economic problems. The railroad company fell into bankruptcy and was closed in 1960.

Many of the city&#x27;s historic buildings lie within the Park of Greater Colombia, including the House of Santander, the historic church, and the historic tamarind. All these are well preserved.

==Geography, climate and lay-out==

=== Geography ===
The city is in the eastern part of the Department of North Santander, in the Cordillera Oriental, close to the border with Venezuela. The city&#x27;s area is and its elevation is above sea level.

Rivers in Cúcuta and Norte de Santander include the Pamplonita River, Guaramito River, San Miguel River and Zulia River.

The Pamplonita River crosses the Norte de Santander Department.




=== Climate ===
Cúcuta has a tropical savanna climate, bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSh&quot;). The mean temperature is ; afternoon maximum temperatures are around . There is a sharp contrast between the wet season and the dry season. The driest months are January, February, June and July; the wettest are April, May, September, October and November. June and July usually however have frequent light precipitation and fog, whereas August is sunny and windy. The annual precipitation is around . Higher elevations near the city have cooler and wetter climates.

=== Layout ===

Cúcuta&#x27;s center, core of the city, is organized as a grid adopted from Spain in colonial times and reformed by Francisco Andrade Troconis after the devastating earthquake of 1875, with Santander Park as the guiding point. More than 300 neighborhoods form the urban network. Poorer neighborhoods are in the north, north-west and south-west, many of them squatter areas. The middle class lives mostly in the central and eastern areas.

==== Odonymy ====
Minor streets (&quot;Calles&quot;) run from east to west, perpendicular to the city&#x27;s western hills, whose numbering increases from north to south, starting from 1st Street. 

Major streets (&quot;avenidas&quot;), on the other hand, run from south to north parallel to the hills, starting from Zero Avenue. Avenues west of Zero Avenue increase their numbering from east to west, while those east of Zero Avenue increase their numbering from west to east, adding the indicative &quot;E&quot; (from &quot;Este&quot;, east) as well (for example, 1st Avenue E, 2nd Avenue E, etc.). 

== Symbols ==
===Flag===

The red and black North Santander Department flag was exhibited for the first time in 1928, when the first National Olympics were held in Cali. However, the flag of Cúcuta was not legalized until Mayor Carlos A. Rangel issued Decree 106 on May 3, 1988.

The black section represents the rich resources hidden beneath the territory, as well as the potential capability of the local people, whereas the red section represents the sacrifices of the independence heroes and the perseverance of the people in charge of reconstructing the city.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of Cúcuta was adopted on February 3, 1958, by Decree 032, after a request by the History Academy of North Santander. The shield is a classic shape, and carries the title conferred on the city by Royal Decree of the Emperor Carlos IV: &quot;Very noble, valiant and loyal town of San José of Cúcuta&quot;.

The upper part depicts the arms of the city&#x27;s founder Juana Rangel of Cuéllar, who donated lands for the foundation of the city on June 17, 1733. They are five silver and red fleur-de-lis in the shape of reels, on a golden background.

The lower part of the shield displays the arms that the National Congress adopted for Colombia by the Law of October 6, 1821, at its meeting in the Villa del Rosario. In the center are a quiver of spears, marked with X&#x27;s, and a set of bow and arrows, tied with tricolor tape. The spears represent attributes of the Roman consuls; the X is a symbol of the right of life or death; the bow and arrows are symbols of the pre-hispanic indigenous people.

===Anthem===
The anthem of Cúcuta was legalized by means of Decree 039 of February 8, 1984, by Mayor Luis Vicente Mountain Forest. The lyrics were written by Father Manuel Grillo Martínez, and the music by the master Pablo Tarazona Prada. It was chosen as the Anthem of Cúcuta by a unanimous vote in a contest held in the Theater Zulima.

==Demographics==

===Population===
The metropolitan area, which includes the municipalities of Villa del Rosario, Los Patios, El Zulia, San Cayetano, and Puerto Santander, has a combined population of more than 830,000 people. It is the largest metropolitan area in eastern Colombia and seventh in Colombia, behind Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, and Cartagena.

== Government ==

The current mayor of Cúcuta is Donamaris Ramírez-Paris Lobo, who was elected for the 2011–2015 period. He represented the Partido Verde and achieved approximately 43% of the votation or 98,588 votes.

The city is governed by the three branches of power: the executive power, represented by the Mayor and its departments; the legislative power, represented by the City Council; and the judicial power, which is formed by the tribunals and many other organisms of control. The Mayor is elected for a 4-year period and is in charge of electing each head of the administration departments. The city council is formed by 19 representatives elected by popular vote for four years. They approve or reject each decree issued by the mayor and make or correct laws regarding the city.

As the capital of Norte de Santander Department, Cúcuta houses the Department Hall and the City hall of the Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta, along with the Francisco de Paula Santander Justice Palace.

The city is divided into 10 localities (&quot;comunas&quot;). The Metropolitan Area of Cúcuta is formed by Cúcuta (as the main city), Villa del Rosario, Los Patios, San Cayetano, El Zulia, and Puerto Santander.

Politics in Cúcuta are not defined by a single political movement. Past rivals included the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Conservative Party. Today the political landscape is shared by many political parties, none commanding majority support.

==Economy==


The city is notable for bilateral trade and manufacturing. Its location on the border between Colombia and Venezuela has made possible strong links with the Venezuelan city of San Cristóbal, Táchira.

Its Free Zone is the most active of all those in the country and one of the most active in all Latin America, largely due to Venezuela being Colombia&#x27;s second largest trade partner.

The most developed industries are dairy, construction, textiles, shoes, and leather. The city is a top producer of cement and its clay and stoneware industry has the best reputation nationally for its high quality. The mining of coal also plays an important role in the local economy. The University Francisco de Paula Santander in Cucuta, the National University of Colombia in Bogotá, and the Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia in Tunja are the only ones in the country that provide for the career of Mining Engineering.

The peso is the official and sole legal tender currency in the city. Owing to its proximity to Venezuela, the bolívar was accepted by the vast majority of commercial establishments until the rapid devaluation of the Venezuelan currency began after the 2013 recession.

===US–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, implications for Cúcuta===

Colombia signed a Free Trade Agreement with the United States against opposition by Venezuela. Despite this opposition, industries from Venezuela are constructing their infrastructure in Cúcuta to export their products to the United States, registering their products as if they were Colombian, a strategy that allows them to export without paying certain tariffs. For that reason, Cúcuta is expected to become an industrial city.

Colombian law provides tax exemptions for Venezuelan imports through the &quot;Zona Franca&quot;, which, coupled with the motorway links between Cúcuta and Maracaibo, increases the possibility of exports from Maracaibo into Colombia.

==Telecommunications==
The city&#x27;s telecommunications services include payphones, WiMAX wireless networks, and mobile phone networks (GSM, CDMA, and TDMA).

Telecom Colombia offers the services of local, national, and international telephone and broadband ADSL Internet. There are three mobile telephone operators: Comcel, Movistar, and Tigo.

== Transport ==

For travel outside the city, there is a bus station called &quot;Terminal de Transportes&quot; (to be replaced by a new one), the Camilo Daza International Airport (Colombia) and the Juan Vicente Gómez International Airport (Venezuela). Eighty years ago the city had the &quot;Railroad of Cúcuta&quot;, which connected with Venezuela.

The main forms of public transportation are the bus (or collective) and taxicabs. In addition, National Planning has a project to build a mass transit system, under the name &quot;Metrobus&quot; (Cucuta).

The highway to Bucaramanga (renovated in January 2007) connects Cúcuta with Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali. The highway to Ocaña connects the city with Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Santa Marta, and the highway to San Cristóbal connects it with Caracas.

=== Bridges ===

The city has many bridges:
* San Rafael Bridge – the official name is &quot;Benito Hernández Bustos&quot;.

* Elías M. Soto Bridge – rebuilt and extended to 6 rails.
* San Luís Bridge – imported from England.
* Rafael García Herreros Bridge – part of the East Anillo Vial.

Six overpasses are under construction.

== Health ==

Law 100 of 1993 is the law governing Health in Colombia, which is regulated by the Ministry of Social Protection. In Cucuta and North Santander, health is administered by the Municipal Institute of Health (IMSALUD) and the local Department of Health, respectively. Entities such as the Colombian Red Cross, Colombian Civil Defense (for emergencies, calamities, and natural disasters) and the Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF), are part of the social protection system.

The city has the following public health institutions (or State Social Enterprises, ESE): ESE Erasmus University Hospital Meoz, the ESE Francisco de Paula Santander (Clinical Social Security), the ESE CardioNeuroPulmonar Rehabilitation Center, the ESE Hospital of Los Patios, and ESE Hospital of Villa del Rosario.

===Greenery===
Cúcuta has more green zones than many cities in Colombia. Some consider the city an &quot;urban lung&quot;, due to its greenery and lack of pollution. Cucuteños, and the legion of foreigners who reconstructed the city after the 1875 earthquake, led by engineer Francisco de Paula Andrade Troconis, led to the development of greenery in the city. The first planted trees were clemones. Soon they were replaced by acacias, peracos, and almond trees that adorned the parks and roadsides. An example of this city design is the Avenue of the Lights (based on oití, ficus, and cují), that forms a natural tunnel admired in the rest of the country and by tourists.

Palm trees are common in places such as Santander Park, Great Colombian Park, the Bank of the Republic, and the Department Hall of Norte de Santander.

== Heritage sites ==
Cúcuta has several important cultural sites such as the birthplace of Eduardo Cote Lamus, an influential person in the politics of Norte de Santander and the country during the first half of the twentieth century, this building was built in 1877. Another historical site of Cúcuta is the Casa Torre de Reloj, which served at the beginning as the Compañía Eléctrica del Norte (), and later as the House of Culture in addition to office of the Department&#x27;s Secretary of Culture. Another historic site is the Palacio de la Cúpula Chata, which is a building dating from 1919, part of the dome was shipped from New York City in June 1915. In 1989, part of the building was damaged by a fire, so in 1990, the project of reconstruction of the building was started based on the project of Maria Teresa Vela Viccini.

<text>Blanchardstown () is a large outer suburb of Dublin in the modern county of Fingal, Ireland. Located northwest of Dublin city centre, it has developed since the 1960s from a small village to a point where Greater Blanchardstown is the largest urban area in Fingal.

It is within the historical barony of Castleknock in the traditional County Dublin, as well as the Dublin 15 postal area and the Dublin West electoral constituency.

One of Ireland&#x27;s largest shopping and leisure complexes — the Blanchardstown Centre and adjacent facilities — is located in the area.

==Etymology==
The name Blanchardstown comes from the Blanchard family, who were granted their estate sometime between 1250 and 1260. The name &#x27;Blanchard&#x27; is thought to come from the old French word &#x27;blanch&#x27; meaning white, in turn potentially referring to white or fair hair.

==Geography==
Blanchardstown is just outside Dublin&#x27;s M50 motorway semi-ring road, slightly to the north of the tolled crossing of the River Liffey. The core of the suburb is the townland of the same name, containing the village and the Roselawn housing area. It is bordered to the east by the suburb of Castleknock, to the west by Coolmine, which includes some areas, including the Blanchardstown Centre and surrounding retail parks, central to the district, and Clonsilla/Ongar, to the north by Tyrellstown and Hollystown, and to the south and south-east by Porterstown and Diswellstown. The stretch of suburban housing from Castleknock Way north to the Old Navan Road and Talbot Court, including Laurel Lodge, has an ambiguous status - all of it is in the townland of Blanchardstown. The townland has an area of over 454 acres and is within the historical Barony of Castleknock.
The River Tolka, the second river of Fingal, and Dublin, runs through the centre of the area, meandering to run just north of the village core, and then further north to pass the Connolly Memorial Hospital and then Abbotstown.

The Royal Canal and the Dublin-Sligo railway line pass along the southern edge of Blanchardstown proper from east to west.

==History==

Blanchardstown was a predominantly rural area, with a small village, in western County Dublin, alongside the neighbouring district of Castleknock. Both areas shared a common history until well into the 19th century, when their development diverged. In &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland&quot;, published in 1837, Blanchardstown is described as &quot;a village [..] on the road to Navan, containing 57 houses and 342 inhabitants&quot;.

In the late 1960s, the first housing estates began to be developed. During the 1970s and 1980s, the village and surrounding housing developments became subsumed into the suburban fabric of Dublin.

The Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (ITB) was established in 1999 and, since amalgamation in 2019, is one of the three campuses of the new Technological University Dublin along with Grangegorman and Tallaght campuses.

During the late 1990s a criminal gang from Blanchardstown, known as &quot;The Westies”, controlled the heroin trade in west Dublin. One of its leaders was shot in a pub in Blanchardstown in 2003, while others were killed in Spain in 2004.

==Transport==

===Rail===
There are three Irish Rail railway stations in the wider Blanchardstown area: Castleknock, Coolmine and Clonsilla. Trains on the Maynooth/Longford line connect the city centre, at Dublin Connolly, Tara Street and Dublin Pearse stations, to Maynooth, Longford and Sligo. At Clonsilla station, the Dublin–Navan railway line connects Docklands railway station to Hansfield and Dunboyne.

===Bus===
Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland routes include 37, 38, 38A, 38B, 38D, 39, 39A, 40D, 70, 76A, 220, 236, 236A, 238, 270, L52, N4 and W4. Route 39A operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week.

Nitelink bus route 70N also operates on Friday and Saturday nights to Dunboyne.
Express bus routes include service from Aston Quay and from Coolmine Railway Station to Ballycoolin Industrial Estate.

Ballycoolin Industrial Estate is served by a private bus company called AMC Ballycoolin, also known as Express Bus.

Bus Éireann services pass through Blanchardstown on routes 105, 109 and 111.

==Amenities==

Connolly Hospital, one of Dublin&#x27;s main hospitals, and a public university teaching hospital, is located in the area, as is the Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown.

Local retail outlets include Blanchardstown Centre (a large retail shopping centre with over 180 stores), and WestEnd Shopping Park (a retail park located beside the Blanchardstown Centre). The Crowne Plaza Hotel, northwest of the village, is located by the Blanchardstown Centre complex. There is a SuperValu outlet on Main Street.

Blanchardstown has a large public library and is also home to the Draíocht Arts Centre.

There is a large Garda station on Blanchardstown&#x27;s main street.

== Education==

There are a number of primary schools (national schools) in Blanchardstown, including Scoil Bhríde (Cailiní) and Scoil Bhríde (Buacaillí) on Church Avenue, Sacred Heart of Jesus Primary School (Huntstown), Scoile Olilibheir (Coolmine), St Ciaran&#x27;s Primary School (Hartstown), Mary Mother of Hope Primary School (Clonee), and St Phillip the Apostle Primary School (Mountview).

Second-level schools (secondary schools) serving the area include Blakestown Community School, Rath Dara Community College, Hartstown Community School, and Coolmine Community School.
The Institute of Technology, Blanchardstown (part of TU Dublin) is a third-level institution with a campus on Blanchardstown Road.

==Sport==
The National Sports Campus is located in Blanchardstown and includes the National Aquatic Centre, a major indoor aquatics facility with a 50m swimming pool, diving pool, leisure pool and aquapark, and fitness centre. The centre hosted the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games and a number of international swimming events since then.

There are several GAA clubs in the Blanchardstown area, including St. Brigids, Castleknock and St. Peregrines, Clonsilla. There are also a number of association football (soccer) clubs in the area, including St. Mochta’s.

==Religion==
St Brigid&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church is situated behind Main Street at Church Avenue. The foundation stone for the church was laid on 13 October 1835 and the first Mass was celebrated there on 29 October 1837. The construction of the Church and its unusual Flemish spire was finally completed in 1863.

In the 19th century, the Roman Catholic parish of Blanchardstown encompassed much of the area now within the Dublin 15 postal district; some of the component areas were quite distinct from Blanchardstown but Catholic parishes had been merged during Penal Laws times. Following the relaxation of the Penal Laws, it became possible for Catholic adherents to consider the construction of additional churches and to repair the existing stock of religious buildings. Church authorities used the opportunity to implement the Tridentine reform which saw the parish as the basic unit of ecclesiastical organisation and the parish priest as the central figure within the parish.

The new parish priest of Blanchardstown in 1839, Fr Michael Dungan, oversaw the construction of a number of new churches, which today serve independent parishes, and invited a number of religious communities to provide for the education of Catholic children. St Brigid&#x27;s Church, Blanchardstown – not to be confused with a church of the Church of Ireland in nearby Castleknock – was constructed in 1837 upon the foundation of a church that had been built prior to 1731. It is the mother church of 12 other churches constituted out of the parish over the following 156 years. 
* Chapelizod - &quot;Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; (separated from Blanchardstown Parish 1883)
** Navan Road - &quot;Our Lady Help of Christians&quot; (separated from Chapelizod 1953)
* Castleknock - &quot;Our Lady Mother of the Church&quot; (separated from Blanchardstown 1976)
** Laurel Lodge / Carpenterstown - &quot;St Thomas, the Apostle&quot; (separated from Castleknock 1983)
* Porterstown - &quot;St Mochta&#x27;s&quot; (separated from Castleknock 1986. The present church was constructed in 1890 as a Chapel of ease for Blanchardstown.)
* Corduff - &quot;St Patrick&#x27;s Church&quot; (separated from Blanchardstown 1976)
** Mountview - &quot;St Philip, the Apostle&quot; (separated from Corduff 1979)
** Blakestown - &quot;Church of Mary of the Servants&quot; (separated from Corduff 1979)

* Hartstown - &quot;St Ciarán&#x27; Church&quot; (separated Blanchardstown 1979)
* Mulhuddart / Lady&#x27;s Well - &quot;St Luke, the Evangelist&quot; (separated from Blanchardstown 1993)

<text>Tallaght ( ; , ) is a southwestern outer suburb of Dublin, Ireland. The central village area was the site of a monastic settlement from at least the 8th century, which became one of medieval Ireland&#x27;s more important monastic centres.

Up to the 1960s, Tallaght was a small village in the old County Dublin, linked to several nearby rural areas which were part of the large civil parish of the same name—the local council estimates the population then to be 2,500. Suburban development began in the 1970s and a &quot;town centre&quot; area has been developing since the late 1980s. There is no legal definition of the boundaries of Tallaght, but the 13 electoral divisions known as &quot;Tallaght&quot; followed by the name of a locality have, according to the 2022 census, a population of 81,022, up from 76,119 over six years. This makes Tallaght the largest settlement on the island without city status, however there have been calls in recent years for it to be declared one.

The village core of the district is located north of, and near to, the River Dodder, and parts of the broader area within South Dublin are close to the borders of Dublin City, County Kildare, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and County Wicklow. Several streams flow in the area, notably the Jobstown or Tallaght Stream (a tributary of the Dodder), and the Fettercairn Stream (a tributary of the River Camac), while the Tymon River, the main component of the River Poddle (Liffey tributary), rises in Cookstown, near Fettercairn.

Tallaght is also the name of an extensive civil parish, which includes other areas of southern and southwestern Dublin, from Templeogue to Ballinascorney in the mountains. A book about the civil parish was published in the 19th century, &quot;The History and Antiquities of Tallaght in the County of Dublin&quot;, written by William Domville Handcock.

==Etymology==
The place-name &quot;Tallaght&quot; is said to derive from &quot;támh-leacht&quot;, meaning &quot;plague pit&quot; in Irish, and consisting of &quot;támh&quot;, meaning plague, and &quot;leacht&quot;, meaning grave or memorial stone. The earliest mention of a Tallaght is in &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (&quot;The Book Of Invasions&quot;), and is there linked to Parthalón, said to be the leader of an early invasion of Ireland. He and many of his followers were said to have died of the plague. The burials that have been found in the Tallaght area, however, are all normal pre-historic interments, mainly from the Bronze Age, and nothing suggesting a mass grave has so far been recorded here. The Annals of the Four Masters record the legendary event as follows:
: Naoi mile do ecc fri h-aoin-sechtmain do muinter Parthaloin for Shenmhaigh Ealta Eadoir .i. cúig míle d&#x27;feroibh, &amp; ceithre míle do mnáibh. Conadh de sin ata Taimhleacht Muintere Parthalain. Trí ced bliadhain ro caithsiot i n-Erinn.&quot;

In translation:
: &quot;Nine thousand of Parthalón&#x27;s people died in one week on Sean Mhagh Ealta Edair, namely, five thousand men, and four thousand women. Whence is named Taimhleacht Muintire Parthalóin. They had passed three hundred years in Ireland.&quot;

The name in Irish, Tamhlacht, is found at other places, such as Tamlaght in Magherafelt District, Northern Ireland, though the mention of Eadoir, probably Binn Éadair (Howth) in the passage below, suggests that Tallaght is the more likely location for this tale.

Places near Tallaght featured in the ancient legends of the Fianna, a band of warriors that roamed the country and fought for the High King at Tara. In Lady Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Gods and Fighting Men&quot;, mention is made of, in particular, Gleann na Smól: in Chapter 12 &quot;The Red Woman&quot;, on a misty morning, Fionn says to his Fians, &quot;Make yourselves ready, and we will go hunting to Gleann-na-Smol&quot;. There they meet Niamh of the Golden Hair, who chose Oisín from among all the Fianna to be her husband, told him to come with her on her fairy horse, after which they rode over the land to the sea and across the waves to the land of Tír na nÓg.

== History ==

===8th to 12th centuries===
With the foundation of the monastery of Tallaght by St. Maelruain in AD 769, there is a more reliable record of the area&#x27;s early history. The monastery was a centre of learning and piety, particularly associated with the Céli Dé spiritual reform movement. It was such an important institution that it and the monastery at Finglas were known as the &quot;two eyes of Ireland&quot;. St. Aengus, an Ulsterman, was one of the most illustrious of the Céli Dé and devoted himself to the religious life. Wherever he went, he was accompanied by a band of followers who distracted him from his devotions. He secretly travelled to the monastery at Tallaght where he was not known and enrolled as a lay brother. He remained unknown for many years until his identity was discovered by Maeilruain. They may have written the &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot; together, and St Aengus also wrote a calendar of saints known as the &quot;Félire Óengusso&quot; (&quot;Martyrology of Aengus&quot;). St. Maelruain died on 7 July 792 and was buried in Tallaght. The influence of the monastery continued after his death, as can be judged by the fact that, in 806, the monks of Tallaght were able to prevent the holding of the Tailteann Games, because of some infringement of their rights. 

In AD 811, the monastery was devastated by the Vikings but the destruction was not permanent and the annals of the monastery continued to be recorded for several following centuries. After the Anglo-Norman invasion in 1179, Tallaght and its appurtenances were confirmed to the Diocese of Dublin and became the property of the Archbishop. The complete disappearance of every trace of what must have been an extensive and well-organised monastic settlement can only be accounted for by the subsequent history of the place, the erection and demolition of defensive walls and castles, and the incessant warfare and destruction that lasted for hundreds of years.

===13th to 20th centuries===
Throughout the greater part of the 13th century a state of comparative peace existed at Tallaght, but subsequently, the O&#x27;Byrnes and O&#x27;Tooles, in what would become County Wicklow, took offensive action and were joined by many of the Archbishop&#x27;s tenants. As a result of this the land was not tilled, the pastures were not stocked and the holdings were deserted. In 1310 the bailiffs of Tallaght got a royal grant to enclose the town. No trace of these defensive walls survive and there is no evidence of their exact location, except, perhaps, for the name of the Watergate Bridge which spans the Dodder on the Oldbawn Road. The continuation of such raids prompted the construction, in 1324, of Tallaght Castle, and it was finished sometime before 1349. Tallaght had become an important defensive site on the edge of the Pale. A century later the castle was reported to be in need of repair.

The 17th and 18th centuries brought many changes to Tallaght. Many mills were built along the Dodder and this brought new prosperity to the broad area, which saw the building of many houses.

When Archbishop Hoadley replaced Archbishop King in 1729 he found the castle in ruins and had it demolished, building himself a palace at a cost of £2,500. By 1821 the palace too had fallen into ruin and an Act of Parliament was passed which stated that it was unfit for habitation. The following year it was sold to Major Palmer, Inspector General of Prisons, who pulled the palace down and used the materials to build his mansion, Tallaght House, as well as a schoolhouse and several cottages. Parts of Tallaght House, including one tower, were incorporated into St Joseph&#x27;s Retreat House, situated on the grounds of St Mary&#x27;s Priory; the rest was demolished. That tower contains a spiral staircase and was originally four storeys high but is now reduced internally to two. Attached to the castle was a long building that was used in the archbishop&#x27;s time as a brewery and later as a granary and stables. When the Dominicans came, it was converted into a chapel and was used as such until 1883, when the new church dedicated to Fr Tom Burke (now the older part of the parish church) was built.

The Dominicans came to Tallaght in 1855/6 and soon established a priory that was also a seminary for the formation of Dominicans in Ireland and on missions in Trinidad and Tobago, South America, Australia, India, and elsewhere. The cramped accommodation of Tallaght house was replaced by the austere priory in phases of 1864, 1903 and again in 1957. The work that goes on in these buildings is various: St Joseph&#x27;s retreat house, the Tallaght parish, St Catherine&#x27;s counselling centre, at least two publishing enterprises, individual writing and international research in several domains.

The grounds of the Priory, the old palace gardens, still retain older features such as the Archbishop&#x27;s bathhouse, the Friar&#x27;s Walk and St. Maelruain&#x27;s Tree, a Persian walnut of the eighteenth century.

The old constabulary barracks on the main street were the scene of the engagement known as the &#x27;Battle of Tallaght&#x27;, which occurred during the Fenian Rising on 5 March 1867. On that night the Fenians moved out to assemble at the appointed place on Tallaght Hill. The large number of armed men alarmed the police in Tallaght who sent a warning to the nearest barracks. There were fourteen constables and a head constable under Sub-inspector Burke at Tallaght, and they took up a position outside the barracks where they commanded the roads from both Greenhills and Templeogue. The first body of armed men came from Greenhills and, when they came under police fire, retreated. Next, a party came from Templeogue and was also dispersed. In 1936 a skeleton, sword-bayonet and water bottle were found in a hollow tree stump near Terenure. It is thought that these were the remains of one of the Fenians who had taken refuge there after the Battle of Tallaght and either died of his wounds or was frozen to death.
In 1888 the Dublin and Blessington Steam Tramway opened and it passed through Tallaght Village. This provided a new means of transporting goods and also brought day-trippers from the city.

=== Modern development ===

While no plan was formally adopted, Tallaght was laid out as a new town, as set out in the 1967 Myles Wright masterplan for Greater Dublin (this proposed four self-contained &quot;new towns&quot; - at Tallaght, Clondalkin, Lucan and Blanchardstown - around Dublin, all of which were, at that time, villages surrounded by extensive open lands, with some small settlements). Many of the social and cultural proposals in this plan were ignored by the Dublin local authorities, and contrary to planners&#x27; suggestions, Tallaght and the other &quot;new towns&quot; were not provided with adequate facilities. Characterised by the same problems associated with poorly planned fringe areas of many European cities, during the 1970s and 1980s Tallaght became synonymous with suburban mismanagement.

While it was absorbed into the larger suburban area of Dublin (including being included in the postal district Dublin 24 in the 1980s), Tallaght has developed a distinctive identity, arising largely from its rapid growth during recent decades, and now has active local arts, cultural, sports, and economic scene.

Tallaght&#x27;s Civic Square contains the seat of the local authority, County Hall, a modern and well-equipped library facility, a theatre building and a &quot;cutting edge&quot; 4-storey arts centre named &quot;Rua Red&quot; (which opened on 5 February 2009). This facility offers activities in the areas of music, dancing, art, drama and literature. Along with other local libraries and arts groups, it also has another theatre building and a homegrown youth theatre company. It is also the home to the Tallaght Swim Team, Tallaght Rugby Club, the National Basketball Arena, Shamrock Rovers F.C., and several martial arts schools and Gaelic Athletic Association clubs.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Tallaght is centred 13 km southwest of Dublin city, near the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains. While there is no formal definition as such, it can be described as beginning southwest of Templeogue, running west towards Saggart, southwest towards the mountain areas of Bohernabreena, Glenasmole and Brittas, southeast towards Firhouse, and to the southern edges of Clondalkin in the northwest and Greenhills in the northeast. It lies outside the M50 Dublin orbital motorway, and in effect forms an irregular circle on either side of the N81 Dublin-Blessington road. The suburban villages of Saggart and Rathcoole, and the Citywest campus, with growing amounts of housing, lie west of Tallaght, along with the Air Corps aerodrome at Baldonnel. There is also still considerable open land, some still actively farmed, in this direction.

The village core of the district is located north of, and near to, the River Dodder, and several streams flow in the area. The Jobstown Stream or Tallaght Stream (a tributary of the Dodder), approaches from the west, and takes in at least one tributary, the Killinarden Stream from the south, near the N81. The Fettercairn Stream (a tributary of the River Camac), also passes through the northwest fringes of the area, while the Tymon River, the main component of the River Poddle (an historically important Liffey tributary), rises in Cookstown, near Fettercairn.

===Transport===

Tallaght is connected to Dublin city by bus services and by the Red Line of the Luas light rail system, which opened in September 2004. Though the first stop (Tallaght Cross) of the Red Line is called &quot;Tallaght&quot;, most of the &#x27;Red 4&#x27; zone (with the exception of the stops at Citywest Campus, Fortunestown and the terminus at Saggart) lies within the broader Tallaght area. The other stops that serve Tallaght include Belgard (which is the last stop before the junction), Fettercairn, Cheeverstown, Cookstown and Hospital. As of 2013, a single ticket from Red 4 to Central 1 was €2.70.

Tallaght is not well connected to Dublin&#x27;s other towns and suburbs, as public transport lines predominantly run through the city centre; this has led to high levels of car dependence. However the 76 bus route links Tallaght to Clondalkin, Liffey Valley Shopping Centre and Ballyfermot, while the S8 connects to Citywest, Rathfarnham, Ballinteer, Dundrum, Sandyford, Leopardstown, Stillorgan, Monkstown and Dún Laoghaire, and the S6 connects with Templeogue, Dundrum and UCD and Blackrock. According to a 2019 consultation paper for the BusConnects project, Tallaght would be establish as a public transport hub for surrounding villages and suburbs.

Routes to the city centre include the 27 (via Jobstown and Tymon Park), 49 (The Square, Aylesbury, Oldbawn, Ballycullen and Firhouse), 54a (Kiltipper, Killinarden Heights, The Square, Tallaght Hospital, Tallaght Village, Balrothery), 56a (The Square, Springfield, Fettercairn and Kingswood), 65 (The Square, Tallaght Hospital, Tallaght Village and Balrothery), 65b (Killinarden Heights, Kiltipper Road, Aylesbury, Old Bawn, Firhouse and Ballycullen) and 77a (Blessington, Killinarden Heights, The Square, Tallaght Hospital, Tallaght Village, Oldbawn, Balrothery and Tymon Park).

Former routes include the 75 (The Square, Rathfarnham, Ballinteer, Dundrum, Stillorgan, and Dún Laoghaire) and 175 (Citywest, Dundrum and UCD). Since 26 November 2023, they have been withdrawn and largely replaced with the brand new S6 and S8 routes.

A metro rail line, Metro West, was proposed to pass through Tallaght but was shelved in 2011. Early plans for the line proposed to link Tallaght with several satellite towns west of Dublin city, including Clondalkin, Lucan, and Blanchardstown. If completed as proposed it would also join with Metrolink and continue out to Dublin Airport. The first 4 stops of the proposed Metro West were to be in Tallaght, with the first stop, &#x27;Tallaght East&#x27; being situated near Tallaght IT, now the Tallaght Campus of Technological University Dublin.

A Luas extension from Belgard to Saggart and Citywest was added to the original Luas system. This is a 4.2 km (2.5 mi) extension, funded by a Public-Private Partnership with property developers, including Davy Hickey Properties. Identified as Line A1, this €150 million spur off the Red Line at Belgard runs to Saggart. Originally intended to be a spur of the proposed Red Line as far as Fortunestown, it was later decided to extend it to Saggart. Construction started on 9 February 2009, with the line completed by early 2011. Passenger services on the 4.2 km light rail link started in early 2011. It serves housing developments such as Cairnwood, Ambervale, Belgard Green, Fettercairn, Kilmartin, Brookview, Ardmore, Citywest and Russell Square.

=== Population ===
South Dublin County Council stated in 2003 that the population of Tallaght &quot;and environs&quot; was just under 73,000. Tallaght is the seat of South Dublin County Council and has no specific local administration. In addition, while there exist two distinct local electoral areas in the form of &quot;Tallaght Central&quot; (based around the historic village core and key modern developments) and &quot;Tallaght South&quot; (the outlying &quot;suburbs&quot; and some rural areas), Tallaght possesses no legal boundary and as a result, it is very difficult to define an official population figure for the area. The population of the village remains modest but the broader area is now one of Ireland&#x27;s largest population agglomerations. If the entirety of Tallaght and its broadly defined environs were taken into account, then the population would be greater than that of Galway City (75,414), rendering Tallaght the fourth largest area by population in the state. Irish population statistics are calculated from District Electoral Divisions, and these are often combined to estimate &quot;area populations&quot;. As of the 2016 census, the total population of the area was 76,119.


The population of the historic &quot;civil parish of Tallaght&quot;, including areas such as Templeogue, Ballyroan, and wide areas of mountain as far away as Castlekelly, is 101,059.

=== Districts ===

&quot;Greater Tallaght&quot; comprises Tallaght village and a range of areas that were formerly small settlements (Jobstown, Old Bawn, Kilnamanagh) and rural townlands.

The original village of Tallaght lies west of the Tallaght Bypass (N81). It stretches east–west from Main Road and Main Street to the Abberley Court Hotel at the end of High Street and encompasses the Village Green shopping plaza, Tallaght Courthouse, Westpark, and many shops, and restaurants and banks. It also houses Tallaght Youth Service, Tallaght&#x27;s first newspaper printing house the Tallaght Echo, and (formally) Tallaght Community Arts Centre. The area&#x27;s Institute of Technology, Saint Mary&#x27;s Priory, and Saint Maelruain&#x27;s Church are located in the historic quarter of Tallaght village.

Tallaght has a vibrant and intergenerational network of urban Irish speakers. This is supported by Gaelphobal Thamhlachta, a cultural association which grew out of Cumann Gaelach Thamhlachta, founded in 1974 as a branch of the Gaelic League.

Particular emphasis has been placed on providing education through Irish. There are now three Gaelscoileanna (Irish-speaking primary schools), Scoil Santain (founded in 1979), Scoil Chaitlín Maude (founded in 1986) (Caitlín Maude, after whom the latter is named, was a well-known Irish-language poet, singer and activist who settled in the area), as well as Scoil na Giúise founded in 2012. There is also an Irish-medium secondary school, Coláiste de hÍde.

The importance of the language was given official recognition in 2015 with the announcement of a €50,000 council grant to Gaelphobal Thamhlachta, supplemented by a government grant of €150,000 in 2016, meant to facilitate the creation of a local Irish-language cultural centre, including a public cafe staffed by local Irish speakers. A further €30,000 was granted by South Dublin County Council in 2019 to help develop a theatre as part of a cultural centre at 518 Tallaght Village.

However, the flag was ultimately not flown and instead, its colours were utilised within aspects of the performance.

The flag developed into &quot;An Bhratach Seasmhacht&quot;, or &quot;The Endurance Flag&quot;, which was flown from The Cabin at the Fettercairn Community Centre for 12 months, as part of Tallaght Community Arts &#x27;Headin&#x27; Out Project&#x27; between 2013 and 2014.

=== The Tallaght Unity Flag ===

Designed by Seos Ó Colla and launched in August 2017 after a decade of development by the Tallaght Historical Society, &quot;An Bratach Aontacht Thamlachta&quot; or &quot;The Tallaght Unity Flag&quot; has been adopted as a flag for Tallaght by both the Tallaght Historical Society and the Tallaght Community Council. The flag was first flown publicly from a flagpole at the Priory in Tallaght village during Tallafest 2017. Since Easter 2018, it has also been displayed at the Dragon Inn, and as of August 2018, it is also flown at Molloy&#x27;s The Foxes Covert, a pub in Tallaght village.

In September 2017, The Tallaght Unity Flag was presented to Bridie Sweeney, the first ever Tallaght Person of the Year and a dedicated volunteer at the Vincent&#x27;s shop in Tallaght Village, in recognition of her extensive community work. Bridie, honored in 1984 during the inaugural Tallaght Person of the Year awards, was acknowledged by the Tallaght Community Council for her enduring energy and commitment to volunteering. Tara De Buitléar, TCC’s volunteer PRO, highlighted Bridie&#x27;s continuous community focus and her significant role at St Vincent de Paul. The flag is intended as a symbol of Tallaght’s identity and community spirit. It is now displayed proudly in Vincent’s shop, joining many local businesses and groups that embrace and fly the Tallaght flag with pride.

==== Description ====

The green triangle in the lower left corner represents the lush landscapes and natural beauty of Tallaght, a color historically associated with Ireland, signifying growth and harmony. The flag also includes three blue, eight-pointed stars on the right side, inspired by the design captured during the Battle of Tallaght in 1867, representing endurance and the historical struggles of the community, with blue emphasising inclusivity and unity. The white background provides a neutral canvas, symbolising peace and unity, reflecting the community’s aspirations for harmony and collaboration.

<text>The Grantham Canal ran 33 miles (53 km) from Grantham through 18 locks to West Bridgford, where it joined the River Trent. It was built primarily for the transportation of coal to Grantham. It opened in 1797 and its profitability steadily increased until 1841. It was then sold to a railway company, declined, and was finally closed in 1936. It was used as a water supply for agriculture, and so most of it remained in water after closure, although bridges were lowered. Since the 1970s, the Grantham Canal Society have been working to restore parts of it. Two stretches are now navigable to small vessels. A new route will be required where the canal joins the Trent, as road building has severed the original one.

==History==

The concept of a canal from the River Trent to Grantham was first raised on 27 August 1791, as a way of supplying the district with cheaper coal. The intent was for the navigation to join the Trent below Nottingham at Radcliffe-on-Trent. As William Jessop was surveying the Nottingham Canal at the time, he was asked to survey the Grantham route as well, and a bill was put before Parliament in 1792. It was defeated, as there was opposition from coal suppliers, who delivered coal by road to Grantham, and from those who thought that the River Witham would be damaged by the project. A revised route was developed, with the junction now at West Bridgford, and an additional branch to Bingham. A second bill was put forward and the act of Parliament, the (33 Geo. 3. c. 94), received royal assent on 30 April 1793. Building work on the canal started in 1793, with Jessop in overall charge, but with James Green and William King as resident engineers: Green, who was from Wollaton, was appointed engineer for the section of canal from the Trent to the Leicestershire border, while King, who was the agent for the Duke of Rutland, was responsible for the rest of the canal, including two reservoirs, one at Denton and the other at Knipton on the River Devon.
The act authorised an initial £75,000 to be raised to pay for construction, together with an option to raise a further £30,000, of which £20,000 should be raised by shares of £100 each among the initial subscribers, and £10,000 by mortgaging the future income of the canal. However, this amount proved insufficient, and there was also disagreement between the shareholders as to their liability to raise the additional £20,000. As a result, a second act of Parliament was sought. This received royal assent as the (37 Geo. 3. c. 30) on 3 March 1797, and made clear the obligations of existing shareholders to pay the extra subscription, and also authorised an additional £24,000 to be raised. The second act also removed restrictions in the first act, and allowed the company to set whatever rates it chose for using the canal.

The eastern section from the Leicestershire border was opened on 1 February 1797, with the rest of the canal later that year. The canal was built with locks , the same size as those on the Nottingham Canal to allow boats to use both. The branch to Bingham authorised by the first act of Parliament was not built. The 18 locks raised the level of the canal by from the Trent to Grantham. Eleven of them were in the first above the Trent, after which there was a level pound of around before a flight of seven locks at Woolsthorpe, and a much shorter upper pound to Grantham. At Harlaxton, the canal passed through a deep cutting (effectively crossing the watershed between the River Witham and the River Trent), which was only wide enough for a single boat, but this situation was partially rectified in 1801 when the cutting was widened in two places to allow boats travelling on opposite directions to cross. At Cropwell Bishop and Cropwell Butler, the route passed through gypsum beds, which resulted in problems with leakage.

===Operation===
The canal made sufficient money to repay substantial debts in 1804 and 1805, after which dividends were paid to the shareholders, beginning at 2 per cent in 1806, rising to 5 per cent in 1815, and reaching their highest level of 8.6 per cent in 1839. The tolls brought in an income which remained below £9,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach £13,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, groceries and building materials. Some of it supplied villages along the line of the canal, and some of that which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham. Downward traffic was largely agricultural produce, including corn, beans, malt and wool. Such produce was normally loaded at Grantham or Harby.

Initially, some of the coal carried on the canal had been transported in boats owned by the canal company, but they had given up this practice in 1812. They resumed carrying coal in 1827, because they felt that coal stocks at Grantham were not adequate, but were accused of price-fixing. Although the penalty imposed by Lincoln Assizes was small, they ceased this trade, and the coal merchants agreed to maintain stocks of 2,660 tons at Grantham. In 1833, J. Rofe and his son made a proposal for a canal to connect Grantham and Sleaford, but this was not pursued.

===Decline===
In common with most canals, competition from railways posed a major threat, and in 1845 the canal owners agreed to sell it to the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway when their line from Ambergate to Grantham was opened. Although the railway was completed in 1850, the railway company did not honour the agreement. The canal company brought a large number of cases against the railway company, and successfully opposed several bills which the railway were trying to get passed in Parliament. Eventually the railway company agreed to pay, and shareholders received £45 per share in cash, with the balance being in railway mortgages. The agreement was reached on 1 June 1854, and the transfer of ownership took place on 20 December. Railway mergers meant that the canal came under the control of the Great Northern Railway in 1861, and later the London and North Eastern Railway.

Traffic declined as the railway companies neglected the canal, and were down to 18,802 tons in 1905, on which the tolls amounted to £242 and the London and North Eastern Railway (General Powers) Act 1936 (26 Geo. 5 &amp; 1 Edw. 8. c. cxxvii) formally closed the canal, though there had been no boat traffic since 1929. The closure act stipulated that water levels should be maintained at to support agricultural needs. This effectively guaranteed the continued existence of the canal channel, but structures such as locks and bridges deteriorated, and in the 1950s 46 of the 69 bridges over the canal were lowered as part of road improvement schemes. Although the low bridges act as barriers to navigation, large parts of the canal are still in water.

In 1948 Britain&#x27;s railways, and hence the canal, were nationalised, and became the responsibility of the British Transport Commission. In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways. Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968, all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial, cruising or remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future, and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues. The Grantham Canal was listed in this latter category.

==Restoration==
A plan to fill in a section of the canal in Nottingham resulted in a number of letters appearing in the local press in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report on the state of the canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of Parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a new link to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.

Together with British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association and the Waterway Recovery Group, the society began the work of restoration of the canal to navigation, a process which is still ongoing. A major development was the granting of permission in 1992 to remove an old railway embankment, which blocked the route near the top of the Woolsthorpe flight of locks. The task was completed by a number of Waterway Recovery Group workcamps. New gates were fitted to the top three locks, and rebuilding of Casthorpe bridge was funded by Lincolnshire County Council, opening up of the canal for navigation. Further down the canal, restoration of a section between Hickling Basin and Hose was funded by a derelict land grant of £400,000, received in 1993. The Grantham Canal Partnership was formed in 1997, as a way to take the project forwards. It consisted of representatives from each of the six local authorities through which the route passes, British Waterways, the Inland Waterways Association, the Grantham Canal Restoration Society and the Grantham Navigation Association, a group which had split off from the Canal Society in 1992. As a result of the co-operation, British Waterways formulated a draft business plan for the canal.

Following the restoration of the top three locks at Woolsthorpe in the 1990s, a 10-mile (16-km) section from the A1 to Redmile will be completed once the bottom four locks of the flight are restored. The rebuilding of locks 6 and 7, completed in 2000, brought the number of locks restored to five, and approximately one quarter of the canal has been restored to navigable standard. Much improvement of the towpath has also taken place, and access to it is possible at most of the bridges.

A major setback occurred in 2007, when one of the walls of Woolsthorpe Top Lock had to be propped to prevent it collapsing, and British Waterways took the decision to fill it in, as funding was not available to rebuild it. The Inland Waterways Association received a legacy of £100,000 from the estate of Fredrick Woodman, designated for the Grantham Canal, but British Waterways ruled that no work could start until the whole cost of £175,000 had been found. The balance was made up by grants of £40,000 from Lincolnshire County Council and £35,000 from the East Midlands Development Agency. The wall was demolished and rebuilt in three sections, utilizing of concrete and 7,500 new bricks.

The Canal and River Trust applied for a Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) grant to cover the costs of rebuilding locks 12 to 15 of the Woolsthorpe flight using volunteers. A visit by the Heritage Lottery Fund in November 2014 resulted in a grant of £830,000, to cover reconstruction of locks 14 and 15, which was match funded by money from the Canal and River Trust and from Grantham Canal Society. Work began in August 2015, and was completed by July 2018, with an official opening taking place on 13 September 2019. The Society were assisted by the Waterway Recovery Group, and because of the HLF funding, the project included training of their own volunteers in the skills needed to build locks. This enabled them to begin restoring lock 13 in 2024, the next in the flight, without the need to involve outside labour. The restoration is expected to take about two years and cost around £250,000.
Restoration of most of the canal does not present major problems, but challenges are presented by the final sections at both ends. The original route to join the Trent has been severed by the building of the A52 road. A route was identified which followed the course of the Polser Brook, which passes under the A52 to the north of the canal, but by 2009, three possible solutions were under consideration. These pose additional problems in finding funding, since they do not count as restoration, and many of the traditional funding sources are not then available. At Grantham, an embankment carrying the A1 road blocks the line of the canal, and the terminal basin has been filled in. There are plans for a tunnel under the A1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to Grantham, and the basin could be redeveloped in due course.
There is also a dry section between Cotgrave and Kinoulton, which has presented problems since construction in the 18th century: gypsum in the soil reacted with the waterproof clay leading to leaking.

In early 2005, the Grantham Canal Partnership appointed a full-time Grantham Canal restoration manager, Kevin Mann, for an initial 18-month trial period. He would be responsible for planning and managing funding schemes for the restoration, identifying development opportunities and the promotion and interpretation of the canal. The trial proved to be successful, as he was still doing the job in 2009.

The canal and its banks between Redmile and Harby is designated a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest as Grantham Canal SSSI.

==Belvoir tramway==
The Duke of Rutland also constructed a private wagonway or tramway between the wharf at Muston Gorse and Belvoir Castle. It was constructed in 1814–15, and remained operational for 100 years. It was constructed with fish-belly rail set into stone chairs, some of which, and some wagons, still exist in the castle cellars. The gauge was , and the rails were supplied by The Butterley Company. Some are in the collection of the science museum, and the National Railway Museum where there is the chassis of one of the wagons.

<text>Louis Hubert Gonzalve Lyautey (17 November 1854 – 27 July 1934) was a French Army general and colonial administrator.

After serving in Indochina and Madagascar, he became the first French Resident-General in Morocco from 1912 to 1925. In early 1917, he served briefly as Minister of War. From 1921, he was a Marshal of France. He was dubbed the &quot;French empire builder&quot; and in 1931 made the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. Lyautey was also the first one to use the term &quot;hearts and minds&quot; as part of his strategy to counter the Black Flags rebellion during the Tonkin campaign in 1885.

== Early life ==
Lyautey was born in Nancy, the capital of Lorraine. His father was a prosperous engineer and his grandfather a highly-decorated Napoleonic general. His mother was a Norman aristocrat, and Lyautey inherited many of her assumptions: monarchism, patriotism, Catholicism and the belief in the moral and political importance of the elite. He attended &quot;lycée&quot; in Dijon, where he recalled he was fascinated with René Descartes&#x27; &quot;Discours de la Methode&quot;.

In 1873, he entered the French military academy of Saint-Cyr. He attended the army training school in early 1876 and in December 1877 was made a lieutenant. After graduating from Saint-Cyr, two months of holiday in Algeria in 1878 left him impressed by the Maghreb and by Islam. He served in the cavalry and was to make his career serving in the colonies, not in a more prestigious assignment in metropolitan France. In 1880, he was posted to Algiers and then campaigned in southern Algeria. In 1884, to his disappointment, he was recalled to France.

== Military career ==
=== Indochina ===
In 1894, he was posted to Indochina, serving under Joseph Gallieni. He helped crush the so-called piracy of the Black Flags rebellion along the Chinese border. He then set up the colonial administration in Tonkin and then became head of the military office of the Government-General in Indochina. When he left Indochina in 1897, he was a lieutenant colonel and had received the Legion of Honour.

In Indochina, he wrote: 

=== Madagascar ===
From 1897 to 1902, Lyautey served in Madagascar, again under Gallieni. He pacified northern and western Madagascar; administered a region of 200,000 inhabitants; began the construction of a new provincial capital at Ankazobe and a new roadway across the island; He encouraged the cultivation of rice, coffee, tobacco, grain, and cotton; and opened schools. In 1900 he became Governor of Southern Madagascar, an area a third the size of France with a million inhabitants; 80 officers and 4,000 soldiers served under him. He was also promoted to colonel in 1900. In Madagascar. he wrote to his father: He believed that he did not crave power for its own sake. He returned to France to command a cavalry regiment in 1902 before he was promoted to brigade general a year later, largely a result of the military skill and success which he had shown in Madagascar.

=== Morocco ===
In 1903, he was posted to command first a subdivision south of Oran and then the whole Oran district, his official task being to protect a new railway line against attacks from Morocco. French commanders in Algeria moved into Morocco largely on their own initiative in early 1903. Later that year, Lyautey marched west and occupied Béchar, a clear breach of the 1840s treaties. The following year, he advanced further into Morocco in clear disobedience of the Minister of War and threatened to resign if he were not supported by Paris. The French Foreign Minister issued a vague disavowal of Lyautey because he was concerned at clashing with British influence in Morocco. In the event, Britain, Spain and Italy were placated by France agreeing to allow them a free hand in Egypt, northern Morocco, and Libya respectively, and the only objections to French expansion in the region came from Germany (see First Moroccan Crisis).

Lyautey met Isabelle Eberhardt in 1903 and employed her for intelligence missions. After her death in 1904, he chose her tombstone.

In early 1907 Émile Mauchamp, a French doctor, was killed in Marrakesh, possibly as he was attempting to lay the groundwork for French expansion. Lyautey then occupied Oujda in eastern Morocco near the Algerian border. Having been promoted to division general, Lyautey was the military governor of French Morocco from 4 August 1907. After taking Oudja, he went to Rabat to put pressure on the Sultan and got embroiled in a power struggle between the Sultan and his brother, with Germany and France taking sides in the dispute.

On 14 October 1909 in Paris, Lyautey married Inès Fortoul, née de Bourgoing, god daughter of former Empress Eugénie and president of the French Red Cross, who had just organized the Red Cross in Morocco. The marriage was childless. He returned to France in 1910, and in January 1911, he took up command of a corps at Rennes.

In 1912 Lyautey was posted back to Morocco and relieved Fez, which was being besieged by 20,000 Moroccans. After the Convention of Fez established a protectorate over Morocco, Lyautey served as Resident-General of French Morocco from 28 April 1912 to 25 August 1925. Sultan Moulay Hafid abdicated at the end of 1912, replaced by his more pliable brother, although the country was not fully pacified until 1934.

On 31 October 1912, he was elected at the seat 14 of the Académie française.

=== First World War ===
On 27 July 1914, Resident-General Lyautey received a cable from Paris from the undersecretary of foreign affairs Abel Ferry. He was quoted as telling his officers: However, like many professional soldiers, he disliked the Third Republic and in some ways welcomed the outbreak of war &quot;because the politicians have shut up&quot;. The same day, War Minister Messimy told Lyautey to prepare to abandon Morocco except for the major cities and ports and to send all seasoned troops to France. Messimy later said that had been a &quot;formal&quot; order.

At the outbreak of the war, Lyautey commandied 70,000 troops, all members of the Armée d&#x27;Afrique or part of La Coloniale. Under French law, metropolitan conscripts could not serve except under very exceptional circumstances abroad. Initially, he sent two Algerian-Tunisian divisions to the western front, then another two, plus two brigades of Algerians serving in Morocco, and a brigade of 5,000 Moroccans. Over 70 battalions of Algerians and Tunisians served on the Western Front, and one Moroccan and seven Algerian regiments of Spahis (cavalry) served dismounted on the Western Front. Others fought in Macedonia or mounted in the Levant.

In 1914, 33 officers, 580 soldiers and the weapons of two battalions were lost in an expedition near Khenifra. Although that was to prove the only incident in Morocco during the war, Lyautey was worried about the threat of jihad as a result of German propaganda in Morocco, and many of the remaining legionnaires were German. Four territorial regiments were sent from southern France and served alongside the mobilised European colonists. By mid-1915 Lyautey had sent 42 battalions to the Western Front, receiving in return middle-aged reservists (who to his delight were regarded as seasoned warriors by the Moroccans), battalions of Tirailleurs sénégalais and Tirailleurs marocains, as well as irregular Moroccan goumiers. With 200,000 men, Lyautey had to hold down the Middle Atlas and the Rif and to suppress rebellions by Zaians at Khenifra, Abd al Malik at the Taza, and al Hiba in the south, the latter aided by German U-boats. Lyautey argued that Verdun and Morocco were part of the same war.

Lyautey disregarded advice to concentrate major forces in a few cities and took a personal risk by spreading them all over the country. In the end, his gamble turned right as he got a psychological edge over potentially mutinous tribal chiefs. Lyautey had 71,000 men by July 1915. He insisted France would win the war and continued with the usual trade fairs and road and rail construction.

== Political career ==
=== Colonial policies ===
His personal beliefs evolved from monarchism and conservatism to a belief in social duty. He wrote a journal article &quot;On the Social Function of the Officer under Universal Military Service&quot;. However, his colonial policies were similar in practice to those of Gallieni, a secular republican. He was suspicious of republicanism and socialism, and believed in the social role of the Army in regenerating France.

Lyautey adopted and emulated Gallieni&#x27;s policy of methodical expansion of pacified areas followed by social and economical development (markets, schools and medical centres) to bring about the end of resistance and the cooperation of former insurgents. This method became known as &quot;tache d&#x27;huile&quot; (literally &quot;oil stain&quot;), as it resembles oil spots spreading to cover the whole surface. Lyautey&#x27;s writings have had a significant influence on contemporary counterinsurgency theory through its adoption by David Galula. He also practiced a policy known as &quot;politique des races&quot; of dealing separately with each tribe to avoid any tribe from gaining too much influence within the colonial system.

Lyautey is considered to have been an apt colonial administrator. His governing style evolved into the Lyautey system of colonial rule. The Lyautey system invested in pre-established local governing bodies and advocated for local control. He advocated for finding a sub-group that had nationalistic tendencies but had a strong desire for local autonomy and then investing in the sub-group as political leaders. He tried to balance blunt military force with other means of power and promoted a vision of a better future for the Moroccans under the French colonial administration. For example, he invited a talented young French urban planner, Henri Prost, to design comprehensive plans for redevelopment of the major Moroccan cities.

In Morocco from 1912, he was publicly deferential to the sultan and told his men not to treat the Moroccans as a conquered people. He opposed proselytising of Christianity and the settlement of French migrants in Morocco, and quoted with approval Governor Lanessan of Indo-China &quot;we must govern with the mandarin and not against the mandarin&quot;.

=== Minister of War ===
Lyautey briefly served as France&#x27;s Minister of War for three months in 1917, which were clouded by the unsuccessful Nivelle Offensive and the French Army Mutinies. Lyautey was apparently surprised to receive a telegram offering him the job (10 December 1916) and demanded and was given authority to issue orders to Nivelle (the new Commander-in-Chief of French forces on the Western Front) and Sarrail (Commander-in-Chief at Salonika); Nivelle&#x27;s predecessor Joffre had enjoyed much greater freedom from the War Minister and had also had command over Salonika. Prime Minister Aristide Briand, not going into detail about Joffre&#x27;s removal, replied that Lyautey would be one of a War Committee of five members, controlling manufacturing, transport and supply, and thus giving him greater powers than his predecessors. Lyautey replied &quot;I shall answer your call&quot;. Lyautey had to spend a good deal of time touring units and learning about the Western front.

Lyautey was strongly disliked by the political left, and when Briand reconstructed his government in December 1916, Painlevé declined to stay part (he had been Minister of Public Instruction and Fine Arts) as he was reluctant to be associated with him, although doubts about the replacement of Joffre by Nivelle rather than Philippe Petain also played a role (Painlevé was later himself Minister of War for much of 1917, then briefly Prime Minister late in the year).

Lyautey was met with a &quot;fait accompli&quot; as Nivelle, whom he would not have chosen, had been appointed Commander-in-Chief by the acting War Minister Admiral Lacaze, whilst munitions under Albert Thomas (formerly Under-Secretary for War) were hived off into a separate ministry assisted by the industrialist Louis Loucheur as Under-Secretary of State. Lyautey had hoped to rely on Joffre, Ferdinand Foch and de Castelnau, but the first soon resigned from his job as advisor, Foch had already been sacked as commander of Army Group North, de Castelnau was sent on a mission to Russia, and Lyautey was not permitted to revive the post of Chief of the Army General Staff.

Lyautey was hard of hearing and inclined to dominate conversation. As minister and cabinet member, he preferred to deal directly with the British government via the British Embassy, to the annoyance of the British CIGS Robertson (at a time when generals of both countries tried to prevent politicians from &quot;interfering&quot; in the details of strategy), who disliked Lyautey. On the train to the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lyautey stood before a map lecturing the British delegation on their Palestine campaign. Robertson, a man of notorious bluntness, listened to the lecture then asked Lloyd George &quot;has he finished?&quot; before retiring to bed. Robertson told Lloyd George &quot;that fellow won’t last long&quot;. He wrote to the King’s adviser Clive Wigram (12 January): 

Lyautey attended the infamous Calais Conference on 27 February 1917, at which Lloyd George attempted to subordinate British forces in France to Nivelle. After a serious argument had broken out between Lloyd George and the British generals, Lyautey claimed that he had not seen the proposals until he boarded the train for Calais. On being shown Nivelle&#x27;s plan, Lyautey declared that it was &quot;a plan for &quot;the Duchess of Gerolstein&quot; &quot; (a light opera satirising the army). He contemplated trying to have Nivelle dismissed but backed down in the face of traditional republican hostility to military men with political aspirations. Lyautey shared his concerns about Nivelle with Petain, commander of Army Group Centre, who would eventually replace him.

Lyautey refused to discuss military aviation even at a closed session of the French Chamber and at the subsequent open session declared that to discuss such matters even in closed session would be a security risk. He resigned as Minister of War after being shouted down in the Chamber on 15 March 1917, and after several leading politicians declined the post of Minister of War, Aristide Briand&#x27;s sixth cabinet (12 December 1916 – 20 March 1917) fell four days later.

== Postwar ==

Lyautey caused the Institute for Advanced Moroccan Studies and the Sherifian Scientific Institute to be set up in the early 1920s.

During the First World War, he had insisted on the continuation of the occupation of the whole country regardless of the fact that France needed most of her resources in the struggle against the Central Powers. He was in overall command of French forces during the time of the Zaian War of 1914–21. He resigned in 1925, feeling slighted that Paris had appointed Philippe Pétain to command 100,000 men to put down Abd-el-Krim’s rebellion in the Rif Mountains.

Political opposition in Paris ensured that he received no official recognition when he resigned; his only escort home was two destroyers of the Royal Navy.

Marshal Lyautey served as honorary president of the three French Scouting associations.

=== Paris Exposition ===
Lyautey was commissioner of the Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931, designed to encourage support for the empire in Metropolitan France. The introduction to the visitors guide contained Lyautey’s instruction: &quot;you must find in this exhibition, along with the lessons of the past, the lessons of the present and above all lessons for the future. You must leave the exhibition resolved always to do better, grander, broader and more versatile feats for Greater France.&quot; A special extension line of the Paris Metro was built to Bois de Vincennes. Despite costing the French government and City of Paris 318m francs, the exhibition made a profit of 33m francs. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal and the USA also contributed exhibitions on their overseas possessions, but not Britain, which despite repeated pleas by Lyautey cited the cost of its own exhibition of 1924.

The Palais de la Porte Dorée in Bois de Vincennes housed part of the Colonial Exhibition of 1931; Lyautey&#x27;s study is preserved as part of the foyer.

=== Final years ===
In his final years, Lyautey became associated with France&#x27;s growing fascist movement. He admired Italian leader Benito Mussolini, and was associated with the far right Croix de Feu. In 1934, he threatened to lead the Jeunesses Patriotes to overthrow the government. The same year he contributed to the effort to warn French people against Hitler through a critical introduction of an unauthorised edition of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

Lyautey would have liked to have been a national saviour; he was disappointed to have played only a minor role in France&#x27;s political life and in the First World War.

Lyautey died in Thorey-Lyautey in 1934. His ashes were brought back to Morocco, where they lay in state in a mausoleum in the Chellah, at Rabat. After Morocco became independent in 1956, his remains were returned to France and interred in Les Invalides in 1961.

== Homosexuality ==
Lyautey has been called &quot;perhaps France&#x27;s most distinguished – or infamous – homosexual.&quot; Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau – whom Lyautey despised, as he did most politicians – is quoted as having said: It has been speculated that Lyautey might have provided Marcel Proust with the model for the character of the homosexual Baron de Charlus in his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;.

The actual evidence for Lyautey being a homosexual is primarily circumstantial, but it was widely regarded as an open secret at the time, one which some historians claim Lyautey did not take any effort to hide. Robert Aldrich writes that he liked hot climates and &quot;the masculine company of young officers&quot;. Lyautey&#x27;s wife is said to have told a group of her husband&#x27;s young officers that &quot;I have the pleasure of informing you that last night I made you all cuckolds,&quot; implying that the officers were all &quot;paramours&quot; of her husband, and that she had had sex with Lyautey the night before.

Lyautey&#x27;s homosexuality, or at the very least his &quot;homophile sensuality&quot; or &quot;Greek virtues&quot;, was in some ways connected with his time in Morocco. Lyautey&#x27;s sexual preference for men was not caused by his sojourn in Morocco, as there were those who objected to his appointment as commander there because he was a homosexual.

== In popular culture ==
Lyautey plays a major role in &quot;Garment of Shadows&quot; (2013), a Sherlock Holmes/Mary Russell novel by Laurie R. King, set in Morocco in 1925. He is said to be a distant cousin of Holmes.

== Burial and legacy ==

Following his resignation from the position of Resident-general in 1925, Lyautey planned for his own burial in Rabat and in 1933 requested painter Joseph de La Nézière to produce a sketch for his mausoleum as a traditional Muslim Qubba. Following Lyautey&#x27;s death in France on 1934-07-27 and his state funeral in Nancy on 1934-08-03, the French authorities decided to locate his resting place on the Protectorate Residence&#x27;s grounds rather than in more iconic locations such as Chellah or near the Hassan Tower, which could have offended some Muslim Moroccan sensitivities. Even so, the erection of a monument to Morocco&#x27;s Christian colonizer was controversial and criticized by Mohamed Belhassan Wazzani and other nationalist and Muslim leaders. Reflecting those misgivings, Sultan Mohammed V of Morocco declined to attend the funeral on the Residence grounds on 1935-10-31, when Lyautey&#x27;s remains were eventually placed in the completed mausoleum, even though he participated in a ceremony earlier the same day at Bab er-Rouah in downtown Rabat. The mausoleum building was designed by architect René Canu based on La Nézière&#x27;s sketch.

Following Moroccan independence, French President Charles de Gaulle and Mohammed V, by then the King of Morocco, agreed to preempt the risk of incidents around the still controversial mausoleum and to repatriate Lyautey&#x27;s remains, which were ceremoniously removed on 1961-04-22 and shipped to France via Casablanca. The mausoleum remained empty thereafter. Lyautey was reburied in Les Invalides in Paris, first in the of the church of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides on 1961-05-10, and then in 1963 in the complex&#x27;s Dome Church. There, his remains lie in an ornamented casket designed by Albert Laprade, the Residence&#x27;s original architect almost a half-century earlier, and made by celebrated art deco metalworker .

*The town of Kenitra, Morocco was named &quot;Port Lyautey&quot; by the French in 1933, but renamed after independence in 1956.
*The Garrison of the 13th Parachute Dragoon Regiment is named after him.
*Lycée Lyautey in Casablanca, Morocco is named after him. An equestrian statue of Lyautey is located at the French consulate in Casablanca.
*Lyautey is remembered for his words in a critical moment, &quot;Whoever does not impose his will submits to that of the enemy.&quot;
*Lyautey has been suggested as the author of the aphorism that &quot;a language is a dialect which owns an army and a navy&quot; (&quot;Une langue, c&#x27;est un dialecte qui possède une armée et une marine&quot;).
*Mount Lyautey in the Canadian Rockies was named for him in 1918.

<doc id="623831" wikidata="Q940058" url="?curid=623831" title="Eval">
<text>In some programming languages, codice_1 , short for , is a function which evaluates a string as though it were an expression in the language, and returns a result; in others, it executes multiple lines of code as though they had been included instead of the line including the codice_1. The input to codice_1 is not necessarily a string; it may be structured representation of code, such as an abstract syntax tree (like Lisp forms), or of special type such as codice_4 (as in Python). The analog for a statement is exec, which executes a string (or code in other format) as if it were a statement; in some languages, such as Python, both are present, while in other languages only one of either codice_1 or codice_6 is.

== Security risks ==
Using codice_1 with data from an untrusted source may introduce security vulnerabilities. For instance, assuming that the codice_8 function gets data from the Internet, this Python code is insecure:

session[&#x27;authenticated&#x27;] = False
data = get_data()
foo = eval(data)
An attacker could supply the program with the string codice_9 as data, which would update the codice_10 dictionary to set an authenticated key to be True. To remedy this, all data which will be used with codice_1 must be escaped, or it must be run without access to potentially harmful functions.

== Implementation ==
In interpreted languages, codice_1 is almost always implemented with the same interpreter as normal code. In compiled languages, the same compiler used to compile programs may be embedded in programs using the codice_1 function; separate interpreters are sometimes used, though this results in code duplication.

== Programming languages ==
=== ECMAScript ===
==== JavaScript ====
In JavaScript, codice_1 is something of a hybrid between an expression evaluator and a statement executor. It returns the result of the last expression evaluated.

Example as an expression evaluator:

foo = 2;
alert(eval(&#x27;foo + 2&#x27;));
Example as a statement executor:

foo = 2;
eval(&#x27;foo = foo + 2;alert(foo);&#x27;);
One use of JavaScript&#x27;s codice_1 is to parse JSON text, perhaps as part of an Ajax framework. However, modern browsers provide codice_16 as a more secure alternative for this task.

==== ActionScript ====

In ActionScript (Flash&#x27;s programming language), codice_1 cannot be used to evaluate arbitrary expressions. According to the Flash 8 documentation, its usage is limited to expressions which represent &quot;the name of a variable, property, object, or movie clip to retrieve. This parameter can be either a String or a direct reference to the object instance.&quot;

ActionScript 3 does not support eval.

The ActionScript 3 Eval Library and the D.eval API were development projects to create equivalents to codice_1 in ActionScript 3. Both have ended, as Adobe Flash Player has reached its end-of-life.

=== Lisp ===
Lisp was the original language to make use of an codice_1 function in 1958. In fact, definition of the codice_1 function led to the first implementation of the language interpreter.
Before the codice_1 function was defined, Lisp functions were manually compiled to assembly language statements. However, once the codice_1 function had been manually compiled it was then used as part of a simple read-eval-print loop which formed the basis of the first Lisp interpreter.

Later versions of the Lisp codice_1 function have also been implemented as compilers.

The codice_1 function in Lisp expects a form to be evaluated as its argument. The resulting value of the given form will be the returned value of the call to codice_1.

This is an example Lisp code:
; A form which calls the + function with 1,2 and 3 as arguments.
; It returns 6.
(+ 1 2 3)
; In Lisp any form is meant to be evaluated, therefore
; the call to + was performed.
; We can prevent Lisp from performing evaluation
; of a form by prefixing it with &quot;&#x27;&quot;, for example:
(setq form1 &#x27;(+ 1 2 3))
; Now form1 contains a form that can be used by eval, for
; example:
(eval form1)
; eval evaluated (+ 1 2 3) and returned 6.
Lisp is well known to be very flexible and so is the codice_1 function. For example, to evaluate the content of a string, the string would first have to be converted into a Lisp form using the codice_27 function and then the resulting form would have to be passed to codice_1:

(eval (read-from-string &quot;(format t \&quot;Hello World!!!~%\&quot;)&quot;))

One major point of confusion is the question, in which context the symbols in the form will be evaluated. In the above example, codice_29 contains the symbol codice_30. Evaluation of this symbol must yield the function for addition to make the example work as intended. Thus some dialects of Lisp allow an additional parameter for codice_1 to specify the context of evaluation (similar to the optional arguments to Python&#x27;s codice_1 function - see below). An example in the Scheme dialect of Lisp (R5RS and later):
;; Define some simple form as in the above example.
(define form2 &#x27;(+ 5 2))
;Value: form2

;; Evaluate the form within the initial context.
;; A context for evaluation is called an &quot;environment&quot; in Scheme slang.
(eval form2 user-initial-environment)
;Value: 7

;; Confuse the initial environment, so that + will be
;; a name for the subtraction function.
(environment-define user-initial-environment &#x27;+ -)
;Value: +

;; Evaluate the form again.
;; Notice that the returned value has changed.
(eval form2 user-initial-environment)
;Value: 3
=== Perl ===
In Perl, the codice_1 function is something of a hybrid between an expression evaluator and a statement executor. It returns the result of the last expression evaluated (all statements are expressions in Perl programming), and allows the final semicolon to be left off.

Example as an expression evaluator:

$foo = 2;
print eval(&#x27;$foo + 2&#x27;), &quot;\n&quot;;
Example as a statement executor:

$foo = 2;
eval(&#x27;$foo += 2; print &quot;$foo\n&quot;;&#x27;);
Perl also has codice_1 &quot;blocks&quot;, which serves as its exception handling mechanism (see Exception handling syntax#Perl). This differs from the above use of codice_1 with strings in that code inside codice_1 blocks is interpreted at compile-time instead of run-time, so it is not the meaning of codice_1 used in this article.

=== PHP ===
In PHP, codice_1 executes code in a string almost exactly as if it had been put in the file instead of the call to codice_39. The only exception is that errors are reported as coming from a call to codice_39, and return statements become the result of the function.

Unlike some languages, the argument to codice_1 must be a string of one or more complete statements, not just expressions; however, one can get the &quot;expression&quot; form of codice_1 by putting the expression in a return statement, which causes codice_1 to return the result of that expression.

Unlike some languages, PHP&#x27;s codice_1 is a &quot;language construct&quot; rather than a function, and so cannot be used in some contexts where functions can be, like higher-order functions.

Example using echo:

&lt;?php
$foo = &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
eval(&#x27;echo &quot;$foo&quot;;&#x27;);


Example returning a value:

&lt;?php
$foo = &quot;Goodbye, world!\n&quot;; //does not work in PHP5
echo eval(&#x27;return $foo;&#x27;);


===Lua===
In Lua 5.1, codice_45 compiles Lua code into an anonymous function.

Example as an expression evaluator:

loadstring(&quot;print(&#x27;Hello World!&#x27;)&quot;)()
Example to do the evaluation in two steps:

a = 1
f = loadstring(&quot;return a + 1&quot;) -- compile the expression to an anonymous function
print(f()) -- execute (and print the result &#x27;2&#x27;)
Lua 5.2 deprecates codice_45 in favor of the existing codice_47 function, which has been augmented to accept strings. In addition, it allows providing the function&#x27;s environment directly, as environments are now upvalues.

load(&quot;print(&#x27;Hello &#x27; .. a)&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, { a = &quot;World!&quot;, print = print })()
=== PostScript ===
PostScript&#x27;s codice_6 operator takes an operand — if it is a simple literal it pushes it back on the stack. If one takes a string containing a PostScript expression however, one can convert the string to an executable which then can be executed by the interpreter, for example:
((Hello World) =) cvx exec

converts the PostScript expression
(Hello World) =

which pops the string &quot;Hello World&quot; off the stack and displays it on the screen, to have an executable type, then is executed.

PostScript&#x27;s codice_49 operator is similar in functionality but instead the interpreter interprets PostScript expressions in a file, itself.
(file.ps) run
=== Python ===
In Python, the codice_1 function in its simplest form evaluates a single expression.

codice_1 example (interactive shell):

»&gt; x = 1
»&gt; eval(&#x27;x + 1&#x27;)
2
»&gt; eval(&#x27;x&#x27;)
1
The codice_1 function takes two optional arguments, codice_53 and codice_54, which allow the programmer to set up a restricted environment for the evaluation of the expression.

The codice_6 statement (or the codice_6 function in Python 3.x) executes statements:

codice_6 example (interactive shell):

»&gt; x = 1
»&gt; y = 1
»&gt; exec &quot;x += 1; y -= 1&quot;
»&gt; x
2
»&gt; y
0
The most general form for evaluating statements/expressions is using code objects. Those can be created by invoking the codice_58 function and by telling it what kind of input it has to compile: an &quot;codice_6&quot; statement, an &quot;codice_1&quot; statement or a &quot;codice_61&quot; statement:

codice_62 example (interactive shell):

»&gt; x = 1
»&gt; y = 2
»&gt; eval (compile (&quot;print &#x27;x + y = &#x27;, x + y&quot;, &quot;compile-sample.py&quot;, &quot;single&quot;))
x + y = 3
=== D ===
D is a statically compiled language and therefore does not include an &quot;codice_1&quot; statement in the traditional sense, but does include the related &quot;codice_64&quot; statement. The difference is that, where &quot;codice_1&quot; interprets a string as code at runtime, with a &quot;codice_64&quot; the string is statically compiled like ordinary code and must be known at compile time. For example:
import std.stdio;

void main() {
 int num = 0;
 mixin(&quot;num++;&quot;);
 writeln(num); // Prints 1.


The above example will compile to exactly the same assembly language instructions as if &quot;codice_67&quot; had been written directly instead of mixed in. The argument to mixin doesn&#x27;t need to be a string literal, but arbitrary expressions resulting in a string value, including function calls, that can be evaluated at compile time.

=== ColdFusion ===
ColdFusion&#x27;s codice_68 function lets you evaluate a string expression at runtime.

&lt;cfset x = &quot;int(1+1)&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfset y = Evaluate(x)&gt;
It is particularly useful when you need to programmatically choose the variable you want to read from.
&lt;cfset x = Evaluate(&quot;queryname.#columnname#[rownumber]&quot;)&gt;

=== Ruby ===
The Ruby programming language interpreter offers an codice_1 function similar to Python or Perl, and also allows a scope, or binding, to be specified.

Aside from specifying a function&#x27;s binding, codice_1 may also be used to evaluate an expression within a specific class definition binding or object instance binding, allowing classes to be extended with new methods specified in strings.
a = 1
eval(&#x27;a + 1&#x27;) # (evaluates to 2)

# evaluating within a context
def get_binding(a)
 binding
end
eval(&#x27;a+1&#x27;,get_binding(3)) # (evaluates to 4, because &#x27;a&#x27; in the context of get_binding is 3)

class Test; end
Test.class_eval(&quot;def hello; return &#x27;hello&#x27;;end&quot;) # add a method &#x27;hello&#x27; to this class
Test.new.hello # evaluates to &quot;hello&quot;
=== Forth ===
Most standard implementations of Forth have two variants of codice_1: codice_72 and codice_73.

Win32FORTH code example:

S&quot; 2 2 + .&quot; EVALUATE \ Outputs &quot;4&quot;
=== BASIC ===
==== REALbasic ====
In REALbasic, there is a class called RBScript which can execute REALbasic code at runtime. RBScript is very sandboxed—only the most core language features are there, and you have to allow it access to things you want it to have. You can optionally assign an object to the context property. This allows for the code in RBScript to call functions and use properties of the context object. However, it is still limited to only understanding the most basic types, so if you have a function that returns a Dictionary or MySpiffyObject, RBScript will be unable to use it. You can also communicate with your RBScript through the Print and Input events.

==== VBScript ====
Microsoft&#x27;s VBScript, which is an interpreted language, has two constructs. codice_74 is a function evaluator that can include calls to user-defined functions. (These functions may have side-effects such as changing the values of global variables.) codice_75 executes one or more colon-separated statements, which can change global state.

Both VBScript and JScript codice_1 are available to developers of compiled Windows applications (written in languages which do not support Eval) through an ActiveX control called the Microsoft Script Control, whose Eval method can be called by application code. To support calling of user-defined functions, one must first initialize the control with the AddCode method, which loads a string (or a string resource) containing a library of user-defined functions defined in the language of one&#x27;s choice, prior to calling Eval.

====Visual Basic for Applications====
Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), the programming language of Microsoft Office, is a virtual machine language where the runtime environment compiles and runs p-code. Its flavor of Eval supports only expression evaluation, where the expression may include user-defined functions and objects (but not user-defined variable names). Of note, the evaluator is different from VBS, and invocation of certain user-defined functions may work differently in VBA than the identical code in VBScript.

=== Smalltalk ===
As Smalltalk&#x27;s compiler classes are part of the standard class library and usually present at run time, these can be used to evaluate a code string.

Compiler evaluate:&#x27;1 + 2&#x27;

Because class and method definitions are also implemented by message-sends (to class objects), even code changes are possible:

Compiler evaluate:&#x27;Object subclass:#Foo&#x27;
=== Tcl ===
The Tcl programming language has a command called codice_1, which executes the source code provided as an argument. Tcl represents all source code as strings, with curly braces acting as quotation marks, so that the argument to codice_1 can have the same formatting as any other source code.
set foo {
 while {[incr i]&lt;10} {
 puts &quot;$i squared is [expr $i*$i]&quot;
}
eval $foo 
=== bs ===
bs has an codice_1 function that takes one string argument. The function is both an expression evaluator and a statement executor. In the latter role, it can also be used for error handling. The following examples and text are from the codice_80 man page as appears in the UNIX System V Release 3.2 Programmer&#x27;s Manual.

== Command-line interpreters ==

=== Unix shells ===
The &quot;eval&quot; command is present in all Unix shells, including the original &quot;sh&quot; (Bourne shell). It concatenates all the arguments with spaces, then re-parses and executes the result as a command. 

=== PowerShell ===
In PowerShell, the codice_81 Cmdlet serves the same purpose as the eval function in programming languages like JavaScript, PHP and Python.
The Cmdlet runs any PowerShell expression that is provided as a command parameter in the form of a string and outputs the result of the specified expression.
Usually, the output of the Cmdlet is of the same type as the result of executing the expression. However, if the result is an empty array, it outputs codice_82. In case the result is a single-element array, it outputs that single element. Similar to JavaScript, PowerShell allows the final semicolon to be left off.

Example as an expression evaluator:

PS &gt; $foo = 2
PS &gt; Invoke-Expression &#x27;$foo + 2&#x27;

Example as a statement executor:

PS &gt; $foo = 2
PS &gt; Invoke-Expression &#x27;$foo += 2; $foo&#x27;
==Microcode==
In 1966 IBM Conversational Programming System (CPS) introduced a microprogrammed function codice_83 to perform &quot;interpretive evaluation of expressions which are written in a modified Polish-string notation&quot; on an IBM System/360 Model 50. Microcoding this function was &quot;substantially more&quot; than five times faster compared to a program that interpreted an assignment statement.

==Theory==
In theoretical computer science, a careful distinction is commonly made between eval and apply. &quot;Eval&quot; is understood to be the step of converting a quoted string into a callable function and its arguments, whereas &quot;apply&quot; is the actual call of the function with a given set of arguments. The distinction is particularly noticeable in functional languages, and languages based on lambda calculus, such as LISP and Scheme. Thus, for example, in Scheme, the distinction is between

 (eval &#x27;(f x) )

where the form (f x) is to be evaluated, and

 (apply f (list x))

where the function &quot;f&quot; is to be called with argument &quot;x&quot;.

&quot;Eval&quot; and &quot;apply&quot; are the two interdependent components of the &quot;eval-apply cycle&quot;, which is the essence of evaluating Lisp, described in SICP.

In category theory, the &quot;eval&quot; morphism is used to define the closed monoidal category. Thus, for example, the category of sets, with functions taken as morphisms, and the cartesian product taken as the product, forms a Cartesian closed category. Here, &quot;eval&quot; (or, properly speaking, &quot;apply&quot;) together with its right adjoint, currying, form the simply typed lambda calculus, which can be interpreted to be the morphisms of Cartesian closed categories.

<doc id="623832" wikidata="Q2632587" url="?curid=623832" title="Henry Warner Slocum">
<text>Henry Warner Slocum Sr. (September 24, 1827 – April 14, 1894), was a Union general during the American Civil War and later served in the United States House of Representatives from New York. During the war, he was one of the youngest major generals in the Army and fought numerous major battles in the Eastern Theater and in Georgia and the Carolinas. While commanding a regiment, a brigade, a division, and a corps in the Army of the Potomac, he saw action at First Bull Run, the Peninsula Campaign, Harpers Ferry, South Mountain, Antietam, and Chancellorsville.

At Gettysburg, he was the senior Union General in the Field, under Gen. George G. Meade. During the battle, he held the Union right from Culp&#x27;s Hill to across the Baltimore Pike. His successful defense of Culp&#x27;s Hill was crucial to the Union victory at Gettysburg. After the fall of Vicksburg on the Mississippi River, splitting the southern Confederacy, Slocum was appointed military commander of the district. Slocum participated in the Atlanta Campaign and was the first commander to enter the city on September 2, 1864. He then served as occupation commander of Atlanta.

Slocum was appointed the commander of the left wing of Gen. William T. Sherman&#x27;s famous &quot;March to the Sea&quot; to Savannah on the Atlantic coast through Georgia and afterwards turning north through the Carolinas, commanding the XIV and XX Corps, comprising the Army of Georgia. During this campaign, he captured the then state capital of Georgia, Milledgeville, and the Atlantic coast seaport of Savannah.

In the Carolinas campaign, Slocum&#x27;s army saw victories in the battles of Averasborough and Bentonville, North Carolina. The &quot;March to the Sea&quot; and the Carolinas campaign were crucial to the overall Union victory in the Civil War. After the surrender of Confederate forces, Slocum was given command of the Department of Mississippi. Slocum declined an officer&#x27;s appointment in the postwar Regular Army. He was a successful political leader in the North, a businessman and railroad developer.

==Early life and career==
Slocum was born in Delphi Falls, a hamlet in Onondaga County, New York. His father was Matthew B. Slocum, and his mother was Mary Ostrander. He was the sixth of eleven children. He attended the State Normal School in Albany and the Cazenovia Seminary in Madison County. At the age of 16, he received a Public School Teacher&#x27;s Certificate from the County Superintendent of Schools, and worked occasionally as a teacher for the next five years.

Congressman Daniel Gott appointed Slocum to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1848, where he did well academically, graduating seventh of 43 in the class of 1852. He tutored his roommate, cadet Philip Sheridan, in mathematics. In his memoirs, Sheridan credited Slocum with helping him pass his examination and graduate from the academy. While at West Point, Slocum expressed opposition to slavery, which was an unpopular position since many of the cadets were from the South.

Slocum was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 1st U.S. Artillery on July 1, 1852. He served in the Seminole War in Florida and at Fort Moultrie in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. While stationed there, he went on leave to marry Clara Rice in 1854. They had four children including Henry Slocum, Junior. Slocum was promoted to first lieutenant on March 3, 1855. He resigned his commission October 31, 1856, and settled in Syracuse, New York.

While serving in the army, Slocum studied law under B. C. Presley, who was later elected Supreme Court Justice of South Carolina. Slocum was admitted to the bar in 1858 and practiced in Syracuse. He served as the county treasurer and was a member of the New York State Assembly (Onondaga Co., 2nd D.) in 1859. During this period he also served as an artillery instructor in the New York Militia with the rank of colonel.

==Civil War==

===Early commands===
At the outbreak of the Civil War, Slocum was appointed colonel of the 27th New York Infantry, which was a two-year regiment mustered in at Elmira, New York. He led the regiment at First Bull Run, where it was in the thick of the fighting, losing 130 men. Slocum himself was badly wounded, and after recuperating, he got command of a brigade in General William B. Franklin&#x27;s division in the Army of the Potomac. When Franklin became commander of the new VI Corps in May 1862, Slocum took over command of the division, leading it with distinction during the Seven Days Battles. General Fitz-John Porter complimented Slocum&#x27;s division in the Virginia campaigns as &quot;one of the best divisions in the Army.&quot;

On July 25, 1862, Slocum was promoted to major general of volunteers to rank from July 4, the second youngest man in the Army to achieve that rank. The VI Corps stayed in Washington D.C. during the Northern Virginia Campaign, although one of Slocum&#x27;s brigades was sent down to Bull Run and attacked and routed by the Confederates on August 26. At Crampton&#x27;s Gap during the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, 1862, Slocum assaulted the enemy line behind a stone wall and routed it. Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin, corps commander, described the victory as &quot;the completest victory gained up to that time by any part of the Army of the Potomac.&quot;

At Antietam, Slocum&#x27;s division was not significantly engaged. The following month, he was named permanent commander of the XII Corps, which had lost its commander, General Joseph K. Mansfield at Antietam. During the Fredericksburg Campaign, Slocum and the XII Corps were stationed around Harper&#x27;s Ferry and had no involvement in the Battle of Fredericksburg. At the Battle of Chancellorsville on May 1–5, 1863, Slocum commanded the Union right wing, including the XII Corps and the V Corps of Maj. Gen. George G. Meade and the XI Corps of Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard, a combined force of 46,000 men. Slocum executed well and maneuvered his wing into the rear of Gen. Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army, halting the Confederate advance.

When Joe Hooker was removed from command of the army on June 28, Slocum, as the ranking corps commander, would normally be in line to succeed him, but the War Department instead appointed George Meade as army commander, apparently feeling that he was a more aggressive fighter. Slocum graciously consented to serving under Meade, his junior in rank.

===Gettysburg===
Maj. Gen. Slocum played a decisive role in the Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863. His XII Corps troops&#x27; defense of Culp&#x27;s Hill on the Union right is credited with ensuring Meade&#x27;s ultimate victory against Lee&#x27;s army.

Despite this, some modern historians of Gettysburg have questioned the actions of Slocum on the afternoon of July 1, 1863. They allege that he failed to come to the immediate aid of General Howard&#x27;s XI Corps and engage Confederate troops in a timely way at Gettysburg. Information from recently accessed records, however, including Gen. Meade&#x27;s archives, shows that Slocum, in fact, dispatched the First Division of his Corps to Gettysburg immediately upon hearing the first report of the fighting. Further, Gen. Slocum&#x27;s First Division commander, Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams, verified this as he reported in late 1865 that &quot;when reports of the battle going on in advance of Gettysburg were brought to Gen. Slocum ... orders were issued to put the corps in motion,&quot; and the &quot;corps was immediately put in rapid march toward the scene.&quot;

A report by Maj. Guindon, whom Slocum had sent on a reconnaissance mission, corroborates Williams&#x27; report; Maj. Guindon indicated that Slocum moved out troops even before he received a request for aid from Gen. Howard. Furthermore, Slocum advanced his First Division despite an order (known as the &quot;Pipe Creek Circular&quot;) issued by General Meade that morning, and received by Slocum at 1:30 pm, to &quot;halt your command where this order reaches you.&quot; Contrary to modern interpretation, Slocum&#x27;s actions in fact showed initiative.

Slocum arrived at the battlefield marching from Two Taverns on the Baltimore Pike, about 5 miles southeast of the battlefield, late in the afternoon on July 1, 1863.

As the ranking general on the field, Slocum commanded the Union army for about six hours, until Meade arrived after midnight. During this time, Slocum was responsible for the supervision of the formation of the Union defensive lines. For the duration of the battle, Slocum would command the Union line from the &quot;point of the fish hook&quot; from Culp&#x27;s Hill to the south. Slocum&#x27;s XII Corps would successfully defend Culp&#x27;s Hill for three days, denying a Confederate victory at this most crucial of battles. During the battle of Culp&#x27;s Hill, in addition to his own XII Corps, Slocum commanded elements of the I, VI and XI Corps.

On July 2 at midnight, Gen. Meade called for a council of war with his corps commanders. It was held at his field headquarters in the front room of the Leister house. He asked his commanders whether the Union Army should remain in its present position, or to retire to another position nearer its base of supplies. Further, if the Army remained in its present position, should it attack or await the attack of the enemy. It is then that Slocum gave his recommendation to &quot;Stay and fight it out.&quot;

Meade planned an attack from the Power&#x27;s Hill area into the Confederate left flank, to be led by Slocum the following day, utilizing the V Corps and the XII Corps as the army&#x27;s &quot;right wing.&quot; Slocum reported to Meade that he believed the plan was not feasible, as the terrain was too difficult for an assault. General Gouvernor K. Warren agreed with Slocum&#x27;s assessment.

When Meade ordered Slocum to send the entire XII Corps to assist the defense against Lt. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s assault on the Union left flank on July 2, Slocum wisely recommended holding one brigade back in its position on Culp&#x27;s Hill. This brigade, under Brig. Gen. George S. Greene, was able to hold out against a massive Confederate assault and saved the critical hill for the Union. This brigade was composed of five regiments of infantry, of only 1,350 soldiers. The regiments were: the 60th New York, Colonel Abel Godard; the 78th New York, Colonel Herbert von Hammerstein; the 102nd New York, Colonel Lewis R. Stegman; the 137th New York, Colonel David Ireland; and the 149th New York, Colonel Henry A. Barnum.

General Greene later wrote in an article for &quot;Century Magazine&quot;, &quot;To the discernment of General Slocum who saw the danger to which the army would exposed by the movement ordered by Meade to deplete the right wing the afternoon of July 2, and who took the responsibility of modifying the orders which he had received from Meade is due the honor of having saved the army from a great and perhaps fatal disaster.&quot;

General Oliver O. Howard later recalled of Slocum&#x27;s troops and the defense of Culp&#x27;s Hill: &quot;The fighting at Culp&#x27;s Hill was the most impressive incident of the Battle of Gettysburg ... a step all-important and essential to victory ... Slocum ... prevented Meade from losing the Battle of Gettysburg.&quot; Slocum&#x27;s XII Corps received no medals of honor for the defense of Culp&#x27;s Hill and the Union right wing.&quot;

===Western Theater===
During the autumn of 1863, Slocum was transferred with his corps to the Western Theater. When he learned that he would have to serve under Joe Hooker, Slocum, who had disliked Hooker since Chancellorsville, wrote to President Lincoln saying that he would rather resign from the Army. Lincoln assured him that he would not actually have to serve under Hooker and a compromise was reached whereby one division of the corps, under Slocum, was assigned to protect the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad while the other division served directly under Hooker.

During the summer of 1864, Slocum commanded the District of Vicksburg and the XVII Corps of the Department of the Tennessee. Slocum&#x27;s administration of the district of Vicksburg was so efficient and successful that attempts to transfer Slocum to a fighting command in Georgia were prevented by Union Army commander General Ulysses S. Grant.

When Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson was killed in action during the Atlanta Campaign, command of Army of the Tennessee opened up, and when Hooker did not get it he resigned his commission. Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman appointed Slocum to command the XX Corps, which earlier had been formed by merging the XI Corps and XII Corps into a single command. His former XII Corps soldiers cheered their previous commander&#x27;s return. When Atlanta fell to Sherman on September 2, 1864, Gen. Slocum and his corps were the first to enter the city.

Slocum was occupation commander of Atlanta for ten weeks, during which time he tried to make the occupation as tolerable for civilians as he could. Slocum wrote to his wife in a letter on November 7, 1864: &quot;I wish for humanity&#x27;s sake that this sad war could be brought to a close. While laboring to make it successful, I shall do all in my power to mitigate its horrors.&quot;

At the start of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, Sherman left Slocum in command of 12,000 troops in Atlanta as Sherman pursued Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood and his army.

=== March to the Sea: Savannah Campaign ===
One of General Slocum&#x27;s most important commands was that of the Army of Georgia, which participated in the famous March to the Sea. Slocum and his Army of Georgia participated in all engagements from the beginning of the March on November 16 until the surrender of the Confederate forces of General Joseph E. Johnston.

General William Tecumseh Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea, also called the Savannah Campaign, was among the most effective campaigns of the Civil War. The plan was conceived by Sherman himself, and approved by General Ulysses S. Grant and President Abraham Lincoln.

Sherman&#x27;s objective was to divide the Confederacy in two along a West to East path following its strategic rail lines. Sherman&#x27;s Army would exchange its inland base of Atlanta for the more secure base (Savannah) on the Atlantic coast, which was controlled by the Union Navy. Another objective was to disrupt the Southern economy by limiting access to vast food stores, manufacturing and destroying their rail and communication systems. Furthermore, it would demonstrate that the Southern Army could not defend their heartland. The campaign would prevent reinforcing of Lee&#x27;s troops defending Petersburg, Virginia, and the Confederate capital of Richmond. Sherman&#x27;s Savannah campaign was considered a major Union success. Historians have stated that this was a major contribution to the overall Union victory in the war. The March was considered revolutionary, and in some ways unique, in the annals of modern warfare.

Sherman&#x27;s Army was composed of two armies, called wings, and a cavalry division. During the March, they followed separate paths along four parallel routes, 20–60 miles apart. Columns of men could stretch up to 50 miles long. Wagon columns could stretch up to 30 miles. The right wing (southern column; Army of the Tennessee) marched along the Georgia railroad, the Macon and Western railroad. The left wing (northern column; Army of Georgia) marched following the Georgia railroad, feinting toward Augusta. Sherman&#x27;s plan was to confuse the Confederate Army as to his objectives. The city he was heading for was Milledgeville, the Georgia state capital, which was captured on November 22, 1864. The ultimate objective of the March was the port city of Savannah, which was captured and occupied on December 21, 1864.

Sherman later placed Slocum in command of the newly created Army of Georgia, composed of the XIV Corps and the XX Corps from the Army of the Cumberland, which served as the left wing in Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. The total number of officers and men in Slocum&#x27;s Army of Georgia was 26,703. The XIV Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, had 13,962 officers and men. The XX Corps, commanded by Brig. Gen. Alpheus S. Williams, had 13,714 officers and men. The other wing, consisting of the XV and XVII Corps of the Army of the Tennessee, was commanded by Gen. Oliver O. Howard.

Sherman&#x27;s Army travelled light. Individual soldiers carried only minimal amounts of supplies, ammunition, rations. The Army, cut off from its supply base, partially lived off captured supplies. Sherman brought sufficient rations for the initial campaigns. He wrote, &quot;I had wagons enough loaded with essentials, and beef cattle enough to feed on for more than a month, and had the census statistics showing the produce of every county through which I desired to pass. No military expedition was ever based on sounder or surer data.&quot;

Each brigade had 50 enlisted men and one officer foraging team for supplying food.

Approximately 3,000 infantrymen were engaged in foraging on any given day of the March. That represents 5% of all infantrymen on the March.

The Savannah campaign was launched on November 15 and concluded with the capture and occupation of Savannah on December 21, 1864 (36 days). There were 25 days of actual marching. Slocum&#x27;s army traversed approximately 300 miles (480 km). Slocum&#x27;s Army of Georgia moved, on average, 12 to 15 miles per day and passed through 31 counties in Georgia. The Union column traversed 15 major creeks, streams and rivers that required pontoon bridges. During the march, Slocum&#x27;s troops employed individuals who were newly freed from slavery as pontoon builders and road-building detachments. The average distance of each crossing was 230 feet. Between Sherman&#x27;s two armies, pioneers were required to build over 100 miles of corduroy roads. Weather was relatively clear, as it only rained on two days.

For Slocum&#x27;s Army of Georgia, there were no major battles fought during the Savannah campaign. Most of the actions were, by Union accounts, skirmishes or small actions.

General Sherman&#x27;s Army captured two major cities during the March to the Sea. These cities were Milledgeville, the Capitol of Georgia, and Savannah, Georgia, the principal seaport city of Georgia. Both cities were occupied by the Union Army and there was little destruction of property caused by soldiers. Both cities remained intact. The Union Army, in both cases, was credited with protecting these cities. In Savannah, the mayor of the city and aldermen thanked General Sherman and Slocum&#x27;s subordinate, General Geary.

Upon reaching Savannah, Slocum took the surrender of the city on December 21, 1864. Slocum then set up fire guards and prevented the city of Savannah from being damaged. On December 22, Sherman telegraphed Abraham Lincoln, presenting Savannah as a Christmas present to Lincoln and the Union.

After the capture of the city, Slocum recommended to Sherman that Confederate Gen. William J. Hardee&#x27;s corps, whose only escape route was north over a causeway, be cut off. But Sherman rejected Slocum&#x27;s plan, and Hardee escaped, to fight again at Bentonville.

=== Carolinas Campaign ===
The Carolinas Campaign was launched leaving Savannah in late January 1865. Slocum&#x27;s troops marched a total of 425 miles (684 km) in 50 days. The march had been far more demanding than the March to the Sea, as the terrain was more difficult and there was much more rain. The Confederate forces opposing Sherman&#x27;s army were even smaller than during the Savannah campaign.

In mid-April, Confederate Gen. Johnston met with Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Greensboro, North Carolina. He confessed:

Our people are tired of the war, feel themselves whipped, and will not fight. Our country is overrun, its military resources greatly diminished, while the enemy&#x27;s military power and resources were never greater and may be increased to any extent desired. ... My small force is melting away like snow before the sun.

During the Carolinas Campaign, Slocum&#x27;s army was heavily engaged at the Battle of Averasborough, on March 15–16, 1865, and the Battle of Bentonville, on March 19, 1865, where Slocum successfully held off a surprise assault by Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. After Slocum&#x27;s defeat of the Confederate forces at Bentonville, an officer of Sherman&#x27;s staff wrote: &quot;Slocum was more than equal to the necessity of the hour, and his success justified General Sherman&#x27;s selection of him as commander of the Left Wing of the Army.&quot;

Gen. Joseph E. Johnston surrendered to Gen. Sherman and his army on April 17, 1865, at Bennett&#x27;s farm, Durham Station, North Carolina.

Most of the damage inflicted by Sherman&#x27;s army was in destruction of railroads, factories, cotton supplies and manufacturing, livestock, confiscation of food stores. Sherman imposed strict rules regarding both foraging and destruction of property. The principal loss to the Confederacy was the freeing of individuals from slavery. Estimated Confederate losses: 100 million dollars (1.4 billion in 2010 dollars) – Estimated (General Sherman estimated this damage, but it was not based on any actual tallying of figures); 20 million dollars – General Sherman estimated that this amount was confiscated by the Union Army during the March. The left wing of Sherman&#x27;s march destroyed 125 miles of railroad track.

As a direct result of Sherman&#x27;s March through the South, thousands of slaves left their plantations and workplaces and joined Sherman&#x27;s army as refugees. It is estimated that between 17,000 and 25,000 newly freed enslaved people followed Sherman&#x27;s army during the march through Georgia. It is estimated that 8,000 of these newly freed individuals followed the army into Savannah. In addition, it is estimated that 7,587 individuals were freed from slavery in Savannah and its surrounding areas on December 21, 1864. Wherever Sherman&#x27;s March went throughout Georgia and the Carolina&#x27;s, he was enforcing the provisions of the Emancipation Proclamation.

Both Army commanders under General Sherman were abolitionists who opposed slavery. General Oliver O. Howard of the Army of the Tennessee and General Henry W. Slocum were active in the anti-slavery movement. Several other general officers were abolitionists.

Hundreds of men liberated from slavery served in the columns as teamsters, cooks, and cleared and built roads, etc. They helped in convoys, as wagoneers and teamsters, and helped in various camp duties. They provided service as guides and scouts, provided military intelligence about the position of the Confederate Army. Individuals liberated from slavery also informed Union commanders about where provisions could be found. Union officers praised these highly valued individuals.

Formerly enslaved men also aided escaped Union soldiers.

A Union officer wrote: &quot;What they have done for the Army entitles them to their freedom or whatever they may desire.&quot;

Many of the Union soldiers saw the evils of slavery for the first time. Many of them commented in their letters home that it had changed their ideas about why the war was being fought.

=== End of the War ===
After Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s surrender at Durham Station, North Carolina, General Slocum and the Army of Georgia made their way north to Washington, DC. The XIV and XX Corps participated in the Grand Army Review in Washington, DC, on Wednesday, May 24, 1865.

Slocum commanded the Department of the Mississippi from April through September 1865. In this role, his &quot;General Orders No. 22&quot; appear as attachment number 12 in Carl Schurz&#x27;s 1865 &quot;Report to Congress on the Condition of the South&quot;. The orders countermanded the attempt by the provisional governor of Mississippi, William Sharkey, to form a state militia independent of federal control. The militia was created to prevent newly freed slaves from exercising their rights as citizens. Section VII of his &quot;General Orders No. 10&quot; also appear in this report in attachment number 27. Here he makes it clear that, as long as courts grant equal privileges, ex-slaves are to be regulated by the same criminal statues as other citizens.

With the end of the war, Slocum resigned from the army rather than revert to his prewar rank of colonel, and returned to Syracuse, New York. A year later, the army gave him an offer to come back into service as commander of the 31st US Infantry, but he turned it down.

==Postbellum life==
Slocum ran as the Democratic candidate for Secretary of State of New York in 1865, but was defeated by fellow Gettysburg General Francis C. Barlow. Slocum and his wife, Clara, and family moved to Brooklyn, New York, in 1866. They resided at 465 Clinton Avenue. After resuming work as a lawyer, he declined an offer to return to the U.S. Army as a colonel. In 1868, Slocum was president of New York&#x27;s electoral college. On January 6, 1869, he was elected as a companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

=== Congress ===
Slocum was elected as a Democrat to the 41st and 42nd Congresses (March 4, 1869 – March 3, 1873). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1872. Instead, he resumed the practice of law. In 1882, he was elected Representative at large from New York to the 48th Congress (March 3, 1883 – March 4, 1885). Slocum took an active interest in military and veterans&#x27; affairs. He worked in Congress for the exoneration of Major General Fitz John Porter who was court-martialed after the Second Battle of Bull Run. Slocum gave a strong speech on Porter&#x27;s behalf in Congress on January 18, 1884.

In 1882, Slocum narrowly missed being nominated to be the Democratic candidate for governor of New York. In the first two ballots, Slocum was tied with candidate Roswell P. Flower, a Wall Street lawyer. To break the tie, the convention selected future President Grover Cleveland on the third ballot. In 1885, Slocum was Grand Marshal of President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s first inaugural parade in Washington, D.C.

=== Later career ===
Slocum was a major investor in a number of companies and became director of the People&#x27;s Trust Company, the Williamsburg City Fire Insurance Company, and other successful ventures. Slocum was also a trustee of the Park Savings Bank of Brooklyn, New York, which failed in the depression of 1876.

In 1875, Slocum launched a campaign for civil service reform in the city of Brooklyn. He advocated for the hiring of qualified representatives rather than political appointments.

Slocum was appointed Commissioner of the department of city works of Brooklyn, New York in 1876 and was involved in many civic improvements, from surface transportation to the Brooklyn Bridge.

Slocum was an early advocate for the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, which would link Brooklyn to Manhattan. Slocum went on a study mission to view other bridges built by proposed Brooklyn Bridge designer John Roebling. He was an early investor in the Brooklyn Bridge and was appointed to the Board of Directors. He advocated unsuccessfully for having no bridge tolls. Slocum&#x27;s name is prominent on a bronze tablet that is located on one of the bridge&#x27;s towers.

Slocum was also active in the building of streetcar systems in Brooklyn. He founded and was president of the Brooklyn Crosstown Railroad, which started service in 1872 and became one of the most profitable streetcar lines in the city. In addition, he was a large stockholder in other rail lines and was president of the Brooklyn and Coney Island Railroad Company. He was an early advocate of converting the horse-drawn rail cars to electricity.

In 1877, Slocum was elected president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac, at a reunion in Providence, Rhode Island.

In 1880, Slocum traveled with his family to Europe. In addition to serving again in the Congress (beginning in 1883), Slocum remained active in Civil War veterans&#x27; affairs. He was president of the Board of Trustees of the New York State Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Home in Bath, New York, serving until 1887, and was a member of the New York Monuments Commission for the battlefield of Gettysburg. He served on this commission until his death.

=== Relationship with Sherman ===
Slocum remained friends with Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman until Sherman&#x27;s death in 1891. Both Gen. Oliver Howard and Gen. Slocum planned Sherman&#x27;s funeral and were honorary pall bearers.

=== Retirement ===
Slocum never wrote his memoirs, as had other prominent Union generals. He, however wrote a number of articles about his wartime service for popular magazines, such as &quot;Century Magazine&quot;. These articles were later reprinted in &quot;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War&quot; in 1887.

=== Death ===
Slocum died of liver disease in Brooklyn, New York, on April 14, 1894. He was interred at Green-Wood Cemetery, where Gen. Fitz-John Porter also is interred.

A former member of his staff wrote of him, in memoriam: &quot;In all the sterling qualities that go to make up a man, I have seldom met the equal or superior of Major General Henry W. Slocum. Firm and resolute of purpose, yet with so much modesty, so little of self-assertion; so faithful in the performance of whatever he believed to be his duty; so independent in his speech and conduct, whatever might be the future result.&quot;

==Namesakes==
Equestrian statues of Slocum are located at Steven&#x27;s Knoll and Culp&#x27;s Hill, Gettysburg battlefield (dedicated on September 19, 1902), and in Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn, New York (dedicated on Memorial Day, May 30, 1905).

A steamship, the &quot;General Slocum&quot;, was named for him; it had a disastrous fire on board in 1904 with much loss of life.

Fort Slocum, New York, guarded the entrance to New York Harbor from Long Island Sound from 1867 to 1965 when it was deactivated by the US Army. It was officially named Fort Slocum in 1896.

A United States Army transport ship used for carrying soldiers and equipment during the Spanish–American War was named for General Slocum. It transported troops from San Francisco to the Philippines beginning in 1898.

<text>The First River, in the state of New Jersey in the United States, is a subterranean river and the first main tributary of the Passaic River encountered while travelling upstream from its mouth at Newark Bay.

Beginning at the confluence of Mill Brook and Branch Brook (near the present Skating Center in Branch Brook Park), the First River flowed parallel to Seventh Avenue and Clay Street, discharging into the Passaic River in the vicinity of the Clay Street bridge.

The First River was also known as Mill Brook, having supported several mills, including grist mills for the earliest settlers of Newark in the 17th century.

From 1863 to 1890 the brook was culvertised and now flows underground through two culverts, each high by wide until discharging into the Passaic. The brook once flowed through, and now flows under, what is now Branch Brook Park in the city of Newark.

<doc id="623839" wikidata="Q1189307" url="?curid=623839" title="Naming rights">
<text>Naming rights are a financial transaction and form of advertising or memorialization whereby a corporation, person, or other entity purchases the right to name a facility, object, location, program, or event (most often a sports venue), typically for a defined period of time. For properties such as multi-purpose arenas, performing arts venues, or sports fields, the term ranges from three to 20 years. Longer terms are more common for higher profile venues such as professional sports facilities.

The distinctive characteristic for this type of naming rights is that the buyer gets a marketing property to promote products and services, promote customer retention and/or increase market share.

There are several forms of corporate sponsored names. For example, a &quot;presenting sponsor&quot; attaches the name of the corporation or brand at the end (or, sometimes, beginning) of a generic, usually traditional, name (e.g. Mall of America Field at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome and Smart Araneta Coliseum); or, a &quot;title sponsor&quot; replaces the original name of the property with a corporate-sponsored one (as is the case with most sponsored sports venues), with no reference to the previous name.

==Stadium naming==
Stadium naming may have shifted in recent years to promoting corporate trade names, but in earlier decades is largely traced to the family names of company founders.

The record for the highest amount paid for naming rights belongs to Crypto.com Arena. On 17 November 2021, a 20-year, US$700 million sponsorship deal was reached between Anschutz Entertainment Group and Singapore-based Crypto.com to rename Los Angeles&#x27;s Staples Center (the Staples office supply store chain was the previous naming rights holder to the arena, having held them since the venue&#x27;s opening in 1999). The home of the NHL&#x27;s Los Angeles Kings and NBA&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers became known as Crypto.com Arena on December 25, 2021.

Prior to the Crypto.com Arena deal, the record belonged to Toronto&#x27;s Scotiabank Arena (formerly the Air Canada Centre, which opened in 1999), which garnered a deal of CA$800 million (US$517 million) over 20 years starting in 2018.

The New Meadowlands Stadium, shared home of the New York Giants and New York Jets in East Rutherford, New Jersey, US, was expected to eclipse both deals, with experts estimating it would value US$25–30 million annually. It ultimately fell short of that benchmark, with MetLife Stadium earning $17 million annually from its naming rights deal with MetLife.

Occasionally, the purchaser of a stadium&#x27;s naming rights may choose to donate those rights to an outside organization, typically one to which it is closely related. Probably the most notable example of this is Friends Arena, a major stadium in Stockholm. The facility was originally known as Swedbank Arena, but in 2012 that company donated those rights to the Friends Foundation, an organization heavily sponsored by Swedbank that seeks to combat school bullying. More recently, the Kentucky Farm Bureau, an organization promoting the interests of Kentucky farmers that is best known to the non-farming public for its insurance business, acquired the naming rights to the University of Kentucky&#x27;s new baseball park in 2018. The Farm Bureau in turn donated those naming rights to the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, naming the venue Kentucky Proud Park. The sponsored name is the brand used by said state agency in its marketing campaign for agricultural products produced in that state.

===In the United States===


Naming rights in United States may have been traced back to 1912 with the opening of Fenway Park in Boston. The stadium&#x27;s owner had owned a realty company called &quot;Fenway Realty&quot; (itself, like the stadium, named for a nearby parkland), so the promotional value of the naming may have likely been considered. Despite this, it is more widely believed to have begun in 1926 when William Wrigley, the chewing gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs, named his team&#x27;s stadium &quot;Wrigley Field&quot;. In 1953, Anheuser-Busch head and St. Louis Cardinals owner August Busch, Jr. proposed renaming Sportsman&#x27;s Park, occupied by the Cardinals, &quot;Budweiser Stadium&quot;. When this idea was rejected by Ford Frick, the Commissioner of Baseball at that time, Anheuser-Busch then proposed the title &quot;Busch Stadium&quot; after one of the company&#x27;s founders. The name was readily approved, and Anheuser-Busch subsequently released a new product called &quot;Busch Bavarian Beer&quot; (now known as Busch Beer). The name would later be shifted to the Busch Memorial Stadium in 1966, shortened in the 1970s to &quot;Busch Stadium&quot; and remained the stadium&#x27;s name until it closed in 2005. By that time, Major League Baseball&#x27;s policy had changed – with Coors Field in Denver and Miller Park in Milwaukee going up in that span – and Anheuser-Busch (who retained the naming rights after selling the team) was able to use the same name for the Cardinals&#x27; new stadium which opened on April 4, 2006. Foxboro Stadium, the home of the New England Patriots between 1971 and 2001, was an early example of a team selling naming rights to a company that did not own it, naming the stadium Schaefer Stadium after the beer company from its opening until 1983.

The public reaction to this practice is mixed. Naming rights sold to new venues have largely been accepted, especially if the buyer is well-established and has strong local connections to the area, such as the cases of Rich Stadium (now Highmark BlueCross BlueShield Stadium) in the Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park, Heinz Field (now Acrisure Stadium) in Pittsburgh, and Coors Field in Denver. Selling the naming rights to an already-existing venue has been notably less successful, as in the attempt to rename Candlestick Park in San Francisco to 3Com Park. The general public (and some media outlets) continued to call the facility what it had been known as for over three decades – i.e. Candlestick Park. After the agreement with 3Com expired, the rights were resold to Monster Cable, and the stadium was renamed Monster Park. San Francisco voters responded by passing an initiative (Proposition H) in the November 2004 elections that essentially stipulated the name must revert to Candlestick Park once the contract with Monster expired in 2008. The initiative proved largely ceremonial, however, and it was overturned by the passage of Proposition C in 2009 in response to desperate economic times. The naming rights to the park were never resold and the stadium was closed and demolished in 2014.

===Outside the United States===
Sports stadiums with naming rights deals are most common in but not limited to the United States. &quot;Named&quot; stadiums can be found in countries including Australia, Japan, China, Finland, Canada, Israel and Germany, where 8 of the 10 largest football stadiums have their naming rights sold to corporate sponsors. The practice is widening in the United Kingdom; for instance the current stadium of Bolton Wanderers is the Toughsheet Community Stadium (after 17 years as Reebok Stadium, 4 as Macron Stadium and 5 as the University of Bolton stadium) and Arsenal Football Club&#x27;s stadium (opened for the 2006/2007 season) is the Emirates Stadium, their previous ground being Arsenal Stadium. In cricket, the most famous example is The Oval, home of Surrey County Cricket Club. It has had several sponsors over the years, and is currently known as &quot;The Kia Oval&quot;, having originally been known as the &quot;Kennington Oval&quot;, after the district of London in which it is located.

== Other examples ==

While the highest prices have traditionally been paid for stadium rights, many companies and individuals have found that selling their naming rights can be an important consideration in funding their business. Since the early 2000s, many new categories have opened up, such as the selling of the rights to name a new monkey species for $650,000.

===Public transit===
Naming rights to public transit stations have been sold in Las Vegas and Philadelphia (NRG station, Jefferson Station, and Penn Medicine station). Such sales have been contemplated in New York and Boston, and ruled out in San Francisco. A sponsorship for the MBTA&#x27;s State Street station by Citizens Bank lasted from 1997 to 2000. In Tampa, naming rights for both streetcar stations and rolling stock are available.

In December 2016, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority approved a naming rights policy for its facilities and routes, but later rescinded the policy two months later over potential lawsuits for skipping sponsors.

Examples outside of the United States include Madrid Metro where the metro line Line 2 and the station Sol was renamed from 2013 to 2016 after the mobile phone operator Vodafone, and Monumento Station in the Manila Light Rail Transit System in the Philippines, which was renamed Yamaha Monumento Station on February 14, 2018, after renovations.

===Sports===

Naming rights in the realm of sports is common for both stadiums and sports competitions and series. In addition, some sports teams adopt a name of the sponsor as their team or club name (see List of sports clubs named after a sponsor).

===Competitions===
In association football, leagues and cup competitions sometimes adopt the name of their sponsors. For example, England&#x27;s Premier League was known as the Barclays Premier League until 2016, and its FA Cup is officially the Emirates FA Cup. As part of a rebranding, the Premier League announced in 2015 that it would not accept a title sponsorship beginning in the 2016–17 season, citing a desire to have a cleaner branding more in line with U.S. professional leagues. Since 2020, the French Professional Football Ligue adopted the name of Ligue 1 McDonald&#x27;s.
In college football, most bowl games have modified their traditional names in favor of title sponsors, and in some cases have abandoned their traditional names. While most include their traditional name in some form (e.g. the &quot;Rose Bowl Game presented by Prudential&quot;, &quot;Allstate Sugar Bowl&quot;), some have moved to sponsor-only names (e.g. the Gator Bowl was known for four playings as the TaxSlayer Bowl), a move that generally is treated with consternation from fans. 

Some newer bowl games have only ever had sponsored names; the Sunshine Football Classic in Miami was first played in 1990 as the Blockbuster Bowl, and has gone through multiple sponsorships since, including Carquest, MicronPC, Mazda, Champs Sports, Russell Athletic, Camping World, Cheez-It, and Pop-Tarts. The game briefly included &quot;Tangerine Bowl&quot; in its name following its re-location to Orlando (in an homage to the original branding of the Citrus Bowl), but has since only contained a sponsor in its name. 

Team names and even whole leagues have occasionally been sold to corporate sponsors as well (examples include the New York Red Bulls in the former case, the NET10 Wireless Arena Football League for the latter), but this is generally rare in the United States and more common in other parts of the world.

During the 1980s, sanctioned auto races in NASCAR and IndyCar began to abandon their traditional names in favor of exclusive sponsor names. The trend expanded rapidly in NASCAR such that in 1991, all 29 races in the Winston Cup Series featured sponsor names (including the Daytona 500, which was given a presenting sponsor as the &quot;Daytona 500 by STP&quot;), with little or no reference to the original names. As of the 2010s, very few exceptions remain in NASCAR (such as the Daytona 500, which no longer uses the presenting sponsor), and typically races without sponsor names only lack them because a suitable sponsor could not be secured in enough time. IndyCar follows suit, with most races embracing title sponsorship; the Indianapolis 500 was an exception until 2016, when it added a presenting sponsor for the first time. Sports media coverage (such as ESPN news reports) typically refer to races by the location of the track, avoiding the use of sponsored names in news coverage.

===Media===
Television and radio series, especially in the early days of each medium in the early-mid 20th century, frequently sold the naming rights to their programs to sponsors, most of whom bankrolled the program; examples include &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot;, &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;. This form of sponsorship fell out of favor in the late 1950s, although later examples include &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom&quot;, which originally aired from 1963 to 1988. One of the last surviving examples is the now irregularly-airing &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, on the air since 1951.

===Unofficial naming rights===
The International Star Registry is a commercial company that since 1979 has sold unofficial naming rights to stars (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the astronomical objects). The naming services are limited to an entry in a book, and carry no scientific or official authenticity according to professional astronomers.

== Social connotations ==
In some places, and especially in the UK and United States, the naming or renaming of arenas or events is usually met with disapproval from the general public. Some people see it as an example of a selling out, especially when they see no obvious benefit to themselves. They often refuse to use a new name, preferring instead to use a non-branded name, especially in colloquial situations. Rebranding can also lead to confusion. In such cases, there may be a lengthy period during which the property is known by both names. A common example is Willis Tower in Chicago which was and often still is referred to as the &quot;Sears Tower&quot;, even though the building was sold in 1994 (but retained its former name until 2003).

Some major events—particularly the Olympic and Paralympic Games, as well as FIFA tournaments—prohibit the use of corporately-sponsored names on venues, construing the practice as a form of ambush marketing; affected venues are given a generic name for the duration of the event (e.g., General Motors Place was referred to as &quot;Canada Hockey Place&quot; during the 2010 Winter Olympics), and all sponsored signage is obscured or removed. The Olympics also enforce a strict &quot;clean venue&quot; rule prohibiting most corporate logos—even if official sponsors—from appearing in venues, although the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed in-venue.

Regina, Saskatchewan&#x27;s REAL District was formerly named &quot;Evraz Place&quot;; when discussing its March 2022 rebranding, its owner Regina Exhibition Association Limited (REAL) stated that it had sometimes received shipments and communications meant for the Evraz steel company–mistakenly believing that the company&#x27;s North American division was based there. The contract had actually expired in 2021, but the Russian invasion of Ukraine (Evraz&#x27;s largest shareholder is a Russian businessman) hastened the rebranding. 

== Nonprofit usage ==
A nonprofit organization has the option to recognize a major gift from a donor by bestowing naming rights to a property in recognition of the financial support. This is not a financial transaction in the style of the private sector. For example, in honor of the more than $60 million donated over the years by one donor to the National Air and Space Museum properties, the directors of the Smithsonian Institution chose to name its satellite facility in Loudoun County, Virginia, after the donor, calling it the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.

Walgreen Coast, a portion of the coast of Antarctica, was so named because the Walgreens pharmacy chain sponsored the Byrd Antarctic Expedition.

<text>Coors Field is a baseball stadium in downtown Denver, Colorado. It is the ballpark of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Colorado Rockies. Opened in 1995, the park is located in Denver&#x27;s Lower Downtown neighborhood, two blocks from Union Station. The stadium has a capacity of 50,144 people for baseball.

As an expansion team that began play in 1993, the Rockies spent their first two seasons at Mile High Stadium. During that time, Coors Field was constructed for a cost of $300 million. It includes 63 luxury suites and 4,526 club seats. Coors Field has earned a reputation as a hitter&#x27;s park, due to the effect of Denver&#x27;s high elevation and semi-arid climate on the distances of batted balls. To counter this, the outfield fences have been moved away from home plate, and baseballs used in the park are stored in a humidor.

Coors Field has hosted the 1998 MLB All-Star Game and the 2021 MLB All-Star Game. Coors has also hosted an outdoor hockey game from the 2016 NHL Stadium Series, along with numerous concerts.

In 2017, a consultant determined that Coors Field would require $200 million in capital improvements in the 2020s. To fund those improvements, the Rockies agreed to a long-term lease to develop club-owned nearby land.

==Construction==
Coors Field was the first new stadium added in a six-year period in which Denver&#x27;s sports venues were upgraded, along with Ball Arena (originally Pepsi Center) and Empower Field at Mile High (originally Invesco Field). It was also the first baseball-only park in the National League since Dodger Stadium was built in 1962.

As with the other new venues, Coors Field was constructed with transportation access in mind. It sits near Interstate 25 and has direct access to the 20th Street and Park Avenue exits. Nearby Union Station also provides light rail and commuter rail access, as well as local and regional bus lines.

Coors Field was originally planned to be somewhat smaller, seating only 43,800. However, after the Rockies drew almost 4.5 million people in their first season at Mile High Stadium – the most in baseball history – the plans were altered during construction, and new seats in the right field upper deck were added.

The center field bleacher section is named &quot;The Rockpile&quot;. During the 1993 and 1994 seasons when the team played at Mile High Stadium, which was a hybrid football/baseball venue, the Rockpile was located next to the south stands, which were in dead center field and very distant from home plate. The same design was incorporated into Coors Field, and is located in deep center field up high. The original Rockpile seats cost a dollar each.

During construction, workers discovered a number of dinosaur fossils throughout the grounds. Rumors circulated that these fossils included a triceratops skull. In reality, the fossil fragments discovered were quite small, and are now housed at the Museum of Science and Nature. Because of these discoveries, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was one of the first names to be considered for the stadium. This later led to the selection of a triceratops as the Rockies&#x27; mascot, Dinger.

In 1991, Coors Brewing purchased naming rights &quot;in perpetuity&quot; to the stadium as part of their $30 million investment in the Rockies. A 2017 lease agreement that Rockies club ownership signed with the stadium district ensured that the name would remain at least through 2047.

==Features==

While most of the seats in Coors Field are dark green, the seats in the 20th row of the upper deck are purple to mark the elevation of one mile (5280 ft; 1,609 m) above sea level.
The Blue Moon Brewery at The Sandlot is a microbrewery/restaurant that is behind the right-field stands, with an entrance from Coors Field, and from Blake Street. The brewery is operated by the Coors Brewing Company, and experiments with craft beers on a small scale. The Brewery has won multiple awards at the Great American Beer Festival in various categories. The popular Blue Moon, a Belgian-Style Wheat beer was invented here, and is now mass-produced by Coors. The restaurant is housed in a building that is attached to the stadium. Coors Field has an extensive selection of food items. Selections include Rockie dogs, Denver dogs, vegetarian dogs and burgers, and all of the usual ball park items.

Behind the center field wall is a landscape decoration that reflects the typical environment of the Rocky Mountains. This landscape area consists of a waterfall, fountains, and pine trees. After a Rockies home run or win, the fountains shoot high into the air.

The park has two large light emitting diode (LED) video displays and one ribbon display in the outfield from Daktronics. The top display, underneath the &quot;Rockies&quot; logo, measures . The second display measure and is used to give lineups and statistics and as a scoreboard. The field also contains several Daktronics ribbon displays, totaling approximately in length.

After the close of the 2013 season, renovations began on the right field portion of the upper deck, converted into an outdoor party deck for 2014.

===Reputation as a home run-friendly park===
At above sea level, Coors Field is by far the highest park in the majors. The next-highest, Chase Field in Phoenix, stands at . Designers knew that the stadium would give up a lot of home runs, as the lower air density at such a high elevation would result in balls traveling farther than in other parks. To compensate for this, the outfield fences were placed at an unusually far distance from home plate, thus creating the largest outfield in Major League Baseball. In spite of the pushed-back fences, for many years Coors Field not only gave up the most home runs in baseball, but due to the resultant large field area, the most doubles and triples as well.

In its first decade, the above-average number of home runs earned Coors Field a reputation as the most hitter-friendly park in Major League Baseball, earning the critical nicknames &quot;Coors Canaveral&quot; (a reference to Cape Canaveral, from where NASA launches spacecraft) and &quot;Williamsport&quot; (referring to the site of the Little League World Series, which has been traditionally dominated by batters). Prior to the 2002 baseball season, studies determined that &quot;dry&quot; air rather than &quot;thin&quot; air had a greater contribution to the increased frequency of home runs. It was found that baseballs stored in damper air are softer and therefore less elastic to the impact of the bat. To address this problem, a secure room-sized humidor was installed to have a damper place to store the baseballs prior to games. Since its introduction, the number of home runs at Coors Field has decreased and is now nearly the same as other parks.

Regardless of ball humidity, elevation is still a factor in games at Coors Field. The ball does slip more easily through the thin air allowing for longer hits. In addition, the curveball tends to curve less with the thin air than at sea level leading to fewer strikeouts and fewer effective pitches for pitchers to work with.

Coors Field twice broke the major league record for home runs hit in a ballpark in one season. The previous record, 248, had been set at the Angels&#x27; original home of Wrigley Field in Los Angeles in 1961, its only year for major league ball. In Coors Field&#x27;s first year, the home run total fell just 7 short of that mark, despite losing 9 games from the home schedule (or 1/9 of the normal 81) due to the strike that had continued from 1994. The next season, 1996, with a full schedule finally, 271 home runs were hit at Coors Field. In 1999, the current major league record was set at 303. The annual home run figure dropped noticeably in 2002, and has dropped below 200 starting in 2005.

Although the number of home runs hit per season at Coors Field is decreasing, Coors Field still remains the most hitter friendly ballpark in the Major Leagues by a wide margin. From 2012 to 2015, the Colorado Rockies led the league in runs scored in home games, while being last in the league for runs scored in away games. This demonstrates the extreme benefit that Coors Field&#x27;s low air density provides to hitters.

One concern for the Rockies has been poor adjustment when playing road games at lower altitudes. The Rockies score an average of just 3.9 runs per road game, the lowest among all teams. This has had a detrimental effect on Colorado&#x27;s all-time road record, which sits at , or 39.6%, the worst in the majors.

Rockies pitchers are more likely to finish with an ERA of at least 4, if not higher, and only Ubaldo Jiménez and Jhoulys Chacín
maintained sub-4 ERAs during their Rockies tenure (3.66 and 3.84 respectively).

====Increased Fence Height====
In order to combat the concerns of a home run friendly ballpark and to attract free agent pitchers, the Rockies raised two portions of the outfield fences prior to the 2016 season. The sections of fence that were raised were specifically chosen to not interfere with the view of the field from the grandstand. From right field to center field in front of the bullpens the fence was raised 8 feet 9 inches to a height of 16 feet 6 inches, consistent with the height of the out of town scoreboard. In the left field corner the fence was raised five feet to a total height of thirteen feet from the foul pole to the pavilion seating section.

Analysis after the 2016 season showed that the new fences had very little effect. One study showed that the new fences only came into play twenty times; one play changed what would have been a ground rule double into a triple. The number of home runs in the 2016 season was actually greater than the 2015 season. The new fences had the most effect on right handed batters.

==Notable events==

===MLB===

On September 17, 1996, Hideo Nomo of the Los Angeles Dodgers threw the first of his two career no-hit games as the Dodgers won 9–0. Nomo&#x27;s first no-hitter at Coors Field is of special note due to the park&#x27;s overwhelming hitter-friendly reputation (before the usage of the humidors, even), it being the only one thrown there through the 2024 season, as well as Nomo pitching for the visiting team; while still a fairly new park at the time, the Rockies started out in the similarly elevated Mile High Stadium and would naturally be more accustomed to Coors Field&#x27;s nuances such as the larger fielding area as it is their home field.

The 1998 and 2021 Major League Baseball All-Star Games took place in Coors Field.

In 2011, a man fell to his death when he was attempting to slide down a stair railing during the 7th inning of a Rockies-Diamondbacks game.

On April 23, 2013, Rockies and Braves played in the coldest game since MLB began tracking game time temperature in 1991, at .

There have been eleven 1–0 games in Coors Field history, through April 6, 2023. The first 1–0 game at Coors Field was on July 9, 2005, meaning all eleven games have occurred since Major League Baseball allowed the Rockies to start using a humidor on May 15, 2002:

===Ice Hockey===

Coors Field also hosted three outdoor ice hockey games in February 2016. First, on February 20, the local Denver Pioneers defeated their arch-rival Colorado College 4–1 in a college match billed as the &quot;Battle on Blake&quot;. Then, one week later on February 27, the Colorado Avalanche lost to the Detroit Red Wings 5–3 as part of the 2016 NHL Stadium Series. The day before that also hosted the Alumni exhibition game where the Colorado Avalanche alumni defeated their Detroit Red Wings counterparts.
==The &quot;Voice&quot; of Coors Field==
Alan Roach was the main PA announcer since Coors Field opened in 1995. In the spring preceding the 2007 Rockies season, Roach announced his retirement from his post at Coors Field to spend more time over the summer with his family. He did come back to substitute in 2008. Roach is also the PA announcer for the nearby Colorado Avalanche hockey team of the NHL and former PA announcer for the Denver Broncos of the NFL. He also provides voice-overs for local sports introductions in the region, in addition to hosting a local sports talk radio show. He is currently the PA announcer for the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL. He is also one of the voices of the train system at Denver International Airport, and has also been heard as the PA announcer at recent Super Bowls. Reed Saunders, 23, was chosen to be the new voice of Coors Field on March 16, 2007.

==In popular culture==
Coors Field was featured in the movie &quot;The Fan&quot; (1996) starring Robert De Niro and Wesley Snipes. The ballpark was also featured in two episodes of &quot;South Park&quot;: &quot;Professor Chaos&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Losing Edge&quot; (2005).

&quot;Acclaim Sports Park&quot;, featured on &quot;All-Star Baseball 2004&quot; and &quot;2005&quot;, is a mirrored image of Coors Field.

<text>Chalahgawtha (or, more commonly in English, Chillicothe( ) was the name of one of the five divisions (or bands) of the Shawnee, a Native American people, during the 18th century. It was also the name of the principal village of the division. The other four divisions were the Mekoche, Kispoko, Pekowi, and Hathawekela. (All five division names have been spelled in a great variety of ways.) Together these divisions formed the loose confederacy that was the Shawnee tribe.

==Chillicothe division==

By tradition, each Shawnee division had certain roles it performed on behalf of the entire tribe. These customs were fading by the time they were recorded in writing by European Americans. The Chillicothe division often provided political leadership for the tribe. A well-known Chillicothe leader was Chief Blackfish.

==Chillicothe villages==
The village where the chief of the Chillicothe division lived was also known as &quot;Chillicothe&quot;. When this principal village was relocated, often as a result of war or the expansion of European-American settlement, the new village would be again be known as &quot;Chillicothe&quot;. Not all the Shawnee living in the town belonged to the Chillicothe division. They also tolerated residents from tribes other than the Shawnee. As a result of naming their communities in this way, there are numerous Shawnee Chillicothe villages in the historical record. This has occasionally caused some confusion to researchers.

===Chillicothes on the Scioto===
Lower Shawnee Town, as it was called by European-American colonists, was a large town on the Ohio River, founded about 1734 by Shawnee. The Shawnee name of the town was not recorded, but scholars believe it may have been &quot;Chillicothe&quot;. The town grew to be a major trading hub in the years leading up to the French and Indian War. But it was of lesser political importance than Logstown, which was upriver on the Ohio. Members from most, if not all five Shawnee divisions, lived in the town, as well as an assortment of other Native Americans, Europeans, and African Americans. It had an estimated total population of 1,200 or more people. Lower Shawnee Town was abandoned in 1758, after the population relocated north into central Ohio to avoid attack by the Virginia militia.

The next Chillicothe (1758–1787) was one of seven Shawnee villages developed on the west bank of the Scioto River, near Paint Creek and what developed as modern Chillicothe, Ohio. The village was settled in the late 1750s by survivors of the floods at Lower Shawnee Town and the burning of Logstown, at a time when Shawnee were returning to the Ohio Country after having been driven out and scattered by the Iroquois decades earlier in competition over the fur trade.

Cheeseekau, older brother of Tecumseh, was probably born here about 1761. Tecumseh may have been born here in 1768, or at nearby Kisposko town. In 1762, Chillicothe contained about 300 warriors (representing a total of perhaps 1,200 people). The majority of Shawnee then living in Ohio lived there.

European influences, especially in trade goods such as guns, kettles, and clothing, were prevalent among the Shawnee at this time. David Jones, an Anglican missionary, visited the town in 1773 and noted that a British fur trader named Moses Henry lived there.

In the early 1770s, the Shawnee towns on the Scioto were the focus of a Shawnee-led movement formed to resist colonial expansion onto their traditional hunting grounds following the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix. The Shawnee were ultimately unsuccessful in forging a large alliance, however. They fought Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1774 with little support from other tribes. An army from Virginia marched to the Scioto villages and forced the Shawnee to accept the boundary established in the Stanwix treaty.

After the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, many Chillicothe residents relocated northwest to form a village on the Little Miami River. Shawnee villagers continued to live on the Scioto, along with some Cherokee, until the village was attacked by Americans in 1787 during the Northwest Indian War, after the establishment of the United States.

===Old Chillicothe===
Because of its prominence in the American Revolutionary War, Old Chillicothe (1774–1780) was the most famous of the Shawnee Chillicothe villages in American history. It is often referred to in historical writing as &quot;Old Chillicothe&quot;, in order to distinguish it from the modern Ohio city of Chillicothe. Settlement of the village began in 1774. Located on the Little Miami River, the area is now known as Oldtown, near present-day Xenia.

Chillicothe was the home of Blackfish, war chief of the division. From here the Shawnee staged numerous raids into Kentucky, where they hoped to drive out the American settlers. Frontiersman Daniel Boone was captured in Kentucky in 1778 by Chief Blackfish and brought to Chillicothe with other prisoners. Boone was adopted into the tribe and lived for several months at Chillicothe. According to tradition the village was the birthplace of Tecumseh, who became a famous Shawnee leader responsible for creating a large alliance among tribes in the late eighteenth century. But Tecumseh was born in 1768, before this Chillicothe was settled. As mentioned above, he was likely born at a village on the Scioto River.

There were raids across the Ohio on both sides during the American Revolutionary War. After Chief Blackfish unsuccessfully besieged Boonesborough, Kentucky in 1778, Americans crossed the Ohio River and attacked Chillicothe on May 29, 1779. Blackfish successfully defended the town, but was shot in the leg and later died when the wound became infected. In 1780, in retaliation for Bird&#x27;s invasion of Kentucky, George Rogers Clark led the Kentucky militia up the Little Miami River. The Shawnee and other residents abandoned Chillicothe as Clark approached. Clark burned the town and destroyed the surrounding crops. (By some accounts, the Shawnee had burned the town before fleeing, to deny the Kentucky militia plunder and supplies.) Clark marched further north and fought a battle at Pekowi town, where he defeated the Shawnee.

===Other Chillicothes===

Chillicothe was resettled on the Great Miami River (1780–1782) after the destruction of the previous village. Although a British army surrendered at Yorktown in October 1781, the war on the frontier continued unabated. In Kentucky, the Americans were defeated at the Battle of Blue Licks in August 1782, the worst defeat of the war for the soldiers of Kentucky. In retaliation, in November Clark led another expedition into Ohio, the last major campaign of the war. His forces destroyed Chillicothe and four other villages.

The next Chillicothe was on the St. Mary&#x27;s River (1783–1790). Another Chillicothe (1788–1792) was located on the Maumee River, near present Fort Wayne, Indiana. A Chillicothe (1787–?) was located on the west bank of the Mississippi River, north of present Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

<text>The Requiem in D minor, K. 626, is a Requiem Mass by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791). Mozart composed part of the Requiem in Vienna in late 1791, but it was unfinished at his death on 5 December the same year. A completed version dated 1792 by Franz Xaver Süssmayr was delivered to Count Franz von Walsegg, who had commissioned the piece for a requiem service on 14 February 1792 to commemorate the first anniversary of the death of his wife Anna at the age of 20 on 14 February 1791.

The autograph manuscript shows the finished and orchestrated movement of Introit in Mozart&#x27;s hand, and detailed drafts of the Kyrie and the sequence of Dies irae as far as the first eight bars of the Lacrimosa, and the Offertory. It cannot be shown to what extent Süssmayr may have depended on now lost &quot;scraps of paper&quot; for the remainder; he later claimed the Sanctus and Benedictus and the Agnus Dei as his own.

Walsegg probably intended to pass the Requiem off as his own composition, as he is known to have done with other works. This plan was frustrated by a public benefit performance for Mozart&#x27;s widow Constanze. She was responsible for a number of stories surrounding the composition of the work, including the claims that Mozart received the commission from a mysterious messenger who did not reveal the commissioner&#x27;s identity, and that Mozart came to believe that he was writing the Requiem for his own funeral.

In addition to the Süssmayr version, a number of alternative completions have been developed by composers and musicologists in the 20th and 21st centuries.

== Instrumentation ==
The Requiem is scored for 2 basset horns in F, 2 bassoons, 2 trumpets in D, 3 trombones (alto, tenor, and bass), timpani (2 drums), violins, viola, and basso continuo (cello, double bass, and organ). The basset horn parts are sometimes played on conventional BB or A clarinets and sometimes the related alto clarinet, even though this changes the sonority.

The vocal forces consist of soprano, contralto, tenor, and bass soloists and an SATB mixed choir.

==Structure==

Süssmayr&#x27;s completion divides the Requiem into eight sections:
:



All sections from the Sanctus onwards are not present in Mozart&#x27;s manuscript fragment. Mozart may have intended to include the &quot;Amen&quot; fugue at the end of the Sequentia, but Süssmayr did not do so in his completion.

The following table shows for the eight sections in Süssmayr&#x27;s completion with their subdivisions: the title, vocal parts (solo soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B) [in bold] and four-part choir SATB), tempo, key, and meter.

== Music ==
=== I. Introitus ===

The Requiem begins with a seven-measure instrumental introduction, in which the woodwinds (first bassoons, then basset horns) present the principal theme of the work in imitative counterpoint. The first five measures of this passage (without the accompaniment) are shown below.

This theme is modeled after Handel&#x27;s &quot;The ways of Zion do mourn&quot;, HWV 264. Many parts of the work make reference to this passage, notably in the coloratura in the Kyrie fugue and in the conclusion of the Lacrymosa.

The trombones then announce the entry of the choir, which breaks into the theme, with the basses alone for the first measure, followed by imitation by the other parts. The chords play off syncopated and staggered structures in the accompaniment, thus underlining the solemn and steady nature of the music. A soprano solo is sung to the &quot;Te decet hymnus&quot; text in the &quot;tonus peregrinus&quot;. The choir continues, repeating the psalmtone while singing the &quot;Exaudi orationem meam&quot; section. Then, the principal theme is treated by the choir and the orchestra in downward-gliding sixteenth-notes. The courses of the melodies, whether held up or moving down, change and interlace amongst themselves, while passages in counterpoint and in unison (e.g., &quot;Et lux perpetua&quot;) alternate; all this creates the charm of this movement, which finishes with a half cadence on the dominant.

===II. Kyrie===

The Kyrie follows without pause (&quot;attacca&quot;). It is a double fugue on the famous theme of the cross (connecting the four notes shows the shape of the cross) used by many composers, such as Bach, Handel, and Haydn. The counter-subject comes from the final chorus of the Dettingen Anthem, HWV 265. The first three measures of the altos and basses are shown below.

The contrapuntal motifs of the theme of this fugue include variations on the two themes of the Introit. At first, upward diatonic series of sixteenth-notes are replaced by chromatic series, which has the effect of augmenting the intensity. This passage shows itself to be a bit demanding in the upper voices, particularly for the soprano voice. A final portion in a slower (Adagio) tempo ends on an &quot;empty&quot; fifth, a construction which had during the classical period become archaic, lending the piece an ancient air.

===III. Sequentia===
====a. Dies irae====

The Dies irae (&quot;Day of Wrath&quot;) opens with a show of orchestral and choral might with tremolo strings, syncopated figures and repeated chords in the brass. A rising chromatic scurry of sixteenth-notes leads into a chromatically rising harmonic progression with the chorus singing &quot;Quantus tremor est futurus&quot; (&quot;what trembling there will be&quot; in reference to the Last Judgment). This material is repeated with harmonic development before the texture suddenly drops to a trembling unison figure with more tremolo strings evocatively painting the &quot;Quantus tremor&quot; text.

====b. Tuba mirum====
Mozart&#x27;s textual inspiration is again apparent in the Tuba mirum (&quot;Hark, the trumpet&quot;) movement, which is introduced with a sequence of three notes in arpeggio, played in B major by a solo tenor trombone, unaccompanied, in accordance with the usual German translation of the Latin &quot;tuba&quot;, &quot;Posaune&quot; (trombone). Two measures later, the bass soloist enters, imitating the same theme. At 7, there is a fermata, the only point in all the work at which a solo cadenza occurs. The final quarter notes of the bass soloist herald the arrival of the tenor, followed by the alto and soprano in dramatic fashion.

On the text &quot;Cum vix justus sit securus&quot; (&quot;When only barely may the just one be secure&quot;), there is a switch to a homophonic segment sung by the quartet at the same time, articulating, without accompaniment, the &quot;cum&quot; and &quot;vix&quot; on the &quot;strong&quot; (1st and 3rd), then on the &quot;weak&quot; (2nd and 4th) beats, with the violins and continuo responding each time; this &quot;interruption&quot; (which one may interpret as the interruption preceding the Last Judgment) is heard &quot;sotto voce&quot;, &quot;forte&quot; and then &quot;piano&quot; to bring the movement finally into a crescendo into a perfect cadence.

====c. Rex tremendae====

A descending melody composed of dotted notes is played by the orchestra to announce the &quot;Rex tremendae majestatis&quot; (&quot;King of tremendous majesty&quot;, i.e., God), who is called by powerful cries from the choir on the syllable &quot;Rex&quot; during the orchestra&#x27;s pauses. For a surprising effect, the &quot;Rex&quot; syllables of the choir fall on the second beats of the measures, even though this is the &quot;weak&quot; beat. The choir then adopts the dotted rhythm of the orchestra, forming what Wolff calls baroque music&#x27;s form of &quot;topos of the homage to the sovereign&quot;, or, more simply put, that this musical style is a standard form of salute to royalty, or, in this case, divinity. This movement consists of only 22 measures, but this short stretch is rich in variation: homophonic writing and contrapuntal choral passages alternate many times and finish on a quasi-unaccompanied choral cadence, landing on an open D chord (as seen previously in the Kyrie).

====d. Recordare====

At 130 measures, the Recordare (&quot;Remember&quot;) is the work&#x27;s longest movement, as well as the first in triple meter (); the movement is a setting of no fewer than seven stanzas of the &quot;Dies irae&quot;. The form of this piece is somewhat similar to sonata form, with an exposition around two themes ( 1–37), a development of two themes (mm. 38–92) and a recapitulation (mm. 93–98).

In the first 13 measures, the basset horns are the first to present the first theme, clearly inspired by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach&#x27;s Sinfonia in D Minor, the theme is enriched by a magnificent counterpoint by cellos in descending scales that are reprised throughout the movement. This counterpoint of the first theme prolongs the orchestral introduction with chords, recalling the beginning of the work and its rhythmic and melodic shiftings (the first basset horn begins a measure after the second but a tone higher, the first violins are likewise in sync with the second violins but a quarter note shifted, etc.). The introduction is followed by the vocal soloists; their first theme is sung by the alto and bass (from 14), followed by the soprano and tenor (from m. 20). Each time, the theme concludes with a hemiola (mm. 18–19 and 24–25). The second theme arrives on &quot;Ne me perdas&quot;, in which the accompaniment contrasts with that of the first theme. Instead of descending scales, the accompaniment is limited to repeated chords. This exposition concludes with four orchestral measures based on the counter-melody of the first theme (mm. 34–37).

The development of these two themes begins in 38 on &quot;Quaerens me&quot;; the second theme is not recognizable except by the structure of its accompaniment. At m. 46, it is the first theme that is developed beginning from &quot;Tantus labor&quot; and concludes with two measures of hemiola at mm. 50–51. After two orchestral bars (mm. 52–53), the first theme is heard again on the text &quot;Juste Judex&quot; and ends on a hemiola in mm. 66–67. Then, the second theme is reused on &quot;ante diem rationis&quot;; after the four measures of orchestra from 68 to 71, the first theme is developed alone.

The recapitulation intervenes in 93. The initial structure reproduces itself with the first theme on the text &quot;Preces meae&quot; and then in m. 99 on &quot;Sed tu bonus&quot;. The second theme reappears one final time on m. 106 on &quot;Sed tu bonus&quot; and concludes with three hemiolas. The final measures of the movement recede to simple orchestral descending contrapuntal scales.

====e. Confutatis====

The Confutatis (&quot;From the accursed&quot;) begins with a rhythmic and dynamic sequence of strong contrasts and surprising harmonic turns. Accompanied by the basso continuo, the tenors and basses burst into a &quot;forte&quot; vision of the infernal, on a dotted rhythm. The accompaniment then ceases alongside the tenors and basses, and the sopranos and altos enter softly and &quot;sotto voce&quot;, singing &quot;Voca me cum benedictis&quot; (&quot;Call upon me with the blessed&quot;) with an arpeggiated accompaniment in strings.

Finally, in the following stanza (&quot;Oro supplex et acclinis&quot;), there is a striking modulation from A minor to A minor.

This spectacular descent from the opening key is repeated, now modulating to the key of F major. A final dominant seventh chord leads to the Lacrymosa.

==== f. Lacrimosa ====

The chords begin &quot;piano&quot; on a rocking rhythm in , intercut with quarter rests, which will be reprised by the choir after two measures, on &quot;Lacrimosa dies illa&quot; (&quot;This tearful day&quot;). Then, after two measures, the sopranos begin a diatonic progression, in disjointed eighth-notes on the text &quot;resurget&quot; (&quot;will be reborn&quot;), then &quot;legato&quot; and chromatic on a powerful crescendo. The choir is &quot;forte&quot; by 8, at which point Mozart&#x27;s contribution to the movement is interrupted by his death.

Süssmayr brings the choir to a reference of the Introit and ends on an &quot;Amen&quot; cadence. Discovery of a fragmentary &quot;Amen&quot; fugue in Mozart&#x27;s hand has led to speculation that it may have been intended for the Requiem. Indeed, many modern completions (such as Levin&#x27;s) complete Mozart&#x27;s fragment. Some sections of this movement are quoted in the Requiem Mass of Franz von Suppé, who was a great admirer of Mozart. Ray Robinson, the music scholar and president (from 1969 to 1987) of the Westminster Choir College, suggests that Süssmayr used materials from Credo of one of Mozart&#x27;s earlier Masses, Mass in C major, K. 220 &quot;Sparrow&quot; in completing this movement.

=== IV. Offertorium ===

====a. Domine Jesu====

The first movement of the Offertorium, the Domine Jesu, begins on a &quot;piano&quot; theme consisting of an ascending progression on a G minor triad. This theme will later be varied in various keys, before returning to G minor when the four soloists enter a canon on &quot;Sed signifer sanctus Michael&quot;, switching between minor (in ascent) and major (in descent). Between these thematic passages are &quot;forte&quot; phrases where the choir enters, often in unison and dotted rhythm, such as on &quot;Rex gloriae&quot; (&quot;King of glory&quot;) or &quot;de ore leonis&quot; (&quot;[Deliver them] from the mouth of the lion&quot;). Two choral fugues follow, on &quot;ne absorbeat eas tartarus, ne cadant in obscurum&quot; (&quot;may Tartarus not absorb them, nor may they fall into darkness&quot;) and &quot;Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semini eius&quot; (&quot;What once to Abraham you promised and to his seed&quot;). The movement concludes homophonically in G major.

====b. Hostias====

The Hostias opens in E major in , with fluid vocals. After 20 measures, the movement switches to an alternation of &quot;forte&quot; and &quot;piano&quot; exclamations of the choir, while progressing from B major towards B minor, then F major, D major, A major, F minor, C minor and E major. An overtaking chromatic melody on &quot;Fac eas, Domine, de morte transire ad vitam&quot; (&quot;Make them, O Lord, cross over from death to life&quot;) finally carries the movement into the dominant of G minor, followed by a reprise of the &quot;Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semini eius&quot; fugue.

The words &quot;Quam olim da capo&quot; are likely to have been the last Mozart wrote; this portion of the manuscript has been missing since it was stolen at 1958 World&#x27;s Fair in Brussels by a person whose identity remains unknown.

===Süssmayr&#x27;s additions===
====V. Sanctus====

The Sanctus is the first movement written entirely by Süssmayr, and the only movement of the Requiem to have a key signature with sharps: D major, generally used for the entry of trumpets in the Baroque era. After a succinct glorification of the Lord follows a short fugue in on &quot;Hosanna in excelsis&quot; (&quot;Glory [to God] in the highest&quot;), noted for its syncopated rhythm, and for its motivic similarity to the &quot;Quam olim Abrahae&quot; fugue.

====VI. Benedictus====

The Benedictus, a quartet, adopts the key of the submediant, B major (which can also be considered the relative of the subdominant of the key of D minor). The Sanctus&#x27;s ending on a D major cadence necessitates a mediant jump to this new key.

The Benedictus is constructed on three types of phrases: the (A) theme, which is first presented by the orchestra and reprised from 4 by the alto and from m. 6 by the soprano. The word &quot;benedictus&quot; is held, which stands in opposition with the (B) phrase, which is first seen at m. 10, also on the word &quot;benedictus&quot; but with a quick and chopped-up rhythm. The phrase develops and rebounds at m. 15 with a broken cadence. The third phrase, (C), is a solemn ringing where the winds respond to the chords with a staggering harmony, as shown in a Mozartian cadence at mm. 21 and 22, where the counterpoint of the basset horns mixes with the line of the cello. The rest of the movement consists of variations on this writing. At m. 23, phrase (A) is reprised on a F pedal and introduces a recapitulation of the primary theme from the bass and tenor from mm. 28 and 30, respectively. Phrase (B) follows at m. 33, although without the broken cadence, then repeats at m. 38 with the broken cadence once more. This carries the movement to a new Mozartian cadence in mm. 47 to 49 and concludes on phrase (C), which reintroduces the &quot;Hosanna&quot; fugue from the Sanctus movement, in the new key of the Benedictus.

====VII. Agnus Dei====

Homophony dominates the Agnus Dei. The text is repeated three times, always with chromatic melodies and harmonic reversals, going from D minor to F major, C major, and finally B major. According to the musicologist Simon P. Keefe, Süssmayr likely referenced one of Mozart&#x27;s earlier Masses, Mass in C major, K. 220 &quot;Sparrow&quot; in completing this movement.

====VIII. Communio====
Süssmayr here reuses Mozart&#x27;s first two movements, almost exactly note for note, with wording corresponding to this part of the liturgy.

==History==
=== Composition ===

At the time of Mozart&#x27;s death on 5 December 1791, only the first movement, Introitus (Requiem aeternam) was completed in all of the orchestral and vocal parts. The Kyrie, Sequence and Offertorium were completed in skeleton, with the exception of the Lacrymosa, which breaks off after the first eight bars. The vocal parts and continuo were fully notated. Occasionally, some of the prominent orchestral parts were briefly indicated, such as the first violin part of the Rex tremendae and Confutatis, the musical bridges in the Recordare, and the trombone solos of the Tuba Mirum.

What remained to be completed for these sections were mostly accompanimental figures, inner harmonies, and orchestral doublings to the vocal parts.

=== Completion by Mozart&#x27;s contemporaries ===
The eccentric count Franz von Walsegg commissioned the Requiem from Mozart anonymously through intermediaries. The count, an amateur chamber musician who routinely commissioned works by composers and passed them off as his own, wanted a Requiem Mass he could claim he composed to memorialize the recent passing of his wife. Mozart received only half of the payment in advance, so upon his death his widow Constanze was keen to have the work completed secretly by someone else, submit it to the count as having been completed by Mozart and collect the final payment. Joseph von Eybler was one of the first composers to be asked to complete the score, and had worked on the movements from the Dies irae up until the Lacrymosa. In addition, a striking similarity between the openings of the Domine Jesu Christe movements in the requiems of the two composers suggests that Eybler at least looked at later sections. After this work, he felt unable to complete the remainder and gave the manuscript back to Constanze Mozart.

The task was then given to another composer, Franz Xaver Süssmayr. Süssmayr borrowed some of Eybler&#x27;s work in making his completion, and added his own orchestration to the movements from the Kyrie onward, completed the Lacrymosa, and added several new movements which a Requiem would normally comprise: Sanctus, Benedictus, and Agnus Dei. He then added a final section, Lux aeterna by adapting the opening two movements which Mozart had written to the different words which finish the Requiem Mass, which according to both Süssmayr and Mozart&#x27;s wife was done according to Mozart&#x27;s directions. Some people consider it unlikely, however, that Mozart would have repeated the opening two sections if he had survived to finish the work.

Other composers may have helped Süssmayr. The Agnus Dei is suspected by some scholars to have been based on instruction or sketches from Mozart because of its similarity to a section from the Gloria of a previous Mass (&quot;Sparrow Mass&quot;, K. 220) by Mozart, as was first pointed out by Richard Maunder. Others have pointed out that at the beginning of the Agnus Dei, the choral bass quotes the main theme from the Introitus. Many of the arguments dealing with this matter, though, center on the perception that if part of the work is of high quality, it must have been written by Mozart (or from sketches), and if part of the work contains errors and faults, it must have been all Süssmayr&#x27;s doing.

Another controversy is the suggestion (originating from a letter written by Constanze) that Mozart left explicit instructions for the completion of the Requiem on &quot;a few scraps of paper with music on them... found on Mozart&#x27;s desk after his death.&quot; The extent to which Süssmayr&#x27;s work may have been influenced by these &quot;scraps&quot;, if they existed at all, remains a subject of speculation amongst musicologists to this day.

The completed score, started by Mozart but largely finished by Süssmayr, was then dispatched to Count Walsegg complete with a counterfeited signature of Mozart and dated 1792. The various complete and incomplete manuscripts eventually turned up in the 19th century, but many of the figures involved left ambiguous statements on record as to how they were involved in the affair. Despite the controversy over how much of the music is actually Mozart&#x27;s, the commonly performed Süssmayr version has become widely accepted by the public. This acceptance is quite strong, even when alternative completions provide logical and compelling solutions for the work.

=== Promotion by Constanze Mozart ===
The confusion surrounding the circumstances of the Requiem&#x27;s composition was created in large part by Mozart&#x27;s wife, Constanze.

Constanze had a difficult task: she had to keep secret the fact that the Requiem was unfinished at Mozart&#x27;s death, so she could collect the final payment from the commission. For a period of time, she also needed to keep secret that Süssmayr had anything to do with the composition of the Requiem, to allow Count Walsegg the impression that Mozart wrote the work entirely himself. Once she received the commission, she needed to carefully promote the work as Mozart&#x27;s so she could continue to receive revenue from its publication and performance. During this phase of the Requiem&#x27;s history, it was still important that the public accept that Mozart wrote the whole piece, as it would fetch larger sums from publishers and the public if it were completely by Mozart.

It is Constanze&#x27;s efforts that created the half-truths and myths after Mozart&#x27;s death. According to Constanze, Mozart declared that he was composing the Requiem for himself and that he had been poisoned. His symptoms worsened, and he began to complain about the painful swelling of his body and high fever. Nevertheless, Mozart continued his work on the Requiem, and even on the last day of his life, he was explaining to his assistant how he intended to finish the Requiem.

With deception surrounding the Requiem&#x27;s completion, a natural outcome is the mythologizing which occurred. One series of myths surrounding the Requiem involves the role Antonio Salieri played in commissioning and completion of the Requiem (and in Mozart&#x27;s death generally). While a retelling of this myth is Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot; and the movie made from it, it is important to note that the source of misinformation was actually a 19th-century play by Alexander Pushkin, &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;, which was turned into an opera by Rimsky-Korsakov and subsequently used as the framework for the play &quot;Amadeus&quot;.

=== Conflicting accounts ===
Source materials written soon after Mozart&#x27;s death contain serious discrepancies, which leave a level of subjectivity when assembling the &quot;facts&quot; about Mozart&#x27;s composition of the Requiem. For example, at least three of the conflicting sources, all dated within two decades following Mozart&#x27;s death, cite Constanze as their primary source of interview information.

==== Friedrich Rochlitz ====
In 1798, Friedrich Rochlitz, a German biographical author and amateur composer, published a set of Mozart anecdotes that he claimed to have collected during his meeting with Constanze in 1796. The Rochlitz publication makes the following statements:
* Mozart was unaware of his commissioner&#x27;s identity at the time he accepted the project.
* He was not bound to any date of completion of the work.
* He stated that it would take him around four weeks to complete.
* He requested, and received, 100 ducats at the time of the first commissioning message.
* He began the project immediately after receiving the commission.
* His health was poor from the outset; he fainted multiple times while working.
* He took a break from writing the work to visit the Prater with his wife.
* He shared the thought with his wife that he was writing this piece for his own funeral.
* He spoke of &quot;very strange thoughts&quot; regarding the unpredicted appearance and commission of this unknown man.
* He noted that the departure of Leopold II to Prague for the coronation was approaching.

The most highly disputed of these claims is the last one, the chronology of this setting. According to Rochlitz, the messenger arrives quite some time before the departure of Leopold for the coronation, yet there is a record of his departure occurring in mid-July 1791. However, as Constanze was in Baden during all of June to mid-July, she would not have been present for the commission or the drive they were said to have taken together. Furthermore, &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; (except for the Overture and March of the Priests) was completed by mid-July. &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; was commissioned by mid-July. There was no time for Mozart to work on the Requiem on the large scale indicated by the Rochlitz publication in the time frame provided.

==== Franz Xaver Niemetschek ====

Also in 1798, Constanze is noted to have given another interview to Franz Xaver Niemetschek, another biographer looking to publish a compendium of Mozart&#x27;s life. He published his biography in 1808, containing a number of claims about Mozart&#x27;s receipt of the Requiem commission:
* Mozart received the commission very shortly before the Coronation of Emperor Leopold II and before he received the commission to go to Prague.
* He did not accept the messenger&#x27;s request immediately; he wrote the commissioner and agreed to the project stating his fee but urging that he could not predict the time required to complete the work.
* The same messenger appeared later, paying Mozart the sum requested plus a note promising a bonus at the work&#x27;s completion.
* He started composing the work upon his return from Prague.
* He fell ill while writing the work
* He told Constanze &quot;I am only too conscious... my end will not be long in coming: for sure, someone has poisoned me! I cannot rid my mind of this thought.&quot;
* Constanze thought that the Requiem was overstraining him; she called the doctor and took away the score.
* On the day of his death, he had the score brought to his bed.
* The messenger took the unfinished Requiem soon after Mozart&#x27;s death.
* Constanze never learned the commissioner&#x27;s name.

This account, too, has fallen under scrutiny and criticism of its accuracy. According to letters, Constanze most certainly knew the name of the commissioner by the time this interview was released in 1800. Additionally, the Requiem was not given to the messenger until some time after Mozart&#x27;s death. This interview contains the only account from Constanze herself of the claim that she took the Requiem away from Wolfgang for a significant duration during his composition of it. Otherwise, the timeline provided in this account is historically probable.

==== Georg Nikolaus von Nissen ====
However, the most highly accepted text attributed to Constanze is the interview to her second husband, Georg Nikolaus von Nissen. After Nissen&#x27;s death in 1826, Constanze released the biography of Wolfgang (1828) that Nissen had compiled, which included this interview. Nissen states:
* Mozart received the commission shortly before the coronation of Emperor Leopold and before he received the commission to go to Prague.
* He did not accept the messenger&#x27;s request immediately; he wrote the commissioner and agreed to the project stating his fee but urging that he could not predict the time required to complete the work.
* The same messenger appeared later, paying Mozart the sum requested plus a note promising a bonus at the work&#x27;s completion.
* He started composing the work upon his return from Prague.

The Nissen publication lacks information following Mozart&#x27;s return from Prague.

== Influences ==

Mozart esteemed Handel and in 1789 he was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten to rearrange &quot;Messiah&quot; (HWV 56). This work likely influenced the composition of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem; the Kyrie is based on the &quot;And with His stripes we are healed&quot; chorus from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;, since the subject of the fugato is the same with only slight variations by adding ornaments on melismata. However, the same four-note theme is also found in the finale of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s String Quartet in F minor (Op. 20 No. 5) and in the first measure of the A minor fugue from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; Book 2 (BWV 889b) as part of the subject of Bach&#x27;s fugue, and it is thought that Mozart transcribed some of the fugues of the &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; for string ensemble (K. 404a Nos. 1–3 and K. 405 Nos. 1–5), but the attribution of these transcriptions to Mozart is not certain.

Some musicologists believe that the Introitus was inspired by Handel&#x27;s &quot;Funeral Anthem for Queen Caroline&quot;, HWV 264. Another influence was Michael Haydn&#x27;s Requiem in C minor; Mozart and his father were viola and violin players respectively at its first three performances in January 1772. Some have noted that Michael Haydn&#x27;s Introitus sounds rather similar to Mozart&#x27;s, and the theme for Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Quam olim Abrahae&quot; fugue is a direct quote of the fugue theme from Haydn&#x27;s Offertorium and Versus from his aforementioned requiem. In Introitus m. 21, the soprano sings &quot;Te decet hymnus Deus in Zion&quot;. It is quoting the Lutheran hymn &quot;&quot;. The melody is used by many composers e.g. in Bach&#x27;s cantata &quot;Meine Seel erhebt den Herren&quot;, BWV 10 but also in Michael Haydn&#x27;s Requiem.

Felicia Hemans&#x27; poem &quot;Mozart&#x27;s Requiem&quot; was first published in &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; in 1828.

==Timeline==
== Modern completions ==
Since the 1970s several composers and musicologists, dissatisfied with the traditional &quot;Süssmayr&quot; completion, have attempted alternative completions of the Requiem.

== The &quot;Amen&quot; fugue ==

In the 1960s, a sketch for an Amen Fugue was discovered, which some musicologists (Levin, Maunder) believe belongs to the Requiem at the conclusion of the sequence after the Lacrymosa. H. C. Robbins Landon argues that this Amen Fugue was not intended for the Requiem, rather that it &quot;may have been for a separate unfinished mass in D minor&quot; to which the Kyrie K. 341 also belonged.

There is, however, compelling evidence placing the Amen Fugue in the Requiem based on current Mozart scholarship. First, the principal subject is the main theme of the Requiem (stated at the beginning, and throughout the work) in strict inversion. Second, it is found on the same page as a sketch for the Rex tremendae (together with a sketch for the overture of his last opera &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;), and thus surely dates from late 1791. The only place where the word &#x27;Amen&#x27; occurs in anything that Mozart wrote in late 1791 is in the sequence of the Requiem. Third, as Levin points out in the foreword to his completion of the Requiem, the addition of the Amen Fugue at the end of the sequence results in an overall design that ends each large section with a fugue.

==Autograph at the 1958 World&#x27;s Fair==

The autograph of the Requiem was placed on display at the World&#x27;s Fair in 1958 in Brussels. At some point during the fair, someone was able to gain access to the manuscript, tearing off the bottom right-hand corner of the second to last page (folio 99r/45r), containing the words &quot;Quam olim d: C:&quot; (an instruction that the &quot;Quam olim&quot; fugue of the &quot;Domine Jesu&quot; was to be repeated da capo, at the end of the Hostias). The perpetrator has not been identified, and the fragment has not been recovered.

If the most common authorship theory is true, then &quot;Quam olim d: C:&quot; were the last words Mozart wrote before he died.

== Recordings ==
==Arrangements==
The Requiem and its individual movements have been repeatedly arranged for various instruments. The keyboard arrangements notably demonstrate the variety of approaches taken to translating the Requiem, particularly the Confutatis and Lacrymosa movements, in order to balance preserving the Requiem&#x27;s character while also being physically playable. Karl Klindworth&#x27;s piano solo (c.1900), Muzio Clementi&#x27;s organ solo, and Renaud de Vilbac&#x27;s harmonium solo (c.1875) are liberal in their approach to achieve this. In contrast, Carl Czerny wrote his piano transcription for two players, enabling him to retain the extent of the score, if sacrificing timbral character. Franz Liszt&#x27;s piano solo (c.1865) departs the most in terms of fidelity and character of the Requiem, through its inclusion of composition devices used to showcase pianistic technique.

<text>Aaron ben Moses ben Asher (; 10th century, died c. 960) was a sofer (Jewish scribe) who lived in Tiberias. He perfected the Tiberian system of writing vowel sounds in Hebrew. The system is still in use today, serving as the basis for grammatical analysis.

== Biography ==
Aaron ben Moses ben Asher lived and worked in the city of Tiberias, on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. He was descended from a long line of Masoretes, starting with someone called Asher, but nothing is known about them other than their names. His father, Moses ben Asher, is credited with writing the Cairo Codex of the Prophets (895 CE). If authentic, it is among the oldest manuscripts containing a large proportion of the Hebrew Bible. 

=== Questions about possible Karaite ancestry ===

Scholars have long debated as to whether Aaron ben Asher was a Karaite. While many modern scholars lean toward this being true, there is no clear consensus, and so the question remains open.

The idea was first suggested in 1860 by Simhah Pinsker, who argued that Masoretes in general should be ‘suspected’ of being Karaites since they seem to have devoted all of their time to the Bible and showed no interest in rabbinic Midrash or Talmud, which at times contradicts the Masoretic Text. Numerous other pieces of circumstantial evidence were presented to make a strong case, however not strong enough to tip the scales and end the debate.

Some examples of evidence for this assertion include:

* Strong parallels to Karaite theology in the way both Aaron and his father Moshe write about all three parts of the Hebrew Bible being equally authoritative in terms of &quot;halakha&quot; (a classic Karaite position);
* The Masoretic Text does not follow the order set down in the Talmud (Isaiah after Ezekiel), which was accepted as authoritative by Rabbanites, but rejected by the Karaites (the Masoretic Text also differs from verses quoted in the Talmud);
* The Codex contains a prayer for the protection of a temple (presumably referring to the Karaite temple, as the Rabbanites did not have a temple at the time);
* Writings of the time refer to the Ben Ashers with honorifics more typically used by Karaites (such as &quot;melamed&quot; (teacher) and &quot;maskil&quot; (&#x27;enlightened one&#x27;);
* Indications that the Codex Cairensis, thought to have been written by his father, was sponsored by a Karaite (based on language used by the sponsor);
* The Codex was in the possession of the Karaites since the time of its inscribed dedication (even before they ransomed it from the crusaders).

A turning point came in the 1950s when Benjamin Klar discovered that an anti-Karaite polemical poem by Sa‘adia Gaon criticized a Karaite masorete by the name of &quot;ben Asher&quot;. This agrees with Sa‘adia&#x27;s rejection of ben Asher in favor of the rival school of ben Naftali, as well as the fact that ben Asher became accepted as relations between the Karaites and Rabbanites improved. Aron Dotan has dealt with many of the arguments, including Klar&#x27;s, and also argued that the approval of Maimonides is evidence against the claim. However, according to Zer, few researchers have expressed their support for Dotan&#x27;s position.

== Works ==

Ben Asher was the first systematic Hebrew grammarian. In an age where Hebrew grammatical principles were not considered worthy of independent study, he was the first to take this discipline seriously. His &quot;Sefer Dikdukei ha-Te&#x27;amim&quot; (&#x27;Grammatical Analysis of the Accents&#x27;) was an original collection of grammatical rules and Masoretic information. 

Ben Asher added &quot;mesorah&quot; (vowelization and cantillation notes) to the Aleppo Codex, correcting its letter-text according to the Masoretic Text.
The value of this work is that the grammatical rules presented by ben Asher reveal the linguistic background of vocalization for the first time. 

== Legacy ==
For over a thousand years, ben Asher has been regarded by Jews of all persuasions as having produced the most accurate version of the Masoretic Text. Since his day, handwritten manuscripts and printed versions of the Hebrew Bible have, for the most part, followed his system. 

Maimonides accepted the views of ben Asher only in regard to open and closed sections, but apparently admired his work generally and helped to establish and spread his authority. Referring to a Bible manuscript then in Egypt, Maimonides wrote: &quot;All relied on it, since it was corrected by ben Asher and was worked on and analyzed by him for many years, and was proofread many times in accordance with the masorah, and I based myself on this manuscript in the &quot;Sefer Torah&quot; that I wrote&quot;.

Umberto Cassuto used the Aleppo Codex as the basis of his edition of the Hebrew Bible.

<text>George Perle (6 May 1915 – 23 January 2009) was an American composer and music theorist. As a composer, his music was largely atonal, using methods similar to the twelve-tone technique of the Second Viennese School. This serialist style, and atonality in general, was the subject of much of his theoretical writings. His 1962 book, &quot;Serial Composition and Atonality: An Introduction to the Music of Schoenberg, Berg, and Webern&quot; remains a standard text for 20th-century classical music theory. Among Perle&#x27;s awards was the 1986 Pulitzer Prize for Music for his Wind Quintet No. 4.

==Life and career==
Perle was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, to Russian Jewish parents. He graduated from DePaul University, where he studied with Wesley LaViolette and received private lessons from Ernst Krenek. Later, he served as a technician fifth grade in the United States Army during World War II. He earned his doctorate at New York University in 1956.

Perle composed with a technique of his own devising called &quot;twelve-tone tonality&quot;. This technique was different from, but related to, the twelve-tone technique of the Second Viennese School, of which he was an &quot;early admirer&quot; and whose techniques he used aspects of but never fully adopted. Perle&#x27;s former student Paul Lansky described Perle&#x27;s twelve-tone tonality thus:

In 1968, Perle cofounded the Alban Berg Society with Igor Stravinsky, and Hans F. Redlich, who had the idea (according to Perle in his letter to Glen Flax of 4/1/89). Perle&#x27;s important work on Berg includes documenting that the third act of &quot;Lulu&quot;, rather than being an unfinished sketch, was actually three-fifths complete and that the &quot;Lyric Suite&quot; contains a secret program dedicated to Berg&#x27;s love-affair.

After retiring from Queens College in 1985, he became a professor emeritus at the Aaron Copland School of Music. In 1986, Perle was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Music for his Wind Quintet No. 4 and also a MacArthur Fellowship. In about 1989 Perle became composer-in-residence for the San Francisco Symphony, a three-year appointment. It was also around this time that he had published his fourth book entitled &quot;The Listening Composer&quot;.

He died aged 93 in his home in New York City in January 2009. He was buried in Calverton National Cemetery.

A growing number of younger artists have come to express their appreciation for Perle. In the run-up to his 100th birthday celebrations the composer-pianist Michael Brown released a well received CD of a sampling of Perle&#x27;s work for piano.

Perle was married to the sculptor Laura Slobe from 1940 to 1952; the couple were members of the Socialist Workers Party. His second wife, Barbara Philips, died in 1978. Perle married Shirley Xenia Gabis in 1982.

==Works==
Richard Swift differentiates between Perle&#x27;s &#x27;free&#x27; or &#x27;intuitive&#x27;, tone-centered, and twelve-tone modal music. He lists Perle&#x27;s tone-centered compositions:
*Sonata for Solo Viola (1942)
*Three Sonatas for Solo Clarinet (1943)
*Hebrew Melodies for Solo Cello (1945)
*Sonata for Solo Cello (1947)
*Quintet for Strings (1958)
*Sonata I for Solo Violin (1959)
*Wind Quintet I (1959)
*Wind Quintet II (1960)
*Monody I for Flute (1962)
*Monody II for Double Bass (1962)
*Three Inventions for Bassoon (1962)
*Sonata II for Solo Piano (1963)
*Solo Partita for Violin and Viola (1965)
*Wind Quintet III (1967)

<doc id="623865" wikidata="Q310518" url="?curid=623865" title="Franz Xaver Süssmayr">
<text>Franz Xaver Süssmayr or Süßmayr (; 1766 – September 17, 1803), also anglicized as Suessmayr, was an Austrian composer and conductor. Popular in his day, he is now known primarily as the composer who completed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s unfinished Requiem. In addition, there have been performances of Süssmayr&#x27;s operas at Kremsmünster, and his secular political cantata (1796), &quot;Der Retter in Gefahr&quot;, SmWV 302, received its first full performance in over 200 years in June 2012 in a new edition by Mark Nabholz, conducted by Terrence Stoneberg. There are also CD recordings of his unfinished clarinet concerto (completed by Michael Freyhan), one of his German requiems, and his Missa Solemnis in D.
==Works==
His works include the following:
* String Trio in D Minor (SmWV 613)
* Two masses (SmWV 101–102)
* Two requiems (SmWV 103–104)
* Seven offertories (SmWV 112–115, 117–119, 123, 125, 144–145, 156)
* A gradual (SmWV 143)
* Psalms
* A magnificat
* Hymns
* &quot;Agonia e morte di Mozart&quot; (fantasia for piano)
* &quot;Nicht mehr als sechs Schüsseln&quot; (SmWV 205)
* &quot;Moses oder der Auszug aus Ägypten&quot; (SmWV 209)
* &quot;Der Spiegel von Arkadien&quot; (SmWV 213)
* &quot;List und Zufall&quot; (SmWV 224)
* &quot;Soliman oder die drei Sultaninnen&quot; (SmWV 219). Beethoven used a theme from this opera for his Variations on &#x27;Tändeln und Scherzen&#x27;, WoO 76.

Of special note may be the clarinet concerto (SmWV 501) he most probably wrote for Mozart&#x27;s clarinetist Anton Stadler, because it was scored for the basset clarinet. Recordings of the work by Dieter Klöcker (on Novalis) on &quot;normal clarinet&quot; and by Thea King (on Hyperion) in a reconstructed version for basset clarinet by Michael Freyhan are available. In 2021 a completion appropriate for period basset clarinet was published by Craig Hill.

=== Ballet ===
* &quot;&quot;, ballet by Salvatore Viganò, premiered at La Scala on 25 April 1812. It gave an inspiration to Niccolò Paganini for creating &quot;Le Streghe&quot;, Variations on a theme from the ballet &quot;Il noce di Benevento&quot; (Op. 8, 1813).

<doc id="623866" wikidata="Q853421" url="?curid=623866" title="Quantitative trait locus">
<text>A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a locus (section of DNA) that correlates with variation of a quantitative trait in the phenotype of a population of organisms. QTLs are mapped by identifying which molecular markers (such as SNPs or AFLPs) correlate with an observed trait. This is often an early step in identifying the actual genes that cause the trait variation.

==Definition==
A quantitative trait locus (QTL) is a region of DNA which is associated with a particular phenotypic trait, which varies in degree and which can be attributed to polygenic effects, i.e., the product of two or more genes, and their environment. These QTLs are often found on different chromosomes. The number of QTLs which explain variation in the phenotypic trait indicates the genetic architecture of a trait. It may indicate that plant height is controlled by many genes of small effect, or by a few genes of large effect.

Typically, QTLs underlie continuous traits (those traits which vary continuously, e.g. height) as opposed to discrete traits (traits that have two or several character values, e.g. red hair in humans, a recessive trait, or smooth vs. wrinkled peas used by Mendel in his experiments).

Moreover, a single phenotypic trait is usually determined by many genes. Consequently, many QTLs are associated with a single trait.
Another use of QTLs is to identify candidate genes underlying a trait. The DNA sequence of any genes in this region can then be compared to a database of DNA for genes whose function is already known, this task being fundamental for marker-assisted crop improvement.

==History==
Mendelian inheritance was rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century. As Mendel&#x27;s ideas spread, geneticists began to connect Mendel&#x27;s rules of inheritance of single factors to Darwinian evolution. For early geneticists, it was not immediately clear that the smooth variation in traits like body size (i.e., incomplete dominance) was caused by the inheritance of single genetic factors. Although Darwin himself observed that inbred features of fancy pigeons were inherited in accordance with Mendel&#x27;s laws (although Darwin did not actually know about Mendel&#x27;s ideas when he made the observation), it was not obvious that these features selected by fancy pigeon breeders can similarly explain quantitative variation in nature.

An early attempt by William Ernest Castle to unify the laws of Mendelian inheritance with Darwin&#x27;s theory of speciation invoked the idea that species become distinct from one another as one species or the other acquires a novel Mendelian factor. Castle&#x27;s conclusion was based on the observation that novel traits that could be studied in the lab and that show Mendelian inheritance patterns reflect a large deviation from the wild type, and Castle believed that acquisition of such features is the basis of &quot;discontinuous variation&quot; that characterizes speciation. Darwin discussed the inheritance of similar mutant features but did not invoke them as a requirement of speciation. Instead Darwin used the emergence of such features in breeding populations as evidence that mutation can occur at random within breeding populations, which is a central premise of his model of selection in nature. Later in his career, Castle would refine his model for speciation to allow for small variation to contribute to speciation over time. He also was able to demonstrate this point by selectively breeding laboratory populations of rats to obtain a hooded phenotype over several generations.

Castle&#x27;s was perhaps the first attempt made in the scientific literature to direct evolution by artificial selection of a trait with continuous underlying variation, however the practice had previously been widely employed in the development of agriculture to obtain livestock or plants with favorable features from populations that show quantitative variation in traits like body size or grain yield.

Castle&#x27;s work was among the first to attempt to unify the recently rediscovered laws of Mendelian inheritance with Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. Still, it would be almost thirty years until the theoretical framework for evolution of complex traits would be widely formalized. In an early summary of the theory of evolution of continuous variation, Sewall Wright, a graduate student who trained under Castle, summarized contemporary thinking about the genetic basis of quantitative natural variation: &quot;As genetic studies continued, ever smaller differences were found to mendelize, and any character, sufficiently investigated, turned out to be affected by many factors.&quot; Wright and others formalized population genetics theory that had been worked out over the preceding 30 years explaining how such traits can be inherited and create stably breeding populations with unique characteristics. Quantitative trait genetics today leverages Wright&#x27;s observations about the statistical relationship between genotype and phenotype in families and populations to understand how certain genetic features can affect variation in natural and derived populations.

==Quantitative traits==

Polygenic inheritance refers to inheritance of a phenotypic characteristic (trait) that is attributable to two or more genes and can be measured quantitatively. Multifactorial inheritance refers to polygenic inheritance that also includes interactions with the environment. Unlike monogenic traits, polygenic traits do not follow patterns of Mendelian inheritance (discrete categories). Instead, their phenotypes typically vary along a continuous gradient depicted by a bell curve.

An example of a polygenic trait is human skin color variation. Several genes factor into determining a person&#x27;s natural skin color, so modifying only one of those genes can change skin color slightly or in some cases, such as for SLC24A5, moderately. Many disorders with genetic components are polygenic, including autism, cancer, diabetes and numerous others. Most phenotypic characteristics are the result of the interaction of multiple genes.
Multifactorially inherited diseases are said to constitute the majority of genetic disorders affecting humans which will result in hospitalization or special care of some kind.

===Multifactorial traits in general===
Traits controlled both by the environment and by genetic factors are called multifactorial.
Usually, multifactorial traits outside of illness result in what we see as continuous characteristics in organisms, especially human organisms such as: height, skin color, and body mass. All of these phenotypes are complicated by a great deal of give-and-take between genes and environmental effects. The continuous distribution of traits such as height and skin color described above, reflects the action of genes that do not manifest typical patterns of dominance and recessiveness. Instead the contributions of each involved locus are thought to be additive. Writers have distinguished this kind of inheritance as &quot;polygenic&quot;, or &quot;quantitative inheritance&quot;.

Thus, due to the nature of polygenic traits, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or dihybrid cross. Polygenic inheritance can be explained as Mendelian inheritance at many loci, resulting in a trait which is normally-distributed. If &quot;n&quot; is the number of involved loci, then the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;)&quot;2n&quot; will give the frequency of distribution of all &quot;n&quot; allele combinations. For sufficiently high values of &quot;n&quot;, this binomial distribution will begin to resemble a normal distribution. From this viewpoint, a disease state will become apparent at one of the tails of the distribution, past some threshold value. Disease states of increasing severity will be expected the further one goes past the threshold and away from the mean.

===Heritable disease and multifactorial inheritance===
A mutation resulting in a disease state is often recessive, so both alleles must be mutant in order for the disease to be expressed phenotypically. A disease or syndrome may also be the result of the expression of mutant alleles at more than one locus. When more than one gene is involved, with or without the presence of environmental triggers, we say that the disease is the result of multifactorial inheritance.

The more genes involved in the cross, the more the distribution of the genotypes will resemble a normal, or Gaussian distribution. This shows that multifactorial inheritance is polygenic, and genetic frequencies can be predicted by way of a polyhybrid Mendelian cross. Phenotypic frequencies are a different matter, especially if they are complicated by environmental factors.

The paradigm of polygenic inheritance as being used to define multifactorial disease has encountered much disagreement. Turnpenny (2004) discusses how simple polygenic inheritance cannot explain some diseases such as the onset of Type I diabetes mellitus, and that in cases such as these, not all genes are thought to make an equal contribution.

The assumption of polygenic inheritance is that all involved loci make an equal contribution to the symptoms of the disease. This should result in a normal (Gaussian) distribution of genotypes. When it does not, the idea of polygenetic inheritance cannot be supported for that illness.

===Examples===
The above are well-known examples of diseases having both genetic and environmental components. Other examples involve atopic diseases such as eczema or dermatitis, spina bifida (open spine), and anencephaly (open skull).

While schizophrenia is widely believed to be multifactorially genetic by biopsychiatrists, no characteristic genetic markers have been determined with any certainty.

If it is shown that the brothers and sisters of the patient have the disease, then there is a strong chance that the disease is genetic and that the patient will also be a genetic carrier. This is not quite enough as it also needs to be proven that the pattern of inheritance is non-Mendelian. This would require studying dozens, even hundreds of different family pedigrees before a conclusion of multifactorial inheritance is drawn. This often takes several years.

If multifactorial inheritance is indeed the case, then the chance of the patient contracting the disease is reduced only if cousins and more distant relatives have the disease. While multifactorially-inherited diseases tend to run in families, inheritance will not follow the same pattern as a simple monohybrid or dihybrid cross.

If a genetic cause is suspected and little else is known about the illness, then it remains to be seen exactly how many genes are involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease. Once that is determined, the question must be answered: if two people have the required genes, why are there differences in expression between them? Generally, what makes the two individuals different are likely to be environmental factors. Due to the involved nature of genetic investigations needed to determine such inheritance patterns, this is not usually the first avenue of investigation one would choose to determine etiology.

==QTL mapping==

For organisms whose genomes are known, one might now try to exclude genes in the identified region whose function is known with some certainty not to be connected with the trait in question. If the genome is not available, it may be an option to sequence the identified region and determine the putative functions of genes by their similarity to genes with known function, usually in other genomes. This can be done using BLAST, an online tool that allows users to enter a primary sequence and search for similar sequences within the BLAST database of genes from various organisms. It is often not the actual gene underlying the phenotypic trait, but rather a region of DNA that is closely linked with the gene

Another interest of statistical geneticists using QTL mapping is to determine the complexity of the genetic architecture underlying a phenotypic trait. For example, they may be interested in knowing whether a phenotype is shaped by many independent loci, or by a few loci, and do those loci interact. This can provide information on how the phenotype may be evolving.

In a recent development, classical QTL analyses were combined with gene expression profiling i.e. by DNA microarrays. Such expression QTLs (eQTLs) describe cis- and trans-controlling elements for the expression of often disease-associated genes. Observed epistatic effects have been found beneficial to identify the gene responsible by a cross-validation of genes within the interacting loci with metabolic pathway- and scientific literature databases.

===Analysis of variance===
The simplest method for QTL mapping is analysis of variance (ANOVA, sometimes called &quot;marker regression&quot;) at the marker loci. In this method, in a backcross, one may calculate a t-statistic to compare the averages of the two marker genotype groups. For other types of
crosses (such as the intercross), where there are more than two possible genotypes, one uses a more general form of ANOVA, which provides a so-called F-statistic. The ANOVA approach for QTL mapping has three important weaknesses. First, we do not receive separate estimates of QTL location and QTL effect. QTL location is indicated only by looking at which markers give the greatest differences between genotype group averages, and the apparent QTL effect at a marker will be smaller than the true QTL effect as a result of recombination between the marker and the QTL. Second, we must discard individuals whose genotypes are missing at the marker. Third, when the markers are widely spaced, the QTL may be quite far from all markers, and so the power for QTL detection will decrease.

===Interval mapping===
Lander and Botstein developed interval mapping, which overcomes the three disadvantages of analysis of variance at marker loci. Interval mapping is currently the most popular approach for QTL mapping in experimental crosses. The method makes use of a genetic map of the typed markers, and, like analysis of variance, assumes the presence of a single QTL. In interval mapping, each locus is considered one at a time and the logarithm of the odds ratio (LOD score) is calculated for the model that the given locus is a true QTL. The odds ratio is related to the Pearson correlation coefficient between the phenotype and the marker genotype for each individual in the experimental cross.

The term &#x27;interval mapping&#x27; is used for estimating the position of a QTL within two markers (often indicated as &#x27;marker-bracket&#x27;). Interval mapping is originally based on the maximum likelihood but there are also very good approximations possible with simple regression.

The principle for QTL mapping is:
1) The likelihood can be calculated for a given set of parameters (particularly QTL effect and QTL position) given the observed data on phenotypes and marker genotypes.
2) The estimates for the parameters are those where the likelihood is highest.
3) A significance threshold can be established by permutation testing.

Conventional methods for the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are based on a comparison of single QTL models with a model assuming no QTL. For instance in the &quot;interval mapping&quot; method the likelihood for a single putative QTL is assessed at each location on the genome. However, QTLs located elsewhere on the genome can have an interfering effect. As a consequence, the power of detection may be compromised, and the estimates of locations and effects of QTLs may be biased (Lander and Botstein 1989; Knapp 1991). Even nonexisting so-called &quot;ghost&quot; QTLs may appear (Haley and Knott 1992; Martinez and Curnow 1992). Therefore, multiple QTLs could be mapped more efficiently and more accurately by using multiple QTL models. One popular approach to handle QTL mapping where multiple QTL contribute to a trait is to iteratively scan the genome and add known QTL to the regression model as QTLs are identified. This method, termed composite interval mapping determine both the location and effects size of QTL more accurately than single-QTL approaches, especially in small mapping populations where the effect of correlation between genotypes in the mapping population may be problematic.
===Composite interval mapping (CIM)===

In this method, one performs interval mapping using a subset of marker loci as covariates. These markers serve as proxies for other QTLs to increase the resolution of interval mapping, by accounting for linked QTLs and reducing the residual variation. The key problem with CIM concerns the choice of suitable marker loci to serve as covariates; once these have been chosen, CIM turns the model selection problem into a single-dimensional scan. The choice of marker covariates has not been solved, however. Not surprisingly, the appropriate markers are those closest to the true QTLs, and so if one could find these, the QTL mapping problem would be complete anyway.

Inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) has also been proposed as a potential method for QTL mapping.

===Family-pedigree based mapping===
Family-based QTL mapping, or Family-pedigree based mapping (Linkage and association mapping), involves multiple families instead of a single family. Family-based QTL mapping has been the only way for mapping of genes where experimental crosses are difficult to make. However, due to some advantages, now plant geneticists are attempting to incorporate some of the methods pioneered in human genetics. Using family-pedigree based approach has been discussed (Bink et al. 2008). Family-based linkage and association has been successfully implemented (Rosyara et al. 2009)

<text>In chemistry and physics, Raman scattering or the Raman effect () is the inelastic scattering of photons by matter, meaning that there is both an exchange of energy and a change in the light&#x27;s direction. Typically this effect involves vibrational energy being gained by a molecule as incident photons from a visible laser are shifted to lower energy. This is called &quot;normal Stokes-Raman scattering&quot;. 

Light has a certain probability of being scattered by a material. When photons are scattered, most of them are elastically scattered (Rayleigh scattering), such that the scattered photons have the same energy (frequency, wavelength, and therefore color) as the incident photons, but different direction. Rayleigh scattering usually has an intensity in the range 0.1% to 0.01% relative to that of a radiation source. An even smaller fraction of the scattered photons (about 1 in a million) can be scattered &quot;inelastically&quot;, with the scattered photons having an energy different (usually lower) from those of the incident photons—these are Raman scattered photons. Because of conservation of energy, the material either gains or loses energy in the process.

The effect is exploited by chemists and physicists to gain information about materials for a variety of purposes by performing various forms of Raman spectroscopy. Many other variants of Raman spectroscopy allow rotational energy to be examined, if gas samples are used, and electronic energy levels may be examined if an X-ray source is used, in addition to other possibilities. More complex techniques involving pulsed lasers, multiple laser beams and so on are known.

The Raman effect is named after Indian scientist C. V. Raman, who discovered it in 1928 with assistance from his student K. S. Krishnan. Raman was awarded the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of Raman scattering.

== History ==

The elastic light scattering phenomena called Rayleigh scattering, in which light retains its energy, was described in the 19th century. The intensity of Rayleigh scattering is about 10−3 to 10−4 compared to the intensity of the exciting source. In 1908, another form of elastic scattering, called Mie scattering was discovered.

The inelastic scattering of light was predicted by Adolf Smekal in 1923 and in older German-language literature it has been referred to as the Smekal-Raman-Effekt. In 1922, Indian physicist C. V. Raman published his work on the &quot;Molecular Diffraction of Light&quot;, the first of a series of investigations with his collaborators that ultimately led to his discovery (on 16 February 1928) of the radiation effect that bears his name. The Raman effect was first reported by Raman and his coworker K. S. Krishnan, and independently by Grigory Landsberg and Leonid Mandelstam, in Moscow on 21 February 1928 (5 days after Raman and Krishnan). In the former Soviet Union, Raman&#x27;s contribution was always disputed; thus in Russian scientific literature the effect is usually referred to as &quot;combination scattering&quot; or &quot;combinatory scattering&quot;. Raman received the Nobel Prize in 1930 for his work on the scattering of light.

In 1998 the Raman effect was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in recognition of its significance as a tool for analyzing the composition of liquids, gases, and solids.

==Instrumentation==

Modern Raman spectroscopy nearly always involves the use of lasers as an exciting light source. Because lasers were not available until more than three decades after the discovery of the effect, Raman and Krishnan used a mercury lamp and photographic plates to record spectra. Early spectra took hours or even days to acquire due to weak light sources, poor sensitivity of the detectors and the weak Raman scattering cross-sections of most materials. The most common modern detectors are charge-coupled devices (CCDs). Photodiode arrays and photomultiplier tubes were common prior to the adoption of CCDs.

== Theory ==
The following focuses on the theory of normal (non-resonant, spontaneous, vibrational) Raman scattering of light by discrete molecules. X-ray Raman spectroscopy is conceptually similar but involves excitation of electronic, rather than vibrational, energy levels.

===Molecular vibrations===

Raman scattering generally gives information about vibrations within a molecule. In the case of gases, information about rotational energy can also be gleaned. For solids, phonon modes may also be observed. The basics of infrared absorption regarding molecular vibrations apply to Raman scattering although the selection rules are different.

====Degrees of freedom====

For any given molecule, there are a total of 3 degrees of freedom, where is the number of atoms. This number arises from the ability of each atom in a molecule to move in three dimensions. When dealing with molecules, it is more common to consider the movement of the molecule as a whole. Consequently, the 3 degrees of freedom are partitioned into molecular translational, rotational, and vibrational motion. Three of the degrees of freedom correspond to translational motion of the molecule as a whole (along each of the three spatial dimensions). Similarly, three degrees of freedom correspond to rotations of the molecule about the formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3-axes. Linear molecules only have two rotations because rotations along the bond axis do not change the positions of the atoms in the molecule. The remaining degrees of freedom correspond to molecular vibrational modes. These modes include stretching and bending motions of the chemical bonds of the molecule. For a linear molecule, the number of vibrational modes is 3-5, whereas for a non-linear molecule the number of vibrational modes is 3-6.

====Vibrational energy====

Molecular vibrational energy is known to be quantized and can be modeled using the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) approximation or a Dunham expansion when anharmonicity is important. 
The vibrational energy levels according to the QHO are
:formula_4,
where &quot;n&quot; is a quantum number. Since the selection rules for Raman and infrared absorption generally dictate that only fundamental vibrations are observed, infrared excitation or Stokes Raman excitation results in an energy change of formula_5

The energy range for vibrations is in the range of approximately 5 to 3500 cm−1. The fraction of molecules occupying a given vibrational mode at a given temperature follows a Boltzmann distribution. A molecule can be excited to a higher vibrational mode through the direct absorption of a photon of the appropriate energy, which falls in the terahertz or infrared range. This forms the basis of infrared spectroscopy. Alternatively, the same vibrational excitation can be produced by an inelastic scattering process. This is called Stokes Raman scattering, by analogy with the Stokes shift in fluorescence discovered by George Stokes in 1852, with light emission at longer wavelength (now known to correspond to lower energy) than the absorbed incident light. Conceptually similar effects can be caused by neutrons or electrons rather than light. An increase in photon energy which leaves the molecule in a lower vibrational energy state is called anti-Stokes scattering.

===Raman scattering===
Raman scattering is conceptualized as involving a virtual electronic energy level which corresponds to the energy of the exciting laser photons. Absorption of a photon excites the molecule to the imaginary state and re-emission leads to Raman or Rayleigh scattering. In all three cases the final state has the same electronic energy as the initial state but is higher in vibrational energy in the case of Stokes Raman scattering, lower in the case of anti-Stokes Raman scattering or the same in the case of Rayleigh scattering. Normally this is thought of in terms of wavenumbers, where formula_6 is the wavenumber of the laser and formula_7 is the wavenumber of the vibrational transition. Thus Stokes scattering gives a wavenumber of formula_8 while formula_9 is given for anti-Stokes. When the exciting laser energy corresponds to an actual electronic excitation of the molecule then the resonance Raman effect occurs.

A classical physics based model is able to account for Raman scattering and predicts an increase in the intensity which scales with the fourth-power of the light frequency. Light scattering by a molecule is associated with oscillations of an induced electric dipole. The oscillating electric field component of electromagnetic radiation may bring about an induced dipole in a molecule which follows the alternating electric field which is modulated by the molecular vibrations. Oscillations at the external field frequency are therefore observed along with beat frequencies resulting from the external field and normal mode vibrations.

The spectrum of the scattered photons is termed the Raman spectrum. It shows the intensity of the scattered light as a function of its frequency difference &quot;Δν&quot; to the incident photons, more commonly called a Raman shift. The locations of corresponding Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks form a symmetric pattern around the Rayleigh&quot;Δν=0&quot; line. The frequency shifts are symmetric because they correspond to the energy difference between the same upper and lower resonant states. The intensities of the pairs of features will typically differ, though. They depend on the populations of the initial states of the material, which in turn depend on the temperature. In thermodynamic equilibrium, the lower state will be more populated than the upper state. Therefore, the rate of transitions from the more populated lower state to the upper state (Stokes transitions) will be higher than in the opposite direction (anti-Stokes transitions). Correspondingly, Stokes scattering peaks are stronger than anti-Stokes scattering peaks. Their ratio depends on the temperature, and can therefore be exploited to measure it:
:formula_10

===Selection rules===
In contrast to IR spectroscopy, where there is a requirement for a change in dipole moment for vibrational excitation to take place, Raman scattering requires a change in polarizability. A Raman transition from one state to another is allowed only if the molecular polarizability of those states is different. For a vibration, this means that the derivative of the polarizability with respect to the normal coordinate associated to the vibration is non-zero: formula_11. In general, a normal mode is Raman active if it transforms with the same symmetry of the quadratic forms formula_12, which can be verified from the character table of the molecule&#x27;s point group. As with IR spectroscopy, only fundamental excitations (formula_13) are allowed according to the QHO. There are however many cases where overtones are observed. The rule of mutual exclusion, which states that vibrational modes cannot be both IR and Raman active, applies to certain molecules.

The specific selection rules state that the allowed rotational transitions are formula_14, where formula_15 is the rotational state. This generally is only relevant to molecules in the gas phase where the Raman linewidths are small enough for rotational transitions to be resolved.

A selection rule relevant only to ordered solid materials states that only phonons with zero phase angle can be observed by IR and Raman, except when phonon confinement is manifest.

===Symmetry and polarization===

Monitoring the polarization of the scattered photons is useful for understanding the connections between molecular symmetry and Raman activity which may assist in assigning peaks in Raman spectra. Light polarized in a single direction only gives access to some Raman–active modes, but rotating the polarization gives access to other modes. Each mode is separated according to its symmetry.

The symmetry of a vibrational mode is deduced from the depolarization ratio , which is the ratio of the Raman scattering with polarization orthogonal to the incident laser and the Raman scattering with the same polarization as the incident laser: formula_16 Here formula_17 is the intensity of Raman scattering when the analyzer is rotated 90 degrees with respect to the incident light&#x27;s polarization axis, and formula_18 the intensity of Raman scattering when the analyzer is aligned with the polarization of the incident laser. When polarized light interacts with a molecule, it distorts the molecule which induces an equal and opposite effect in the plane-wave, causing it to be rotated by the difference between the orientation of the molecule and the angle of polarization of the light wave. If formula_19, then the vibrations at that frequency are &quot;depolarized&quot;; meaning they are not totally symmetric.

== Stimulated Raman scattering and Raman amplification ==

The Raman-scattering process as described above takes place spontaneously; i.e., in random time intervals, one of the many incoming photons is scattered by the material. This process is thus called &quot;spontaneous Raman scattering&quot;.

On the other hand, &quot;stimulated Raman scattering&quot; can take place when some Stokes photons have previously been generated by spontaneous Raman scattering (and somehow forced to remain in the material), or when deliberately injecting Stokes photons (&quot;signal light&quot;) together with the original light (&quot;pump light&quot;). In that case, the total Raman-scattering rate is increased beyond that of spontaneous Raman scattering: pump photons are converted more rapidly into additional Stokes photons. The more Stokes photons that are already present, the faster more of them are added. Effectively, this &quot;amplifies&quot; the Stokes light in the presence of the pump light, which is exploited in Raman amplifiers and Raman lasers.

Stimulated Raman scattering is a nonlinear optical effect.

=== Requirement for space-coherence ===
Suppose that the distance between two points A and B of an exciting beam is . Generally, as the exciting frequency is not equal to the scattered Raman frequency, the corresponding relative wavelengths and are not equal. Thus, a phase-shift appears. For , the scattered amplitudes are opposite, so that the Raman scattered beam remains weak.

* A crossing of the beams may limit the path .

Several tricks may be used to get a larger amplitude:

* In an optically anisotropic crystal, a light ray may have two modes of propagation with different polarizations and different indices of refraction. If energy may be transferred between these modes by a quadrupolar (Raman) resonance, phases remain coherent along the whole path, transfer of energy may be large. It is an Optical parametric generation.
* Light may be pulsed, so that beats do not appear. In Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering (ISRS), the length of the pulses must be shorter than all relevant time constants. Interference of Raman and incident lights is too short to allow beats, so that it produces a frequency shift roughly, in best conditions, inversely proportional to the cube of the pulse length. 
In labs, femtosecond laser pulses must be used because the ISRS becomes very weak if the pulses are too long. Thus ISRS cannot be observed using nanosecond pulses making ordinary time-incoherent light.

==Inverse Raman effect==
The inverse Raman effect is a form of Raman scattering first noted by W. J. Jones and Boris P. Stoicheff. In some circumstances, Stokes scattering can exceed anti-Stokes scattering; in these cases the continuum (on leaving the material) is observed to have an absorption line (a dip in intensity) at ν&quot;L&quot;+ν&quot;M&quot;. This phenomenon is referred to as the &quot;inverse Raman effect&quot;; the application of the phenomenon is referred to as &quot;inverse Raman spectroscopy&quot;, and a record of the continuum is referred to as an &quot;inverse Raman spectrum&quot;.

In the original description of the inverse Raman effect, the authors discuss both absorption from a continuum of higher frequencies and absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies. They note that absorption from a continuum of lower frequencies will not be observed if the Raman frequency of the material is vibrational in origin and if the material is in thermal equilibrium.

=== Supercontinuum generation ===
For high-intensity continuous wave (CW) lasers, stimulated Raman scattering can be used to produce a broad bandwidth supercontinuum. This process can also be seen as a special case of four-wave mixing, in which the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the phonon energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with spontaneous emission and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving fiber laser field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.

==Applications==

Raman spectroscopy employs the Raman effect for substances analysis. The spectrum of the Raman-scattered light depends on the molecular constituents present and their state, allowing the spectrum to be used for material identification and analysis. Raman spectroscopy is used to analyze a wide range of materials, including gases, liquids, and solids. Highly complex materials such as biological organisms and human tissue can also be analyzed by Raman spectroscopy.

For solid materials, Raman scattering is used as a tool to detect high-frequency phonon and magnon excitations.

Raman lidar is used in atmospheric physics to measure the atmospheric extinction coefficient and the water vapour vertical distribution.

Stimulated Raman transitions are also widely used for manipulating a trapped ion&#x27;s energy levels, and thus basis qubit states.

Raman spectroscopy can be used to determine the force constant and bond length for molecules that do not have an infrared absorption spectrum.

Raman amplification is used in optical amplifiers.

The Raman effect is also involved in producing the appearance of the blue sky (see Rayleigh Scattering: &#x27;Rayleigh scattering of molecular nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere includes elastic scattering as well as the inelastic contribution from rotational Raman scattering in air&#x27;).

Raman spectroscopy has been used to chemically image small molecules, such as nucleic acids, in biological systems by a vibrational tag.

<doc id="623875" wikidata="Q541195" url="?curid=623875" title="Anglo-Japanese Alliance">
<text>The was an alliance between the United Kingdom and the Empire of Japan which was effective from 1902 to 1923. The treaty creating the alliance was signed at Lansdowne House in London on 30 January 1902 by British foreign secretary Lord Lansdowne and Japanese diplomat Hayashi Tadasu. After the preceding era of unequal treaties enforced on Asian countries including Japan, the alliance was a military pact concluded on more equal terms between a Western power and non-Western nation. It reflected the success of Meiji-era reforms that modernized and industrialized Japan&#x27;s economy, society and military, which enabled Japan to extract itself from the inferior position it had previously shared with other Asian countries like China, which had been subordinated to Western empires either through formal colonial acquisition or unequal treaties. 

One shared motivation for the agreement was that a diplomatic alliance might deter other world powers that might otherwise encroach on British and Japanese imperial interests in Asia. For the British, the alliance marked the end of a period of &quot;splendid isolation&quot; while allowing for greater focus on protecting its rule over India and competing in the Anglo-German naval arms race, as part of a larger strategy to reduce imperial overcommitment and recall the Royal Navy to defend Britain. By contrast, it came at a time of Japan&#x27;s ascendancy; Japan had not only successfully abrogated the unequal treaties it was previously subject to by the Western powers, but was now a fledging empire in its own right: Japan had imposed its own unequal treaty on Korea in 1876 and now controlled Formosa (Taiwan) as a colony, as Taiwan been ceded by Qing China to Japan in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, after the First Sino-Japanese War. Consequently, Japan was now developing its own imperial sphere of influence, and felt that a conflict with Russia was imminent over rival ambitions in Manchuria and Korea, especially after the Triple Intervention in 1895, in which Russia, France, and Germany coerced Japan into relinquishing its claim on the Liaodong Peninsula. Article 3 of the alliance promised support if either signatory became involved in war with more than one power, and thus had the effect of deterring France from assisting its ally Russia in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Instead, France concluded the Entente Cordiale with Britain and limited its support of Russia to providing loans. Japan also gained international prestige from the alliance and used it as a foundation for their diplomacy for two decades, although the alliance angered the United States and some British dominions, whose opinion of Japan worsened and gradually became hostile.

After Japan&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese war and the resulting treaty that granted the Japanese control over Korea, the alliance was renewed in 1905 and 1911. In 1914, it enabled Japan&#x27;s entry into World War I and capture of German-held territories in Asia. Britain grew increasingly distrustful of Japan over its ambitions over Asia, and the alliance was ended with the signing of the Four-Power Treaty in 1921 and terminated upon its ratification in 1923.

==Motivations and reservations==


The possibility of an alliance between Great Britain and Japan had been canvassed since 1895, when Britain refused to join the Triple Intervention of France, Germany and Russia against the Japanese occupation of the Liaodong Peninsula. While this single event was an unstable basis for an alliance, the case was strengthened by the support Britain had given Japan in its drive towards modernisation and their co-operative efforts to put down the Boxer Rebellion. Newspapers of both countries voiced support for such an alliance; in Britain, Francis Brinkley of &quot;The Times&quot; and Edwin Arnold of the &quot;Telegraph&quot; were the driving force behind such support, while in Japan the pro-alliance mood of politician Ōkuma Shigenobu stirred the &quot;Mainichi&quot; and &quot;Yomiuri&quot; newspapers into pro-alliance advocacy. The 1894 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation had also paved the way for equal relations and the possibility of an alliance.

In the end, the common interest truly fuelling the alliance was opposition to Russian expansion, such as the invasion of Manchuria continuing after the Boxer Rebellion. This was made clear as early as the 1890s, when the British diplomat Cecil Spring Rice identified that Britain and Japan working in concert was the only way to challenge Russian power in the region. Negotiations began when Russia began to move into China. Nevertheless, both countries had their reservations. Britain was cautious about abandoning its policy of &quot;splendid isolation&quot;, wary of antagonizing Russia, and unwilling to act on the treaty if Japan were to attack the United States. There were factions in the Japanese government that still hoped for a compromise with Russia, including the highly powerful political figure Hirobumi Itō, who had served four terms as Prime Minister of Japan. It was thought that friendship within Asia would be more amenable to the US, which was uncomfortable with the rise of Japan as a power. Furthermore, Britain was unwilling to protect Japanese interests in Korea and likewise, the Japanese were unwilling to support Britain in India.

Hayashi and Lord Lansdowne began their discussions in July 1901, and disputes over Korea and India delayed them until November. At this point, Hirobumi Itō requested a delay in negotiations in order to attempt a reconciliation with Russia. He was mostly unsuccessful in his visit to Saint Petersburg, and Britain expressed concerns over duplicity on Japan&#x27;s part, so Hayashi hurriedly re-entered negotiations in 1902. &quot;Splendid isolation&quot; was ended as for the first time Britain saw the need for a peace-time military alliance. It was the first alliance on equal terms between East and West. For Britain, the revision of &quot;Splendid isolation&quot; spurred by the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, culminated in the Entente Cordiale (1904) with France and Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907.

==Terms of the 1902 treaty==
The treaty contained six articles:

Article 1
*The High Contracting parties, having mutually recognised the independence of China and Korea, declare themselves to be entirely uninfluenced by aggressive tendencies in either country, having in view, however, their special interests, of which those of Great Britain relate principally to China, whilst Japan, in addition to the interests which she possesses in China, is interested in a peculiar degree, politically as well as commercially and industrially in Korea, the High Contracting Parties recognise that it will be admissible for either of them to take such measures as may be indispensable in order to safeguard those interests if threatened either by the aggressive action of any other Power, or by disturbances arising in China or Korea, and necessitating the intervention of either of the High Contracting Parties for the protection of the lives and properties of its subjects.

Article 2
*Declaration of neutrality if either signatory becomes involved in war through Article 1.

Article 3
*Promise of support if either signatory becomes involved in war with more than one Power.

Article 4
*Signatories promise not to enter into separate agreements with other Powers to the prejudice of this alliance.

Article 5
*The signatories promise to communicate frankly and fully with each other when any of the interests affected by this treaty are in jeopardy.

Article 6
*Treaty to remain in force for five years and then at one years&#x27; notice, unless notice was given at the end of the fourth year.

Articles 2 and 3 were most crucial concerning war and mutual defense.

The treaty laid out an acknowledgment of Japanese interests in Korea without obligating Britain to help if a conflict arose where Japan only had one adversary. Japan was likewise not obligated to defend British interests unless there were two adversaries.

Although written using careful and clear language, the two sides understood the Treaty slightly differently. Britain saw it as a gentle warning to Russia, while Japan was emboldened by it. From that point on, even those of a moderate stance refused to accept a compromise over the issue of Korea. Extremists saw it as an open invitation for imperial expansion, many in Japan having long desired a showdown with Russia. The provision on the involvement of more than one power (article 3) recalled the Triple Intervention by the Russian-French-German coalition in 1895, and strengthened Japan&#x27;s hand both diplomatically and militarily against a potential European coalition.

This treaty was signed by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Marquess Henry Lansdowne, and Count Hayashi Tadasu on 30 January, effective 31 January 1902 for five years.

==Intelligence Agreements==

In May 1902, Major General Fukushima Yasumasa, who was a senior intelligence officer of the Army General Staff and the initial commander of the Japanese Army sent to China to stop the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, was sent to London to wrap up informal discussions on military intelligence cooperation. Director General of Mobilisation and Military Intelligence, Sir William Nicholson headed the British side of the negotiation, and various intelligence cooperation agreements were signed between the two in July. Fukushima represented Emperor Meiji at the coronation of King Edward VII on 9 August and stayed until September 1902 to work on the details. The existence and contents of the agreements were not made public.

== 1905 Revision ==
The alliance was renewed and expanded in 1905. This was partly prompted by Japan&#x27;s gains in the Russo-Japanese War, and by the British suspicion about Russian intentions in South Asia, leading to Britain considering asking Japan to help defend India. This August 1905 revision additionally called for Japanese support of British interests in India (if Britain faced more than one adversary as stipulated in the original).

This revision was signed by Lords Lansdowne and Hayashi on 12 August 1905, effective 13 August for 10 years.

Within four months after the signing of this revision, Korea became a Japanese protectorate, and Itō Hirobumi was posted as the Resident-General to Seoul in February 1906.

== 1911 Revision ==
Although the &quot;second&quot; alliance in 1905 was effective for a decade, the alliance was revised earlier in 1911.

As a background, William McKinley won the 1896 U.S. presidential election, succeeding Grover Cleveland, who was a friend of Queen Liliʻuokalani of Hawaii. This Republican victory led to British-American rapprochement, and the annexation of Republic of Hawaiʻi by the US, giving impetus to expansionists in the US. As a result of 1898 Spanish–American War, the Mariana Islands (including Guam) became under the United States control in December 1898. The Empire of Japan fought and lost against the US in 1899–1902, supporting the Philippines in Philippine–American War, which resulted in establishing control of the Philippine Islands by the US. The expansionistic policy of the Republican US administration was carried over to Theodore Roosevelt in 1901.&lt;br&gt;
Great power politics substantially changed following the Anglo-Russian entente of 1907, which settled the Russo-British Great Game; continued Japanese negotiations in the wake of the Russo-Japanese War, including a 1907 partitioning of Manchuria with Russia; and the UK&#x27;s growing rivalry with the German Empire.

With the increasing Japanese and the US influence not only in the Pacific but also in global politics in this context, Britain negotiated a &quot;third&quot; Anglo-Japanese alliance to carefully remove the United States from the possible &#x27;adversary&#x27; in the agreement (ARTICLE 4), and Japan agreed in return for restoring Japan&#x27;s tariff autonomy. Komura Jutarō and later Prime Minister Katō Takaaki were major negotiators during this 1911 revision.

This revision was signed by Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Edward Grey and Japanese Ambassador to London, Count Katō Takaaki on 13 July, effective 14 July 1911, with a 10 year term until July 1921.
==Effects==

=== Forming alliance and rivalries ===

The first version of the alliance was announced on 12 February 1902. In response, Russia sought to form alliances with France and Germany, which Germany declined. The French also were reluctant to become more deeply involved with Russia in east Asia. On 16 March 1902, a joint Franco-Russian declaration was issued responding to the alliance, reserving their right to intervene in and around China to defend their interests. The British and later historians found this declaration to be &quot;anodyne&quot;, signaling that France was reconsidering its military obligations towards Russia. China and the United States were strongly opposed to the alliance.

=== Unofficial role in Russo-Japanese War ===
The Russo-Japanese War broke out in 1904, as Japan sought to halt the expansion of the Russian Empire&#x27;s colonies in China. Britain did not officially join the Russo-Japanese War, but supported Japan in espionage, ship design, finance, and diplomacy during the war.

Meanwhile, even before the war, British and Japanese intelligence had co-operated against Russia due to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. During the war, Indian Army stations in Malaya and China often intercepted and read wireless and telegraph cable traffic relating to the war, which was shared with the Japanese. In their turn, the Japanese shared information about Russia with the British with one British official writing of the &quot;perfect quality&quot; of Japanese intelligence. In particular, British and Japanese intelligence gathered much evidence that Germany was supporting Russia in the war as part of a bid to disturb the balance of power in Europe, which led to British officials increasingly perceiving that country as a threat to the international order.

=== World War I ===

The alliance&#x27;s provisions for mutual defence required Japan to enter the First World War on the British side. The Treaty made possible the Japanese seizure of German possessions in the Pacific north of the equator during the War. Japan attacked the German base at Qingdao in 1914 and forced the Germans to surrender (see Siege of Tsingtao). Japanese officers onboard British warships were casualties at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, and on HMS Vanguard in 1917. In 1917, Japanese warships were sent to the Mediterranean and assisted in the protection of Allied shipping near Malta from U-boat attacks. A memorial at the Kalkara Naval Cemetery in Malta is dedicated to the 72 Japanese sailors who died in the conflict, including the 1917 torpedoing of the Japanese destroyer &quot;Sakaki&quot;.

=== Cultural exchanges ===
The alliance formed the basis for positive trading and cultural exchanges between Britain and Japan. Japanese agencies published numerous English-language releases and publications. Rapid industrialisation and the development of the Japanese armed forces provided significant new export opportunities for British shipyards and arms manufacturers. Japanese educated in Britain brought new knowledge in science, engineering, and medicine to Japan, such as advances in fluid- and thermo-dynamics, and ophthalmology. British artists of the time such as James McNeill Whistler, Aubrey Beardsley and Charles Rennie Mackintosh were heavily inspired by Japanese kimono, swords, crafts and architecture.

Unique cultural exchanges included that the author Yoshimoto Tadasu (b. 1878, d. 1973), who wrote &quot;True Britain&quot; (Shin no Eikoku) in 1902, was the first blind person in Japan to receive higher education, and brought some British ideas on public welfare to Japan. The clergyman Kumagai Tetsutaro (b. 1883, d. 1979) praised the book as having a major impact on opportunities for people with blindness.

The Japan–British Exhibition in 1910 in White City, London had eight million visitors. It sought to promote knowledge of Japan&#x27;s modernization and the idea of an &#x27;alliance of peoples&#x27; between Britain and Japan. It featured Japanese fine arts, musicians, Sumo demonstrations, and influenced by Edwardian expectations, it featured exhibitions of Ainu, Taiwanese and Japanese &#x27;villages&#x27;. The organizers portrayed a cultural-historical parallel between Britain and Japan as symmetrical &quot;Island Empires&quot; in East and West. Organized by the Japanese government, it was one of the largest such expositions at its time.

==Limitations==
Despite the purportedly friendly relations between Britain and Japan during the early 20th century, the relationship started to strain over various issues. One such strain was the issue of the &quot;racial equality clause&quot; as proposed by the Japanese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference. The clause, which was to be attached to the Covenant of the League of Nations, was compatible with the British stance of equality for all subjects as a principle for maintaining imperial unity; however, there were significant deviations in the stated interests of Britain&#x27;s dominions, notably Australia, and the British delegation ultimately acceded to imperial opposition and declined to support the clause.

Another strain was the Twenty-One Demands issued by Japan to the Republic of China in 1915. The demands would have drastically increased Japanese influence in China and transformed the Chinese state into a &quot;de facto&quot; protectorate of Japan. Feeling desperate, the Chinese government appealed to Britain and the U.S., which forced Japan to moderate the demands issued; ultimately, the Japanese government gained little influence in China, but lost prestige amongst the Western nations (including Britain, which was affronted and no longer trusted the Japanese as a reliable ally).

Even though Britain was the wealthiest industrialized power, and Japan was a newly industrialized power with a large export market, which would seem to create natural economic ties, those ties were somewhat limited, which provided a major limitation of the alliance. British banks saw Japan as a risky investment due to what they saw as restrictive property laws and an unstable financial situation, and offered loans to Japan with high interest rates, similar to those they offered the Ottoman Empire, Chile, China, and Egypt, which was disappointing to Japan. The banker and later Prime Minister Takahashi Korekiyo argued that Britain was implying, through unattractive loan terms, that Japan had reverted from one of the &quot;civilized nations&quot; to &quot;undeveloped nations&quot;, referring that Japan had more easily received foreign capital to fund its First Sino-Japanese War than the Russo-Japanese War. Nathaniel Rothschild was initially skeptical of Japan&#x27;s economy; however, he would later describe Osaka as the &quot;Manchester of Japan&quot; and Japan as &quot;one of the countries of the future.&quot; Henry Dyer wrote after 1906 that Japanese bonds &quot;has aroused keen interest among British investors, who have always been partial to Japanese bonds.&quot; Dyer, a recipient of the Order of the Rising Sun from Emperor Meiji, had played a role in the expansion of industrialization and engineering in Japan as part of a significant foreign investment. Dyer criticized what he saw as widespread British skepticism of Japan&#x27;s economy. Meanwhile, influential industrialists in Japan such as businessman Iwasaki Yanosuke were at times skeptical of foreign investment, which led the Japanese government to channel it through some controlled enterprises acting as intermediaries with the private sector in London and Tokyo, which was seen as excess regulation by some British industrialists. Nevertheless, Britain did lend capital to Japan during the Russo-Japanese War, while Japan provided major loans to the Entente during World War I.

==End of the treaty==

The alliance was viewed as an obstacle already at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919–1920. On 8 July 1920, the two governments issued a joint statement to the effect that the alliance treaty &quot;is not entirely consistent with the letter of that Covenant (of the League of Nations), which both Governments earnestly desire to respect&quot;.

The demise of the alliance was signaled by the 1921 Imperial Conference, in which British and Dominion leaders convened to determine a unified international policy. One of the major issues of the conference was the renewal of the Anglo–Japanese Alliance. The conference began with all but Canadian Prime Minister Arthur Meighen supporting the immediate renewal of an alliance with Japan. The prevailing hope was for a continuance of the alliance with the Pacific power, which could potentially provide security for British imperial interests in the area. The Australians feared that they could not fend off any advances from the Imperial Japanese Navy, and desired a continuance of the buildup of naval resources for a possible future conflict as they feared that an alliance with the United States (then in a state of post-war isolationism) would provide little protection.

Meighen, fearing that a conflict could develop between Japan and the United States, demanded the British Empire remove itself from the treaty to avoid being forced into a war between the two nations. The rest of the delegates agreed that it was best to court America and try to find a solution that the American government would find suitable, but only Meighen called for the complete abrogation of the treaty. The American government feared that the renewal of the Anglo–Japanese Alliance would create a Japanese-dominated market in the Pacific, and close China off from American trade. These fears were elevated by the news media in America and Canada, which reported alleged secret anti-American clauses in the treaty, and advised the public to support abrogation.

The press, combined with Meighen&#x27;s convincing argument of Canadian fears that Japan would attack imperial assets in China, caused the Imperial Conference to shelve the alliance. The conference communicated their desire to consider leaving the alliance to the League of Nations, which stated that the alliance would continue, as originally stated with the leaving party giving the other a twelve-month notice of their intentions.

Empire delegates convinced America to invite several nations to Washington to participate in talks regarding Pacific and Far East policies, specifically naval disarmament. When Japan came to the Washington Naval Conference, there was significant distrust of Britain in the press and public opinion, even amongst Japanese papers that had previously been more supportive of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. 

Despite the growing rift, Japan joined the conference in hopes of avoiding a war with the United States. The Pacific powers of the United States, Japan, France and Britain would sign the Four-Power Treaty, and adding on various other countries such as China to create the Nine-Power Treaty. The Four-Power Treaty would provide a minimal structure for the expectations of international relations in the Pacific, as well as a loose alliance without any commitment to armed alliances. The Four-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference made the Anglo–Japanese Alliance defunct in December, 1921; however, it would not officially terminate until all parties ratified the treaty on 17 August 1923, as Britain did not notify Japan, nor did Japan notify the UK, of the termination after the July 1921 end of term, as required by ARTICLE 6 of the 1911 revision.
At that time, the Alliance was officially terminated, as per Article IV in the Anglo–Japanese Alliance Treaties of 1902 and 1911. The distrust between the British Empire and Japan, as well as the manner in which the Anglo–Japanese Alliance concluded, have been suggested by some as being the leading causes of Japan&#x27;s involvement in World War II, and that had the alliance not been terminated, Anglo-Japanese ties would not have deteriorated to that degree. 

However, more recent scholarship has argued that such an interpretation amounts to historical myth-making, because it neglects how the political rivalry resulting from Japan and Britain&#x27;s increasingly overlapping spheres of imperial influence had already substantially strained the alliance&#x27;s political rationale for years before its termination. One key line of evidence is that Japan-British imperial interests had substantially conflicted before 1921 because Japan was already perceived to be undermining European colonial rule over Asia. Britain had specifically become increasingly suspicious of a potential Japanese threat to its Asian colonies and interests due to growing Japanese ambitions in China, the rise in Pan-Asianism, as demonstrated by the support shown by Japanese state and non-state actors for Indian revolutionaries, and the presence of Japanese propagandists in Malaya and India. Therefore, the end of the Alliance would instead be symptomatic of the already-present political reality of eroding ties between both countries, rather than its cause. 

Such tensions were also evident in then-contemporary British political figures, such as Lord Curzon, who stated in 1920 that the main reason for the alliance with the &quot;insidious and unscrupulous&quot; Japanese was to keep them in order, rather than rooted in a friendly relations and diplomatic trust. These views were also reflected in British papers such as &quot;The Times,&quot; which even questioned Japanese contributions to the Allied side, and expressed suspicion towards Japan and sympathy with China in the aftermath of the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. 

According to Zoltan Buzas, racially shaped threat perceptions led the British and the Americans to push for the termination of the alliance.

<doc id="623885" wikidata="Q542806" url="?curid=623885" title="Aristarchus (crater)">
<text>Aristarchus is a lunar impact crater that lies in the northwest part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is considered the brightest of the large formations on the lunar surface, with an albedo nearly double that of most lunar features. The feature is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye, and displays unusually bright features when viewed through a large telescope. It is also readily identified when most of the lunar surface is illuminated by earthshine. The crater is deeper than the Grand Canyon.

The crater is named after the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos. It is located at the southeastern edge of the Aristarchus plateau, an elevated area that contains a number of volcanic features, such as sinuous rilles. This area is also noted for the large number of reported transient lunar phenomena, as well as recent emissions of radon gas as measured by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft.

== Selenography ==
Aristarchus is located on the Aristarchus plateau, an elevated rocky rise in the midst of the Oceanus Procellarum, a large expanse of lunar mare. This is a tilted crustal block, about 200 km across, that rises to a maximum elevation of 2 km above the mare in the southeastern section. Aristarchus is just to the east of the crater Herodotus and the Vallis Schröteri, and south of a system of narrow sinuous rilles named Rimae Aristarchus.

Aristarchus is bright because it is a relatively young formation, approximately 450 million years old, and the solar wind has not yet had time to darken the excavated material by the process of space weathering. The impact occurred following the creation of the ray crater Copernicus, but before the appearance of Tycho. Due to its prominent rays, Aristarchus is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

The brightest feature of this crater is the steep central peak. Sections of the interior floor appear relatively level, but Lunar Orbiter photographs reveal the surface is covered in many small hills, streaky gouges, and some minor fractures. The crater has a terraced outer wall, roughly polygonal in shape, and covered in a bright blanket of ejecta. These spread out into bright rays to the south and south-east, suggesting that Aristarchus was most likely formed by an oblique impact from the northeast, and their composition includes material from both the Aristarchus plateau and the lunar mare.

In November 2011, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter passed over the crater, which spans almost 25 miles (40 kilometers) and sinks more than 2 miles (3.5 kilometers) deep. &quot;The Aristarchus plateau is one of the most geologically diverse places on the moon: a mysterious raised flat plateau, a giant rille carved by enormous outpourings of lava, fields of explosive volcanic ash, and all surrounded by massive flood basalts,&quot; said Mark Robinson, principal investigator of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera at Arizona State University. NASA released photos of the crater on December 25, 2011.
==Remote sensing==
In 1911, Professor Robert W. Wood used ultraviolet photography to take images of the crater area. He discovered the plateau had an anomalous appearance in the ultraviolet, and an area to the north appeared to give indications of a sulfur deposit. This colorful area is sometimes referred to as &quot;Wood&#x27;s Spot&quot;, an alternative name for the Aristarchus plateau.
Spectra taken of this crater during the Clementine mission were used to perform mineral mapping. The data indicated that the central peak is a type of rock called anorthosite, which is a slow-cooling form of igneous rock composed of plagioclase feldspar. By contrast the outer wall is troctolite, a rock composed of equal parts plagioclase and olivine.

The Aristarchus region was part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was investigating the presence of oxygen-rich glassy soils in the form of the mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.

==Transient lunar phenomena==
The region of the Aristarchus plateau has been the site of many reported transient lunar phenomena, with a total of 122 such reports by 2007; the highest recorded for any lunar feature. Such events include temporary obscurations and colorations of the surface, and catalogues of these show that more than one-third of the most reliable spottings come from this locale. In 1971 when Apollo 15 passed 110 kilometers above the Aristarchus plateau, a significant rise in alpha particles was detected. These particles are believed to be caused by the decay of radon-222, a radioactive gas with a half-life of only 3.8 days. The Lunar Prospector mission later confirmed radon-222 emissions from this crater. These observations could be explained by either the slow and visually imperceptible diffusion of gas to the surface, or by discrete explosive events.

One of the oldest reports of transient lunar phenomena in Aristarchus is an observation made by Heinrich Wilhelm Matthias Olbers on 5 February 1821. Contemporary Henry Kater publicly believed that this and other events were due to volcanic activity on the Moon, a belief not so confidently shared by Olbers, who believed it explainable in a manner &quot;more consistent with what we know of the physical construction of the moon.&quot;

==Names==
Aristarchus is named after the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system became standardized in 1935. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Balthasaris Hispa. Pri.&quot; after Balthazar Charles, then the heir apparent to the kingdoms of Spain. And Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Mons Porphyrites&quot; after the mountains near Olbia, Egypt. A particular region of very low ultraviolet albedo is called Wood&#x27;s Spot after its discoverer, Robert W. Wood.

== Satellite craters ==
Surrounding Aristarchus are several smaller craters, many of which are probably secondary craters. Secondary craters form when large blocks ejected from the primary crater reimpact the surface at high velocities. By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing a letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to the primary crater.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.

* Aristarchus A — &quot;See&quot; Väisälä.
* Aristarchus C — &quot;See&quot; Toscanelli.

<doc id="623890" wikidata="Q33484" url="?curid=623890" title="Fang language">
<text>Fang () is a Central African language spoken by around one million people, most of them in Equatorial Guinea, and northern Gabon, where it is the dominant Bantu language; Fang is also spoken in southern Cameroon, the Republic of the Congo, and small fractions of the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe. It is related to the Bulu and Ewondo languages of southern Cameroon.

Under President Macías Nguema, Fang was the official language of Equatorial Guinea, although in 1982, the Third Constitution once again replaced it with Spanish. Since then, each version of the Constitution has recognized Fang and other languages indigenous to the country as integral to the national culture, despite these languages not having official status.

There are many different variants of Fang in northern Gabon and southern Cameroon. Maho (2009) lists Southwest Fang as a distinct language. The other dialects are Ntoumou, Okak, Mekê, Atsi (Batsi), Nzaman (Zaman), Mveni, and Mvaïe.

==Distribution==
According to ALCAM (2012), Fang is mainly spoken in northern Gabon and also in Equatorial Guinea. Dialects include Ntumu, Mvayn, and Okak. In Cameroon, Fang is spoken in the southern half of Dja-et-Lobo department (Southern Region) south of Djoum. It is also spoken in the southeast of Mvila department: south of Mvangan, plus small isolated parts of Océan department between Lolodorf and Kribi where the Okak dialect is spoken. The other dialects, Mvayn and Ntumu, are spoken in Vallée-du-Ntem department.

==Corpus and lexicology==

Despite Fang&#x27;s lack of any well-defined literary corpus, it is of note that linguists have, in the past, made attempts to compile dictionaries and lexicons for the Fang language. The two most notable ones to be proposed or fully compiled were made by Maillard (2007) and Bibang (2014). Neither created a direct Fang-English dictionary, but opted instead to separate the two languages via third European languages (French and Spanish, respectively) as a bridge for various loanwords.

The translation efforts to English have been done through Romance languages: specifically, Spanish and French. The latter of the two languages would likely have had the most impact on the language, given the occupation of Gabon by the French during the existence of French Equatorial Africa (itself part of French West Africa), which lasted 75 years from 1885 to 1960. To a lesser extent, in São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese also likely has influenced the dialects of Fang present there, due to the country being occupied by Portugal for most of the islands&#x27; history of habitation.

==Phonology==
The phonology of Fang is listed below.

===Consonants===
In Fang, there are 24 plain consonants. The majority of them can become prenasalized:

 is only used in interjections and loanwords.
Words can not start with , except when followed by a velar consonant. and also are restricted from word-initial position. and can only come in word-initial position in words of foreign origin, although in many of these cases, becomes realized as .

The morpheme &quot;gh&quot; is pronounced as in the case of the word &quot;Beyoghe&quot; (the Fang term for Libreville); one of several changes to pronunciation by morphology.

It is also important to note that in Fang, at every &quot;hiatus&quot; (shock of two vowels), such as in &quot;Ma adzi&quot;, it is required for one to make the second word an aphetism, dropping the pronunciation of the sound at the start of the second word (e.g. &quot;Ma dzi&quot;).

===Vowels===

Fang has seven vowels, each of which can have short or long realizations.

Nasal vowels are allophones of the respective oral vowels, when followed by a nasal consonant or . Words cannot start with , , or .

====Diphthongs====
Diphthongs can be a combination of any vowel with or , as well as , , , .

===Tone===

Fang distinguishes between at least five lexical tones, conventionally called: high, mid, low, rising and falling. One vowel in a sequences of vowels can be elided in casual speech, though its tone remains and attaches to the remaining vowel.

<doc id="623891" wikidata="Q882097" url="?curid=623891" title="Blastomere">
<text>In biology, a blastomere is a type of cell produced by cell division (cleavage) of the zygote after fertilization; blastomeres are an essential part of blastula formation, and blastocyst formation in mammals.

==Human blastomere characteristics==

In humans, blastomere formation begins immediately following fertilization and continues through the first week of embryonic development. About 90 minutes after fertilization, the zygote divides into two cells. The two-cell blastomere state, present after the zygote first divides, is considered the earliest mitotic product of the fertilized oocyte. These mitotic divisions continue and result in a grouping of cells called blastomeres. During this process, the total size of the embryo does not increase, so each division results in smaller and smaller cells. When the zygote contains 16 to 32 blastomeres it is referred to as a morula. These are the preliminary stages in the embryo beginning to form. Once this begins, microtubules within the morula&#x27;s cytosolic material in the blastomere cells can develop into important membrane functions, such as sodium pumps. These pumps allow the inside of the embryo to fill with blastocoelic fluid, which supports the further growth of life.

The blastomere is considered totipotent; that is, blastomeres are capable of developing from a single cell into a fully fertile adult organism. This has been demonstrated through studies and conjectures made with mouse blastomeres, which have been accepted as true for most mammalian blastomeres as well. Studies have analyzed monozygotic twin mouse blastomeres in their two-cell state, and have found that when one of the twin blastomeres is destroyed, a fully fertile adult mouse can still develop. Thus, it can be assumed that since one of the twin cells was totipotent, the destroyed one originally was as well.

Relative blastomere size within the embryo is dependent not only on the stage of the cleavage, but also on the regularity of the cleavage amongst the cells. If the number of blastomeres in the cellular mass is even, then the sizes of the cells should be congruent. However, if the number of blastomeres in the cellular mass is not even, then the division should be asynchronous such that the sizes of the cells best support the mass&#x27;s specific stage of differentiation. Blastomere size is typically considered uneven when one blastomere has a diameter over 25% larger than that of the other being compared.

== Blastomere differentiation ==
The division of blastomeres from the zygote allows a single fertile cell to continue to cleave and differentiate until a blastocyst forms. The differentiation of the blastomere allows for the development of two distinct cell populations: the inner cell mass, which becomes the precursor to the embryo, and the trophectoderm, which becomes the precursor to the placenta. These precursors typically appear when the blastomere differentiates into the 8- and 16-cell masses.

During the 8-cell differentiation period, the blastomeres form adheren junctions, and subsequently polarize along the apical-basal axis. This polarization permanently changes the morphology of these cells, and starts the differentiation process. After this, the 8-cell blastomere mass begins to compact by forming tight junctions between themselves, and cytosolic components of the cell accumulate in the apical region while the nucleus of each cell moves to the basal region. The adhesive lateral junction is then formed, and the blastomere is flattened to establish the apical cortical domain. Once the transition begins to a 16-cell mass, the apical cortical domain disappears, but elements of polarity are preserved. This allows for approximately half of the blastomeres to inherit polar regions that can rebuild the apical cortical domain. The other blastomeres that differentiate, then, will become apolar. Polar blastomere cells that differentiate will move to an outer position in the developing blastocyst and show precursors for the trophectoderm, while the apolar cells will move to an inner position and begin developing into the embryo. The cells will then fully commit to their individual states in one of these two domains at the 32-cell stage.

=== Models of differentiation ===
There are two main models for differentiation that determine which blastomere cells will divide into either the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. The first conjecture is known as the &quot;inside-outside model&quot;, and states that the cells differentiate based on their state in the 16-cell stage or later. This means that, under this model, blastomere cells do not differentiate based on cellular differences, but rather they do so because of mechanical and chemical stimuli based on where they are positioned at that time.

The other, more widely accepted model is known as the &quot;cell-polarity model&quot;. This model states that the orientation of the cleavage plane at the 8-cell and 16-cell stages determines their later differentiation. There are two main ways in which blastomeres typically divide: symmetrically, meaning perpendicular to the apical-basal axis, or asymmetrically, meaning horizontal to the apical-basal axis. Many potential hypotheses and conjectures that attempt to explain why these cells orient themselves the way that they do. Some researchers have stated that early-dividing blastomeres tend to divide asymmetrically, while others have proposed that the orientation of 8-cell stage blastomeres is random and cannot be predicted on a larger scale. One study in particular states that the position of the nucleus in each blastomere can be used to indicate how the cell will divide: if the nucleus is in the apical region then the cell will likely divide symmetrically, while if the nucleus is located in the basal region then the cell will likely divide asymmetrically.

==Related disorders==

It is possible for errors to occur during this process of repetitive cell division. Common among these errors is for the genetic material to not be divided evenly. Normally, when a cell divides each daughter cell has the same genetic material as the parent cell; if the genetic material does not split evenly between the two daughter cells, an event called &quot;nondisjunction&quot; occurs. Since this event occurs in only one of the several cells that exist at this point, the embryo will continue to develop but will have some normal cells and some abnormal cells. This disorder is called &quot;numerical mosaicism&quot;.

This mosaicism, especially of diploidy and polyploidy, can lead to the failure of cell cleavage and mitosis. When these necessary early cell divisions do not occur, the embryo can begin to form polyploid giant cancer cells that function very similarly to blastomere cells in order to grow and evolve in response to mechanical and chemical signals just like blastocyst precursors do. Studies have shown that these giant cancer cells are often also the genetic equivalent to somatic blastomeres.

=== Diagnostics ===
Oftentimes, clinicians and researchers will use blastomere biopsies in at-risk pregnant women as a way to test for genetic disorders. These biopsies are invasive, however, and have a major disadvantage when compared to other forms of invasive genetic testing in that only a few number of cells can be extracted at a time. Over time many specialists have switched to blastocyst biopsies, which provide a lower level of mosaicism, but blastomere biopsies can still be used for earlier-stage studies and genetic diagnostics.

<doc id="623895" wikidata="Q2991489" url="?curid=623895" title="County palatine">
<text>In England, Wales and Ireland a county palatine or palatinate was an area ruled by a hereditary nobleman enjoying special authority and autonomy from the rest of a kingdom. The name derives from the Latin adjective &quot;palātīnus&quot;, &quot;relating to the palace&quot;, from the noun &quot;palātium&quot;, &quot;palace&quot;. It thus implies the exercise of a &quot;quasi&quot;-royal prerogative within a county, that is to say, a jurisdiction ruled by an earl, the English equivalent of a count. A duchy palatine is similar but is ruled over by a duke, a nobleman of higher precedence than an earl or count.

The nobleman swore allegiance to the monarch yet had the power to rule the county largely independently of the king. It should therefore be distinguished from the feudal barony, held from the king, which possessed no such independent authority. Rulers of counties palatine created their own feudal baronies, to be held directly from them &quot;in capite&quot;, such as the Barony of Halton. County palatine jurisdictions were created in England under the rule of the Norman dynasty, while in continental Europe they have an earlier date.

In general, when a palatine-type autonomy was granted to a lord by the sovereign, it was in a district on the periphery of the kingdom, at a time when the district was at risk from disloyal armed insurgents who could retreat beyond the borders and re-enter. For the English sovereign in Norman times, this applied to northern England, Wales and Ireland. As the authority granted was hereditary, some counties palatine legally survived well past the end of the feudal period.

==History==
===Durham, Chester, and Lancaster===

Palatinates emerged in England in the decades following the Norman conquest, as various earls or bishops were granted palatine (&quot;from the palace&quot;) powers, i.e. powers of a sort elsewhere exercised by the king. In some places this may have been in part a defensive measure, enabling local authorities to organise the defence of vulnerable frontier areas at their own discretion, avoiding the delays involved in seeking decisions from the court and removing obstructions to the coordinated direction of local resources at the discretion of a single official. However, palatine powers were also granted over areas such as the Isle of Ely which were not near any frontier.
Palatine powers over Cheshire were acquired by the earls of Chester, a title which has since 1254 been reserved for the heir apparent to the throne (apart from a brief tenure in 1264–1265 by Simon de Montfort, who had seized control of the government from Henry III). Chester had its own parliament, consisting of barons of the county, and was not represented in Parliament until 1543, while it retained some of its special privileges until 1830.

Exceptional powers were also granted to the bishops of Durham, who during the aftermath of the Norman conquest had been put in charge of secular administration in what became County Durham. The autonomous power exercised by these bishops over the County Palatine of Durham was particularly enduring: Durham did not gain parliamentary representation until 1654, while the bishops of Durham retained their temporal jurisdiction until 1836.
Palatine powers over Lancashire were conferred on the first duke of Lancaster in 1351, at the same time as his promotion from the status of earl. This was only the second dukedom created in England, following that of Cornwall in 1337, which also became associated with palatine powers. The dukedom was united with the Crown on the accession of Henry IV in 1399, but the vast estates of the Duchy of Lancaster were never assimilated into the Crown Estate, continuing even today to be separately administered for the monarch as Duke of Lancaster. The rights exercised through the Duchy, rather than the Crown, included its palatine powers over Lancashire, the last of which were revoked only in 1873. In the county palatine of Lancaster, the loyal toast is to &quot;the King, Duke of Lancaster&quot;.

The king&#x27;s writs did not run in these three palatine counties until the nineteenth century and, until the 1970s, Lancashire and Durham had their own courts of chancery (see Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Lancaster and Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Durham and Sadberge).

The appeal against a decision of the county court of a county palatine had, in the first instance, to be to the court of common pleas of that county palatine.

===Other counties palatine===
Outside England, a county palatine was the land ruled by a count palatine, a title dating back to pre-feudal Roman times and originally referring to a non-hereditary court official entrusted with judicial duties. In the medieval era these offices became hereditary and associated with feudal rulers, the most prominent and long-lasting being the Count Palatine of the Rhine, an elector of the Holy Roman Empire.

At various times in history, the following areas had palatinate status: Shropshire, Kent, the Isle of Ely, Hexhamshire in Northumberland, and, in Wales, the Earldom of Pembroke (until the passing of the Laws in Wales Act 1535).

Although not formally categorised as a palatinate, in Cornwall many of the rights associated with palatinates were conferred on the Duke of Cornwall, a title created in 1337 and always held by the heir apparent to the throne.

In the history of Wales in the Norman era, the term most often used is Marcher Lord, which is similar to, but not strictly the same as, a Palatine Lord. Nevertheless, a number of strictly Palatine jurisdictions were created in Wales.

There were several palatine districts in Ireland of which the most notable were those of the Earls of Desmond and the Earls of Ormond in County Tipperary. The latter continued in existence until it was abolished by the County Palatine of Tipperary Act 1715.

In Scotland, the earldom of Strathearn was identified as a county palatine in the fourteenth century, although the title of Earl of Strathearn has usually been merged with the crown in subsequent centuries and there is little indication that the status of Strathearn differed in practice from other Scottish earldoms.

In the colonies, the historic Province of Avalon in Newfoundland was granted palatine status, as was Maryland under Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore.

<text>The Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery) at the Kulturforum is a museum for modern art in Berlin, with its main focus on the 20th century. It is part of the National Gallery of the Berlin State Museums. The museum building and its sculpture gardens were designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and opened on September 15th, 1968.

The gallery closed in 2015 for renovation. The work, by David Chipperfield Architects, was completed in 2021, and the museum reopened in August 2021 with an exhibition of works by American sculptor Alexander Calder.

==Architecture==

===Dimensions, specifications and materials===

The plan of the Neue Nationalgalerie is divided into two distinct stories. The upper story serves as an entrance hall as well as the primary special exhibit gallery, totaling of space. It is elevated from street level and only accessible by three flights of steps. Though it only comprises a small portion of the total gallery space, the exhibition pavilion stands boldly as the building&#x27;s primary architectural expression. Eight cruciform columns, two on each length placed so as to avoid corners, support a square pre-stressed steel roof plate thick and painted black. An cantilever allows for ample space between the gallery&#x27;s glazed façade and eight supporting columns. Mies&#x27; office studied this cantilever extensively in various scaled models in order to ensure its structural stability as well as the seeming flatness of the roof plate. The floor-to-ceiling height reaches , and the space is (laid) out on a square dimensional grid. Black anodized aluminum &quot;egg crates&quot; fit within the grid house lighting fixtures, with air ducts suspended above.

The lower story serves primarily as housing for the gallery&#x27;s permanent collection, though it also includes a library, offices, and a shop and café, and totals about of space. It is three-quarters below ground so as to allow for safe storage of the artwork. Its sole glazed façade looks out on the museum&#x27;s sloping sculpture garden and provides ample indirect interior lighting.

A rooftop plaza further extends the museum&#x27;s exhibition space.

===Contemporaneous projects===
In 1956, José M. Bosch, President of Ron Bacardí y Compañía approached Mies to commission the design of a new office space. He was particularly interested in a very open plan, and the relatively simple idea Mies came up with involved a square roof plate supported on each side by two columns. Though initial structural challenges had to be dealt with, the resulting pavilion typology became integral to Mies&#x27; architectural lexicon, in many ways the epitome of his universal conception of space.

The Bacardí Building was abandoned in September 1960 due to general political unrest in Cuba, but at the same time, two other museum commissions were brought to Mies&#x27; office. Georg Schaefer, a wealthy industrialist living in Schweinfurt approached Mies about the construction of a museum for his nineteenth-century art collection during the summer of 1960. A modest initial plan was drawn for the structure, but later that year Mies decided to reconfigure the unbuilt Bacardí project to fit Schaefer&#x27;s program as he wished to see it built. Consequently, a scaled-down model of the Bacardí project this time rendered in steel rather than concrete was created. In March 1961, Mies also received a letter from the Senator for Building and Housing in Berlin, inviting him to build what was to be called the Neue Nationalgalerie, an exhibition space for the state&#x27;s collection of early twentieth-century art. The two museum projects, though slightly different in scale, where to be essentially identical in form, both a version in steel of the original Barcardí design. Though the Schweinfurt project never came to fruition, the reductive exercise of continual reconfiguration allowed for the perfection of Mies&#x27; expression in Berlin, and the Neue Nationalgalerie remains as the sole built form of the initial tripartite conception.

===Aesthetic importance===
Much of Mies&#x27; syntactical development throughout the three building progression leading up to the Neue Nationalgalerie was prefigured in an earlier project for a Museum for a Small City. This project was published in a special May 1943 edition of &quot;Architectural Forum&quot;. In his publication, Mies describes a seemingly floating roof plane, suspended above a single clear-span space punctuated by equidistant columns. This project is now seen as a significant move on Mies&#x27; part toward the alleviation of interior space by both defining and minimizing structural enclosure, thus joining exterior and interior space in a meaningful way. The structure itself, a composite of little more than ground plane, support and roof, thus becomes the building. The aesthetic importance of the clear-span was directly related to Mies&#x27; conception of museum space in general, a &quot;defining, rather than confining space&quot;. The completely open nature of the plan also serves to eliminate the barrier between art and community, simultaneously breaking down the reverence enacted by severely partitioned spaces and inviting interaction between viewer and art. The overall aesthetic affect is thus one of vitalizing liberation. This infinitely transformative capability and universality is also seen in Mies&#x27; buildings from the intervening years, namely the Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois, and Crown Hall of the Illinois Institute of Technology campus. Various commentators have recognized the structure&#x27;s ties to classical building, seeing it as a modern temple whose monumental simplicity evinces the immense skill behind its design and conception.

===Criticism===
The ability of clearly articulated external structures to alleviate façades and create large-scale universal spaces required certain boldness on the part of the client. The ineffable expression of the Neue Nationalgalerie&#x27;s entrance pavilion had certain logistical downsides. Its smooth granite flooring reflects the warm natural light that floods the space, creating hazy shadow and making curatorial efforts notoriously complicated. The singular expression of the pavilion space also relegated the lower story to a secondary position, presenting further difficulties for the display of artwork involving a lack of natural lighting and relatively pedestrian layout of viewing space. When asked later to renovate and expand the building&#x27;s lower story, Mies refused, as to do so would destroy the perfect proportions of the temple above. He originally conceived of the entrance pavilion as a place for very large works, allowing for unencumbered visual interaction and for use of the piece as space element in itself. An early collage included in the May 1943 &quot;Architectural Forum&quot; article about Museum for a Small City includes Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, along with other large, plane-like paintings. Yet smaller works had to be shown on moveable freestanding walls or hanging partitions, making a curator&#x27;s ability to effectively differentiate spaces difficult.

===David Chipperfield renovation===
Having had no thorough modernization since its inauguration, the Neue Nationalgalerie required upgrades to its air-conditioning, lighting, security, accessibility, electricity, visitor facilities and the behind-the-scenes infrastructure for moving art. In 2012 it was announced that British architect David Chipperfield would oversee a major renovation of the building. In a non-competitive selection process common for public contracts in Germany, his firm was chosen for the contract out of 24 architectural firms based on a two-stage negotiation process. 

Originally planned for €101 million, the €140 million renovation project started in 2015 and was originally expected to last three years, during which time the museum was closed. Original building elements, such as handrails and shelves, were removed, restored and reinstalled in their previous locations. Archival material dating from the construction at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, helped the architects remain true to Mies&#x27;s design. Meanwhile, the structural framework of the roof, which rests on eight steel beams, and the glass facade was restored.

==Collection==
The collection features a number of unique highlights of modern 20th-century art. Particularly well represented are Cubism, Expressionism, the Bauhaus and Surrealism. The collection owns masterpieces of artists like Pablo Picasso, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Joan Miró, Wassily Kandinsky and Barnett Newman. The design of the building, despite its large size, allows for the display of only a small part of the collection, and the displays are therefore changed at intervals.
==Permanent art installations==
The Neue Nationalgalerie&#x27;s ceiling, constructed as a grid of black-painted steel beams, has been used as an exhibit surface in itself for &quot;Installation for the Neue Nationalgalerie&quot;, an installation of long lines of LCD displays by artist Jenny Holzer in 2001, which continuously scrolled abstract patterns down their length.

The Neue Nationalgalerie&#x27;s terrace provides a particularly prominent space for large-scale pieces of sculpture from the 20th century. Permanently installed sculptures include &quot;Gudari&quot; (1957) by Eduardo Chillida, &quot;Polis&quot; (1968) by Joannis Avramidis, the kinetic metal sculpture &quot;Vier Vierecke im Geviert&quot; (1969) by George Rickey, &quot;Three Way Piece No.2: The Archer&quot; (1964–65) by Henry Moore, &quot;Têtes et Queue&quot; (1965) by Alexander Calder, and &quot;Berlin Block Charlie Chaplin&quot; (1978) by Richard Serra. In 2003, with the permission of the Barnett Newman Foundation, a fourth edition of the sculpture &quot;Broken Obelisk&quot; (1963) by Barnett Newman was cast and temporarily installed in front of the museum. In 2011, Thomas Schütte&#x27;s work &quot;Vater Staat&quot; (2010) was donated by Nicolas Berggruen and installed on the terrace. Many other pieces of sculpture - by artists from Auguste Renoir to Ulrich Rückriem - are on permanent display in the museum&#x27;s garden.

<doc id="623906" wikidata="Q288305" url="?curid=623906" title="Eric Moussambani">
<text>Eric Moussambani Malonga (born 31 May 1978) is an Equatoguinean swimmer. Nicknamed Eric the Eel by the media, Moussambani won brief international fame at the 2000 Summer Olympics for an extremely unlikely victory. Moussambani, who had never seen an Olympic-sized (50 meters) swimming pool before, swam his heat of the 100 m freestyle on 19 September in a time of 1:52.72. This was the slowest time in Olympic history by far, and Moussambani had trouble finishing the race, but he won his heat after both his competitors were disqualified due to false starts. Although Moussambani&#x27;s time was still too slow to advance to the next round, he set a new personal best and an Equatoguinean national record. He later became the coach of the national swimming squad of Equatorial Guinea.

== Career ==
Moussambani gained entry to the Olympics without meeting the minimum qualification requirements via a wildcard draw designed to encourage participation by developing countries lacking full training facilities. Pieter van den Hoogenband won in a time of 48.30 seconds (setting a world record of 47.84 in the semi-finals); Moussambani took more than twice that time to finish (1:52.72). &quot;The last 15 metres were very difficult&quot;, Moussambani said. Because the other two swimmers in his heat made false starts and were thus disqualified, he won the heat unopposed.

Before coming to the Olympics, Moussambani had never seen a Olympic-size swimming pool. He took up swimming eight months before the Olympics and had practiced in a lake, and later a swimming pool in a hotel in Malabo, that he was given access to only between 5 and 6 am.

Moussambani&#x27;s performance generated spectator and media interest in Paula Barila Bolopa, the only other Equatoguinean swimmer at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Bolopa competed in the women&#x27;s 50 metres freestyle event, struggling to finish the race with a time of 1:03.97. In setting a record for the slowest time in Olympic history for that event, she also achieved major celebrity status.

In 2001, Moussambani competed in the 50 metres freestyle at the 2001 World Aquatics Championship in Fukuoka, Japan, finishing 88th out of 92 athletes. He set a new Equatorial Guinean record for the distance. He was the first male athlete in the nation&#x27;s history ever to participate in the event.

Despite eventually lowering his personal best in the 100 metres freestyle to under 57 seconds, Moussambani was denied entry into the 2004 Olympic Games due to a visa bungle. He did not take part in the 2008 Summer Olympics. In March 2012 he was appointed coach of the national swimming squad of Equatorial Guinea.

== Similarly acclaimed athletes ==
In subsequent Olympic Games, international media occasionally referred to Moussambani&#x27;s potential successors—athletes who might record poor times. Before the 2008 Summer Olympics, media in several countries—including Australia, Denmark, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom—suggested that Stany Kempompo Ngangola, a swimmer from DR Congo, would be the Olympics&#x27; next &quot;Eric the Eel&quot;. The media also described ni-Vanuatu sprinter Elis Lapenmal and Palestinian swimmer Hamza Abdu as &quot;potential successors to Moussambani&quot;. During the Games, Cook Islands swimmer Petero Okotai compared himself to &quot;Eric the Eel&quot; upon recording a disappointing time in his event. In the 2016 Olympic Games, Ethiopian swimmer Robel Habte was dubbed &quot;Robel the Whale&quot; after finishing half a lap behind his competitors in the 100-metre freestyle.

During the 2009 IAAF World Championships, various media around the world, including &quot;La Nación&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, described American Samoan sprinter Savannah Sanitoa as &quot;the new Eric &#x27;the Eel&#x27; Moussambani&quot;. London 2012 Olympic rower Hamadou Djibo Issaka of Niger was compared to Moussambani for his times of 8:25.56 in the men&#x27;s single sculls qualifying heat and 9:07.99 in the E Semi-finals. Both times were over a minute off the next closest competitor in each race. Moussambani&#x27;s exploits also triggered comparisons to the 1988 Winter Olympics, when both British ski-jumper Eddie the Eagle and the Jamaican bobsled team became objects of interest and amusement due to their improbable participation in their sports.

<doc id="623908" wikidata="Q1354582" url="?curid=623908" title="Train surfing">
<text>Train surfing (also known as train hopping or train hitching) is typically a reckless, dangerous, and illegal act of riding on the outside of a moving train, tram, or other forms of rail transport. In a number of countries, the term &#x27;train hopping&#x27; is used synonymously with freight hopping, which means riding on the outside of a freight train, while train surfing can be practiced on any type of train. This type of travelling can be extremely dangerous and even life-threatening, because there is a risk of death or serious injury due to falling off a moving train, electrocution by the power supply (overhead catenary wire, third rail, current collectors, resistors, etc.), colliding with railway infrastructure such as bridges, tunnels, station platforms, trackside buildings, railway signals or other trains, while riding outside of structure gauge on the side or on the roof of a train, or unsuccessful attempts to jump onto a moving train or off it. Today, the practice is illegal by statutes on many railroads in the world. Despite this, it is still practiced, especially on those railroads where the trains are overcrowded.

== History ==

The phenomenon of riding on the outside of trains came with the appearance of the first railway lines. On a series of first railroads, riding on rooftops and footboards of trains was common, but over time, starting from the second half of the 19th century, with an increase in the sizes and speed of trains, passenger coaches began to be produced fully covered and insulated from streets with a placement of all passenger seats inside carriages in order to improve the safety of passengers and prevent people falling from a moving train. However, some individuals continued riding on the outside of trains to travel without having a ticket.

In the United States, this became a common means of transportation following the American Civil War as the railroads began pushing westward, especially among migrant workers who became known as &quot;hobos&quot;. It continued to be widely used by those unable to afford other transportation, especially during times of widespread economic dislocation such as the Great Depression.

In the first half of the 20th century during the era of trams rising in Europe and USA, trams in some cities became overcrowded, so some passengers began a practice of riding on footboards, doors, couplers and sometimes on the roofs of trams. Also, train surfing often occurred in European countries during the war conflicts, especially during the First World War, Russian Civil War and World War II. Soldiers and refugees often traveled on the roofs of carriages due to lack of seats inside.

In the mid-20th century, European and American railroad companies in many countries took measures to reduce overcrowding in cars and prevent riding outside of them, so the prevalence of train surfing in those countries decreased. However, in some countries of Southeast Asia and Africa with a high population density, the problem of overcrowding of different vehicles, including trains, grew rapidly, so train surfing in those countries became a widespread phenomenon.

As an extreme hobby, train surfing firstly appeared in South Africa during the 1980s among teenagers from poor families, and then began to appear in other countries around the world. Teenagers as young as 13 were reported as train surfing in Rio de Janeiro in 1988. During the 1990s, train surfing on a commuter electric multiple unit train became popular in Europe among young people who live near railway lines.

In Germany, the practice of S-Bahn surfing was made popular during the 1990s. The phenomenon was forgotten until the millennium, but in 2005 it was rediscovered by a group of train surfers from Frankfurt, Germany. The leader of the crew who calls himself &quot;the Trainrider&quot; surfed the InterCityExpress, the fastest train in Germany. An Internet video claimed that he died a year later from an incurable form of leukemia, but later the Trainrider revealed in an interview that this video was made by a fan and the story of his death was a hoax.

In the Soviet Union during the 1980s teens and youths sometimes surfed trams. The practice of surfing on electric trains appeared during the 1990s in Russia and some other post-Soviet countries due to the economic crisis and growing interest among teens and youths who lived near the railroads. In around the year 2000 they also began to surf subway trains in tunnels in the Moscow Metro and organized train-surfing crews and web-communities.Beginning in the mid-2000s there were frequent cancellations of commuter trains and crowding inside rail cars in the Moscow region. In the summer of 2010 dozens of commuter trains were cancelled due to track repairs on the Moscow railway and the crowding of trains and the number of train surfers in the Moscow region rose dramatically. This was when train surfing for the first time became a wide phenomenon on Russian railways and it caused a big scandal. Train surfing was mostly a teenager hobby before this. After the railroad track repairs were completed overcrowding on trains began to reduce and the number of ordinary passengers who were roof riding disappeared. Roof riding among teenagers became more popular and they began to create a community of train surfers and post videos on YouTube. Train surfers began to organize meetings and big-way surfing events on the outside of commuter, subway and local freight trains via the Internet. Russian train-surfing fans began to call themselves and also name their hobby (from the Russian word &quot;Зацепиться-Zatsepitsya&quot; translated as &quot;to catch on&quot;). Train surfing became something like an extreme sport discipline for them. From the beginning of 2011, Russian train surfers made several rides on the outside of the high-speed Siemens Velaro train &quot;Sapsan&quot;, the fastest train in Russia.

In Indonesia, especially Greater Jakarta, large numbers of people train surf, especially since the late 1990s, as gridlock grips this metropolis of 30 million without a single metro system, and the city comes up with alternative transport such as car jockeys. Jakarta traffic is the most gridlocked in Southeast Asia, perhaps among the worst worldwide. It has built a bus rapid transit system, but with little success, as there is no separation from the heavy traffic. The tropical heat and urban heat island effect also makes the top the only place on the train with plenty of air circulation. Since 2013 the practice has been eliminated after the state railway company Kereta Api Indonesia modernized the ticketing system, allowing tickets to be sold up to 90 days in advance, and including check in requirements along with increasing number of rolling stocks. On KRL commuter services, stations are modernized by installing turnstiles, implementing contactless payment and locking down the station. All non-commuter train now have passenger limit of 100 to 110% while previously a service could run at 200% or more capacity.

== Current state ==

Train surfing is a common and usual way to ride trains in countries such as Bangladesh and South Africa, where this type of riding by trains is compelled due to the high population density and severe overcrowding of trains. This practice is a serious issue in these countries where people have been killed or injured in numerous accidents. However, train surfing can occur in any area with trains and trams. Individuals may train-surf to avoid the cost of a ticket or as a recreational activity.

With the creation of the internet, the practice of filming the act and posting online videos of it is on the increase worldwide. Train surfers can use social networks to find and communicate with each other and organize trips by trains in small groups. In countries where a big community of train surfers exists, they sometimes organize major events of riding on the outside of local trains, where dozens of riders participate.

Some railroad workers, such as shunters or conductors, are often allowed to ride on exterior parts of trains during shunting operations, but with many limitations.
== Motivation ==

Passengers who practice train surfing consider it as an extreme hobby, or to get a free ride by train, which has a number of advantages in comparison with riding inside a railcar:
* enjoyment of riding and feeling of speed;
* extended view of surrounding area in comparison with the view from a window inside a railcar;
* avoiding the cost of a ticket;
* to ride a train which is full, crowded or extremely hot inside railcars;
* to catch a slow moving train which has started to depart;
* to ride on a train which does not transport passengers (e.g. a freight train, service train, or single locomotive);
* to produce content to be shared on the internet.

== Hazards==
Hazards that occur whilst train surfing include falling off a moving train, falling underneath the train, colliding with buildings, structures and objects that are close to the train&#x27;s path as it moves along the railway track and electrocution from power supply.

A person can receive an electric shock from an overhead power line or conductor rail when their body comes into contact with it.

A person can receive an electric shock from an electric arc without their body actually touching an overhead power line. An electric arc can go from an overhead power line and pass through the air and then make contact with a person&#x27;s body. When this electric arc reaches a person&#x27;s body they can then receive an electric shock from it.

===Injuries and deaths===
In the decade before August 2000, in Brazil, there were 100 people who died in more than 200 accidents.

In South Africa in 2006, 19 people died whilst train surfing with a further 100 train-surfing accidents occurring.

In Indonesia, in two years before 2008, 53 people died whilst train surfing.

In the Russian Central Federal District in 2015 there were 24 people injured whilst train surfing and in 2016 in the Central Federal District there were 9 people who died whilst train surfing.

In New York, from 1989 to 2011, there were 13 people who died and 56 people injured train surfing.

In New York City, on October 23rd, 2024, a 13-year-old boy became the 5th person to die in 2024 from subway surfing. 

In Ukraine, in 2017, there were 12 people who died whilst train surfing.

== Prevention and punishments ==

Train surfing is illegal on most railways in the world, with some exceptions. Many railroad companies usually take a zero tolerance policy to practice of riding on exterior parts of trains, and employ railway police and guards in an attempt to prevent the practice. Police officers and guards usually patrol the territory of large passenger stations and freight yards, and can arrest train surfers if they are spotted. In some countries, railway police can patrol the territory of railways in utility trucks, SUVs (&quot;bullmobiles&quot;), or even standard police cars. In countries where the practice of trains surfing occurs regularly, the police frequently organize raids in order to detect and remove surfers off the trains and arrest them. The most common form of penalty for train surfers is a fine. However, in some countries, such as the United States or Canada, train surfers can be not only fined, but imprisoned too.

In the United Kingdom, train surfing is prohibited under railway byelaw No. 10, which prohibits travelling in or on any train except in areas of the train intended for use by that person.

At least 87 people were arrested in the last four months of 2010 in Melbourne for offences relating to train surfing. In Russia, over 1000 train surfers were arrested at the Moscow Railway during ten months of 2011. In India, 153 people were prosecuted in a single day in June 2012 for train surfing on the Central Railway.

=== Deterrents ===

To reduce the practice of riding on the outside of trains, railway companies often place signs that warn about the dangers of train surfing. While there are no official numbers, the London Underground ran a public awareness campaign against &quot;tube surfing&quot;.

The Indonesian railway company, PT Kereta Api, has tried several methods to deter train surfers. Early methods included spraying those caught with red paint and placing barbed wire on train roofs. In 2012, the company began suspending heavy concrete balls above the railway, a short distance from the stations. This method was criticised as being potentially lethal.

<text>Eldfell is a volcanic cone just over high on the Icelandic island of Heimaey. It formed in a volcanic eruption which began without warning on the eastern side of Heimaey, in the Westman Islands, on 23 January 1973. The name means &quot;Hill of Fire&quot; in Icelandic.

The eruption caused a major crisis for the island and led to its temporary evacuation. Volcanic ash fell over most of the island, destroying around 400 homes, and a lava flow threatened to close off the harbour, the island&#x27;s main income source via its fishing fleet. An operation was mounted to cool the advancing lava flow by pumping sea water onto it, which was successful in preventing the loss of the harbour.

After the eruption, the islanders used heat from the cooling lava flows to provide hot water and to generate electricity. They also used some of the extensive tephra, fall-out of airborne volcanic material, to extend the runway at the island&#x27;s small airport and as landfill on which 200 new houses were built.

==Background==
Iceland is a region of frequent volcanic activity, due to its location astride the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, where the North American and Eurasian Plates are moving apart, and also over the Iceland hotspot, which greatly enhances the volcanic activity. It is estimated that a third of all the basaltic lava erupted in the world in recorded history has been produced by Icelandic eruptions.

The Vestmannaeyjar (Westman Islands) archipelago lies off the south coast of Iceland, and consists of several small islands, all formed by eruptions in the Holocene epoch. Heimaey, the largest island in the group and the only inhabited one, also contains some material from the Pleistocene era. The most prominent feature on Heimaey before 1973 was Helgafell, a 200 meters (650 ft) high volcanic cone formed in an eruption about 5,000 years ago.

The Vestmannaeyjar archipelago was settled in about 874 AD, originally by escaped Insular slaves belonging to Norse settlers on the mainland. These settlers gave the islands their name, Britain and Ireland being west of mainland Scandinavia. Although plagued by poor water supplies and piracy during much of its history, Heimaey became the most important center of the Icelandic fishing industry, having one of the few good harbors on the southern side of the country, and being situated in very rich fishing grounds.

==Eruption==
At about 20:00 on 21 January 1973, a series of small tremors began to occur around Heimaey. They were too weak to be felt by the residents of the island, but a seismic station away, near the mainland, recorded over 100 large tremors between 01:00 and 03:00 on 22 January that appeared to be emanating from south of Heimaey. The tremors continued at a reduced rate until 11:00 that day, after which they stopped until 23:00 that evening. From 23:00 until 01:34 on 23 January, seven tremors were detected that grew shallower and more intense, while the epicenter moved closer to the town of Vestmannaeyjar.
The largest tremor measured 2.7 on the Richter scale.

Small tremors are very common at plate boundaries, and nothing here indicated that they heralded a major eruption. The onset of the eruption was therefore almost entirely unexpected. At about 01:55 on 23 January, a fissure opened up on the eastern side of the island, barely a kilometre away from the centre of the town of Heimaey, approximately 200 metres (650 ft) east of Kirkjubær (&quot;Church farm&quot;), where the island&#x27;s church had once been located.

The fissure rapidly extended from 300 metres to a length of , crossing the island from one shore to the other. Submarine activity also occurred just offshore at the northern and southern ends of the fissure. Spectacular lava fountaining 50 to 150 metres high occurred along the whole fissure, which reached a maximum length of about during the first few hours of the eruption, but activity soon became concentrated on one vent, about north of the old volcanic cone of Helgafell and just outside the eastern edge of the town.

During the early days of the eruption, the rate of lava and tephra emission from the fissure was estimated to be 100 cubic metres per second (3,500 cubic feet per second), and within two days, the lava fountains had built a cinder cone over 100 metres (330 ft) high. The name initially given to the new volcano was Kirkjufell (&quot;Church Mountain&quot;), owing to its proximity to Kirkjubær. This name was not adopted by the official Icelandic place-naming committee, who chose Eldfell (&quot;Fire Mountain&quot;) instead, despite local opposition. The fountains&#x27; Strombolian eruptions continued until 19 February, depositing thick tephra over the northern half of the island and adding to the cone until it was 200 metres (660 ft) high.
The eruption column that caused the air fall &quot;occasionally rose to 9,000 metres (30,000 ft), or nearly to the tropopause&quot;. Lava flows from the cone traveled north and east to produce a &quot;continuously expanding lava delta&quot; along the east coast of the island and into the harbor, where small explosions built up a diminutive island that was soon overtaken by the advancing delta.

The first lavas erupted by Eldfell had a mugearitic chemical composition but within a few weeks the volcano was erupting less fractionated lavas which had a hawaiitic composition.
By early May, the lava flow was between in height. It averaged more than and in some places was as much as thick. The flow carried off large blocks from the main cone that had broken off, as well as volcanic bombs. &quot;The viscosity of the lava fragments ejected by the blasts was, for basalt, relatively high. Very little spatter was produced and scoria bombs sometimes broke up explosively in flight (presumably due to rapid vesiculation), and by rapid impact on landing.&quot; The high viscosity led to a &quot;massive, blocky aā lava flow which moved slowly but relentlessly toward the north, northeast, and east.&quot;

Volcanic gases were collected from several locations. Gases collected at sea along the submerged part of active eruptive fissure were dominantly carbon dioxide and gases from cooling submerged lava flows were about 70 percent hydrogen. (Richard &amp; James, 1983) Poisonous gas was found at low areas on the eastern part of Vestmannaeyjar. A wall was constructed between the vent and town to divert the gas, and a long trench was excavated for the steam to escape. However, none of these measures were completely effective. (Richard &amp; James, 1983)

==Evacuation==
In the early hours of the eruption, the Icelandic State Civil Defence Organisation evacuated the entire population of Heimaey, having previously developed evacuation plans for an emergency such as this. The evacuation was necessary because lava flows were already moving slowly into the eastern side of town, and the whole of the small island was threatened by the likelihood of heavy ash fall.

Because of severe storms in the days before the eruption, almost the entire fishing fleet was in the harbour, a stroke of luck which greatly assisted the organisation of the rapid evacuation. The population was alerted to the situation by fire engines sounding their sirens, and gathered by the harbour with just the small amount of possessions they were able to carry. The first boats left for Þorlákshöfn at about 02:30, just half an hour after the start of the eruption.

Most of the population left the island by boat. Fortunately, the lava flows and tephra fall did not at first affect the island&#x27;s airstrip (Vestmannaeyjar Airport), and a few people who were unable to travel by boat were evacuated by air—primarily the elderly and patients from the hospital. Planes were sent from Reykjavík and Keflavik to help speed the process. Within six hours of the onset of the eruption, almost all of the 5,300 people of the island were safely on the mainland. A few people remained to carry out essential functions and to salvage belongings from threatened houses. Cattle, horses and sheep on the island were slaughtered. On the mainland, friends, relatives and strangers offered shelter and housing. By the end of the day, all 5,300 people were spread around cities and towns on the mainland.

==Destruction of houses, creation of land==

Houses close to the rift were soon destroyed by lava flows and tephra fall. A few days after the eruption began, the prevailing wind direction moved to the west, resulting in extensive tephra falls over the rest of the island, causing extensive property damage. Many houses were destroyed by the weight of the ash fall, but crews of volunteers working to clear the ash from roofs and board up windows saved many more. By the end of January, tephra covered most of the island, reaching 5 metres (16 ft) deep in places. Apart from falling ash, some houses were also burned down by fires caused by lava bombs, or overridden by advancing lava flows.

By early February, the heavy tephra fall had abated, but lava flows began to cause serious damage. Submarine activity just north of the fissure severed an electric power cable and a water pipeline which supplied electrical power and water from the Icelandic mainland, and lava began to flow towards the harbour, a situation which caused serious concerns - if the harbour was blocked, the island&#x27;s fishing industry would be devastated. By early May, about 300 buildings had been engulfed by lava flows or gutted by fire and 60-70 homes had been buried by tephra.(Richard &amp; James, 1983) As Heimaey was responsible for some 3% of Iceland&#x27;s GNP, the effect on the whole country&#x27;s economy would be significant. Efforts to prevent the loss of the harbour are described further below.
Lava flows also moved into the sea east of the island, creating new land that would eventually add over to the island, and into the eastern parts of town, destroying several hundred houses. The flows were thick and blocky aā lava (Icelandic: ) flows, and covered the ground to average depths of about 40 metre (130 ft), reaching 100 metre (330 ft) thick in places. Later on in the eruption, a surge of lava destroyed one fish processing plant and damaged two others, and also demolished the town&#x27;s power generating plant.

Despite the eruption&#x27;s close proximity to the town and the extensive property damage, only one fatality could be attributed to the eruption - a man who had broken into a chemist&#x27;s store to acquire drugs was suffocated by toxic fumes. Carbon dioxide, with small amounts of poisonous gases, became concentrated in many buildings partially buried by tephra, and several other people were affected when entering these buildings.

Efforts to mitigate the hazards presented by the accumulation of poisonous gas included the building of a large tephra wall to divert gases away from the town, and the digging of a trench to channel away the CO2 (carbon dioxide). These defences were only partially effective, as they relied on the assumption that the gases were produced at the vent, and flowed into the town from there. It is believed that as least some of the CO2 originated deep within the volcanic conduit and percolated through older volcanic rocks, rising directly into the town.

==Lava-cooling operations==

The possibility of lava flows cutting off the harbour was the most significant threat facing the town. One contingency plan devised, should the harbour be closed off, was to cut through a low sand spit on the north side of the island to provide a new channel into the harbour, but it was hoped that if the lava flow could be slowed, this would not be necessary. Lava flows had been sprayed with water in attempts to slow them in Hawaii and on Mount Etna, but these had been rather small-scale operations with limited success. However, Professor Þorbjörn Sigurgeirsson carried out an experiment that proved that further advances of the lava could be impeded by prematurely solidifying the advancing lava-flow front.

The first attempt to slow the lava flow by spraying the leading edge with sea water began on 6 February, and although the volume of water being pumped on was rather small at 100 litres per second (26 US (liquid) gallons per second), the flow was noticeably affected. The lava changed as water poured on it. Before cooling, the flow of the lava was blocky, covered with volcanic bombs and was a reddish oxidised colour. After cooling, the surface became more jagged and was much more difficult to walk on, and the flow surface turned from black to grey. (Richard &amp; James, 1983) Water cooling of the lava was slow but efficient, with almost all the water converted to steam. Once the viability of lava cooling had been proven, efforts to halt the flows were increased.

The pumping capacity was increased in early March, when a large chunk of the crater wall broke away from the summit of Eldfell and began to be carried along the top of the lava flow towards the harbour. The chunk, dubbed Flakkarinn (&quot;The Wanderer&quot;), would have seriously threatened the viability of the harbour if it had reached it, and the dredging boat &quot;Sandey&quot; was brought in on 1 March to prevent its advance. Professor Þorbjörn Sigurgeirsson provided advice to the pumping crews on where to direct their efforts to most efficiently slow the flows. Eventually the Wanderer broke up into two pieces which both stopped approximately 100 metres (330 ft) from the harbour mouth.

The ensuing lava-cooling operations were the most ambitious that had ever been undertaken. &quot;Sandey&quot; was able to spray up to 400 litres per second (105 US gallons per second) onto the advancing flow, and a network of pipes was laid on top of the lava to distribute the seawater over as wide an area as possible. Wooden supports for the pipes caught fire where the lava was hottest, and even aluminium supports melted, but the pipes themselves were prevented from melting by the cold seawater flowing through them. Up to 12,000 square metres (3 acres) of lava flow could be cooled at one time, with internal barriers then being created within the flow, which thickened and piled up upon itself.
The work involved in laying pipes over an active lava flow was highly dangerous, with low visibility due to the extensive emission of steam. Rough tracks were made onto the flow by bulldozing tephra, but these tracks quickly became very uneven and moved several metres a day. The pipelayers used bulldozers and walkie-talkies to advance through the steam to lay more pipes. The workers dubbed themselves &#x27;The Suicide Squad&#x27;, and managed to lay pipes up to 130 metres (430 ft) inward from the flow front, directly over the advance. Although several men sustained minor burns, no serious injuries were received.

By the end of March, a fifth of the town had been covered by lava flows, and increased pumping capacity was required. Thirty-two pumps, each with a capacity of up to 1000 litres per second (265 US gallons per second), were brought in from the United States. After these pumps began to cool the flow advancing towards the town, its movement slowed dramatically and soon stopped. Failure of pump shafts became a problem after a few weeks, probably because they were designed for pumping oil rather than water, and new and improved shafts had to be manufactured in Reykjavík and brought in.

One notable feature of the lava cooling operation was the deposit of large amounts of salt where seawater was sprayed onto the lava. Large expanses of flow became encrusted with extensive white deposits, and it was estimated that up to 220,000 tonnes (240,000 short tons) of salt was deposited in total.

Sigurgeirsson called these protective measures &quot;undoubtedly the most extensive that have ever been used in a volcanic eruption&quot; and said that &quot;had it not been for the cooling, the lava tongue [into the harbor] could be expected to…extend further along its direction of movement…for a whole month longer than it actually did. It failed by only about 100 meters to block the entrance to the harbor&quot;.

The cooling operation ended on 10 July 1973, and approximately 7.3 million cubic metres of seawater were pumped. This eruption was a special case where the method used to control the lava was suited to local conditions. Firstly, the initial eruption was only from the centre of town and harbour. Next, the flow of lava was slow and allowing time to plan and carry out control. Thirdly, sea water was available in its nearby harbour and lastly, it was easy to move pipes and pump equipment as the transport system by sea and road was good. (Richard &amp; James, 1983) The entire operation cost a total of US$1,447,742 at the time.

The eruption made headlines around the world when it began, and was covered constantly by Icelandic news crews throughout. In Europe, the eruption was one of the biggest news items while it continued, competing for front-page space with breakthroughs then being made in the Vietnam War peace talks in Paris. The efforts of the islanders to halt the lava flows received particular attention, with coverage in publications such as National Geographic.
The attention focused on the island as a result of the eruption led to a later upsurge in tourism once the eruption was over.

==Final stages==

The volume of lava being emitted during the eruption fell steadily after the first few days. From its initial rate of , the emission rate fell to about by 8 February, and just by the middle of March. The decline was slower after that, but by the middle of April the flow rate had fallen to about .

Short-lived submarine activity was discovered by a fishing vessel on 26 May, about northeast of Heimaey and off the coast of the mainland. The eruption finally came to an end in early July, when flowing lava was no longer visible, although subsurface flows may have continued for a few days longer. Shortly before the end of the eruption, a tiltmeter from the crater which had been measuring ground deformation throughout the eruption detected subsidence towards the crater, implying that the shallow magma chamber which had fed the eruption was emptying out.

In total, the volume of lava and tephra emitted during the five-month eruption was estimated to be about . About of new land was added to the island, increasing its pre-eruption area by some 20%. In the end, the harbour entrance was narrowed considerably but not closed off, and the new lava flow acted as a breakwater, improving the shelter afforded by the harbour. Flakkarinn rafted several hundred metres towards the harbour along the top of the lava flow, but came to a halt well away from the water&#x27;s edge.

==Heimaey since the eruption==
By the end of 1975, the population of the Westman Islands had returned to roughly 85% of its pre-eruption level. 42% among those with destroyed houses did not return before the end of 1975, while the rate was only 27% among those whose houses were not destroyed. By 1974, fishing companies in the Westman Islands were back to normal production levels. Counter-intuitively, the new lava field actually improved the harbour in Westman Islands. Also counter-intuitive, the forced displacement had a large positive causal effect on both the earnings and education for those who were younger than 25 years old at the time of the eruption.

The insides of lava flows can remain at temperatures of several hundred degrees for many years due to the very low thermal conductivity of rock. Following the end of the eruption, scientists began to assess the feasibility of extracting geothermal heat from the gradually cooling flows. Experimental heating systems were soon devised, and by 1974 the first house was connected. The scheme was extended to several more houses and the hospital, and in 1979 construction began of four larger plants to extract heat from the flows. Each plant extracted energy from a square 100 metres (330 ft) on each side, by percolating water down into the hot parts and collecting the resulting steam. Up to 40 megawatts (MW) of power could be generated by the plants, which also then supplied hot water to nearly every house on the island.

The tephra produced by the eruption was used to extend the runways at the island&#x27;s small airport, and also as landfill on which 200 new homes were built. By mid-1974, about half the pre-eruption population had returned to the island, and by March 1975, about 80% had returned. The recovery and reconstruction of Heimaey was paid for by all Icelanders via a hypothecated sales tax, as well as through international aid totalling US$ 2.1 million primarily from Denmark but with substantial contributions from the United States and several international organisations. With the harbour improved by the new lava breakwater, the fishing industry regained its former vigour and the island today remains the most important fishing centre in the nation, as over a third of Iceland&#x27;s total fish catch is from this harbour.

By the end of the eruption, Eldfell stood about 220 metres (720 ft) above sea level. Since then, its height has dropped by 18 to 20 metres (60 to 65 feet), due to slumping and compacting of the unconsolidated gravelly tephra as well as wind erosion. The islanders have planted grass around the lower slopes of the otherwise bare hill, to stabilise it against further erosion, and eventually it is expected that most of the volcano will be covered by grass, as neighbouring Helgafell is.

<text>Helgafell (, &quot;holy mountain&quot;) is a small mountain on the Snæfellsnes Peninsula of Iceland. The mountain is high. A temple in honor of Thor (&quot;Þór&quot;) was built there by Þórólfr Mostrarskegg, the first settler of the area. 
His biography is described in literary form with fictional and mythical elements in &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot;.

Helgafell also appears in the &quot;Laxdæla saga&quot; as the location where the heroine Guðrún Ósvífrsdóttir last lived and is supposedly where she is buried.

<text>Steven Ray Nagel (October 27, 1946 – August 21, 2014), (Col, USAF), was an American astronaut, aeronautical and mechanical engineer, test pilot, and a United States Air Force pilot. In total, he logged 723 hours in space. After NASA, he worked at the University of Missouri College of Engineering as an instructor in its Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.

==Personal life==
Nagel was born on October 27, 1946, in Canton, Illinois. He was married to fellow astronaut Linda M. Godwin of Jackson, Missouri. They had two daughters. His hobbies included sport flying, amateur radio operations and music. His wife&#x27;s father, James M. Godwin, resides in Oak Ridge, Missouri.

==Education==
Nagel graduated from Canton High School, Canton, Illinois, in 1964; received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering (high honors) from the University of Illinois in 1969, and a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering from California State University, Fresno, in 1978.

==Flight experience==
Nagel received his commission in 1969 through the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) program at the University of Illinois. He completed Undergraduate Pilot Training at Laredo Air Force Base, Texas, in February 1970, and subsequently reported to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, for F-100 training. From October 1970 to July 1971, Nagel was an F-100 pilot with the 68th Tactical Fighter Squadron at England Air Force Base, Louisiana. He served a 1-year tour of duty as a T-28 instructor for the Laotian Air Force at Udon RTAFB, Udon Thani, Thailand, prior to returning to the United States in October 1972 to assume A-7D instructor pilot and flight examiner duties at England Air Force Base, Louisiana.

Nagel attended the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, from February 1975 to December 1975. In January 1976, he was assigned to the 6512th Test Squadron located at Edwards. As a test pilot, he worked on various projects which included flying the F-4 and A-7D.

He logged 12,600 hours flying time—9,640 hours in jet aircraft.

==NASA career==

Nagel became a NASA astronaut in August 1979. His technical assignments included: backup T-38 chase pilot for STS-1; support crew and backup entry spacecraft (CAPCOM) for STS-2; support crew and primary entry CAPCOM for STS-3; software verification at the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) and the Flight Simulation Laboratory (FSL); representing the Astronaut Office in the development of a crew escape system for the Space Shuttle; Acting Chief of the Astronaut Office (1991). With the completion of his fourth flight, Nagel had logged a total of 723 hours in space. Nagel retired from the Air Force, effective February 28, 1995. He retired from the Astronaut Office, effective March 1, 1995, to assume the full-time position of Deputy Director for Operations Development, Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance Office, Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. In September 1996, Nagel transferred to Aircraft Operations Division where he performed duties as a Research Pilot. Nagel was a veteran of four space flights (STS-51-G and STS-61-A in 1985, STS-37 in 1991, and STS-55 in 1993) as described below:

===Spaceflight experience===

Nagel first flew as a mission specialist on STS-51G, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 17, 1985. The crew aboard the Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; deployed communications satellites for Mexico (Morelos), the Arab League (Arabsat), and the United States (AT&amp;T Telstar). They used the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) to deploy and later retrieve the SPARTAN satellite which performed 17 hours of x-ray astronomy experiments while separated from the Space Shuttle. In addition, the crew activated the Automated Directional Solidification Furnace (ADSF), six &quot;Getaway Specials,&quot; participated in biomedical experiments, and conducted a laser tracking experiment as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative. After completing approximately 170 hours of space flight, &quot;Discovery&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 24, 1985.

Nagel then flew as pilot on STS-61A, the West German D-1 Spacelab mission, which launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 30, 1985. This mission was the first in which payload activities were controlled from outside the United States. More than 75 scientific experiments were completed in the areas of physiological sciences, materials processing, biology, and navigation. After completing 111 orbits of the Earth, Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California on November 6, 1985.
On his third flight, Nagel was commander of STS-37, which launched into orbit on April 5, 1991, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and landed on April 11, 1991, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During this mission, the crew aboard the Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; deployed the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory for the purpose of exploring gamma ray sources throughout the universe. The crew and conducted the first scheduled space walk in more than five and one-half years, and the first successful unscheduled spacewalk to free a stuck antenna on the satellite.
Nagel also served as commander of STS-55, the German D-2 Spacelab mission. After launching on April 26, 1993, on the Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;; the crew landed 10 days later on May 6, 1993, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the ambitious mission 89 experiments were performed in many disciplines such as materials processing, life sciences, robotics, technology, astronomy and earth mapping.

In total, he logged 723 hours in space.

==Post-NASA career==
In 2011, Nagel and his wife Linda moved to Columbia, Missouri, where they both were teaching at the University of Missouri. Nagel was a retention specialist in the College of Engineering and instructor in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, specializing in aerospace propulsion; Godwin was a professor in the physics department, specializing in astronomy.

Specifically he worked at the University of Missouri College of Engineering. There he served as an instructor in the university&#x27;s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department.

==Organizations==
Life member of the Order of Daedalians and Alpha Delta Phi; and honorary member of Phi Eta Sigma, Sigma Tau, Tau Beta Pi, and Sigma Gamma Tau.

==Special honors==

Awarded the Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with 7 Oak Leaf Clusters; and for Undergraduate Pilot Training, recipient of the Commander&#x27;s Trophy, the Flying Trophy, the Academic Trophy, and the Orville Wright Achievement Award (Order of Daedalians); also presented the Air Force Meritorious Service Medal (1978).

Recipient of 4 NASA Space Flight Medals, (1985, 1991, 1993), NASA Exceptional Service Medals (1988, 1989), NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal (1992), AAS Flight Achievement Award, STS-37 Crew (1992), Outstanding Alumni Award (University of Illinois, 1992), NASA Distinguished Service Medal (1994), Distinguished Alumni Award (California State University, Fresno, 1994), Lincoln Laureate (State of Illinois, 1994).

<doc id="623920" wikidata="Q637325" url="?curid=623920" title="Giant danio">
<text>The giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) is a species of freshwater ray-finned fish belonging to the family Danionidae. Originating in Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the west coast of India, this species grows to a maximum length of 4–6 inches (10–15 cm), making it one of the largest of the danionins. It is characterized by a blue and yellow, torpedo-shaped body with gray and clear fins.

In the wild, giant danios live in clear streams and rivers among hills at elevations up to 1000 ft (300 m) above sea level. Their native substrate is small gravel. They are native to a tropical climate and prefer water with a 6–8 pH, a water hardness of 5.0–19.0 dGH, and a temperature range of 72–81 °F (22–27 °C). As surface dwellers, their diets consist predominantly of exogenous insects, but is also supplemented by worms and crustaceans.

In captivity, giant danios will usually accept most foods. They are a somewhat aggressive fish, and may bully other fish in community tanks. Giant danios appreciate water movement to simulate the motion of the rivers and fast-moving streams of their origins, and prefer to school.

Giant danios are also used as dither fish in South and Central American cichlid aquariums. The larger cichlids chase and defend their territories against the giant danios, which allows the cichlids to exhibit more natural behavior.

As egg-scatterers, danios produce around 300 eggs in a single spawning. They spawn in clumps of plants.

A so-called &quot;golden giant danio&quot;, sometimes seen, is in reality a partial albino fish. &quot;Devario affinis&quot;, &quot;Devario browni&quot;, &quot;Devario malabaricus&quot;, and &quot;Devario strigillifer&quot; were originally deemed synonyms, but are now valid species.

== Diet ==
The main component of giant danios&#x27; diet in the wild are flying insects. This diet is supplemented with aquatic invertebrates such as worms and crustaceans. In captivity giant danios feed on mosquito larvae, chironomous larvae, white worms, chopped earth worms, or commercially available pet food.

== Habitat ==
Giant danios are found in fast-flowing streams, usually in hilly areas. Giant danios prefer shaded and clear water. They also prefer gravel or sand sediment. Giant danios are shoaling fish, meaning they are found in social groups.

== In the aquarium trade ==
Giant have become an extremely popular aquarium fish over the decades. Their flashy coloration combined with an active swimming style and shoaling behavior have enticed many fishkeepers to include this species in their displays. They are most popular in community tank setups where they are mainly peaceful schooling inhabitants, A varied diet will bring out the best colors and they thrive in groups of at least 6 or more, ideally 8-10 will bring out their most natural behaviors. It is recommended this species be kept in a tank that is at least 48&quot; (appx 4 ft long) and include ample open swimming space. They are known jumpers, so a secure lid is extremely important. 

Giant Danios are a tropical fish species and require a tanks water temperature to be at least 70 - 80 degrees F. Their lifespan is on average 5-7 years in captivity, and the ideal pH level is anywhere from 6.0 to 8.0.
== Reproduction and life cycle ==
Giant danio breeding can be induced in captivity. In captivity, breeding is induced by increasing water temperature and creating artificial rain. Juveniles begin to resemble their adult form after 65 days of development. Females are larger than males and also possess a more rounded abdomen. Males interested in spawning chase females and ram into their abdomens with their heads.

== Distribution ==
Giant danios are native to the Indian subcontinent and most of Indochina. Their range runs from Pakistan to Cambodia.

== Importance to humans ==
Giant danios are important in the aquarium trade. About 85% of Indian exports of giant danios are wild caught.

<text>James Hansen Newman (born October 16, 1956) is an American physicist and a former NASA astronaut who flew on four Space Shuttle missions.

== NASA career ==
After graduating from Rice University in 1984, Newman did an additional year of post-doctoral work at Rice. His research interests are in atomic and molecular physics, specifically medium to low energy collisions of atoms and molecules of aeronomic interest. His doctoral work at Rice University was in the design, construction, testing, and use of a new position-sensitive detection system for measuring differential cross sections of collisions of atoms and molecules. In 1985, Dr. Newman was appointed as adjunct professor in the Department of Space Physics and Astronomy at Rice University. That same year he came to work at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, where his duties included responsibility for conducting flight crew and flight control team training for all mission phases in the areas of Orbiter propulsion, guidance, and control. He was working as a simulation supervisor when selected for the astronaut program. In that capacity, he was responsible for a team of instructors conducting flight controller training.

Selected by NASA in January 1990, Newman began astronaut training in July 1990. His technical assignments since then include: Astronaut Office Mission Support Branch where he was part of a team responsible for crew ingress/strap-in prior to launch and crew egress after landing; Mission Development Branch working on the Shuttle on-board laptop computers; Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office, responsible for crew involvement in the development and use of computers on the Space Shuttle and Space Station. Detailed to the Space Shuttle Program Office in March 1999 for a two-year tour of duty, Newman served as the RMS Integration Manager responsible for the Orbiter robotic arm and the Space Vision System. He flew as a mission specialist on STS-51 (1993), STS-69 (1995), STS-88 (1998) and STS-109 (2002). A veteran of four space flights, Dr. Newman has logged over 43 days in space, including six spacewalks totaling 43 hours and 13 minutes. If Dr. Newman could do it all over again, he really wishes he could fly on an ISS Expedition like fellow astronaut classmate Dan Bursch.

Effective December 1, 2002, Newman served as NASA&#x27;s Director, Human Space Flight Programs, Russia. As NASA&#x27;s lead representative to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency (Rosaviakosmos) and its contractors, his role is to continue oversight of all human space flight operations, logistics, and technical functions, including NASA&#x27;s mission operations in Korolev and crew training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City.

While still assigned to the Astronaut Office Newman has also worked in various assignments at NASA. Detailed to the Space Shuttle Program Office from March 1999 to March 2001, Newman served as the Remote Manipulator System (RMS) Integration Manager responsible for the Orbiter Canadian robotic arm and the Space Vision System.

Newman was detailed to the International Space Station (ISS) Program Office from December 2002 through January 2006, serving as NASA&#x27;s Director, Human Space Flight Program, Russia. As the ISS Program Manager&#x27;s lead representative to the Russian Federal Space Agency (Roskosmos) and its contractors, his responsibilities included oversight of NASA&#x27;s human space flight program in Russia. This included NASA operations, logistics, and technical functions in Moscow, at NASA&#x27;s Mission Control Center operations in Korolev, and NASA&#x27;s crew training at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City.

In March 2006, Newman was detailed to the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California, as a NASA Visiting Professor in the NPS Space Systems Academic Group. Newman left NASA in July 2008 to accept a position as Professor, Space Systems at NPS to continue his involvement in teaching and research, with an emphasis on using very small satellites in hands-on education and for focused research projects of national interest.

=== Space flight experience ===
STS-51 &quot;Discovery&quot;, (September 12–22, 1993) was launched from and returned to make the first night landing at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the ten-day flight, the crew of five deployed the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) and the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer on the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (ORFEUS/SPAS). Newman was responsible for the operation of the SPAS, was the backup operator for the RMS, and on flight day five conducted a seven-hour-five-minute spacewalk with Carl Walz. The extravehicular activity (EVA) tested tools and techniques for use on future missions. In addition to working with numerous secondary payloads and medical test objectives, the crew successfully tested a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to determine real-time Shuttle positions and velocities and completed a test routing Orbiter data to on-board laptop computers. STS-51 made 158 orbits of the Earth, traveling 4.1 million miles in 236 hours and 11 minutes.

STS-69 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (September 7–18, 1995), was an eleven-day mission during which the crew successfully deployed and retrieved a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility (WSF). Also on board was the International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker payload, numerous secondary payloads, and medical experiments. Newman was responsible for the crew&#x27;s science involvement with the WSF and was also the primary RMS operator on the flight, performing the WSF and EVA RMS operations. He also operated the on-orbit tests of the Ku-band Communications Adaptor, the Relative GPS experiment, and the RMS Manipulator Positioning Display. The mission was accomplished in 171 Earth orbits, traveling 4.5 million miles in 260 hours, 29 minutes.
STS-88 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (December 4–15, 1998), was the first International Space Station assembly mission. During the twelve-day mission the Unity Module was mated with the Zarya Module. Newman performed three spacewalks with Jerry Ross, totaling 21 hours, 22 minutes. The primary objective of the spacewalks was to connect external power and data umbilicals between Zarya and Unity. Other objectives include setting up the Early Communication antennas, deploying antennas on Zarya that had failed to deploy as expected, installing a sunshade to protect an external computer, installing translation aids, and attaching tools/hardware for use in future EVAs. The crew also performed IMAX Cargo Bay Camera (ICBC) operations, and deployed two satellites, Mighty Sat 1, sponsored by the Air Force, and SAC-A, from Argentina. The mission was accomplished in 185 orbits of the Earth, traveling 4.6 million miles in 283 hours and 18 minutes.

STS-109 &quot;Columbia&quot; (March 1–12, 2002). STS-109 was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission and the 108th flight of the Space Shuttle. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope with new solar arrays, a new power control unit, and a new camera, and also installed a cooler to reactivate an old infrared camera. This work was accomplished during a total of five spacewalks in five consecutive days. Dr. Newman performed two spacewalks with crewmate Mike Massimino, totaling 14 hours and 46 minutes. During the first of these spacewalks, Newman and Massimino replaced an old solar array and a reaction wheel assembly with new units. During their second spacewalk they replaced the old Faint Object Camera with the state-of-the-art Advanced Camera for Surveys, expected to produce a tenfold increase in Hubble&#x27;s capability. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, traveling 3.9 million miles in 262 hours and 10 minutes.

==Military career==
Noriega was a member of the Naval ROTC unit at the University of Southern California and received his commission in the United States Marine Corps in 1981. Following graduation from flight school, he flew CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters with HMM-165 from 1983 to 1985 at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii. Noriega made two 6-month shipboard deployments in the West Pacific/Indian Ocean, including operations in support of the Multinational Peacekeeping Force in Beirut, Lebanon. He completed his tour in Hawaii as the Base Operations Officer for Marine Air Base Squadron 24. In 1986, he was transferred to MCAS Tustin, California, where he served as the aviation safety officer and instructor pilot with HMT-301. In 1988, Noriega was selected to attend the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, where he earned two master of science degrees. Upon graduation in September 1990, he was assigned to United States Space Command in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In addition to serving as a Space Surveillance Center Commander, he was responsible for several software development projects and was ultimately the command representative for the development and integration of the major space and missile warning computer system upgrades for Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station. At the time of his selection, he was serving on the staff of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Okinawa, Japan.

He has logged approximately 2,200 flight hours in various fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.

==NASA career==
Selected by NASA in December 1994, Noriega reported to the Johnson Space Center in March 1995. He completed a year of training and evaluation, and was qualified for assignment as a mission specialist in May 1996. He held technical assignments in the Astronaut Office EVA/Robotics and Operations Planning Branches. Noriega flew on STS-84 in 1997 and STS-97 in 2000. He has logged over 461 hours in space including over 19 EVA hours in 3 spacewalks. Following STS-97, Noriega trained as the backup commander for ISS Expedition 6 and later as a member of the crew of STS-121. In July 2004, Noriega was replaced by Piers Sellers on the crew of STS-121 due to a temporary medical condition. While awaiting future flight assignment Noriega served as Chief, Exploration Systems Engineering Division, Engineering Directorate, Johnson Space Center. In January 2005, Noriega retired from the NASA Astronaut Corps, but continues to serve as the Manager, Advanced Projects Office, Constellation Program, Johnson Space Center.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-84 (May 15–24, 1997), was NASA&#x27;s sixth Space Shuttle mission to rendezvous and dock with the Russian Space Station Mir. During this 9-day mission the crew aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; conducted a number of secondary experiments, and transferred nearly 4 tons of supplies and experiment equipment between &quot;Atlantis&quot; and the Mir station. During STS-84, Noriega logged approximately a total of 239 hours and 20 minutes in space traveling 3.6 million miles in 144 orbits of the Earth.

STS-97 &quot;Endeavour&quot; (November 30 to December 11, 2000) was the fifth Space Shuttle mission dedicated to the assembly of the International Space Station. While docked to the Station, the crew installed the first set of U.S. solar arrays, performed three spacewalks (STS-97 EVA 1, STS-97 EVA 2, and STS-97 EVA 3), in addition to delivering supplies and equipment to the station&#x27;s first resident crew. Mission duration was 10 days, 19 hours, 57 minutes, and traveled 4.5 million miles.

<doc id="623928" wikidata="Q441718" url="?curid=623928" title="Tadatoshi Akiba">
<text>is a Japanese mathematician and politician and served as the mayor of the city of Hiroshima, Japan from 1999 to 2011.

== Early life ==
He studied mathematics at the University of Tokyo, receiving a B.S. in 1966 and an M.S. in 1968. He continued his studies under John Milnor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning his PhD in mathematics in 1970. He took teaching jobs at a series of universities: State University of New York at Stony Brook (1970), Tufts University (1972–1986), and Hiroshima Shudo University (1986–1997). His research was on topology, with an interest in homotopy groups.

While at Tufts, Akiba established the &quot;Hibakusha Travel Grant&quot; program, which brought several American print and broadcast journalists annually to Hiroshima in August, to craft stories about the city (and typically about the experiences of those exposed to the atomic bomb in 1945).

==Political career==
As a member of the Social Democratic Party, he was elected to the House of Representatives, and served from 1990 to 1999. He assumed office as mayor of Hiroshima in February, 1999, and was reelected to this position in 2003 and in April 2007.

==Peace activities==

As mayor, he has been a visible peace activist. He is active in the Mayors for Peace organization, serving as the president of their World Conference. The 2020 Vision Campaign launched in 2003, which aims to eliminate nuclear weapons, has earned Mayors for Peace the &quot;World Citizenship Award&quot; from the Nuclear Age Peace Foundation in 2004, the &quot;Sean McBride&quot; Award from the International Peace Bureau in 2006, and the Nuclear-Free Future Award from the Franz-Moll Foundation in 2007. He has also been an advocate of the abolition of nuclear weapons, and a vocal critic of George W. Bush. Since May 2007 he is also Councillor at the World Future Council.

In 2007 he received the Nuclear-Free Future Award in the solutions category.

He was longlisted for the 2008 World Mayor award, but failed to win, as the award went to Mayor Helen Zille of Cape Town, Republic of South Africa.

On January 21, 2010, he attended the 78th winter meeting of the U.S. Conference of Mayors as a special guest speaker, and in that capacity attended the reception held at the White House and met US President Barack Obama. He is so far the only serving Mayor of Hiroshima who has officially met a serving US president.

In August 2010, he received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his advocacy for nuclear disarmament, and in April 2013 he was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal from the United Nations Association of Germany (DGVN) and the Governing Mayor of Berlin.

Akiba is on the Board of Advisors of the Global Security Institute.

Hiroshima is one place outside the United States where Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed with equal importance as in the United States. Tadatoshi Akiba holds a special banquet at the mayor&#x27;s office as an act of unifying his city&#x27;s call for peace with King&#x27;s message of human rights.

In August 2022, he was awarded the Ahmadiyya Muslim Prize for the Advancement of Peace.

==Stepping down as mayor==
In the new year address on January 4, 2011, Akiba announced he would not run for reelection during the mayoral election scheduled for April 10, 2011. No reasons were given. In early April it was reported that Hiroshima University has appointed Akiba as special professor, effective from his retirement as mayor. On April 10, Kazumi Matsui was elected the new Mayor. On August 3, 2012, he was appointed chairman of the Middle Powers Initiative (MPI), an international network of non-governmental organizations working for nuclear disarmament.

Neri was a High School student at Escuela Nacional Preparatoria 2. Neri received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical and electrical engineering, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) 1975, and received a master&#x27;s degree in science, specialized in telecommunications systems, in 1976 from the University of Essex, England. Neri then received a doctorate degree in electromagnetic radiation from the University of Birmingham in 1979 and performed one year of postdoctoral research in waveguides at the University of Birmingham.

==Career==
Neri has worked in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, United States; The Institution of Electrical Engineers, UK; Asociación Mexicana de Ingenieros en Comunicaciones Eléctricas y Electrónicas, Mexico; and Colegio de Ingenieros Mecánicos y Electricistas, Mexico.

Neri has also worked as an Institute of Electrical Research, Mexico, in the Radio communications Group, doing research and system planning on antenna theory and design, satellite communications systems, and Earth station technology.

He is currently also a full-time researcher at the Electric Engineering department of the Faculty of Engineering at UNAM.

In 2016, he had a participation in the Latin American dubbing of the film Finding Dory as the narrator of the recording of the Institute of Marine Life.

==Spaceflight==
Neri was a Payload Specialist aboard the STS-61-B Atlantis mission, from (November 26 to December 3, 1985). STS-61B launched at night from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the mission the crew deployed the MORELOS-B, AUSSATT II, and SATCOM K-2 communications satellites, conducted two six-hour spacewalks to demonstrate space station construction techniques with the EASE/ACCESS experiments, operated the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis (CRFES) experiment for McDonnell Douglas and a Getaway Special (GAS) container for Telesat, Canada, conducted several Mexican Payload Specialists Experiments for the Mexican government, and tested the Orbiter Experiments Digital Autopilot (OEX DAP).

At mission conclusion, Neri had traveled 2.4 million miles (3.8 million km) in 108 Earth orbits, and logged over 165 hours in space.

Neri requested tortillas in his food supply on the flight. Subsequently, NASA began including tortillas on shuttle and ISS missions, since tortillas, unlike regular bread, didn’t create crumbs and could be used to make sandwiches or hold other food items. Since then, tortillas have been a favorite of astronauts and are standard fare aboard ISS. Crewmembers use them to make breakfast burritos, hamburgers, and even peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

Goldwater Education Award; &quot;Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology&quot; Laureate (Space and Missiles). He was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in May 2008.

==Experience==
O&#x27;Connor began active duty with the United States Marine Corps in June 1968 following graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. He received his Naval Aviator wings in June 1970, and served as an attack pilot flying the A-4 Skyhawk and the AV-8A Harrier on land and sea assignments in the United States, Europe and the Western Pacific.

O&#x27;Connor attended the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 1975 and served as a test pilot with the Naval Air Test Center&#x27;s Strike Test Directorate at Patuxent River, Maryland. During this 3½ year assignment, he participated in evaluations of various conventional and VSTOL aircraft, including the A-4, OV-10, AV-8, and X-22 VSTOL research aircraft. From June 1977 to June 1979 he was the Naval Air Test Center project officer in charge of all Harrier flight testing, including the planning and execution of the First Navy Preliminary Evaluation of the YAV-8B advanced Harrier prototype. When informed of his selection to NASA&#x27;s Astronaut Program in 1980, he was serving as the Deputy Program Manager (Acquisition) for the AV-8 program at the Naval Air Systems Command in Washington, D.C.

==NASA experience==

O&#x27;Connor was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. After a one-year initial training program at NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, O&#x27;Connor served in a variety of functions in support of the first test flights of the Space Shuttle, including simulator test pilot for STS-1 and STS-2, safety/photo chase pilot for STS-3, and support crew for STS-4. He was CAPCOM (spacecraft communicator) for STS-5 through STS-9. He also served as Aviation Safety Officer for the NASA Astronaut Corps.

When the &quot;Challenger&quot; and its crew were lost in January 1986, O&#x27;Connor was given a number of safety and management assignments over the next three years as the Space Agency recovered from the disaster. In the first days after the accident, he organized the initial wreckage reassembly activities at Cape Canaveral. Then he established and managed the operation of the NASA Headquarters Action Center, the link between NASA and the Presidential Blue Ribbon Accident Investigation Panel (The Rogers Commission). In March 1986 he was assigned duties as Assistant (Operations) to the Space Shuttle Program Manager, as well as first Chairman of NASA&#x27;s new Space Flight Safety Panel: jobs he held until February 1988 and 1989 respectively. He subsequently served as Deputy Director of Flight Crew Operations from February 1988 until August 1991.

O&#x27;Connor has flown over 5,000 hours in over 40 types of aircraft. A veteran of two space flights, he has over 386 hours in space, covering five and three quarter million miles in 253 orbits of the Earth. O&#x27;Connor was pilot on STS-61-B in 1985 and was crew commander on STS-40 in 1991.

O&#x27;Connor left NASA in August 1991 to become commanding officer of the Marine Aviation Detachment, Naval Air Test Center, Patuxent River. During this 10-month assignment, he led 110 test pilots and technicians, participated as an AV-8B project test pilot, instructed students at the Test Pilot School, directed the Naval Air Test Center Museum, and became the first Marine to serve as Deputy Director and Chief of Staff of the Flight Test and Engineering Group.

O&#x27;Connor returned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, retiring from the Marine Corps to become the Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight. He was immediately assigned the task of developing a comprehensive flight safety improvement plan for the Space Shuttle, working closely with Congress and the Administration for funding of the major upgrade program. Then in late summer 1992, he was assigned as leader of the negotiating team that traveled to Moscow to establish the framework for what subsequently became the ambitious and complex joint crewed space program known as Shuttle/MIR.

In March 1993 O&#x27;Connor was assigned as Director, Space Station Redesign. He and his 50-person team of engineers, managers, and international partners developed, then recommended substantial vehicle and program restructure strategies which amounted to $300 million in savings per year, thus helping to save the program from cancellation by Congress. In September, he was named Acting Space Station Program Director. He held that position throughout the transition from the Freedom Program to the new International Space Station Program and the announcement of a permanent Program Director in January 1994.

In April 1994, O&#x27;Connor was reassigned as Director, Space Shuttle Program. As such, he was responsible for all aspects of the $3.5 billion per year program, leading over 27,000 government and contractor personnel. By the time he left NASA in March 1996, he had directed NASA&#x27;s largest and most visible program through twelve safe, successful missions, including the first three flights to the Russian Space Station, Mir. He planned and led an extensive program restructure designed to save the taxpayers approximately $1 billion over the five-year budget horizon. Of equal importance, he oversaw the introduction of several major safety improvements developed to prevent another &quot;Challenger disaster&quot;.

O&#x27;Connor left NASA in February 1996 to become an aerospace consultant. He also served on the Advisory Board of Airship Resources Corporation, a startup company planning to introduce high technology night sign display systems to the next generation large airships then under development in the United Kingdom. Until 2002, when he rejoined NASA as Chief of Safety and Mission Assurance, He served as Director of Engineering for Futron Corporation, a Bethesda, Maryland based company providing risk management and aerospace safety and dependability services to government and commercial organizations including the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Defense, NASA, Department of Energy, Westinghouse, AlliedSignal and others.

O&#x27;Connor served as NASA Chief of Safety and Mission Assurance until August 31, 2011, retiring from the agency.

==Spaceflight experience==
STS-61-B &quot;Atlantis&quot; (November 26, to December 3, 1985). STS-61-B was the 22nd Shuttle flight and was the second-ever night shuttle launch from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. It was the heaviest payload weight carried to orbit by the Space Shuttle to date, and the first flight to deploy four satellites. The mission included the EASE/ACCESS experiment. After completing 108 orbits of Earth in 165 hours, &quot;Atlantis&quot; returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. 

STS-40 &quot;Columbia&quot; (June 5–14, 1991). STS-40 was the first Space Shuttle mission dedicated to life science studies. During the 9-day mission the crew performed an extensive series of biomedical experiments. After 145 orbits of the Earth traveling 3.29 million miles in 218 hours, O&#x27;Connor piloted &quot;Columbia&quot; to a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, his crew having safely and successfully completed over 100% of their mission objectives.

<doc id="623946" wikidata="Q49269" url="?curid=623946" title="Ellen Ochoa">
<text>Ellen Ochoa (born May 10, 1958) is an American engineer, former astronaut and former director of the Johnson Space Center. In 1993, Ochoa became the first Latina woman to go to space when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. Ochoa became director of the center upon the retirement of the previous director, Michael Coats, on December 31, 2012. She was the first Latina director and the second female director of Johnson Space Center.

== Early life and education ==
Ellen Lauri Ochoa was born on May 10, 1958, in Los Angeles, California, to Joseph and Rosanne (née Deardorff) Ochoa. Her paternal grandparents emigrated from Sonora, Mexico, to Arizona and later to California where her father was born. She grew up in La Mesa, California. Ochoa was the middle child of five and neither parent had college degrees.

Ochoa graduated from Grossmont High School in El Cajon in 1975. Her parents divorced when she was in high school and she lived with her mother and her brothers.

Ochoa received a Bachelor of Science degree in physics from San Diego State University and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1980, before earning a Master of Science degree and a doctorate from Stanford Department of Electrical Engineering in 1981 and 1985, respectively. During her time at San Diego State University she found that she loved physics, math, and engineering; ultimately, deciding to major in physics and electrical engineering from Stanford.

== Career ==
=== Research ===
As a doctoral student at Stanford, and later as a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories and the NASA Ames Research Center, Ochoa investigated optical systems for performing information processing. At the NASA Ames Research Center, she led a research group working primarily on optical systems for automated space exploration. At Sandia National Laboratories, she applied what she knew about optics to the research being done on nuclear weapons. She had three patents for her work in optical systems. The first patent was for an optical inspection system that was designed to detect defects in repeating patterns. This was beneficial to analyze impurities in materials such as semiconductors to help with quality control. Her second patent was for an automated inspection system. This system was also designed to analyze manufactured components for imperfections or defects. Her third patent was for a method and apparatus designed to recognize texture patterns from photos. 

Ochoa was enticed by optical systems and committed to improving its applications for performing information processing. She wanted to help computers &quot;see&quot;. NASA later recognized her methods in optics could be used in fabricating such as inspecting for flaws, or it might be used on a space vehicle such as the Rover.

As Chief of the Intelligent Systems Technology Branch at Ames, she supervised 35 engineers and scientists in the research and development of computational systems for aerospace missions. Ochoa has presented numerous papers at technical conferences.

She was selected as part of the 1990 class of astronauts.

Ellen Ochoa was selected by NASA in January 1990 and became an astronaut in July 1991. Her technical assignments in the Astronaut Office included serving as the crew representative for flight software, computer hardware and robotics, Assistant for Space Station to the Chief of the Astronaut Office, lead spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in Mission Control and acting as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office.

Ochoa became the first Hispanic woman to go to space when she served on a nine-day mission aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; in 1993. The purpose of the Shuttle mission was to study the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer. A veteran of four space flights, Ochoa has logged nearly 1000 hours in space. She was a mission specialist on STS-56 (1993), was payload commander on STS-66, and was mission specialist and flight engineer on STS-96 and STS-110 in 2002. Her third trip was for the STS-96 mission, which was a significant trip as it marked the first docking of a space shuttle with the International Space Station. On this mission, the crew delivered supplies, equipment, and performed a few experiments with the ISS. Dr. Ochoa&#x27;s last trip was for the STS-110 mission, which was focused on the assembly of the ISS. Ochoa was in Mission Control during the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster and was one of the first personnel informed of television coverage showing &quot;Columbia&quot;″s disintegration.

From 2007, after retiring from spacecraft operations, Ochoa served as deputy director of NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center, helping to manage and direct the Astronaut Office and Aircraft Operations. On January 1, 2013, Ochoa became the first Hispanic and second female director of the Johnson Space Center. In November 2024, it was announced that she joined the board of Nvidia.

== National service ==
Ochoa was named vice chair of the National Science Board for the 2018–2020 term. She currently chairs the committee evaluating nominations for the National Medal of Technology and Innovation.

== Personal life ==
Ochoa&#x27;s husband is Coe Miles, an intellectual property attorney. They have two sons. Ochoa is a classical flutist and played with the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, once receiving the Student Soloist Award. While an undergraduate at San Diego State University, she played the flute for two years as part of the university marching band and for five years as a member of the university wind ensemble. She took a flute with her on her first mission to space.

==Recognition==

The Ochoa Middle School located in Pasco, Washington, the Ellen Ochoa Elementary School in Cudahy, California, and the Ánimo Ellen Ochoa Charter Middle School in East Los Angeles are named in her honor. In addition, Grand Prairie, Texas has the Ellen Ochoa STEM Academy at Ben Milam Elementary School and Pico Rivera, California has the Ellen Ochoa Prep Academy. Union Public Schools in Tulsa named a new elementary school after her as well, as did the school system in Passaic, New Jersey.

A flag with the rocket logo of the Ochoa Middle School in Pasco, Washington, flew with Ochoa in April 2002 aboard the Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; for an 11-day mission to the International Space Station. Ochoa returned the flag to the school when she visited as a special guest at the 2002 dedication and it remains on permanent display.

Ochoa has received many awards among which are NASA&#x27;s Distinguished Service Medal (2015), Exceptional Service Medal (1997), Outstanding Leadership Medal (1995) and Space Flight Medals (2002, 1999, 1994, 1993). Ochoa and Michael Foale were announced as the 2017 class of the United States Astronaut Hall of Fame. Ochoa was recognized in &quot;Hispanic Executive&quot;&#x27;s 2017 Best of the Boardroom issue for her work as a board director for Johnson Space Center. She was inducted into the 2018 International Air and Space Hall of Fame class.

Ochoa is a Fellow of American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the National Academy of Inventors, and Optica.

An animated version of Ochoa was featured in the 2019 episode &quot;Astronaut Ellen Ochoa&quot; of the children&#x27;s television program, &quot;Ready Jet Go!&quot;. In 2024, Ochoa was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden.

<text>Mary Hayward Weir, born Mary Emma Hayward (1915–1968), was an American steel heiress and socialite. She was the wealthy widow of Pittsburgh steel king Ernest T. Weir, and the former wife of Polish author Jerzy Kosiński. The Mary H. Weir Public Library in Weirton, West Virginia is named after her.

==Personal life==
Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, she was working as a secretary for the National Steel Corporation in 1941 when she met and later married her boss, chairman and CEO Ernest T. Weir. She divorced her first husband, Donald Reeve, to marry Weir. Ernest was 40 years her senior and was recently divorced with two grown sons roughly Mary&#x27;s age.

Mary Hayward and Ernest T. Weir were married on December 11, 1941, and together had one son, David Weir, born in 1944. She was widowed in 1957 when her husband died at the age of 81.

On January 11, 1962, she married the Polish author Jerzy Kosiński after a romance of 18 months. Kosiński had emigrated from Poland in December 1957 to the United States. 

Weir and Kosiński met in the summer of 1960 in New York City when the heiress hired the young Kosiński to catalog her private library. Weir was a close friend of coffee heiress Abigail Folger of the Folgers Coffee family, and it was through her husband Jerzy Kosiński that Folger met her future boyfriend Wojciech Frykowski (Folger and Frykowski were murdered in 1969 by the Manson Family). In 1966, Weir divorced Kosiński. 

Weir was known for her never-ending volunteer work in many different areas as well as her extensive travels around the world. She was known to have battled many serious bouts of depression beginning as far back as 1950, and at times, suffered from blackouts as a result of this. She also struggled with alcoholism for years.

==Cultural references==
On June 2, 1958, in Weirton, West Virginia, the Mary H. Weir Public Library was named in her honor with Weir&#x27;s cutting the ribbon in person.

In 1965, Kosiński dedicated his novel &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; to her. Around this time, the illness which would ultimately claim her life began to show symptoms. Kosiński wrote a roman à clef about his marriage to Weir in 1977 in the novel &quot;Blind Date&quot;, referring to her as &quot;Mary–Jane Kirkland&quot;.

==Death==
Mary Hayward Weir was diagnosed with a brain tumour, of which she died on August 1, 1968, aged 52 or 53. She left Kosiński nothing in her will.

<doc id="623959" wikidata="Q708489" url="?curid=623959" title="Yury Onufriyenko">
<text>Col. Yuri Ivanovich Onufrienko (, ; born 6 February 1961) is a retired Russian cosmonaut. He is a veteran of two extended spaceflights, aboard the space station Mir in 1996 and aboard the International Space Station in 2001–2002.

== Personal ==
Onufrienko was born in Ryasne, Zolochiv Raion of Kharkiv Oblast, Soviet Union (now Ukraine). Onufrienko and his wife, Valentina Mikhailovna Onufrienko, have two sons, Yuri, born in 1982 and Aleksandr, born in 1990 and one daughter, Elena, born in 1988. He has two older brothers and his parents are deceased. Onufrienko enjoys tennis, cooking, fishing, chess, and aviation.

== Education ==
Onufrienko graduated from the V.M. Komarov Eisk Higher Military Aviation School for Pilots in 1982 with a pilot-engineer&#x27;s diploma. In 1994, Onufrienko earned a degree in cartography from Moscow State University.

== Awards ==
Onufrienko was awarded the Hero of Russia medal, the title of Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation, the Gold Star Medal of the Hero of the Russian Federation and NASA Space Flight and Public Service Medals. In 1997 he was named a Chevalier in the French Legion of Honor.

== Experience ==
Onufrienko served as a pilot in the Soviet (later Russian) Air Force, where he logged over 800 flight hours. He has flown the L-29, Sukhoi Su-7, Sukhoi Su-17 (M1-4), and L-39.

== Cosmonaut career ==

Onufrienko was selected as a cosmonaut candidate in 1989. From September 1989 to January 1991, he underwent a course of general space training. Starting April 1991, he underwent training as a member of test cosmonauts group. Starting March 1994, he entered flight training to be the commander of the stand-by crew of the Mir-18 expedition aboard the Soyuz TM-21 spacecraft and the Mir space station as part of the Shuttle-Mir program.

=== Mir EO-21 ===
From February 21 to September 2, 1996, Onufrienko served as commander of the Mir EO-21 expedition. The Soyuz TM-23 spacecraft carrying Onufrienko with cosmonaut Yury Usachov lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on February 21, 1996, at 12:34:05 UTC. After two days of autonomous flight, the Soyuz spacecraft docked with the Mir space station&#x27;s forward-facing port on February 23 at 14:20 UTC. One month later, he and Yuri Usachov were joined by NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid. During Mir-21 Onufrienko performed numerous research experiments including Protein crystal growth experiments experiments in materials science using high temperature melting oven &quot;Optizon&quot;. The new module &quot;Priroda&quot;, the seventh and final module of the Mir Space Station arrived on April 26, 1996. Its primary purpose was to conduct Earth resource experiments through remote sensing and to develop and verify remote sensing methods. During Mir EO-21 supplies arrived with the Progress M-31 spacecraft. Onufrienko and Yuri Usachov were joined by French astronaut Claudie André-Deshays after the departure of Shannon Lucid.

On September 2, 1996, Onufrienko, Usachev and Claudie André-Deshays returned to Earth on board the Soyuz TM-23 capsule. The spacecraft landed at 07:41:40 UTC 108 km south west of Akmola (Tselinograd). Altogether, on board Soyuz TM-23 and Mir, Onufrienko logged 193 days in space.

=== Expedition 4 ===

Onufrienko again served as commander on ISS Expedition 4. Onufrienko returned to space on board STS-108 mission. Launched on December 5, 2001, at 22:19:28 UTC from the Kennedy Space Center, &quot;Endeavour&quot; docked with the International Space Station (ISS) on December 7, 2001, at 20:03 UTC. The primary objective of STS-108 was to deliver supplies to and help maintain the ISS. During a -month stay aboard the ISS, the 3 member Expedition 4 crew (Onufrienko and NASA astronauts Daniel W. Bursch and Carl E. Walz) performed flight tests of the station hardware, conducted internal and external maintenance tasks, and developed the capability of the station to support the addition of science experiments. The Expedition 4 crew returned to Earth aboard STS-111, with &quot;Endeavour&quot; landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on June 19, 2002. In completing this mission, Onufrienko logged an additional 196 days in space, for a total of 389 days of spaceflight.

=== Spacewalks ===
Onufrienko has performed eight career spacewalks totaling 42 hours and 33 minutes. As of June 2010, he has secured the 11th position in the list of astronauts who have the most spacewalk time. Onufrienko performed six spacewalks during his stay on board the Mir Space Station and performed another two during his visit to the ISS.

Onufrienko performed his first career spacewalk on 15 March 1996. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 01:04 UTC. They installed the second Strela boom and prepared for Mir Cooperative Solar Array (MCSA) installation. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 51 minutes.

On 20 May 1996 Onufrienko performed his second career spacewalk. The spacewalk started at 22:50 UTC and ended at 04:10 UTC clocking 5 hours and 20 minutes. During the spacewalk, the two cosmonauts removed the Mir cooperative solar array (MCSA) from its stowed position on the exterior of the docking module at the base of the Kristall module. They used the Strela boom to reach and move the array to the &quot;Kvant-1&quot; module. The two spacewalkers also inflated an aluminum and nylon pup-up model of a Pepsi Cola can, which they then filmed against the backdrop of Earth. The Pepsi Cola company paid for the procedure and planned to use the film in a television commercial. However, the commercial never aired—reportedly because Pepsi later changed the design of the can.

Onufrienko performed his third career spacewalk on 24 May 1996. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 22:50 UTC. They installed the MCSA on the &quot;Kvant-1&quot; module. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 34 minutes.

On 30 May 1996, Onufrienko ventured outside the Mir Space Station to conduct his fourth career spacewalk. He and cosmonaut Usachov started the spacewalk at 18:20 UTC. They installed the modular optoelectrical multispectral scanner (MOMS) outside &quot;Priroda&quot; and handrails on the &quot;Kvant-2&quot; module to facilitate moving around outside the station during future extravehicular activities. MOMS was used to study the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and environment. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes.

On 6 June 1996, Onufrienko performed his fifth career spacewalk. He and Usachov installed micrometeoroid detectors and replaced cassettes in the Swiss/Russian Komza experiment and installed the Particle Impact Experiment, the Mir Sample Return Experiment, and the SKK-11 cassette, which exposed construction materials to space conditions. The spacewalk lasted 3 hours and 34 minutes.

Onufrienko performed his sixth career spacewalk on 13 June 1996. The spacewalk started at 12:45 UTC and ended at 18:27 UTC clocking 5 hours and 42 minutes. During the spacewalk, Onufrienko and Usachov installed the Rapana truss structure (an experiment mounting point) to the Kvant-1 module. Onufrienko and Usachev also manually deployed the saddle-shaped traverse synthetic aperture radar antenna on Priroda. The large antenna had failed to open fully after receiving commands from inside Mir.

Onufrienko performed his seventh career spacewalk on January 14, 2002. The space walk was based out of the &quot;Pirs&quot; Airlock and used Russian Orlan space suits. Onufrienko and NASA astronaut Carl Walz relocated the cargo boom for the Russian Strela crane. They moved the boom from Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA 1) to the exterior of the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment. The crew also installed an amateur radio antenna onto the end of the Zvezda Service Module. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 3 minutes.

Onufrienko performed his eighth career spacewalk on January 25, 2002, when he and NASA astronaut Daniel Bursch ventured out into space from the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock. During the spacewalk, Onufrienko and Bursch installed six deflector shields for the Zvezda Service Module&#x27;s jet thrusters. Also, they installed an amateur radio antenna. 
The two spacewalkers also removed an experiment called Kromka situated near one of the thruster groups and installed a virtually identical new Kromka experiment in the same place. The experiment captured material that results from thruster firings. Onufrienko and Bursch also attached a physics experiment called Platan to the Zvezda module. Platan was designed to capture low-energy heavy nuclei from the sun and from outside the solar system. In addition, they installed three materials experiments, called SKK for their Russian acronym, on the Zvezda module. The experiments examine effects of the harsh environment of space on a wide range of materials. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 59 minutes.

<doc id="623960" wikidata="Q3880836" url="?curid=623960" title="Ode to the West Wind">
<text>&quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot; is an ode, written by Percy Bysshe Shelley in 1819 in arno wood near Florence, Italy. It was originally published in 1820 by Charles Ollier in London as part of the collection &quot;Prometheus Unbound, A Lyrical Drama in Four Acts, With Other Poems&quot;. Perhaps more than anything else, Shelley wanted his message of reform and revolution spread, and the wind becomes the trope for spreading the word of change through the poet-prophet figure. Some also believe that the poem was written in response to the loss of his son, William (born to Mary Shelley) in 1819. The ensuing pain influenced Shelley. The poem allegorises the role of the poet as the voice of change and revolution. At the time of composing this poem, Shelley without doubt had the Peterloo Massacre of August 1819 in mind. His other poems written at the same time—&quot;The Masque of Anarchy&quot;, &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;, and &quot;England in 1819&quot;—take up these same themes of political change, revolution, and role of the poet.

== Genre ==
In ancient Greek tradition, an ode was considered a form of formal public invocation. It was usually a poem with a complex structure and was chanted or sung on important religious or state ceremonies. According to Harold Bloom, &quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot; reflects two types of ode traditions: odes written by Pindar and the Horatian ode. The odes of Pindar were exalted in tone and celebrated human accomplishments, whereas the Horatian odes were personal and contemplative rather than public. Shelley combines the two elements in this poem. In the English tradition, the ode was more of a &quot;vehicle for expressing the sublime, lofty thoughts of intellectual and spiritual concerns&quot;. This purpose is also reflected in Shelley&#x27;s ode.

== Structure ==
&quot;Ode to the West Wind&quot; consists of five sections (cantos) written in terza rima. Each section consists of four tercets (ABA, BCB, CDC, DED) and a rhyming couplet (EE). The ode is written in iambic pentameter.

The poem begins with three sections describing the wind&#x27;s effects upon earth, air, and ocean. In the last two sections, the poet speaks directly to the wind, asking for its power, to lift him up and make him its companion in its wanderings. The poem ends with an optimistic note which is that if winter days are here then spring is not very far.

== Interpretation of the poem ==

The poem can be divided in two parts: the first three cantos are about the qualities of the Wind and each ends with the invocation &quot;Oh hear!&quot; The last two cantos give a relation between the Wind and the speaker. Each canto of the poem has its own theme which connects to the central idea.

=== First Canto ===
The first stanza begins with the alliteration &quot;wild West Wind&quot; (line 1). The form of the apostrophe makes the wind also a personification. However, one must not think of this ode as an optimistic praise of the wind; it is clearly associated with autumn. The first few lines contain personification elements, such as &quot;leaves dead&quot; (2), the aspect of death being highlighted by the inversion which puts &quot;dead&quot; (2) at the end of the line. These leaves haunt as &quot;ghosts&quot; (3) that flee from something that panics them.

&quot;chariotest&quot; (6) is the second person singular. The &quot;corpse within its grave&quot; (8) in the next line is in contrast to the &quot;azure sister of the Spring&quot; (9)—a reference to the east wind—whose &quot;living hues and odours&quot; (12) evoke a strong contrast to the colours of the fourth line of the poem that evoke death. In the last line of this canto the west wind is considered the &quot;Destroyer&quot; (14) because it drives the last signs of life from the trees, and the &quot;Preserver&quot; (14) for scattering the seeds which will come to life in the spring,

=== Second Canto ===

The second canto discusses the wind&#x27;s effect on the air. The sky&#x27;s &quot;clouds&quot;(16) are &quot;like earth&#x27;s decaying leaves&quot; (16). This is a reference to the second line of the first canto (&quot;leaves dead&quot;, 2). The clouds also are numerous in number like the dead leaves. Through this reference the landscape is recalled again. The &quot;clouds&quot; (16) are &quot;Shook from the tangled boughs of Heaven and Ocean&quot; (17). This probably refers to the fact that the line between the sky and the stormy sea is indistinguishable and the whole space from the horizon to the zenith is covered with trailing storm clouds. The &quot;clouds&quot; can also be seen as &quot;Angels of rain&quot; (18). In a biblical way, they may be messengers that bring a message from heaven down to earth through rain and lightning. These two natural phenomena with their &quot;fertilizing and illuminating power&quot; bring a change.

Line 21 begins with &quot;Of some fierce Maenad&quot; and again the west wind is part of the second canto of the poem; here he is two things at once: first he is &quot;dirge/Of the dying year&quot; (23–24) and second he is &quot;a prophet of tumult whose prediction is decisive&quot;; a prophet who does not only bring &quot;black rain, and fire, and hail&quot; (28), but who &quot;will burst&quot; (28) it. The &quot;locks of the approaching storm&quot; (23) are the messengers of this bursting: the &quot;clouds&quot;.

Shelley also mentions that when the West Wind blows, it seems to be singing a funeral song about the year coming to an end and that the sky covered with a dome of clouds looks like a &quot;sepulchre&quot;, i.e., a burial chamber or grave for the dying year or the year which is coming to an end.

Shelley in this canto &quot;expands his vision from the earthly scene with the leaves before him to take in the vaster commotion of the skies&quot;. This means that the wind is now no longer at the horizon and therefore far away, but he is exactly above us. The clouds now reflect the image of the swirling leaves; this is a parallelism that gives evidence that we lifted &quot;our attention from the finite world into the macrocosm&quot;. The &quot;clouds&quot; can also be compared with the leaves; but the clouds are more unstable and bigger than the leaves and they can be seen as messengers of rain and lightning as it was mentioned above.

=== Third Canto ===

This refers to the effect of west wind in the water. The question that comes up when reading the third canto at first is what the subject of the verb &quot;saw&quot; (33) could be. On the one hand there is the &quot;blue Mediterranean&quot; (30). With the &quot;Mediterranean&quot; as subject of the canto, the &quot;syntactical movement&quot; is continued and there is no break in the fluency of the poem; it is said that &quot;he lay, / Lull&#x27;d by the coil of his crystalline streams, / Beside a pumice isle in Baiae&#x27;s bay, / And saw in sleep old palaces and towers&quot; (30–33). On the other hand, it is also possible that the lines of this canto refer to the &quot;wind&quot; again. Then the verb that belongs to the &quot;wind&quot; as subject is not &quot;lay&quot;, but the previous line of this canto, that says Thou who didst waken ... And saw&quot; (29, 33). But whoever—the &quot;Mediterranean&quot; or the &quot;wind&quot;—&quot;saw&quot; (33) the question remains whether the city one of them saw, is real and therefore a reflection on the water of a city that really exists on the coast; or the city is just an illusion. Pirie is not sure of that either. He says that it might be &quot;a creative you interpretation of the billowing seaweed; or of the glimmering sky reflected on the heaving surface&quot;. Both possibilities seem to be logical. To explain the appearance of an underwater world, it might be easier to explain it by something that is realistic; and that might be that the wind is able to produce illusions on the water. With its pressure, the wind &quot;would waken the appearance of a city&quot;. From what is known of the &quot;wind&quot; from the last two cantos, it became clear that the wind is something that plays the role of a Creator. Whether the wind creates real things or illusions does not seem to be that important.
Baiae&#x27;s bay (at the northern end of the Gulf of Naples) actually contains visible Roman ruins underwater (that have been shifted due to earthquakes.) Obviously the moss and flowers are seaweed.
It appears as if the third canto shows—in comparison with the previous cantos—a turning-point. Whereas Shelley had accepted death and changes in life in the first and second canto, he now turns to &quot;wistful reminiscence [, recalls] an alternative possibility of transcendence&quot;. From line 26 to line 36 he gives an image of nature. But if we look closer at line 36, we realise that the sentence is not what it appears to be at first sight, because it obviously means, so sweet that one feels faint in describing them. This shows that the idyllic picture is not what it seems to be and that the harmony will certainly soon be destroyed. A few lines later, Shelley suddenly talks about &quot;fear&quot; (41). This again shows the influence of the west wind which announces the change of the season.

=== Fourth Canto ===
Whereas the cantos one to three began with &quot;O wild West Wind&quot; and &quot;Thou&quot; (15, 29) and were clearly directed to the wind, there is a change in the fourth canto. The focus is no more on the &quot;wind&quot;, but on the speaker who says &quot;If I ...&quot; (43–44). Until this part, the poem has appeared very anonymous and was only concentrated on the wind and its forces so that the author of the poem was more or less forgotten. Pirie calls this &quot;the suppression of personality&quot; which finally vanishes at that part of the poem. It becomes more and more clear that what the author talks about now is himself. That this must be true, shows the frequency of the author&#x27;s use of the first-person pronouns &quot;I&quot; (43–44, 48, 51, 54), &quot;my&quot; (48, 52), and &quot;me&quot; (53). These pronouns appear nine times in the fourth canto. Certainly the author wants to dramatise the atmosphere so that the reader recalls the situation of canto one to three. He achieves this by using the same pictures of the previous cantos in this one. Whereas these pictures, such as &quot;leaf&quot;, &quot;cloud&quot;, and &quot;wave&quot; have existed only together with the wind, they are now existing with the author. The author thinks about being one of them and says &quot;If I were a . . .&quot; (43 ff.). Shelley here identifies himself with the wind, although he knows that he cannot do that, because it is impossible for someone to put all the things he has learned from life aside and enter a &quot;world of innocence&quot;. That Shelley is deeply aware of his closedness in life and his identity shows his command in line 53. There he says &quot;Oh, lift me up as a wave, a leaf, a cloud&quot; (53). He knows that this is something impossible to achieve, but he does not stop praying for it. The only chance Shelley sees to make his prayer and wish for a new identity with the Wind come true is by pain or death, as death leads to rebirth. So, he wants to &quot;fall upon the thorns of life&quot; and &quot;bleed&quot; (54).

At the end of the canto the poet tells us that &quot;a heavy weight of hours has chain&#x27;d and bow&#x27;d&quot; (55). This may be a reference to the years that have passed and &quot;chained and bowed&quot; (55) the hope of the people who fought for freedom and were literally imprisoned. With this knowledge, the West Wind becomes a different meaning. The wind is the &quot;uncontrollable&quot; (47) who is &quot;tameless&quot; (56). This canto also sounds like a kind of prayer or confession of the poet, yet does not address God. Shelley was a staunch atheist and one of the characteristics of Romanticism is equating nature with divinity, with the West Wind taking on the role of God.

Shelley also changes his use of metaphors in this canto. In the first cantos the wind was a metaphor explained at full length. Now the metaphors are only weakly presented—&quot;the thorns of life&quot; (54). Shelley also leaves out the fourth element: the fire. In the previous cantos he wrote about the earth, the air and the water. The reader now expects the fire—but it is not there. This leads to a break in the symmetry.

=== Fifth Canto ===
Again and again the wind is very important in this last canto. At the beginning of the poem the wind was only capable of blowing the leaves from the trees. In the previous canto the poet identified himself with the leaves. In this canto the wind is now capable of using both of these things mentioned before.

Everything that had been said before was part of the elements—wind, earth, and water. Now the fourth element comes in: the fire.

There is also a confrontation in this canto: Whereas in line 57 Shelley writes &quot;me thy&quot;, there is &quot;thou me&quot; in line 62. These pronouns appear seven times in the fifth canto. This &quot;signals a restored confidence, if not in the poet’s own abilities, at least in his capacity to communicate with [. . .] the Wind&quot;.

It is also necessary to mention that the first-person pronouns again appear in a great frequency; but the possessive pronoun &quot;my&quot; predominates. Unlike the frequent use of the &quot;I&quot; in the previous canto that made the canto sound self-conscious, this canto might now sound self-possessed. The canto is no more a request or a prayer as it had been in the fourth canto—it is a demand. The poet becomes the wind&#x27;s instrument, his &quot;lyre&quot; (57). This is a symbol of the poet&#x27;s own passivity towards the wind; he becomes his musician and the wind&#x27;s breath becomes his breath. The poet&#x27;s attitude—towards the wind has changed: in the first canto the wind has been an &quot;enchanter&quot; (3), now the wind has become an &quot;incantation&quot; (65).

And there is another contrast between the two last cantos: in the fourth canto the poet had articulated himself in singular: &quot;a leaf&quot; (43, 53), &quot;a cloud&quot; (44, 53), &quot;A wave&quot; (45, 53) and &quot;One too like thee&quot; (56). In this canto, the &quot;sense of personality as vulnerably individualised led to self-doubt&quot; and the greatest fear was that what was
&quot;tameless, and swift, and proud&quot; (56) will stay &quot;chain&#x27;d and bow&#x27;d&quot; (55). The last canto differs from that. The poet in this canto uses plural forms, for example, &quot;my leaves&quot; (58, 64), &quot;thy harmonies&quot; (59), &quot;my thoughts&quot; (63), &quot;ashes and sparks&quot; (67) and &quot;my lips&quot; (68). By the use of the plural, the poet is able to show that there is some kind of peace and pride in his words. It even seems as if he has redefined himself because the uncertainty of the previous canto has been blown away. The &quot;leaves&quot; merge with those of an entire forest and &quot;Will&quot; become components in a whole tumult of mighty harmonies. The use of this &quot;Will&quot; (60) is certainly a reference to the future. Through the future meaning, the poem itself does not only sound as something that might have happened in the past, but it may even be a kind of &quot;prophecy&quot; (69) for what might come—the future.

At last, Shelley again calls the Wind in a kind of prayer and even wants him to be &quot;his&quot; Spirit: &quot;My spirit! Be thou me, impetuous one!&quot; (62). Like the leaves of the trees in a forest, his leaves will fall and decay and will perhaps soon flourish again when the spring comes. That may be why he is looking forward to the spring and asks at the end of the last canto &quot;If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?&quot; (70). This is of course a rhetorical question because spring does come after winter, but the &quot;if&quot; suggests that it might not come if the rebirth is strong and extensive enough, and if it is not, another renewal—spring—will come anyway. Thus the question has a deeper meaning and does not only mean the change of seasons, but is a reference to death and rebirth as well. It also indicates that after the struggles and problems in life, there would always be a solution. It shows us the optimistic view of the poet about life which he would like the world to know. It is an interpretation of his saying, If you are suffering now, there will be good times ahead. But the most powerful call to the Wind are the lines: &quot;Drive my dead thoughts over the universe/like withered leaves to quicken a new birth!&quot; Here Shelley is imploring—or really chanting to—the Wind to blow away all of his useless thoughts so that he can be a vessel for the Wind and, as a result, awaken the Earth.

== Conclusion ==
This poem is a highly controlled text about the role of the poet as the agent of political and moral change. This was a subject Shelley wrote a great deal about, especially around 1819, with this strongest version of it articulated the last famous lines of his &quot;Defence of Poetry&quot;: &quot;Poets are the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration; the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present; the words which express what they understand not; the trumpets which sing to battle, and feel not what they inspire; the influence which is moved not, but moves. Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.&quot;

<text>Sphyrna is a genus of hammerhead sharks with a cosmopolitan distribution in the world&#x27;s oceans. Members of &quot;Sphyrna&quot; have a tendency to inhabit coastal waters along the intertidal zone rather than the open ocean, as their prey such as invertebrates, fish, rays, small crustaceans, and other benthic organisms hide in the sands and sediment along these zones. Members of &quot;Sphyrna&quot; are also known by synonyms such as &quot;Zygaena&quot;, &quot;Cestracion&quot;, and &quot;Sphyrichthys&quot;. The earliest species described of this genus was &quot;Sphyrna zygaena&quot; by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, while the latest described member, &quot;Sphyrna alleni&quot;, was described in 2024.

The genus name comes from the Greek word &quot;sphyra&quot; &quot;hammer&quot;, it is also where the family name Sphyrnidae comes from.

<text>The Ride of the Valkyries () is the popular name of the prelude to the first scene of the third and last act of &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, the second of the four epic music dramas that constitute the operatic cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (English: &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;), composed by Richard Wagner.
As a separate piece, the &quot;Ride&quot; is often heard in a purely instrumental version, which may be as short as three minutes. Together with the &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; from &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, the &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; is one of Wagner&#x27;s best-known pieces.

== Context ==

The main theme of the &quot;Ride&quot;, the leitmotif labelled , was first written down by the composer on 23 July 1851. The preliminary draft for the &quot;Ride&quot; was composed in 1854 as part of the composition of the entire opera, which was fully orchestrated by the end of March 1856.

In the &quot;Walküre&quot; opera, the &quot;Ride&quot;, which takes around eight minutes, begins in the prelude to the third act, building up successive layers of accompaniment until the curtain rises to reveal a mountain peak where four of the eight Valkyrie sisters of Brünnhilde have gathered in preparation for the transportation of fallen heroes to Valhalla. As they are joined by the other four, the familiar tune is carried by the orchestra, while, above it, the Valkyries greet each other and sing their battle-cry. Apart from the song of the Rhinemaidens in &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, it is the only ensemble piece in the first three operas of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle.

== Performance history ==
The complete opera &quot;Die Walküre&quot; was first performed on 26 June 1870 in the National Theatre Munich against the composer&#x27;s intent. By January of the next year, Wagner was receiving requests for the &quot;Ride&quot; to be performed separately, but wrote that such a performance should be considered &quot;an utter indiscretion&quot; and forbade &quot;any such thing&quot;. However, the piece was still printed and sold in Leipzig, and Wagner wrote a complaint to the publisher Schott. In the period up to the first performance of the complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, Wagner continued to receive requests for separate performances, his second wife Cosima noting &quot;Unsavoury letters arrive for R. – requests for the Ride of the Valkyries and I don&#x27;t know what else.&quot; Once the &quot;Ring&quot; had been performed in Bayreuth in 1876, Wagner lifted the embargo. He himself conducted it in London on 12 May 1877, repeating it as an encore.

== Outside opera ==

Uses in film include the original score for &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), and &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; (1957).

The &quot;Ride&quot; features as diegetic music in &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), where the 1/9 Air Cavalry squadron plays it on helicopter-mounted loudspeakers during their assault on a Viet Cong-controlled village as psychological warfare and to motivate their own troops.

Ride of the Valkyries is also featured in Maxell&#x27;s iconic &quot;Blown Away Guy&quot; cassette advertisement in the 1980s, showing a man sitting low in a chair and then a powerful wind blowing from speakers playing Ride of the Valkyries, showcasing the high quality of their cassettes.

During his run in World Wrestling Entertainment, wrestler Daniel Bryan used an altered version of Ride of the Valkyries as his theme song under a different name, “Flight of the Valkyries” which was produced by Jim Johnston and was released in 2011.
Ride of the Valkyries has been used as the tune for the official theme song of Mimosas and Pancakes, an annual Super Bowl Breakfast event in Anaheim California, since 2002.

<text>Ángel Serafín Seriche Dougan (born 1946) was Prime Minister of Equatorial Guinea from April 1, 1996, to March 4, 2001.

Beginning in 2000, Dougan&#x27;s government was subjected to serious criticism from the parliamentary majority with regard to allegations of corruption. This led to what was described as an &quot;institutional crisis&quot;, and Dougan resigned on February 23, 2001. President Teodoro Obiang Nguema appointed Cándido Muatetema Rivas to succeed him on February 26.

<text>The Fortunes are an English harmony beat group. Formed in Birmingham, the Fortunes first came to prominence and international acclaim in 1965, when &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Your Troubles&quot; broke into the US, Canadian, and UK Top 10s. Afterwards, they had a succession of hits including &quot;Here It Comes Again&quot; and &quot;Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again&quot;; continuing into the 1970s with more globally successful releases such as &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot; and &quot;Freedom Come, Freedom Go&quot;.

In 1966, their manager, Reginald Calvert, was shot dead in a dispute over pirate radio stations.

==Biography==
The Fortunes (Rod Allen, Glen Dale, Barry Pritchard as vocalists, Chris Capaldi as piano player, Gary Fletcher as drummer and Tony Britnell as saxophone player) were formed in 1961 and were resident at Clifton Hall in Rugby, Warwickshire where many 60s rockstars formed their career. The three vocalists had been the Merrie Men backing Robbie Hood (A.K.A Mike West, previously co-singer with Fred Heath in Johnny Kidd &amp; The Pirates). The Fortunes were originally backed by an instrumental group known as the Cliftones, and the band placed an instrumental track on a compilation album, &quot;Brumbeat&quot;, issued by the local Dial record label. &quot;Cygnet Twitch&quot; was a working of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and they subsequently signed to British Decca in 1963. Their first single, &quot;Summertime, Summertime&quot;, was credited to the Fortunes and the Cliftones. However, the vocalists picked up guitars, jettisoned the Cliftones, and added Andy Brown on drums, and David Carr on keyboards. The follow-up disc &quot;Caroline&quot;, co-written by the singer-songwriter and future Ivy League member Perry Ford and songwriter Tony Hiller, is still in use as the signature tune for the pirate radio station, Radio Caroline.

The group&#x27;s next two singles, Gordon Mills&#x27;s co-composition &quot;I Like the Look of You&quot; and a revival of &quot;Look Homeward Angel&quot; — like the initial brace of releases overseen by the American record producer Shel Talmy — also failed to chart. Their fifth release, the Roger Greenaway/Roger Cook number, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Your Troubles&quot; (1965), reached Number 2 in the UK Singles Chart and was a worldwide hit, including reaching Number 1 in Canada and the American Top 10. Their next two singles were &quot;Here It Comes Again&quot;, a UK Number 4, and &quot;This Golden Ring&quot; a UK Number 14. These sold well, but each less than the previous release. When Glen Dale left in the summer of 1966 he was replaced by Shel McCrae. Three more singles (&quot;You Gave Me Somebody to Love&quot;, &quot;Is It Really Worth Your While?&quot; and &quot;Our Love has Gone&quot;) all failed to chart.

At this point in 1967, the Fortunes left Decca for United Artists. They reunited with Talmy for their next release, &quot;The Idol&quot;, a song they had written themselves, and although it did get some airplay in the UK, it did not become a hit. Around this time they released a version of &#x27;Seasons in the Sun&#x27; which also failed to chart.

The Fortunes also recorded an advertisement for Coca-Cola in the United States. Their first recording in 1967 was a version of the theme tune, &quot;Things Go Better with Coke&quot;, but they are most remembered for introducing the 1969 new slogan recording, used as the main theme for Coca-Cola on both radio and television commercials — &quot;It&#x27;s The Real Thing&quot;.

In 1968, they tried covering The Move&#x27;s hit &quot;Fire Brigade&quot; for the US market, but with little airplay or sales. In 1970, they recorded an album for the US World Pacific record label, and then signed with Capitol in both the UK and US in 1971.

Then followed a steady succession of singles, some of which were hits outside of the UK and US. It was during this period they had worldwide hits with &quot;Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again&quot; and &quot;Freedom Come, Freedom Go&quot; in 1971, along with &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot; in 1972.

==Later work==
Founding member and lead vocalist Allen continued fronting an ever changing version of the Fortunes from 1963 up to his death in 2008.

In 1983 and 1984 respectively, Michael Smitham and Paul Hooper joined Barry Pritchard and Rod Allen in the Fortunes. This line up of the Fortunes were awarded a gold disc in 1987 for over 100,000 sales of their &quot;All The Hits and More&quot; album.

In 1991, Glen Dale, whilst living in Tenerife, reformed the group as Glen Dale&#x27;s Fortunes alongside Martin Cox (guitar) (who has gone on to be one of the world&#x27;s top Elton John tributes).

In March 1995, Bob Jackson was added to the Fortunes&#x27; ranks, after founder member Barry Pritchard left through illness. Jackson, a former member of the group Badfinger, paid homage to his former bandmate on stage, with a version of the Badfinger penned song &quot;Without You&quot;. Jackson left for a year to follow other obligations and Geoff Turton, who was originally a member of the Rockin&#x27; Berries, stood in for him. Barry Pritchard died from a heart attack on 11 January 1999 in Swindon, Wiltshire, UK.

On 10 January 2008, Rod Allen died after suffering for two months from liver cancer. The remaining members of the band said they would continue touring and recruited the Dakotas lead singer Eddie Mooney. During 2008, the band regrouped, recorded a new album &quot;Play On&quot;, and appeared in Las Vegas, the Netherlands and Belgium as well as the UK. They toured Canada, the Netherlands, and Sweden, in addition to the UK during 2009. The band had a busy schedule in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Italy during 2010 and 2011, appearing in Belgium at the Vostertfeesten Festival in August 2010. Drummer Paul Hooper left the band in early 2010 and was replaced by Glenn Taylor, formerly of Marmalade. The band then released a new studio album, &quot;Another Road&quot;.

The keyboard player in the original line-up, David Carr, lived and worked in Hollywood, California, doing session work, frequently working with The Ventures and also Kim Fowley. Carr died on 12 July 2011 from a heart attack.

Since 2011, the Fortunes have continued to appear on various 1960s theatre package shows with other artists of the era. Additionally, they have appeared in their own &quot;Past and Present&quot; theatre show and in 2015 released the accompanying &quot;Past and Present&quot; live album. In 2018 the Fortunes successfully toured Australia and keyboard player Bob Jackson retired later in the year due to ill health. He was replaced by ex Merseybeats and Tornados keyboard player and vocalist Chris Hutchison. The band continues to feature on 1960s theatre shows such as &quot;Sensational 60s&quot; and &quot;Sixties Gold&quot; as well as cruise appearances and toured the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany in 2022.

Glen Dale died at a hospice care facility after a battle with heart disease, on 13 January 2019, at age 79. Singer Shel Macrae died in 2022 at the age of 77.

===Streaming Hits in the 2020s===
In 2021 the Fortunes had two hit singles on the Amazon, Spotify and iTunes download charts with &quot;Never Too Far&quot; (Smitham/Mooney) and &quot;One Special Moment&quot; (Smitham) the band&#x27;s first chart entries since 1972. The band resumed a UK theatre tour as part of the Sensational 60s Experience package in October 2021 and released an album &quot;Special Moments&quot; in December 2021. The Fortunes signed to US label &quot;Creative &amp; Dreams&quot; in 2022, releasing the singles &quot;Hello My Friend&quot; and &quot;One Special Moment (US Remix), both hits on the UK Heritage Chart, hosted by Mike Read. In 2023 the Fortunes again charted in the Heritage Charts with their live cover of Dusty Springfield&#x27;s 60s hit &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know What to Do with Myself&quot;.

<text>Oliver Platt (born January 12, 1960) is an American actor known for his work on stage and screen. He has been nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Tony Award.

Platt made his acting debut in the 1988 film &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;. He gained prominence for his roles in &quot;The Impostors&quot; (1998), &quot;Pieces of April&quot; (2003), &quot;The Ice Harvest&quot; (2005), &quot;Casanova&quot; (2005), &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot; (2008), and &quot;Please Give&quot; (2010). His other notable roles include &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), &quot;Flatliners&quot; (1990), &quot;Beethoven&quot; (1992), &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; (1993), &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996), &quot;Bulworth&quot;, &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot; (both 1998), &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot; (2000), &quot;Kinsey&quot; (2004), &quot;2012&quot; (2009), &quot;Love &amp; Other Drugs&quot; (2010), &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; (2011), &quot;Ginger &amp; Rosa&quot; (2013), and &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; (2016). 

Platt is known for his roles in television series such as &quot;The Big C&quot;, &quot;Fargo&quot;, &quot;Chicago Med&quot; and &quot;The Good Wife&quot;. He received Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his roles in &quot;The West Wing&quot; in 2001, &quot;Huff&quot; in 2005 and 2006, and &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot; in 2008. He portrayed George Steinbrenner in the series &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot; (2007). He is also known for his recurring role as Uncle Jimmy in the Hulu series &quot;The Bear&quot; (2022–present).

Platt made his Broadway debut in the Conor McPherson play &quot;Shining City&quot; (2006) for which he earned a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination. He returned to Broadway portraying Nathan Detroit in the 2009 revival of the Frank Loesser musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
=== Family ===
Platt was born on January 12, 1960, in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, to American parents Sheila Maynard, a clinical social worker, and Nicholas Platt, a career diplomat who served as U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Zambia, and the Philippines. His older brother, Adam Platt, is a &quot;New York&quot; magazine restaurant critic. They returned to the United States when Platt was three months old.

Platt&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather was artist and architect Charles A. Platt, and his maternal great-grandparents were equestrian Arthur Scott Burden (of the industrialist Burden family) and socialite Cynthia Roche. Platt is also a great-great-grandson of General Robert Shaw Oliver (through his mother). Platt&#x27;s paternal great-great-grandfather was diplomat and lawyer Joseph Hodges Choate. Choate was the most successful lawyer in New York City during the Gilded Age and was later appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom by President William McKinley. His brother William Gardner Choate, who was also a prominent lawyer and federal judge, created Choate Rosemary Hall.

=== Early life ===
Because of his father&#x27;s career as a foreign service officer, much of Platt&#x27;s childhood was spent in Asia and Washington, D.C. Platt attended twelve different schools, including the American School in Japan, and has said &quot;Even now I find myself envying people who have neighborhoods and roots.&quot; Platt&#x27;s family made frequent trips back to Washington, where they held Redskins season tickets. Platt is also a fan of the Boston Red Sox.

When he was nine years old, Platt and his family visited the Kennedy Center in Washington, where he watched a performance that helped inspire his acting career. &quot;One of the performances that really made me want to be an actor started out with this probably 20-minute rambling, drunken monologue by this bum. And it was a young Morgan Freeman. I&#x27;ll never forget it. This guy was just so riveting. He stood there on stage alone before the curtain went up, and he held this audience utterly rapt. Including myself, obviously.&quot; According to Platt, drama departments gave his childhood some stability, &quot;It was something of a survival mechanism, in that it gave me a little subculture to plug into wherever I ended up. Kids need that. I certainly did.&quot;

=== Education ===
Platt attended a progressive boarding school named Colorado Rocky Mountain School in Carbondale, Colorado. Platt majored in drama at Tufts University, where he met and became close friends with Hank Azaria. He spent three years working in theatre in Boston, Massachusetts, which he said had a &quot;wealth of serious amateur theatre at that time…I played many roles, and it was the best training I could have had.&quot; Platt travelled with Shakespeare and Company, based in Lenox, Massachusetts, touring schools to earn his Equity card, before moving to New York. Platt&#x27;s early career involved Off-Broadway and regional theatre, and he appeared onstage with the New York Shakespeare Festival, Lincoln Center Theater, Manhattan Theatre Club and other companies across many genres. He obtained an agent while working at Manhattan Punch Line Theatre, and met actor Bill Murray at his cousin&#x27;s Christmas party. Murray attended Platt&#x27;s show and recommended Platt to director Jonathan Demme, who cast him in &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; in 1988. Platt attributes his breakthrough to appearing at the Punch Line Theater.

== Career ==
Platt makes his decisions about accepting acting roles based on the role being &quot;different from what I just did...I do have to be interested in the role&quot;. After &quot;Married to the Mob&quot;, he appeared in &quot;Working Girl&quot; (1988), &quot;Flatliners&quot; (1990), &quot;Beethoven&quot; (1992), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993), &quot;A Time to Kill&quot; (1996), &quot;Executive Decision&quot; (1996), and &quot;Bulworth&quot; (1998). In 1998 Platt and Stanley Tucci played two deadbeat actors who improvise with unsuspecting strangers in &quot;The Impostors&quot;. Tucci and Platt developed the characters while working on a play at Yale University in 1988, with Tucci later completing the screenplay and directing the film.

In 1999, Platt played the wealthy and eccentric crocodile enthusiast Hector in David E. Kelley&#x27;s &quot;Lake Placid&quot;, alongside Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda. Platt described Hector as &quot;pretty abrasive and obnoxious at times, but, I hope, he has a way of growing on you. I think David originally thought of him as a great white hunter sort of guy, but when I signed on for the role he sort of wrote him in a different direction.&quot;

The short-lived drama &quot;Deadline&quot; provided Platt&#x27;s first lead role on television. Created by Dick Wolf, who also created &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, &quot;Deadline&quot; focused on the lives of newspaper journalists in New York City. Platt starred as Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Wallace Benton, an &quot;unlikely hero&quot;. The strong cast, which also included Bebe Neuwirth and Hope Davis, could not compensate for substandard writing and the series was soon canceled. After &quot;Deadline&quot; failure, Platt avoided work on television until he read a script for &quot;The West Wing&quot; and signed on for a guest role. He received an Emmy nomination for his portrayal of no-nonsense White House Counsel Oliver Babish, brought in during season two to compile a defense for President Bartlet and others who covered up his non-disclosure of multiple sclerosis.

His role in the television series &quot;Huff&quot; as Russell Tupper from 2004 to 2006 was well-received, especially by creator Bob Lowry, who said, &quot;Oliver plays an alcoholic, drug-addicted, sexaholic, workaholic, womanizing misogynist who is adorable. I don&#x27;t know any actor who could do that. I originally saw Russell as a blond stud, but when I saw what Oliver could do, I realized how much better, richer, and less predictable he was than my idea of the character ... Oliver is very committed to the idea that story and dialogue be character-driven and unique&quot;. Platt&#x27;s work was nominated for two Emmy awards and a Golden Globe.

In 2005, Platt acted in Harold Ramis&#x27;s film &quot;The Ice Harvest&quot; as an unhappy businessman with a trophy wife and two stepchildren who becomes involved with a friend who has stolen $2 million from a Mafia boss. He also played a lard merchant named Papprizzio in Lasse Hallström&#x27;s &quot;Casanova&quot;, who competes with Casanova (Heath Ledger) for marriage to Francesca (Sienna Miller). Platt won the New York Film Critics Online Award for best supporting actor for his role in &quot;Casanova&quot;.
A Broadway production named &quot;Shining City&quot; was Platt&#x27;s Broadway debut in 2006. The play was set in Dublin, and Platt&#x27;s role was the tortured protagonist, John. &quot;Shining City&quot; director said, &quot;There is one word to describe Oliver. It&#x27;s &#x27;humanity.&#x27; He&#x27;s got that everyman quality. He&#x27;s a contradictory human being with flaws and strengths. And he&#x27;s loveable. He can simultaneously make you laugh and break your heart. Oliver has brought to the role of John what I expected and more: tremendous inventiveness and sensitivity.&quot; Platt visited Dublin to prepare for the role and ensure his performance was authentic. He was nominated for a Tony Award for &quot;Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play&quot;.

In 2007, Platt played the part of Yankees owner George Steinbrenner in the ESPN mini-series &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;. Platt signed onto the project after John Turturro was confirmed as Billy Martin, because &quot;This thing lives or dies by that portrayal ... I think it&#x27;s great casting. God knows he has the intensity.&quot; Platt starred in the pilot episode of &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, a remake of the British show of the same name in 2007. The series was not picked up by ABC. Platt starred as Nathan Detroit, alongside Lauren Graham as Miss Adelaide, in the Broadway revival of &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; which began performances at the Nederlander Theatre on February 3, 2009, and officially opened on March 1, 2009. The production closed on June 14, 2009, after 113 performances.

Platt starred as White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser in Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;2012&quot;, a disaster film released November 13, 2009. In August 2010, he was cast in the role of &quot;The Man in Black&quot; in 2011&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; spin-off, &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot;, directed by Matthew Vaughn. In 2012, he starred in the romantic comedy &quot;The Oranges&quot; alongside Hugh Laurie and Leighton Meester and appeared in the action film &quot;Chinese Zodiac&quot;. He provided the voice of Wiser the Owl in the 2013 animated film &quot;Dorothy of Oz&quot;. He appeared in Miramax&#x27;s 2016 supernatural thriller, &quot;The 9th Life of Louis Drax&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miramax Press Release 10/27/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Platt married Mary Camilla Bonsal Campbell on September 12, 1992, at the First Congregational Church in Kittery, Maine. They have three children, born 1995, 1997, and 1999. As of 1998, Platt had an open airline ticket when filming so he could return home frequently because his family did not accompany him to filming locations. In a 1999 interview, he explained that he had chosen to focus on film and television rather than theater because of his family. Platt has a home in North Haven, Maine.

<text>WOMAD ( ; World of Music, Arts and Dance) is an international arts festival. The central aim of WOMAD is to celebrate the world&#x27;s many forms of music, arts and dance.

==History==
WOMAD was founded in 1980 by English rock musician Peter Gabriel, with Thomas Brooman, Bob Hooton, Mark Kidel, Stephen Pritchard, Martin Elbourne and Jonathan Arthur. Original designers were Steve Byrne and Valerie Hawthorn. The first WOMAD festival was in Shepton Mallet, UK in 1982. The audience saw Peter Gabriel, Don Cherry, The Beat, Drummers of Burundi, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, Imrat Khan, Prince Nico Mbarga, Peter Hammill, Simple Minds, Suns of Arqa, The Chieftains and Ekome National Dance Company, founded by Barrington, Angie, Pauline and Lorna Anderson, the pioneering African arts company in the UK amongst others performing.

Gabriel and his company, which had funded WOMAD, faced financial ruin from high costs of the festival in its first year, worsened by the lack of suitable transport to the venue (Shepton Mallet Showground) and a lack of publicity. At the suggestion of Tony Smith, the manager of Gabriel and Genesis, he and the remaining members of Genesis agreed to play together for a single show under the name Six of the Best at Milton Keynes. This performance included a dynamic inclusion of Ekome National Dance Company, fusing live African Drum on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s track &quot;The Rhythm of the Heat&quot;. The show rescued the company and made it possible for further WOMAD events to take place.

Since 1982, WOMAD Festivals have travelled all over the world, bringing artists to 27 countries and entertaining over one million people. The main UK event settled at Rivermead in Reading, Berkshire, from 1990 until 2006, before moving to its present home in Charlton Park, Wiltshire from 2007.

In 2017 WOMAD UK marked its 35th anniversary. Headliners Emir Kusturica &amp; The No Smoking Orchestra, Toots and The Maytals, and Roy Ayers, Seun Kuti &amp; Egypt 80 along with 30 other artists performed for a record-setting audience for the festival of 40,000 people.

In 2022, after two forced cancellations due to the Covid-19 pandemic the UK festival returned for its 40th anniversary. Peter Gabriel appeared on stage with Friday night headliner Angelique Kidjo as well as introducing Osibisa on stage on Saturday afternoon. Other headliners included The Flaming Lips, Fatoumata Diawara &amp; Lianne La Havas. Other keys acts across the weekend on other stages included Kae Tempest, Kanda Bongo Man, Gilberto Gil, The Selector, Fulu Miziki, and Les Amazones d&#x27;Afrique.

===Festival recordings===
A triple album was released in 2007 to mark the 25th anniversary of WOMAD featuring recordings from many of the festivals in the UK and other sites across the world.

Various other Real World Records albums feature recordings from the 1982, 1988, 1996 and 2002 UK festivals.

Artists such as 23 Skidoo, Sons of Arqa, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen and Tankus The Henge have released recordings from the UK festivals.

For the 40th anniversary of the first UK festival in 2022 Real World Records released the &quot;Live at WOMAD 1982&quot; double album on CD, vinyl and download featuring mostly previously unreleased recordings from the very first UK festival. The CD included two bonus songs. The vinyl included a replica of the original poster.

==Ethos==
From the outset, the WOMAD name has reflected the festival&#x27;s idea; to be embracing but non-definitive, inspiring and outward looking; and more than anything, enthusiastic about a world that has no boundaries in its ability to communicate through music and movement.

==Programming==
WOMAD has always presented music that they felt to be of excellence, passion and individuality, regardless of musical genre or geographical origin. WOMAD encourages collaboration amongst the artists they invite to perform. The first WOMAD Festival in 1982 had Echo and the Bunnymen join forces with the Drummers of Burundi, and WOMAD Abu Dhabi 2010, saw a collaboration between Tinariwen, TV on the Radio members Kyp Malone and Tunde Adebimpe, Grammy-winning producer Ian Brennan (music producer, author), and the French Algerian Mehdi from Speed Caravan.

*Workshops. Adult workshops are taken by the musicians and will involve dance, musical instruments and discussions. Children&#x27;s workshops involve painting, circus skills, graffiti, modelling, story telling and more.
*Taste The World. Musicians cook a choice of dish from their home country in front of an audience.
*Global Market. The Global Market sells international food and wares.

==UK location==
WOMAD in the UK takes place in the grounds of Charlton Park, a stately home in Wiltshire. The arena holds at least 5 main stages with a further one in the Arboretum. An old fashioned steam fair, global market, children&#x27;s area, wellbeing section is also found on the WOMAD UK festival site.
WOMAD Charlton Park falls on the last complete weekend in July. In 2019 the capacity of the festival was 40,000.

===Previous UK locations===

After the debut 1982 performance at the Bath &amp; West Showground the festival took a sabbatical. There were some WOMAD events in 1983 at the ICA in London as part of a collaboration with Capital Radio Festival to see if there was still an audience for the brand.

1985 saw the festival move to Mersea Island in Essex with New Order, The Fall, Toots &amp; The Maytals, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, The Pogues, A Certain Ratio and Penguin Cafe Orchestra performing amongst others. (A section of Nusrat&#x27;s performance was released on CD in 2019).

1986 the festival moved to Kenn Pier Farm, Clevedon, Somerset and saw performances from Gil Scott-Heron, Misty In Roots, Siouxsie &amp; The Banshees, The Housemartins, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, The Bhundu Boys, Aswad, Hugh Masekela, 23 Skidoo and The Blue Aeroplanes amongst many others 19–20 July.

In 1987 WOMAD hosted the new world-music-focused third stage at Glastonbury Festival that went on to be called The Jazz World (and later, West Holts) stage. 1987 also saw the first of the WOMAD weekenders in Carlyon Bay, Cornwall (The Coliseum) that ran annually until 1993. (The Durutti Column released recordings from their performance here in the late 1980s).

There was a folk &amp; blues WOMAD event in 1988 at the South Hill Park Arts Centre in Bracknell. (A recording from this event was later released on CD).

1989 to 1997 WOMAD weekender events were held in Morecambe Bay, Lancashire so that the brand weren&#x27;t accused of being &quot;southern-centric&quot;.

1990-2006 The Rivermead Centre (and later Little John&#x27;s Farm), Reading, Berkshire was the permanent WOMAD UK festival home before the festival moved to its current home in Wiltshire due to needing to expand, by the time the festival had expanded and needed to move there were three stages: The Open Air, Siam and Village. (Recordings exist from several of the events). 1988 saw the Siam Tent first introduced.

The years 2003–2005 saw additional events at The Eden Project, including a special Live 8 performance (released on CD and DVD).

WOMAD came to Bristol Zoo in 2011, with a subsequent event in 2012. A boycott of the 2012 event was called for by the Captive Animals Protection Society because of concerns that noise from the festival could affect the animals&#x27; welfare.
2011 event (£20 adults over 15, children 3-14 £5, under 3 free):
Biram Seck, Gabby Young and Other Animals, Muntu Valdo, Rua MacMillan, Siyaya, The Magic Tombolinos
2012 event (same prices):
Ballet Nimba, Jaipur Kawa Brass Band, Perunika, Ska Cubano, Spiro, The Boxettes
2013 event (£17.50 for adults this year):
Diabel Cissokho, Katy Carr &amp; the Aviators, Sarah Savoy and the Francadians, The Dhol Foundation, The Barons of Tang.
(Radio Womad were also present at all three Bristol Zoo events).

2022 saw a free WOMAD commissioned event at the South Bank Centre featuring an hour long performance by Yazz Ahmed.

*WOMADelaide, Adelaide, South Australia (bi-annually from 1992 to not interfere with the then bi-annual Adelaide festival and then annually from 2004 due to its popularity and collaboration with the Adelaide Festival, no camping, capacity 30,000 daily, four days Fri-Mon mid March [originally three days until 2010]).

- WOMAD New Zealand 2021 was cancelled in late 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic complications; because of New Zealand&#x27;s social distancing regulations during the emergence of COVID, its local organizing committee argued that the financial risk was too high if restrictions were to potentially be reinstated in close proximity to the event. - The event did also not go ahead in 2022 for the same reasons, but did recommence in 2023. The 2020 event was one of the last festivals in the world to run just prior to the worldwide lockdowns were imposed.

*WOMAD Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Canary Islands, Spain (a free three day event that began in 1993, held in the modern part of the capital city&#x27;s main parks held across two stages and a third indoor stage plus activities for children, culminating in a parade on the final day, held in November).

==Radio WOMAD==

Based on Charlton Park every year since the second year (2008) the UK festival moved there, the official festival radio station is broadcast on a temporary FM licence (usually on 87.7FM) just prior to the festival opening its gates to the public and broadcasts 24 hours a day every day until late Monday after the public gates have closed. Each year the station hosts several exclusive live sessions and interviews from artists playing at the festival across the weekend. The FM signal reaches about ten miles away from the festival site.

During the forced cancellations of the festival in 2020 and 2021 the radio station was set up to broadcast remotely from several of the presenter&#x27;s homes across the UK and was broadcast live via Mixcloud where listeners could also interact with other listeners and the presenters for the &quot;WOMAD at home&quot; events. The shows showcased several highlights of previous live sessions from their archives. There was also a special live x-mas show in 2021 and two special live announcement shows in early 2022, to tie in with the line-up announcement from the festival, broadcast from station manager Steve Satan&#x27;s kitchen.

<doc id="623990" wikidata="Q1274577" url="?curid=623990" title="Popular Mechanics">
<text>Popular Mechanics (often abbreviated as PM or PopMech) is a magazine of popular science and technology, featuring automotive, home, outdoor, electronics, science, do it yourself, and technology topics. Military topics, aviation and transportation of all types, space, tools and gadgets are commonly featured.

It was founded in 1902 by Henry Haven Windsor, who was the editor and—as owner of the Popular Mechanics Company—the publisher. For decades, the tagline of the monthly magazine was &quot;Written so you can understand it.&quot; In 1958, PM was purchased by the Hearst Corporation, now Hearst Communications.

In 2013, the US edition changed from twelve to ten issues per year, and in 2014 the tagline was changed to &quot;How your world works.&quot; The magazine added a podcast in recent years, including regular features &quot;Most Useful Podcast Ever&quot; and &quot;How Your World Works&quot;.

==History==

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; was founded in Chicago by Henry Haven Windsor, with the first issue dated January 11, 1902. His concept was that it would explain &quot;the way the world works&quot; in plain language, with photos and illustrations to aid comprehension. For decades, its tagline was &quot;Written so you can understand it.&quot; The magazine was a weekly until September 1902, when it became a monthly. The Popular Mechanics Company was owned by the Windsor family and printed in Chicago until the Hearst Corporation purchased the magazine in 1958. In 1962, the editorial offices moved to New York City. In 2020, Popular Mechanics relocated to Easton, Pennsylvania, along with the additional brands in the Hearst Enthusiast Group (Bicycling and Runner&#x27;s World). That location also includes Popular Mechanics&#x27; testing facility, called the Test Zone.

From the first issue, the magazine featured a large illustration of a technological subject, a look that evolved into the magazine&#x27;s characteristic full-page, full-color illustration and a small 6.5&quot; x 9.5&quot; trim size beginning with the July, 1911 issue. It maintained the small format until 1975 when it switched the larger standard trim size. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; adopted full-color cover illustrations in 1915, and the look was widely imitated by later technology magazines.

Several international editions were introduced after World War II, starting with a French edition, followed by Spanish in 1947, and Swedish and Danish in 1949. In 2002, the print magazine was being published in English, Chinese, and Spanish and distributed worldwide. South African and Russian editions were introduced that same year.

The march 1962 issue of popular mechanics magazine aided in the June 1962 Alcatraz escape attempt, where three men, Frank Morris and John and Clarence Anglin, used the magazine as a reference to build life vests and a raft out of rubber raincoats and contact cement.

Articles have been contributed by notable people including Guglielmo Marconi, Thomas Edison, Jules Verne, Barney Oldfield, Knute Rockne, Winston Churchill, Charles Kettering, Tom Wolfe and Buzz Aldrin, as well as some US presidents including Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. Comedian and car expert Jay Leno had a regular column, &quot;Jay Leno&#x27;s Garage,&quot; starting in March, 1999.

== Editors ==
*In general, dates are the inclusive issues for which an editor was responsible. For decades, the lead time to go from submission to print was three months, so some of the dates might not correspond exactly with employment dates. As the Popular Mechanics web site has become more dominant and the importance of print issues has declined, editorial changes have more immediate impact.

== In popular culture ==
In 1999, the magazine was a puzzle on Wheel of Fortune. In April 2001, Popular Mechanics was the first magazine to go to space, traveling to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft. In December 2002, an issue featured the cover story and image of &quot;The Real Face of Jesus&quot; using data from forensic anthropologists and computer programmers.

In March 2005, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; released an issue dedicated to debunking 9/11 conspiracy theories, which has been used frequently for discrediting 9/11 &quot;trutherism.&quot; In 2006, the magazine published a book based on that article entitled &quot;Debunking 9/11 Myths: Why Conspiracy Theories Can&#x27;t Stand Up to the Facts,&quot; with a foreword by then senator John McCain.

An October 2015 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;, featuring director Ridley Scott, included an interactive cover that unlocked special content about Scott&#x27;s film &quot;The Martian&quot;. In June 2016, the magazine ran a cover story with then-Vice President of the United States Joe Biden called &quot;Things My Father Taught Me&quot; for its fatherhood issue. Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook guest-edited the September/October 2022 of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;.

The magazine is mentioned in the 2013 film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot;.

==Criticisms==
In June 2020, following several high-profile takedowns of statues of controversial historical figures, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; faced criticism from primarily conservative commentators and news outlets for an article that provided detailed instructions on how to take down statues.

In early December 2020, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; published an article titled &quot;Leaked Government Photo Shows &#x27;Motionless, Cube-Shaped&#x27; UFO.&quot; In late December, paranormal claims investigator and fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI), Kenny Biddle, investigated the claim in &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, reporting that he and investigator and CSI fellow Mick West identified the supposed UFO as a mylar Batman balloon.

<doc id="623992" wikidata="Q1185641" url="?curid=623992" title="Demilitarisation">
<text>Demilitarisation or demilitarization may mean the reduction of state armed forces; it is the opposite of militarisation in many respects. For instance, the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland entailed the reduction of British security and military apparatuses. Demilitarisation in this sense is usually the result of a peace treaty ending a war or a major conflict. The principle is distinguished from demobilisation, which refers to the drastic voluntary reduction in the size of a victorious army.

== Definitions ==
Demilitarisation was a policy in a number of countries after both world wars. In the aftermath of World War I, the United Kingdom greatly reduced its military strength, which is also referred to as disarmament. The resulting position of British military weakness during the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany was among the causes that led to the policy of appeasement.

The conversion of a military or paramilitary force into a civilian one is also called demilitarisation. For example, the Italian Polizia di Stato demilitarised in 1981, and the Austrian Gendarmerie merged with the national police, making up a new civilian body. Demilitarisation can also refer to the policies employed by Allied forces during the occupation of Japan and Germany after World War II. The Japanese and German militaries were re-badged to disassociate them from their recent war history, but were kept active and reinforced to help the allies face the new Soviet threat, which had become evident as World War II ended and the Cold War began.

Demilitarisation can also refer to the reduction of one or more types of weapons or weapons systems &quot;(See Arms Control)&quot; or the removal of combat equipment from a warship &quot;(See Japanese battleship Hiei)&quot;.

A demilitarised zone is a specific area, such as a buffer zone between nations previously engaged in armed conflict, where military persons, equipment or activities are forbidden. This can also include areas designated during conflicts in which nations, military powers or contending groups forbid military installations, activities or personnel. The demilitarised zone is also free from all activities that assist the war efforts of any of the belligerents. Generally, this zone is protected from attack and many countries forbid their troops from targeting because it would constitute a grave breach or a serious war crime that would likely warrant the institution of criminal proceedings. In the case, however, of the Korean Demilitarised Zone, of the areas beyond the demilitarized strip that separates both sides, are heavily militarized.

Examples of demilitarisation include:

* The Treaty of Versailles barred post–World War I Germany from having an air force, armoured vehicles, and certain types of naval vessels. In addition, it established a demilitarised zone in the Rhineland.
* The massive reductions of military personnel in the Allied countries, following World War I.
** The Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after World War II
* The Washington Naval Treaty
* The Chemical Weapons Convention
* The abolition of the army of Costa Rica on December 1, 1948, by President Jose Figueres.

<text>Ranger 7 was the first NASA space probe to successfully transmit close-up images of the lunar surface back to Earth. It was also the first completely successful flight of the Ranger program. Launched on July 28, 1964, Ranger 7 was designed to achieve a lunar-impact trajectory and to transmit high-resolution photographs of the lunar surface during the final minutes of flight up to impact.

The spacecraft carried six television vidicon cameras—two wide-angle (channel F, cameras A and B) and four narrow-angle (channel P)—to accomplish these objectives. The cameras were arranged in two separate chains, or channels, each self-contained with separate power supplies, timers, and transmitters so as to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality video pictures. Ranger 7 transmitted over 4,300 photographs during the final 17 minutes of its flight. After 68.6 hours of flight, the spacecraft impacted between Mare Nubium and Oceanus Procellarum. This landing site was later named Mare Cognitum. The velocity at impact was , and the performance of the spacecraft exceeded hopes. No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft.

== Aftermath of Ranger 6 and preparation for Ranger 7 ==
Although NASA had attempted to put a positive spin on Ranger 6 on the grounds that everything except the camera system had worked well, William J. Coughlin, editor of the publication &quot;Missiles and Rockets&quot;, called it a &quot;one hundred percent failure&quot; and JPL&#x27;s record thus far was &quot;a disgrace&quot;. The mission had not been a complete failure, but Coughlin was not alone in his opinion that Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, a nonprofit laboratory and extension of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), was a &quot;soft&quot; academic environment without the drive or ambition needed to make the missions succeed. He considered Ranger a &quot;loser&quot; and for a while, anyone at NASA involved in the Ranger program tried to conceal it. It was also being said that sending probes up for the sole purpose of returning images was pointless and accomplished nothing that Apollo could not also achieve.

Shortly after Ranger 6&#x27;s mission concluded a review board was convened to resolve the cause of the TV camera failure. This was determined quickly; the inadvertent activation of the camera telemetry system during ascent had been caused by an electrical short that crippled the power supply for the cameras. But why it had happened was as yet a mystery, especially as telemetry data sent back from the probe could only provide a limited amount of information. On February 14, 1964, JPL released a report noting that an internal command switch could have activated prematurely or that arcing had occurred in the umbilical connector on the payload fairing. However, there was no evidence of the latter happening or any obvious way that it could occur and several modifications were proposed to the camera system and/or the payload fairing.

The NASA review board found that Ranger 6&#x27;s systems were not as redundant as Jet Propulsion Laboratory had claimed, that prelaunch testing was inadequate, and there had been instances of the cameras turning themselves on at the RCA plant in New Jersey. If the cameras had to be completely redesigned from scratch, the next Ranger mission could be delayed almost a full year.

The full report as submitted to Congress came under criticism from several people at NASA, noting that, although the cameras lacked redundancy, any one of dozens of failure modes in the booster or spacecraft could also result in failure to return any TV images. In regards to the lack of adequate prelaunch testing, they brought up the incident in 1961 with Ranger 1 deploying its solar panels during a ground test and that ground tests with full 60 Watt power had been discontinued on the Block II probes for fear of accidentally igniting the midcourse correction engine on the pad and destroying the entire launch vehicle in the process.

RCA also promised to look into workmanship standards at their main plant in Hightstown, New Jersey, when examination of a sealed Ranger module discovered a plastic bag with screws and washers inside. Although there was suspicion that this had been done by a disgruntled employee, it was far more probable that someone had done it by accident.

Since no obvious reason for the malfunction could be found in the cameras themselves, investigation next shifted to the electrical umbilical on the payload fairing. This umbilical connector would normally be attached on the ground to permit testing of the Ranger&#x27;s subsystems and only a thin hinged door covered it during launch. One of the pins on the connector was &quot;hot&quot; and could easily be bridged, transferring a voltage to the adjacent pins and activating the TV camera system during launch. As for the cause of it, one possibility was electrostatic discharge, the other was a shock wave of some sort.

Alexander Bratenahl, a physicist at JPL&#x27;s Space Sciences Division, suggested that the electrical short was caused by venting propellant during Atlas booster section jettison. There was no tracking camera footage of this event on Ranger 6&#x27;s launch, which had occurred on an overcast day, but film of other Atlas launches showed that a large white plume enveloped the launch vehicle after staging. Convair technicians confirmed that of LOX was vented from the Atlas after staging, but although the shock wave theory seemed tempting, James Kendall, another Jet Propulsion Laboratory physicist, dismissed it out of hand. The idea of an electrostatic discharge was also unlikely given the thinning air and high altitude of the Atlas when staging occurred.

Bratenahl persisted and studied more film of Atlas launches with the frames enlarged, which revealed light flashes in the post-staging plume. Another phone call to Convair revealed that of RP-1 were also dumped during staging and that the Atlas&#x27;s sustainer engine exhaust ignited the propellant cloud, producing these flashes. Since the umbilical door on the payload shroud was only held in place with a thin latching mechanism, hot gases from igniting propellant could have contacted the electrical connector and caused a short. The inadvertent activation of the telemetry system during launch had occurred almost simultaneously with booster jettison at T+140 seconds. With that, the book could be closed on the cause of Ranger 6&#x27;s failure.

Among the changes made for Ranger 7 included new procedures to apply full power testing to the spacecraft off of the launch pad, where there was no risk of the midcourse correction engine activating on top of a fully fueled Atlas-Agena.

Jet Propulsion Laboratory had originally wanted to have Ranger 7 impact in the same general area as Ranger 6 so the impact crater could be imaged, but lighting conditions during July would not be favorable so they instead decided to go for a little-known area 11° south of the Moon&#x27;s equator near the Sea of Storms. The probe was shipped to Cape Canaveral in mid-June along with Atlas 250D and Agena 6009.

== Spacecraft design ==
Rangers 6, 7, 8 and 9 were called Block 3 versions of the Ranger spacecraft. The spacecraft consisted of a hexagonal aluminum frame base across on which was mounted the propulsion and power units, topped by a truncated conical tower which held the TV cameras. Two solar panel wings, each wide by long, extended from opposite edges of the base with a full span of , and a pointable high-gain dish antenna was hinge mounted at one of the corners of the base away from the solar panels. A cylindrical quasi-omnidirectional antenna was seated on top of the conical tower. The overall height of the spacecraft was .

Propulsion for the mid-course trajectory correction was provided by a thrust monopropellant hydrazine engine with four jet-vane vector control. Orientation and attitude control about three axes was enabled by twelve nitrogen gas jets coupled to a system of three gyros, four primary Sun sensors, two secondary Sun sensors, and an Earth sensor. Power was supplied by 9,792 silicon solar cells contained in the two solar panels, giving a total array area of and producing 200 W. Two 1200 watt-hour AgZnO batteries rated at 26.5 V with a capacity for 9 hours of operation provided power to each of the separate communication/TV camera chains. Two 1000 watt-hour AgZnO batteries stored power for spacecraft operations.

Communications were through the quasi-omnidirectional low-gain antenna and the parabolic high-gain antenna. Transmitters aboard the spacecraft included a 60 W TV channel F at 959.52 MHz, a 60 W TV channel P at 960.05 MHz, and a 3 W transponder channel 8 at 960.58 MHz. The telecommunications equipment converted the composite video signal from the camera transmitters into an RF signal for subsequent transmission through the spacecraft high-gain antenna. Sufficient video bandwidth was provided to allow for rapid framing sequences of both narrow- and wide-angle television pictures.

== Mission profile ==
On July 6, Ranger 7 completed its ground testing and was stacked atop the booster. On July 9, a NASA committee met and deemed the booster and spacecraft fully ready for launch, which was targeted for the 27th.

The first countdown on July 27 failed due to a defective battery in the Atlas and a problem with the ground guidance equipment. The next day, all went smoothly and Ranger 7 lifted off from LC-12 at 12:50 PM EST. The weather was clear and cloudless on this launch and Atlas staging was observed by tracking cameras. The expected propellant cloud enveloped the booster, but no anomalous events occurred this time. Thirty minutes after liftoff, the Agena restarted to boost Ranger 7 on a trajectory towards the Moon.

The flight trajectory for Ranger 7 was quite accurate, but a short midcourse correction was carried out early on the morning of July 29 to ensure impact in the Sea of Storms instead of the far side of the Moon. The warmup period for the TV cameras would be performed earlier and made shorter than on Ranger 6. Out of fear of jeopardizing the mission, ground controllers decided that the probe&#x27;s orientation was acceptable enough and they would not risk maneuvering with the attitude control thrusters to get into a better angle. At 6:09 AM PDT, the first video imagery reached Earth.

As Ranger 7 sped towards the surface of the Moon, TV camera performance remained normal. Images of the cratered lunar surface continued to filter back to JPL headquarters in Pasadena, California, and finally, at 6:25, impact occurred and all signals from the probe ceased. In the JPL control room, there was &quot;rapturous celebration&quot;. Ranger 7 had delivered the first close-distance imagery of the lunar surface and &quot;more than anything, even the manned Mercury missions, had at last undone the sting Americans felt at Sputnik 1&#x27;s launch&quot;.

The photographs returned from the probe found that the Moon was most likely &quot;very craggy and rocky with debris everywhere&quot;. After speaking to the media, NASA officials were peppered with the obvious question – did the Moon have a surface solid enough that humans could safely land on it? Geologist Gerard Kuiper replied that judging by the images, it seemed likely that at least some of the Moon was smooth enough to land a spacecraft on. However, the actual hardness of the surface couldn&#x27;t be determined with certainty until a soft landing was made. Nonetheless, Ranger 7&#x27;s images did seem to suggest that it was solid enough.

Ranger 7 reached the Moon on July 31. The F-channel began its one-minute warm-up 18 minutes before impact. The first image was taken at 13:08:45 UT at an altitude of . Transmission of 4,308 photographs of excellent quality occurred over the final 17 minutes of flight. The final image taken before impact has a resolution of . The spacecraft encountered the lunar surface in direct motion along a hyperbolic trajectory, with an incoming asymptotic direction at an angle of -5.57° from the lunar equator. The orbit plane was inclined 26.84° to the lunar equator. After 68.6 hours of flight, Ranger 7 impacted in an area between &quot;Mare Nubium&quot; and &quot;Oceanus Procellarum&quot; (subsequently named &quot;Mare Cognitum&quot;) at . (The impact site is listed as 10.63 S, 20.66 W in the initial report &quot;Ranger 7 Photographs of the Moon&quot;.) Impact occurred at 13:25:48.82 UT at a velocity of . The spacecraft performance was excellent and the success of the mission finally brought a turnaround in NASA&#x27;s fortunes after the endless string of lunar probe failures since 1958.

Ranger 7 is credited for beginning the &quot;peanut&quot; tradition at NASA command stations. On the success of Ranger 7, someone in the control room was noticed eating peanuts. Since 1964, control rooms ceremonially open a container of peanuts for luck and tradition.

<text>CFTU-DT (channel 29), branded , is a French-language educational independent television station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The station is owned by Savoir Media, a private consortium consisting primarily of Quebec-based post-secondary institutions. CFTU-DT&#x27;s studios are located on Rue Sainte-Catherine East and Rue Pathenais in Downtown Montreal, and its transmitter is located at Pavillon Roger-Gaudry on the campus of the Université de Montréal.

== History ==
CFTU&#x27;s history traces back to 1981, when a distance learning organization known as (the &quot;TU&quot; in the station&#x27;s callsign) negotiated with Vidéotron, the local cable provider in Montreal, to take responsibility for running an educational television service in the province. The following year, an agreement between Télé-Université and Vidéotron was reached, subsequently leading to the startup of a publicly accessible educational cable television service, using Radio-Québec as its over-the-air gateway for its programming.

In the next three years, 13 other educational institutions around Quebec, starting with the Université de Montréal, joined up with Télé-Université to provide administrative and technical support for the new television service. The institutions formed a new consortium, known as the (or &quot;CANAL&quot; for short), to co-ordinate the educational television service and prepare it to begin broadcasting over-the-air.

After over a year of test transmissions on channel 62, Télé-Université officially launched its over-the-air service, CFTU-TV on UHF channel 29, on August 20, 1986. On cable television in Montreal, it was carried on channel 26 on the West Island and 47 in the east, and was the first over-the-air television station in Canada to be given a cable assignment outside the basic band (channels 2–13) of the dial. CFTU launched under the brand name of &quot; (The Learning Channel), and later changed its branding to &quot; in 1997 and then &quot;&quot; in 2019.

==Technical information==

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
Although the analogue television shutdown and digital conversion took place on August 31, 2011, CFTU-TV was granted a temporary extension for their analogue broadcasts until October 31, 2011. This extension deadline could not be met, so a second extension was granted until December 15, 2011. When it too could not be met, a third extension until March 31, 2012, was granted.

CFTU finally turned off its analogue signal and converted to digital on February 23, 2012, broadcasting on UHF channel 29, making it the last television station in Montreal to do so; however, it broadcast in standard-definition 480i until March 28, 2013, when it began broadcasting in high definition 720p.

The digital transition slightly improved CFTU&#x27;s coverage in Montreal. For most of its history, it was plagued by a weak signal. Its analogue signal broadcast at only 10,000 watts, roughly on the same level as low-powered UHF stations in the United States. It was one of the weakest full-power stations in Canada and the second-weakest in Montreal. This effectively limited its over-the-air footprint to the Island of Montreal, Jésus Island, and a few inner-ring off-island suburbs. However, its signal was marginal at best even in Montreal. Although the station&#x27;s digital signal broadcasts at 450 watts, it penetrates further into Montreal than its analogue predecessor. However, it is not viewable in parts of downtown and southeast Montreal as its signal is blocked by Mount Royal, to the east of its transmitter at the Université de Montréal. It still relies on cable for the bulk of its viewership.

<text>CHNM-DT (channel 42) is a multicultural television station in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, part of the Omni Television network. It is owned and operated by Rogers Sports &amp; Media alongside Citytv station CKVU-DT (channel 10). The two stations share studios at the corner of West 2nd Avenue and Columbia Street (near False Creek) in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood of Vancouver; CHNM-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located atop Mount Seymour in the district municipality of North Vancouver.

==History==
Rogers Communications had made several attempts to launch a multicultural station in Vancouver similar to its successful CFMT in Toronto. Unsuccessful applications to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) were made in 1996 and again in 1999.

Asked by the federal cabinet to pursue the matter further, in 2002, the commission asked for new applications for a Vancouver multicultural station and received two—from Rogers and Multivan Broadcast, a newly formed consortium of local investors. The licence went to Multivan, with the CRTC citing its local ownership as one of the reasons for the decision. The station first signed on the air on June 27, 2003; branded on-air as &quot;channel m&quot;, CHNM originally operated from studio facilities located at the intersection of Pender and Columbia Streets in Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown. In the mid-2000s, CHNM previously produced several station IDs and program promos using a diversity theme to capitalize on the station&#x27;s former slogan &quot;Diversity Lives Here&quot;, these including spots featuring Chinese lion dancers that emerge from their lion costume with their faces painted in orange and white, the colours of the BC Lions franchise of the Canadian Football League, along with slogans supporting the team; a South Asian dancer who performs her routine to the Channel M jingle, then breaks into a country and western dance; and a leather-clad Sikh motorcyclist who boards his bike to the Channel M jingle, arranged and performed in a style mixing ZZ Top-style blues rock with East Indian music.

Following a failed 2007 bid for the multicultural licences in Calgary and Edmonton, which were awarded to Rogers, Multivan announced an agreement to sell CHNM to Rogers in July of that year. The sale was approved by the CRTC on March 31, 2008, and was finalized on April 30, 2008. With Rogers&#x27; recent acquisition of Citytv station CKVU-TV (channel 10) and the resulting sale of religious station CHNU-TV (channel 66, formerly branded as &quot;Omni.10&quot;) to S-VOX, the Omni Television brand moved to CHNM on September 1, 2008.

CHNM migrated its operations into sister station CKVU&#x27;s studio facilities at 180 West 2nd Avenue (near the Vancouver Olympic Village) on September 7, 2010. That same year, CHNM won its first-ever Jack Webster Foundation Award for Excellence in Chinese Language Reporting, for a multi-part feature on the topic of earthquake preparedness.

==Programming==
Along with carrying local newscasts, CHNM broadcasts predominantly multicultural programming and documentaries, including several independently produced magazine and entertainment programs made in-house. Formerly, these programs included &quot;German Today&quot; (German), &quot;Hola Que Tal&quot; (Spanish), &quot;Chai Time&quot; (Punjabi) (2006–2009), &quot;Mandarin Magazine&quot; (Mandarin Chinese) (2005–2009) and &quot;World Beats&quot; (an English language world music video program).

Until the beginning of the 2015–16 season, the station also aired a sizable amount of English-language American programming, including syndicated reruns of popular sitcom &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;.

===News operation===
CHNM-DT presently broadcasts hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday); the station does not produce newscasts on weekends. The station airs daily newscasts in Cantonese, Mandarin and Punjabi, and in the past, Korean and Tagalog.

CHNM&#x27;s newscasts were known as &quot;Channel M News&quot; from 2003 to 2008. During those years, the station also had a reciprocal agreement with CTV Vancouver station, which allowed the two stations to share news resources. The station&#x27;s newscasts were rebranded as &quot;Omni News&quot; in September 2008 following the approval of its sale to Rogers, and its news sharing agreement with CIVT was also terminated.

Cantonese newscasts have maintained a one-hour broadcast from their inception until 2010. It was initially broadcast at 8 pm, later changed to 9 p.m. and then to 5 p.m. on March 29, 2010. On May 17, 2010, a half-hour Cantonese late-night news was added at 11 p.m. On January 20, 2013, the late-night news was moved to 8:30 p.m.

Mandarin and Punjabi newscasts were each given half an hour at the beginning, and were later extended to one hour each on September 3, 2007.

On November 7, 2011, Omni BC&#x27;s newscasts were reduced to 30 minutes due to launch of Omni national newscasts and were aired right after the national newscasts.

On January 20, 2013, Omni&#x27;s national newscasts in Cantonese and Mandarin were cancelled due to budget cuts.

On May 7, 2015, Rogers announced a restructuring of Omni News programs as part of cutbacks that led to the loss of 110 jobs across the company. The existing newscasts would be replaced by new public affairs-oriented programs produced in Cantonese, Mandarin, and Punjabi on May 11. The new programs featured in-depth discussion of local issues but did not feature original news reporting.

The station also produced weekly phone-in programs in Cantonese, Mandarin, and Punjabi under Multivan ownership; these programs were cancelled after the station was rebranded as Omni in September 2008. In September 2012, CHNM began operating a news bureau in Victoria; the team includes bureau chief and political expert Kim Emerson.

===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
CHNM began broadcasting its digital signal on December 17, 2009, operating at reduced power. On February 12, 2010, the CRTC approved an application to increase CHNM-DT&#x27;s maximum effective power to 8.3 kilowatts. The station initially broadcast its digital signal in the 4:3 picture format (480p upconverted to 1080i), it was converted to the 16:9 format and 1080i resolution on April 26, 2011. CHNM shut down its analogue signal, over UHF channel 42, on August 31, 2011, the official date on which Canadian television stations in CRTC-designated mandatory markets transitioned from analogue to digital broadcasts. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 20, using virtual channel 42. The station flash cut its Victoria transmitter from analogue to digital signal prior to August 31, 2011.

<text>The Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain (WGGB), established in 1959, is a trade union for professional writers. It is affiliated with both the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (IAWG).

==History==
The union was founded in 1959 as the Television and Screen Writers&#x27; Guild (commonly known as the Screen Writers&#x27; Guild), the successor to the Screenwriters&#x27; Association dating back to 1938. During the 1960s it expanded to cover radio and book writers and adopted its present title in 1966. It sponsored the campaigns of the Writers&#x27; Action Group to establish the Public Lending Right and the Authors&#x27; Licensing and Collecting Society which – starting from a single room in the Writers&#x27; Guild premises – has collected and distributed over £100 million in payments to writers for photocopying and overseas retransmission of broadcasts. WGGB also hosts the annual Writers&#x27; Guild Awards. In 1997 WGGB merged with the Theatre Writers Union, and membership now stands at around 2,600. Presidents, chairs and leading activists of WGGB have included: Lord (Ted) Willis, Jimmy Perry, Bryan Forbes, Denis Norden, Maureen Duffy, Alan Plater, Rosemary Anne Sisson, Wally K. Daly, Ian Curteis, J.C. Wilsher, David Nobbs, Anthony Read, Olivia Hetreed and David Edgar, the noted playwright, TV and film writer (&quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company; &quot;Pentecost&quot;, which won an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; award in 1994; &quot;The Jail Diary of Albie Sachs&quot;; &quot;Albert Speer&quot;, based on Gitta Sereny&#x27;s biography of Hitler&#x27;s architect; &quot;Playing With Fire&quot;; etc.) The current president is Sandi Toksvig OBE.

==Activities==
It represents writers working in television, radio, film, theatre, books and multimedia.

It negotiates a series of Minimum Terms Agreements governing writers&#x27; contracts and covering minimum fees, advances, repeat fees, royalties and residuals, rights, credits, number of drafts, script alterations and the resolution of disputes. The most important MTAs cover: BBC TV Drama; BBC Radio Drama; ITV Companies; PACT (independent TV and film producers); TAC (Welsh language independent TV producers); Theatrical Management Association; Independent Theatre Council; and an agreement covering the Royal National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal Court Theatre. These agreements are regularly renegotiated and in most cases the minimum fees are reviewed annually.

WGGB advises its members on all aspects of their working lives. This includes contract vetting, legal advice, help with copyright problems and representation in disputes with producers, publishers or other writers.

Regular events are organised for members. Examples include a Meet the Agents event in London, Television Writing: Women&#x27;s Work? in Leeds, an exclusive &quot;Archers&quot; event in the West Midlands, plus screenings of new and upcoming film releases. The Annual General Meeting features an address by an industry professional/s, an opportunity to debate issues of importance to writers and amend WGGB&#x27;s rules.

==Lobbying==
WGGB is a campaigning union and effective lobbying efforts have concentrated on MEPs considering the European copyright directive, and MPs, peers and the media over the Communications Bill and the BBC Charter renewal. WGGB made strong protests when crowd violence halted performances of &quot;Behzti&quot; by Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti at the Birmingham repertory theatre in December 2004, and subsequently revived its Anti-Censorship Committee. WGGB makes a point of highlighting the importance of writing for children in all media. It co-operates closely with other unions including Equity, the Musicians&#x27; Union and the Society of Authors; and is affiliated to the British Copyright Council, Creators&#x27; Rights Alliance, Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom and other pressure groups. WGGB representatives attend regular briefings with the Arts Council, Ofcom, the Public Lending Right agency and other national bodies. Recent campaigns include the Equality Writes campaign, tackling inequality in the screen industries.

==International affiliations==
International connections include: International Affiliation of Writers Guilds (screenwriters guilds in the UK, US, Canada, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, France and Mexico); European Writers Congress (over 50 organisations); Fédération des Scénaristes d&#x27;Europe (screenwriters&#x27; groups in 14 countries); UNI-MEI (worldwide trade union organisation representing millions of workers in the TV, film, media and entertainment industries). WGGB has a reciprocal membership and services arrangement with the Irish Playwrights and Screenwriters Guild. UK WGGB members who achieve TV or film writing contracts in the US can join the Writers Guild of America without paying the usual $2,500 initial fee.

==Welfare==
The Writers&#x27; Guild Pension Scheme provides personal pension plans customised for freelance writers who may need to make irregular and sometimes small pension contributions. The scheme is coupled with clauses in several Guild MTAs entitling members to pension contributions in addition to their writing fees.

Over the years the Writers&#x27; Guild Welfare Fund has accumulated more than £40,000, which is available to provide loans or grants to members in financial difficulty.

==Membership==
Full Membership is open to anyone who has received payment for a piece of written work under a contract with terms no less than those negotiated by WGGB. Writers who do not qualify can join as Candidate Members, or Student Members.

==Awards==
The WGGB Awards were first given out in 1961. The WGGB also awards the Tinniswood Award for radio dramas, which are incorporated into the BBC Audio Drama Awards. An archive of all winners since 1961 is available on the WGGB website.

The Olwen Wymark Theatre Encouragement Awards, named in honour of playwright Olwen Wymark (1932-2013), were established in 2005 by Mark Ravenhill and David James, and are awarded annually. WGGB members are invited to make nominations &quot;to publicly thank those who have given them a positive experience in new writing over the previous year.&quot;
