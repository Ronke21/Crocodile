<doc id="624521" wikidata="Q423765" url="?curid=624521" title="Polymyxin">
<text>Polymyxins are antibiotics. Polymyxins B and E (also known as colistin) are used in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. They work mostly by breaking up the bacterial cell membrane. They are part of a broader class of molecules called nonribosomal peptides.

They are produced in nature by Gram-positive bacteria such as &quot;Paenibacillus polymyxa&quot;.

== Medical use ==
Polymyxin antibiotics are relatively neurotoxic and nephrotoxic, so are usually used only as a last resort if modern antibiotics are ineffective or are contraindicated. Typical uses are for infections caused by strains of multiple drug-resistant &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Polymyxins have less effect on Gram-positive organisms, and are sometimes combined with other agents (as with trimethoprim/polymyxin) to broaden the effective spectrum.

Polymyxins B are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, so they are only administered orally if the goal is to disinfect the GI tract. Another route of administration is chosen for systemic treatment, e.g., parenteral (often intravenously) or by inhalation. They are also used externally as a cream or drops to treat otitis externa (swimmers ear), and as a component of triple antibiotic ointment to treat and prevent skin infections.

== Mechanism of action ==
After binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, polymyxins disrupt both the outer and inner membranes. The hydrophobic tail is important in causing membrane damage, suggesting a detergent-like mode of action.

Removal of the hydrophobic tail of polymyxin B yields polymyxin nonapeptide, which still binds to LPS, but no longer kills the bacterial cell. However, it still detectably increases the permeability of the bacterial cell wall to other antibiotics, indicating that it still causes some degree of membrane disorganization.

Gram-negative bacteria can develop resistance to polymyxins through various modifications of the LPS structure that inhibit the binding of polymyxins to LPS.

Antibiotic resistance to this drug has been increasing, especially in southern China. Recently the gene &quot;mcr-1&quot;, which confers the antibiotic resistance, has been isolated from bacterial plasmids in &quot;Enterobacteriaceae&quot;.

==Chemistry==

Polymyxins are a group of cyclic non-ribosomal polypeptide (NRPs) which are biosynthesized by bacteria belonging to the genus &quot;Paenibacillus&quot;. Polymyxins consist of 10 amino acid residues, six of which are L-α,γ-diaminobutyric acid (L-DAB). The DAB residues cause polymyxins to have multiple positively charged groups at physiological pH. Seven amino acid residues form the main cyclic component, while the other three extend from one of the cyclic residues as a linear chain terminating in either 6-methyloctanoic acid or 6-methylheptanoic acid at the N-terminus. During cyclization, residue 10 is bound to the bridging residue 4. The amino acid residues and DAB monomers are generally in the L (levo) configuration, however certain strains such as P. polymyxa PKB1 have been observed to incorporate DAB with the D (dextro) configuration at position 3 producing variations of polymyxin B.

Polymyxin M is also known as &quot;mattacin&quot;.

===Biosynthesis===
The polymyxins are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthetase systems in Gram-positive bacteria such as &quot;Paenibacillus polymyxa&quot;. Like other NRPs, polymyxins are assembled by synthetases with multiple modules, each containing a set of enzyme domains that sequentially operate on the growing chain by adding the next residue and extending the chain through peptide-bond formation and condensation reactions. The final steps involve a thioesterase domain at the C-terminal of the last module to cyclize the molecule and liberate the chain from the enzyme.

== Research ==
Polymyxins are used to neutralize or absorb LPS contaminants in samples, for example in immunological experiments. Minimization of LPS contamination can be important because LPS can evoke strong reactions from immune cells, distorting experimental results.

By increasing permeability of the bacterial membrane system, polymyxin is also used in clinical work to increase the release of secreted toxins, such as &quot;Shiga&quot; toxin, from &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;.

The global problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance has led to a renewed interest in their use.

=== Compound Mixtures in Polymyxin B drug ===
----In formulations for the commercial pharmaceutical Polymyxin drug, the principal Polymyxins are B1 and B2, amounting to 75% and 15% of the final mixture, respectively. Polymyxin B1, in turn, comprises several isomers, like isoleucine-polymyxin B1 and B1-1. The major impediment in the purification and isolation of one isomer is due to the minimal structural differences between Polymyxin B1 and B2, differing only in one carbon at the 6th position of the fatty acyl side chain linked to the D-Phenylalanine of the structure. Polymyxin B1 contains 6-methyl octanoic acid, while Polymyxin B2 contains 6-methyl heptanoic acid. Similarly, Polymyxins B3 and B4 also differ at this position, with B3 containing octanoic acid and B4 featuring heptanoic acid.

<text>Buk is a town in Poznań County, in the Greater Poland Voivodeship, in central Poland. As of December 2021, the town has a population of 5,903.

==Etymology==
The town&#x27;s name means &quot;Beech&quot; in Polish, and the flag of the town shows a branch of beech, and three beech leaves. According to legend, Mieszko I, the first Christian ruler of Poland, died under a beech tree near the city.

==History==

Buk was granted town rights in 1289. It was a private church town, administratively located in the Poznań County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

Following the joint German-Soviet invasion of Poland, which started World War II in September 1939, Buk was occupied by Germany until 1945. On 10 October 1939, the Germans executed Polish parliamentarian Franciszek Górczak in Buk (see &quot;Nazi crimes against the Polish nation&quot;). In 1940, the occupiers carried out expulsions of Poles, who were deported to a transit camp in Łódź, while their houses and workshops were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. The Polish resistance was active in Buk. The Grey Ranks printed Polish underground press, conducted intelligence, organized secret Polish schooling and secret film screenings for young people, etc. In 1943, the Germans renamed the town to &quot;Buchenstadt&quot; in attempt to erase traces of Polish origin. Tadeusz Wojtczak, founder of the local units of the Grey Ranks, was arrested by the Germans in August 1943, and following a brutal investigation he was imprisoned in the infamous Fort VII in Poznań and eventually killed in the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. In January 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of prisoners of various nationalities from the dissolved camp in Żabikowo to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp passed through Buk. In 1945, Polish partisans clashed with the Wehrmacht rear security near Buk. After the war, Buk was restored to Poland, although with a Soviet-installed communist regime, which stayed in power until the Fall of Communism in the 1980s. Some members of the Polish resistance movement were persecuted by the communists after the war. In 1947, the communists arrested Henryk Blimel, leader of the local &quot;Lisy&quot; unit of the Grey Ranks, and sentenced him to 12 years in prison.

From 1945 to 1998, Buk was administratively part of the Poznań Voivodeship.

==Demographics==

==Transport==
The Polish Voivodeship roads 306 and 307 pass through the town, and the A2 motorway runs nearby, north of the town. There is also a train station in Buk.

<doc id="624527" wikidata="Q852363" url="?curid=624527" title="Wolsztyn">
<text>Wolsztyn () is a town in western Poland, on the western edge of Greater Poland Voivodeship. It is the seat of Wolsztyn County, and of the smaller administrative district of Gmina Wolsztyn.

== Geography ==
The town is situated within the historic Greater Poland region, located on the small Dojca river, a headstream of the Obra, about southwest of Poznań.

The municipal area includes a large lake (&quot;&quot;; Wolsztyn Lake), next to which is a palace built in Classical style in the early 20th century, now used as a hotel and restaurant, and a park. Nearby tourist destinations include the Pszczew Landscape Park and the Przemęt Landscape Park.

== History ==

The current settlement was established about 1285 on a causeway across the swampy Dojca River, probably by Cistercian monks descending from Obra Abbey. It developed as a centre of wool trade and cloth manufacturing on the road from Poznań to Lusatia, vested with market rights in 1424. Wolsztyn&#x27;s town privileges were confirmed in 1519. It was a private town of Polish nobility, administratively located in the Kościan County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland. A route connecting Warsaw and Poznań with Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and King Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

It was annexed by Prussia in the course of the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and after its dissolution in 1815 it was reannexed by Prussia, as part of the Grand Duchy of Posen. Wolsztyn, then called &quot;Wollstein&quot;, was the district capital of Kreis Bomst, a Prussian district which, at the time, had approximately equal numbers of Poles and Germans.

With the Prussian Province of Posen it became part of the German Empire in 1871 and a target of the Germanisation policies carried out by the German Eastern Marches Society (&quot;Hakata&quot;).

After World War I, in November 1918, Poland regained independence as the Second Polish Republic, and the town returned to Poland several weeks later, when it was captured by Polish insurgents on January 5, 1919 during the Greater Poland Uprising.

With the 1939 Invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the town was occupied by Germany on 7 September 1939 and directly incorporated into the Nazi German Reichsgau Wartheland until the end of the war in 1945. The Polish population was subjected to various crimes, including arrests, expulsions and deportations to Nazi concentration camps. The Germans established and operated a prisoner-of-war camp for Polish POWs in the present-day district of Komorowo, which then served a transit camp for expelled Poles from the region, and was eventually converted into the Stalag XXI-C POW camp for Polish, French, British, Italian, American and Norwegian POWs. The occupiers also operated a Nazi prison, and a forced labour camp for Jews. Notable Polish sculptor and painter Marcin Rożek, who lived and worked in Wolsztyn, was arrested by the Germans and then imprisoned in the Fort VII in Poznań and the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he died in 1944. The Polish resistance movement was active in the town and its environs.

From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the Zielona Góra Voivodeship.

==Sights==
The town has a Baroque parish church of the Immaculate Conception dating from the 18th century, a historical palace of the Gajewski and Mycielski noble families, which now houses a hotel, with an adjacent park, as well as several museums.

== Locomotive depot ==
The railway line from Wolsztyn to Zbąszyń opened in 1886. The locomotive roundhouse in Wolsztyn is the only place in Europe to supply standard gauge steam locomotives for regular, timetabled train services on the national railway network. As of Autumn 2023 these services run to Leszno and Poznań, using timetabled steam engines. The site also includes a railway museum featuring restored locomotives.

Since 1993 the Polish State Railways organises an annual parade of locomotives, which takes place at the start of May. The 2007 event, which also celebrated the roundhouse&#x27;s centenary, attracted about 20,000 visitors. The local (Polish) website has up-to-date information about services/events.

== Sport ==
The town is best known for its handball team KPR Wolsztyniak Wolsztyn. The local association football team is Grom Wolsztyn.

<doc id="624529" wikidata="Q1204275" url="?curid=624529" title="Ōtaki, Nagano">
<text>is a village located in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. , the village had an estimated population of 753 in 378 household, and a population density of 2.4 persons per km2. The total area of the village is . At present, Ōtaki&#x27;s land area is 95% forestland; 86% of which is designated national forest.

==Geography==
Ōtaki is located in the Kiso Mountains of southwest Nagano Prefecture, bordered by Gifu Prefecture to the west. Mount Ontake (3067 meters) is on the northern border of the village. Makio Dam is located within the village.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Gifu Prefecture
**Gero
** Nakatsugawa
*Nagano Prefecture
** Agematsu
** Kiso (town)
** Ōkuwa

===Climate===
The village has a climate characterized by warm and humid summers, and cold winters with very heavy snowfall (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Ōtaki is 8.1 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1883 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 20.95 °C, and lowest in January, at around -4.3 °C.

== Demographics ==

Demographically, the population structure of Ōtaki is similar to that found in rural areas across Japan; a rising elderly population coupled with a decline in overall population. Per Japanese census data, the population of Ōtaki has declined rapidly over the past 50 years.
==History==
The area of present-day Ōtaki was part of ancient Shinano Province, and the name of Ōtaki appears in a 1504 record as part of the Chikuma region of Shinano. The present village of Ōtaki was incorporated on April 1, 1889 by the establishment of the modern municipalities system.

In 1917, construction begins on the Ōtaki Forest Railroad (王滝 森林鉄道) The railroad was discontinued on June 30, 1975. On May 1, 1968, Chikuma District was renamed Kiso District. On September 14, 1984 the 1984 Otaki earthquake caused a section of Mount Ontake to crumble and flow into the Ōtaki Valley, with 29 people reported dead or missing and 87 homes destroyed.

==Economy==
Though tourism remains the primary industry in Ōtaki, tourist numbers (including skiers and worshipers) have declined in recent years. After tourism, manufacturing jobs are the most prevalent, followed finally by agriculture. Ōtaki is struggling economically, due in large part to public debt accrued through the building and management of Ontake 2240 ski hill. For 2008 roughly 3/4 of Ōtaki&#x27;s annual budget is slated for administrative and financial operations, with almost a quarter of this being used to pay back public debt. This leaves only a fraction of funds for use in providing basic services such as sanitation, health, and education. Major cuts have been made to the salaries of village employees and to money spent social, cultural, and educational activities.

==Education==
Ōtaki has one public elementary school and one public middle school operated by the town government. The village does not have a high school

==Transportation==

<text>Grodzisk Wielkopolski is a town in western Poland, in Greater Poland Voivodeship (Wielkopolskie), with a population of 13,703 (2006). It is south-west of Poznań, the voivodeship capital. It is the seat of Grodzisk Wielkopolski County, and also of the smaller administrative district called Gmina Grodzisk Wielkopolski. It is situated on the Letnica River. The suffix &quot;Wielkopolski&quot; distinguishes it from the town of Grodzisk Mazowiecki in east-central Poland.

A town that developed from an early medieval fortified stronghold, Grodzisk is a historic center for brewing and meat production. It has become known as the place of origin of the Grodziskie beer style, and in modern times as the home of the Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski football club, which competed in European competitions in the 2000s, achieving victories against much higher ranked and more acclaimed European clubs.

==History==

The settlement was first mentioned in 1257 by the name of Grodisze in a document by
Przemysł I of Greater Poland. It was referred to as a village belonging to the Cistercians.

The exact date when the town received its charter is unknown. Documents say that the town definitely had its town charter in 1303. It was a private town of Polish noble families of Ostroróg and Opaliński, administratively located in the Kościan County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

The first Jews settled in the town at the beginning of the 16th century. The first document to back this up was in 1505, mentioning the Jew &quot;Abraham of Grodzisk&quot; In Yiddish and Hebrew, the town is known as גרידץ (Gritz or Gritza)

Stanisław Ostroróg as a Lutheran in 1563 gave the local church to Protestants and he also founded a new school in the town. Grodzisk became an important printing center for the Polish Reformation, however in 1594 Jan Ostroróg as a supporter of Catholicism reintroduced Catholicism in the town.

In 1593, the census for Grodzisk Wielkopolski said that the population was approximately 1,160. The town charter was renewed with the inclusion of a new town about 150 metres from the old town. In 1601, the first privileges for the brewery were awarded. The town quickly became important for the production of beer (Grodziskie style). At the end of the 18th century, there were 53 breweries in the town. Also, traditions of meat production in the local butchers&#x27; guild date back to the 17th century, and today Grodzisk is known for its variety of traditional meat products (see &quot;Cuisine&quot; below). In 1626, the mayor of the city changed to the Opaliński family. They remained as mayors until 1775.
In 1793, the town was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland. Grodzisk was an important insurgent center during the Polish Kościuszko Uprising in 1794. After the successful Greater Poland uprising of 1806, it was regained by Poles and included within the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it was reannexed by Prussia, under the Germanized name &quot;Grätz&quot;. In the Greater Poland uprising (1848) during the Revolutions of 1848 a battle was fought between the Polish insurgents and Prussian troops in the present-day district of Doktorowo. From 1887 to 1918, it was the seat of Kreis Grätz.

In November 1918, after World War I, Poland regained independence, and in December local Poles formed armed units in attempt to rejoin Poland. Poles took control of the town without fighting, however volunteers from Grodzisk participated in the Greater Poland uprising in other places, as well as in the Polish–Soviet War. The town was confirmed as part of Poland in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, and was until 1932 the seat of a county or &quot;powiat&quot;.
During World War II, the town was under German occupation. In Młyniewo, a nearby village, a transit camp was formed for onward transport to Nazi concentration camps, initially for Jews and later for Poles and French, Serbian, English and Soviet prisoners of war. Poles were also subjected to expulsions, the first of which was carried out in November 1939, nevertheless, the Polish resistance movement was active in the town. Poles from Grodzisk were among the victims of massacres perpetrated during the genocidal &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; campaign at Rydzyna in November 1939. Several Poles from Grodzisk, including policemen, doctors, and a co-founder of the local Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski football club, were murdered by the Russians in the large Katyn massacre in April–May 1940. The Germans operated a Nazi prison in the town, and a subcamp of the Stalag XXI-C prisoner-of-war camp, which in June 1941 was converted into the Stalag XXI-E POW camp for British, Polish and Serbian POWs, and into the Oflag XXI-C POW camp for Allied officers in March 1942. Heliodor Jankiewicz, commander of the local unit of the &quot;Narodowa Organizacja Bojowa&quot; organization, was arrested by the Germans in September 1941, and then sentenced to death and executed the following year. On January 27, 1945, the city was taken by the Red Army, and afterwards restored to Poland.

After World War II, beer production declined and was discontinued in 1993. In 1999, Grodzisk again became a powiat seat when the powiats were reintroduced in the Polish administrative reforms.

==Culture==
A historical museum called &quot;Muzeum Ziemi Grodziskiej&quot; is located in the town.

==Cuisine==

The Grodziskie style of beer originated in the town. Grodzisk is also known for its mineral water and traditional meat products. A commemorative pump stands in the central market square in front of the town hall.

The officially protected traditional foods originating from Grodzisk Wielkopolski (as designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Poland) are various meat products, including &quot;kiełbasa grodziska&quot;, a local type of kiełbasa, &quot;salceson ozorowy grodziski&quot;, a local type of salceson, &quot;bułczanka grodziska&quot;, a local type of &quot;bułczanka&quot; (lunch meat made of pork, wheat roll and spices), and &quot;pasztetowa grodziska&quot;, a local type of pork &quot;pasztetowa&quot; (Polish liverwurst).

==Sport==
The local football team is Nasza Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski. It plays in the lower leagues, but continues the traditions of Dyskobolia Grodzisk Wielkopolski which in the 1990s and 2000s competed in the Ekstraklasa, the country&#x27;s top flight, finishing 2nd in 2003 and 2005, and also the winner of the 2007 Polish Cup.

<text>Wronki () is a town in the Szamotuły County, western-central Poland, situated in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. It is located close to the Warta River to the northwest of Poznań on the edge of Noteć Forest, and has a population of approximately 11,000.

==History==

The town&#x27;s name comes from &quot;wrona&quot;, the Polish word for a crow, which is also reflected in the town&#x27;s coat of arms. According to local rumour, in 1002 Boleslaw the Bold was once caught offside on the banks of Wronki River. The oldest known mention of Wronki comes from 1279. Trade and crafts developed in the Late Middle Ages, due to the town&#x27;s location both on the Warta river and on the trade route which connected major cities Poznań and Szczecin. At various times Wronki was either a royal town of the Polish Crown or a private town of Polish nobility. Administratively it was located in the Poznań County in the Poznań Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Kingdom of Poland.

It was annexed by Prussia in 1793 in the Second Partition of Poland, regained by Poles and included in the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, re-annexed by Prussia in 1815, and from 1871 to 1919 it also was part of Germany. The name was Germanized to &quot;Wronke&quot; when it was part of Prussia and Germany. The population was subjected to Germanisation policies, nevertheless it remained a center of Polish resistance, and Poles established various educational, industrial and sporting organizations, also one of the oldest Polish volunteer fire departments was founded in the town. At the beginning of the 20th century, Jews were 18% of the total population. After World War I, the number decreased because Wronki was restored to Poland after the country regained independence, and the Jews of Wronki belonged to the German culture.

<doc id="624546" wikidata="Q854697" url="?curid=624546" title="Hata, Nagano">
<text>was a town located in Higashichikuma District, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. Before Hata became a town, it was three villages: Kami-Hata (上波多), Shimo-Hata (下波多), and Samizo (三溝).

In 1973, these three villages merged into a town under the enforcement of the town system.

On March 31, 2010, Hata (波田町; -machi) was merged into the expanded city Matsumoto.

Originally, Hata was written as 波多 (Hata) in kanji. 波 means &quot;wave&quot; and 多 means &quot;much&quot;. The name meant &quot;many waves&quot;, reflecting the abundance of clean water the town had. In 1932, the name was changed from 波多 to the current 波田. 田 means &quot;rice paddies&quot; and reflected the town&#x27;s hope for abundant water and rice cultivation. Hata&#x27;s main industry is farming and produces various vegetables and fruits, including watermelons, corn, apples, peaches, and so on. Hata is built on a river terrace. The town&#x27;s slogan is &quot;A Fascinating Town on a River Terrace&quot; reflects this.

Hata is considered the gateway to Kamikōchi and the Northern Japan Alps because of Shin-Shimashima Station, which is used by tourists to access the park.

==Geography==
Hata sits on the left bank of the Azusagawa River on a river terrace, 700 meters above sea level.

==History==
Hata was made up of small communities in the Jōmon period. Many artifacts from stone masks to remains of houses from that period have been found in archaeological digs in Hata and have been displayed in the Tokyo National Museum.

Local tradition recalls a large flood which caused enormous damage to Hata in the early Edo period. During the cleanup, snake bones were found in the mud. The bones were enshrined to give thanks that the flood had killed all the snakes.

In the beginning of the Meiji Period, some students from Nyakutakuji helped start the Industrial Revolution in Japan. They also helped Hata become a modern town by constructing an irrigation channel and inventing a spinning machine. After that, Hata started rice production and other agriculture as well as a silk industry.

In 2007, Asian black bears entered Hata, in search of food. Crops of local farmers suffered a lot of damage. Between 10 and 15 bears were caught using mustard spray, and then the bears were returned to the mountains. The bears were tracked with radar tracking technology, and follow-up surveys were conducted. Bears continue to enter Hata, due to dwindling food supplies in their habitats.

===Nyakutakuji Temple===

It is said that Nyakutakuji Temple was founded by Gyoki (668-749) a Buddhist priest between 749 and 758, in the Nara period. During the Edo period, Nyakutakuji Temple was given ten &quot;koku&quot; of territory (&quot;koku&quot; is a denomination of land) by the feudal lord of Matsumoto, so its perimeter was about 13 kilometers and it established five branch temples. The temple prospered until the late Edo Period, and the famous author, Jippensha Ikku, stopped there. The temple prospered and was considered the &quot;Nikkō of the Hida District&quot;.

A small sub-temple, Tamura Temple, was built in the Muromachi period and enshrined the famous conquest of the Ezo by &quot;shōgun&quot; Sakanoue no Tamuramaro.

During the Meiji Era however, the Japanese government passed policies which popularized Shinto (the native Japanese religion of nature worship) and boycotted Buddhism. Thus the Nyakutakuji Temple was destroyed in 1871, leaving only the small sub-temples. Later, people tried to rebuild the temple, but they failed because of lack of support. Some of the buildings that remained were transferred to different locations, and now all that remains is a stone fence. Among the Nyakutakuji Temple Ruins, there is a Japanese cedar called &quot;Shinobu-suji&quot;. Local legend says that this tree can hear a couple&#x27;s secret wish for marriage.

===Deva Kings===
Saikoji Temple, one of the sub-temples of Nakutakuji Temple, held two Deva Kings, or guardians of the temple. They were made during the Kamakura Period. Now, the statues are located next to Kami-Hata Shrine, though they are not attached to the shrine itself, for the Deva Kings are of Buddhist origin while the shrine is Shinto. The statues were sculpted by Myokai, a monk of Zenkoji Temple. After completing the statues, Myokai inscribed his name on them. It was rare for a sculptor of Buddhist images to do this. The statues are 256 cm tall and made from Japanese cypress.

During the Edo Period, the Japanese government destroyed many temples all over Japan in order to promote the national religion of Shinto. The government destroyed Saikoji Temple, but the Deva Kings were hidden and so escaped destruction.

==Services==

Health Care

Hata is served by one general hospital, Hata Sogo Hospital (松本市立波田総合病院). The hospital also serves patients from the surrounding area.

Senior Services

Chikumano is the local senior care home and also houses a welfare office. The home offers health examinations and other care services.

Community Centers

Hata has two community event facilities. The first is Chuou Kouminkan (Central Community Center) for culture and study. Over sixty culture clubs covering art, history, cooking, language, etc. meet there. The second is Jouhou Bunka Center (Information and Cultural Center), which houses Hata&#x27;s media center and public library.

Act Hall

Located next to public library is Act Hall, the local stage space for dramas, lectures and music concerts. Built in 1995, it can seat about 310 people. The Hall also offers practice rooms (band, dance, etc.) available to rent by the hour (charges range from 500 to 900 yen depending upon the hour). In 2009, the Japanese world-famous pianist Kumamoto Mari, held a piano concert here.

In Act Hall, there is a Bosendorfer piano. It is one of the most famous models of piano. &quot;Piano Carnival&quot; is held once a year in Hata. This piano concert opens the Bosendorfer to local citizens. However, from 2011, whether it will be held or not is still unknown because of the merger with Matsumoto City.

Recreation

Hata has a number of parks, a sports gym, tennis courts, and an indoor pool.

==Hot Springs==

Ryujima Hot Spring &quot;Seseragi no Yu&quot;

There is a small hot spring in Hata called Ryujima Onsen (Dragon Island Hot Spring). It is located in the far west of Hata. If you travel on Route 158 towards Kamikōchi, you will see a sign for it on the left. Past the signboard, turn left and go across a long narrow bridge which spans the Azusagawa River. The onsen itself is located on the sandbank of the Azusagawa River and is surrounded by beautiful nature. The hot spring was first dug in 1997, and opened to the public in 2000.

There are both inside and outside baths available at Ryujima Onsen. The inside bath is a soothing stone bubble bath, while outside the bath is made from Japanese cypress. There is nice private garden which the baths look out upon. The hot spring water itself is slightly clouded and thick which is said to be good for relieving nerve and muscle pain, stiff shoulders, paralysis, and fatigue. We can relax by taking a bath while viewing the mountains and listening to the murmur of the Azusagawa River.

Outside the baths, there is a casual restaurant and a large resting room. Free barely tea was available to enjoy after your bath. Now there is only hot water served (May 2014).

Cost: ¥510 (adults), ¥250 (children)

For more information about hot spring culture see Onsen.

==Education==
Hata has four nursery schools that enroll preschool age children. Hata has one elementary school, Hata Elementary School (松本市立波田小学校), one junior high school, Hata Junior High School (松本市立波田中学校), and one high school, Azusagawa High School (長野県立梓川高校).

In 1935, Nakata Yoshikazu, a practical science teacher at Hata Secondary School planted the first apple trees in Hata in the school&#x27;s garden. Because the cultivation of apples went well, it spawned a large apple industry in Hata.

In 2006, Hata Elementary School students helped to design the town&#x27;s summer festival&#x27;s fireworks display.

==Industry and Agriculture==
Hata mainly serves as a bedroom community to Matsumoto City; however, it does have a few precision factories including Miyaji Iron Works, which contributed iron frames to structures such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building and the Great Seto Bridge.

Hata&#x27;s agriculture consists of many temperate climate fruits including apples, pears, and peaches.

===Watermelons===
The watermelons of Hata have been rated the best in Japan due to their sweetness, size, and juiciness by Japan Agricultural Cooperatives. Highly prized, the watermelons are the subject of three different town festivals and are shipped throughout Japan during late July/early August each year where they command a high price. The local climate and regional soil make Hata an ideal place to grow watermelons.

====History====
In 1935, people began to grow watermelons in Shimohara (a region of Hata). By 1950, Shimohara watermelons already had a great reputation in Matsumoto and were famous in the surrounding areas. Around 1960 the most common variety of watermelon was &quot;Kyokuto.&quot; In the mid-1960s, trucks became widespread and farmers could bring their watermelons directly to vegetable and fruit markets.

In 1981, Hata Town received 300 million yen in subsidies from the government to build a watermelon distribution center. From then on, all union members began to mark their watermelons with the brand Shimohara.

Now farmers in the town, without going through the cooperatives to market, use direct sales, but sales are limited to facilities operating in cooperation with &quot;Shimohara Watermelon.&quot; Watermelon farmers in Shimohara learned their cultivation techniques from farmers in the Namiyanagi Region(now a part of Matsumoto City), which was famous for watermelon production.

==People==
Hatakoshi Rokuza (波多腰六左) (1839–1900) was the headman of Hata Village. He constructed an irrigation channel, &quot;Hata Segi&quot; in Hata in 1871. It was built with great difficulty. The success of the irrigation channel allowed agriculture in Hata to flourish.

Gaun Tacchi (臥雲辰致) (1842–1900) was born in the Edo period, he invented the &quot;Gara Bouki&quot; in 1876. Gara Bouki is a cotton spinning machine. This was the greatest invention at the start of the modern cotton fabrics industry in Japan and is said to have started the Industrial Revolution in Japan. Gaun and his invention was supported by Hatakoshi Rokuza and others.

==Local events==

===Spring===

The Deva Kings&#x27; Festival

Children crawl between the legs of a Deva King statue for health on the third Saturday and Sunday of April. According to legend, a child who goes between the Deva King&#x27;s legs was cured of measles. The festival honors that event. Some children cry due to the carved image of the Deva King. Parents usually help out by encouraging their children.

Dogtooth Violets Festival (かたくり祭り)

The Dogtooth Violet Festival is held in the middle of April at Kami-Gaito in the west of Hata. Dogtooth violets are wild flowers which grow in the northern Japanese mountains. They bloom early in April. The flower has six beautiful violet petals. On the leaves, there are unique purple spots. From the roots, people used to make a kind of white starch called &quot;Katakuriko.&quot; But nowadays, the starch is made from potatoes instead. Years before the dogtooth violet garden was a mulberry field. The landowners have since protected the wild flowers in the field. Since 1997, the neighborhood has made a sidewalk and taken care of the area. Now, the garden has about 20 kinds of wild flowers and about 30,000 flowers in total. During the festival, which lasts for two weeks, there is a 200 yen entrance fee to the garden.

Weeping Cherry Blossoms

Anyou-ji Temple, located across from the Moriguchi Station on the Kamikōchi train line, is famous for its beautiful cherry trees in spring. Upon the temple grounds there are two dozen weeping cherry trees, two of which are between 300 and 500 years old. During the cherry blossom season, visitors can pay a small fee to enter the temple and enjoy a cup of tea while enjoying the view. But of course, simply walking around the temple grounds is also quite a fulfilling experience. The temple itself belongs to the Jodo Shinshu Honganji sect.

===Summer===

Hata Summer Festival (波田さいさい祭)

Hata Sai Sai-Sai is the town&#x27;s summer festival and most of the town&#x27;s people participate in it. The festival is held the last Saturday of July every year. It is a harvest festival for Hata&#x27;s delicious watermelon. The festival is famous for the watermelon that is handed out free of charge.

During the daytime there is a flea market and children&#x27;s games and sports. The local International Club also hosts a booth for international exchange. In the evening there are food stalls, various live performances by the brass band club from Hata Elementary School, Japanese taiko drumming, ocarina club, and the young men&#x27;s music club.

At 8:00 PM, there is a wonderful fireworks display. Fireworks designed in the shape of watermelons and apples can only be seen here in Hata. So this summer, take a straw mat and go to see the fireworks. You will be able to spend a wonderful time while looking up into the summer sky.

===Fall===

Fall Harvest Festivals (秋祭り)

In September, three shrines in Hata (San-Shrine, Suwa-Shrine, and Hata-Shrine) have their fall festivals. Festive floats that are decorated with lanterns are paraded through the streets to each shrine.

===Winter===

Winter Story

From December to January, the Hata Chamber of Commerce and Industry along with volunteers from the people of Hata decorate the area around Hata Station with a Christmas tree made from plastic bottles and Christmas lights.

==Features==
Lovers’ Hill Salad Market is named after Lovers’ Cape in the town of Toi, Shizuoka Prefecture, which was Hata Town&#x27;s sister town, before the merger with Matsumoto City.

Some local people believe there is a ghost in Hata. The ghost of a child sometimes appears around Akamatsu Ground near Shin-Shimashima Station. Some people say the ghost wears an orange shirt. Only children playing baseball on the ground have seen it. Locals attribute the ghost to a girl who drowned in the Azusa River.

The village was the main event venue for 1998 Winter Olympics (Alpine, Ski Jump, Crosscountry).

==Geography==
Hakuba is located in a mountain basin in far northwestern Nagano Prefecture, bordered by Toyama Prefecture to the west. The 2900 meter Ushiro-Tateyama Mountains border the village to the west. Much of the village is within the borders of the Chūbu-Sangaku National Park.

==History==
The area of present-day Hakuba was part of ancient Shinano Province and was part of the territory controlled by Matsumoto Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate of the Edo period. Hakuba was once part of the route called the Salt Road used to bring salt and other marine products from the coast at Itoigawa in Echigo Province (now Niigata Prefecture). However, much of the area was still virgin forest well into the Meiji period, and a census in 1881 counted only 31 households.

The modern village of Hakuba was established on September 30, 1956 by the merger of the villages of Hokujo and Kamishiro.

Hakuba and surrounding municipalities were impacted by a reported 6.7 magnitude earthquake on 22 November 2014. The quake hit at 10:08pm at a depth of 5 km causing a number of residential properties to collapse and injuring at least 41 people. Despite some localized road damage and a suspension of rail services on sections of the Ōito Line, there was however no major impact on hotels or ski tourism related infrastructure.

== Demographics ==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hakuba peaked around the year 2000 and has declined since.
==Economy==
The economy of Hakuba is heavily dependent on seasonal tourism.

==Education==
Hakuba has two public elementary schools and one public middle school operated by the village government. The village has one public high school operated by the Nagano Prefectural Board of Education.

There are 960 hectares of skiable terrain which equates to 137  km of piste. The Hakuba ski resorts are not interconnected via the slopes (except for Hakuba 47 and Goryu, and Cortina and Norikura), but they can be accessed off a common lift ticket and there are free shuttle buses to get around to the different ski areas. The ski resorts from north to south are: Cortina, Norikura, Tsugaike Kogen, Iwatake, Happo-One, Hakuba 47 (ja), Goryu, Sanosaka, Kashimayari and Jigatake.

Hakuba offers varied forms of skiing across the resorts but it is generally very well suited to beginners and intermediates with many long perfectly groomed runs and fantastic fall-line. There&#x27;s also some back country skiing on offer.

Hakuba has lessons and guiding available through both traditional Japanese ski schools and International ski schools including Hakuba Ski Concierge, Evergreen International Ski School, Happo-one Ski and Snowboard School, Hakuba Snow Sports School and Hakuba 47 Ski Academy International.

<text>Aouda (औद / &quot;Auda&quot;), a character in &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; by Jules Verne, is an Indian princess accompanied by Phileas Fogg and Passepartout. The daughter of a Bombay Parsi merchant, she was married against her will to the old raja of Bundelkhand. At the death of her husband, she is about to be sacrificed by her husband&#x27;s relatives and other people of their society as a sati on her husband&#x27;s funeral pyre. Upon learning the circumstances of the sati and how this is all against Aouda&#x27;s will, Fogg and company intervene and rescue her.

At first, Fogg attempts simply to deliver her to relatives along the way on his trip. However, when that proves impossible, she is their permanent companion who becomes more and more attracted to the intriguing and noble Fogg as she shares in the adventures. When they finally reach Britain and appear to have arrived too late to meet the deadline, Aouda fears that she ruined Fogg by causing him delays in his journey, although he firmly denies she was a problem. Now in love with the gentleman and also wishing to help him in his impoverishment, Aouda proposes to Fogg, and he joyously accepts.

As it turns out, this gesture by Aouda saves the day for them all for it prompts Passepartout to discover that by traveling east, they inadvertently arrived in London a day early and now have just enough time to sprint to the Reform Club to win the wager. The company set off for the club and arrive just in time.

Afterward, Aouda offers to end the engagement since the original motivation has been removed. However, Fogg, deeply in love and grateful for all Aouda is and has done for him, will not hear of it and they are happily married with Passepartout having the honor of giving her away at the wedding.

==Adaptations==
In the novel, Aouda changes out of her traditional sari for a typical European dress provided by Fogg. However, to emphasise the concept of the character as an Indian princess, most adaptations have her keeping her sari at least until the company completes the challenge. In addition, modern adaptations establish that she accompanies Fogg and Passepartout in the final sprint to the Reform Club when it is discovered there is still time to win the wager.

The popular Spanish-Japanese animated adaptation, &quot;Around the World with Willy Fog&quot;, compromises on this detail by having Fog invite Aouda, here named &quot;Romy&quot;, to change out of the dark-coloured funeral sari she was forced to wear for her sati and into a lighter-coloured one which she wears for remainder of the voyage. In the sequel series, &quot;Willy Fog 2&quot;, Romy eventually dons a European dress that mirrors her old dress&#x27; color-scheme although she keeps her Tilaka mark.

==Casting==
Aouda was played by: 
*Shirley MacLaine in the 1956 film adaptation of &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;
*Arlene McQuade in the &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; episode &quot;Fogg Bound&quot;
*Julia Nickson in the 1989 three-part TV mini-series.
*Shivaani Ghai in the 2021 series. 
*In the 2004 Disney live action film, Aouda is replaced by Monique La Roche, a French would-be impressionist (played by Cécile de France).

===Cultural attractions===
There are 18 designated cultural treasures in the village; the Dosojin Fire Festival is a national cultural treasure (designated as an Important Intangible Folk Cultural Property, in December 1993) while the others, including a 300-year-old cedar tree by the main shrine, are designated by the village.

===Nozawaonsen Fire Festival===
The village&#x27;s most important festival is the held every January 15; it forms part of a nationwide culture of honoring folk deities, particularly Dosojin.

This is a three-day event, with the most visible element being the battle to burn down a three-story wooden shrine (社殿 &quot;shadan&quot;) on the evening of January 15. It is not certain when the festival started, but records from 1863 suggest that it was already well-established by then.

The festival is organized by the men of the village who are 40, 41, and 42 years old; hence there is a three-year period when every male villager is closely involved in the festival. They are directed by a master carpenter chosen for his experience. The other group involved are the 25-year-old men of the village. The ages of 42 and 25 are unlucky ages, or ages where spiritual cleansing is needed, and are called yakudoshi. Participation in the event is a mandatory rite of passage for all males living in the village, regardless of whether they were born in the village or not, and is also a way to create bonds and relationships.

Part of the significance of the festival is to celebrate boys born during the previous year, and lucky families will create totem poles (初灯籠 &quot;Hatsuakarikago&quot;). These are elaborate 9-10m tall umbrella-like structures, made of oak at the bottom and cedar at the top. The family crest sits on top of the pole. The next layer down are wind chimes, and the lower layer consists of long strips of paper with charms and well-wishes written by relatives and friends. The structure is made in the autumn, and displayed outside the house from January 11. On January 15 it is taken to the fire festival ground, where it will form part of the final conflagration.

The wood that will make the &quot;shadan&quot; is chosen, cut, and brought down from the mountain to the village during the previous autumn. The 20m-long Japanese Beech is dragged from the Hikage ski area through the village, on January 13, by teams of chanting &quot;yakudoshi&quot; villagers. Sake is handed out to onlookers.

The &quot;shadan&quot; is built all day on the 14th, and until early afternoon on the 15th. Standing 10m high and 8m wide, construction can be dangerous so the work is carried out in silence and without sake. No nails or wire are used in the construction, and the construction is exactly the same every year.

At 7pm the representatives gather to light the fire by striking a flint, which has been handed down for generations. They sing the &quot;dosojin&quot; song while drinking large amounts of sake. The flame is used to light large torches, and the procession heads to the temporary shrine at 8pm. &quot;Sake&quot; is handed out to onlookers.

At about 8:30pm the procession reaches the grounds. The torches are used to light a bonfire, from which other torches are lit, and are used to attack the &quot;shadan&quot;. The festival organizers are the first to attack the shrine, followed by children, followed by all the men of the village. Their objective is to burn down the shrine, and the methodology is to light a large torch from the bonfire, and then run to the &quot;shadan,&quot; attempting to charge through the 25-year old &quot;yakudoshi&quot; who are stationed at the bottom of the shrine, and set fire to the structure. The 25-year old &quot;yakudoshi&quot; use physical force to prevent the attacks. The 42-year old &quot;yakudoshi&quot; are seated at the top of the shrine.

The attacks succeed in setting fire to the structure after one and a half to two hours, and the &quot;shadan&quot; burns through the night.

Safety is an issue and the 25-year old &quot;yakudoshi&quot; are assigned guardians who do not drink &quot;sake&quot;.

The festival attracts many visitors and accommodation is often booked a year in advance. &quot;Sake&quot; is handed out to onlookers.
Dosojin statues are common throughout Japan, but the wooden, pencil-like figures found in Nozawaonsen are unusual as (i) they are ubiquitous throughout the village (ii) they are made of wood, and painted. They represent a male and female deity. There is a folk tradition that they represent a man and a woman who were not particularly attractive, but nevertheless married and had baby boys, therefore representing the happiness of marriage. Every household in the village will have a pair, and they are often found at businesses and public places too.

<text>Chaiyasit Shinawatra (; ; born 25 June 1945) is a former commander-in-chief of the Royal Thai Army.

He was transferred from the army to become a special advisor to the Supreme Command Headquarters under the administration of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. In August 2001, Chaiyasit was promoted to deputy commander of the Armed Forces Development Command. In August 2002, he was promoted to the post of deputy commander-in-chief.

As a cousin of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, his unexpected appointment was criticised as an act of nepotism. Both Chaiyasit and the Defence Minister, General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, denied accusations of nepotism: &quot;If I&#x27;m appointed to a significant post in the Army because of my connection with the prime minister, I won&#x27;t have any friends left in the armed forces,&quot; said Chaiyasit. He said that Thaksin would not interfere with any high-level military reshuffles: &quot;It&#x27;s a shame that the prime minister&#x27;s name was tainted by such a groundless rumour.&quot;

He replaced General Surayud Chulanont, who was promoted to become supreme commander of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, as commander-in-chief in August 2003.

<text>was a village located in the mountainous Kamiminochi District, Nagano Prefecture, Japan. 

== Geography ==
Part of Togakushi is located in Myōkō-Togakushi Renzan National Park, and includes Mount Takatsuma (2353m), the highest peak in the Togakushi Mountain Range and one of the 100 Famous Japanese Mountains, and Mount Togakushi (1904m), one of the 200 most famous mountains in Japan (日本に百名山), and one of the 100 most famous mountains in Nagano (信州百名山). One of Japan&#x27;s largest campgrounds is found in Togakushi.

== History ==
The village was established on April 1, 1889 by merging Togakushi and Toyooka. On January 1, 2005, Togakushi, along with the village of Ōoka (from Sarashina District), the town of Toyono, and the village of Kinasa (all from Kamiminochi District), was merged into the expanded city of Nagano.

Togakushi was formerly known as the village of Togakure which some consider to be the birthplace of Togakure Ryu Ninpo by its founder Daisuke Nishina (Togakure).

In 2015, a branch of the Kitano Museum of Art opened in Togakushi.

== Transportation ==
Togakushi, Myoko-Togakushi renzan National Park, Togakushi Campground, and Togakushi Shrine are all accessible by local bus, with service provided by Alpico Kōtsū, from Nagano Station. 

To make the steep climb from the Nagano Basin (Zenkoji Daira), the plain in which Nagano City is located, to the mountains of Togakushi, from Nagano Station, the bus route travels the Asagawa Loop Line. The loop line was built in preparations for the 1998 Winter Olympics, to the Iizuna Kogen Ski Area. Along the way the bus passes the Spiral, the site of bobsleigh and luge competitions for the Winter Olympics. The last stops of the bus are in the Togakushi area.


==Demographics==

As of 2015, the village had an estimated population of 3,499 and a density of 26.36 persons per km2. The total area was 132.76 km2.

<text>Eros Poli (born 6 August 1963 in Isola della Scala, Veneto) is an Italian former professional racing cyclist of the 1990s, notably employed as Mario Cipollini&#x27;s lead-out man in bunch sprints.

== Biography ==
Poli won the gold medal in the Team Time Trial at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, together with Claudio Vandelli, Marcello Bartalini and Marco Giovannetti. He also rode at the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Following Cipollini&#x27;s abandonment of the 1994 Tour de France, Poli won the Montpellier to Carpentras stage (the 15th) which featured an ascent of Mont Ventoux. Poli calculated that if he broke away from the peloton by a sufficient margin on the flat run to the base of the climb of the Mont Ventoux, he would reach the summit in front in spite of his relatively poor climbing speed due to his heavy 197 cm frame. In the event, his gap of some 20 minutes was nearly closed, but he crested the climb in front and was not caught by the chasing pack on the run down to the finish of the stage in Carpentras. In that Tour, Poli won the Combativity award.

Poli rode mainly in the days before cycle helmets were compulsory in professional racing, and normally wore a casquette from which he cut out the top part, leaving just the elasticated headband and the peak to shade his eyes from the sun.

He was praised for his calculated cycling style and called the &quot;bus driver&quot;, by cyclists such Chris Boardman, for his ability to lead the gruppetto through tough stages, ensuring they all reached the cut-off time. When asked by &quot;Cycle Sport&quot; magazine what he would like his epitaph to be, he said &quot;Here lies Eros Poli, famous for being tall and coming last in the Giro d&#x27;Italia&quot;.

<doc id="624600" wikidata="Q277768" url="?curid=624600" title="Lūʻau">
<text>A lūʻau (, also anglicized as &quot;luau&quot;) is a traditional Hawaiian party or feast that is usually accompanied by entertainment. It often features Native Hawaiian cuisine with foods such as poi, &quot;kālua puaʻa&quot; (kālua pig), poke, lomi salmon, lomi oio, ʻopihi, and haupia, and is often accompanied with beer and entertainment such as traditional Hawaiian music, kanikapila, and hula. Among people from Hawaiʻi, the concepts of &quot;lūʻau&quot; and &quot;party&quot; are often blended, resulting in graduation lūʻau, wedding lūʻau, baby lūʻau, and birthday lūʻau.

==History==

In ancient Hawaiʻi, men and women ate meals separately, according to the religious kapu (taboo) system which governed the way of life of Native Hawaiians in every aspect. Commoners and women were not allowed to eat foods that were rarely eaten or foods that were only served during special occasions. However, in 1819, King Kamehameha II performed the act of eating with the women, thus ending the , and entering the period called the &quot;ʻAi Noa&quot;. Messengers were then sent over the islands announcing that eating was free and the kapu had fallen. This is when the &quot;lūʻau&quot; parties were first created, dinners or smaller gatherings called or larger feasts called .
 The modern name comes from a food often served at a lūʻau goes back at least to 1856, when so used by the Pacific Commercial Advertiser. It referenced the wedding celebration of King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma: “On the following day the palace grounds were thrown open to the native population, large numbers of whom visited the King and Queen, and partook of a luau (or native feast), prepared for them. A luau was also served up at the residence of Dr. Rooke.”

==Food==
The modern name comes from a food often served at a lūʻau: lūʻau stew, a stew that is made with &quot;lūʻau&quot; (lit. young taro leaves) and usually consist of octopus (&quot;squid&quot;) or chicken, and coconut milk. However, the highlight of many lūʻau is the , a whole pig that is slow-cooked in an (earth oven). Another dish that is served is poi, made from the roots of taro. This feast was usually served on the floor, on the mats often decorated with large centerpieces typically made of tī leaves (&quot;Cordyline fruticosa&quot;). Utensils were never present during a lūʻau; everything was eaten by hand. The thickness of was often identified by the number of fingers needed to eat it: &quot;three-finger&quot; has the thinness of applesauce; &quot;two-finger&quot;, thickness of pudding, or the thickest, &quot;one-finger poi&quot; often non-diluted and non-fermented freshly pounded taro called .

A traditional lūʻau consists of food such as:

* Chicken long rice
* Haupia
* ʻUala
* Hawaiian rolls
* Kālua puaʻa (Hawaiian roast pig)
* Kōʻelepālau
* Kūlolo
* Laulau
* Lūʻau stew
* Lomi ʻōʻio
* Lomi salmon
* Pepeiee
* Piele
* Poi
* Poke
* Tropical fruits

==Lūʻau-themed parties==
Lūʻau-themed or Hawaiian-themed parties vary in their range of dedication to Hawaiian traditions. For example, some extravagant affairs go so far as to ship food from the islands, while others settle for artificial lei, maitais, and a poolside atmosphere.

To have a lūʻau-themed party, it is essential to have an open area, such as a backyard, because lūʻau are celebrated under large tents in outdoor areas. Also a lei is a very common item in a lūʻau. A is a necklace made of plant material such as flowers, ferns, ti leaves, or nuts (polished candlenut shells). At lūʻau-themed parties, the guests can be invited to make their own to wear. Live music and entertainment are often enjoyed, such as kanikapila style. The instruments used are typically the ukulele, guitar and sometimes drums. There are also often hula dancers.

Some credit Donn Beach with the initial popularity and commercialization of lūʻaus within the continental United States. A &quot;Life&quot; article from 1946 graphically displays one of his famous lūʻaus that he held in Encino, California. In a 1986 interview Beach described his role in shaping private, home based lūʻaus into larger public affairs, where he included entertainment from singers such as Alfred Apaka.

<doc id="624603" wikidata="Q450978" url="?curid=624603" title="Winifred Atwell">
<text>Una Winifred Atwell (27 February or 27 April 1910 or 1914 – 28 February 1983) was a British pianist, born in the colony of Trinidad who migrated to Britain and who enjoyed great popularity in Britain and Australia from the 1950s with a series of boogie-woogie and ragtime hits, selling over 20 million records. She was the first black artist to have a number-one hit in the UK Singles Chart and had the first piano instrumental to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart, with “Let&#x27;s Have Another Party” in 1954, and as of 2023, remains the only female instrumentalist to do so.

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Atwell was born in Tunapuna in the British colony of Trinidad and Tobago. She and her parents lived in Jubilee Street. Her family owned a pharmacy and she trained as a pharmacist herself and was expected to join the family business. She played the piano from a young age and achieved considerable popularity locally. She played for American servicemen at the Air Force base (which is now the main airport).

It was while she was playing at the Servicemen&#x27;s Club at Piarco that someone bet her that she could not play something in the boogie-woogie style that was popular back home in the United States. She went away and wrote &quot;Piarco Boogie&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Five Finger Boogie&quot;.

===Leaving Trinidad===
Atwell left Trinidad in the early 1940s and travelled to the United States to study with Alexander Borovsky. She played in a concert at The Town Hall in New York on 10 May 1945, as part of a presentation by the Altruss Opera Company starring Paul A. Smith, a well-known tenor.

On 6 October 1945, it was announced that &quot;the noted British pianist&quot; had left for England where she would broadcast for the BBC on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In London, she gained a place at the Royal Academy of Music where she completed her musical studies. She became the first female pianist to be awarded the academy&#x27;s highest grading for musicianship. To support her studies, she played rags at London clubs and theatres. From those modest beginnings in variety she went on to top the bill at the London Palladium. She said later, &quot;I starved in a garret to get onto concert stages.&quot;

===Life in the UK===
On 21 October 1946, Atwell appeared on BBC TV programme &quot;Stars In Your Eyes&quot;, which was quickly followed by several radio appearances on the Light Programme. In January 1947, she headed the bill of &quot;Come to the Show&quot; at the Empire Theatre, Belfast, where she was billed as &quot;radio&#x27;s most versatile pianist&quot;. Frequent radio appearances continued, including the well-known &quot;Variety Bandbox&quot; show. She appeared on the variety stages too, sometimes with another pianist called Donald Thorne.

Atwell attracted attention with an unscheduled appearance at the Casino Theatre, where she substituted for an ill star. She caught the eye of entrepreneur Bernard Delfont, who put her on a long-term contract in 1948. Atwell was championed by popular disc jockey Jack Jackson, who introduced her to Decca Records promotions manager Hugh Mendl. Mendl launched his career as a staff producer at Decca by producing Atwell&#x27;s recordings. She released a number of discs for Decca in 1951 that were well received. &quot;Jezebel&quot; sold well, but it was another disc that catapulted her to huge popularity in the UK. A complex arrangement called &quot;Cross Hands Boogie&quot; was released to show her virtuoso rhythmic technique, but it was the B-side, a 1900s tune written by George Botsford called &quot;Black and White Rag&quot;, that was to become a radio standard. The disc sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

&quot;Black And White Rag&quot; started a craze for her honky-tonk style of playing. The rag was originally performed on a concert grand for the occasion, but Atwell felt it did not sound right, and so got her husband to buy a honky tonk piano for 50 shillings from a junk shop in Battersea, London, which was used for the released version of the song.

Atwell&#x27;s husband, former stage comedian Lew Levisohn, was vital in shaping her career as a variety star. The two had met in 1946, and married soon afterward. They were inseparable up to Levisohn&#x27;s death in Hong Kong in December 1977. They had no children. He had cannily made the choice, for stage purposes, of her playing first a concert grand, then the old upright piano from Battersea. This old piano became famous as &quot;my other piano&quot;, and would later feature all over the world, from Las Vegas to the Sydney Opera House, travelling over half a million miles by air throughout Atwell&#x27;s concert career. While contributing to a posthumous BBC Radio appreciation of Atwell&#x27;s career, Richard Stilgoe revealed that he had become the owner of the famous &quot;other piano&quot;.

When Atwell first came to Britain, she initially earned only a few pounds a week. By the mid-1950s, that had shot up to over $10,000. By 1952, her popularity had spread internationally. Her hands were insured with Lloyd&#x27;s of London for £40,000, the policy stipulating that she was never to wash dishes. She signed a record contract with Decca, and her sales were soon 30,000 discs a week. She was by far the biggest-selling pianist of her time. Her 1954 hit, &quot;Let&#x27;s Have Another Party&quot;, was the first piano instrumental to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart.

She is the only holder of two gold and two silver discs for piano music in Britain, and was the first black artist in the UK to sell a million records. Millions of copies of her sheet music were sold, and she went on to record her best-known hits, including &quot;Let&#x27;s Have a Party&quot;, &quot;Flirtation Waltz&quot;, &quot;The Poor People of Paris&quot; (which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1956), &quot;Britannia Rag&quot; and &quot;Jubilee Rag&quot;. Her signature &quot;Black and White Rag&quot; became famous again in the 1970s as the theme of the BBC snooker programme &quot;Pot Black&quot;, which also enjoyed great popularity in Australia when screened on the ABC network. It was during that period that she discovered Matt Monro and persuaded Decca to sign him.

Atwell&#x27;s peak was in the second half of the 1950s, during which her concerts drew standing-room-only crowds in Europe and Australasia. She played three Royal Variety Performances, appeared in every capital city in Europe, and played for over twenty million people. At a private party for Queen Elizabeth II, she was called back for an encore by the monarch herself, who requested &quot;Roll Out the Barrel&quot;. She became a firm television favourite and had her own series in Britain. The first of them was &quot;Bernard Delfont Presents The Winifred Atwell Show&quot;. It ran for ten episodes on the new ITV network from 21 April to 23 June 1956, and the BBC picked up the series the following year. On a third triumphal tour of Australia, she recorded her own Australian television series, screened in 1960–1961. During her career she earned a fortune, and her fame would have extended to the US but for the obstacles caused by racial segregation. Her breakthrough appearance was to have been on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1956, but on arrival in America she was confronted with problems of selling the show in the South with a British-sounding black woman. Her appearance was never recorded. She did, however, have a guest appearance on the Arthur Godfrey show two years later.

Atwell was also a skilled interpreter of classical music. On 1 and 2 December 1954, at London&#x27;s Kingsway Hall, with the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Stanford Robinson, she made one of the first stereo classical recordings in the UK of a major repertoire work, the Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 16, by Grieg. The two-channel version, engineered by Decca&#x27;s Roy Wallace, appears not to have been released, but a transfer of the Decca LP (mono) LF1206 has been produced and issued by Pristine Audio as an available download. Another Decca recording by Atwell is George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; with Ted Heath&#x27;s band, which contained an arrangement in the Glenn Miller style of the slow section.

===Life in Australia===
In 1955, Atwell arrived in Australia and was greeted as an international celebrity. Her tour broke box-office records on the Tivoli circuit, bringing in receipts of £600,000. She was paid AUS$5,000 a week (the equivalent of around $50,000 today), making her the highest-paid star from a Commonwealth country to visit Australia up to that time.

She toured Australia many times and made Australian guitarist, Jimmy Doyle, her musical director in the 1960s. In 1962, she made a nationwide tour of Britain, with &quot;The Winifred Atwell Show&quot;, accompanied by the Cy Bevan Group, who were with her then current radio series &quot;Pianorama&quot;. From Monday, 17 September 1962, for one week only, she gave twice-nightly performances at the Brighton Hippodrome. Also appearing with her on the bill was Ronnie Carroll, a radio and television recording star. Her popularity in Australia led to her settling in Sydney in the 1970s, and she became an Australian citizen two years before her death.

Keith Emerson noted her influence on his playing in an interview: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been into ragtime. In England—and I&#x27;m sure Rick Wakeman would concur—we loved Winifred Atwell, a fantastic honky-tonk and ragtime player.&quot;

===Later life===
Atwell bought an apartment on the beach front in Flight Deck, an apartment complex in Collaroy in Sydney, as a jumping-off base for her worldwide performance commitments. She was a member of the Moby Dick Surf Club at Whale Beach where she performed regularly in support of the surf club. Enjoying the affection of the public, she was nevertheless keenly aware of prejudice and injustice and was outspoken about racism in Australia. She always donated her services in a charity concert on Sundays, the proceeds going to orphanages and needy children. She spoke out against the Third World conditions endured by Aboriginal Australians, which made headlines during an outback tour of the country in 1962. Dismissing racism as a factor in her own life, she said she felt she was &quot;spoiled very much by the public&quot;. She left her estate to the Australian Guide Dogs for the Blind and a small amount to her goddaughter. However, a cousin of Lew Levisohn contested Atwell&#x27;s will and is reported to have been granted $30,000 from her estate.

Atwell also created headlines in the 1960s with her dieting, slimming from , using what would today be called a protein diet.

In 1978, she appeared on Australian TV&#x27;s &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. At the end of the show, she played a few bars of &quot;Black and White Rag&quot; using her &quot;other&quot; piano, which had been in retirement for many years.

Though a dynamic stage personality, Atwell was modest, shy and soft-spoken. Eloquent and intellectual, she was well read and keenly interested in and informed about issues and current events. Voracious in her reading habits and a devotee of crosswords, she confessed to an inordinate love of mangoes, a dislike of new shoes, and a keen interest in televised cricket (she backed England). She was also a devout Catholic, who unpretentiously played the organ for her parish church.

Atwell often returned to her native Trinidad and, on one occasion, she bought a house in Saint Augustine, which she adored and later renamed Winvilla. It was later turned into the Pan Pipers Music School by one of her students, Louise McIntosh. In 1968, Atwell recorded &quot;Ivory and Steel&quot;, an album of standards and classics, with the Pan Am Jet North Stars Steel Orchestra (director/arranger Anthony Williams), and supported musical scholarships in the West Indies. In the early 1980s, her sense of loss following her husband&#x27;s death made her consider returning to Trinidad to live, but she found the weather too hot.

Atwell suffered a stroke in 1980. In 1981, she officially retired on &quot;The Mike Walsh Show&quot;, then Australia&#x27;s highest-rating television variety programme. She categorically stated that she would retire and not return as a public performer, and that she had had an excellent career. Her last TV performance was &quot;Choo Choo Samba&quot;, followed by a medley of &quot;Black and White Rag&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Street Rag&quot;. Her only non-private performances from that point were as an organist in her parish church at Narrabeen.

==Death==

In 1983, following an electrical fire that destroyed her Narrabeen home, she suffered a heart attack and died while staying with friends in Seaforth. She is buried beside husband, Lew Levisohn, in Northern Rivers Memorial Park, South Gundurimba in northern New South Wales, just outside Lismore. She has a piano-shaped headstone that was paid for by Elton John.

==Awards==
In 1969, she was awarded Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s national award, the Gold Hummingbird Medal, for her achievements in music.

==Legacy==
Elton John called Atwell one of his musical heroes. John paid for Winifred&#x27;s piano-shaped headstone.

In November 2020, a Nubian Jak Community Trust black plaque honouring Atwell was unveiled at the former site of a hair salon she owned in Chaucer Road, Brixton, south London.

In 2024, Queen’s Hall Auditorium in Trinidad and Tobago was renamed to The Winifred Atwell Auditorium.

<doc id="624609" wikidata="Q1888210" url="?curid=624609" title="Football in Poland">
<text>Football is the most popular sport in Poland. Over 400,000 Poles play football regularly, with millions more playing occasionally and 27% being very interested in it. The first professional clubs were founded in the early 1900s, and the Poland national football team played its first international match in 1921.

There are hundreds of professional and amateur football teams in Poland; which are under the auspices of the national 1st league, 2nd level, 3rd level, 4 parallel divisions of 4th level, 20 regional parallel divisions of 5th level and a variety of other lower-level leagues. Additionally, there are the Polish Cup and Polish Supercup competitions.

== History ==
The history of football in Poland started in the late 19th century with the rising popularity of the new sport. At the time, the Polish state was partitioned. The first decades of Polish football are therefore connected with the history of Football in Austria and the Austrian Football Association, which was founded in 1904.

The first Polish football clubs were Lechia Lwów (1903), Czarni Lwów (1903), Pogoń Lwów (1904), KS Cracovia (1906) and Wisła Kraków (1906). The Polish national federation, called the Polish Football Union (Polski Związek Piłki Nożnej, PZPN), was founded on 20 December 1919, in Kraków when 31 delegates elected Edward Cetnarowski as the first president. The PZPN joined FIFA in 1923 and UEFA in 1955.

In a similar fashion to other European states, football appeared in Poland in the late 19th century. In 1888 Prof. Henryk Jordan, a court physician of the Habsburgs and the pioneer of sports in Poland, opened a sports park in Kraków&#x27;s &quot;Błonia&quot;, a large open space surrounding the demolished city walls of that town. The park, along with the &quot;Sokół&quot; society founded in 1867, became the main centres to promote sports and healthy living in Poland. It was Jordan who began promoting football as a healthy sport in the open air; some sources also credit him with bringing the first football to Poland from his travels to Brunswick in 1890. Other sources mention Dr. Edmund Cenar as the one to bring the first ball and the one to translate The Cambridge Rules and parts of the International Football Association Board regulations to Polish language.

On 14 July 1894 during the Second Sokół Jamboree in Lwów a short football match was played between the Sokół members of Lwów and those from Kraków. It lasted only six minutes and was seen as a curiosity rather than a potentially popular sport. Nevertheless, it was the first recorded football match in Polish history. It was won by the Lwów team after Włodzimierz Chomicki scored the only goal - the first known goal in Polish history.

This match precipitated the popularity of the new sport in Poland. Initially the rules and regulations were very simplified, with the size of the field and the ball varying greatly. Despite being discouraged by many educational societies and the state authorities, the new sport gained extreme popularity among pupils of various gymnasiums in Galicia. The first football teams were formed and in 1903–1904, four Lwów-based gymnasiums formed their own sport clubs: the IV Gymnasium for Boys formed a club later renamed to Pogoń Lwów, while the pupils of the I and II State Schools formed the &quot;Sława Lwów&quot; club, later renamed to Czarni Lwów. In the same season the Lechia Lwów was also formed. It is uncertain which of the clubs was created first as they were initially poorly organized; however, the Czarni Lwów are usually credited as being the first Polish professional football team. The following year, the popularity of the sport spread to nearby Rzeszów where Resovia Rzeszów was formed, while in the German-held part of Poland, the 1. FC Kattowitz and Warta Poznań were formed.

On 6 June 1906 a representation of Lwów youth came to Kraków for a repeat match, this time composed of two already organized teams, the Czarni and the team of the IV Gymnasium. Kraków&#x27;s representation was badly beaten in both meetings (4-0 and 2-0 respectively). The same summer the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show set up camp at Kraków&#x27;s Błonia, right outside of the traditional playground area and Jordan&#x27;s garden. On 5 August 1906 the team of the Kraków-based Jan Sobieski Gymnasium played a match against the British and American members of Buffalo Bill&#x27;s troupe, winning 1–0. The only goal scored by Stanisław Szeligowski was also the first goal scored by a Polish team in an international meeting. The success led to the popularisation of football in Kraków and to creation of the first Kraków-based professional football team, KS Cracovia - initially composed primarily of students of the Jan Sobieski Gymnasium. By the autumn of that year there were already 16 teams in Kraków, including Wisła Kraków (It is said that actually Wisła Kraków was the first professional football team and not Cracovia). In 1911, a Kraków-based Union of Polish Football for Galicia was formed and entered the Austrian Football Association. The union inspired the creation of a number of teams.

After the outbreak of World War I, most of the Galician football players, many of them members of either Strzelec or Sokół, joined Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions. The unit, fighting alongside the Austro-Hungarian Army, fought mostly in various parts of Russian-held Poland, which led to popularisation of the new sport in other parts of Poland. After Poland regained her independence, on 21 December 1919 the Polish Football Association (PZPN) was formed. Headed by Edward Centrarowski, it united most of the then-existent Polish football clubs. The league could not be formed due to the Polish-Bolshevik War, but in 1922 the PZPN published the rules of football and the following year it joined FIFA. In 1921 the league was resumed and the first champions of Poland were KS Cracovia, followed by Pogoń Lwów in 1922, 1923, 1925 and 1926. As Poland was then a fully independent state, in 1921 the Poland national football team was formed. On 18 December 1921 it played its first international match in Budapest against the Hungarian team and was defeated 1–0. In the third international match in Stockholm on 28 May 1922 Poland defeated Sweden 2–1, scoring its first international victory.

During World War II, football in occupied Poland was subject to significant restrictions (see Football in occupied Poland (1939–1945)) for more.

In 1955 the PZPN became one of the founding members of UEFA.

== Women&#x27;s football ==
In 1979, a Polish women&#x27;s football league, the Ekstraliga, was established.

On December 3, 2024, the Polish women&#x27;s national team made history by defeating Austria 1-0 in Vienna via a 94th minute goal by captain Ewa Pajor, thereby defeating the Austrians 2-0 on aggregate in a home and away playoff tie, and qualifying for their first ever major international tournament, the 2025 UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro.

== Corruption in Polish football ==
In 2005, Polish authorities began an investigation into widespread corruption within Polish football.

In July 2006, the Polish sports minister criticized the PZPN (Polish Football Association) for failing to take adequate steps to fight corruption, and announced an audit of the organization. In January 2007, PZPN board member Wit Żelazko was arrested by Wrocław police. Shortly thereafter, the entire PZPN board was suspended by the sports ministry. This move displeased FIFA which announced that the principle of autonomy of football associations was of utmost importance. The Polish sports ministry, Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński, and most fans felt that the battle against corruption was more important, but when FIFA threatened sanctions, the sports ministry backed down and agreed to re-instate the PZPN board.

In September 2008, the Polish Olympic Committee made a request to the Polish Arbitration Tribunal to suspend the management of the PZPN a second time, stating that the PZPN was guilty of &quot;[violating] its statutes in a continuous and flagrant fashion.&quot; This request was granted and Robert Zawłocki was named as temporary administrator. However, FIFA again threatened to suspend Polish teams from international competition.

On 15 April 2009, the total number of arrests reached 200, including referees, observers, coaches, players as well as some high-ranking officials of the PZPN. By the end of April 2009, only 15 referees remained who were allowed to preside over top-flight matches.

<text>In music theory, a phrase () is a unit of musical meter that has a complete musical sense of its own, built from figures, motifs, and cells, and combining to form melodies, periods and larger sections.

Terms such as &quot;sentence&quot; and &quot;verse&quot; have been adopted into the vocabulary of music from linguistic syntax. Though the analogy between the musical and the linguistic phrase is often made, still the term &quot;is one of the most ambiguous in music...there is no consistency in applying these terms nor can there be...only with melodies of a very simple type, especially those of some dances, can the terms be used with some consistency.&quot;

John D. White defines a phrase as &quot;the smallest musical unit that conveys a more or less complete musical thought. Phrases vary in length and are terminated at a point of full or partial repose, which is called a &quot;cadence&quot;.&quot; Edward Cone analyses the &quot;typical musical phrase&quot; as consisting of an &quot;initial downbeat, a period of motion, and a point of arrival marked by a cadential downbeat&quot;. Charles Burkhart defines a phrase as &quot;Any group of measures (including a group of one, or possibly even a fraction of one) that has some degree of &quot;structural completeness&quot;. What counts is the sense of completeness we hear in the pitches not the notation on the page. To be complete such a group must have an ending of some kind … . Phrases are delineated by the tonal functions of pitch. They are not created by slur or by legato performance ... . A phrase is not pitches only but also has a rhythmic dimension, and further, each phrase in a work contributes to that work&#x27;s large rhythmic organization.&quot;

==Duration or form==
In common practice phrases are often four bars or measures long culminating in a more or less definite cadence. A phrase will end with a weaker or stronger cadence, depending on whether it is an antecedent phrase or a consequent phrase, the first or second half of a period.

However, the absolute span of the phrase (the term in today&#x27;s use is coined by the German theorist Hugo Riemann) is as contestable as its pendant in language, where there can be even one-word-phrases (like &quot;Stop!&quot; or &quot;Hi!&quot;). Thus no strict line can be drawn between the terms of the &#x27;phrase&#x27;, the &#x27;motiv&#x27; or even the separate tone (as a one-tone-, one-chord- or one-noise-expression).

Thus, in views of Gestalt theory, the term of &#x27;phrase&#x27; is rather enveloping any musical expression which is perceived as a consistent &quot;gestalt&quot; separate from others, however few or many beats, i. e. distinct musical events like tones, chords or noises, it may contain.

A phrase-group is &quot;a group of three or more phrases linked together without the two-part feeling of a period&quot;, or &quot;a pair of consecutive phrases in which the first is a repetition of the second or in which, for whatever reason, the antecedent-consequent relationship is absent&quot;.

Phrase rhythm is the rhythmic aspect of phrase construction and the relationships between phrases, and &quot;is not at all a cut-and-dried affair, but the very lifeblood of music and capable of infinite variety. Discovering a work&#x27;s phrase rhythm is a gateway to its understanding and to effective performance.&quot; The term was popularized by William Rothstein&#x27;s &quot;Phrase Rhythm in Tonal Music&quot;. Techniques include overlap, lead-in, extension, expansion, reinterpretation and elision.
A phrase member is one of the parts in a phrase separated into two by a pause or long note value, the second of which may repeat, sequence, or contrast with the first. A phrase segment &quot;is a distinct portion of the phrase, but it is not a phrase either because it is not terminated by a cadence or because it seems too short to be relatively independent&quot;.

<text>Poland&#x27;s sports encompass almost all sporting disciplines, in particular: football (the most popular sport), volleyball, motorcycle speedway, ski jumping, track and field, handball, basketball, tennis, and combat sport. The first Polish Formula One driver, Robert Kubica, has brought awareness of Formula One Racing to Poland. Volleyball is one of the country&#x27;s most popular sports, with a rich history of international competition. Poland has made a distinctive mark in motorcycle speedway racing thanks to Tomasz Gollob, Jaroslaw Hampel, Bartosz Zmarzlik, Maciej Janowski and Rune Holta. Speedway is very popular in Poland. They won the world cup (2014), and the Polish Extraleague has the highest average attendances for any sport in Poland. The Polish mountains are an ideal venue for hiking, skiing and mountain biking and attract millions of tourists every year from all over the world.
Cross country skiing and ski jumping are popular TV sports, gathering 4–5 million viewers each competition, with Justyna Kowalczyk, Dawid Kubacki, Adam Małysz and Kamil Stoch as the main attractions. Baltic beaches and resorts are popular locations for fishing, canoeing, kayaking and a broad-range of other water-themed sports.

==History==
One of Poland&#x27;s national sports throughout the centuries was Equestrianism. In the interwar period Adam Królikiewicz won the first individual Olympic medal for Poland – bronze medal in the individual jumping competition in the 1924 Summer Olympics. He died after an accident during filming of the Battle of Somosierra charge in Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s film &quot;Popioły&quot;. Tadeusz Komorowski took part in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris and Henryk Dobrzański &quot;Hubal&quot; in the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. General Władysław Anders participated also in jumping competitions. Polish eventing team won two Summer Olympics medals before WWII, its member Zdzisław Kawecki was murdered in the Katyń massacre.
Many Polish champions died during WWII, many of them was murdered by the Nazis: Bronisław Czech, Helena Marusarzówna, Janusz Kusociński, Józef Noji, Dawid Przepiórka. Sport competitions for Poles were illegal under the Nazis, although sometimes organized in the camps. One such story of a Polish boxer Tadeusz Pietrzykowski imprisoned in Auschwitz and Neuengamme was filmed in 1962 as &quot;The Boxer and Death&quot;. Football matches were organized in many Nazi camps including Auschwitz, generally between prisoners but allegedly at least once the &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; fought against the SS wardens.
Polish POWs organised 1944 Olympic Games in Woldenberg camp.

Closely related to equestrianism are the mixed pairs sled horse races (&quot;kumoterki&quot;) organized in the south by the Gorals. St. Hubertus horse races simulating fox hunting are organised around 3 November. Palant (Polish baseball) was popular until about 1950. Another traditional sports were zośka (Russian Zośka, here explained as Hacky Sack, but much older), klipa, cymbergaj (similar to &quot;billiard hockey &quot;). Ringo is relatively new (since 1968).

Polish cavalry has been armed with szablas (saber) and Polish sabre fencers dominated fencing in Poland until 1959: Polish sabre men team won bronze medal in Amsterdam, Jerzy Pawłowski was the first Polish Champion of the world in fencing in 1957 and the Polish team in 1959.

Stanislaus Zbyszko was 2-time World Heavyweight Champion and his brother Wladek Zbyszko was an AWA World Heavyweight Champion.

Polish People&#x27;s Republic was controlled by the Soviet Union and the only form of legal competition with the USSR was sport. Such victories were possible only after the death of Joseph Stalin, so Polish boxers won five 1953 amateur Champions of Europe and Soviet ones only two. Władysław Kozakiewicz won the gold medal in Moscow and made Kozakiewicz&#x27;s gesture in defiance to the Soviet crowd. Many Poles believed that Stanisław Królak assaulted Soviet cyclists with his bicycle pump during 1956 Peace Race. The story seems to be invented, Królak won however the race.

Field trips during his time at the University of Kansas with Dr. Clarence McClung and Dr. Roy Moody helped prepare Taylor for his future endeavors. Between 1916 and 1920 he returned briefly to Kansas to finish his M.A.

==Career==
Upon completing his bachelor&#x27;s degree, Taylor went to the Philippines, where at first he held a teacher&#x27;s post in a village in central Mindanao, in the Industrial School for Manobo now known as the Agusan del Sur State College of Agriculture and Technology (ASSCAT). He collected and studied the local herpetofauna extensively and published many papers. He returned to the Philippines after completing his master&#x27;s degree and was appointed Chief of Fisheries in Manila. On his many survey trips he continued collecting and studying fishes and reptiles of the islands.

In 1927, back in the United States, he became the head of the zoology department of the University of Kansas at Lawrence. From 1929 to 1936, he studied the taxonomy of the genus &quot;Eumeces&quot; (some common skinks). Subsequently, he focused on Mexican herpetofauna, which he explored on many field trips from 1937 to 1948. In the following years, his explorations took him to Costa Rica, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and he published extensively on all these countries. In 1965, he turned his attention onto Caecilians after having discovered a new species on an island in the Sea of Celebes.

Along with his scientific career, Taylor was attached to intelligence operations. After World War I, he was sent to Siberia to follow the Russian Revolution under the cover of a Red Cross mission to stop a typhus epidemic. During World War II, the OSS employed Taylor to teach jungle survival in British Ceylon.

==Research==
Taylor described about 150 species and subspecies of reptile that are still recognized today, which makes him one of the most prolific reptile taxonomists of all time. Most of them are from the Philippines, but many others are from Mexico and other parts of the world.

===Eponymous taxa===
Nine reptile species named in Taylor&#x27;s honor are still recognized as valid: &quot;Trachemys taylori&quot; (Cuatrociénegas slider), &quot;Anolis taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s anole), &quot;Cyrtodactylus edwardtaylori&quot; (Badulla bow-fingered gecko), &quot;Dibamus taylori&quot; (Lesser Sunda blind lizard), &quot;Lankascincus taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s tree skink), &quot;Sceloporus edwardtaylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s spiny lizard), &quot;Sphenomorphus taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s wedge skink), &quot;Agkistrodon taylori&quot; (ornate cantil), and &quot;Pseudorabdion taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s reedsnake). &quot;Gekko taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s gecko) has been synonymized with &quot;Gekko siamensis&quot; (Siamese green-eyed gecko).

Eleven subspecies of reptile named in Taylor&#x27;s honor are still recognized as valid: &quot;Brachymeles boulengeri taylori&quot; (Negros short-legged skink), &quot;Gerrhonotus liocephalus taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s alligator lizard), &quot;Lipinia pulchella taylori&quot; (Negros beautiful lipinia), &quot;Sceloporus occidentalis taylori&quot; (Sierra fence lizard), &quot;Sphenomorphus assatus taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s forest skink), &quot;Uta stansburiana taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s side-blotched lizard); Snakes: &quot;Coniophanes picevittis taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s black-striped snake), &quot;Cyclocorus nuchalis taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s southern triangle-spotted snake), &quot;Lampropeltis triangulum taylori&quot; (Utah milksnake), and &quot;Micrurus browni taylori&quot; (Acapulco coralsnake).

Eight species of amphibian named in Taylor&#x27;s honor are still recognized as valid: &quot;Hyalinobatrachium taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s glass frog), &quot;Platymantis taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s direct-breeding frog), &quot;Craugastor taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s robber frog), &quot;Lithobates taylori&quot; (Peralta frog), &quot;Ambystoma taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s salamander), &quot;Bolitoglossa taylori&quot; (Cerro Cituro salamander), &quot;Oedipina taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s worm salamander), and &quot;Microcaecilia taylori&quot; (Taylor&#x27;s caecilian).

==Publications==
Taylor&#x27;s autobiographical memoir &quot;Edward H. Taylor: Recollection of an Herpetologist&quot; was published by the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History in 1975, with contributions from A. Byron Leonard, Hobart M. Smith, and George R. Pisani.

<doc id="624625" wikidata="Q7091329" url="?curid=624625" title="On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computer Science">
<text>&quot;On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science&quot; is a 1988 scholarly article by E. W. Dijkstra which argues that computer programming should be understood as a branch of mathematics, and that the formal provability of a program is a major criterion for correctness.

Despite the title, most of the article is on Dijkstra’s attempt to put computer science into a wider perspective within science, teaching being addressed as a corollary at the end.
Specifically, Dijkstra made a “proposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen” that
consisted of Hoare logic as an uninterpreted formal system.

== Debate over feasibility ==

Since the term &quot;software engineering&quot; was coined, formal verification has almost always been considered too resource-intensive to be feasible. In complex applications, the difficulty of correctly specifying what the program should do in the first place is also a common source of error. Other methods of software testing are generally employed to try to eliminate bugs and many other factors are considered in the measurement of software quality.

Until the end of his life, Dijkstra maintained that the central challenges of computing hadn&#x27;t been met to his satisfaction, due to an insufficient emphasis on program correctness (though not obviating other requirements, such as maintainability and efficiency).

== Pedagogical legacy ==

Computer science as taught today does not follow of Dijkstra&#x27;s advice. The curricula generally emphasize techniques for managing complexity and preparing for future changes, following Dijkstra&#x27;s earlier writings. These include abstraction, programming by contract, and design patterns. Programming techniques to avoid bugs and conventional software testing methods are taught as basic requirements, and students are exposed to certain mathematical tools, but formal verification methods are not included in the curriculum except perhaps as an advanced topic. So in some ways, Dijkstra&#x27;s ideas have been adhered to; however, the ideas he felt most strongly about have not been.

Newly formed curricula in software engineering have adopted Dijkstra&#x27;s recommendations. The focus of these programs is the formal specification of software requirements and design in order to facilitate the formal validation of system correctness. In Canada, they are often accredited engineering degrees with similar core competencies in physics-based engineering.

<text>East Ham () is a London Underground station on High Street North in the East Ham neighbourhood of the London Borough of Newham in east London, England. It is on the District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines between Upton Park and Barking stations. The station was opened on 31 March 1858 by the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway on a new more direct route from Fenchurch Street to Barking. The large Edwardian station building was constructed to accommodate the electric District Railway services on an additional set of tracks opened in 1905. It has high and growing usage for a suburban station with 13.1 million entries and exits in 2010. It is in London fare zones 3 and 4.

==History==
The London, Tilbury and Southend line from Bow to Barking was constructed east to west through the middle of the Parish of East Ham in 1858. Prior to the building of the line trains took a longer route via Stratford and Forest Gate to the north. The new line initially also had stations at Bromley and Plaistow, with Upton Park added as the next station to the west of East Ham in 1877. District line, then known as the District Railway, service began in 1902. 

The District line was electrified in 1905 over a second pair of tracks, and the service was cut back from Upminster to East Ham; the station then served as the eastern terminus, where passengers transferred to steam trains, until 1908 when electrification was extended to Barking. In 1936 the Metropolitan line service was introduced. In 1990 the station, along with other stations beyond Aldgate East, was transferred to the new Hammersmith &amp; City line.
A short spur line to Woodgrange Park was opened in 1894 and was closed in 1958.

===Accidents and incidents===
*On 12 November 1959, a passenger train overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with another standing at the station. Thirteen people were injured.
*On 14 February 1990, an empty stock train formed of a Class 305 and a Class 308 electric multiple unit was derailed.

==Design==
The station has two platforms, one for each direction. Much of the original Victorian station architecture has been retained and some restoration work was carried out during 2005. The disused platforms of the Fenchurch Street to Southend services, withdrawn in 1962, are to the south of the current platforms. A disused bay platform on the northern side of the station, closed in 1958, connected to the Tottenham and Forest Gate Railway (now the Gospel Oak to Barking line) via a curve.

==Services==

<text>Parnasala is a village in the Dummugudem mandal in the newly formed Bhadradri Kothagudem district (formerly in Khammam district) of Telangana, India. The village is accessible by road and boats and is situated 32 km from the temple town of Bhadrachalam.

Bhadrachalam area has several Hindu deities connected with Epic book Ramayana.

According to the legend, Lord Rama built a hermitage in Parnasala during his exile and lived there for some time. The hermitage was named Parnasala because it was surrounded by trees (Parna means leaves and Sala means house). It is said that Lord Rama used to offer prayers to Lord Shiva at a nearby cave temple called Shivacave.

The history of Parnasala can be traced back to the Vedic period. The Vedas mention the importance of forests and their conservation, and the forests surrounding Parnasala were considered sacred. The village is located on the banks of the river Godavari, which has been mentioned in the Vedas as one of the seven holy rivers of India.

Parnasala is also associated with the Buddhist period. The nearby town of Bhadrachalam is believed to be the birthplace of Saint Ramadasu, a devotee of Lord Rama and a renowned saint of the 17th century. The Bhadrachalam temple, which is dedicated to Lord Rama, was constructed by Saint Ramadasu.

During the British period, Parnasala was a part of the Nizam&#x27;s Hyderabad State. The village was known for its agricultural produce, especially rice and sugarcane. The people of Parnasala were skilled in making handicrafts and decorative items using bamboo and other natural materials.

In recent times, Parnasala has become a popular tourist destination. The Sri Rama Temple, which is believed to be the place where Lord Rama lived during his exile, is a major attraction. The temple is located on the banks of the river Godavari and is surrounded by lush green forests. The village is also known for its natural beauty, with the Parnasala Hill and the Kothagudem Waterfalls being popular spots for trekking and nature walks.

==Geography==
Parnasala is located at and has an average elevation of 55 metres (183 ft).

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 Indian census, the demographic details of Parnasala village are as follows:
* Total population: 513 in 116 households
* Male population: 253
* Female population: 260
* Children under 6 years of age: 51 (boys - 23 and girls - 28)
* Total literates: 429

==Legend==
According to legend, it is said the &quot;Lord Sri Rama &quot;spent some of the 14 years of exile at this location. The locals believe that Sita, the beloved consort of &quot;Lord Sri Rama&quot; bathed in the stream here and dried her clothes on &quot;Radhagutta&quot; where the imprints are seen even today. The demon king &quot;Ravana&quot; parked his Pushpaka on the hillock on the opposite side of the river and abducted her. An earthen ditch reportedly caused when Ravana removed earth to carry off Sita to Lanka can be seen here. Another Hindu legend names Parnashala as the location where Rama killed Maricha, who came in disguise of a golden deer to deceive Sita.

<doc id="624630" wikidata="Q487902" url="?curid=624630" title="Songhai people">
<text>The Songhai people (autonym: Ayneha) are an ethnolinguistic group in West Africa who speak the various Songhai languages. Their history and &quot;lingua franca&quot; is linked to the Songhai Empire which dominated the western Sahel in the 15th and 16th century. Predominantly adherents of Islam, the Songhai are primarily located in Niger and Mali. Historically, the term &quot;Songhai&quot; did not denote an ethnic or linguistic identity but referred to the ruling caste of the Songhay Empire known as the Songhaiborai. However, the correct term used to refer to this group of people collectively by the natives is &quot;Ayneha&quot;. Although some speakers in Mali have also adopted the name &quot;Songhay&quot; as an ethnic designation, other Songhay-speaking groups identify themselves by other ethnic terms such as Zarma (or Djerma, the largest subgroup) or Isawaghen. The dialect of Koyraboro Senni spoken in Gao is unintelligible to speakers of the Zarma dialect of Niger, according to at least one report. The Songhay languages are commonly taken to be Nilo-Saharan but this classification remains controversial: Dimmendaal (2008) believes that for now it is best considered an independent language family.

== Ethnonyms ==

Alternative spellings: Songai, Songay, Songhay, Songhay, Songhoi, Songhoy, Songhrai, Songhray, Songoi, Sonhrai, Sonhray, Sonrai, Sonray, Sonrhai, Sonrhay.

The correct pronunciation of &quot;Songhai&quot; in the Songhai languages is &quot;&quot;&quot;Soŋay&quot;, with the &quot;ŋ&quot;&quot; representing a velar nasal sound (the &quot;ng&quot; sound is produced by raising the back of the tongue to the soft part of the roof of the mouth, creating a resonant nasal sound). The term &quot;Sonrai&quot; is a result of French influence, stemming from their difficulty in pronouncing the original word accurately.

However, Songhai people collectively identify themselves as &quot;Ayneha&quot;, meaning &quot;I speak&quot;, and the Songhai (Songhaiborai) are a subgroup within the Ayneha. This distinct self-reference contrasts with the prevalent classification often encountered in Western literature. It may have been influenced by the Songhai word&#x27;s popularity, given that the Songhai Empire was named after the ruling caste, the Songhaiborai, which is a subgroup within the broader ethnic Ayneha community.

==Sub-groups==

*&quot;Dendi people&quot;
*&quot;Wogo people&quot;

==History==

=== Za dynasty ===

The Za dynasty or Zuwa dynasty were rulers of a medieval kingdom based in the towns of Kukiya and Gao on the Niger River in what is today modern Mali. The Songhai people at large all descended from this kingdom. The most notable of them being the Zarma subgroup who derive their name &quot;Zarma (Za Hama)&quot; from this dynasty, which means &quot;the descendants of Za&quot;.
Al-Sadi&#x27;s seventeenth century chronicle, the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, provides an early history of the Songhay as handed down by oral tradition. The chronicle reports that the legendary founder of the dynasty, Za Alayaman (also called Dialliaman), originally came from the Yemen and settled in the town of Kukiya. The town is believed to have been near the modern village of Bentiya on the eastern bank of the Niger River, north of the Fafa rapids, 134 km south east of Gao. Tombstones with Arabic inscriptions dating from the 14th and 15th centuries have been found in the area. Kukiya is also mentioned in the other important chronicle, the &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot;. The &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; relates that the 15th ruler, Za Kusoy, converted to Islam in the year 1009–1010 A.D. At some stage the kingdom or at least its political focus moved north to Gao. The kingdom of Gao capitalized on the growing trans-Saharan trade and grew into a small regional power before being conquered by the Mali Empire in the early 13th century.

===Gao Empire and Gao-Saney===
 
Gao-Saney became well known among African historians because French administrators discovered here in a cave covered with sand in 1939 several finely carved marble stelae produced in Almeria in Southern Spain. Their inscriptions bear witness of three kings of a Muslim dynasty bearing as loan names the names of Muhammad and his two successors. From the dates of their deaths it appears that these kings of Gao ruled at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries CE. 
According to recent research, the Zaghe kings commemorated by the stelae are identical with the kings of the Za dynasty whose names were recorded by the chroniclers of Timbuktu in the Ta&#x27;rikh al-Sudan and in the Ta&#x27;rikh al-Fattash. Their Islamic loan name is in one case complemented by their African name. It is on the basis of their common ancestral name Zaghe corresponding to Za and the third royal name Yama b. Kama provided in addition to &#x27;Umar b. al-Khattab that the identity between the Zaghe and the Za could be established.

It appears from this table that Yama b. Kima (or &#x27;Umar b. al-Khattab), the third king of the stelae of Gao-Saney, is identical with the 18th ruler of the list of Za kings. His name is given in the &quot;Ta&#x27;rikh al-Fattash&quot; (1665) as Yama-Kitsi and in the &quot;Ta&#x27;rikh al-Sudan&quot; (1655) as Biyu-Ki-Kima. On account of this identification the dynastic history of the Gao Empire can now to be established on a solid documentary basis. 
Apart from some Arabic epitaphs on tombstones discovered in 1939 at the cemetery of Gao-Saney (6 km to the east of the city) there are no surviving indigenous written records that date from before the middle of the 17th century. 
Our knowledge of the early history of the town relies on the writings of external Arabic geographers living in Morocco, Egypt and Andalusia, who never visited the region. These authors referred to the town as Kawkaw or Kuku. The two key 17th century chronicles, the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; and the &quot;Tarikh al-Fattash&quot;, provide information on the town at the time of the Songhai Empire but they contain only vague indications on the time before. The chronicles do not, in general, acknowledge their sources. Their accounts for the earlier periods are almost certainly based on oral tradition and for events before the second half of the 15th century they are likely to be less reliable. For these earlier periods the two chronicles sometimes provide conflicting information.
The earliest mention of Gao is by al-Khwārizmī who wrote in the first half of the 9th century. In the 9th century Gao was already an important regional power. Al-Yaqubi wrote in his &quot;Tarikh&quot; in around 872: 
There is the kingdom of the Kawkaw, which is the greatest of the realms of the Sūdān, the most important and most powerful. All the kingdoms obey its king. Al-Kawkaw is the name of the town. Besides this there are a number of kingdoms of which the rulers pay allegiance to him and acknowledge his sovereignty, although they are kings in their own lands.
In the 10th century, Gao was already Muslim and was described as consisting of two separate towns. Al-Muhallabi, who died in 990, wrote in a lost work quoted in the biographical dictionary compiled by Yaqut:
Their king pretends before his subject to be a Muslim and most of them pretend to be Muslims too. He has a town on the Nile [Niger], on the eastern bank, which is called Sarnāh, where there are markets and trading houses and to which there is continuous traffic from all parts. He has another town to the west of the Nile [Niger] where he and his men and those who have his confidence live. There is a mosque there where he prays but the communal prayer ground is between the two towns.
The archaeological evidence suggests that there were two settlements on the eastern bank of the Niger: Gao Ancien situated within the modern town, to the east of the Tomb of Askia, and the archaeological site of Gao-Saney (Sané in French) situated around 4 km to the east. The bed of the Wadi Gangaber passes to the south of the Gao-Saney occupation mound (tell) but to the north of Gao Ancien. The imported pottery and glass recovered from Gao-Saney suggest that the site was occupied between the 8th and 12th centuries. It is possible that Gao-Saney corresponds to Sarnāh of al-Muhallabi. Al-Bakri writing in 1068 also records the existence of two towns, but al-Idrisi writing in around 1154 does not. Both al-Muhallabi (see quote above) and al-Bakri situate Gao on the west (or right bank) of the Niger. The 17th century &quot;Tarikh al-Fattash&quot; also states that in the 10th century Gao was situated on the Gourma side (i.e. the west bank) of the river. A large sand dune, &quot;La Dune Rose&quot;, lies on the west bank opposite Gao, but at Koima, on the edge of the dune at a site 4 km north of Gao, surface deposits indicate a pre 9th century settlement. This could be the west bank Gao mentioned by 10th and 11th century authors. The site has not been excavated.
Al-Sadi in his &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; gives a slightly later date for the introduction of Islam. He lists 32 rulers of the Zuwa dynasty and states that in 1009–1010 A.D. the 15th ruler, Zuwa Kusoy, was the first to convert to Islam.
Towards the end of the 13th century, Gao lost its independence and became part of the expanding Mali Empire. What happened to the Zuwa rulers is not recorded. Ibn Battuta visited Gao in 1353 when the town formed part of the Mali Empire. He arrived by boat from Timbuktu on his return journey from visiting the capital of the Empire:Then I travelled to the town of Kawkaw, which is a great town on the Nīl [Niger], one of the finest, biggest, and most fertile cities of the Sūdān. There is much rice there, and milk, and chickens, and fish, and the cucumber, which has no like. Its people conduct their buying and selling with cowries, like the people of Mālī.
After staying a month in the town, Ibn Battuta left with a caravan for Takedda and from there headed north back across the Sahara to an oasis in Tuat with a large caravan that included 600 slave girls.
Sometime in the 14th century, Ali Kulun, the first ruler of the Sunni dynasty, rebelled against Mali hegemony, and was defeated.; It was not until the first half of the 15th century that Sunni Sulayman Dama was able to throw off the Mali yoke. His successor, Sunni Ali Ber (1464–1492), greatly expanded the territory under Songhay control and established the Songhay Empire.

===Under Mali Empire===
 
Towards the end of the 13th century, Gao lost its independence and became part of the expanding Mali Empire.
According to the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, the cities of Gao and Timbuktu submitted to Musa&#x27;s rule as he traveled through on his return to Mali. According to one account given by Ibn Khaldun, Musa&#x27;s general Saghmanja conquered Gao. The other account claims that Gao had been conquered during the reign of Mansa Sakura. Both of these accounts may be true, as Mali&#x27;s control of Gao may have been weak, requiring powerful mansas to reassert their authority periodically.
Both chronicles provide details on Ali Kulun (or Ali Golom) the founder of the Sunni dynasty. He revolted against the hegemony of the Mali Empire. A date is not given in the chronicles but the comment in the &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot; that the fifth ruler was in power at time when Mansa Musa made his pilgrimage suggests that Ali Kulun reigned around the end of the 14th century.
Both chronicles associate Ali Kulun (or Ali Golom) with the Mali court. The &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; relates that his father was Za Yasoboy, and as a son of a subordinate ruler of the Mali Empire, he had to serve the sultan of Mali.
The chronicles do not specify where the early rulers lived. As there is evidence that Gao remained under Mali control until the early fifteenth century, it is probably that the early Sunni rulers controlled a region to the south, with the town of Kukiya possibly serving as their capital. As the economic strength of Mali Empire relied on controlling routes across the Sahara, it would not have been necessary to control the area to the south of Gao.
Al-Sadi, the author of the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; uses the word Sunni or Sonni for the name of the dynasty while the &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot; uses the forms &quot;chi&quot; and &quot;si&#x27;i&quot;. The word may have a Malinke origin meaning &quot;a subordinate or confidant of the ruler&quot;.
Under the rule of Sunni Sulayman, the Songhai captured the Mema region to the west of Lake Débo.

===Songhai Empire===

Formerly one of the peoples subjected by the Mali Empire, the Songhai were able to reassert their control of the area around Gao after the weakening of the Mali Empire, founding the Songhai Empire which came to encompass much of the former Malian territories, including Timbuktu, famous for its Islamic universities, and the pivotal trading city of Djenné, and extending their rule over a territory that surpassed the former Mali and Ghana empires. Among Songhai&#x27;s most noted scholars was Ahmed Baba— a highly distinguished historian frequently quoted in the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; and other works. The people consisted of mostly fishermen and traders. Following Sonni Ali&#x27;s death, Muslim factions rebelled against his successor and installed Sonni Ali nephew, Askia Muhammad (formerly Muhammad Toure) who was to be the first and most important ruler of the Askia dynasty (1492–1592). Under the Askias, the Songhai empire reached its zenith.

Following Askia Muhammad, the empire began to collapse. It was enormous and could not be kept under control. The Kingdom of Morocco saw Songhay&#x27;s still flourishing salt and gold trade and decided that it would be a good asset, proceeding to conquer much of the region after the Battle of Tondibi.

===Songhai Empire Decline===
 
In 1528, Askia faced a rebellion led by his own children, resulting in the proclamation of his son Musa as king. However, Musa&#x27;s reign was short-lived as he was overthrown in 1531, leading to a period of decline for the Songhai Empire.

Amidst the internal strife and numerous civil wars plaguing the empire, Morocco surprisingly launched an invasion of the Songhai Empire. The primary motive behind this invasion was the desire to control and rejuvenate trans-Saharan trade, particularly in salt and gold. Despite Askia&#x27;s rule, the Songhai military remained traditional, composed of full-time soldiers, without modernization. In stark contrast, the invading Moroccan force boasted thousands of arquebusiers and eight English cannons.

The pivotal Battle of Tondibi on March 13, 1591, saw the Moroccans decisively defeating the Songhai army. Subsequently, they captured Gao and Timbuktu, marking the ultimate demise of the once-mighty Songhai Empire.
After the empire&#x27;s defeat, the nobles moved south to an area known today as Songhai in present Niger, where the Sonni dynasty had already settled. They formed smaller kingdoms such as Wanzarbe, Ayerou, Gothèye, Dargol, Téra, Sikié, Kokorou, Gorouol, Karma, Namaro, etc.. and further south, the Dendi which rose to prominence shortly afterwards.

===Kingdom of Dendi===
Under the Songhai Empire, Dendi had been the easternmost province, governed by the prestigious &quot;Dendi-fari&quot; (&quot;governor of the eastern front&quot;). Some members of the Askia dynasty and their followers fled here after being defeated by the invading Saadi dynasty of Morocco at the Battle of Tondibi and at another battle seven months later. There, they resisted Moroccan Invaders and maintained the tradition of the Songhai with the same Askia rulers and their newly established capital at Lulami. The first ruler, Askia Ishaq II was deposed by his brother Muhammad Gao, who was in turn murdered on the order of the Moroccan pasha. The Moroccans then appointed Sulayman as puppet king ruling the Niger between Djenné and Gao. South of Tillaberi, the Songhai resistance against Morocco continued under Askia Nuh, a son of Askia Dawud. He established his capital at Lulami.
===Arma Pashalik of Timbuktu===

Following the Moroccan army&#x27;s triumph at Battle of Tondibi and the subsequent capture of Gao, Timbuktu, and Djenné, the Pashalik of Timbuktu was established, designating Timbuktu as its capital. Commencing in 1618, the Pasha, initially appointed by the Sultan of Morocco, transitioned to being elected by the Arma.

Despite governing the Pashalik as an independent republic, the Armas continued to acknowledge Moroccan sultans as their leaders. During the civil war following Ahmad al-Mansur&#x27;s death in Morocco, the Pashalik supported the legitimate Sultan, Zidan al-Nasir, and by 1670, they pledged allegiance to the Alaouite sultans. and in 1670 they recognized the Alaouites and pledged allegiance.

However, this allegiance was short-lived. By the early eighteenth century, the Pashalik revoked Moroccan suzerainty. Local traditions attribute this event to Gurdu, a learned scholar believed to have supernatural powers. According to tradition, &quot;Gurdu&quot; halted slavery by sending his youngest student to sign a document, prohibiting the yearly exchange of slaves from Timbuktu.

By the mid-eighteenth century, the pashalik was in decline. Around 1770, the Tuareg seized Gao, and in 1787, they entered Timbuktu, establishing the Pashalik as their tributary.

===Zabarma Emirate (1860-1897)===

The Zabarma Emirate was an Islamic state that existed from the 1860s to 1897 in what is now parts of Northern Ghana and Burkina Faso. Founded by the Zarma people, a subgroup of the Songhai, the Zabarma Emirate, despite its Zarma origins, was diverse, with the Zarma constituting a minority. It was primarily composed of Hausa, Fulani, Mossi, and notably the Gurunsi people, who played a crucial role as allies and soldiers.

The word &quot;Gurunsi&quot; is derived from the Zarma language, &quot;Guru-si,&quot; meaning &quot;iron does not penetrate.&quot; During the Zarma conquest of Gurunsi lands in the late 19th century, the Zarma leader, Baba Ato Zato (known as Babatu in the Hausa corruption of his name), enlisted a battalion of indigenous men who, after ingesting traditional medicines, were believed to be impervious to iron.

In 1887, Zabarma Emirate forces raided Wa, the capital of the Kingdom of Wala, prompting a significant population displacement.

This event marked the beginning of enduring playful ethnic banter and slavery jokes between the Zarma and the Gurunsi communities in Ghana.

Despite their minority status, the Zarma effectively enlisted followers of diverse origins, cultivating lasting loyalty. The Emirs of the Zabarima Emirate included Hanno or Alfa Hanno dan Tadano, Gazari or Alfa Gazare dan Mahama, and Babatu or Mahama dan Issa (commonly known as Babatu in colonial literature).

In a series of battles, the French, alongside local allies, defeated Babatu and his Zarma army at Gandiogo on March 14, 1897, and again at Doucie on June 23, 1897. Survivors fled south, prompting British military action in October 1897, concluding in June 1898 with the defeat of Babatu&#x27;s former private army.

As the British presence expanded in Gambaga and areas east of the Black Volta, authorities of the Zabarma Emirate in the Gurunsi region fled eastward toward Dagbon.

===Dares-Salam (Marabadiassa) imamate ( 1883-1898)===

The Zerma warriors and traders from the Niger valleys, East of Niamey, under the leadership of Mori Ture, Zerma warlord and leader of militant Islam (Jihad) in current Northern part of Ivory Coast, attacked the Tagouana and Djimini, defeating the former and signing the truce with the latter, A second Zerma attack brought all the southern senufo to arms, and the Zerma retreated to the frontier with the Baule (1895), where they founded Dares-Salam, their military and religious capital renamed Marabadiassa (Maraba Diassa &#x27;the citadel of the Zerma) by the Mandingo, from there they spread military expeditions and Islam in the region, they allied with the Baoulé to organize the slave trade and the arms trade (rifle, cannon). Having made the Baoulé country a protectorate and the Wassoulou Empire their allies, the Zerma rallied to Samori Toure and attacked the Senufo again .

The Zerma Empire in Senufo country was an imamate which covered the region of the Vallée du Bandama District, Mankono region, all on the lands of the Senufo Tagouana and Djimini, with the Baoulé country as a protectorate. The power of the Zerma army based on the use of rapid cavalry, rifle and cannon made it the most powerful ally of the Wassoulu Empire and the most powerful state of the late 19th century in the lands of the modern Ivory Coast.

=== Semassi Warriors of Togo and North West Benin (1875-1898) ===

Zarma riders and mercenaries, the &quot;Semassi&quot;&#x27;, are known for having operated on Togolese territory on behalf of slave traders between 1883 and 1887. After having been co-opted by the Tem, they kidnap children on the roads at the level of Fazao mountains, or further south, and place up to two or three of them on the same horse before fleeing.
The Zerma Warriors, who numbered 500 Horsemen equipped with rifle and cannon, built an great army by integrating the slaves they captured. Under the command of the Zerma Warlords, Mayakki Mongoro and Mayakki Maali, the Semassi in Togo had seized in 1875 to 1898, the regions of Savanes and Kara occupied by the Moba and Kabye, they made the Tem Tchaoudjo Kingdom located in the Centrale Region (Sokodé) a protectorate and pushed their conquests as far as Atakpamé. in Benin, Djougou was their protectorate and they incessantly raided the Tammari people of Atakora.
From 1890 to 1900 they had to bow to the projects and ambitions of the French and German colonial empires.

== Society and culture ==

The language, society and culture of the Songhai people is barely distinguishable from the Zarma people. Some scholars consider the Zarma people to be a part of and the largest ethnic sub-group of the Songhai. Some study the group together as Zarma-Songhai people. However, both groups see themselves as two different peoples.

===Social stratification===
The Songhai people have traditionally been a socially stratified society, like many West African ethnic groups, with castes. According to the medieval and colonial era descriptions, their vocation is hereditary, and each stratified group has been endogamous. The social stratification has been unusual in two ways; it embedded slavery, wherein the lowest strata of the population inherited slavery, and the &quot;Zima&quot;, or priests and Islamic clerics, had to be initiated but did not automatically inherit that profession, making the cleric strata a pseudo-caste.

Louis Dumont, the 20th-century author famous for his classic &quot;Homo Hierarchicus&quot;, recognized the social stratification among Zarma-Songhai people as well as other ethnic groups in West Africa, but suggested that sociologists should invent a new term for West African social stratification system. Other scholars consider this a bias and isolationist because the West African system shares all elements in Dumont&#x27;s system, including economic, endogamous, ritual, religious, deemed polluting, segregative and spread over a large region. According to Anne Haour, a professor of African Studies, some scholars consider the historic caste-like social stratification in Zarma-Songhay people to be a pre-Islam feature while some consider it derived from the Arab influence.

The different strata of the Songhai-Zarma people have included the kings and warriors, the scribes, the artisans, the weavers, the hunters, the fishermen, the leather workers and hairdressers (Wanzam), and the domestic slaves (Horso, Bannye). Each caste reveres its own guardian spirit. Some scholars such as John Shoup list these strata in three categories: free (chiefs, farmers and herders), servile (artists, musicians and griots), and the slave class. The servile group were socially required to be endogamous, while the slaves could be emancipated over four generations. The highest social level, states Shoup, claim to have descended from King Sonni &#x27;Ali Ber and their modern era hereditary occupation has been &quot;Sohance&quot; (sorcerer). Considered as being the true Songhai, the &quot;Sohance&quot;, also known as &quot;Si Hamey,&quot; are found primarily in The Songhai in the Tillabery Region of Niger, whereas, at the top social level in Gao, the old seat of the Songhai Empire and much of Mali, one finds the Arma who are the descendants of the Moroccan invaders married to Songhai women. The traditionally free strata of the Songhai people have owned property and herds, and these have dominated the political system and governments during and after the French colonial rule. Within the stratified social system, the Islamic system of polygynous marriages is a norm, with preferred partners being cross cousins. This endogamy within Songhai-Zarma people is similar to other ethnic groups in West Africa.

===Livelihood===
The Songhai people cultivate cereals, raise small herds of cattle, and fish in the Niger Bend area where they live. They have traditionally been one of the key West African ethnic groups associated with caravan trade.

Agriculture serves as the primary livelihood for the Songhai populations, adapted to the arid and semi-arid conditions in which they reside. The Sahel region experiences a three-month rainy season contrasted by a more extended dry period of eight to nine months. Irrigation is extensively used along the Niger river and in the Saharan oases. Notably, cereals dominate Songhai cultivation, with millet as the leading crop, followed by rice along the Niger River, wheat, and sorghum. Additionally, wild cereals such as panicum leatum or wild fonio are harvested seasonally. The Songhai cultivate diverse crops, including tobacco, onions, spices, tubers, and moringa. Among the Northern Songhai population in Tindouf, Tabalbala, and Ingal, date palms and Mangoes are the most widely cultivated fruits, followed by oranges, watermelons, melons, and gourds.

The Songhai employ various tools for agriculture, including plows pulled by an oxen and tools like the &quot;hilar&quot; (hoe) and pitchfork. In precolonial times, they utilized servile labor razziers, evolving with modernization to include tractors and combine harvesters. Agricultural workers, known as &quot;boogou,&quot; assist farmers with labor. After harvest, Songhai often allow Fulani and Tuareg herders, or their own cattle, to graze the fields, reflecting their preference for meat.

=== Animal husbandry ===
The Songhai engage also in animal hunt. Settlements and villages primarily raise cattle, goats (especially the Sahelian breed), sheep, poultry (especially guinea fowl), and donkeys. Camels are raised for both travel and consumption, particularly in regions like Zarmaganda, Gao, and Timbuktu.

Nomadic Idaksahak and Igdalen pastoralists are involved in large livestock breeding, traversing valleys such as Azawagh, Azgueret, Irhazer, and Tilemsi; the Gourma riverbanks; and the foothills of the Aïr Mountains and Adrar. Their herds consist primarily of camels, alongside goats, sheep, and oxen. Living in tents, they primarily consume dairy products.

The horse holds a central role in Songhai society, earning the region the moniker &quot;land of horses.&quot; Two distinct Songhai horse breeds, the Djerma (crossbreed of Dongola and Barb) and the war-prized Bagzan from the Aïr, showcase their expertise in horse breeding. Horse ownership in the Niger bend region rivals that of the Ethiopian plateau. The Songhai introduce their children to horses from adolescence, and in the past, noble families possess substantial horse quantities used for parades and field surveillance. Historically, guarding and maintenance of horses were entrusted to the most trustworthy captives, and villages used to organize horse racing competitions, notably on market days.

<doc id="624634" wikidata="Q2236939" url="?curid=624634" title="SEDOL">
<text>SEDOL stands for Stock Exchange Daily Official List, a list of security identifiers used in the United Kingdom and Ireland for clearing purposes. The numbers are assigned by the London Stock Exchange, on request by the security issuer. SEDOLs serve as the National Securities Identifying Number for all securities issued in the United Kingdom and are therefore part of the security&#x27;s International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) as well. The SEDOL Masterfile (SMF) provides reference data on millions of global multi-asset securities each uniquely identified at the market level using a universal SEDOL code.

==Description==
SEDOLs are seven characters in length, consisting of two parts: a six-place alphanumeric code and a trailing check digit. SEDOLs issued prior to January 26, 2004 were composed only of numbers. For older SEDOLs, those from Asia and Africa typically begin with 6. Those from the UK and Ireland (until Ireland joined the EU) typically begin with 0 or 3. Those from the rest of Europe typically began with 4, 5, or 7. Those from the Americas began with 2.

After January 26, 2004, SEDOLs were changed to be alpha-numeric and are issued sequentially, beginning with B000009. At each character position numbers precede letters and &quot;vowels are never used&quot;. All new SEDOLs, therefore, begin with a letter. Ranges beginning with 9 are reserved for end user allocation.

The check digit for a SEDOL is chosen to make the total weighted sum of all seven characters a multiple of 10. The check digit is computed using a weighted sum of the first six characters. Letters have the value of 9 plus their alphabet position, such that B = 11 and Z = 35. While vowels are never used in SEDOLs, they are not ignored when computing this weighted sum (e.g. H = 17 and J = 19, even though I is not used), simplifying code to compute this sum. The resulting string of numbers is then multiplied by the weighting factor as follows:

 + First 1 
 + Second 3 
 + Third 1 
 + Fourth 7 
 + Fifth 3 
 + Sixth 9 
 + Seventh 1 (the check digit)

The character values are multiplied by the weights. The check digit is chosen to make the total sum, including the check digit, a multiple of 10, which can be calculated from the weighted sum of the first six characters as (10−(weighted sum modulo 10)) modulo 10.

For British securities, SEDOLs are converted to ISINs by padding the front with two zeros, then adding the country code on the front and the ISIN check digit at the end.

JavaScript code for validating SEDOLs Code:

Modified from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/SEDOLs

function checkSedol(text){
 var weight = [1, 3, 1, 7, 3, 9, 1];
 try {
 var input = text.substr(0,6);
 var check_digit = sedol_check_digit(input);
 return text == input + check_digit;
 } catch(e) {
 return false;
 return false;
 function sedol_check_digit(char6) {
 if (char6.search(/^[0-9BCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ]{6}$/) == -1){
 throw &quot;Invalid SEDOL number &#x27;&quot; + char6 + &quot;&#x27;&quot;;
 var sum = 0;
 for (var i = 0; i &lt; char6.length; i++){
 sum += weight[i] * parseInt(char6.charAt(i), 36);
 var check = (10 - sum%10) % 10;
 return check.toString();
}
===Example===

BAE Systems: 0263494

The checksum can be calculated by multiplying the first six digits by their weightings:

: (0×1, 2×3, 6×1, 3×7, 4×3, 9×9) = (0, 6, 6, 21, 12, 81)

Then summing up the results:

: 0 + 6 + 6 + 21 + 12 + 81 = 126

The check digit is then calculated by:

: [10 − (126 modulo 10)] modulo 10 = (10 − 6) modulo 10 = 4 modulo 10 = 4

<text>John Van Denburgh (August 23, 1872 – October 24, 1924) was an American herpetologist from California (who also used the name Van Denburgh in publications, hence this name is used below).

==Biography==
Van Denburgh was born in San Francisco and enrolled at Stanford University in 1891. As of 1895, he organized the herpetology department of the California Academy of Sciences. In 1897, he received a Ph.D. from Stanford University and earned a M.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1902. Subsequently, he practiced medicine in San Francisco, while again serving as curator of the herpetological collections of the California Academy of Sciences.

After the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 he was instrumental in rebuilding the lost herpetology collections through new expeditions and also acquisitions of other collections. In 1922, he published the two-volume &quot;The Reptiles of Western North America&quot;.

He died in 1924 while on vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii.

==Taxa named by and in honor of Van Denburgh==
Van Denburgh discovered and described at least 38 species or reptiles in a series of papers and books published between 1895 and 1922.

Van Den Burgh is commemorated in the scientific names of one species and three subspecies of reptiles: &quot;Aspodoscelis tigris vandenburghi&quot;, &quot;Diadophis punctatus vandenburgii&quot;, &quot;Sceloporus graciosus vandenburgianus&quot;, &quot;Scincella vandenburghi&quot;, and &quot;Chelonoidis vandenburghi&quot;.

<text>Terence Martin Griffiths (16October 19471December 2024) was a Welsh professional snooker player, coach and pundit. After winning several amateur titles, including the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1975 and back-to-back English Amateur Championships in 1977 and 1978, Griffiths turned professional in June 1978 at the age of 30. 

In his second professional tournament, he qualified for the 1979 World Snooker Championship. He reached the final of the event where he defeated Dennis Taylor by 24 to 16. This was only the second time a qualifier had won the World Snooker Championship, after Alex Higgins in 1972; only Shaun Murphy in 2005 has since emulated the achievement. In 1988, Griffiths again reached the final of the competition. He was tied with Steve Davis, 8–8, but lost the match 11–18.

Griffiths reached at least the quarter-finals of the World Championship for nine consecutive years, from 1984 to 1992. He also won the Masters in 1980 and the UK Championship in 1982, completing snooker&#x27;s Triple Crown. Griffiths was runner-up at the Masters three times and reached the final of the 1989 European Open, where he lost the to John Parrott.

Although he also won several other tournaments, Griffiths&#x27;s determination to match his rival Davis led to changes in technique which commentators said cost him his natural flair for playing. He retired from the professional tour in 1996 to become the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association&#x27;s director of coaching. During his coaching career, he worked with leading players including Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams and Ding Junhui. Griffiths died in December 2024, aged 77.

==Early years==
Griffiths was born in Llanelli on 16 October 1947. He was admitted to a grammar school but was expelled for truancy and became a student at a secondary modern school, where he played rugby union with future Welsh national-team members Phil Bennett and Derek Quinnell. Griffiths began playing snooker when he was 14. After leaving school, he worked in a coal mine and became the youngest winner of the Llanelli and District snooker championship at age 16. Griffiths subsequently began working as a bus conductor, a job which gave him more time to practise. He later worked as a postman and as an insurance salesman.

At age 17, Griffiths won the West Wales snooker championship. When he was 18 and working as a bus conductor, he met Annette, and the couple married in 1969. They had their first son, Wayne, a year-and-a-half after their wedding, and their other son, Darren, two years later. Griffiths compiled his first century break at age 24, the first year he entered the Welsh Amateur Championship (where he was runner-up). Griffiths played in the amateur home internationals fourteen times, winning twelve of his matches; after winning the Welsh Amateur Championship in 1975, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1976 World Amateur Snooker Championship. He won the English Amateur Championship in 1977 by defeating Sid Hood 13–3 in the final, and retained the title in 1978 by winning 13–6 against Joe Johnson.

==Professional career==

===1978–1982===
Griffiths became a professional player on 1 June 1978 after he was accepted as a member by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) at its meeting during the 1978 World Snooker Championship. Anticipating his acceptance as a professional, &quot;Snooker Scene&quot; said in May 1978 that &quot;his power screws and long potting are second to no one&#x27;s ... it will not be in the least surprising, if very soon he becomes a serious challenger for snooker&#x27;s top professional titles.&quot;

In his first professional match, qualifying for the 1978 UK Championship, Griffiths lost 8–9 to Rex Williams after leading 8–2. Williams took a 2–1 lead; Griffiths won the next seven frames, and Williams took the following seven. In the , Griffiths rushed when potting the and went , a shot. Williams later potted the pink for the victory. After qualifying for the 1979 World Championship by eliminating Bernard Bennett 9–2 (from 0–2 behind) and Jim Meadowcroft 9–6 (from 6–6), Griffiths defeated the previous year&#x27;s runner-up Perrie Mans 13–8 in the first round and Alex Higgins 13–12 in the quarter-finals. After beating Eddie Charlton 19–17 in a long semi-final which finished at 1:40 am, Griffiths told interviewer David Vine: &quot;I&#x27;m in the final now, you know.&quot; In the final, he faced Dennis Taylor, who had been a professional since 1973 and was also playing in his first World Championship final. The match was close for the first four of the six and level at 15–15 before Griffiths took a 17–16 lead and won 24–16, becoming world champion at his first attempt in his second tournament as a professional. The result saw him placed eighth in the Snooker world rankings 1979/1980. He was the second player to win the championship after playing in qualifying competition (after Higgins in 1972), and the first to win it at the Crucible in Sheffield, the venue for the championship since 1977, as a qualifier. By 2021, the only other player to achieve this was Shaun Murphy in 2005. 

Griffiths reached the final of the 1979 Canadian Open the following season, losing 16–17 to Cliff Thorburn, and was part of the Welsh team that won the inaugural World Cup of snooker; Ray Reardon, Doug Mountjoy and Griffiths defeated England 14–3 in the final. At the end of 1979, Griffiths faced John Virgo in the UK Championship final. Virgo had been penalised two frames for arriving late to a session (not realising that the start time had been moved up as requested by the television broadcasters), which reduced his lead to 9–11. When the scores were 11–11, Griffiths offered to split the prize money. Virgo declined and went on to win the match, 14–13.

Griffiths was named the BBC Cymru Wales Sports Personality of the Year for 1979, and was the subject for a &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; episode the following year. He won the 1980 Masters, defeating Alex Higgins 9–5 in front of 2,323 spectators (a record crowd for a UK snooker event) at the Wembley Conference Centre after compiling a break of 131 to win the decisive frame. It was his first Masters appearance and his only Masters title, although he was runner-up at the event three times in the subsequent four years. He also won the 1980 Irish Masters, defeating Mountjoy 10–9 in the final.

Defending champion at the 1980 World Championship, Griffiths lost the first seven frames against Davis in his first match and ended the first session trailing 1–7. Davis won the opening frame of the second session to extend his lead to 8–1, and had a seven-frame lead again at 10–3 before Griffiths won three frames to end the session 6–10 behind. In the third session, Griffiths won the first four frames to level at 10–10; Davis won the next three for a 13–10 victory, which included a 116 break in the 22nd frame. With this first-round defeat, Griffiths became the first victim of the so-called &quot;Crucible curse&quot;, a term later adopted to describe the failure of any first-time champion to defend their title at the venue. He moved up three places in the annual rankings, to fifth for 1980/1981.

Griffiths and his Wales teammates retained the 1980 World Challenge Cup, and he again won the Irish Masters in 1981 before losing to eventual winner Davis in the quarter-finals of the 1981 World Snooker Championship. Griffiths lost 3–16 to Davis in the 1981 UK Championship final, the first of five finals in consecutive events contested by the pair. Griffiths won two of the five, winning 9–8 on the final black in the deciding frame of the 1982 Classic after Davis had recovered from 3–8 to 8–8. He also won the 1982 Irish Masters, his third consecutive title at the event, defeating Davis 9–5 in the final. After Tony Knowles&#x27;s surprise 10–1 win over Davis in the first round of the 1982 World Championship, Griffiths became the bookmakers&#x27; favourite for the title. However, Griffiths also exited in the first round, losing 6–10 to Willie Thorne. Despite this, he advanced again in the rankings, achieving third place, which would be his highest-ever ranking, in 1981/1982. He won the 1982 UK Championship at the end of the year, defeating Alex Higgins 16–15 in the final.

===1983–1989===
Griffiths won several further invitational events, including Pot Black in 1984, and the 1984 Malaysian Masters (where he topped a round-robin group in which Tony Meo was the runner-up). He also gained titles at the 1984 Singapore Masters, where he also topped a round-robin group in which Davis was the runner-up; and the 1985 Hong Kong Masters, where he defeated Davis 4–2. The 1985–86 snooker season saw Griffiths win the Welsh Professional Championship for the first time after defeating Mountjoy 9–4. He also won the 1986 Belgian Classic, where he saw off Kirk Stevens 9–7 in the final.
His ranking had dropped to fourteenth in 1982/1983 when his 1979 points were no longer counted towards his total, which at the time was calculated purely on the basis of results of the preceding three world championships. He improved to ninth rank in 1983/1984, and was eighth for both 1984/1985 and 1985/1986 before falling to tenth for 1986/1987.

Two months before the 1986 World Snooker Championship, Griffiths began working with coach Frank Callan. After eliminating Higgins 13–12 in the last 16, he praised Callan for helping his game: &quot;I tried to do the right things myself for three years... Frank has knitted it all together for me. I didn&#x27;t think anyone knew that much about snooker.&quot; He led eventual winner Johnson 12–9 in their quarter-final match, but Johnson won four consecutive frames, two with century breaks, for a 13–12 victory. He ended the season by winning the 1986 Pontins Professional, defeating Willie Thorne in the final.

Griffiths was the only player to reach the televised stages of each ranking tournament in the 1986–87 season, but did not reach the semi-finals in any of them. At the end of the season, he moved up four places in the rankings to sixth. He won the Welsh Professional Championship again in 1986, defeating Doug Mountjoy 9–3. In 1987, Griffiths opened a billiard hall: the Terry Griffiths Matchroom in Llanelli. The next year, he won the 1988 Welsh Professional Championship final 9–3 against Wayne Jones.

At the 1988 World Snooker Championship, Griffiths defeated Steve Longworth, Willie Thorne, Neal Foulds and Jimmy White to reach his second world final, but lost 11–18 to defending champion Davis. The players had been level at 8–8 after the first of two days&#x27; play in the final, and Terry Smith of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said after the match: &quot;Griffiths knows he produced his best snooker since he became world champion in 1979, and still lost.&quot; The 1989 European Open was his only final the following season. Although Griffiths won four of the first five frames, John Parrott tied the scores at 4–4 after the first session. Griffiths later led 8–7, but Parrott won the match (and his first major title) 9–8.

===1989–1997===
In the 1989–90 snooker season, Griffiths reached the semi-finals of the 1989 Asian Open and the 1989 UK Championship and the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Snooker Championship. His only final was in the 1989 Scottish Masters, where he lost 1–10 to Stephen Hendry. Griffiths dropped one place in the world rankings, to sixth, at the end of the season. The following season, he was again runner-up to Hendry at the Scottish Masters; he had little success in other ranking events, however, and fell from sixth to eleventh place at the season&#x27;s end.

Griffiths moved back into sixth place after the 1991–92 season, during which he reached three ranking semi-finals, including that of the 1992 World Championship, where he scored victories over Bob Chaperon, Neal Foulds and Peter Ebdon before losing to Stephen Hendry. His best performance at a ranking tournament the following season was the semi-final of the 1992 Grand Prix, which he lost 6–9 to Ken Doherty; his best showings at ranking tournaments over the next three seasons were a single quarter-final appearance in each.

At the 1996 World Snooker Championship, Griffiths eliminated Jamie Burnett 10–9 in a first-round final-frame decider after trailing 0–6 and 5–9. In the second round, he lost to old rival Steve Davis (whom he never defeated at the Crucible in six attempts) and announced his retirement from the game to become the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association&#x27;s Director of Coaching. Griffiths retired at 23rd in the rankings (the first year since his debut season that he had not been in the top 16). Clive Everton wrote that Griffiths was &quot;the only player to retire when his standard was still in touch with the circuit&#x27;s top players.&quot; 

At the 1997 World Championship, Griffiths came out of retirement, and won his qualifying match against Alfie Burden 10–4, to play in the main tournament at the Crucible one last time. He led fellow countryman Mark Williams 9–8, but lost the next two frames, each on the final , and was eliminated 9–10. During his professional career, he played a total of 999 frames at the Crucible.

In their book, &quot;Masters of the Baize&quot;, Luke Williams and Paul Gadsby wrote that Griffiths may have won more tournaments if he had not adjusted his playing technique to challenge Davis. Gordon Burn reported in his 1986 book, &quot;Pocket Money&quot;, that Ray Reardon felt that Griffiths began to decline as a player after he signed a management contract with Barry Hearn (Davis&#x27;s manager) at the end of the 1981–82 season and changes Griffiths made to his stance and cueing cost him his &quot;natural flair&quot;. Burn wrote that after Hearn became Griffiths&#x27;s manager, &quot;In the first year, Hearn tripled Griffiths&#x27;s income and halved his work.&quot; He quotes Griffiths: &quot;I just found it difficult to accept that there was a better player than me in the world&quot;, but &quot;I wasn&#x27;t even getting at Steve Davis, because other players were beating me first.&quot; Everton wrote about Griffiths&#x27;s change of technique, &quot;While he acquired an encyclopaedic technical knowledge in the process and maintained an admirable consistency, he could never quite recapture the flair and inspiration that had brought him the world title.&quot; As winner of the World Championship, UK Championship and Masters during his career, Griffiths achieved the snooker Triple Crown.

==Later career, retirement and death==
Griffiths resigned as the WPBSA director of coaching in 1998, describing the association as &quot;a hopeless set-up with no one giving the staff any direction at all.&quot; He coached a number of top players, including Mark Allen, Ali Carter, Ding Junhui, Marco Fu, Barry Hawkins, Stephen Hendry, Stephen Maguire, Joe Perry and Mark Williams. Griffiths said about his coaching that &quot;it used to be a lot of technical stuff years ago – probably 90% on the technical side. Now it&#x27;s the other way about, perhaps 80–20% on the mental side.&quot; He was the director of coaching at the South West Snooker Academy, and a snooker commentator for the BBC. 

Griffiths received an OBE appointment in 2007 for his &quot;services to snooker&quot;. He launched &quot;SQ&quot;, a handicapping system for snooker, in 2021. His son, Wayne Griffiths, is head snooker coach at the Hong Kong Sports Institute and has coached three-time women&#x27;s world champion Ng On-yee. During his career, Griffiths won over a million pounds in prize money. 

In 2024, his family announced that he had dementia. He died in his hometown of Llanelli, on 1 December 2024, at the age of 77.

<text>Edgar Parks Snow (July 19, 1905 – February 15, 1972) was an American journalist known for his books and articles on communism in China and the Chinese Communist Revolution. He was the first Western journalist to give an account of the history of the Chinese Communist Party following the Long March, and he was also the first Western journalist to interview many of its leaders, including Mao Zedong. He is best known for his book, &quot;Red Star Over China&quot; (1937), an account of the Chinese Communist movement from its foundation until the late 1930s.

==Background==
Edgar Parks Snow was born on July 19, 1905, in Kansas City, Missouri. Before settling in Missouri, his ancestors had moved to the state from North Carolina, Kentucky, and Kansas. He briefly studied journalism at the University of Missouri, and joined the Zeta Phi chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity.

==Career==
Snow moved to New York City to pursue a career in advertising before graduating. He made a little money in the stock market shortly before the Wall Street Crash of 1929. In 1928 he used the money to travel around the world, intending to write about his travels.

===China===
Snow arrived in Shanghai that summer and stayed in China for thirteen years. He quickly found work with the &quot;China Weekly Review&quot;, edited by J.B. Powell, a graduate of the Missouri School of Journalism. He became friends with prominent writers and intellectuals, including Soong Ching-ling, the widow of Sun Yat-sen and an advocate of reform. During his early years in China, he supported Chiang Kai-shek, noting that Chiang had more Harvard graduates in his cabinet than there were in Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s. He arrived in India in 1931 with an introduction letter to Nehru from Agnes Smedley, an American left-wing journalist living in China. He delivered it in Mumbai and Sarojini Naidu introduced him to her Communist sister Suhasini, who took him around to see mill workers. He met Gandhi in Simla, but was not impressed. He covered the Meerut conspiracy case trial in which three British communists were involved, and wrote three articles about India.

He began to make an international name for himself when he became correspondent for the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and widely traveled throughout China, often on assignment for the Chinese Railway Ministry. He toured famine districts in Northwest China, visited what would later become the Burma Road, and reported on the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.

In 1932 he married Helen Foster, who was working in the American Consulate until she could begin her own career in journalism. She and Snow hit upon the pen-name &quot;Nym Wales&quot; for her professional work. In 1933, after a honeymoon in Japan, Snow and his wife moved to Beiping, as Beijing was called at that time. They taught journalism part-time at Yenching University, the leading university, and studied Chinese, becoming modestly fluent. In addition to writing a book on Japanese aggression in China, &quot;Far Eastern Front&quot;, he also edited a collection of modern Chinese short stories (translated into English), &quot;Living China&quot;. They borrowed works on current affairs from the Yenching library and read the principal texts of Marxism. The couple became acquainted with student leaders of the anti-Japanese December 9th Movement. It was through their contacts in the underground communist network that Snow was invited to visit Mao Zedong&#x27;s headquarters.

===&quot;Red Star Over China&quot;===
In June 1936, Snow left home with a letter of introduction from Soong Ching-ling (who was a politically important supporter of the Communists) and arrived at Xi&#x27;an. The Communist-held areas were blockaded by Zhang Xueliang&#x27;s army, which had been forced out of his Manchurian base when the Japanese invaded in 1931, Zhang and his followers wanted to work with the Communists in order to oppose the Japanese and allowed Snow to enter. Snow was accompanied by George Hatem, who had worked with the Party, whose presence on the trip Snow did not mention for many years. Snow had been preparing to write a book about the Communist movement in China, and had even signed a contract at one point. However, his most important contribution was the interviews that he had conducted with the top leaders of the party. When Snow wrote, there were no reliable reports reaching the West about the Communist-controlled areas. Other writers, such as Agnes Smedley, had written in some detail about the Chinese Communists before the Long March, but none of these writers had visited them or even conducted interviews with the leadership which had emerged during the Long March.

Snow was taken through the military quarantine lines to the Communist headquarters at Bao&#x27;an, where he spent four months (until October 1936) interviewing Mao and other Communist leaders. He was greeted by crowds of cadets and troops who shouted slogans of welcome, and Snow later recalled &quot;the effect pronounced upon me was highly emotional.&quot; Over a period spanning ten days, Mao Zedong met with Snow and narrated his autobiography. Although Snow did not know it at the time, party leadership carefully prepared Mao for these interviews and edited Snow&#x27;s drafts. Snow claimed that he had been under no constraint, but made revisions in the book at the request of Mao, Zhou Enlai, and perhaps American communists who worried that Mao was creating splits in the International movement.

After he returned to Beijing in the fall, Snow wrote frantically. First he published a short account in &quot;China Weekly Review&quot;, then a series quickly translated into Chinese. &quot;Red Star Over China&quot;, published first in London in 1937, was an immediate best-seller. The book is given credit for introducing both Chinese and foreign readers not so much to the Communist Party, which was reasonably well known, but to Mao Zedong. Mao was not, as had been reported, dead. Snow reported that Mao was a sincere communist, a patriot committed to resisting the Japanese invasion and world-wide fascism, and a political reformer, not the purely military or radical revolutionary that he had been during the 1920s.

In the first four weeks after its publication, &quot;Red Star over China&quot; sold over 12,000 copies, and it effectively made Snow world-famous. The book quickly became a &quot;standard&quot; introduction to the early Communist movement in China. His literary agent in Japan, Yoko Matsuoka translated the book, as well as many of his other works, into Japanese.

===China during World War II===
After the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the Snows became founding members of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association (Indusco). The goal of Indusco was to establish workers&#x27; cooperatives in areas which were not controlled by the Japanese, through which Chinese workers would be provided with steady employment, education, consumer and industrial goods, and the opportunity to manage their own farms and factories. Snow&#x27;s work in Indusco mainly involved his chairmanship of the Membership and Propaganda Committee, which managed public and financial support. Indusco was eventually successful in creating 1,850 workers&#x27; cooperatives. Snow again visited Mao in Yan&#x27;an in 1939.

Snow reported on the Nanking Massacre (December 1937 to February 1938), and he even reported on Japanese reactions to it, stating: His report on the Nanking Massacre appeared in his 1941 book &quot;Scorched Earth&quot;.

Snow met Wataru Kaji, and his wife, Yuki Ikeda. Both Kaji and Ikeda survived a Japanese bombing attack on Wuchang and met him at the Hankow Navy YMCA. Snow met them again a year later in Chongqing and he was reminded that:

Japan was full of decent people like them who, if they had not had their craniums stuffed full of Sun goddess myths and other imperialist filth, and been forbidden access to &#x27;dangerous thoughts,&#x27; and been armed by American and British hypocrites, could easily live in a civilized co-operative world if any of us could provide one. 

His time reporting on the Second Sino-Japanese War would appear in his 1941 book &quot;The Battle For Asia&quot;.

===Later journalism===
Shortly before the United States entered World War II, in 1941, Snow toured Japanese-occupied areas of Asia and wrote his second major book, &quot;Battle for Asia&quot;, about his observations. After writing the book, Snow and his wife returned to the United States, where they separated. In April 1942, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; sent him abroad as a war correspondent. Snow traveled to India, China, and Russia to report on World War II from the perspectives of those countries. In Russia he shared his observations of the Battle of Stalingrad with the American Embassy. At times, Snow&#x27;s defenses of various undemocratic Allied governments were denounced as blatant war propaganda, not neutral journalistic observation, but Snow defended his reporting, stating:

In this international cataclysm brought on by fascists it is no more possible for any people to remain neutral than it is for a man surrounded by bubonic plague to remain &#x27;neutral&#x27; toward the rat population. Whether you like it or not, your life as a force is bound either to help the rats or hinder them. Nobody can be immunized against the germs of history. 

By 1944, Snow was wavering on the question of whether Mao and the Chinese Communists were actually &quot;agrarian democrats,&quot; rather than dedicated communists who were bent on totalitarian rule. His 1944 book, &quot;People On Our Side&quot;, emphasized their role in the fight against fascism. In a speech, he described Mao and the Communist Chinese as a progressive force which desired a democratic, free China. Writing for &quot;The Nation&quot;, Snow stated that the Chinese Communists &quot;happen to have renounced, years ago now, any intention of establishing communism [in China] in the near future.&quot; After the war, Snow retreated from the view that the Chinese communists were a democratic movement.

While working as a correspondent in Russia, he wrote three short books about Russia&#x27;s role both in World War II and world affairs: &quot;People on Our Side&quot; (1944); &quot;The Pattern of Soviet Power&quot; (1945); and, &quot;Stalin Must Have Peace&quot; (1947).

In 1949 Snow divorced Helen Foster and married his second wife, Lois Wheeler. They had a son, Christopher (born 1949) who died of cancer in October 2008, and a daughter, Sian (born 1951), named after the Chinese city Sian (now Xi&#x27;an), who lives and works as a translator and editor in the Geneva region, not far from where her mother lived for many years prior to her death in 2018.

===McCarthyism, exile===
Because of his relationships with communists and because of his highly favorable treatment of them when he was a war correspondent, Snow became an object of suspicion after World War II. During the McCarthy period, he was questioned by the FBI and he was also asked to disclose the extent of his relationship with the Communist Party. In published articles, Snow lamented about what he saw as the one-sided, conservative, and anti-communist mood in the United States. Later in the 1950s, he published two more books about China: &quot;Random Notes on Red China&quot; (1957), a collection of previously unused China material which was of interest to China scholars; and &quot;Journey to the Beginning&quot; (1958), an autobiographical account of his experiences in China before 1949. During the 1950s, Snow found it difficult to make a living through his writing, and he decided to leave the United States. He and his wife moved to Switzerland in 1959, but he remained an American citizen.

===Visits to China===
He returned to China in 1960 and 1964, interviewed Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, traveled extensively, and talked to many people. His 1963 book, &quot;The Other Side of the River&quot;, details his experience, including his reasons for denying that China&#x27;s 1959–1961 Great Leap Forward was a famine. In 1963, his new book was reviewed in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; which referred to his association with Rewi Alley, a New Zealander who by then was &quot;the Chinese Government&#x27;s chief propagandist in English.&quot;

In 1970, he – this time with his wife, Lois Wheeler Snow – made a final trip to China. On October 1, he stood next to Mao during the National Day parade in Beijing, the first time an American was given that honor.
In December 1970, Mao Zedong called Snow to his office one morning before dawn for an informal talk lasting over five hours, during which Mao told Snow that he would welcome Richard Nixon to China either as a tourist or in his official capacity as President of the United States.
Snow reached an agreement with Time magazine to publish his final interview with Mao, including the Nixon invitation, provided the earlier interview with Zhou Enlai was also published.
The White House followed this visit with interest but distrusted Snow and his pro-communist reputation. When Snow came down with pancreatic cancer and returned home after a surgery, Zhou Enlai dispatched a team of Chinese doctors to Switzerland, including George Hatem.

==Death==

Snow died on February 15, 1972, the week President Nixon was traveling to China, before he could see the normalization of relations. He died of cancer, at the age of 66, at his home in Eysins near Nyon, Vaud, Switzerland. After his death, his ashes were divided into two parts at his request. One half was buried at Sneden&#x27;s Landing, near the Hudson River. The other half was buried on the grounds of Peking University, which had taken over the campus of Yenching University, where he had taught in the 1930s. His final book, &quot;The Long Revolution&quot;, was published posthumously by Lois Wheeler Snow.

In 1973 Lois Wheeler Snow went to China to bury half of her husband&#x27;s ashes in the garden of Peking University. In 2000 – together with her son Chris – she traveled to Beijing in support of women who lost their children in the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. One of these mothers was under house arrest and refused visits by others, while another was arrested after receiving financial assistance from Wheeler Snow. Wheeler Snow issued statements of protest to the international press and threatened to remove her husband&#x27;s remains from Chinese soil. In her letter to the Chinese ambassador in Geneva, Wheeler Snow expressed her wish that the people of China be liberated from oppression, corruption and misuse of power – just as she and her husband had expressed in 1949.

==Evaluation by China scholars==
Snow&#x27;s reporting from China in the 1930s has been both praised as prescient and blamed for the rise of Mao&#x27;s communism. Some Chinese historians have judged Snow&#x27;s writing very positively. John K. Fairbank praised Snow&#x27;s reporting for giving the West the first articulate account of the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership, which he called &quot;disastrously prophetic.&quot; Writing thirty years after the first publication of &quot;Red Star Over China&quot;, Fairbank stated that the book had &quot;stood the test of time... both as a historical record and as an indication of a trend.&quot; Fairbank agrees that Snow was used by Mao, but defended Snow against the allegation that he was blinded by Chinese hospitality and charm, insisting that &quot;Snow did what he could as a professional journalist.&quot;

Other historians have been more critical of Snow. Jung Chang and Jon Halliday&#x27;s anti-communist biography, &quot;&quot;, describes Snow as a Mao spokesman and accuses him of supplying myths, asserting that he lost his objectivity to such an extent that he presented a romanticized view of communist China.

Jonathan Mirsky, a critical voice, stated that what Snow did in the 1930s was &quot;to describe the Chinese Communists before anyone else, and thus score a world-class scoop.&quot; Of his reporting in 1960, however, he says that Snow &quot;went much further than those who reckoned that Mao and his comrades would take power.&quot; He contented himself with assurances from Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong that while there was a food problem, it was being dealt with successfully,&quot; which &quot;was not true&quot;, and &quot;had Snow still been the reporter he had been in the 1930s he would have discovered it.&quot;

In &quot;&quot;, a work sympathetic to Mao, Lee Feigon criticizes Snow&#x27;s account for its inaccuracies, but praises &quot;Red Star&quot; for being &quot;[the] seminal portrait of Mao&quot; and relies on Snow&#x27;s work as a critical reference throughout the book.

<text>A collaboration tool helps people to collaborate. The purpose of a collaboration tool is to support a group of two or more individuals to accomplish a common goal or objective. Collaboration tools can be either of a non-technological nature such as paper, flipcharts, post-it notes or whiteboards. They can also include software tools and applications such as collaborative software.

== Early computer-based collaboration tools==
The first idea to use computers in order to work with each other was formed in 1945 when Vannevar Bush shared his thoughts on a system he named &quot;memex&quot; in his article &quot;As We May Think&quot;. A system that stores books, records and communications of an individual and makes them available at any time. At this stage he called it &quot;an enlarged supplement to his memory&quot;.

=== Computerized office automation ===
In 1968 computer systems were brought in connection with communication and the potential way of working together when not at the same place by Dr. J. C. R. Licklider, head of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In his article &quot;The Computer as a Communication Device&quot;, he envisioned the idea that there should be a way of &quot;facilitating communication among people without bringing them together in one place&quot;, which eventually led to ARPANET, commercial time-sharing systems and finally the Internet.

When the microcomputer was invented in 1970, everyone learned about office automation, which led to the first collaborative software called Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) that allowed to do surveys, threaded replies and group-structured approaches. In 1991 educator C. A. Ellis came up with the definition of the term &quot;groupware&quot; as &quot;computer-based systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) and that provide an interface to a shared environment&quot;. Paul Wilson then shaped the term &quot;computer-supported cooperative work&quot; (CSCW). He described it as &quot;a generic term which combines the understanding of the way people work in groups with the enabling technologies of computer networking, and associated hardware, software, services, and techniques&quot;.

This laid the foundation to develop further on the ideas of groupware and in the 1990s Lotus Notes, Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook were invented. In 2002 at the Social Software Summit Clay Shirky introduced the phrase “social software” as a &quot;software that supports group interaction&quot;.

== Main types ==
Three aspects of collaboration: communication, coordination and cooperation can be used to categorize collaboration tools.

=== Communication ===
Communication tools provide exchange of information between individuals:

====E-Mail====

The invention of email as a collaboration tool changed the way we used to communicate in the workplace. It is the easiest method to make contact within an organization and is well established. Especially for organizing daily correspondence, email can reach various people with just one click.

Although email is still the most common used tool in communication collaboration it is not very efficient on a big scale and other forms of communication seem to take over. Besides its flexibility it is not very good for group conversations as they grow too fast. There is no way to be sure that a person has the latest version of a document that has been sent to them and it is impossible to always track via their email what tasks need to be done and by which deadline. As Cisco states in their Cisco Blog about the &quot;Future of Email&quot;, emails &quot;will improve productivity by organizing your data for you&quot; and try to bring more transparency in their work with email.

==== Voicemail ====
Voicemail as a collaboration tool is more and more integrated in services such as Google Voice. As pointed out in an IBM future scenario the role of voicemail could be that of what email is for us today.

==== Instant messaging (IM) ====
Through instant messaging as a collaboration tool we are able to reach people within an organisation in real-time. In the future instant messaging is not a stand-alone software anymore, but very well integrated in bigger solutions such as Unified Communication.

==== VoIP (voice over IP) / video call ====
Voice over IP as a collaboration tool has quickly gained popularity among companies and is part of their communication portfolio. As a report from Eclipse Telecom is pointing out, the VoIP is moving towards the state to totally replace our telephones in our offices and also integrate in existing collaboration service environments.

=== Coordination ===
Coordination is defined as &quot;the deliberate and orderly alignment or adjustment of partners’ actions to achieve jointly determined goals&quot;. Collaboration tools supporting this are the ones who allow a person to set up group activities, schedules and deliverables.

==== Online calendars ====
Online calendars are part of professional behaviour at work and fully integrated in other systems. As a research paper from University of Bath explains, online calendars could in the future be much closely linked to other data such as social media and have even a larger effect.

==== Time-tracking software ====
Time trackers are especially used to measure the performance of employees. Its effect on productivity is discussed as being controversial.

==== Spreadsheets ====
Spreadsheets are like emails very popular within the corporate environment and as a collaboration tool essential for financial analysis or modelling. Although very popular, several studies found out that many spreadsheets contain inaccurate data and are therefore inefficient.

=== Cooperation ===
Cooperation tools allow groups to have real-time discussions and to shape an idea or thought together. Trends in terms of collaboration target on helping to maintain the &quot;main idea&quot; within big organizations and make connections visible. Also the idea of bringing people who are not working in a company on a regular basis into the organization and make use of their knowledge.

==== Video conferencing ====
In most cases video conferencing is part of the overall communication and collaboration strategy of organisations. Especially now when all services are cloud-based and therefore implementation costs became more affordable. The longterm vision for video conferencing lies in the correct usage of computer processing power, data storage or mobile bandwidth speeds to further decrease the obstacles of collaboration.

==== IM teleconferencing ====
Bringing teams, meetings or events as close as possible is what teleconferencing solutions want to do. Apart from business environments Teleconferencing is currently used in a variety of fields, such as telemedicine, where they contribute enormously to the efficiency and productivity as distance and time are limited factors.

== Classification based on dimensions ==

=== Asynchronous collaboration tools ===
A collaboration tool is asynchronous when its users are collaborating at a different time:

==== E-Mail, mailinglists and newsgroups ====

E-Mail is the best known asynchronous collaboration tool and the most common used - it offers intuitive features for forwarding messages, creating mailing groups and attaching documents. Furthermore, information can be automatically chronologically sorted and assigned to tasks or calendar events.

==== Group calendar ====

Through group calendars meetings can be scheduled, projects managed and people coordinated. It is a great tool to help a person overlook their deliverables and deadlines. A group calendar includes functions such as the detection of conflicting schedules with other people in a team or organization or coordination of meeting times that suit everybody in a team. Besides the positive effects of group calendar there is also controversy about privacy and control that might influence a person&#x27;s productivity.

==== Workflow systems ====

With workflow systems files or documents can be communicated to the organization by following a strict and organised process. They provide services for routing, development of forms and support for roles. As current workflow systems are controlled from one point, individuals within an organization normally do not have the permission to manage their own processes so far - this should be changed by implementing collaborative planning tools to current workflow systems.

==== Hypertext ====

Hypertext technology connects our files to each other and makes sure that always the latest version is available to us. When people work on different documents the system automatically updates the information of other people.

=== Synchronous collaboration tools ===

A collaboration tool is synchronous, when its users are collaborating at the same time:

==== Shared whiteboards ====

Shared whiteboards give its users the capability to work efficiently on a task through a web-based platform. They can be used for informal discussions and also for communications that need structure, involve drawing or are in general more sophisticated. This might also be very useful in to realise virtual classrooms.

==== Video communication systems ====

Video communication systems offer two-way or multi-way calling with a live videostream. It can be best compared to a telephone system with an additional visual element.

==== Chat systems ====

Chat systems allow people to write and send messages in real-time. They are usually structured in chat rooms which show usernames, number of people, location, discussion topic and more.

==== Decision support systems ====

Decision support systems support groups to manage the decision making process. They give people the ability to exchange their brainstorming, analyzing their ideas and even are used for voting. Decision making is becoming more and more a core function of modern work. According to studies 50% of organizational decisions fail.

==== Multiplayer video games ====

Computer games are a good example of how a multi-user situation could look like in the future. They are constantly developed and expanded with features such as chat and video systems.

== Online Collaboration Tools ==
Online collaboration tools are web-based applications that offer basic services such as instant messaging for groups, mechanisms for file sharing and collaborative search engines (CSE) to find information distributed within the system of the organization, community or team. Additionally, the functionality is sometimes further expanded by providing for example integrated online calendars, shared online-whiteboards to organize tasks and ideas or internet teleconferencing integrations. The focus of online collaboration tools ranges from simple to complex, inexpensive to expensive, locally installed to remotely hosted and from commercial to open source.

=== Background ===
New gadgets and devices are invented every day with the goal in mind to make our daily work easier. Online collaboration tools currently try to tackle problems like these:

* &#x27;38% of employee time is lost duplicating work and 58% of people waste an hour a day looking for information&#x27;.
* &#x27;28 hours a week is spent on writing e-mails, searching for information and collaborating internally&#x27;.
* &#x27;59% of managers miss vital information because they cannot find it or never see it&#x27;.
* &#x27;Six weeks per year are wasted by executives searching for lost documents&#x27;.

These aspects point out that the problem we are facing is not a technological problem - it is about people and their interactions. Although technology really helps us in this way, the key to solve these problems can be found in the way how we use these tools. Although video conferencing tools such as Skype or FaceTime connect us with everyone, they do not always give us all the contextual information. What we see might not be the reality, as there might be other people in the room that one does not know about while skyping with one&#x27;s colleagues at work. More connectivity also allows more interruption: A person can work from home but is always interrupted by their neighbours or the lawnmower. This is why the future of collaboration tools looks for models that allow companies to collaborate in a focused and structured manner. One such application is the Finnish company Fingertip Ltd, which enables companies to facilitate collaboration and decision making.

=== Evolvement ===
==== From simple communication solutions to Unified Communications (UC) ====
The way we communicate with each other is constantly changing and disrupts our workplace environment. In 1971 programmer Ray Tomlinson sent the first message between two computers. Eight years later Usenet, a multi-network online forum, changed the way how we exchange information. With IRC in 1986, instant-messaging and group chatting became accessible for non-technical users for the first time and after the launch of AOL/AIM in 1992 we already faced the first global community. The invention of Wikipedia in 2001 and various social networks (MySpace, Linkedin and Facebook) forms a community that is connected to the digital world, globally oriented and willing to use collaboration tools not only for social interaction, but to enhance the efficiency at the workplace.

==== From local to global - the needs of a global workforce ====
Apart from enhancing our efficiency, online collaboration tools face the change that organizations operate globally and the application of flexible working becomes even more important. Collaborative working environments are one of the drivers of the corporate globalization as they offer new business opportunities through innovation and help to and allow to collect knowledge from all over the world. Especially SME’s and large organizations are capable to do business on a global scale by using them. Since 1950 the intensity of collaboration has extremely risen, the flow of information has become faster and the needed skills to carry out work has dramatically increased. Online collaboration tools therefore enable companies to survive in their globally oriented industries.

IBM conducted a study with CIO’s of organizations to find out which trends will most affect business in 2010, coming up with six main points:
# The participatory internet
# Changing workforce demographics
# The rise of software as a service
# The virtualization of data and devices
# Increasing of simplicity of technology’s design and use
All of these points are stressing the importance of collaboration and define certain requirements for the future of online collaboration tools in order to consistently enable a wide business collaboration. Online collaboration tools such as social networking websites and web conferencing are demonstrating how fast the environment is changing – “by 2010, the average salaried worker will actively participate in at least five different ad hoc teams simultaneously”.

When asking participants of “The New Global Study”, a report done by the European Commission in 2009, about the benefits of online collaboration, the following three points were mentioned most:
# Supports coordination within a team (73% of respondents)
# Supports knowledge and learning (69%)
# Allows dispersed team-members to be a better part within the team

<text>Pierre &quot;Perrie&quot; Mans (25 October 1940 – 13 September 2023) was a South African professional snooker player. He first won the South African Professional Championship in 1965 and lifted the title 20 times. Mans won the Benson &amp; Hedges Masters in 1979 and reached the final of the World Championship in 1978.

==Background==

Mans&#x27; father, Peter Mans, who died in 1975, was also a professional snooker player, making the quarter-finals of the 1950 World Snooker Championship.

==Snooker career==

Mans won the South African Amateur Championship in 1960, the only occasion in which he competed in the event. He then turned professional and took the South African Professional Championship from Fred Van Rensburg in 1965.

Mans first entered the World Snooker Championship in 1970. His first victory in the Championship came in the 1973 event when he defeated Ron Gross 9–2 before losing 8–16 to Eddie Charlton. However, in 1974, he pulled off a major surprise by defeating John Spencer 15–13 in the second round, before being defeated by Rex Williams in the quarter-final 4–15. In the 1976 event, he defeated Graham Miles 15–10 and Jim Meadowcroft 15–8 to reach the semi-final where he lost 10–20 to defending champion Ray Reardon.

In 1977, he was invited to take part in BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Pot Black&quot; programme which he duly won at his first attempt beating Fred Davis, Ray Reardon and Willie Thorne (over single frames) before defeating Doug Mountjoy 90 points to 21 in the final. During the final he also took the highest break prize with an effort of 59.

His career peaked in 1978, when he reached the final of the world championships, losing 18–25 to Ray Reardon. During that championship he defeated reigning Champion John Spencer 13–8, before achieving wins over Graham Miles (13–7) and Fred Davis (18–16). In the final, he never led Reardon, but held him to 17–18, before Reardon pulled away. He reached number two in the world rankings as a result; at that time rankings were based purely on the world championships of the three previous seasons.

1978 also saw Mans win the Heidelberg 100 event, defeating Silvino Francisco 9–3 in the final. This same year brought him greater company in the South African professional ranks when Silvino Francisco, Mannie Francisco, Jimmy van Rensberg, Derek Mienie and Roy Amdor all turned professional.

Mans&#x27; most notable tournament success was the Benson and Hedges Masters in 1979, beating Cliff Thorburn 5–4, Ray Reardon 5–3 and, in the final, Alex Higgins 8–4, winning the competition with a top break of just 48.

In January 1980, Mans defeated Bill Werbeniuk 3–0 and John Spencer 3–2 before losing 2–4 to Alex Higgins in the final of the Padmore/Super Crystalate International event held at the Gala Baths, West Bromwich.

In January 1981, he pulled off the shock of the season by defeating strong favourite Steve Davis 5–3 in the first round of the 1981 Masters event, compiling a highest break of just 36. Mans lost 4–5 to Cliff Thorburn in the quarter-final.

In the 1982 World Championship, he defeated Tony Meo in the first round. Meo led 3–0, but Mans overtook him to lead 9–8. This looked likely to become 9–9 when Mans trailed 54 points to 0 in the penultimate frame. However, Mans then completed a clearance of 62 to win frame and match. He went on to lose 6–13 in the next round to Jimmy White.

Mans&#x27; last victory at the Crucible Theatre came in 1983 when he defeated Scottish debutant Ian Black 10–3, compiling breaks of 57, 65 and 69. However, an in-form Kirk Stevens defeated Mans 13–3 in the second round, a defeat which put Mans outside the top 16 in the world rankings.

Mans last played in the World Championship in 1986. He defeated Les Dodd 10–7 in the final qualifying round but despite holding Doug Mountjoy to 3–4, he lost his first round match 3–10. Earlier in the season he had partnered Australian John Campbell to the quarter-final of the Hofmeister World Doubles, where they lost just 4–5 to Ray Reardon and Tony Jones.

Mans played in only two ranking events the following season (and the world doubles), failing to win any matches he slumped to fiftieth in the world rankings. He announced his retirement from professional snooker in July 1987 at the age of 46. After thss, he ran a business in Johannesburg, importing snooker accessories.

In 1997, Mans returned briefly to the UK snooker scene after a twelve-year hiatus, participating in the &quot;Seniors&quot; Pot Black special on BBC2 timed to coincide with the 1997 World Championship, which marked the 20th anniversary of the tournament being held at the Crucible Theatre. At 57, Mans lost to eventual winner Joe Johnson. Mans returned again to play in the seniors event in the autumn of 2000, losing his first match 82 points to 13 to Canadian Jim Wych.

==Playing style==

A left-hander, Mans was famous for his long powerful pots, as well as his fashionable waistcoats.

==Death==

Perrie Mans died on 13 September 2023, at the age of 82.

<doc id="624670" wikidata="Q2142393" url="?curid=624670" title="Power nap">
<text>A power nap or cat nap is a short sleep that terminates before deep sleep (slow-wave sleep; SWS). A power nap is intended to quickly revitalize the sleeper.

A power nap combined with consuming caffeine is called a stimulant nap, coffee nap, caffeine nap, or nappuccino.

==Characteristics==
A power nap, also known as a Stage 2 nap, is a short slumber of 20 minutes or less which terminates before the occurrence of deep slow-wave sleep, intended to quickly revitalize the napper. The expression &quot;power nap&quot; was coined by Cornell University social psychologist James Maas.

The 20-minute nap increases alertness and motor skills. Various durations may be recommended for power naps, which are short compared to regular sleep. The short duration prevents nappers from sleeping so long that they enter the slow wave portion of the normal sleep cycle without being able to complete the cycle. Entering deep, slow-wave sleep and failing to complete the normal sleep cycle, can result in a phenomenon known as sleep inertia, where one feels groggy, disoriented, and even sleepier than before beginning the nap. In order to attain optimal post-nap performance, a Stage 2 nap must be limited to the beginning of a sleep cycle, specifically sleep stages N1 and N2, typically 18–25 minutes.

Experimental confirmation of the benefits of this brief nap comes from a Flinders University study in Australia in which 5, 10, 20, or 30-minute periods of sleep were given. The greatest immediate improvement in measures of alertness and cognitive performance came after the 10 minutes of sleep. The 20 and 30-minute periods of sleep showed evidence of sleep inertia immediately after the naps and improvements in alertness more than 30 minutes later, but not to a greater level than after the 10 minutes of sleep. Power naps are effective even when schedules allow a full night&#x27;s sleep.

==Research==
===Potential benefits===
Power naps intend to restore alertness, performance, and learning ability. A nap may also reverse the hormonal impact of a night of poor sleep or reverse the damage of sleep deprivation. A University of Düsseldorf study found superior memory recall once a person had reached 6 minutes of sleep, suggesting that the onset of sleep may initiate active memory processes of consolidation which—once triggered—remains effective even if sleep is terminated.

According to clinical studies among men and women, power nappers of any frequency or duration had a significantly lower mortality ratio due to heart disease than those not napping. Specifically, those occasionally napping had a 12% lower coronary mortality, whereas those systematically napping had a 37% lower coronary mortality.

A Flinders University study of individuals restricted to only five hours of sleep per night found a 10-minute nap was overall the most recuperative nap duration of various nap lengths they examined (lengths of 0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, and 30 minutes): the 5-minute nap produced few benefits in comparison with the no-nap control; the 10-minute nap produced immediate improvements in all outcome measures (including sleep onset latency, subjective sleepiness, fatigue, vigor, and cognitive performance), with some of these benefits maintained for as long as 155 minutes; the 20-minute nap was associated with improvements emerging 35 minutes after napping and lasting up to 125 minutes after napping; and the 30-minute nap produced a period of impaired alertness and performance immediately after napping, indicative of sleep inertia, followed by improvements lasting up to 155 minutes after the nap.

The NASA Ames Fatigue Countermeasures Group studied the effects of sleep loss and jet lag, and conducts training to counter these effects. A major fatigue countermeasures recommendation consists of a 40-minute nap (&quot;NASA nap&quot;) which empirically showed to improve flight crew performance and alertness with a 22% statistical risk of entering SWS.

For several years, scientists have been investigating the benefits of napping, both the power nap and much longer sleep durations as long as 1–2 hours. Performance across a wide range of cognitive processes has been tested. Studies demonstrate that naps are as good as a night of sleep for some types of memory tasks.

A NASA study led by David F. Dinges, professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, found that naps can improve certain memory functions. In that NASA study, volunteers spent several days living on one of 18 different sleep schedules, all in a laboratory setting. To measure the effectiveness of the naps, tests probing memory, alertness, response time, and other cognitive skills were used.

Power Napping Enablers and sleep timers allow properly timed power napping.

One study showed that a midday snooze reverses information overload. Reporting in &quot;Nature Neuroscience&quot;, Sara Mednick, PhD, Stickgold and colleagues also demonstrated that &quot;burnout&quot; irritation, frustration and poorer performance on a mental task can set in as a day of training wears on. This study also proved that, in some cases, napping could even boost performance to an individual&#x27;s top levels. The NIMH team wrote: &quot;The bottom line is: we should stop feeling guilty about taking that &#x27;power nap&#x27; at work.&quot;

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied the effects of socioeconomic status on short sleep durations. In this 2007-2008 CDCP study, 4,850 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) produced self-reported sleep durations. It was suggested through this study that individuals with minority status and a lower ranking in socioeconomic position are more inclined to have shorter self-reported sleep durations.

Longer and more frequent daytime naps appeared to be associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia in a study that tracked 1401 older people over 14 years. Links have also been proposed between these types of naps and cardiovascular disease, though the evidence is largely inconclusive. A series of studies by the medical journal Sleep demonstrated that people who nap for an hour or more a day had 1.82 times the rate of cardiovascular disease than people who didn&#x27;t nap.

==Stimulant nap==

A stimulant nap is a brief period of sleep of around 15 minutes, preceded by consuming a caffeinated drink or another stimulant.

It may combat daytime drowsiness more effectively than napping or drinking coffee alone. A stimulant nap is more effective than regular naps in improving post-nap alertness and cognitive functioning. In a driving simulator and a series of studies, Horne and Reyner investigated the effects of cold air, radio, a break with no nap, a nap, caffeine pill vs. placebo and a short nap preceded by caffeine on mildly sleep-deprived subjects. A nap with caffeine was by far the most effective in reducing driving accidents and subjective sleepiness as it helps the body get rid of the sleep-inducing chemical compound adenosine. Caffeine in coffee takes up to half an hour to have an alerting effect, hence &quot;a short (&lt;15min) nap will not be compromised if it is taken immediately after the coffee.&quot; One account suggested that it was like a &quot;double shot of energy&quot; from the stimulating boost from caffeine plus better alertness from napping. This procedure has been studied on sleep-deprived humans given the task of driving a motor vehicle afterwards, although it has not been studied on elderly populations.

==Nap rooms and tech aided naps==

Some companies have nap rooms to allow employees to take power naps. This may be in a form of a nap room with a recliner, or chairs specially designed for power napping installed in a designated area. Companies with nap rooms say that employees are happier and become more productive at work.

Similar nap rooms and stations also exist in higher education institutions. Many colleges and universities provide napping furnitures such as cots and beanbags in libraries for students to take naps after long periods of study. At least one university has a nap room set up in a gym. Some medical schools also set up nap rooms at teaching hospitals. The nap rooms may include sleeping pods or cots, white noise machines, and antimicrobial pillows.

In Barcelona, there is a café called Nappuccino that implements custom-built napping pods inside the café.

A more portable aid is a nap timer app. Apps have various features including aided sounds, nap history and pattern tracking and daily reminders that make it easier to take naps.

<doc id="624674" wikidata="Q935875" url="?curid=624674" title="John Spencer (snooker player)">
<text>John Spencer (18 September 1935 – 11 July 2006) was an English professional snooker player. One of the most dominant players of the 1970s, he won the World Snooker Championship three times, in 1969, 1971 and 1977. He worked as a snooker commentator for the BBC from 1978 to 1998 and served for 25 years on the board of the sport&#x27;s governing body, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), including a stint as chairman from 1990 until his retirement from the board in 1996.

Born in Radcliffe, Lancashire, Spencer started playing snooker on a full-sized table at age 14 and compiled his first century break aged 15. He was conscripted for National Service at age 18 and lost interest in playing snooker for over ten years before taking it up again in 1964. He reached the final of the English Amateur Championship for three years in a row, claiming the title at his third attempt in 1966. He turned professional in 1967—the same year as his amateur rivals Gary Owen and Ray Reardon—and won the world title as a debutant at the 1969 World Snooker Championship, which was staged as a knockout tournament for the first time since 1957, following a series of challenge matches from 1964 to 1968. Spencer defeated Owen 37–24 in the final to become the first World Champion of snooker&#x27;s . His title defence in 1970 ended with a 33–37 loss in the semi-finals to Reardon, the eventual winner.

He secured his second world title at the 1971 World Championship in Sydney, Australia, defeating Warren Simpson 37–29 in the final to become the first player to win the world title at a knockout event staged overseas. He reached the final again in 1972 but lost 31–37 to Alex Higgins. He won his third world title in 1977, beating Cliff Thorburn 25–21 in the final to become the first player to win the World Championship at Sheffield&#x27;s Crucible Theatre, where the tournament has been staged annually ever since. Spencer&#x27;s other notable victories include the inaugural Masters in 1975, where he defeated Reardon on a in the of the final, the inaugural Irish Masters in 1978 and three editions of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pot Black&quot; series. In 1979, he became the first player to compile a maximum break at a professional tournament, although it was not recorded as an official maximum because the on the table had not been measured against the required specifications.

One of the first major professional players to use a two-piece , Spencer was noted for his unusual cue action and immense . His later career was severely affected by the ocular version of myasthenia gravis, which was first diagnosed in 1985 and had symptoms including double vision. He made his last Crucible appearance at the 1986 World Championship, losing 7–10 to Higgins in the first round. His last notable achievement in professional play was reaching the quarter-finals of the 1987 British Open at age 51, where he lost 3–5 to Jimmy White. He retired from professional competition in 1992 because of ill health, but continued to perform in exhibition matches and served as chairman of the WPBSA for another four years. Diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2003, he died in a hospice near Bolton on 11 July 2006, aged 70. The trophy for the World Seniors Masters tournament was named in his memory in 2018.

==Early years and amateur snooker career==
John Spencer was born on 18 September 1935 at Bealey Maternity Home in Radcliffe, Lancashire, the youngest child of William Spencer, a night watchman and bookkeeper&#x27;s runner, and his wife Annie, &quot;née&quot; Bleakley. He attended Stand Grammar School for Boys in Whitefield. He first played snooker on a makeshift table using tape for cushions and nails to mark out the pockets, before being introduced by his father to playing snooker on a full-sized table when aged 14. He compiled his first century break at age 15. He was conscripted to National Service at age 18.

After completing three years of compulsory service in the RAF, Spencer tried out various jobs, including labourer, van driver and betting shop settler, and showed no interest in playing snooker for over ten years. Reintroduced to the sport by an old friend, he opted to take up snooker again at the age of 29. His first tournament was the 1964 English Amateur Snooker Championship, where he finished runner-up to Ray Reardon; the following year, he lost to Pat Houlihan in the final of the same event. Spencer lifted the trophy at his third attempt, in 1966, after an 11–5 victory over Marcus Owen in the final.

He married Margot Sawbridge in 1969. The couple separated in the 1980s, but did not divorce and remained good friends for the rest of Spencer&#x27;s life.

==Professional snooker career==
===1967–1971: First two world titles===
Spencer took on professional status in February1967, becoming the first UK player to do so since Rex Williams in 1951. Spencer was encouraged to turn professional because of the income he could expect to earn from performing regular exhibition matches for the National Spastics Society at £14 a time (), and at Pontins holiday camps during the summer season for a weekly fee of £20, to be increased to £50 a week the following year. His amateur rivals, Gary Owen and Reardon, turned professional in September and December1967, respectively.

In 1957, the professional world snooker title had passed to John Pulman, and he had retained it through a series of challenge matches from 1964 to 1968. After touring snooker clubs in promotion of the tobacco brand John Player, Pulman had secured sponsorship from the company for his world title challenge against Eddie Charlton in March1968. The good attendances for this match led to John Player&#x27;s decision to sponsor the 1969 World Championship as a knockout format tournament. Four of the eight entrants—Spencer, Reardon, Gary Owen and Bernard Bennett—were World Championship debutants; the other four—Pulman, Williams, Fred Davis and Jackie Rea—had played professionally since at least the 1950s. For the entry fee, Spencer took out a bank loan of £100 (). He was drawn against Pulman, the defending champion, whom he had recently defeated 17–14 in a non-title challenge match. In November1968, Spencer eliminated Pulman 25–18 in the opening match of the tournament, before defeating Williams 37–12 in the semi-finals.

The best-of-73- final between Spencer and Owen was held at Victoria Halls in London, from 17 to 22 March 1969. Spencer developed a 6–2 lead in the first , but Owen took the next four frames to level the match at 6–6. The correspondent for the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot; praised the players for bringing a &quot;refreshing new look to the game, with bold attacking play, wonderful potting and a sprinkling of good-sized breaks&quot;. Both players missed easy at the start of the second day, sharing the first two frames for 7–7; Spencer won the next four to lead 11–7 by the interval, and added four of the subsequent six frames to extend his lead to 15–9. Maintaining his six-frame advantage, he ended the third day&#x27;s play 21–15 ahead. Owen closed slightly to 19–23 on the fourth day, but Spencer then won four of the six frames in the evening session to end the day six frames ahead again, at 27–21. By the close of play on the fifth day, he was just one frame from victory at 36–24. Spencer took the opening frame on the final day to claim the world title with a winning margin of 37–24. His prize money was £1,780 ().

Snooker historian Clive Everton later wrote of Spencer&#x27;s performance in the 1969 World Championship final:

At the 1970 World Championship, Spencer defeated the veteran Irish Professional Champion, Jackie Rea, 31–15, but then lost his semi-final 33–37 to Reardon, who claimed his first world title. The 1971 World Championship was in fact held in late 1970, and took place in Sydney, Australia. After surviving an incomplete round-robin stage, Spencer decisively eliminated Reardon 34–15 in the semi-finals before defeating Warren Simpson 37–29 in the final to regain the world title. During the final match, he compiled three century breaks over the course of four frames. Between 1969 and 1978, the only three players able to defeat Spencer in World Championship matches were Reardon, Higgins and Perrie Mans; and from 1973 to 1977, he did not lose a match at the World Championship by more than two frames.

Spencer gained some valuable TV exposure by appearing on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pot Black&quot; series. He won the tournament in 1970—reversing his defeat by Reardon in the 1969 final—and again in 1971, when he beat Fred Davis in the final. He claimed the highest break prize in 1972, finished runner-up to Graham Miles in 1974, and won again in 1976, becoming the first three-time Pot Black champion. In 1971 and 1972, he appeared in four events sponsored by Park Drive cigarettes, known collectively as the Park Drive 2000. Each separate event featured four invited professionals who took part in a triple round-robin contest (playing nine matches each), and the top two players then competed in a final match. Spencer won three of the Park Drive events and reached the final of the fourth, narrowly losing 3–4 to Reardon. In 1971, he won the Stratford Professional with a 5–2 victory over David Taylor.

===1972–1976: The resurgence of snooker in Britain===
The 1972 World Championship final was pivotal in the rise of snooker as one of Britain&#x27;s most popular sports. Defending his second world title, Spencer eliminated Fred Davis 31–21 and Charlton 37–32, before facing championship debutant Alex Higgins in the final. Dominic Sandbrook wrote in 2019 that the final was contested under &quot;risibly ramshackle conditions&quot;. The spectators were seated on wooden boards supported on beer barrels. There was a miners&#x27; strike in progress at the time, giving rise to power shortages; in the absence of normal power, the first evening session was conducted with reduced lighting provided by a mobile generator. The week-long final was closely balanced until Higgins won the Thursday evening session 6–0, creating a gap in the scores that Spencer seemed unlikely to overcome. Higgins proceeded to take the match 37–31.

Spencer made no excuses for his defeat, even though he was feeling exhausted and ill after a major tour of Canada, had been trapped in a lift ahead of one of the sessions, and involved in a minor car crash on the way to another. In his 2005 memoir, he pointed out that he thought Higgins had produced the better snooker in the 1972 world final and had won the match &quot;fair and square&quot;. He was also willing to accept that Higgins&#x27;s win had attracted more sponsorship and promotions, and a greater degree of media interest than if he himself had won the championship. Later the same year, Spencer relinquished another of his titles to Higgins, losing 3–6 in the final of the Stratford Professional tournament.

In 1973 and 1974, the British insurance company Norwich Union sponsored an invitational snooker tournament containing a mix of professional and amateur players. Spencer won both events: in 1973, he defeated Higgins 8–2 in the semi-finals and Pulman 8–7 in the final; and in 1974, he beat Cliff Thorburn 9–7 in the semi-finals and Reardon 10–9 in the final. His 1974 victory came weeks after his had been broken into several pieces in a traffic collision and had needed to be repaired. He was runner-up in the two inaugural Pontins events, which both took place in 1974. He lost the Open final 4–7 to amateur Doug Mountjoy, having conceded a handicap of 25 per frame (due to his professional status), and was runner-up in the Professional event to Reardon, after recovering from 4–9 behind to force a . A further sign of snooker&#x27;s growing popularity came when sports betting company Ladbrokes held a gala evening at London&#x27;s Café Royal towards the end of 1973, to celebrate the firm&#x27;s £8,000 investment into the sport in the 1973–74 season. Spencer took the £150 first prize with a 3–2 win over Ray Edmonds. In late 1974, he won the Jackpot Automatics tournament (a minor eight-player invitational) with a 5–0 of Higgins in the final.

Spencer&#x27;s good form during this period was not translated into a third world title. At the 1973 World Championship, after showing decisive form in defeating David Taylor 16–5 and Williams 16–7, he lost by a single frame to Reardon in the semi-finals, 22–23; in 1974, after suffering from a dose of influenza, he lost his opening match 13–15 to Mans (whom he next met at the World Championship in 1978 with the same outcome). Spencer won the 1974 &#x27;plate&#x27; competition—for those knocked out in the first and second rounds of the main tournament—and recorded six centuries in the process of defeating David Greaves 5–1, Dennis Taylor 9–4, Jim Meadowcroft 9–3, and Pulman 15–5 in the final.

In January 1975, Spencer won the inaugural Masters event, held at the West Centre Hotel in Fulham, West London. He eliminated Pulman 5–3 and Charlton 5–2, before defeating Reardon 9–8 in the final. After trailing 6–8, Spencer levelled at 8–8 and took the deciding frame on a . Early the same year, he won the invitational Ashton Court Country Club event, defeating Higgins 5–1 in front of a sellout crowd in the final, as well as taking the highest break prize. He lost 2–5 to Higgins in the final of the Castle Open pro-am, held at Bernard Bennett&#x27;s Castle Club in Southampton at the end of the year.

There was a degree of controversy over Spencer&#x27;s elimination from the 1975 World Championship. With the tournament staged in Australia and organised by Charlton, Spencer found himself in the same half of the draw as both Reardon and Higgins, meaning that all of the previous World Champions since 1969 were in one half of the draw and Charlton was in the other. Additionally, Spencer was placed eighth in the organisational seedings, which resulted in his meeting Reardon in the quarter-finals. At the time, both players considered it to be the best match they had yet played against one another, but despite recording two centuries in the first four frames and leading 17–16, Spencer lost the match 17–19. The following year, Spencer experienced an even narrower defeat at the same stage in the 1976 World Championship. After eliminating David Taylor 15–5, and making the highest break of the tournament, 138, in the process, he lost to Higgins in the quarter-finals 14–15. He won the Canadian Open later the same year, defeating John Virgo 9–4 in the semi-finals and Higgins 17–9 in the final to claim the $5,000 prize.

===1977–1980: Third world title and first unofficial 147 break===
Spencer won his third world title in 1977, the first year that the World Snooker Championship was held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Seeded eighth, he defeated Virgo 13–9 (having trailed 1–4 earlier in the match), Reardon 13–6, Pulman 18–16, and Thorburn 25–21 (recovering from an 11–15 deficit) in the final, to claim the winner&#x27;s prize of £6,000. This was the last time he would seriously challenge for the world title, and he never again progressed beyond the last-16 stage of the tournament. He followed his World Championship victory by winning the Pontins Professional title, defeating Pulman 7–5 in the final. In September, he again faced Higgins in the final of the Canadian Open, but lost his title 14–17. The tournament was played inside a &quot;big top&quot; circus tent, alongside a traditional circus setup. The conditions were so hot and humid that an accumulation of moisture inside Spencer&#x27;s breast pocket caused his chalk to snap in half when he tried to use it.

In the spring of 1978, he won the inaugural Irish Masters at Goffs Sales Room in County Kildare, beating Mountjoy 5–3 in the final. He was undefeated in the group stages of the Pontins Professional tournament, winning all five of his matches, before losing 2–7 to Reardon in the final. Spencer warmed up for the 1978 World Championship by winning the Castle Club Professional event, with a 5–3 victory over Higgins in the final. However, he lost his opening World Championship match to Mans, 8–13, despite earlier compiling a 118 break to develop a 3–1 lead. After beginning the final session with a break of 138—which later proved to be the highest of the championship—he then failed to win another frame. The high break prize doubled Spencer&#x27;s total earnings from the tournament to £1,000.

In January1979, at the Holsten Lager International, Spencer completed the first ever 147 maximum break in tournament play. Having already taken the first three frames of his quarter-final match against Cliff Thorburn, he compiled a maximum in the fourth. Thames Television were resting their TV crew after filming the previous match between Alex Higgins and David Taylor, so the historic moment was not captured by the TV cameras. Although documented as the first maximum break at a tournament, Spencer&#x27;s 147 remains unofficial because it could not be verified; the tables at the event had that were not checked against specification using official templates. Spencer won the tournament, defeating Rex Williams 6–2 in the semi-finals and Graham Miles 11–7 in the final. As well as his £3,500 first prize, the sponsors awarded Spencer an additional £500 for the unofficial maximum. Three years later, on 11 January 1982, when Steve Davis made the first televised 147 break at the Lada Classic tournament in Oldham&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Hall, Spencer was his onlooking opponent. The maximum was compiled in the fifth frame of their quarter-final match when the scores had been poised at two frames each.

In February1979, Spencer won the Garware Paints Invitational event in Bombay, which at the time was the biggest tournament yet staged in India. He defeated India&#x27;s Arvind Savur 6–1, Patsy Fagan 6–4, Miles 6–5, and Thorburn 6–3 in the final, to take the £2,000 first prize and another £200 for the highest break (108), also claiming the &#x27;Man of the Series&#x27; award. He reached the semi-finals of the Irish Masters in early 1979, losing 2–3 to Reardon, after making the highest break of the tournament (121) at the group stage. He was runner-up in the 1979 Forward Chemicals Tournament, an extended event that used the old Park Drive 2000 format; Spencer lost to Reardon in the final 6–9. In January1980, at the first of two Wilson&#x27;s Classic invitational events, Spencer won £3,000—which at the time was a record for a two-day event. Broadcast by Granada TV, the final included a incident declared by the referee, Jim Thorpe, against Spencer&#x27;s opponent Higgins, who was fined £200 for his reaction to the controversial decision. Spencer also won the 1980 Winfield Australian Masters, beating Dennis Taylor on aggregate in the final.

===1981–1986: Later years and declining health===
Spencer&#x27;s 10–9 first-round victory over Edmonds at the 1981 World Championship was his first success at the tournament since claiming the title in 1977. He lost to Reardon in the second round, 11–13, after leading 3–0 and 7–5. This was the last time the two players faced each other in a World Championship match. In 1981, Spencer was part of the first English team to win the World Cup. Crucially, he defeated Terry Griffiths in the final with the aid of a 103 break, the Welsh player having not lost any of his matches prior to that stage in the competition. Steve Davis then secured victory against Reardon in the tie-break to win the title and the £12,000 prize money. Spencer paired up with Reardon for the first two World Doubles Championships. In 1982, they lost 2–6 to Jimmy White and Tony Knowles in the quarter-finals; and in 1983, they lost 0–5 to Thorburn and Virgo, also in the quarter-finals. The partnership ended when Spencer believed he would be unable to play in the 1984 event due to problems with his vision, and advised Reardon to seek another playing partner. However, a few days later Spencer felt that his medication had improved his symptoms sufficiently that he could play, and he partnered with Knowles, whose own former team-mate White had decided to ally with Higgins.

In April1982, in the semi-finals of the Highland Masters in Inverness, Spencer achieved a 6–0 whitewash against Higgins (who lifted the world title just four weeks later), before losing 4–11 to Reardon in the final. Spencer took the highest break prize with an effort of 119. That year&#x27;s World Championship produced a number of upsets and the loss of the top three seeds in round one. Despite a strong performance in defeating John Dunning 10–4 in the first round, Spencer was unable to profit from the more open draw. After keeping pace with Willie Thorne 3–3 in round two, his form deteriorated and he lost the match 5–13. At the end of 1982, Spencer finally won a match in the UK Championship, having lost in the first round every year since the inaugural tournament in 1977. He defeated Eddie Sinclair 9–8 and eliminated Knowles 9–6, before losing to Higgins 5–9 in the quarter-finals.

In 1983, Spencer defeated Reardon 5–3 and David Taylor 5–2 in the first two rounds of the Lada Classic, securing a cheque for £6,000 (equal to the amount he had received for winning the 1977 World Championship). In the semi-finals, he led Steve Davis 3–1, then 4–2, and gained a 45–29 advantage in the deciding frame, but Davis clinched the match. At the 1983 World Championship, Spencer eliminated Mike Hallett 10–7 in the first round before facing Charlton in the second. After taking a 4–0 lead, his intensity waned and, despite a break of 106, he allowed Charlton to pull ahead 12–7. Spencer fought back to win four consecutive frames but, on the verge of levelling at 12–12, he went and subsequently lost the match 11–13.

Spencer&#x27;s later career was blighted by the ocular version of myasthenia gravis, with symptoms including double vision. He first noticed a problem when he felt unwell at the Pontin&#x27;s Professional tournament in 1984. He later wrote that when the news broke in the press about his condition, only two players sent personal messages to him; one was Thorburn, the other Higgins, who turned up at Spencer&#x27;s house with a bottle of Bacardi rum but drank it himself as Spencer was not allowed any alcohol at this stage.

He failed to secure the 1984 Pontins Professional title, losing 7–9 to Willie Thorne in the final. During the 1984 World Championship, he defeated Miles 10–3 in the first round and held top seed Steve Davis to 4–6 in round two, before falling behind and losing 5–13. The Miles match was Spencer&#x27;s last victory at the Crucible. He won only one ranking match during the 1984–85 season, when he whitewashed Frank Jonik 6–0 in the Dulux British Open. He narrowly lost in the 1984 Pot Black final to Griffiths. Spencer&#x27;s condition made him susceptible to eye strain under bright TV lighting; when he competed in the 1985 Pontins Professional event under ordinary shaded lighting, he once again reached the final, but lost 7–9 to Griffiths. This would prove to be his last notable tournament final.

Ahead of the 1986 World Championship, Spencer journeyed to Scotland for some concentrated practice which helped him to qualify for the main stage of the tournament, where he met Higgins in the first round. Higgins led 8–2 and eventually won by a reduced margin at 10–7. This was the last time Spencer appeared at the Crucible as a participant in the World Snooker Championship. Sports writer Gordon Burn relates that part of Spencer&#x27;s time practising in Scotland included playing a young Stephen Hendry. After two money-match defeats, Spencer had proposed that they wear casual clothes for the next match, to which Hendry agreed, and Spencer subsequently won their third encounter 6–4. Hendry told his father afterwards that he thought he had been set up, saying knew that if I was dressed casually, I&#x27;d play casually.&quot;

===1987–1997: Retirement and final years===
After falling to a career-low 34th in the world rankings for the 1986–87 season, Spencer made a break of 129 in defeating Terry Whitthread 5–2 at the British Open in February 1987. In the final stages of this event, he defeated then-World Champion Joe Johnson 5–3 to reach the quarter-finals. He compiled a century in his last-eight match against White, and captured the sixth frame after requiring six snookers. Despite losing the match 3–5, Spencer enjoyed his highest ever snooker payday with a cheque for £9,000 (). He achieved a 5–0 victory over Fred Davis in the 1988 British Open, followed by a 5–0 win over Dennis Taylor, but lost 4–5 in the fifth round to Rex Williams.

Spencer used steroids to reduce the symptoms of his illness, but their effectiveness was inconsistent. He eliminated Ken Owers 10–8 in the 1990 World Championship qualifiers, before proving a tough test in the fourth round for rising star James Wattana, who sealed a 10–8 victory by winning the penultimate frame on the final black and the last frame on the pink. At the 1991 World Championship, he lost 4–10 to Ray Edmonds in his first qualifying match, giving Edmonds a long-awaited victory over Spencer in a rivalry that stretched back to the 1965 English Amateur Championship.

Despite indicating a strong desire to keep playing into the 1991–92 season, and stating an intention to enter all of the events on the calendar, Spencer was too ill to compete in the first six events after a worsening of his condition in June 1991. He kept his playing hopes alive by joining the management group of Six Colours Promotions in February 1992, hoping that this might provide him with a much-needed &#x27;morale boost&#x27;. Also involved was then-World Champion John Parrott, whom Spencer had advised ahead of his successful 1991 World Championship campaign. Although well enough to play in the remaining four ranking events of the season, he was only able to win a single frame (against Euan Henderson in the British Open). In his last appearance at the World Championship in 1992, he scored just 207 points against Bjorn L&#x27;Orange in the second round of qualifying, losing the match 0–10.

Spencer retired from professional competition in 1992, but continued to perform in exhibition matches. In his 2005 autobiography, he expressed his gratitude to Stephen Hendry&#x27;s manager, Ian Doyle, for arranging some exhibitions for him after he had stepped down as chairman of the WPBSA. He then began to have trouble with the veins in his legs, leading to problems with mobility. He took part in Seniors Pot Black in 1997, losing to Dennis Taylor. Spencer later wrote that he had been suffering from severe depression caused by his illness at the time of this particular match.

== Playing style and legacy ==
Professional snooker was dominated in the 1970s by two rival players: Spencer and Reardon. Spencer played down talk of a friendship between the two, and stated that they never socialised together. He referred to Reardon as &quot;the sort of person who could laugh 24 hours a day if it was to his advantage.&quot;

Spencer was one of the first major professional snooker players to use a two-piece cue, and the first to win the World Championship with a two-piece (in 1977). This particular cue was given to him by Al Selinger of the Dufferin Cue Company during Spencer&#x27;s victorious run in the 1976 Canadian Open. He chose not to make immediate use of the new cue but began using it in the run-up to the 1977 World Championship. He changed his cue again a few months later, this time opting for a two-piece made in Japan.

Spencer&#x27;s cue action included an unusually long backswing which gave him immense , allowing him to develop long-distance shots using deep and maximum . Everton wrote that in his early career, Spencer &quot;had an attractive, attacking style based on long potting, prodigious screw shots[...] and the kind of confidence usually seen only in a much younger man.&quot; Williams and Gadsby commented that Spencer was distinctive for his &quot;immense zest for the sport and his perfection of a stroke few could master – the deep screw shot&quot;, and his &quot;fine judgement of lethal long-range pots, a tactic[...] considered fairly risky at the time and nothing like as common as it is today.&quot; Spencer&#x27;s obituarist in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that despite his cue power, &quot;his unflappable temperament was perhaps his greatest asset.&quot;

In 2018, the WPBSA announced that the World Seniors Masters trophy was being named the &quot;John Spencer Trophy&quot; in his memory.

==Non-playing career and personal life==
In 1973, Cassell published Spencer&#x27;s instructional book, &quot;Spencer on Snooker&quot;, in which he also gave his opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of other leading professional snooker players. A revised version, edited by Everton, was published in 1986 as &quot;Snooker&quot; in the Teach Yourself book series.

Following his defeat by Mans in the 1978 World Championship, Spencer was invited by producer and &quot;Question of Sport&quot; creator Nick Hunter to try his hand at snooker commentary for the BBC, a task that he enjoyed for the next 19 years. He featured in a televised pro-am golf show in 1980, and guested on the quiz show &quot;Pot the Question&quot; on BBC1 in 1984. He opened a snooker club in Bolton called &quot;Spencer&#x27;s&quot; in 1985, and another in the same town the following year. In 1987, he and his wife Margot agreed to separate after 18 years of marriage.

Spencer appeared in three episodes of the snooker-themed show &quot;Big Break&quot;—in 1991, 1992, and 1997. Despite his poor health, he chaired the WPBSA for seven years; he resigned in November1996, completing a 25-year tenure on the governing board. Poor health also led to his departure from the role of commentator in 1998. In his memoirs, he recalled struggling through the role before retiring back to his hotel room, and he related that he was deeply moved by the kindness of fellow commentators Ted Lowe and Ray Edmonds.

Diagnosed with stomach cancer in early 2003, Spencer refused to undergo chemotherapy, choosing to enjoy the rest of his life without its side effects. He attended the Crucible in May2005 for the Parade of Champions, which took place before the final session of the 2005 World Championship final. Despite his ill health, he took part in a sponsored parachute jump in 2005 to raise funds for the Myasthenia Gravis Association. The same year, his autobiography &quot;Out of the Blue – Into the Black&quot; was published. Everton concluded his review of the book with: &quot;After a long spell of obscurity, Snooker needed new heroes and in that small cast he was at the forefront. He has an honourable place in Snooker&#x27;s history.&quot;

Spencer&#x27;s later years were spent with his new partner, Jean Shepherd, while he also remained amicable with his wife Margot. He died on 11 July 2006 in a hospice near Bolton, aged 70, from the effects of stomach cancer.

<text>Newton Mearns ( ) is a suburban town and the largest settlement in East Renfrewshire, Scotland. It lies southwest of Glasgow City Centre on the main road to Ayrshire, above sea level. It has a population of approximately 26,993, stretching from Whitecraigs and Kirkhill in the northeast to Maidenhill in the southeast, to Westacres and Greenlaw in the west and Capelrig/Patterton in the northwest.

It is part of the Greater Glasgow conurbation. Its name derives from being a new town of the parish of Mearns (from Scottish Gaelic &quot;maoirne&quot;, meaning a stewartry).

== History ==
Until the 20th century, the land around Newton Mearns was primarily agricultural. Ownership passed from the Pollocks (whose name is perpetuated in the nearby Glasgow housing estate of Pollok) to the Maxwells of Caerlaverock around 1300. It then passed to the Maxwells of Nether Pollok in 1648 and then the Stewarts of Blackhall in 1660. A new road from Eastwood Toll, now the main Ayr Road, was constructed in 1832. By the end of the 18th century quarrying had developed and more importantly numerous textile mills and finishing works became established availing themselves of the numerous rivers and lochs for water supply. The 1893 &#x27;Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland&#x27; describes it as &quot;pleasantly situated on a rising ground 410 feet above sea-level&quot;. It also reveals that it was a &#x27;burgh of barony&#x27; which bestowed the right to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs. However, the &quot;Gazetteer&quot; also describes the village as being only a &quot;single street on the Glasgow and Kilmarnock highroad&quot;.

From the early 20th century, with the introduction of improved roads and railways to the area, it gradually became a growing commuter suburb of Glasgow. In the 1930s, between speculative and local authority housing ventures, a further 6,000 houses were added to the area and after a lull during the war years, in the 1950s, house building began again in earnest. Unfortunately, the old core village suffered neglect during and after World War II and was all but derelict by the 1960s. It was purchased and turned into a shopping centre which was later to become &#x27;The Avenue at Mearns&#x27; in 1990.

Historical buildings in the area include the 15th century Mearns Castle, Greenbank House owned by the National Trust for Scotland (just inside neighbouring Clarkston) and the 1813 Mearns Kirk.

===Pollok Castle===
Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division (GUARD) undertook work on the Pollock Castle site, and history in 2000.
The castle appears to be noted by Pont&#x27;s sixteenth-century map. The castle was demolished and rebuilt as a large stately house 1686 by Sir Robert Pollok. It was completely destroyed by fire in 1882 (after remaining empty for some while) and then rebuilt again shortly after in the Scottish Baronial style. It was finally abandoned in the 1940s and fell into ruin. Some of the ruins were dynamited in the 1970s and a large prefabricated house erected on the castle foundations. The prefabricated house was removed and the site cleared in the early 1990s, and the castle was again rebuilt in 2003, in the Scottish Adam style. Some of the original foundations and castle walls remain.

== Governance ==
At national level, Newton Mearns forms part of the Eastwood constituency (since renamed to its original name of &quot;East Renfrewshire&quot;), and historically, it was one of Scotland&#x27;s safest Conservative seats in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. From the 1997 general election, when Barrhead and Neilston were added to the constituency, until 2015 the seat was held by Labour. In the 2015 election it was gained represented by the SNP&#x27;s Kirsten Oswald, but in 2017 general election it was gained by the Conservative Paul Masterton. Oswald regained the seat in the 2019 general election.

Newton Mearns forms part of the Eastwood constituency in the Scottish Parliament. The seat was held by Labour&#x27;s Ken Macintosh from 1999, when the parliament reconvened, until 2016. In 2016, Jackson Carlaw MSP, won the seat for the Conservatives.

Following the breakup of Strathclyde Regional Council in 1996, Newton Mearns became part of the new East Renfrewshire Council area.

On several occasions, Glasgow City Council has applied to the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland to have Newton Mearns re-allocated to its control.

=== Councillors ===
As a result of the introduction of the Single Transferable Vote system for Scottish local council elections, it was planned that, in time for elections taking place in and after 2007, the town would be divided into two multi-councillor wards: &quot;Liboside and Newton Mearns North&quot; and &quot;Newton Mearns South&quot;. However, due to a number of complaints about the new divisions, the former was renamed &quot;Neilston, Uplawmoor and Newton Mearns North&quot;, in a move to keep Neilston an integral part of the council. The current councillors for the areas are as follows:

==== Newton Mearns North and Neilston ====
====Newton Mearns South and Eaglesham====
== Economy ==

Newton Mearns is primarily a residential area, with most of its inhabitants travelling by car or public transport to Glasgow for employment and shopping. However, there are a number of small businesses in the area, as well as an indoor shopping centre.

The Avenue Shopping Centre is the main large retail centre in Newton Mearns. It comprises a total of 44 stores, currently including two supermarkets, three banks, nine clothing stores, food shops, restaurants and a library. The line of the main shopping area in the Avenue runs the course of the old Mearns Main Street. There are also shopping units and restaurants at Broom on the Ayr Road, shopping units and restaurants at Broomburn on the Mearns Road, and shopping units and restaurants at Crookfur on Harvie Avenue. The newly constructed Greenlaw Village close to the M77 at Crookfur Road also has two supermarkets, a hotel, smaller shops and a number of restaurants.

The 120 homes in the Hugh Fraser Retirement Estate have been fitted with smart technology and sensors, giving residents control of heating, lighting and doorbells using Amazon Alexa, its first use in an assisted living setting for a Scottish retirement community.

Farming continues to be important to the south of Mearns Cross and stretching to Fenwick and Eaglesham Moors. A major Bleach Works and textile finishing centre was constructed at Netherplace. The empty building was demolished in 2016 after it was the source of a major fly infestation across Newton Mearns and Clarkston. The site where the building was is visible from the M77 motorway.

== Transport ==

Traffic through the town&#x27;s A77 or Ayr Road was reduced significantly after the M77 motorway extension opened in 1997. Transport links improved further in May 2006 with the opening of the Glasgow Southern Orbital dual carriageway, and its connection to the M77.

As well as minor and major roads, the town has bus links with the centre of Glasgow, Kilmarnock, and Ayr. The town is served by two local train stations, Patterton and Whitecraigs which run trains to Glasgow Central station amongst others.

In November 2023 the minister and &quot;the vast majority of elders &amp; many in the congregation of Maxwell Mearns Castle Church&quot; ceded from Maxwell Mearns Parish Church (on theological grounds) to form Newton Mearns Free Church, in the process of affiliating with the Free Church of Scotland. 

The town is home to around 25% of Scotland&#x27;s entire Jewish community.

A public swimming pool and leisure centre is located at Eastwood Park in nearby Giffnock, and the swimming pool and sports centre at Eastwood High School is open to the public. Between Mearns and Barrhead lie the former reservoirs and water runs of the Gorbals Water Works, pioneered in the 19th century, before the building of the Loch Katrine Water Works. The reservoirs and surrounding parklands now form the Dams to Darnley Country Park.

<doc id="624678" wikidata="Q7990274" url="?curid=624678" title="Wey and Arun Canal">
<text>The Wey and Arun Canal is a partially open, canal in the southeast of England. It runs southwards from the River Wey at Gunsmouth in Shalford, Surrey to the River Arun at Pallingham, in West Sussex. The canal comprises parts of two separate undertakings – the northern part of the &quot;Arun Navigation&quot;, opened in 1787 between Pallingham and Newbridge Wharf, and the &quot;Wey and Arun Junction Canal&quot;, opened in 1816, which connected the Arun at Newbridge to the Godalming Navigation near Shalford, south of Guildford. The Arun Navigation was built with three locks and one turf-sided flood lock. The Junction Canal was built with 23 locks

Passing through a rural landscape, there was little freight traffic to justify its continued existence – the canal was officially abandoned in 1871. Without maintenance, the canal gradually became derelict over much of its length.

However, since 1970, restoration by The Wey &amp; Arun Canal Trust has led to several miles being restored to the standard navigable by narrowboats and small tour barges. Work is continuing, with the ultimate aim of reopening the entire canal to navigation.

==Arun Navigation==

The River Arun was used in an unimproved condition for centuries, but work was carried out on the river itself and the port of Arundel in the 16th century, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham Quay against the north of the parish of Pulborough by 1575. The act of Parliament, the Arun, Sussex Navigation Act 1785 (25 Geo. 3 c. 100), entitled &quot;&quot;, received royal assent on 13 May 1785.
Houghton Bridge was the absolute tidal limit; Newbridge lay much closer south-west of foundry-rich Billingshurst than to Pulborough. The route involved a new artificial cut of alongside the river, crossing the river by an aqueduct on three strong brick arches at Lordings Lock before its north end.

Completed in 1787, an undershot waterwheel of a design unique in British waterways was built into the aqueduct. Driven by the flow of the river this had scoops on the back of the blades which raised some water into the canal.

A shortcut cut was added in 1790 from Coldwaltham to Stopham, including a tunnel under Hardham Hill, which avoided the meander of the parish of Hardham (facing the south of Pulborough), saving .

The route from Newbridge down to Houghton became with six locks. The river continues a further to the sea at Littlehampton.

The last barge to ascend between Pallingham to Newbridge was recorded in 1888. Hardham tunnel closed in 1889. The cuts were officially abandoned in 1896, but some traffic continued on the old by-river cuts into the 20th century, notably bricks from Harwoods Green below Pallingham and chalk from Houghton Bridge; most south coastal traffic was stopped in 1938 by a new, fixed bridge on the Havant to Brighton railway line at Ford.

==Wey and Arun Junction Canal==
The first scheme to link the Wey and the Arun was proposed in 1641. Headwaters of the rivers were apart, and a canal to bridge them down to a navigable upper reach was submitted as a bill to Parliament, but was dropped when it reached the committee stage. Another scheme, to tie in, additionally, the Adur and Mole was suggested in 1663, but was not pursued.

In 1810, the 3rd Earl of Egremont began to promote the idea of a canal to link the Wey and Arun, the case being they were separated by . Part of the justification for this canal through these overwhelmingly rural counties, with few of the cargoes which made canals profitable, was to provide an inland route from London to Portsmouth and the south coast of England, an important consideration as England was at war with France and thus coastal shipping at risk of attack.

Josias Jessop (son of the more well known William Jessop) was appointed consulting engineer in 1811. It was his first job as an independent consulting engineer since he had established his reputation constructing Bristol Harbour. He made an estimate of £72,217 for construction of the canal, which he increased to £86,132 in May 1812, when he re-surveyed the route and part of it was changed. A survey was carried out in 1811 by Francis and Netlam Giles for an alternative, long, from the Croydon, Merstham and Godstone Railway at Merstham to Newbridge, via Three Bridges, Crawley and Horsham. A petition was presented to Parliament, but the scheme got no further.
An act of Parliament, the (53 Geo. 3. c. xix), received royal assent on 19 April 1813, entitled &quot;An Act for making and maintaining a navigable Canal, to unite the Rivers Wey and Arun, in the counties of Surrey and Sussex&quot;. This authorised the construction of the canal from the Godalming Navigation (an extension of the River Wey) near Shalford, south of Guildford to the northern terminus of the Arun Navigation at Newbridge. May Upton was appointed resident engineer in July, and work began. Jessop designed all the main structures, including aqueducts, bridges, locks and cottages for the lock-keepers. The canal was long, had 23 locks and was suitable for 30-ton barges. Construction was completed in September 1816, having cost £103,000.

By the time it was opened, however, the war with France was over and thus one of the key reasons for its construction was removed. As a result, it was never very prosperous, but did reasonably well. Its record maximum: 23,000 tons was carried in 1839. However, railway competition hit hard in 1865 with the opening of the Guildford and Horsham Railway, which was in much competition with the canal. There were also engineering problems with few sources of water to tap into, compounded by porous subsoils at summit level, which led to water shortages.

In 1867, some tourists cruised the canal whose trip was the subject of a book called &quot;The Thames to the Solent by Canal and Sea&quot;, which was published in 1868 by J. B. Dashwood, the same year in which the Wey and Arun Junction Canal (Abandonment) Act 1868 authorised closure. The canal was offered for sale in 1870, but was officially abandoned on 22 July 1871. The land sold to many along its route, although the canal company was not wound up until 1910.

==Restoration==

After a century of disuse, restoration began by The Wey &amp; Arun Canal Trust.

Interest in the canal was sparked by the publication in 1965 of P. A. L. Vine&#x27;s book &quot;London&#x27;s Lost Route to the Sea&quot;. As a result, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; weekend magazine carried a 5-page article about the canal. In 1968, a local group of enthusiasts became interested in the canal, and having carried out some research into its history, formed the Wey &amp; Arun Canal Society in 1970, with a view to reopening it. The Society evolved into the Wey &amp; Arun Canal Trust in 1973, a private company limited by guarantee with no share capital, the present custodians of the canal restoration. In 1990, the restoration was identified by the Inland Waterways Association&#x27;s Restoration Committee as one of those where significant progress was being made, and which would benefit from the backing of the Association. The Waterway Recovery Group, which gave active support to restoration schemes, developed a strategy of &quot;a guaranteed labour force for guaranteed work&quot; in 1992, which ensured that local societies would have the funding and relevant planning permission in place before a group of volunteers arrived to carry out the work. The Wey and Arun Canal was one of three schemes where working parties were run in this way. The practical outworking of this approach was demonstrated in the following year, when a section of the canal at Billingshurst was cleared, and three accommodation bridges were rebuilt by a working party of 250 people, as part of a Waterway Recovery Group initiative called &quot;Dig Deep&quot;.

The trust has reached agreements with several landowners to allow restoration work to be undertaken over half the length of the canal. By 2009, twenty-four bridges had been reconstructed, eleven locks restored, two aqueducts re-instated, and several miles of canal bed cleared and dredged.

The Lordings Lock waterwheel was reconstructed by Winston Harwood during the first decade of the 21st century. In 2010 the main spindle of the wheel broke and the wheel was rebuilt to a more effective design.

Having completed a multi-million pound B2133 road bridge-centred project (see below), restoration has continued northwards. Devil&#x27;s Hole Lock (lock 6) had been partially destroyed by the Canadian army as part of a training exercise in 1942. It has been rebuilt and extended to take narrow boats. The lock was reopened on 17 April 2010, and the opening ceremony was carried out by Colonel Paul Rutherford, the Senior Army Adviser to the Canadian High Commissioner. Southland Lock (lock 7) required significant rebuilding, as many of the original bricks were removed in the 1930s, to be re-used by a local religious order. The lock was reopened on 21 June 2014 by Simon Carter, a local landowner with land adjoining this section of the canal. Working parties have since concentrated on the building of Gennets Bridge Lock (lock 8), a major exercise requiring the construction of a new concrete shell, faced with locally made bricks, and a bridge for a bridleway as nothing was left of the original lock structure.

Southland Lock is the current northern limit of navigation on the restored section, some from Drungewick Lock (lock 3) in the south.

An isolated section of the canal at Birtley was officially reopened on 28 October 2023. This was achieved by replacing two causeways that had been built across the canal with twin lift bridges. The northern bridge was once the site of a swing bridge, but the southern causeway was a new crossing as there was never a bridge at that location prior to the canal closing.

A photo-history of the canal&#x27;s restoration to date and the latest progress reports may be found on the Trust&#x27;s website.

===The B2133 bridge===
The hump-backed road bridge at Loxwood was removed and in-filled in 1905, (to be confirmed) severing the canal in two and leaving a major obstacle to restoration. The last boat passed under the bridge in 1869.

Modern regulations prevented the installation of a replacement hump-backed bridge, so restoration required the canal to burrow underneath, leaving the road at its existing level. This was a major engineering exercise, achieved by lowering a length of canal so that there is adequate headroom for a boat to pass under the road. At the southern end of the length, Brewhurst Lock was reconstructed reducing its fall to from the original drop of , and hence lowering the level of the water in the pound crossed by the bridge.

At the other end, a new lock (Loxwood Lock) was constructed, to provide for the difference between the new and original levels of the canal. In between, the canal bed was lowered by , the banks shored up with piling, and a new winding hole created. The new bridge crosses the canal on a skew angle, the resulting &#x27;tunnel&#x27; through which the canal passes measures . The towpath runs through the tunnel, alongside the canal, and also allows pedestrians to cross the road safely; however, the restricted bridge height means horse riders must cross at road level. Suitable access pathways had to be designed-in as the towpath is a bridleway at this point.

The work was completed, and the first boat passed under the new bridge into the new Loxwood Lock in April 2009. The project cost £1.8 million, making it one of the most expensive projects to be undertaken by a volunteer canal trust, and was officially opened by Lord Sterling of Plaistow on 9 May. The Canal Trust website includes a comprehensive photo-diary of the construction work.
The design of the bridge was not appreciated by many of the residents of Loxwood, because of its steel barriers, and following a period of consultation and fund-raising, planning permission was obtained to replace them with lower, brick-faced parapets, to match the adjacent lock and footbridge. The lock and footbridge achieved second place in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Community Benefit Awards in 2010. The trust&#x27;s success was particularly welcome, as it was the only entry in the category by a voluntary organisation, rather than a professional one. The scheme, which cost £1.9 million, was also the winner in the Community category of the 2011 Waterways Renaissance Awards. The awards are made annually by the Waterways Trust.

<text>Prince Alexander Danilovich Menshikov (; – ) was a Russian statesman, whose official titles included Generalissimo, Prince of the Russian Empire and Duke of Izhora (Duke of Ingria), Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Duke of Cosel. A highly appreciated associate and friend of Tsar Peter the Great, he was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Russia from 1725 to 1727.

==Early life==

Menshikov was born on in Moscow. Historian Paul Bushkovitch argues that Menshikov was not an aristocrat and was most likely descended from servants of the palace stables, who among others made up the first soldiers of Peter&#x27;s &#x27;toy armies.&#x27; As the legend (dating from around 1710) goes, he was making a living on the streets of Moscow as a vendor of stuffed buns known as pirozhki at the age of twenty. His fine appearance and witty character caught the attention of Franz Lefort, Peter&#x27;s first favourite, who took him into his service and finally transferred him to the tsar. On the death of Lefort in 1699, Menshikov succeeded him as Peter&#x27;s prime favourite and confidant. 

He took an active part in the Azov campaigns (1695–1696) against the Ottoman Empire. During the tsar&#x27;s first foreign tour in the next year, Menshikov worked by his side in the dockyard of Amsterdam, and acquired a thorough knowledge of shipbuilding and colloquial Dutch and German. He acted as subordinate to Boris Sheremetev, who was commander-in-chief during the retreat before Charles XII in 1708, subsequently participating in the battle of Holowczyn, the reduction of Mazepa, and the crowning victory of Poltava (), where he won his field-marshal&#x27;s baton.

==Corruption==

Around 1706 he had a conflict with Andrew Vinius; Vinius lost all of his land and goods. From 1709 to 1714 he served during the Courland, Holstein and Pomeranian campaigns, but then, as governor-general of Ingria, with almost unlimited powers, was entrusted with a leading part in the civil administration. Menshikov understood perfectly the principles on which Peter&#x27;s reforms were conducted and was the right hand of the tsar in all his gigantic undertakings. But he abused his powerful position, and his corrupt practices frequently brought him to the verge of ruin. Every time the tsar returned to Russia he received fresh accusations of plunder against &quot;his Serene Highness.&quot;

Peter&#x27;s first serious outburst of indignation (March 1711) was due to the prince&#x27;s looting in Poland. On his return to Russia in 1712, Peter discovered that Menshikov had turned a blind eye to wholesale corruption in his own governor-generalship. Peter warned him &quot;for the last time&quot; to change his ways. Yet, in 1713, he was implicated in the &quot;Solovey process&quot;, in the course of which it was demonstrated that he had defrauded the government of 100,000 roubles. He only owed his life on this occasion to a sudden illness. On his recovery Peter&#x27;s fondness for his friend overcame his sense of justice. In 1714 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

In the last year of Peter&#x27;s reign new allegations of fraud by Menshikov came to light, and he was obliged to appeal for protection to the empress Catherine. It was chiefly through the efforts of Menshikov and his colleague Tolstoi that, on the death of Peter, in 1725, Catherine was raised to the throne. Menshikov was committed to the Petrine system, and he recognised that, if that system were to continue, Catherine was, at that particular time, the only possible candidate. Her name was a watchword for the progressive faction. Her placement on the throne meant a final victory over ancient prejudices, a vindication of the new ideas of progress, and not least security for Menshikov and his ill-gotten fortune.

==Supremacy and disgrace==

During Catherine&#x27;s short reign (February 1725May 1727), Menshikov was practically the absolute ruler of Russia. He promoted himself to the unprecedented rank of Generalissimo, and was the only Russian to bear a princedom title. Upon finishing the construction of the Menshikov Palace on the Neva Embankment in St Petersburg (now assigned to the Hermitage Museum), Menshikov intended to make Oranienbaum a capital of his ephemeral Principality. Pushkin in one of his poems alluded to Menshikov as &quot;half-tsar&quot;.

On the whole he ruled well, his difficult position serving as some restraint upon his natural inclinations. He contrived to prolong his power after Catherine&#x27;s death by means of a forged will and a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. While his colleague Peter Tolstoi would have raised Elizabeth Petrovna to the throne, Menshikov set up the youthful Peter II, son of the tsarevich Alexei, with himself as dictator during the prince&#x27;s minority.

He now aimed at establishing himself definitely by marrying his daughter Mary to Peter II. But the old nobility, represented by the Dolgorukovs and the Galitzines, united to overthrow him, and he was deprived of all his dignities and offices and expelled from the capital (). Subsequently, he was deprived of his enormous wealth, stripped of the titles, and he and his whole family were banished to Beryozovo in Siberia, where he died on . His wife Darya Mikhailovna (born Arseneva) died on their way into exile in 1728 near Kazan.

According to Simon Sebag Montefiore in his book &quot;The Romanovs 1613–1918&quot; Menshikov was once punched twice by Tsar Peter the Great, once in the nose and once on the side of the head, after Tsar Peter saw Menshikov dancing with his sword still on, which is considered to be highly rude and offensive.

Menshikov built a wooden church in Beryozovo. He buried his daughter who died in exile there. Menshikov&#x27;s younger children survived the exile and were eventually returned to the court.

==Palaces==
==Children==

#Princess Maria Alexandrovna (26 December 17111729) engaged to Grand Duke Peter of Russia and died of smallpox in exile.
#Princess Alexandra Alexandrovna (17 December 171213 September 1736) married Gustav von Biron, brother of Ernst Johann von Biron, and died in childbirth.
#Prince Alexander Alexandrovich, Duke of Ingria (March 171427 November 1764) engaged to Grand Duchess Natalia Alexeyevna but eventually married Princess Yelizaveta Petrovna Golitsyna and had issue.

<text>Lyudmila Vasilyevna Zhuravleva (, ; born 22 May 1946) is a Soviet, Russian and Ukrainian astronomer, who worked at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnij, where she discovered 213 minor planets. She also serves as president
of the Crimean branch of the &quot;Prince Clarissimus Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov Foundation&quot; (which was founded in May 1995 in Berezovo, and is not the same as the &quot;Menshikov Foundation&quot; children&#x27;s charity founded by Anthea Eno, the wife of Brian Eno). She has discovered a number of asteroids, including the Trojan asteroid 4086 Podalirius and asteroid 2374 Vladvysotskij. Zhuravleva is ranked 43 in the Minor Planet Center&#x27;s list of those who have discovered minor planets. She is credited with having discovered 200, and co-discovered an additional 13 between 1972 and 1992. In the rating of minor planet discoveries, she is listed in 57th place out of 1,429 astronomers. The main-belt asteroid 26087 Zhuravleva, discovered by her colleague Lyudmila Karachkina at Nauchnij, was named in her honour.

<doc id="624684" wikidata="Q857525" url="?curid=624684" title="Annotation">
<text>An annotation is extra information associated with a particular point in a document or other piece of information. It can be a note that includes a comment or explanation. Annotations are sometimes presented in the margin of book pages. For annotations of different digital media, see web annotation and text annotation.

Five types of annotation are given LIDAR annotation, Image annotation, Text annotation, Video annotation, Audio annotation

== Literature, grammar and educational purposes ==

=== Practising visually ===
Annotation Practices are highlighting a phrase or sentence and including a comment, circling a word that needs defining, posing a question when something is not fully understood and writing a short summary of a key section. It also invites students to &quot;(re)construct a history through material engagement and exciting DIY (Do-It-Yourself) annotation practices.&quot; Annotation practices that are available today offer a remarkable set of tools for students to begin to work, and in a more collaborative, connected way than has been previously possible.

=== Text and film annotation ===
Text and Film Annotation is a technique that involves using comments, text within a film. Analyzing videos is an undertaking that is never entirely free of preconceived notions, and the first step for researchers is to find their bearings within the field of possible research approaches and thus reflect on their own basic assumptions. Annotations can take part within the video, and can be used when the data video is recorded. It is being used as a tool in text and film to write one&#x27;s thoughts and emotion into the markings. In any number of steps of analysis, it can also be supplemented with more annotations. Anthropologists Clifford Geertz calls it a &quot;thick description.&quot; This can give a sense of how useful annotation is, especially by adding a description of how it can be implemented in film.

=== Medieval marginalia ===
Marginalia refers to writing or decoration in the margins of a manuscript. Medieval marginalia is so well known that amusing or disconcerting instances of it are fodder for viral aggregators such as Buzzfeed and Brainpickings, and the fascination with other readers’ reading is manifest in sites such as Melville&#x27;s Marginalia Online or Harvard&#x27;s online exhibit of marginalia from six personal libraries. It can also be a part of other websites such as Pinterest, or even meme generators and GIF tools.

=== Textual scholarship ===

Textual scholarship is a discipline that often uses the technique of annotation to describe or add additional historical context to texts and physical documents to make it easier to understand.

=== Student uses ===
Students often highlight passages in books in order to actively engage with the text. Students can use annotations to refer back to key phrases easily, or add marginalia to aid studying and finding connections between the text and prior knowledge or running themes.

Annotated bibliographies add commentary on the relevance or quality of each source, in addition to the usual bibliographic information that merely identifies the source.

Students use Annotation not only for academic purposes, but interpreting their own thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Sites such as Scalar and Omeka are sites that students use. There are multiple genres with Annotation such as math, film, linguists, and literary theory which students find it most helpful to use. Most students reported the annotation process as helpful for improving overall writing ability, grammar, and academic vocabulary knowledge.

=== Mathematical expression annotation ===

Mathematical expressions (symbols and formulae) can be annotated with their natural language meaning. This is essential for disambiguation, since symbols may have different meanings (e.g., &quot;E&quot; can be &quot;energy&quot; or &quot;expectation value&quot;, etc.). The annotation process can be facilitated and accelerated through recommendation, e.g., using the &quot;AnnoMathTeX&quot; system that is hosted by Wikimedia.

=== Learning and instruction ===
From a cognitive perspective, annotation has an important role in learning and instruction. As part of guided noticing it involves highlighting, naming or labelling and commenting aspects of visual representations to help focus learners&#x27; attention on specific visual aspects. In other words, it means the assignment of typological representations (culturally meaningful categories), to topological representations (e.g. images). This is especially important when experts, such as medical doctors, interpret visualizations in detail and explain their interpretations to others, for example by means of digital technology. Here, annotation can be a way to establish common ground between interactants with different levels of knowledge. The value of annotation has been empirically confirmed, for example, in a study which shows that in computer-based teleconsultations the integration of image annotation and speech leads to significantly improved knowledge exchange compared with the use of images and speech without annotation.

=== On YouTube ===
Annotations were removed on January 15, 2019, from YouTube after around a decade of service. They had allowed users to provide information that popped up during videos, but YouTube indicated they did not work well on small mobile screens, and were being abused.

== Software and engineering ==
=== Text documents ===

Markup languages like XML and HTML annotate text in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from that text. They can be used to add information about the desired visual presentation, or machine-readable semantic information, as in the semantic web.

=== Tabular data ===
This includes CSV and XLS. The process of assigning semantic annotations to tabular data is referred to as semantic labelling. Semantic Labelling is the process of assigning annotations from ontologies to tabular data. This process is also referred to as semantic annotation. Semantic Labelling is often done in a (semi-)automatic fashion. Semantic Labelling techniques work on entity columns, numeric columns, coordinates, and more.

==== Semantic labelling techniques ====
There are several semantic labelling types which utilises machine learning techniques. These techniques can be categorised following the work of Flach as follows: geometric (using lines and planes, such as Support-vector machine, Linear regression), probabilistic (e.g., Conditional random field), logical (e.g., Decision tree learning), and Non-ML techniques (e.g., balancing coverage and specificity). Note that the geometric, probabilistic, and logical machine learning models are not mutually exclusive.

===== Geometric techniques =====
Pham et al. use Jaccard index and TF-IDF similarity for textual data and Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for the numeric ones. Alobaid and Corcho use fuzzy clustering (c-means) to label numeric columns.

===== Probabilistic techniques =====
Limaye et al. uses TF-IDF similarity and graphical models. They also use support-vector machine to compute the weights. Venetis et al. construct an isA database which consists of the pairs (instance, class) and then compute maximum likelihood using these pairs. Alobaid and Corcho approximated the q-q plot for predicting the properties of numeric columns.

===== Logical techniques =====
Syed et al. built Wikitology, which is &quot;a hybrid knowledge base of structured and unstructured information extracted from Wikipedia augmented by RDF data from DBpedia and other Linked Data resources.&quot; For the Wikitology index, they use PageRank for Entity linking, which is one of the tasks often used in semantic labelling. Since they were not able to query Google for all Wikipedia articles to get the PageRank, they used Decision tree to approximate it.

===== Non-ML techniques =====
Alobaid and Corcho presented an approach to annotate entity columns. The technique starts by annotating the cells in the entity column with the entities from the reference knowledge graph (e.g., DBpedia). The classes are then gathered and each one of them is scored based on several formulas they presented taking into account the frequency of each class and their depth according to the subClass hierarchy.

==== Semantic labelling common tasks ====
Here are some of the common semantic labelling tasks presented in the literature:

===== Entity linking and disambiguation =====
This is the most common task in semantic labelling. Given a text of a cell and a data source, the approach predicts the entity and link it to the one identified in the given data source. For example, if the input to the approach were the text &quot;Richard Feynman&quot; and a URL to the SPARQL endpoint of DBpedia, the approach would return &quot;http://dbpedia.org/resource/Richard_Feynman&quot;, which is the entity from DBpedia. Some approaches use exact match. while others use similarity metrics such as Cosine similarity

===== Subject column identification =====
The subject column of a table is the column that contain the main subjects/entities in the table. Some approaches expects the subject column as an input while others predict the subject column such as TableMiner+.

===== Column data-type detection =====
Columns types are divided differently by different approaches. Some divide them into strings/text and numbers while others divide them further (e.g., Number Typology, Date, coordinates).

===== Relation prediction =====
The relation between Madrid and Spain is &quot;capitalOf&quot;. Such relations can easily be found in ontologies, such as DBpedia. Venetis et al. use TextRunner to extract the relation between two columns. Syed et al. use the relation between the entities of the two columns and the most frequent relation is selected.

==== Gold standards ====
T2D is the most common gold standard for semantic labelling. Two versions exists of T2D: T2Dv1 (sometimes are referred to T2D as well) and T2Dv2. Another known benchmarks are published with the SemTab Challenge.

=== Source control ===
The &quot;annotate&quot; function (also known as &quot;blame&quot; or &quot;praise&quot;) used in source control systems such as Git, Team Foundation Server and Subversion determines who committed changes to the source code into the repository. This outputs a copy of the source code where each line is annotated with the name of the last contributor to edit that line (and possibly a revision number). This can help establish blame in the event a change caused a malfunction, or identify the author of brilliant code.

=== Java annotations ===

A special case is the Java programming language, where annotations can be used as a special form of syntactic metadata in the source code. Classes, methods, variables, parameters and packages may be annotated. The annotations can be embedded in class files generated by the compiler and may be retained by the Java virtual machine and thus influence the run-time behaviour of an application. It is possible to create meta-annotations out of the existing ones in Java.

=== Image annotation ===

Automatic image annotation is used to classify images for image retrieval systems.

=== Computational biology ===

Since the 1980s, molecular biology and bioinformatics have created the need for DNA annotation. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it.

=== Digital imaging ===
In the digital imaging community the term annotation is commonly used for visible metadata superimposed on an image without changing the underlying master image, such as sticky notes, virtual laser pointers, circles, arrows, and black-outs (cf. redaction).

In the medical imaging community, an annotation is often referred to as a region of interest and is encoded in DICOM format.

== Other uses ==

=== Law ===
In the United States, legal publishers such as Thomson West and Lexis Nexis publish annotated versions of statutes, providing information about court cases that have interpreted the statutes. Both the federal United States Code and state statutes are subject to interpretation by the courts, and the annotated statutes are valuable tools in legal research.

=== Linguistics ===
One purpose of annotation is to transform the data into a form suitable for computer-aided analysis. Prior to annotation, an annotation scheme is defined that typically consists of tags. During tagging, transcriptionists manually add tags into transcripts where required linguistical features are identified in an annotation editor. The annotation scheme ensures that the tags are added consistently across the data set and allows for verification of previously tagged data. Aside from tags, more complex forms of linguistic annotation include the annotation of phrases and relations, e.g., in treebanks. Many different forms of linguistic annotation have been developed, as well as different formats and tools for creating and managing linguistic annotations, as described, for example, in the Linguistic Annotation Wiki.

<doc id="624686" wikidata="Q375224" url="?curid=624686" title="Panama Al Brown">
<text>Alfonso Teofilo Brown (July 5, 1902 – April 11, 1951), better known as Panama Al Brown, was a Panamanian professional boxer. He made history by becoming boxing&#x27;s first Latin American world champion, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest bantamweight boxers in history.

Brown won the NYSAC and lineal bantamweight titles in 1929 after defeating Gregorio Vidal. In 1930, he won both the NBA and IBU bantamweight titles, after defeating Johnny Erickson and Eugène Huat. After relocating to Paris, France, Brown became known within the gay nightlife of the time for his flamboyant lifestyle and his interest in the arts, performing in a cabaret.

As an Afro-Panamanian in the US, Brown faced racial barriers throughout his boxing career, and had been stripped of the NYSAC and NBA titles by 1934. He held the IBU title until 1935, when he lost it to Baltasar Sangchili.
In 1938, Brown fought for the IBU bantamweight title again in a rematch with Sangchili, winning on points. He continued to box until 1942, but failed to achieve the same level of success he had previously enjoyed. In 2002, Brown was named one of the 80 best fighters of the past 80 years by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine. He currently ranks #5 in BoxRec&#x27;s ranking of the greatest bantamweight boxers in history. He has been inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Alfonso Teofilo Brown was born on July 5, 1902, to Afro-Caribbean immigrants in the City of Colón, Panama.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBHOF/Panama Al Brown&quot;&gt;IBHOF/Panama Al Brown , IBHOF.com, Retrieved on 1-6-08&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Horace Brown, died when Brown was 13, and his mother, Esther Lashley, worked as a cleaner. His first exposure to boxing came while working as a young adult clerk for the United States Shipping Board, at the Panama Canal Zone, witnessing American soldiers boxing.

==Professional career==
===Early career===
Brown turned professional in 1922 under the guidance of manager Dave Lumiansky. His first fight took place on March 19, 1922, when he beat Jose Moreno by a decision in six at Colon. By his seventh fight, December 13 of that same year, he beat Sailor Patchett by a fifteen-round decision, to earn the Panamanian &#x27;Isthmus&#x27; flyweight title.

On September 22, 1923, he had his first fight abroad, drawing in four rounds with Johnny Breslin, in New York. He very quickly established a presence upon relocating to the city in 1923. His rise was rapid; a year after his move to New York, &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine rated him the third best flyweight in the world; two years later, the sixth best bantamweight.

Brown began campaigning extensively across the United States before he suffered his first loss, at the hands of Jimmy Russo on December 6, 1924, by decision in twelve. He would later avenge that defeat, and he beat Davey Abad and Willie LaMorte before being disqualified in the first round against Frankie Murray on June 11, 1925. Despite that setback, he kept on campaigning successfully, fighting for the first time in his career at Madison Square Garden on May 21, 1926, against Teddy Silva. Brown won with a third-round knockout. On October 14, 1928, he was listed as the National Boxing Association (NBA) bantamweight champion. On November 10 of that year, he knocked out Antoine Merlo in his Paris debut, at the Salle Wagram.

He enjoyed Paris so much that he decided to stay there for the rest of his life. In Paris he trained under Eugene Bullard who served as a fighter pilot in World War I. He became a hugely popular boxer in France, and fought on the European continent 40 times between 1929 and 1934. Over the next three years, he beat several fighters there, including former world champion Eugene Criqui.

An interesting case happened when he fought Gustav Humery, on January 29, 1929. Brown and Humery had previously agreed that they would not salute by touching gloves before the fight, and when the bell rang, Brown struck quickly, breaking Humery&#x27;s jaw with his first punch and sending him to the floor. With the referee&#x27;s count of ten seconds, the fight lasted a total of fifteen seconds, one of the quickest knockouts in boxing history.

===World bantamweight champion===
On June 18, 1929, Brown made history by becoming the world&#x27;s first Latin American world champion. He beat Gregorio Vidal by a fifteen-round decision to win the vacant NYSAC and lineal bantamweight titles, at the Queensboro Stadium, Long Island. He became a national idol in Panama, and an instant celebrity almost everywhere else in Latin America. Magazines such as Ring En Español were still talking about his achievement sixty years later. Soon after he lost a ten-round, non-title fight to Battling Battalino. On February 8, 1930, Brown beat Johnny Erickson by disqualification to claim the NBA bantamweight title. On October 4, 1930, he beat Eugène Huat by unanimous decision to claim the IBU bantamweight title.

On July 30, 1933, Brown defended his IBU title against British bantamweight champion Johnny King, at Kings Hall, Manchester. Brown knocked King down several times during the early rounds, though King fought on. During the seventh round King caught Brown with a right, almost knocking him out, but Brown managed to hold on for a points decision.

On February 19, 1934, Brown defended his IBU title against Young Perez at the Palais des Sports, Paris, in what would be the first of three encounters between the two boxers. Brown had a significant height and reach advantage, and proved too much for the Tunisian, who lost on points. Shortly after the NBA stripped Brown of his title for failing to defend it against their leading contender Rodolfo Casanova.

Brown retained his title nine times and had countless other fights before a rematch with Humery that ended in disaster: on May 17, 1934, Brown was disqualified in round six at Paris for using illegal tactics. A riot started and Brown suffered several broken bones and was sent into semi-unconsciousness by fans before the police could help him. Twenty minutes later, the locale where the rematch was held had almost been entirely destroyed.

For his next title defense, on November 1 of the same year, he travelled to Tunis, for his second encounter with Young Perez. Perez was counted out in round ten while on the floor, claiming that Brown had hit him with an illegal blow.

On June 1, 1935, Brown lost the title to Baltasar Sangchili by a fifteen-round decision, at the Plaza de Toros, in Valencia, Spain. After the loss he chose to retire from boxing, instead performing in a cabaret. Suffering from the prolonged effects of drug use, he was persuaded by Jean Cocteau to detox, receiving treatment at the Sainte-Anne Asylum, and begin training for a comeback to boxing. His first fight was against former French bantamweight champion Andre Regis, at the Salle Wagram, Paris, on September 21, 1937. Brown achieving a first-round knockout. He had a rematch with Sangchili on March 4, 1938, avenging his earlier loss with a fifteen-round decision to win the vacant IBU bantamweight title, but by this time the International Boxing Union was no longer recognized in the United States. His rematch win over Sangchili is believed to be his last great night, and, bowing to Cocteau&#x27;s wishes, Brown vowed to retire after one more fight. That came in 1939 against Valentin Angelmann in Paris, Brown stopped him in eight rounds.

===Later career===
With the advent of the World War II, Brown moved to the United States, settled in Harlem and tried to find work of the cabaret sort he performed in Paris when not fighting. There was none and before long he was fighting again, but not well.

Brown went on fighting until 1942, challenging unsuccessfully for the Panamanian Featherweight title on September 30, 1942, when he drew with Leocadio Torres, but retiring as a winner, defeating Kid Fortune by a decision in ten rounds on December 4 of the same year.

Not long after, he was arrested for using cocaine and deported for a year. He went back to New York afterward and, in his late 40s, took a lot of beatings while serving as a sparring partner for up-and-comers at a gym in Harlem, making a dollar a round.

Brown died penniless of tuberculosis in New York City in 1951. He had fainted on 42nd Street. The police thought he was drunk and took him to the station. Eventually he was transferred to Sea View Hospital. He died there on April 11, unaware that not long before, one of the newspapers in Paris had begun talks about organizing a fund drive to pay for his trip home.

During five years of investigation, Spanish painter Eduardo Arroyo wrote a biography of Panama Al Brown, titled &quot;Panama Al Brown, 1902-1951&quot;, first published by Edition Jean-Claude Lattès, Paris, in 1982.

Panama Al Brown&#x27;s final record is believed to have been 123 wins, 18 defeats and 10 draws, with 55 knockouts, placing him in the exclusive list of boxers who have won 50 or more wins by knockout. He was the recognized bantamweight world champion for six years and over that time made 10 title defenses against 8 different contenders, the best bantamweights and featherweights of his era.

==Personal life==
Brown quickly fell in love with Paris, and as a result spent much of his life there. He was noted for dressing elegantly, and enjoyed the night life of the city, frequenting bars and jazz clubs. Brown was gay and was involved in a long-term romantic relationship with Jean Cocteau. He owned a number of cars including a 1929 Packard 645 Sport, and several Bugattis. He joined Josephine Baker&#x27;s &quot;La Revue Nègre&quot; as a tap-dancer, and made his cabaret debut as a song-and-dance man at the Caprice Viennoise.

During the early 1930s, Brown contracted syphilis, and suffered from sores on his back. He recovered well enough to continue his boxing career, though without antibiotics it remains unknown as to what extent he overcame the infection.

<text>Jacobus Johannes Uys ( ; 30 May 1921 – 29 January 1996), better known as Jamie Uys, was a South African film director, best known for directing the 1980 comedy film &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot; and its 1989 sequel &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy II&quot;. Uys also directed the 1974 documentary film &quot;Animals Are Beautiful People&quot;.

==Early life==
Before his foray into film, Uys was a mathematics teacher in his hometown of Boksburg. He then married Hettie, a fellow mathematics teacher, and the couple started farming and opening trading posts along the Palala River. He was later appointed local magistrate and Justice of the Peace. In an interview, he stated, &quot;Every Tuesday I crossed the wildest country and swam through rivers to get to the police post where I could hold court&quot;.

==Career==

He made his debut as a film director in 1951 with the Afrikaans-language film &quot;Daar doer in die bosveld&quot;. He directed 24 films. He founded a company with Tommie Meyer but later they split up.

Uys received the 1981 Grand Prix at the Festival International du Film de Comedie of Vevey for &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, and in 1974 he received the Hollywood Foreign Press Association award for best documentary for &quot;Animals Are Beautiful People&quot;.

&quot;Animals Are Beautiful People&quot; is about the plant and animal life in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, especially desert creatures. A highlight of the film includes a scene with elephants, warthogs, baboons, ostriches and other animals staggering around after eating rotten, fermented marula fruit. Jamie Uys is credited with this legend of animals getting intoxicated on fermented marula fruits.

Jamie Uys&#x27;s most financially successful and well-known film is &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy&quot;, a comedy first released in 1980. The film features a San hunter/gatherer named N!xau in the lead role. Its plot concerns a Coca-Cola bottle that was thrown out of an airplane, fell into the Kalahari Desert and was found by a San tribe. As this was the only &quot;modern&quot; object in their world, it led to strife and it was decided that the bottle had to be returned to the gods, who must have sent it in the first place. The character played by N!xau was given the task to return it. The movie generated extensive word-of-mouth success in Europe, Japan and North America, with the movie rights initially being sold to 45 countries. It spawned a less successful sequel, &quot;The Gods Must Be Crazy II&quot;.

Uys had earlier made another film set substantially in the Kalahari Desert: &quot;Lost in the Desert&quot;, which tells the story of 8-year-old Dirkie Hayes&#x27;s efforts to survive in the desert after surviving a plane crash, whilst his father Anton mounts increasingly desperate efforts to find him. As well as directing the film, Jamie Uys also played the part of Anton, and his son Wynand Uys played the part of Dirkie. Some early sources and credits name the director and actor of Anton&#x27;s part as Jamie Hayes, and name Wynand Uys as Dirkie Hayes, but the relatively recent DVD release of the movie is attributed to their real names.

Uys&#x27;s other well-known film was &quot;Funny People&quot; in 1977, which was a comedy in the same genre as &quot;Candid Camera&quot; in the United States, putting unsuspecting people in embarrassing positions. These included a talking postbox, with the voice of a man claiming to be trapped inside, who asks a passerby for help. When the passerby returns with his friends, the &#x27;talking&#x27; postbox is silent, and his friends accuse him of being drunk. The sequel, &quot;Funny People II&quot;, was released in 1983, and features a young Arnold Vosloo who later found fame in Hollywood.

Uys loved the outdoors and to get away from the hubbub of Johannesburg where he lived. He had a modest A-frame dwelling at Paradise Beach (262, Die Heide St), a quiet coastal resort 5 km west of the surfers&#x27; paradise Jeffreys Bay (Eastern Cape). It was about 300 metres from the sea and for most of the years it had no electricity - only paraffin lamps and (later) gas lights. He at times would slip away to his favourite holiday retreat where he was seen collecting plant specimens, as a very keen amateur botanist who had his own herbarium. Uys would ride around on his bicycle to get to interesting spots in the veld. He also was a keen builder of model aeroplanes, on which he spent many hours during his Paradise Beach visits. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he had a luxurious house built on the beachfront, a couple of hundred metres away from his old A-frame.

Uys died of a heart attack in 1996 at the age of 74.

<text>Werfen () is a market town in the district of St. Johann im Pongau, in the Austrian state of Salzburg. It is mainly known for medieval Hohenwerfen Castle and the Eisriesenwelt ice cave, the largest in the world.

==Geography==

Werfen is located in the northwest of the historic Pongau region, about south of the city of Salzburg. The settlement is situated in the Salzach valley south of the Lueg Pass, between the Berchtesgaden Alps (Hagen Mountains and the Hochkönig massif) in the west and the Tennen Mountains in the east. The Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line (&quot;Giselabahn&quot;) and the Tauern Autobahn run parallel to the river. The region is known as the type locality of the geologic Werfen Formation, a Triassic stone layer of the Limestone Alps.

The municipality comprises the cadastral communities (&quot;Katastralgemeinden&quot;) of Reitsam, Scharten, Sulzau, Werfen Markt, and Wimm.

==History==
Important trade routes passed through the Salzach valley since ancient times, when the area was part of the Roman Noricum province. &quot;Werven&quot; was first mentioned about 1140 AD. The settlement arose south of Hohenwerfen Castle, erected from 1075 at the behest of the Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg during the Investiture Controversy with King Henry IV of Germany. It is one of the oldest markets in the former Archbishopric of Salzburg, with market privileges documented since 1425. At about the same time, the nearby parish of Pfarrwerfen was established, like the neighbouring settlement of Werfenweng in the east.

As the seat of the local administration, Werfen and the castle were heavily attacked during the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525/26. From 1675 onwards, numerous people in the environment of the local knacker Barbara Koller and her son Jakob were sentenced and executed in the Zaubererjackl witch trials. Werfen was also a centre of the expulsion of Salzburg Protestants under the rule of Prince-Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian in 1731. In the late 18th century, a large limonite deposit was developed in Sulzau, which from 1770 became the most important ironworks (&quot;Konkordiahütte&quot;) in the Salzburg archbishopric.

With the lands of the secularised prince-archbishopric, Werfen finally fell to the Austrian Empire by resolution of the Vienna Congress in 1816. The Salzburg-Tyrol Railway line from Salzburg to Wörgl opened in 1875, with stations in Sulzau, Tenneck, and Werfen.

The secluded Blühnbach Valley above the village of Tenneck is the site of the Baroque Schloss Blühnbach, a former hunting lodge of Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau, which in 1908 was acquired by Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. After the archduke&#x27;s assassination in 1914, the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty sold the castle to the German Krupp industrial magnates. The Krupp dynasty held the premises until the death of Arndt von Bohlen und Halbach in 1986, today the estates are privately owned by Frederick R. Koch.

A small portion of a picnic scene from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was filmed on a hillside of the village of Werfen. Julie Andrews and crew filmed the opening shots of the &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; sequence with Hohenwerfen Castle in the background. Hohenwerfen was also the location for some filming of &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;.

==Politics==
Seats in the municipal council (&quot;Gemeinderat&quot;) as of 2019 local elections:
*Austrian People&#x27;s Party (ÖVP): 10
*Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ): 6
*Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ): 3

<doc id="624690" wikidata="Q877023" url="?curid=624690" title="Hohenwerfen Castle">
<text>Hohenwerfen Castle () is a medieval rock castle, situated at an altitude of , on a rock pillar overlooking the Austrian market town of Werfen in the Salzach valley, approximately south of Salzburg. The fortress is surrounded by the Berchtesgaden Alps and the adjacent Tennen Mountains. Hohenwerfen is a &quot;sister&quot; of Hohensalzburg Fortress, both built by the Archbishops of Salzburg in the 11th century.

The castle became known internationally as the main location in the film &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;.

==History==

The fortification was built between 1075 and 1078 at the behest of Archbishop Gebhard of Salzburg during the Imperial Investiture Controversy, meant as a strategic bulwark atop a high rock. Gebhard, an ally of Pope Gregory VII and the anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden, had three major castles extended to secure the route across the Eastern Alps along the Salzach river against the forces of King Henry IV of Germany: Hohenwerfen, Hohensalzburg and Petersberg Castle at Friesach in Carinthia. Nevertheless, King Henry had Gebhard expelled in 1077 and the archbishop could not return to Salzburg until 1086, only to die at Hohenwerfen two years later.

In the following centuries Hohenwerfen served Salzburg&#x27;s rulers, the prince-archbishops, not only as a military base but also as a residence and hunting retreat. The fortress was extended in the 12th century and to a lesser extent again in the 16th century during the German Peasants&#x27; War, when in 1525 and 1526 riotous farmers and miners from the south of Salzburg moved towards the city, laying fire and severely damaging the castle.


Alternatively it was used as a state prison and therefore had a somewhat sinister reputation. Its prison walls have witnessed the tragic fate of many &#x27;criminals&#x27; who spent their days there – maybe their last – under inhumane conditions, and, periodically, various highly ranked noblemen have also been imprisoned there including rulers such as Archbishop Adalbert III, arrested by his own &quot;ministeriales&quot; in 1198; Count Albert of Friesach (in 1253); the Styrian governor Siegmund von Dietrichstein, captured by insurgent peasants in 1525; and Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich Raitenau, who died here in 1617 after six years of imprisonment.

In 1931 the fortress, owned by Archduke Eugen of Austria since 1898, was again damaged by a fire and, though largely restored, finally had to be sold to the Salzburg &quot;Reichsgau&quot; administration in 1938. In World War II, the castle served as a &quot;Gauführerschule&quot;, a nazi education camp opened on 5 March 1939 by Salzburg&#x27;s Gauleiter Friedrich Rainer and active during World War II. After the war it was used as a training camp by the Austrian Gendarmerie (rural police) until 1987.

Currently, the bastion functions as a museum. Among the numerous attractions offered by the fortress are guided tours showing its extensive weapons collection, the historical Salzburg Falconry with the falconry museum as well as a fortress tavern. The historic Falconry Centre is a special attraction, offering daily flight demonstrations using various birds of prey, including eagles, falcons, hawks, and vultures.

== Owners ==
Formerly the castle belonged to the House of Habsburg. The estate is now owned by the state of Salzburg.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1968 film &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; the castle featured as the fictional &quot;Schloß Adler&quot; that is raided by a S.O.E. paratroop team during World War II.
* In the Amazon Video original series &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot; (2015) the castle was used as the Führer&#x27;s headquarters.
* The castle can be seen in the background of the &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot; picnic scene in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; starring Julie Andrews, which was filmed on a hillside showing the village of Werfen.
* In the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops III&quot;, the zombies map &quot;Der Eisendrache&quot; is based on &#x27;Hohenwerfen Castle&#x27;.

<text>Guantes was a Spanish-language boxing magazine that was produced from Panama and later from New York City. The magazine&#x27;s name means &quot;gloves&quot; in Spanish.

==Profile==
The publisher of &quot;Guantes&quot; was Hispano American Publications. Chon Romero served as the editor-in-chief of the magazine for a long time. &quot;Guantes&quot; covered news from the boxing world with a special reference to hispanic boxing news. Each issue of the magazine featured the top ten boxers worldwide. &quot;Ring En Español&quot;, which stopped production in 1985, was the main competitor of the magazine.

&quot;Guantes&quot; held yearly award ceremonies to reward reigning world boxing champions. These ceremonies were usually celebrated at New York&#x27;s restaurant, &quot;Victor&#x27;s Cafe&quot;. Many corporate giants have sponsored the event: for many years, the event was called the &quot;Timex / Guantes&quot; awards, at other times, the &quot;Roblex | Guantes&quot; award.

<doc id="624700" wikidata="Q440183" url="?curid=624700" title="Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc">
<text>Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (1 December 1580 – 24 June 1637), often known simply as Peiresc, or by the Latin form of his name, Peirescius, was a French astronomer, antiquary and savant, who maintained a wide correspondence with scientists, and was a successful organizer of scientific inquiry. His research included a determination of the difference in longitude of various locations in Europe, around the Mediterranean, and in North Africa.

==Early life==
Peiresc&#x27;s father was a higher magistrate and city surgeon in Provence from a wealthy noble family, who with his wife fled their home town of Aix-en-Provence to avoid the plague raging there, settling in Belgentier in Var. Peiresc was born in Belgentier and educated in Aix-en-Provence and Avignon, as well as at the Jesuit college at Tournon. At Toulon, he first became interested in astronomy. Studying law and becoming interested in archaeology, he travelled to Italy, Switzerland and France in 1599, and finally finished his legal studies in 1604 at the University of Montpellier. It was also in 1604 that he assumed the name &quot;Peiresc&quot; after a domain in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (now spelled Peyresq) which he had inherited from his father, although he himself never visited it.

After receiving his degree, he travelled to Paris (in 1605–1606, with his patron Guillaume du Vair, president of the Parlement of Provence), London and Flanders before returning to Aix in 1607 to take over his uncle&#x27;s position as &quot;conseiller&quot; in the Parlement of Provence under du Vair. He held this post until 1615.

==Intellectual and collector==
From 1615 until 1622, Peiresc again visited Paris with du Vair. He then returned to Provence to serve as senator of the sovereign court. He became a patron of science and art, studied fossils, and supported the astronomer Pierre Gassendi from 1634 to 1637. Virginio Cesarini proposed him for membership of the Accademia dei Lincei in 1621, but it is not certain whether he joined.

Peiresc&#x27;s position as a great intellectual at the time of the Scientific Revolution has led to his being called a &quot;Prince of the Republic of Letters&quot;. He was also a noted politician in his home region, and a tireless letter-writer (10,000 of his letters survive, and he was in constant correspondence with François de Malherbe, Hugo Grotius, the brothers Dupuy, Alphonse-Louis du Plessis de Richelieu, and with his great friend Rubens. His correspondence to Malherbe throws light on the personality of Malherbe&#x27;s troubled son Marc-Antoine Malherbe.

Peiresc became one of the first admirers and supporters of Caravaggio in France. He first discovered Caravaggio&#x27;s works in the Contarelli chapel in Rome in 1600 when he was only 20 years old. In his hometown, he gathered around him a sort of &#x27;caravaggesque workshop of Southern France&#x27; with artists including Flemish artist Louis Finson, Martin Hermann Faber, Trophime Bigot and other painters. He promoted the Caravaggesque style by arranging commissions for these artists. He was instrumental in obtaining a number of commissions for Finson, including for history paintings and portraits. Finson also painted a &quot;portrait of de Peyresc&quot;. Peiresc was an avid art collector and relied on Finson&#x27;s contacts in Italy to acquire two works of Caravaggio from the Pasqualini family of Rome.

Peiresc&#x27;s house in Aix-en-Provence was a veritable museum, and held a mix of antique sculptures, modern paintings, medals, books and gardens with exotic plants. He acquired the Byzantine Barberini ivory (it is not known how or from whom) and offered it to Francesco Barberini: the work is now in the Louvre. He had the Codex Luxemburgensis, the surviving Carolingian copy of the Chronography of 354 in his possession for many years; after his death it disappeared. He owned over 18,000 coins and medals, and was also an archaeologist, amateur artist, historian (he demonstrated that Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasion of Britain set out not from Calais but from St Omer), Egyptologist, botanist, zoologist (studying chameleons, crocodiles, the elephant and the alzaron, a sort of Nubian gazelle with a bull-like head, now disappeared), physiologist, geographer (put on the project of linking Aix to Marseilles), and ecologist.

==Astronomer==
Peiresc was also an astronomer. In 1610 du Vair purchased a telescope, which Peiresc and Joseph Gaultier used for observing the skies, including Jupiter&#x27;s moons; his courtly suggestion that individual names from the Medici family be applied to these &quot;Medicean stars&quot; was not taken up. Peiresc also made detailed observations of the Orion Nebula in 1610; Gaultier became the second person to see it in the telescope. To determine longitude with greater precision, he coordinated the observation of the lunar eclipses of 28 August 1635 right across the Mediterranean; this allowed him to work out that the Mediterranean sea was in fact 1,000 km shorter than had previously been thought. Peiresc also wrote letters to Galileo, Pierre Gassendi and Tommaso Campanella, two of whom he defended when they were arrested by the Inquisition.

==Final years==
Peiresc wrote an &quot;abridged history of Provence&quot;, but died before editing it: it was only published (edited by Jacques Ferrier and Michel Feuillas) in 1982. With Gassendi&#x27;s support, notably financially, he and the engraver Claude Mellan began to produce a map of the Moon&#x27;s surface, but again Peiresc died before completing it.

Peiresc died on 24 June 1637 in Aix-en-Provence.

==Works==
Peiresc&#x27;s works include:

*&quot;Histoire abrégée de Provence&quot;
*&quot;Lettres à Malherbe&quot; (1606–1628)
*&quot;Traitez des droits et des libertés de l&#x27;Eglise gallicane&quot; (1639)
*&quot;Vita Peireskii&quot; (1641)
*&quot;Mémoires&quot;
*&quot;Bulletin Rubens&quot;
*&quot;Notes inédites de Peiresc sur quelques points d&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot;
*&quot;Correspondance de Peiresc et Aleandro&quot; (1616-1618)

==Legacy==
A bronze bust of Peiresc stands on the square of the university in Aix-en-Provence, facing the cathedral of Saint Sauveur. His home near the palais de Justice was demolished to build the present Palais, and has completely disappeared.

The village museum in Peyresq near Digne-les-Bains is wholly given over to his work.

Peiresc was honored in 1935 by the naming of the lunar crater Peirescius (46.5S, 67.6E, 61 km diameter); and in 1993 by the naming of the asteroid 19226 Peiresc.

<text>A pole star is a visible star that is approximately aligned with the axis of rotation of an astronomical body; that is, a star whose apparent position is close to one of the celestial poles. On Earth, a pole star would lie directly overhead when viewed from the North or the South Pole.

Currently, Earth&#x27;s pole stars are Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris), a bright magnitude 2 star aligned approximately with its northern axis that serves as a pre-eminent star in celestial navigation, and a much dimmer magnitude 5.5 star on its southern axis, Polaris Australis (Sigma Octantis).

From around 1700 BC until just after 300 AD, Kochab (Beta Ursae Minoris) and Pherkad (Gamma Ursae Minoris) were twin northern pole stars, though neither was as close to the pole as Polaris is now.

==History==


In classical antiquity, Beta Ursae Minoris (Kochab) was closer to the celestial north pole than Alpha Ursae Minoris. While there was no naked-eye star close to the pole, the midpoint between Alpha and Beta Ursae Minoris was reasonably close to the pole, and it appears that the entire constellation of Ursa Minor, in antiquity known as &quot;Cynosura&quot; (Greek Κυνόσουρα &quot;dog&#x27;s tail&quot;), was used as indicating the northern direction for the purposes of navigation by the Phoenicians. The ancient name of Ursa Minor, anglicized as &quot;cynosure&quot;, has since itself become a term for &quot;guiding principle&quot; after the constellation&#x27;s use in navigation.

Alpha Ursae Minoris (Polaris) was described as ἀειφανής (transliterated as &quot;aeiphanes&quot;) meaning &quot;always above the horizon&quot;, &quot;ever-shining&quot; by Stobaeus in the 5th century, when it was still removed from the celestial pole by about 8°. It was known as &quot;scip-steorra&quot; (&quot;ship-star&quot;) in 10th-century Anglo-Saxon England, reflecting its use in navigation. In the Vishnu Purana, it is personified under the name &quot;Dhruva&quot; (&quot;immovable, fixed&quot;).

The name &quot;stella polaris&quot; was coined in the Renaissance, even though at that time it was well recognized that it was several degrees away from the celestial pole; Gemma Frisius in the year 1547 determined this distance as 3°8&#x27;.
An explicit identification of Mary as &quot;stella maris&quot; with the North Star (&quot;Polaris&quot;) becomes evident in the title &quot;Cynosura seu Mariana Stella Polaris&quot; (i.e. &quot;Cynosure, or the Marian Polar Star&quot;), a collection of Marian poetry published by Nicolaus Lucensis (Niccolo Barsotti de Lucca) in 1655.

==Precession of the equinoxes==
In 2022 Polaris&#x27; mean declination was 89.35 degrees North; (at epoch J2000 it was 89.26 degrees N). So it appears due north in the sky to a precision better than one degree, and the angle it makes with respect to the true horizon (after correcting for refraction and other factors) is within a degree of the latitude of the observer. 
The celestial pole will be nearest Polaris in 2100.

Due to the precession of the equinoxes (as well as the stars&#x27; proper motions), the role of North Star has passed from one star to another in the remote past, and will pass in the remote future. In 3000 BC, the faint star Thuban in the constellation Draco was the North Star, aligning within 0.1° distance from the celestial pole, the closest of any of the visible pole stars. However, at magnitude 3.67 (fourth magnitude) it is only one-fifth as bright as Polaris, and today it is invisible in light-polluted urban skies.

During the 1st millennium BC, Beta Ursae Minoris (Kochab) was the bright star closest to the celestial pole, but it was never close enough to be taken as marking the pole, and the Greek navigator Pytheas in ca. 320 BC described the celestial pole as devoid of stars. In the Roman era, the celestial pole was about equally distant between Polaris and Kochab.

The precession of the equinoxes takes about 25,770 years to complete a cycle. Polaris&#x27; mean position (taking account of precession and proper motion) will reach a maximum declination of +89°32&#x27;23&quot;, which translates to 1657&quot; (or 0.4603°) from the celestial north pole, in February 2102. Its maximum apparent declination (taking account of nutation and aberration) will be +89°32&#x27;50.62&quot;, which is 1629&quot; (or 0.4526°) from the celestial north pole, on 24 March 2100.

Precession will next point the north celestial pole at stars in the northern constellation Cepheus. The pole will drift to space equidistant between Polaris and Gamma Cephei (&quot;Errai&quot;) by 3000 AD, with Errai reaching its closest alignment with the northern celestial pole around 4200 AD. Iota Cephei and Beta Cephei will stand on either side of the northern celestial pole some time around 5200 AD, before moving to closer alignment with the brighter star Alpha Cephei (&quot;Alderamin&quot;) around 7500 AD.

Precession will then point the north celestial pole at stars in the northern constellation Cygnus. Like Beta Ursae Minoris during the 1st millennium BC, the bright star closest to the celestial pole in the 10th millennium AD, first-magnitude Deneb, will be a distant 7° from the pole, never close enough to be taken as marking the pole, while third-magnitude Delta Cygni will be a more helpful pole star, at a distance of 3° from celestial north, around 11,250 AD. Precession will then point the north celestial pole nearer the constellation Lyra, where the second brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, Vega, will be a pole star around 14,500 AD, though at a distance of 5° from celestial north.

Precession will eventually point the north celestial pole nearer the stars in the constellation Hercules, pointing towards Tau Herculis around 18,400 AD. The celestial pole will then return to the stars in constellation Draco (Thuban, mentioned above) before returning to the current constellation, Ursa Minor. When Polaris becomes the North Star again around 27,800 AD, due to its proper motion it then will be farther away from the pole than it is now, while in 23,600 BC it was closer to the pole.

Over the course of Earth&#x27;s 26,000-year axial precession cycle, a series of bright naked eye stars (an apparent magnitude up to +6; a full moon is −12.9) in the northern hemisphere will hold the transitory title of North Star. While other stars might line up with the north celestial pole during the 26,000 year cycle, they do not necessarily meet the naked eye limit needed to serve as a useful indicator of north to an Earth-based observer, resulting in periods of time during the cycle when there is no clearly defined North Star. There will also be periods during the cycle when bright stars give only an approximate guide to &quot;north&quot;, as they may be greater than 5° of angular diameter removed from direct alignment with the north celestial pole.

The 26,000 year cycle of North Stars, starting with the current star, with stars that will be &quot;near-north&quot; indicators when no North Star exists during the cycle, including each star&#x27;s average brightness and closest alignment to the north celestial pole during the cycle:

==Southern pole star (South Star)==
Currently, there is no South Pole Star like Polaris, the so-called &quot;North Star&quot;. Sigma Octantis is the closest near naked-eye star to the south celestial pole, but at apparent magnitude 5.47 it is barely visible on a clear night, making it less useful for casual navigational or astronomy alignment purposes.
It is a yellow giant 294 light years from Earth. Its angular separation from the pole is about 1° (). The Southern Cross constellation functions as an approximate southern pole constellation, by pointing to where a southern pole star would be.

At the equator, it is possible to see both Polaris and the Southern Cross. The celestial south pole is moving toward the Southern Cross, which has pointed to the south pole for the last 2000 years or so. As a consequence, the constellation is no longer visible from subtropical northern latitudes, as it was in the time of the ancient Greeks.

Around 200 BC, the star Beta Hydri was the nearest bright star to the celestial south pole. Around 2800 BC, Achernar was only 8 degrees from the south pole.

In the next 7500 years, the south celestial pole will pass close to the stars Gamma Chamaeleontis (4200 AD), I Carinae, Omega Carinae (5800 AD), Upsilon Carinae, Iota Carinae (Aspidiske, 8100 AD) and Delta Velorum (Alsephina, 9200 AD). From the eightieth to the ninetieth centuries, the south celestial pole will travel through the False Cross. Around 14,000 AD Canopus will have a declination of –82°, meaning it will rise and set daily for latitudes between 8°S and 8°N, and will not rise to viewers north of this latter 8th parallel north.

Precession and proper motion mean that Sirius will be a future southern pole star: at 88.4° S declination in the year 66,270 AD; and 87.7° S declination in the year 93,830 AD.

==Other planets==
Pole stars of other planets are defined analogously: they are stars (brighter than 6th magnitude, i.e., visible to the naked eye under ideal conditions) that most closely coincide with the projection of the planet&#x27;s axis of rotation onto the celestial sphere. Different planets have different pole stars because their axes are oriented differently. (See Poles of astronomical bodies.)

==In religion and mythology==
In the medieval period, Polaris was also known as &quot;stella maris&quot; (&quot;star of the sea&quot;, from its use for navigation at sea), as in e.g. Bartholomaeus Anglicus (d. 1272), in the translation of John Trevisa (1397):

Polaris was associated with Marian veneration from an early time, Our Lady, Star of the Sea being a title of the Blessed Virgin. This tradition goes back to a misreading of Saint Jerome&#x27;s translation of Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Onomasticon&quot;, &quot;De nominibus hebraicis&quot; (written ca. 390). Jerome gave &quot;stilla maris&quot; &quot;drop of the sea&quot; as a (false) Hebrew etymology of the name &quot;Maria&quot;. This &quot;stilla maris&quot; was later misread as &quot;stella maris&quot;; the misreading is also found in the manuscript tradition of Isidore&#x27;s &quot;Etymologiae&quot; (7th century); it probably arises in the Carolingian era; a late 9th-century manuscript of Jerome&#x27;s text still has &quot;stilla&quot;, not &quot;stella&quot;, but Paschasius Radbertus, also writing in the 9th century, makes an explicit reference to the &quot;Star of the Sea&quot; metaphor, saying that Mary is the &quot;Star of the Sea&quot; to be followed on the way to Christ, &quot;lest we capsize amid the storm-tossed waves of the sea.&quot;

In Mandaean cosmology, the Pole Star is considered to be auspicious and is associated with the World of Light (&quot;heaven&quot;). Mandaeans face north when praying, and temples are also oriented towards the north. On the contrary, the south is associated with the World of Darkness.

<text>Doctor Judith Lieberman, (August 14, 1904 — December 1978), was an American educator and school administrator. She served as Hebrew principal and later dean of Hebrew studies of Shulamith School for Girls in New York City, the first Jewish day school for girls in North America. Her tenure there started in 1941 and lasted over 25 years.

She was the granddaughter of Rabbi Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin, daughter of Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan (leader of the Mizrachi), and second wife of Jewish religious scholar Saul Lieberman.

Lieberman spent World War I with her paternal grandmother, the unofficial administrator of the Volozhiner Yeshiva. She joined her immediate family after the war in the United States, and graduated from New York City public high school. Lieberman studied for her bachelor&#x27;s degree at Hunter College and then moved to Columbia University under Professor Hates and Professor David S. Muzzey. She completed a PhD in comparative literature at the University of Zurich in 1931.

In 1932, she married Saul Lieberman, who had been widowed two years earlier. She spent the remainder of the decade in Jerusalem with her husband, and then moved back to New York&#x27;s Upper West Side with him. She quickly gained a position at Shulamith, then based in Borough Park.

Among her publications were &quot;Robert Browning and Hebraism&quot; (1934), and an autobiographical chapter which was included in &quot;Thirteen Americans, Their Spiritual Autobiographies&quot; (1953), edited by Louis Finkelstein.

<doc id="624708" wikidata="Q22675078" url="?curid=624708" title="Persistence of a number">
<text>In mathematics, the persistence of a number is the number of times one must apply a given operation to an integer before reaching a fixed point at which the operation no longer alters the number.

Usually, this involves additive or multiplicative persistence of a non-negative integer, which is how often one has to replace the number by the sum or product of its digits until one reaches a single digit. Because the numbers are broken down into their digits, the additive or multiplicative persistence depends on the radix. In the remainder of this article, base ten is assumed.

The single-digit final state reached in the process of calculating an integer&#x27;s additive persistence is its digital root. Put another way, a number&#x27;s additive persistence counts how many times we must sum its digits to arrive at its digital root.

== Examples ==
The additive persistence of 2718 is 2: first we find that 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18, and then that 1 + 8 = 9. The multiplicative persistence of 39 is 3, because it takes three steps to reduce 39 to a single digit: 39 → 27 → 14 → 4. Also, 39 is the smallest number of multiplicative persistence 3.

== Smallest numbers of a given multiplicative persistence ==
In base 10, there is thought to be no number with a multiplicative persistence greater than 11; this is known to be true for numbers up to 2.67×1030000. The smallest numbers with persistence 0, 1, 2, ... are:
:0, 10, 25, 39, 77, 679, 6788, 68889, 2677889, 26888999, 3778888999, 277777788888899. 

The search for these numbers can be sped up by using additional properties of the decimal digits of these record-breaking numbers. These digits must be in increasing order (with the exception of the second number, 10), and – except for the first two digits – all digits must be 7, 8, or 9. There are also additional restrictions on the first two digits.
Based on these restrictions, the number of candidates for &quot;n&quot;-digit numbers with record-breaking persistence is only proportional to the square of &quot;n&quot;, a tiny fraction of all possible &quot;n&quot;-digit numbers. However, any number that is missing from the sequence above would have multiplicative persistence &gt; 11; such numbers are believed not to exist, and would need to have over 30,000 digits if they do exist.

==Properties of additive persistence==
* The additive persistence of a number is smaller than or equal to the number itself, with equality only when the number is zero.
* For base formula_1 and natural numbers formula_2 and formula_3 the numbers formula_4 and formula_5 have the same additive persistence.
More about the additive persistence of a number can be found here.

==Smallest numbers of a given additive persistence==
The additive persistence of a number, however, can become arbitrarily large (proof: for a given number formula_4, the persistence of the number consisting of formula_4 repetitions of the digit 1 is 1 higher than that of formula_4). The smallest numbers of additive persistence 0, 1, 2, ... are:
:0, 10, 19, 199, 19999999999999999999999, ... 
The next number in the sequence (the smallest number of additive persistence 5) is 2 × 102×(1022 − 1)/9 − 1 (that is, 1 followed by 2222222222222222222222 9&#x27;s). For any fixed base, the sum of the digits of a number is at most proportional to its logarithm; therefore, the additive persistence is at most proportional to the iterated logarithm, and the smallest number of a given additive persistence grows tetrationally.

==Functions with limited persistence==
Some functions only allow persistence up to a certain degree.

For example, the function which takes the minimal digit only allows for persistence 0 or 1, as you either start with or step to a single-digit number.

<text>The Galton Laboratory of National Eugenics was a laboratory established for the research of eugenics, later to the study of biometry and statistics, and eventually human genetics based at University College London (UCL) in London, England. The laboratory was originally established in 1904 and existed in name until 2020.

== History ==

=== The Eugenics Record Office ===
The Eugenics Record Office, a precursor to the Galton Laboratory, was established in 1904 by Francis Galton. In 1906 Karl Pearson took directorship of The Eugenics Record Office, eventually dissolving it. During its operation, The Eugenics Record Office employed three staffers: Dr. Edgar Schuster (Galton Research Fellow, 1905–1906), David Heron (Galton Research Fellow, 1906), and Ethel Elderton (Research Assistant and Secretary, 1905–1907). In 1907 the Office was reconstituted as the Galton Eugenics Laboratory as part of UCL, still under the direction of Karl Pearson a professor of Applied mathematics.

=== The Department of Applied Statistics and Eugenics ===
The Galton Laboratory was financed by Francis Galton. On his death in 1911, Francis Galton left his estate to the University of London to fund a permanent Chair of Eugenics filled by Karl Pearson. Pearson created the Department of Applied Statistics which combined the Biometric Laboratory and the Francis Galton Laboratory for National Eugenics, in 1913 this department was renamed the Department of Applied Statistics and Eugenics.

The department&#x27;s increase in size prompted UCL to acquire or construct a new space. In 1912 Sir Herbert Bartlett offered space in the North-West front of UCL&#x27;s Wilkins building. The outbreak of the First World War interrupted work and the new space was not used by the department until October 1919, with an official opening in June 1920.

Pearson was succeeded as Galton Professor by R. A. Fisher in 1934. When Fisher moved to Cambridge in 1944 the laboratory was incorporated in an enlarged Department of Eugenics, Biometry and Genetics headed by J. B. S. Haldane, the Wheldon Professor of Biometry. This reversed a previous split in 1933 following Karl Pearson&#x27;s retirement.

=== The Department of Human Genetics and Biometry ===
The Galton Laboratory underwent many changes during the post-war period. Most notably this period saw another renaming of the department following negative associations of eugenics after World War II. This renaming was by Harry Harris in 1966, where it then became the Department of Human Genetics and Biometry.

The Department of Human Genetics and Biometry, including the Galton Laboratory, became part of the Department of Biology in UCL in 1996. MRC Human Biochemical Genetics Unit was established by Harris in 1962. He was Honorary Director until he went to Philadelphia in 1976, and the unit continued under the direction of David Hopkinson until its closure in October 2000. Sam Berry also held a Professorship in Genetics from 1972.

In 1967 the laboratory moved into a dedicated new building Wolfson House along with a further two Medical Research Council units: the Human Biochemical Genetics Unit, headed by Harris, and the MRC Experimental Genetics Unit, headed by Hans Grüneberg. Subsequently, on Grüneberg&#x27;s retirement, the space occupied by his unit was reallocated to the newly created MRC Mammalian Development Unit, led by Anne McLaren, and the MRC Blood Group Unit, headed by Ruth Sanger, and subsequently Patricia Tippett.

In 2013 the Galton Laboratory was incorporated into UCL&#x27;s then new Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment.

== The Galton Laboratory and its Legacy at UCL ==
In 2018, then President and Provost of UCL, Professor Michael Arthur established a formal inquiry into the history of eugenics at UCL. The Inquiry was chaired by Professor Iyiola Solanke, of the University of Leeds and included sixteen members. The original inquiry set out six terms of reference. 
In June 2020, UCL issued a formal apology for its history and legacy of eugenics. This followed a report and comprehensive set of recommendations given to UCL in February 2020 from its official Inquiry into the History of Eugenics. Additionally, UCL announced that the institution would be denaming spaces and buildings named after Francis Galton and Karl Pearson. The spaces included the former Galton Lecture Theatre, the Pearson Lecture Theatre, and the Pearson Building. Nine of the inquiry&#x27;s original sixteen members did not agree to sign this report.

The MORE Group recommendations was an additional report compiled by nine of the inquiry&#x27;s members who did not agree to sign off on the Feb 2020 report. Reasons cited by members of the MORE Group for their refusal to sign the Feb 2020 report included a need for more time to develop the narrative of the report, a deeper understanding of UCL&#x27;s eugenics history and a broader set of terms that gave equal weight and understanding to all targets of eugenics.

The inquiry group published one additional group report in April 2021 co-chaired by Professor Hazel Genn and Dr. Kamna Patel. This report synthesised the original February 2020 report with the further recommendations of the MORE Group. The most recent report was released in November 2021 focused on further research undertaken by the inquiry.

<doc id="624714" wikidata="Q1477639" url="?curid=624714" title="Thomson scattering">
<text>Thomson scattering is the elastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by a free charged particle, as described by classical electromagnetism. It is the low-energy limit of Compton scattering: the particle&#x27;s kinetic energy and photon frequency do not change as a result of the scattering. This limit is valid as long as the photon energy is much smaller than the mass energy of the particle: formula_1, or equivalently, if the wavelength of the light is much greater than the Compton wavelength of the particle (e.g., for electrons, longer wavelengths than hard x-rays).

==Description of the phenomenon== 
Thomson scattering is a model for the effect of electromagnetic fields on electrons when the field energy formula_2 is much less than the rest mass of the electron formula_3. In the model the electric field of the incident wave accelerates the charged particle, causing it, in turn, to emit radiation at the same frequency as the incident wave, and thus the wave is scattered. Thomson scattering is an important phenomenon in plasma physics and was first explained by the physicist J. J. Thomson. As long as the motion of the particle is non-relativistic (i.e. its speed is much less than the speed of light), the main cause of the acceleration of the particle will be due to the electric field component of the incident wave. In a first approximation, the influence of the magnetic field can be neglected. The particle will move in the direction of the oscillating electric field, resulting in electromagnetic dipole radiation. The moving particle radiates most strongly in a direction perpendicular to its acceleration and that radiation will be polarized along the direction of its motion. Therefore, depending on where an observer is located, the light scattered from a small volume element may appear to be more or less polarized.

The electric fields of the incoming and observed wave (i.e. the outgoing wave) can be divided up into those components lying in the plane of observation (formed by the incoming and observed waves) and those components perpendicular to that plane. Those components lying in the plane are referred to as &quot;radial&quot; and those perpendicular to the plane are &quot;tangential&quot;. (It is difficult to make these terms seem natural, but it is standard terminology.)

The diagram on the right depicts the plane of observation. It shows the radial component of the incident electric field, which causes the charged particles at the scattering point to exhibit a radial component of acceleration (i.e., a component tangent to the plane of observation). It can be shown that the amplitude of the observed wave will be proportional to the cosine of χ, the angle between the incident and observed waves. The intensity, which is the square of the amplitude, will then be diminished by a factor of cos2(χ). It can be seen that the tangential components (perpendicular to the plane of the diagram) will not be affected in this way.

The scattering is best described by an emission coefficient which is defined as &quot;ε&quot; where &quot;ε&quot; &quot;dt&quot; &quot;dV&quot; &quot;d&quot;Ω &quot;dλ&quot; is the energy scattered by a volume element formula_4 in time &quot;dt&quot; into solid angle &quot;d&quot;Ω between wavelengths &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;λ&quot;+&quot;dλ&quot;. From the point of view of an observer, there are two emission coefficients, &quot;ε&quot;&quot;r&quot; corresponding to radially polarized light and &quot;ε&quot;&quot;t&quot; corresponding to tangentially polarized light. For unpolarized incident light, these are given by:
formula_5

where formula_6 is the density of charged particles at the scattering point, formula_7 is incident flux (i.e. energy/time/area/wavelength), formula_8 is the angle between the incident and scattered photons (see figure above) and formula_9 is the Thomson cross section for the charged particle, defined below. The total energy radiated by a volume element formula_4 in time &quot;dt&quot; between wavelengths &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;λ&quot;+&quot;dλ&quot; is found by integrating the sum of the emission coefficients over all directions (solid angle):
formula_11

The Thomson differential cross section, related to the sum of the emissivity coefficients, is given by
formula_12
expressed in SI units; q is the charge per particle, m the mass of particle, and formula_13 a constant, the permittivity of free space. (To obtain an expression in cgs units, drop the factor of 4&quot;ε&quot;0.) Integrating over the solid angle, we obtain the Thomson cross section
formula_14
in SI units.

The important feature is that the cross section is independent of light frequency. The cross section is proportional by a simple numerical factor to the square of the classical radius of a point particle of mass &quot;m&quot; and charge &quot;q&quot;, namely
formula_15

Alternatively, this can be expressed in terms of formula_16, the Compton wavelength, and the fine structure constant:
formula_17

For an electron, the Thomson cross-section is numerically given by:
formula_18

== Examples of Thomson scattering ==

The cosmic microwave background contains a small linearly-polarized component attributed to Thomson scattering. That polarized component mapping out the so-called E-modes was first detected by DASI in 2002.

The solar K-corona is the result of the Thomson scattering of solar radiation from solar coronal electrons. The ESA and NASA SOHO mission and the NASA STEREO mission generate three-dimensional images of the electron density around the Sun by measuring this K-corona from three separate satellites.

In tokamaks, corona of ICF targets and other experimental fusion devices, the electron temperatures and densities in the plasma can be measured with high accuracy by detecting the effect of Thomson scattering of a high-intensity laser beam. An upgraded Thomson scattering system in the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator uses to emit multiple pulses in quick succession. The intervals within each burst can range from 2 ms to 33.3 ms, permitting up to twelve consecutive measurements. Synchronization with plasma events is made possible by a newly added trigger system that facilitates real-time analysis of transient plasma events.

In the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect, where the photon energy is much less than the electron rest mass, the inverse-Compton scattering can be approximated as Thomson scattering in the rest frame of the electron.

Models for X-ray crystallography are based on Thomson scattering.

<text>Edward L. G. &quot;Ted&quot; Bowell (born 1943 in London, died August 21 2023 in Flagstaff, Arizona), was an American astronomer. Bowell was educated at Emanuel School London, University College, London, and the University of Paris.

He was principal investigator of the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS). He has discovered a large number of asteroids, both as part of LONEOS and in his own right before LONEOS began. Among the latter are the Jovian asteroids 2357 Phereclos, 2759 Idomeneus, 2797 Teucer, 2920 Automedon, 3564 Talthybius, 4057 Demophon, and 4489 Dracius. He also co-discovered the periodic comet 140P/Bowell-Skiff and the non-periodic comet C/1980 E1.

The outer main-belt asteroid 2246 Bowell was named in his honor. The official naming citation was published on 1 January 1981 ().

<text>The Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar is an American passenger transport aircraft of the World War II era, developed as part of the Model 10 Electra family, specifically from the Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra.

==Design and development==
Sales of the 10–14 passenger Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra, which first flew in 1937, had proved disappointing, despite the aircraft&#x27;s excellent performance, as it was more expensive to operate than the larger Douglas DC-3, already in widespread use. In order to improve the type&#x27;s economics, Lockheed decided to stretch the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage by , allowing an extra two rows of seats to be fitted.

The prototype for the revised airliner, designated Model 18 by Lockheed, was converted from the fourth Model 14, one of a batch which had been returned to the manufacturer by Northwest Airlines after a series of crashes. The modified aircraft first flew in this form on 21 September 1939, another two prototypes being converted from Model 14s, with the first newly built Model 18 flying on 2 February 1940.

A total of 625 Lodestars of all variants were built.

==Operational history==
The Lodestar received its Type certificate on 30 March 1940, allowing it to enter service with the first customer, Mid-Continent Airlines that month. As hoped, the extra seats greatly improved the Model 18&#x27;s economics, reducing its seat-mile costs to a similar level to that of the DC-3, while retaining superior performance. Despite this, sales to US domestic customers were relatively slow as most US airlines were already committed to the DC-3, with only 31 Lodestars going to US airlines. Overseas sales were a little better, with the biggest airline customers being South African Airways (21), New Zealand National Airways Corporation (13), Trans-Canada Air Lines (12) and BOAC (9); another 29 were bought by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force. Various Pratt &amp; Whitney and Wright Cyclone powerplants were installed.

When the United States started to build up its military air strength in 1940–41, many American-operated Lodestars were impressed as the C-56. This was followed by the construction of many new-build Lodestars which were flown by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the C-60 and by the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps as the R5O. Lend-lease aircraft were used by the RNZAF as transports.

One was purchased in 1942 to serve as Brazilian President Getúlio Vargas&#x27; personal aircraft. This aircraft was specially designed for that purpose and had 11 seats.

After the war many Lodestars were overhauled and returned to civilian service, mostly as executive transports such as Dallas Aero Service&#x27;s DAS Dalaero conversion, Bill Lear&#x27;s Learstar (produced by PacAero), and Howard Aero&#x27;s Howard 250. A few of the latter were converted to tricycle landing gear.

While the surviving New Zealand NZNAC aircraft were sold back overseas in 1951/52, six more were later imported and converted for aerial topdressing.

A single Lodestar served with the Israeli Air Force during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.

A number of skydiving operations in the United States used Lodestars during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Accidents and incidents==

Between 1941 and 1944, the Panair do Brasil airline suffered 4 accidents involving the Lodestar which resulted in a total of 57 fatalities.

In January 1943, Lockheed Lodestar Mk.II EW986, c/n 2154, in the service of the Royal Air Force, overshot and crashed 3 km south of Heliopolis, Egypt. At least 12 crew members and passengers died in the crash. A cause of the accident was not determined. Among those killed were Air Vice-Marshal Wilfred Ashton McClaughry, CB, DSO, MC, DFC and Lady Rosalinde Tedder née MacLardy, wife of Marshal of the Royal Air Force Arthur William Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder, GCB.

In 1949, a Lockheed Lodestar in airline service in Australia crashed immediately after takeoff. All 21 occupants died in the crash or the ensuing conflagration. The cause of the accident was determined to be that the center of gravity was behind the rear limit. It is also likely the elevator trim tab was set for landing rather than takeoff.

On 20 December 1956, Alden G. Roach, president of the Consolidated Western Steel and the Columbia-Geneva-Steel Divisions of U.S. Steel, pilot and co-pilot crash near Tyrone, Pennsylvania, Model 18-56, N 1245V, U.S. Steel owned company plane. Causes unknown.

On 22 March 1958, Mike Todd&#x27;s private plane Lucky Liz, named after his wife Elizabeth Taylor, crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered engine failure while being flown overloaded, in icing conditions at too-high an altitude for the loading. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all four on board..

On 4 September 1962, a Lockheed 18-56-24 Lodestar operated by the Ashland Oil and Refining Company crashed near Lake Milton, Ohio. The flight was in-route to Ashland Regional Airport (KDWU) from Buffalo Airport, NY. Eleven passengers and two crew-members were killed. Investigation determined the crash a result of a malfunction of the electric elevator trim tab, which caused the loss of the plane&#x27;s right wing during flight.

On 21 August 1983, a Lockheed L-18 LEARStar operated by Landry Aviation, Inc. crashed near Silvana, Washington. The flight was a planned parachute drop carrying two pilots and 22 parachutists. Nine parachutists and two crew-members were killed while 13 were able to parachute to safety after the pilots lost control and entered a vertical descent from 12,500 feet. Investigation determined the crash a result of a failure of the operator and pilot-in-command to assure proper load distribution during the parachute drop.

<text>John Lamberton Bell (born 1949) is a Scottish hymn-writer and Church of Scotland minister. He is a member of the Iona Community, a broadcaster, and former student activist. He works throughout the world, lecturing in theological colleges in the UK, Canada and the United States, but is primarily concerned with the renewal of congregational worship at the grass roots level.

==Student activism==
Bell studied at the University of Glasgow where in 1974 he was elected President of the Students&#x27; Representative Council. His election represented a significant development as it was the start of a few years&#x27; control by the left wing of the SRC. Bell was quite open about his Christian religious beliefs, wearing a wooden pectoral cross.

In 1977 he was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow, while he was still a student. This was part of a trend for student rectors in Scotland at that time (which included Gordon Brown at the University of Edinburgh) but the rules were later changed to prevent students from standing for this post.

==Music career==
After a period in the Netherlands and two posts in church youth work, Bell became employed full-time in the areas of music and worship with the Wild Goose Resource Group. He is a past convener of the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Panel on Worship and also convened the committee to revise the Church Hymnary. In 1987, he wrote the hymn &quot;The Summons&quot;.

In 1999, Bell was honoured by the Presbyterian Church in Canada and the Royal School of Church Music which bestowed a Fellowship on him. In 2002, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Glasgow.

Bell has produced (sometimes in collaboration with Graham Maule) many collections of original hymns and songs and two collections of songs of the World Church. These are published by the Iona Community in Scotland and by G.I.A. Publications (Chicago) in North America. Several collections of his work have been published in translation in Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Dutch, Frisian, Japanese and German.

==Broadcasting==
He is a frequent broadcaster, and often presents programmes on the BBC, majoring on contemporary religious songs from various parts of the world. He is quite a regular contributor to &quot;Thought for the Day&quot;, part of Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme.

In 2005, the BBC apologised for a broadcast by Bell in which he said that a Muslim corporal he had met who had been conscripted into the Israeli army had been jailed for refusing to shoot Palestinian children. Neither the BBC nor the Israeli military were able to find any evidence supporting the story or the existence of a soldier fitting the description. It was further pointed out that Israeli Arabs are not subject to conscription. Bell acknowledged that two parts of his story were incorrect: the part about conscription had been an assumption on his part and he had misstated the person&#x27;s age. He said: &quot;I perfectly understand that at a time when Jewish sensitivity in Britain is running high because of anti-Semitism that part of my remarks might have been interpreted as furtive racism. However, such a conjecture would be completely untrue.&quot;

==Public speaking==
Bell speaks to audiences across the world.
In the UK, he has been associated with the Christian Arts Festival Greenbelt for many years.

==Personal life==
In 2017, responding to the suicide of Lizzie Lowe who was afraid to tell her parents about her sexuality, John Bell came out as gay during an address at Greenbelt Festival. He had remained single because he believed that this enabled him to work without hindrance or compromise as a public Christian and fulfil his commitments in the area of worship in the Church of Scotland.

Since 2021, Bell is a patron of the Open Table Network, an ecumenical Christian community for LGBT people and their allies.

==Honours==
In 2018, Bell received the Cranmer Award for Worship from Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, &quot;for his outstanding Christian witness, through hymn-writing, broadcasting and social action.&quot;

==Selected works==
===Church Hymnary (Fourth Edition)===
John Bell was the Convener (and music editor) of the committee which drafted the Church of Scotland&#x27;s Church Hymnary (Fourth Edition). The committee first met in 1994; the Fourth Edition was finally published in 2005. Music edition:

<doc id="624739" wikidata="Q334951" url="?curid=624739" title="Catenation">
<text>In chemistry, catenation is the bonding of atoms of the same element into a series, called a &quot;chain&quot;. A chain or a [[Ring (chemistry)|ring] may be &quot;open&quot; if its ends are not bonded to each other (an [[open-chain compound]]), or &quot;closed&quot; if they are bonded in a ring (a [[cyclic compound]]). The words &quot;to catenate&quot; and &quot;catenation&quot; reflect the Latin root &quot;&quot;, &quot;chain&quot;.

==Carbon==
Catenation occurs most readily with [[carbon]], which forms [[covalent bond]]s with other carbon atoms to form long chains and structures. This is the reason for the presence of the vast number of organic compounds in nature. Carbon is most well known for its properties of catenation, with [[organic chemistry]] essentially being the study of catenated carbon structures (and known as catenae). Carbon chains in [[biochemistry]] combine any of various other elements, such as [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[biometal (biology)|biometals]], onto the backbone of carbon.

However, carbon is by no means the only element capable of forming such catenae, and several other [[main-group element]]s are capable of forming an expansive range of catenae, including [[hydrogen]], [[boron]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], [[sulfur]] and [[Halogen|halogens]].

The ability of an element to catenate is primarily based on the [[bond energy]] of the element to itself, which decreases with more diffuse orbitals (those with higher [[azimuthal quantum number]]) overlapping to form the bond. Hence, carbon, with the least diffuse [[valence shell]] p orbital is capable of forming longer p-p [[sigma bond]]ed chains of atoms than heavier elements which bond via higher valence shell orbitals. Catenation ability is also influenced by a range of [[steric]] and electronic factors, including the [[electronegativity]] of the element in question, the [[molecular orbital]] n and the ability to form different kinds of covalent bonds. For carbon, the sigma overlap between adjacent atoms is sufficiently strong that perfectly stable chains can be formed. With other elements this was once thought to be extremely difficult in spite of plenty of evidence to the contrary.

==Hydrogen==
Theories of the [[Properties of water#Structure|structure of water]] involve three-dimensional networks of tetrahedra and chains and rings, linked via [[hydrogen bonding]].

A polycatenated network, with rings formed from metal-templated hemispheres linked by hydrogen bonds, was reported in 2008.

In [[organic chemistry]], hydrogen bonding is known to facilitate the formation of chain structures. For example, [[4-tricyclanol]] C10H16O shows catenated hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl groups, leading to the formation of helical chains; crystalline [[isophthalic acid]] C8H6O4 is built up from molecules connected by hydrogen bonds, forming infinite chains.

In unusual conditions, a 1-dimensional series of hydrogen molecules confined within a single wall [[carbon nanotube]] is expected to become metallic at a relatively low pressure of 163.5 GPa. This is about 40% of the ~400 GPa thought to be required to [[metallic hydrogen|metallize]] ordinary hydrogen, a pressure which is difficult to access experimentally.

==Silicon==
[[Silicon]] can form sigma bonds to other silicon atoms (and [[disilane]] is the parent of this class of compounds). However, it is difficult to prepare and isolate SinH2n+2 (analogous to the saturated alkane [[hydrocarbon]]s) with n greater than about 8, as their [[thermal stability]] decreases with increases in the number of silicon atoms. Silanes higher in molecular weight than disilane decompose to polymeric [[polysilicon hydride]] and [[hydrogen]]. But with a suitable pair of organic substituents in place of hydrogen on each silicon it is possible to prepare [[silanes|polysilanes]] (sometimes, erroneously called polysilenes) that are analogues of [[alkane]]s. These long chain compounds have surprising electronic properties - high [[electrical conductivity]], for example - arising from sigma [[delocalization]] of the electrons in the chain.

Even silicon–silicon pi bonds are possible. However, these bonds are less stable than the carbon analogues. [[Disilane]] and [[Binary silicon-hydrogen compounds|longer silanes]] are quite reactive compared to [[Alkane|alkanes]]. [[Disilene]] and disilynes are quite rare, unlike [[alkene]]s and [[alkyne]]s. Examples of [[disilyne]]s, long thought to be too unstable to be isolated were reported in 2004.

== Boron ==
In dodecaborate(12) anion, twelve [[boron]] atoms covalently link to each other to form an icosahedral structure. Various other similar motifs are also well studied, such as [[boranes]], [[Carborane|carboranes]] and [[Dicarbollide|metal dicarbollides]].

== Nitrogen ==
[[Nitrogen]], unlike its neighbor carbon, is much less likely to form chains that are stable at room temperature. But, there do exist nitrogen chains; for example, in solid nitrogen, [[triazane]], [[Azide|azide anion]] and [[Triazole|triazoles]]. Longer series with eight or more nitrogen atoms, such as [[1,1&#x27;-Azobis-1,2,3-triazole]], have been synthesized. These compounds have potential use as a convenient way to store large amount of energy.

==Phosphorus==
[[Phosphorus]] chains (with organic substituents) have been prepared, although these tend to be quite fragile. Small [[Ring (chemistry)|rings]] or [[Atom cluster|clusters]] are more common.

==Sulfur==
The versatile chemistry of elemental [[sulfur]] is largely due to catenation. In the native state, sulfur exists as [[Allotropes of sulfur|S8]] molecules. On heating these rings open and link together giving rise to increasingly long chains, as evidenced by the progressive increase in [[viscosity]] as the chains lengthen. Also, sulfur polycations, sulfur polyanions ([[Polysulfide|polysulfides]]) and [[lower sulfur oxides]] are all known. Furthermore, [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] show variants of these structural motifs. 

==Semimetallic elements==
In recent years, a variety of double and triple bonds between semi-metallic elements have been reported, including [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[arsenic]] and [[bismuth]]. The ability of certain main group elements to catenate is currently the subject of research into [[inorganic polymer]]s.

== Halogens ==
Except for [[fluorine]] that can only form unstable polyfluorides at low temperature, all other stable halogens (Cl, Br, I) can form several [[Polyhalogen ions|isopolyhalogen anions]] that are stable at room temperature, of which the most prominent example being [[triiodide]]. In all these anions, the halogen atoms of the same element bond to each other.

<doc id="624740" wikidata="Q950598" url="?curid=624740" title="Archetype (Fear Factory album)">
<text>Archetype is the fifth studio album by American industrial metal band Fear Factory. It was the first album by the band not to feature Dino Cazares, with Christian Olde Wolbers handling both bass and guitar duties. It was released on April 20, 2004, through Liquid 8. It debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard 200 chart and is their highest charting album to date.

The album was also issued in a limited edition digipak with a bonus DVD. Depending on where the digipak was obtained, the bonus DVD is either for their &quot;Australian Tour 2004&quot; and the video for &quot;Cyberwaste&quot; or one entitled &quot;The Making of Archetype&quot;. Some, though not all, versions of the bonus digipak also included a gold ticket that gave the owner a chance to meet Fear Factory live.

Christian Olde Wolbers noted the main influences for the record were Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Undisputed Attitude&quot;, Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Mutter&quot; and Mnemic&#x27;s &quot;Mechanical Spin Phenomena&quot;.

==Track listing==


==Song interpretations==
*&quot;Slave Labor&quot; contains references to the self-immolation of a person against the corporate world.
*&quot;Cyberwaste&quot; contains references to anonymous Internet users who antagonize other users only because they are &quot;safe behind the cyberscreen&quot;.
*The title track &quot;Archetype&quot; is directed at then ex-guitarist Dino Cazares: &quot;The infection has been removed/The soul of this machine has improved.&quot; Frontman Burton C. Bell stated that Archetype,&#x27; defines what Fear Factory is, completely. It has classic Fear Factory parts, and the heavy/melodic vocals, but without being forced or contrived.&quot;

==Popular culture==
*&quot;Bite the Hand That Bleeds&quot; was used in the film &quot;Saw&quot; and the music video is a bonus feature on one of the versions of the DVD.
*&quot;Slave Labor&quot; is featured on &quot;UFC: Ultimate Beat Downs, Vol. 1&quot;.
*The album and its title song are referenced in the game &quot;Fallout 3&quot; on one of the terminals, where a certain &quot;B. Bell&quot; reports on a terminal that the virus on the &quot;Archetype FF06&quot; mainframe has been cleaned, and that &quot;the infection has been removed, the soul of this machine has improved&quot;.
*A remixed version of the song &quot;Archetype&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to OVA &quot;&quot;.
*The official music video of the song &quot;Archetype&quot; was featured as a bonus unlockable in Capcom&#x27;s game &quot;Final Fight: Streetwise&quot; (PS2/Xbox).
