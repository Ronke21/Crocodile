<text>Alan Grant (9 February 194920 July 2022) was a Scottish comic book writer known for writing Judge Dredd in &quot;2000 AD&quot; as well as various Batman titles from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. He was the co-creator of the characters Anarky, Victor Zsasz, and the Ventriloquist.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Alan Grant was born in Bristol, but moved with his family to Newtongrange, Midlothian, at the age of one. According to Grant, his grandmother taught him how to read and write by introducing him to material from DC Thomson, which also served as his introduction to comics. He attended Newtongrange Primary School and Dalkeith High School, where he was frequently expelled and reinstated. After leaving school, he worked briefly in a bank.

===Early career and &quot;2000 AD&quot;===
Grant first entered the comics industry in 1967 when he became an editor for D.C. Thomson before moving to London from Dundee in 1970 to work for IPC on various romance magazines.

After going back to college and having a series of jobs, Grant found himself back in Dundee and living on Social Security. He then met John Wagner, another former D.C. Thomson editor, who was helping put together a new science fiction comic magazine for IPC, &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and was unable to complete his other work. Wagner asked Grant if he could help him write the &quot;Tarzan&quot; comic he was working on; so began the Wagner/Grant writing partnership.

Wagner asked Grant to write a strip for &quot;Starlord&quot;, a &quot;2000 AD&quot; spin off, which eventually got Grant noticed within IPC. On a trip to London, Grant was introduced to Kelvin Gosnell, then editor of &quot;2000 AD&quot;, who offered Grant an editorial position on the comic. One of Grant&#x27;s first jobs was to oversee the merger of &quot;2000 AD&quot; and &quot;Tornado&quot;, an unsuccessful boys adventure comic magazine. Grant featured as a character in the magazine in the form of ALN-1, Tharg&#x27;s Scottish Robot assistant. Grant found himself in conflict with IPC and resigned to become a freelance writer, writing the occasional issue of &quot;Future Shock&quot; and &quot;Blackhawk&quot;.

Grant then formed his partnership with Wagner after the pair lived and worked together; the pair eventually co-wrote &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;. They worked on other popular strips for the magazine, including &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot; and &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; using the pseudonym T.B. Grover. Grant worked on other people&#x27;s stories, changing and adding dialogue, most notably &quot;Harry Twenty on the High Rock&quot;, written by Gerry Finley-Day.

&quot;Judge Dredd&quot; was Grant&#x27;s main concern for much of the 1980s. Grant and Wagner had developed the strip into the most popular in &quot;2000 AD&quot; as well as creating lengthy epic storylines such as &quot;The Apocalypse War&quot;.

Grant wrote for other IPC comic magazines such as the revamped &quot;Eagle&quot;.

===American work in the 1980s===
By the late 1980s, Grant and Wagner were about to move into the American comic market. Their first title was the 12-issue &quot;Outcasts&quot; limited series (Oct. 1987–Sept. 1988) for DC Comics. Although it was not a success, it paved the way for the pair to write Batman stories in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; from issue 583 (Feb. 1988), largely with Norm Breyfogle on art duties across the various Batman titles. Grant and Wagner introduced the Ventriloquist in their first Batman story and the Ratcatcher in their third. After a dozen issues, Wagner left Grant as sole writer. Grant was one of the main Batman writers until the late 1990s. He stated that Wagner left after five issues because the title did not sell well enough to give them royalties, and that Wagner&#x27;s name was kept in the credits for the remaining seven issues because Grant was afraid DC would fire him.

The pair created a four issue series for Epic Comics called &quot;The Last American&quot;. This series, as well as the &quot;Chopper&quot; storyline in &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, was blamed for the breakup of the Wagner/Grant partnership. The pair split strips, with Wagner keeping &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and Grant keeping &quot;Strontium Dog&quot; and &quot;Judge Anderson&quot;. Grant and Wagner continued to work together on special projects such as the Batman/Judge Dredd crossover &quot;Judgement on Gotham&quot;.

During the late 1980s, Grant experienced a philosophical transformation and declared himself an anarchist. The creation of the supervillain Anarky was initially intended as a vehicle for exploring his political opinions through the comic medium. In the following years, he continued to utilize the character in a similar fashion as his philosophy evolved into social anarchism.

===1990s===

Grant&#x27;s projects at the start of this decade included writing &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Strontium Dog&quot;, &quot;The Bogie Man&quot;, a series co-written by Wagner which was the pair&#x27;s first venture into independent publishing, and &quot;Lobo&quot;, a character created by Keith Giffen as a supporting character in &quot;Omega Men&quot;.

&quot;Lobo&quot; gained his own four-issue miniseries in 1990 which was drawn by Simon Bisley. This was a parody of the &#x27;dark, gritty&#x27; comics of the time and proved hugely popular. After several other miniseries (all written by Grant, sometimes with Giffen as co-writer), Lobo received his own ongoing series. In addition, Grant was writing &quot;L.E.G.I.O.N.&quot; (a &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; spin-off) and &quot;The Demon&quot; (a revival of Jack Kirby&#x27;s character) for DC Comics. Grant wrote the first issues of the new Batman title, &quot;&quot;, which saw him create three new characters, Jeremiah Arkham, Mr. Zsasz, and Amygdala. This story arc, &quot;&quot;, was later accompanied by his role as one of the main writers during the &quot;&quot; crossover. In 1994, Grant co-wrote the &quot;Batman-Spawn: War Devil&quot; intercompany crossover with Doug Moench and Chuck Dixon. Other Batman storylines which Grant contributed to include &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Grant was part of the creative team for the short-lived weekly title &quot;Toxic!&quot; and was a consultant on the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;. Due to the sheer volume of work he was doing, Grant let a new generation of writers try their hand on strips like &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; and &quot;Robo-Hunter&quot;. This often proved to be unsuccessful, however, and Grant found himself again writing for &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

In the mid 1990s, Grant underwent a second philosophical transformation, declaring himself a follower of Neo-Tech, a philosophy created by Frank R. Wallace. When he was given the opportunity to create an &quot;Anarky&quot; mini-series, he redesigned the character accordingly. Following the success of the series, he was hired to create an ongoing monthly series for the character. Initially hesitant, he was persuaded to do so by series illustrator, Anarky co-creator, and personal friend, Norm Breyfogle. Named after the protagonist, &quot;Anarky&quot; was mired by what Grant felt was constant editorial interference, became a critical and financial failure, and was canceled after eight issues. Although he disliked the 1999 series, he considered the original &quot;Anarky&quot; mini-series to be among his &quot;career highlights.&quot;

By the end of the decade Grant had written for virtually every American publisher of comic books, including DC, Marvel and Dark Horse.

===2000s===
Grant became involved with writing scripts for animation as well as his comic work, notably working on &quot;Action Man&quot; cartoons as well as original anime. He remained the main writer for &quot;Judge Anderson&quot; and &quot;Robo-hunter&quot; and teamed up with Wagner for a new &quot;Bogie Man&quot; story for the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;. He formed his own publishing company, Bad Press Ltd, which released the humour title &quot;Shit the Dog&quot;, written by Grant and drawn by Simon Bisley.

Grant was one of the few professional comics writers to contribute to fanzines such as &quot;FutureQuake&quot;. He provided scripts for the now defunct Scottish underground comic Northern Lightz. Along with his wife Sue, he organised the annual Moniaive Comics Festival. He wrote two comic-based novels, &quot;The Stone King,&quot; (2001) featuring Batman and the Justice League of America, and &quot;Last Sons,&quot; (2006) featuring Superman, Martian Manhunter and Lobo. From 1998, he wrote scripts for Renga Media and later wrote the screenplay for &quot;Dominator X&quot;.

He wrote &quot;Kidnapped&quot;, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson, with art by Cam Kennedy, published by Waverley Books. It was part of a project revolving around Edinburgh being the first UNESCO City of Literature in 2007 and various editions will be produced some of which will be handed out for free. A version with text adapted for reluctant readers will be published simultaneously by Barrington Stoke, and a Scots language translation by Matthew Fitt called &quot;Kidnappit&quot; was published by Itchy Coo. If things go well more adaptations may be in the works, although a sequel project based on &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; was commissioned due to the relatively high profile and warm reception of the &quot;Kidnapped&quot; adaptation. It was being promoted as part of the One Book – One Edinburgh 2008 campaign.

In November 2008, Grant&#x27;s Bad Press released the comics anthology, &quot;Wasted&quot;. A mixture of drug-themed humour and anarchic cartoon action stories, mostly, but not all, written by Grant. &quot;Wasted&quot; featured art by many comic artists from the UK underground and mainstream art scene. These included well-known industry figures like Frank Quitely, Jamie Grant, Jon Haward, and Mark Stafford. The comic showcased many underground artists like Zander, Colin Barr, Tiberius Macgregor, Alan Kerr, and Curt Sibling. &quot;Wasted&quot; was seen as the heir to the previous Northern Lightz comics, but gained mixed reviews upon release.

Grant set up his own comics publishing company Berserker Comics, the first title was &quot;The Dead: Kingdom of Flies&quot; with another, &quot;Church of Hell&quot;, published in 2009. Both have Simon Bisley on art duties. Grant was a part of Renegade Arts Entertainment which, with Berserker Comics, was co-publishing &quot;Channel Evil&quot;, a four-issue mini-series with art by Shane Oakley.

===2010s===
In 2013 Grant teamed with Robin Smith to create &quot;Scott vs Zombies&quot;, commissioned by Edinburgh&#x27;s Artlink with support from Creative Scotland. In 2012, he completed the award-winning Canadian children&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;The Loxleys and the War of 1812&quot;, now in its second edition.

In 2016 Grant and John Wagner created a new comic for &quot;BHP Comics&quot;. Drawn by Dan Cornwell &quot;Rok of the Reds&quot; tells the story of a dangerous intergalactic outlaw, Rok of Arkadi, who, while on the run, hides on Earth by taking over the body and life of troubled football star Kyle Dixon.

In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Grant led a local community project in the village of Moniaive to produce a comic about the virus and the residents&#x27; community spirit.

==Awards==
Grant received an Inkpot Award in 1992.

==Personal life==
Grant was married to Sue Grant, and had a daughter, Shalla. The Grants lived in Moniaive, Dumfriesshire. He died on 20 July 2022, survived by Sue, Shalla and four grandchildren.

<doc id="618804" wikidata="Q162544" url="?curid=618804" title="Glechoma hederacea">
<text>Glechoma hederacea is an aromatic, perennial, evergreen creeper of the mint family Lamiaceae. It is commonly known as ground-ivy, gill-over-the-ground, creeping charlie, alehoof, tunhoof, catsfoot, field balm, and run-away-robin. It is also sometimes known as creeping jenny, but that name more commonly refers to &quot;Lysimachia nummularia&quot;. It is used as a salad green in many countries.

European settlers carried it around the world, and it has become a well-established introduced and naturalized plant in a wide variety of localities. It is also considered an aggressive invasive weed of woodlands and lawns in some parts of North America. In the absence of any biological control research conducted by the USDA, herbicides are relied upon (despite their drawbacks) particularly for woodland ecosystems. The plant&#x27;s extensive root system makes it difficult to eradicate by hand-pulling.

&quot;Glechoma hederacea&quot; can be identified by its round to reniform (kidney- or fan-shaped), crenate (with round-toothed edges) opposed leaves diameter, on long petioles attached to square stems that root at the nodes. The plant spreads either by stolon or seed, making it exceptionally difficult to eradicate. It is a variable species, its size being influenced by environmental conditions, from tall.

The flowers of &quot;G. hederacea&quot; are bilaterally symmetrical, funnel shaped, blue or bluish-violet to lavender, and grow in opposed clusters of two or three flowers in the leaf axils on the upper part of the stem or near the tip. It usually flowers in the spring.

=== Reproduction ===
&quot;Glechoma hederecea&quot; is gynodioecious, with genets being either female or hermaphrodite. The females depend upon pollen from hermaphrodites for pollination. Female flowers tend to be smaller than hermaphrodite flowers. Disagreement exists among biologists as to whether hermaphrodite flowers can pollinate themselves. The plant spends the winter as either a small ramet or a small rosette. It produces flowers between April and July, which are visited by many types of insects, and can be characterized by a generalized pollination syndrome. Each pollinated flower can produce up to four seeds, which are dispersed by the stem bending over and depositing the ripe seeds in the ground adjacent to the parent plant, although ants may carry the seeds further. The seeds germinate a few days after contact with moisture, although they can be stored dry. Dry storage for a period up to a month is thought to improve the germination rate.

The plant can also reproduce clonally, with the stems bending down to the earth and allowing roots to attach themselves. Single clones can grow several metres across, although precise data are not available.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;G. hederacea&quot; is sometimes confused with common mallow (&quot;Malva neglecta&quot;), which also has round, lobed leaves, but mallow leaves are attached to the stem at the back of a rounded leaf, where ground ivy has square stems and leaves, which are attached in the center of the leaf, more prominent rounded lobes on their edges, attach to the stems in an opposite arrangement, and have a hairy upper surface. In addition, mallow and other creeping plants sometimes confused with ground ivy do not spread from nodes on stems. In addition, ground ivy emits a distinctive odor when damaged, being a member of the mint family.

== Distribution and habitat ==
European settlers carried it around the world, and it has become a well-established introduced and naturalized plant in a wide variety of localities. It is also considered an aggressive invasive weed of woodlands and lawns in some parts of North America, being considered a non-native plant in the United States, and invasive in some U.S. states. It has invaded wild areas, sometimes choking out native wildflowers.

&quot;G. hederacea&quot; thrives in moist shaded areas, but also tolerates sun very well. It is a common plant in grasslands and wooded areas or wasteland. It also thrives in lawns and around buildings, since it survives mowing. Part of the reason for its wide distribution is its rhizomatous method of reproduction.

==Ecology==
A number of wild bees collect pollen from this plant, including &quot;Anthophora furcata&quot;, &quot;Anthidum manicatum&quot;, &quot;Anthophora plumipes&quot;, &quot;Anthophora quadrimaculata&quot;, &quot;Osmia aurulenta&quot;, &quot;Osmia caerulentes&quot;, and &quot;Osmia uncinata&quot;. The plant is also galled by several insects, including &quot;Rondaniola bursaria&quot; (lighthouse gall), &quot;Liposthenes glechomae&quot; or &quot;Liposthenes latreillei&quot; (Kieffer, 1898) (a gall wasp).

It forms dense mats that can take over areas of lawn and woodlands, thus is considered an invasive or aggressive weed in suitable climates where it is not native.

=== Control ===
A non-native invasive in North America, &quot;Glechoma&quot; is familiar to a large number of people as a weed, a property it shares with many others of the mint family. It can be a problem in heavy, rich soils with good fertility, high moisture, and low boron content. It thrives particularly well in shady areas where grass does not grow well, such as woodlands, although it can also be a problem in full sun.

Because the plant is stoloniferous and continues to spread from its roots or bits of stem which reroot, even small infestations resist repeated hand weeding. Like crabgrass, &quot;G. hederacea&quot;&#x27;s root has a tough-to-remove ball (unbelied by its delicate wide leaves).

No biological control agents are known to help to reduce its spread in North America. Commercial herbicides containing triclopyr are used to control the plant.

&quot;G. hederacea&quot; is also unusually sensitive to boron, and can be killed by applying borax (sodium tetraborate) in solution. However, borax is toxic to ants and to animals at only slightly higher concentrations, and does not break down in the environment. In addition to adverse long-term effects on soil or groundwater, recent research discounts the very efficacy of borax treatment, primarily because finding the correct concentration for a given area is difficult and the potential for damaging desired plants is high.

== Safety ==
Although it has been used by humans as a salad green and in herbal medicines for thousands of years, the species is also believed to be toxic to livestock, particularly horses. Wild pigs, however, are reported to feed on it. Some accounts report it is toxic to rodents, while bank voles in Great Britain have been observed to use it as a food source. Like other members of the Lamiaceae, &quot;G. hederacea&quot; contains bioactive volatile oils, including terpenoids and pulegone; these are responsible for the characteristic &quot;minty&quot; odor and taste of plants in the mint family. Their activity in humans varies depending on many factors, including concentration, quantity of intake, and whether administration is internal or external. Lamiacaeae plants with very high volatile oil concentrations, such as European pennyroyal (&quot;Mentha pulegium&quot;), have traditional uses as disinfectants, flea-killers, and abortifacients, and are hepatotoxic to humans. Other members of the Lamiacaeae, such as &quot;Mentha spicata&quot;, spearmint, are widely and safely used in teas and flavorings for their volatile oils. The concentration of volatile oil in &quot;G. hederacea&quot; is less than 1/30th that in European pennyroyal. The effects of &quot;Glechoma&quot; on humans have been little studied.

== Uses ==

It is grown as a garden plant in pots and occasionally as a groundcover. Easily cultivated, it grows well in shaded places. A variegated variety is commercially available; in many areas, this is the dominant form, which has escaped cultivation and become established as an aggressive, adventitious groundcover.

The pre-bloom leaves can be cooked as a vegetable or made into tea.

&quot;G. hederacea&quot; was also widely used by the Saxons in brewing ale as flavoring, clarification, and preservative, and later by the English, before the introduction of hops into brewing in the late 15th century. From this, the brewing-related names arose for the herb, e.g. alehoof, tunhoof, and gill-over-the-ground. In the 18th century, beer brewed with ground ivy was known as &quot;gill ale&quot; and was said to have medicinal properties.

Enzymes similar to chymosin in &quot;G. hederacea&quot; have been used in the cheese-making process as a substitute for animal rennet.

===Traditional medicine===
&quot;G. hederacea&quot; has been used in the traditional medicine of Europe going back thousands of years; Galen recommends the plant to treat inflammation of the eyes. John Gerard, an English herbalist, recommended it to treat tinnitus, and as a &quot;diuretic, astringent, tonic, and gentle stimulant. Useful in kidney diseases and for indigestion.&quot; It has also been used as a &quot;lung herb&quot;. Its presence as an invasive weed in North America is the result of the value placed on it by European settlers as a medicinal herb and ale preservative; the species was imported and widely cultivated in herb and kitchen gardens. Its other traditional uses include as an expectorant or astringent, and to treat bronchitis. In traditional Austrian medicine, the herb has been prescribed for internal application as salad or tea for the treatment of a variety of different conditions, including disorders associated with the liver and bile, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, kidneys and urinary tract, fever, and influenza.

<text>Shengqiang () is a concept in Chinese opera which helps to categorize its hundreds of regional genres by the music played during arias. Classifying by the music, as opposed to the regional dialect, also helps to understand a genre&#x27;s evolutionary history. For example, Peking opera and Cantonese opera have little in common as far as language or place of origin, but they belong to the same &quot;shengqiang&quot; system. Today, the four major &quot;shengqiang&quot; (四大声腔 pinyin: Sìdà Shēngqiāng) are &quot;Bangziqiang&quot;, &quot;Pihuangqiang&quot;, &quot;Kunqiang&quot; and &quot;Gaoqiang&quot; (i.e. &quot;Yiyangqiang&quot;). Not all Chinese opera genres fall into one of these four &quot;shengqiang&quot; systems, and many genres can be classified into more than one system. Other &quot;shengqiang&quot; in history include &quot;Yuyaoqiang&quot; and &quot;Haiyanqiang&quot;.

==Bangzi qiang==
Bangziqiang (梆子腔) consists of Qinqiang (秦腔), Yu opera (豫剧), Jinju (晋剧), Hebei Bangzi (河北梆子), Sixianqiang in Dianju (滇剧的丝弦腔), Tanxi in Chuanju (川剧的弹戏), etc.

==Pihuang qiang==
Pihuang qiang (皮黄腔, a coinage made from xipi and erhuang) comprises Huiju (徽剧 Hui theatre), Hanju (汉剧), Beijing opera (京剧), Cantonese opera (粤剧), Xiangju (湘剧), Chuanju (川剧), Dianju (滇剧), etc.

==Kun qiang==
Kunqiang (崑腔), also known as Kunshanqiang (崑山腔), or Kunqu (崑曲) was listed as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2001.

==Yiyang qiang (Gao qiang)==
Yiyang qiang (弋陽腔) or outside Peking called Gao qiang (高腔) consists of Teochew opera (潮剧), Sichuan opera (川剧), Xiangju (湘剧 also in Pihuangqiang), Ganju (赣剧), Dianju (滇剧 again also in Pihuang qiang), Chenhexi (辰河戏), Diaoqiang (调腔), etc.

<doc id="618816" wikidata="Q1702321" url="?curid=618816" title="Johnny Evers">
<text>John Joseph Evers (July 21, 1881 – March 28, 1947) was an American professional baseball second baseman and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1902 through 1917 for the Chicago Cubs, Boston Braves, and Philadelphia Phillies. He also appeared in one game apiece for the Chicago White Sox and Braves while coaching them in 1922 and 1929, respectively.

Evers was born in Troy, New York. After playing for the local minor league baseball team for one season, Frank Selee, manager of the Cubs, purchased Evers&#x27;s contract and soon made him his starting second baseman. Evers helped lead the Cubs to four National League pennants, including two World Series championships. The Cubs traded Evers to the Braves in 1914; that season, Evers led the Braves to victory in the World Series, and was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

Evers continued to play for the Braves and Phillies through 1917. He then became a coach, scout, manager, and general manager in his later career.

Known as one of the smartest ballplayers in MLB, Evers also had a surly temper that he took out on umpires. Evers was a part of a great double-play combination with Joe Tinker and Frank Chance, which was immortalized as &quot;Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance&quot; in the poem &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot;. Evers was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1946.

==Early life==
Evers was born on July 21, 1881, in Troy, New York. His father worked as a saloon keeper. Many of Evers&#x27; relatives, including his father, brothers, and uncles, played baseball. Evers attended St. Joseph&#x27;s Elementary School and played sandlot ball in Troy.

==Career==

===Minor league career===
Evers made his professional debut in minor league baseball for the Troy Trojans of the Class-B New York State League in 1902 as a shortstop. Evers reportedly weighed less than , and opposing fans thought he was a part of a comedic act. Evers reportedly weighed no more than during his career.

Evers batted .285 and led the New York State League with 10 home runs. Frank Selee, manager of the Chicago Cubs, scouted Evers&#x27;s teammate, pitcher Alex Hardy. Selee, also looking for a second baseman due to an injury to starter Bobby Lowe, purchased Hardy&#x27;s and Evers&#x27;s contracts for $1,500 ($ in current dollar terms); the Trojans were willing to sell Evers&#x27;s services due to his temper.

===Chicago Cubs===
Evers made his MLB debut with the Cubs on September 1 at shortstop, as Selee moved Joe Tinker from shortstop to third base. Only three players in the National League (NL) were younger than Evers: Jim St. Vrain, Jimmy Sebring, and Lave Winham. Three days later, Selee returned Tinker to shortstop and assigned Evers to second base. In his month-long tryout with the Cubs, Evers batted .222 without recording an extra-base hit and played inconsistent defense. However, Lowe&#x27;s injury did not properly heal by spring training in 1903, allowing Evers to win the starting job for the 1903 season. Lowe recovered during the 1903 season, but Evers&#x27; strong play made Lowe expendable; Evers finished third in the NL in fielding percentage among second basemen (.937), and finished fifth in assists (245) and putouts (306). The Cubs sold Lowe to the Pittsburgh Pirates after the season. Evers played 152 games in the 1904 season. Defensively, his 518 assists and 381 putouts led the NL, though his 54 errors led all NL second basemen.

During the 1906 season, Evers finished fifth in the NL with 49 stolen bases, and led the league with 344 putouts and led all second basemen with 44 errors. The Cubs won the NL pennant in 1906, but lost the 1906 World Series to the Chicago White Sox four games to two; Evers batted 3-for-20 (.150) in the series. During the 1907 season, Evers led the NL with 500 assists. The Cubs repeated as NL champions in 1907, and won the 1907 World Series over the Detroit Tigers, four games to none, as Evers batted 7-for-20 (.350).
During the 1908 pennant race, Evers alerted the umpires to Fred Merkle&#x27;s baserunning error in a game against the New York Giants, which became known as &quot;Merkle&#x27;s Boner&quot;. Al Bridwell hit what appeared to be the game-winning single for the Giants, while Merkle, the baserunner on first base, went to the clubhouse without touching second base. Evers called for the ball, and the umpire ruled Merkle out. NL president Harry Pulliam ruled the game a tie, with a makeup to be played. The Cubs won the makeup game, thereby winning the pennant. The Cubs then won the 1908 World Series over Detroit, four games to one, as Evers again batted 7-for-20 (.350). For the 1908 season, Evers had a .300 batting average, good for fifth in the NL, and a .402 on-base percentage, second only to Honus Wagner.

Evers drew 108 walks during the 1910 season, trailing only Miller Huggins. However, Evers missed the end of the season with a broken leg. Without Evers, the Cubs won the NL pennant, but lost the 1910 World Series to the Philadelphia Athletics, four games to one. Evers agreed to manage the Navy Midshipmen, a college baseball team, in 1911, despite the opposition of Cubs&#x27; manager Frank Chance. He experienced a nervous breakdown in 1911; returning to the Cubs later in the season, he played in only 46 games that year. Evers indicated that this was a result of a business deal that cost Evers most of his savings. Evers rebounded to bat .341 in 1912, good for fourth in the NL, and he led the NL with a .431 on-base percentage. Team owner Charles W. Murphy named Evers manager in 1913, signing him to a five-year contract, succeeding Chance.

===Boston Braves and Philadelphia Phillies===
After the 1913 season, Evers was offered $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to jump to the Federal League, but he opted to take less money to remain with the Cubs. In February 1914, after Evers signed his players to contracts, Murphy fired Evers as manager and traded him to the Boston Braves for Bill Sweeney and Hub Perdue. Murphy insisted that Evers had resigned as manager, which Evers denied. Evers insisted he was a free agent, but the league assigned him to the Braves. He signed a four-year contract at $10,000 per season ($ in current dollar terms), with a $20,000 signing bonus.

During the 1914 season, the Braves fell into last place of the eight-team NL by July 4. However, the Braves came back from last place in the last ten weeks of the season to win the NL pennant. Evers&#x27; .976 fielding percentage led all NL second basemen. The Braves defeated the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1914 World Series, four games to none, as Evers batted 7-for-16 (.438). Evers won the Chalmers Award, the forerunner of the modern-day Most Valuable Player award, ahead of teammate Rabbit Maranville.

Evers was limited in 1915 by injuries, and also served suspension for arguing with umpires. After a poor season in 1916, Evers began the 1917 season with a .193 batting average. Due to Evers&#x27; declining performance, the Braves placed Evers on waivers at mid-season, and he was claimed by the Philadelphia Phillies. Evers rejected an offer to become manager of the Jersey City Skeeters of the International League that offseason. He signed with the Boston Red Sox as a player-coach for the 1918 season, but was released without playing a game for them. Not receiving another offer from an MLB team, Evers traveled to Paris as a member of the Knights of Columbus to promote baseball in France.

===Coaching and managing career===
In 1920, Evers was slated to become head baseball coach at Boston College, however he instead accepted a last minute offer to join the New York Giants as a coach. He managed the Cubs again in 1921, succeeding Fred Mitchell. With the team struggling, Evers was fired in August and replaced with Bill Killefer. The Cubs finished seventh out of eight in the NL that season.

Evers served as a coach for the Chicago White Sox in 1922 and 1923. He returned to second base in 1922, filling in for an injured Eddie Collins. Evers played in one game for the White Sox as Collins recovered.
Evers was named the White Sox acting manager for the 1924 season, succeeding Chance, who had been hired as manager during the offseason, was ordered home before the season began, due to poor health. However, Evers suffered from appendicitis during the season, missing time during the year, and the White Sox opened up a managerial search when Chance died in September. The White Sox replaced Evers with Collins after the season.

Evers rejoined the Braves as a scout. As Braves owner Emil Fuchs sold manager Rogers Hornsby to the Cubs and assumed managerial duties himself for the 1929 season, Fuchs hired Evers as a coach. Fuchs had no experience as a field manager, and so Evers became captain of the Braves, directing the team during the game and dealing with umpires. Evers and fellow coach Hank Gowdy played in one game in the 1929 season, coming into the bottom of the ninth inning on October 6, 1929. In the process, Evers became the oldest player in the league for the year.

Evers remained a coach for the Braves under Bill McKechnie, who succeeded Fuchs as field manager in 1930, and served in the role through 1932. He continued to scout for the Braves, and then became general manager of the Albany Senators of the New York–Pennsylvania League in 1935. He resigned from Albany at the end of the season. Over his managerial career, he posted a 180–192 record.

====Managerial record====
==Personal==
Evers married Helen Fitzgibbons. His son, John J. Evers, Jr., served as a Lieutenant in World War II, assigned to the Pacific Theater of Operations. When his son was 11 years old, Evers bought part of the Albany Senators and gave him the stock. Evers&#x27; brother, Joe Evers, and uncle, Tom Evers, also played in MLB. His great-nephew is &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Tim Layden.

Though Evers and Tinker were part of one of the most successful double-play combinations in baseball history, the two despised each other off of the field. They went several years without speaking to each other after one argument. When Chance once named Tinker the smartest ballplayer he knew, Evers took it as a personal affront.

==Later life==
Evers operated a sporting goods store in Albany, New York in 1923. However, Evers lost his money and filed for bankruptcy in 1936. The store was passed down to Evers&#x27; descendants. He also worked as superintendent of Bleecker Stadium in Albany and spent time teaching baseball to sandlot players.

Evers suffered a stroke in August 1942, which paralyzed the right side of his body. He remained bedridden or confined to a wheelchair for most of the next five years. Evers died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1947 at St. Peter&#x27;s Hospital in Albany, and is buried in Saint Mary&#x27;s Cemetery in Troy.

==Legacy==

Evers retired in 1918, having batted .300 or higher twice in his career, stolen 324 bases and scored 919 runs. He frequently argued with umpires and received numerous suspensions during his career. His combative play and fights with umpires earned him the nickname &quot;The Human Crab&quot;.

Evers served as the pivot man in the &quot;Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance&quot; double-play combination, which inspired the classic baseball poem &quot;Baseball&#x27;s Sad Lexicon&quot;, written by &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot; newspaper columnist Franklin Pierce Adams in July 1910. Evers, Tinker, and Chance were all inducted in the Hall of Fame in the same year.

The Merkle play remains one of the most famous in baseball history. The ball used in the Merkle play was sold at an auction in the 1990s for $27,500, making it one of the four most valuable baseballs based on purchase price. Evers&#x27; role in Merkle&#x27;s boner cemented his legacy as a smart ballplayer.

Evers is mentioned in the 1949 poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash:

<doc id="618817" wikidata="Q121046819" url="?curid=618817" title="The Derbyshire Blues">
<text>The Derbyshire Blues were a militia regiment raised in Derby by the Duke of Devonshire in response to the invasion by Charles Edward Stuart (&#x27;Bonnie Prince Charlie&#x27;) in 1745. As Lord Lieutenant of Derbyshire, the Duke had responsibility for raising a militia in defence of the realm, and as a member of the Whig aristocracy he was opposed to any attempt to usurp King George II. The Militia Act 1745 made provision for calling out the militia in England during the Jacobite rising, and on 13 September 1745 the Government sent letters directing the lord-lieutenants of counties in England and Wales to call out the militia. A meeting had taken place on 28 September at the George Inn, a coaching inn in Iron Gate, &quot;to consider of such measures as are fit to be taken for the support of the Royal Person and government of H. M. King George, and our happy constitution in Church and State, at a time when rebellion is carrying on in favour of a Popish Pretender.&quot; The name of the militia is derived from the colour of their blue uniform, intended to distinguish the militia from regular soldiers in red uniform.

The Duke arrived in Derby from Chatsworth with his son, the Marquess of Hartington, towards the end of November 1745 (the Jacobites had entered Preston on the 26th), and used the George Inn as his headquarters. He reviewed 600 men in two regiments of 300 men each, raised by subscription by the gentlemen of Derby and Derbyshire, and 120 men raised and paid for by the Duke himself. The regiments were led by Sir Nathaniel Curzon and the Marquess of Hartington. However, these troops withdrew towards Nottingham on 3 December on the news that Charles Edward Stuart had entered Ashbourne, approximately 13 miles away, with 9000 men.

When the prince arrived in Derby on 4 December, he called at the inn and demanded billets for his troops. The event is re-enacted every year on the anniversary of the Prince&#x27;s arrival.

==The George Inn==
The inn is now a public house called &quot;Jorrocks&quot;, having had several different names since the 1980s. First, it changed from &quot;The George&quot; to &quot;Mr. Jorrocks&quot;, only to be renamed &quot;Lafferty’s&quot; during a fad period for Irish theme pubs, and &quot;Mr Jorrocks&quot; for a while in the 2000s, before taking on its current name.

<text>The Fort Wayne Komets are a minor league ice hockey team, which currently plays in the ECHL. They play their home games at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In all of North American professional hockey, only the Original Six teams of the NHL and the Hershey Bears of the AHL have played continuously in the same city with the same name longer than the Komets.

==History==
There have been two different hockey teams known as the Fort Wayne Komets. The original Komets franchise was founded in 1952 in the International Hockey League. In 1990 they moved to Albany, New York and became the Albany Choppers. They only played part of one season in Albany before folding on February 15, 1991.

The second team was founded in 1985 in Flint, Michigan where they were known as the Flint Spirits. In 1990, only two days after the first Komets team left Fort Wayne, the Franke family of Fort Wayne bought the Flint Spirits, moved them to Fort Wayne, and took the Komets name and history. From 1985-1999 they also played in the IHL, then in 1999 they moved to the United Hockey League (UHL). In 2007 the UHL changed its name to the International Hockey League, which became available when the previous IHL ceased operations in 2001. In 2010 that league also ceased operations, and the Komets joined the Central Hockey League (CHL) along with the surviving members of their former league. In 2012 they left the CHL for their current league, the ECHL.

==Affiliations==
For the 2014–15 season, the Komets entered into a one-year affiliation with the Colorado Avalanche of the NHL, providing a direct line to Colorado&#x27;s American Hockey League affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters. After a successful season and partnership proving beneficial to all parties, on July 21, 2015, the Komets announced a continuance of the affiliation with the Avalanche and new AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage on a two-year deal through the 2015–16 and 2016–17 seasons. However, the Avalanche and Komets mutually agreed to end the affiliation one season early in 2016. After a season operating independently of an affiliation, the Komets agreed to a one-year affiliation deal with the Arizona Coyotes and their AHL affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners, but did not extend the affiliation after the deal ended.

On August 21, 2018, the Komets announced a new one-year affiliation agreement with the NHL&#x27;s Vegas Golden Knights and AHL affiliate Chicago Wolves. The affiliation was later extended for the 2019–20 season. The affiliation with the Golden Knights ended on May 19, 2022.

On July 27, 2022, the Komets announced a new affiliation agreement with the NHL&#x27;s Edmonton Oilers and their AHL affiliate, the Bakersfield Condors.

On May 28, 2024, the Komets and Edmonton Oilers extended their affiliation agreement for the 2024-25 season.

<text>Triclopyr (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyloxyacetic acid) is an organic compound in the pyridine group that is used as a systemic foliar herbicide and fungicide.

== Uses ==
Triclopyr is a selective weedkiller used to control dicotyledonous weeds (i.e. broadleaf plants) while leaving monocotyledonous plants (mostly bulbs, grasses and conifers) unaffected, or to control rust fungus on soybean crops.

In the USA, it is sold under the trade names Garlon, Remedy, Turflon, Weed-B-Gon (purple label), Brush-B-Gon among others, and in the UK as SBK Brushwood Killer.

It is a major ingredient in Confront, which was withdrawn from most uses because of concerns about compost contamination from the other major ingredient, clopyralid.

== Environmental effects ==
Triclopyr breaks down in soil with a half-life between 30 and 90 days. It degrades rapidly in water, and remains active in decaying vegetation for about 3 months.

The compound is slightly toxic to ducks (LD50 = 1698 mg/kg) and quail (LD50 = 3000 mg/kg). It has been found nontoxic to bees and marginally toxic to fish (rainbow trout LC50 (96 hr) = 117 ppm).

Garlon&#x27;s fact sheet for their triclopyr ester product indicates that triclopyr is highly toxic to fish, aquatic plants, and aquatic invertebrates, and should never be used in waterways, wetlands, or other sensitive habitats. This is only for the triclopyr ester product, not for the triclopyr amine product.

<doc id="618820" wikidata="Q1379779" url="?curid=618820" title="Mike Lazaridis">
<text>Mihal &quot;Mike&quot; Lazaridis (born March 14, 1961) is a Greek Canadian businessman, investor in quantum computing technologies, and co-founder of Research In Motion, which created and manufactured the BlackBerry wireless handheld device. In November 2009, &quot;Canadian Business&quot; ranked Lazaridis as the 11th wealthiest Canadian, with an estimated net worth of billion (equivalent to $billion in ).

Lazaridis served in various positions including co-chairman and co-CEO of BlackBerry from 1984 to 2012 and Board Vice Chair and Chair of the Innovation Committee from 2012 to 2013. As an advocate for the power of basic science to improve and transform the world, he co-founded Quantum Valley Investments in March 2013 with childhood friend and BlackBerry co-founder Douglas Fregin to provide financial and intellectual capital for the further development and commercialization of breakthroughs in quantum information science. In 1999 he founded the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, where he also serves as board chair. In 2002, he founded the Institute for Quantum Computing. He is also a former chancellor of the University of Waterloo, and an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC).

== Personal life, education and career history ==
Lazaridis was born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Pontic Greek parents, Nick and Dorothy Lazaridis with original lineage to the island of Chios. He was five years old when his family moved to Canada in 1966, settling in Windsor, Ontario. At age 12, he won a prize at the Windsor Public Library for reading every science book in the library.

In 1979, he enrolled at the University of Waterloo in electrical engineering with an option in computer science. In 1984, Lazaridis responded to a request for proposal from General Motors (GM) to develop a network computer control display system. GM awarded him a contract. He dropped out of university that year, just two months before he was scheduled to graduate. The GM contract, a small government grant, and a loan from Lazaridis&#x27;s parents enabled Lazaridis, Mike Barnstijn, and Douglas Fregin to launch Research In Motion. One of the company&#x27;s first achievements was the development of barcode technology for film. RIM plowed the profits from that into wireless data transmission research, eventually leading to the introduction of the BlackBerry wireless mobile device in 1999, and its better-known version in 2002.

In 2020, he purchased the 80 m (262 ft) yacht Artefact. The custom build by the shipyard Nobiskrug won awards for its exterior design, and for using hybrid electric technologies.

Lazaridis and his wife Ophelia have also been noted for their philanthropic work in the Waterloo area.

== Philanthropy ==
In 2000, Lazaridis founded and donated more than $170 million to the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. He and his wife Ophelia founded and donated more than $100 million to the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in 2002. In 2015, Lazaridis donated $20 million to Wilfrid Laurier University for a new technology-focused management institute at the business school, which was renamed in his honour as the Lazaridis School of Business &amp; Economics.

== Popular culture ==
Lazaridis is portrayed by Jay Baruchel in the 2023 film &quot;BlackBerry&quot;.

== Awards and honours ==
On October 21, 1999, Lazaridis received an honorary doctor of engineering degree from the University of Waterloo, and in June 2003, he became its eighth chancellor. He was listed on &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; Honour Roll as a distinguished Canadian in 2000 and named &quot;Canada&#x27;s Nation Builder of the Year&quot; for 2002 by readers of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; newspaper. In 2006, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and a member of the Order of Ontario. In 2014 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His nomination reads:Father of what has become known as the smartphone, Mike Lazaridis is recognized in the global wireless community as a visionary, innovator and engineer of extraordinary talent. He is the founder of RIM and the creator of the BlackBerry. Since 1999, he has made the primary donations establishing the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) and the University of Waterloo Quantum-Nano Centre. The Perimeter Institute has already become an international beacon for theoretical physics and IQC is widely regarded as the leading centre of quantum information science worldwide. Together, these institutes have transformed physics in Canada and made a major impact internationally.

Lazaridis received an Academy Award in 1999 for technical achievements relating to the creation of a high-speed barcode reader used in film editing. The same invention received an Emmy in 1994.

<text>Daniel P. Abnett ( ; born 12 October 1965) is an English comic book writer and novelist. He has been a frequent collaborator with fellow writer Andy Lanning, and has worked on books for both Marvel Comics, and their UK imprint, Marvel UK, since the 1990s, and also &quot;2000 AD&quot;. He has also contributed to DC Comics titles, and his &quot;Warhammer Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; novels and graphic novels for Games Workshop&#x27;s Black Library now run to several dozen titles and have sold over two million copies. In 2009 he released his first original fiction novels through Angry Robot books.

==Early life==
Daniel P. Abnett was born in Rochester, Kent, on 12 October 1965. Abnett read English and matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford in 1984, and graduated from there in 1987.

==Career==
As one of the more prolific &quot;2000 AD&quot; writers, Abnett was responsible for the creation of one of the comic&#x27;s better known and longest-running strips, &quot;Sinister Dexter&quot;. Other original stories include &quot;Black Light&quot;, &quot;Badlands&quot;, &quot;Atavar&quot;, &quot;Downlode Tales&quot;, &quot;Sancho Panzer&quot;, &quot;Roadkill&quot;, &quot;Wardog&quot; based on the game of the same name, &quot;Kingdom&quot; and &quot;Brink&quot;. Abnett has also contributed to some of the comic&#x27;s major ongoing series, including &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;, &quot;Durham Red&quot; and &quot;Rogue Trooper&quot;.

His work for Marvel includes runs on &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Death&#x27;s Head 2&quot;, &quot;Battletide&quot;, &quot;Knights of Pendragon&quot; (all of which he co-created), &quot;The Punisher&quot;, &quot;War Machine&quot;, &quot;Annihilation: Nova&quot; and various &quot;X-Men&quot; titles, as well as several stories for the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip.

At DC he is probably best known for his 2000 relaunch of &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; as the limited series &quot;Legion Lost&quot; and then the ongoing series &quot;The Legion&quot;. His work for DC is usually co-written with Andy Lanning and they are often referred to as DnA. The two co-created the Resurrection Man character with artist Jackson Guice in 1997.

For Dark Horse Comics he co-wrote &quot;Planet of the Apes: Blood Lines&quot; with Ian Edginton, as well a penning &quot;Lords of Misrule&quot; and &quot;HyperSonic&quot;.

Abnett&#x27;s &quot;First &amp; Only&quot; was one of the first novels published by Games Workshop&#x27;s Black Library. His other novels set in Games Workshop&#x27;s Military science fiction-themed &quot;Warhammer 40,000&quot; universe include the Gaunt&#x27;s Ghosts series, the Eisenhorn and Ravenor trilogies, and more recently, as part of the Horus Heresy series, the SF best-sellers &quot;Horus Rising&quot;, &quot;Legion&quot;, &quot;Prospero Burns&quot;, &quot;Know No Fear&quot; and &quot;The End and the Death Volumes I, II &amp; III&quot;. He has also authored four comic strip series, collected as graphic novels, for Games Workshop&#x27;s Black Library imprint in the volumes &quot;Damnation Crusade&quot;, &quot;Lone Wolves&quot;, &quot;Inquisitor Ascendant&quot; and &quot;Titan&quot;.

Having written the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas &quot;The Harvest&quot; and &quot;Nocturne&quot; for Big Finish&#x27;s series. He also authored &quot;Everyone Says Hello&quot;, an audio drama based on &quot;Torchwood. He authored a &#x27;Border Princes&quot;, a &quot;Torchwood&quot; novel, and the framing device of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; anthology &quot;The Story of Martha&quot;.

In 1994, he wrote a promotional comic to promote the opening of the Nemesis roller coaster at Alton Towers.

===2000s work===

At &quot;2000 AD&quot; he finished the final book of &quot;The V.C.s&quot; and started &quot;Black Atlantic&quot; in the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;, which was drawn by Steve Roberts (seen working on &quot;Bec &amp; Kawl&quot;) in black and white.

In 2008 Abnett and Lanning took over &quot;The Authority&quot; as part of the World&#x27;s End relaunch of the core Wildstorm titles.

In addition, Abnett has done a lot of work on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;cosmic&quot; characters. They expanded on their work in &quot;Annihilation: Nova&quot; and &quot;Nova&quot;, and piloted the next big event &quot;&quot;. They said &quot;we were approached by Andy Schmidt, who edited the first &#x27;Annihilation&#x27; event, and asked to pilot the next event, which Bill Rosemann is editing.&quot; They ended up writing the Prologue, the &quot;Nova&quot; series crossover and the main &quot;Annihilation: Conquest&quot; limited series. The characters then became the core of a new Guardians of the Galaxy.

In June 2008, Abnett and Lanning signed an exclusive deal with Marvel, which they hoped would give them time to work on the &quot;cosmic&quot; characters they have been dealing with, as well as more earth-based ones. The contract allowed them to finish existing commitments, so they will be able to finish their fifteen issue run on &quot;The Authority&quot;. In addition Marvel has allowed the contract to include &quot;a couple of exceptions that are not direct competition, for example, Dan&#x27;s 2000AD work in the UK and his Games Workshop novels.&quot; The first major work to emerge after this deal will be &quot;War of Kings&quot;, a crossover storyline, emerging from Secret Invasion, that pitches Black Bolt (and the Inhumans) against Gabriel Summers (and the Shi’ar Empire) but also draws in other teams and characters, including Nova, the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Starjammers. This then led straight into &quot;Realm of Kings&quot; which deals with how the different groups deal with the fallout from the events in &quot;War of Kings&quot; and this, in turn, was followed by &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot;. DnA have also written an &quot;Iron Man/Thor&quot; limited series.

He and Lanning have also written &quot;Fusion&quot;, a crossover series between Marvel and Top Cow.

He also started &quot;Insurrection&quot;, a series in &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; that aimed &quot;to bring to the Dredd Universe something of the epic war-in-space scale of the stuff I write for Warhammer 40K.&quot;

Abnett wrote the screenplay for Games Workshop and Codex Pictures&#x27;s CGI film &quot;&quot; released in 2010.

===2010s work===
Abnett concluded &quot;Insurrection&quot; and began a new series in the same milieu, &quot;Lawless&quot;, also in the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot;. Meanwhile, in &quot;2000 AD&quot; he has continued &quot;Kingdom&quot;, contributed &quot;Grey Area&quot; and began another new series, &quot;Brink&quot;. He also began writing both the &quot;Aquaman&quot; and &quot;Titans&quot; titles for the DC Rebirth branding, including the crossover storyline &quot;The Lazarus Contract&quot;, which he coauthored with Christopher Priest and Benjamin Percy.

===Original fiction===
On 19 March 2009, HarperCollins&#x27; science fiction, fantasy and horror imprint, Angry Robot, announced the acquisition of three original novels by Abnett. They were &quot;Triumff: Her Majesty&#x27;s Hero&quot;, a story set in the alternative history reign of Elizabeth XXX and &quot;Embedded&quot;, a near future war story with a journalist protagonist, which would have a follow-up set in the same setting. Only two novels were published.

==Bibliography==

Dan Abnett has been writing comics and novels since the mid-1980s, producing hundreds of comic stories and dozens of novels.

&quot;Cannon&quot;,&quot; Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Blue Light&quot;, &quot;Custer&quot;, the 1976 western &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;Kojak&quot;, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Hart To Hart&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, and &quot;Father Murphy&quot;. In 1983, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series for &quot;The Mississippi&quot;.

==Politics==
Penn supported the Hollywood trade unions and refused to accuse others to the House Un-American Activities Committee in their investigation of suspected Communist infiltration of the film industry. He was subsequently blacklisted, and Paramount refused to renew his contract. As a result, Penn was not able to work as a movie actor. He found acting work in television, but CBS ousted him after receiving an anonymous accusation that he had addressed a Communist political meeting. Barred from acting in film or TV, he became a director.

==Personal life and death==
Penn married Eileen Ryan in 1957, and they had three sons: Michael Penn, Sean Penn, and Chris Penn. He died from lung cancer at Saint John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on September 5, 1998, at the age of 77.

<text>Andy Lanning is an English comic book writer and inker, known for his work for Marvel Comics and DC Comics, and for his collaboration with Dan Abnett.

==Career==
Lanning works primarily at Marvel Comics and DC Comics as an inker. He has also pencilled books, such as his creation &quot;The Sleeze Brothers&quot;.

Lanning&#x27;s writing has included his and Abnett&#x27;s 2000 relaunch of DC&#x27;s title &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;. The two co-created the Resurrection Man character with artist Jackson Guice in 1997.

Lanning and Abnett also collaborated on an ongoing &quot;Nova&quot; series for Marvel, which premiered in 2007. The duo previously authored a &quot;Nova&quot; miniseries as a tie-in for the Marvel crossover Annihilation, starring Richard Rider, now the only member of the Xandarian Nova Corps. This led into their piloting the &quot;&quot; storyline, and the core characters from this went on to form the new Guardians of the Galaxy.

Lanning teamed up with Abnett to relaunch &quot;The Authority&quot;, with Simon Coleby on art, as part of the World&#x27;s End relaunch of the core Wildstorm titles.

It was announced at Wizard World Chicago in June 2008 that Abnett and Lanning had signed an exclusive deal with Marvel, which they hoped would give them time to work on the &quot;cosmic&quot; characters they dealt with, as well as more earth-based ones. The contract allows them to finish existing commitments, so they will be able to finish their fifteen issue run on &quot;The Authority&quot;. Their first major work which followed this was &quot;War of Kings&quot;, which depicted the &quot;cosmic&quot; aftermath of Secret Invasion. He also wrote the three-issue Marvel/Top Cow crossover miniseries &quot;Fusion&quot;.

In 2020 Lanning collaborated with Ron Marz on the nine-issue DC Comics crossover storyline &quot;Endless Winter&quot;, which would debut that December.

<doc id="618836" wikidata="Q4210774" url="?curid=618836" title="Cumberland, Ontario">
<text>Cumberland is a former municipality and now geographic township in eastern Ontario, Canada. It was an incorporated township from 1800 to 1999, when it was incorporated as the City of Cumberland, then ceased to be a separate municipality in 2001, when it was amalgamated into the city of Ottawa. It now exists only as a geographic township.

==History==

Cumberland was originally incorporated as a township in 1800. It took its name from the Duke of Cumberland (later King of Hanover).

The township comprised the eastern portion of Ottawa&#x27;s Orléans suburb as well as the communities of Cumberland Village, Carlsbad Springs, Navan, Notre-Dame-des-Champs, Sarsfield, and Vars.

Almost 200 years after it was first incorporated, Cumberland became a city in 1999. City status was short-lived however as the municipality was amalgamated with of Ottawa in 2001.

Cumberland now forms part of Ottawa. The largest portion of the former municipality now forms Orléans South-Navan Ward, previously named Cumberland Ward, and is represented at Ottawa City Council. Most of the suburban neighbourhood of Orléans, which straddled the former boundary between Cumberland and the city of Gloucester, has been split off from Cumberland and Gloucester and is now joined in Orléans East-Cumberland and Orléans West-Innes Wards. Thus, Orléans South-Navan Ward is now primarily rural in nature, made up of historic villages that now comprise bedroom communities of Ottawa.

==Attractions==
===Cumberland Heritage Village Museum===
The Cumberland Heritage Village Museum, which depicts rural life in a village setting during the 1920s and 1930s, celebrated its 35th anniversary on September 25, 2011. The museum features a General Store, one-room schoolhouse and antique vehicles at the village garage, a tractor-pulled wagon ride, and farm animals. The former Knox Presbyterian/United Church building (1904–1980) and its artefacts were relocated from Vars to the Cumberland Heritage Village Museum. A memorial Roll of Honor and plaque from the Knox Presbyterian Church are dedicated to its members who served and to those who gave their lives in the First World War. A memorial scroll from the Knox Presbyterian Church is dedicated to its members who served in the Second World War.

Every other Sunday, the Ottawa Valley Live Steamers and Model Engineers are on site to give rides on their model trains. The museum has a collection of over 20,000 artifacts, including ceramic, textile and agricultural equipment, many of which have never been on display. The museum and artifact collection were included amongst other architecturally interesting and historically significant buildings in Doors Open Ottawa in 2012.

=== Other attractions ===
A memorial stands in front of St. Andrews United Church, dedicated to soldiers who lost their lives during the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Korean War.

In 2017, Dr. Ranjit Pereira opened Humanics Sanctuary and Sculpture Park, a non-commercial art object dedicated to representation of world religions, cults and ethical teaching.

<doc id="618837" wikidata="Q403901" url="?curid=618837" title="Dumont d'Urville Station">
<text>The Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station () is a French scientific station in Antarctica on Île des Pétrels, archipelago of Pointe-Géologie in Adélie Land. It is named after explorer Jules Dumont d&#x27;Urville, whose expedition landed on Débarquement Rock in the Dumoulin Islands at the northeast end of the archipelago on January 21, 1840. It is operated by the &quot;French Polar Institute Paul-Émile Victor&quot;, a joint operation of French public and para-public agencies. It is the administrative centre of Adélie Land.

==History==

A pioneering French Antarctic research station, Port Martin, located east of D&#x27;Urville, was destroyed by fire on the night of January 23, 1952, without death or injury. In 1952, a small base was built on Île des Pétrels to study a rookery of emperor penguins. This base was called Base Marret. As the main base Port Martin was a total loss, Base Marret was chosen as overwintering site for 1952/1953. The new main base, Dumont D&#x27;Urville station, was built on the same island and opened on January 12, 1956, to serve as the centre for French scientific research during the Antarctic International Geophysical Year 1957/1958. The station has remained in active use ever since.

The station allows 30-40 people to come ashore at one time. Ice and strong katabatic winds often prevent landings, either by boat or by helicopter. The station can accommodate about 30 winter-overs and 90 during the summer. The icebreaker ship &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot; carries supplies and personnel to the station from the port of Hobart, Tasmania. It does 5 round-trips between November and March.

The Academy Award-winning documentary film &quot;La Marche de l&#x27;empereur&quot;, released in English as &quot;March of the Penguins&quot;, was filmed in the region around this base.

== Wildlife ==
One of the main interests of the base is the study of wildlife, notably the emperor penguins. In the summer, the rocks near the base serve as a refuge for the Adélie penguin, which comes here to reproduce. Skua, snow petrel, giant petrel, Cape petrel also spend the summer near the base. In the winter, only emperor penguins stay to reproduce. However, around August, giant petrels return to feed on emperor penguin chicks.

Some marine animals are equally present despite the negative temperature of the water. Among rare visitors to the archipelago, there are other species of penguins, orcas, and rorquals.

== Activity ==
The base Dumont d&#x27;Urville is first and foremost a scientific base, even if nowadays the transportation of supplies to the Concordia Station (operated together with Italian researchers) represents an important part of the activity of the base. The French Southern and Atlantic Lands (TAAF) administration, the French Polar Institute Paul-Émile Victor (IPEV) and the French Navy jointly operate the icebreaker &quot;Astrolabe&quot; which is based out of Réunion. The vessel is used both to bring personnel and supplies to the Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station and for research and patrol duties.

=== Chemistry of the atmosphere ===
The laboratory in atmospheric chemistry of the base is used to analyse, among other things, sulfur compounds present in the atmosphere.

=== Geophysics ===
Nowadays, the study of geophysics is less present in the base. Nonetheless, several tools are still in use, notably a tide gauge, a cosmic rays detector, a GPS to measure the dip of the Antarctica into the upper mantle, and a lidar, which allows the analysis of the ozone depletion and the ozone holes.

=== Logistics ===
The proper functioning of the base and supplying Concordia requires significant logistics, especially in the summer. Technicians, including electricians, plumbers, mechanics for the electric plant and auto mechanics are essential for the proper functioning of the base all year round.

In the 1950s the station had a small narrow-gauge railway for transporting supplies from a landing jetty to the main base. This was the only recorded railway ever in Antarctica.

==Climate==
Dumont d&#x27;Urville Station has an ice cap (EF) climate with conditions milder than inland. This station experienced record warm temperatures and precipitation due to an unprecedented atmospheric river event in March 2022.

<doc id="618839" wikidata="Q839783" url="?curid=618839" title="Prelog, Croatia">
<text>Prelog ( Kajkavian: &quot;Prilok&quot;) is a city in Međimurje County, in northern Croatia. The total population of the city is 4,042, with 7,027 in the city&#x27;s administrative area, making it the second most populated settlement in the county, after Čakovec.

The city is located in the southern part of Međimurje County, on the shores of the Drava River and Lake Dubrava, a reservoir on the river. The city is located 16 kilometres of the county&#x27;s capital Čakovec, to which it is connected by D20 state road.

==Population==
The city&#x27;s administrative area includes the following settlements:

* Cirkovljan, population 694
* Čehovec, population 634
* Čukovec, population 257
* Draškovec, population 539
* Hemuševec, population 224
* Oporovec, population 334
* Otok, population 303
* Prelog, population 4,042


==History==

===Beginnings===
Prelog () was first mentioned on 6 December 1264, and that date is celebrated with a local festival. The name &quot;Prelog&quot; is probably derived from the Croatian word &quot;vlak&quot;, meaning &quot;the train&quot;, &quot;pulling&quot;, or &quot;to pull&quot;, since the area attracted many visitors who intentionally came and eventually passed by in the process of transit and trade.

The place was obviously well managed and organised, so that the King of Croats and Hungarians, Matthias Corvinus, was stationed here with his army in 1480. It was a trade centre when the Zrinski family of rulers (Nikola Zrinski, Petar Zrinski, etc.) controlled the region. In 1671, Petar Zrinski was accused of treason and executed. After that, the population of Prelog decreased due to fear and suspicion of foreign German armies present nearby.

===Growth===

In 1716, however, the population started to grow. Shops were crowded with merchants, travellers and other busy people. The city became a centre for the distribution of rock salt for this part of the kingdom. There was also a silk plant, so-called &quot;filandra&quot;, which would eventually close in 1848.

The beautiful baroque Church of St. James was built in 1761, in the heyday of the city. Towards the end of the 18th century, Prelog was the most developed municipality in the present-day Međimurje region. In 1786, it was significantly bigger than Čakovec. At the time, it had a population of 1,729, while the population of Čakovec was 1,048.

===During the 19th and 20th centuries===
Strangely enough, Prelog did not benefit much from the first railroad, built in 1860, which reached westbound of Kotoriba, and ultimately reached Budapest and Rijeka. The city was simply slightly offset, only indirectly connected, and unable to benefit properly from the new means of transport.

A long period of industrial stagnation ensued. The first bank opened in 1873, and another one followed in 1905. By the end of the 19th century, the number of residents was around 4,100. The city was the seat of the Prelog district () of Zala County in the Kingdom of Hungary until the Treaty of Trianon was signed in 1920.

In the first half of the 20th century, the marginalisation of Prelog continued. It was relieved of its previous administrative functions. During World War II, it was part of Hungary again, as the entire Međimurje region was annexed by the Hungarians between 1941 and 1945.

Čakovec then overtook Prelog. However, it soon regained its confidence and began to grow again, receiving the city status from the Croatian Parliament in February 1997, five years after the country&#x27;s independence.

==Economy and education==
Today, more than 50% of the income is based on industry and manufacturing. Agriculture accounts for approximately 19% of the income, while a quarter of it is based on commerce and tourism.

Prelog&#x27;s elementary school is attended by more than 500 pupils. There is also a secondary school in the town, the only in Međimurje County that is not located in Čakovec. The secondary school offers education for jobs in tourism, catering and food processing. It is attended by more than 400 students in study courses lasting three years.

==Sports and recreation==
Prelog is considered the hometown of motorcycle speedway in Croatia, as the local speedway club was one of the country&#x27;s first organised clubs in the sport. The speedway was held at the Mladost Stadium, which hosted important events including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Team Cup in 1972, 1978 and 1996, qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship in 1973 and 1980, and the Speedway World Pairs Championship in 1974 and 1981.

There are more than 20 different sports clubs in the city and its wider area, with the most popular sports including football, tennis, basketball, table tennis, handball, etc. There is also a small airfield for powered hang gliders on the shores of the Drava, as well as a small marina on Lake Dubrava nearby, with the lake also being a popular destination for anglers.

==Culture==
Prelog is home to a monument to the Croatian ban Josip Jelačić.

<doc id="618849" wikidata="Q2526423" url="?curid=618849" title="Pixia">
<text>Pixia is a freeware raster graphics editor program for Windows, created by . It was originally designed for the anime/manga community but has also been used in other branches of art. A successor to ART/fw, a full-color graphics tool developed for Windows 3.1, ver. 0 was released in the fall of 1998 and celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2013. The program is still being upgraded at a high frequency. Although it is freeware, it has advanced functions.

In addition to Pixia, other versions were developed under the names A/PIXIA and Phierha to enhance functions, but they were never officially released. After reviewing those versions, Pixia ver. 5 was released in 2009. Ver. 5 also features significant changes in interface design, among others.

Although ver.4 continues to be supported for users who prefer the conventional interface, the focus of development has shifted to ver.6, resulting in the existence of two series of Pixia.

==Overview and features==
The program has a layer function, masks, blending planes, and transparent color planes (filter required). It supports external plug-ins to add data read/write formats and to expand functionality such as integration with other software. Filters and plug-ins are created and published by volunteers on many sites. Some attempts were made to mutually use Adobe Photoshop and Pixia filters.

For a long time, Pixia could not manage GIF files by default because the software was developed before the GIF patent expired. However, since ver. 4 released after the expiration of the GIF patent, GIF files have been available as a standard feature.

There were also multiple language versions for the program, including Japanese, English, French, German, Spanish, Hungarian, Italian, Polish, Chinese (simplified and traditional), and Korean, but only the Japanese and English versions have been released since ver. 4.

In addition to the freeware version, there is also a paid version of the software that comes with Wacom and other tablets with additional material data, among others. Paid filters and downloads with support are also available.

==Reception==
A CNET Editors&#x27; Review in January 2011 called Pixia &quot;one of the most capable and professional Photoshop alternatives we&#x27;ve tried.&quot;

<doc id="618850" wikidata="Q630770" url="?curid=618850" title="Joe Sinnott">
<text>Joseph Leonard Sinnott (; October 16, 1926 June 25, 2020) was an American comic book artist. Working primarily as an inker, Sinnott is best known for his long stint on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, from 1965 to 1981 (and briefly in the late 1980s), initially over the pencils of Jack Kirby. During his 60 years as a Marvel freelance artist and then remote worker salaried artist, Sinnott inked virtually every major title, with notable runs on &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, and &quot;Thor&quot;.

In the mid-2000s, Stan Lee cited Sinnott as the company&#x27;s most in-demand inker, saying jocularly, &quot;[P]encilers used to hurl all sorts of dire threats at me if I didn&#x27;t make certain that Joe, and only Joe, inked their pages. I knew I couldn&#x27;t satisfy everyone and I had to save the very most important strips for [him]. To most pencilers, having Joe Sinnott ink their artwork was tantamount to grabbing the brass ring.&quot; Sinnott&#x27;s art appeared on two US Postal Service commemorative stamps in 2007, and he continued to ink &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; Sunday comic strip until his retirement in 2019.

==Early life and career==
Joseph Leonard Sinnott&#x27; was born October 16, 1926, in Saugerties, New York. He was one of seven children to Edward and Catherine McGraw Sinnott; his siblings were Edward and five who predeceased him: Ann / Anne, Frank, John a.k.a. Jack, Leonard and Richard. He grew up in a boarding house that catered primarily to schoolteachers, some of whom inspired in the young Sinnott a love of drawing. His childhood comics influences include the comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; and the comic book characters Batman, Congo Bill, Hawkman and Zatara. Sinnott attended the schools St. Mary of the Snow and Saugerties High School.

Following the death in action of his brother Jack, a member of the United States Army&#x27;s Third Division, in 1944, Sinnott acceded to his mother&#x27;s wishes not to be drafted into the Army himself, and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy in the autumn of that year. After serving with the Seabees in Okinawa during World War II, driving a munitions truck, he was discharged in May 1946 and awarded the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal, and the Navy Occupation Service Medal. After working three years in his father&#x27;s cement-manufacturing plant, he was accepted into the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later the School of Visual Arts) in New York City in March 1949, attending on the GI Bill.

Sinnott&#x27;s first solo professional art job was the backup feature &quot;Trudi&quot; in the St. John Publications humor comic &quot;Mopsy&quot; #12 (Sept. 1950).

Cartoonists and Illustrators School instructor Tom Gill asked Sinnott to be his assistant on Gill&#x27;s freelance comics work. With classmate Norman Steinberg, Sinnott spent nine months drawing backgrounds and incidentals on, initially, Gill&#x27;s Western-movie tie-in comics for Dell Comics. Sinnott recalled in 1992 &quot;taking the Long Island Rail Road every weekend and working all day Saturday and Sunday.&quot; He said in 2003, &quot;Tom was paying us very well. I was still attending school and worked for Tom at nights and [on] weekends,&quot; with night work added after he tired of commuting to Long Island and &quot;began working [in] my room on 75th Street for $7 a week.&quot;

Sinnott in 1992 recalled his earliest work for Gill being the Western comic &quot;Red Warrior&quot; and later including &quot;Kent Blake of the Secret Service&quot;, both for Atlas Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. &quot;Tom would do all of the heads. We&#x27;d do everything else. We&#x27;d do the backgrounds and the figures, but since they were Tom&#x27;s accounts, he&#x27;d do the heads so it looked like his work. I did this for about nine months. It was great learning,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;I can never have enough good to say about Tom Gill. He gave me my start.&quot;

===Timely/Atlas===
Branching out professionally, Sinnott in 1951 met with editor Stan Lee at Marvel Comics&#x27; 1950s forerunner Atlas Comics, having reasoned, he recalled, &quot;&#x27;Gee, Stan can&#x27;t turn me down because he&#x27;s accepting all the work we bring in&#x27;. So I went over to see Stan and he gave me a script right away...&quot; Due to creator credits not generally being given at the time, sources differ on Sinnott&#x27;s first non-Gill Atlas assignment. One standard source gives two stories published the same month: the four-page Western filler &quot;The Man Who Wouldn&#x27;t Die&quot; in &quot;Apache Kid&quot; #8 (Sept. 1951), and the two-page &quot;Under the Red Flag&quot; in &quot;Kent Blake of the Secret Service&quot; #3 (Sept. 1951).

Regardless, Sinnott would go on to draw a multitude of stories in many genres for the company throughout the decade: horror, science-fiction and supernatural-fantasy stories for &quot;Adventures into Terror&quot;, &quot;Astonishing&quot;, &quot;Marvel Tales&quot;, &quot;Menace&quot;, &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot;, &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, &quot;Uncanny Tales&quot; and others; war-comics stories for &quot;Battle&quot;, &quot;Battle Action&quot;, &quot;Battlefield&quot;, &quot;Battlefront&quot;, &quot;Combat&quot;, &quot;Navy Combat&quot; and others, including historical war stories in &quot;Man Comics&quot;; biblical stories in &quot;Bible Tales for Young Folk&quot;; Westerns in &quot;Frontier Western&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke Western&quot;, &quot;Two Gun Western&quot;, &quot;Western Outlaws&quot;, &quot;Wild Western&quot; and others, co-creating with unknown writers the titular heroes of &quot;The Kid from Texas&quot; and &quot;Arrowhead&quot;, the latter starring a Native American warrior; and the occasional crime story (&quot;Caught&quot; ) and romance tale (&quot;Secret Story Romances&quot;).

He said in 2003, &quot;I used to go up [to the office, at the Empire State Building] and sit in a little reading room with four or five other artists. It got so that every week I went up, the same guys would be in the room. Bob Powell, Gene Colan, people like that. I got to talking to them. Syd Shores was [freelancing] there, too.&quot; The pattern, Sinnott recalled, was for assistant art director Bob Brown to call each in turn to meet with Lee for &quot;maybe ten or fifteen minutes... There&#x27;d be a stack of scripts on the left side of his desk, typed on legal yellow paper. He&#x27;d take one off the top and didn&#x27;t know what he&#x27;d be handing you. It could be a war story or a Western or anything. You took it home and were expected to do a professional job on it&quot;.

Sinnott lived in New York City for three years while attending art school, living near Broadway and West 74th Street on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side, and then returned to his hometown of Saugerties, New York, where he spent his life.

During a 1957 economic retrenchment when Atlas let go of most of its staff and freelancers, Sinnott found other work in the six months before the company called him back. Like other freelancers there, he had taken sporadic cuts in his page-rate even before the company implosion. &quot;I was up to $46 a page for pencils and inks. and that was a good rate in 1956, when the decline started. I was down to $21 a page when Atlas stopped hiring me. ... Stan called me and said, &#x27;Joe, Martin Goodman told me to suspend operations because I have all this artwork in-house and have to use it up before I can hire you again.&#x27; It turned out to be six months, in my case. He may have called back some of the other artists later, but that&#x27;s what happened with me&quot;.

He began doing such commercial art as billboards and record covers, ghosting for some DC Comics artists, and a job for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; comics. Former EC Comics artist Jack Kamen by this time was the art director of Harwyn Publishing&#x27;s 12-volume, 1958 &quot;Harwyn Picture Encyclopedia&quot; for children, and had Sinnott join a roster of contributors that included such notable EC artists as Reed Crandall, Bill Elder, George Evans, Angelo Torres and Wally Wood. Sinnott also began a long association with publisher George Pflaum&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Chest&quot;, a Catholic-oriented comic book distributed in parochial schools. With Bob Wischmeyer, a &quot;Treasure Chest&quot; writer-editor, Sinnott collaborated on an unsold college-athlete comic strip &quot;Johnny Hawk, All American&quot;.

During the late 1950s and 1960s period historians and collectors call the Silver Age of Comic Books, Sinnott continued doing occasional pencil-and-ink stories for Atlas Comics as it transitioned into the nascent Marvel Comics, contributing to such &quot;pre-superhero Marvel&quot; titles as &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, &quot;Strange Worlds&quot;, &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; and &quot;World of Fantasy&quot;. He also began a stint with the low-budget Charlton Comics, teamed as penciler with inker Vince Colletta on several romance-comics stories in series including &quot;First Kiss&quot;, &quot;Just Married&quot;, &quot;Romantic Secrets&quot;, &quot;Sweethearts&quot; and &quot;Teen-Age Love&quot; that he would do through 1963.

Sinnott&#x27;s first collaboration with Jack Kirby, one of comics&#x27; most historically groundbreaking and influential creators and the penciler with whom he is most often identified, came with the war-comics story &quot;Doom Under the Deep&quot; in Atlas&#x27; &quot;Battle&quot; #69 (April 1960). After a supernatural Kirby story in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot;, #58 (May 1960), he inked Kirby&#x27;s twice-reprinted giant-monster story &quot;I Was Trapped By Titano the Monster That Time Forgot&quot; in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #10 (July 1960), although not the cover featuring that lead story. Sinnott in 1992 believed his first Kirby collaboration was a Western story titled &quot;Outlaw Man from Fargo&quot;, but nothing approximating that appears in standard databases.

Sinnott did one additional Kirby pre-superhero Marvel story, &quot;I Was a Decoy for Pildorr: The Plunderer from Outer Space&quot;, in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #94 (March 1962), before inking his first Marvel superhero comic: both the cover and the interior of penciler Kirby&#x27;s &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; #5 (July 1962), the issue introducing the long-running supervillain Dr. Doom. Sinnott also inked a few panels of the following issue&#x27;s second page, the remainder inked by another Kirby regular, Dick Ayers.

Sinnott explained his not remaining on &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot; after his single early issue:

Sinnott had by then inked the introduction of the Norse god superhero Thor, in &quot;Journey into Mystery&quot; #83 (Aug. 1962). He also inked the following issue&#x27;s Kirby cover, and, following his papal project, he both penciled and inked five subsequent Thor stories, in issues #91–92, 94–96 (April–Sept. 1963).

Aside from these sporadic works, however, Sinnott was primarily inking for Charlton during this period, with occasional jobs for American Comics Group, &quot;Treasure Chest&quot;, and Dell Comics, for which he variously penciled and fully drew film and TV adaptations, and penciled the one-shot biographical comic &quot;The Beatles&quot; #1 (Nov. 1964). But then, in 1965, he returned to Marvel to work virtually exclusively, beginning with his inking the cover and the story, &quot;Where Walks the Juggernaut&quot;, of &quot;The X-Men&quot; #13 (Sept. 1965).

After this, Sinnott began his long and celebrated stint on a Marvel flagship title, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;, inking Kirby on &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Name Is Gorgon! or What a Way to Spend a Honeymoon!&quot; in issue #44 (Nov. 1965). He remained on the series through Kirby&#x27;s departure after issue #102 (Sept. 1970)—having contributed visually to the introductions of Lee/Kirby&#x27;s Galactus, the Silver Surfer, the Black Panther, the Inhumans, Adam Warlock and other characters—and continued on through 1981, missing an issue here and there or simply inking the cover. He made a brief return in the late 1980s. His post-Kirby pencilers included John Romita, John Buscema, Bill Sienkiewicz, Rich Buckler, and George Pérez.

A comics historian assessed the mid-1960s Kirby–Sinnott art collaboration:

During the 1960s Silver Age, Sinnott also inked several Kirby Captain America stories and his &quot;The Inhumans&quot; backup feature in &quot;Thor&quot;; two Jim Steranko stories each of superspy Nick Fury and superhero Captain America; and Buscema&#x27;s 38-page origin story in &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; #1 (Aug. 1968), among other Marvel work.

Sinnott recalled in 2006,

==Later career==

During his years as a Marvel freelancer, and then salaried artist working from home, Sinnott inked virtually every major title, with notable runs on &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot; and &quot;Thor&quot;.

Sinnott retired from comic books in 1992 to concentrate on inking &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; Sunday strip, and to do recreations of comics covers and commissioned artwork. He continued to contribute sporadically to Marvel, and for &quot;Captain America&quot; vol. 6, #1 (cover-dated Sept. 2011), he inked John Romita Sr. on one of six variant covers done for this premiere issue.

Sinnott retired from the &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; strip in March 2019, at age 92.

==Personal life==
In August 1950, during a two-week school vacation from the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (later the School of Visual Arts) in New York City, Sinnott wed Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Kirlauski (March 7, 1932 – November 1, 2006), to whom he remained married for 56 years until her death. The couple had four children: sons Joseph Jr. and Mark, and daughters Kathleen and Linda, the last of whom predeceased Sinnott.

He died on June 25, 2020, age 93. His grandson Dorian specified, &quot;He passed away this morning, June 25th, at 8:40 am at the age of 93. He enjoyed life and was drawing up until the end.&quot;

<text>Freak the Mighty is a young adult novel by Rodman Philbrick. Published in 1993, it was followed by the novel &quot;Max the Mighty&quot; in 1998. The primary characters are friends Maxwell Kane, a large, developmentally disabled, but kind-hearted boy, and Kevin Avery, nicknamed &quot;Freak&quot;, who is physically disabled but very intelligent. Kevin is diagnosed with Morquio syndrome.

The novel was adapted for the screen under the title &quot;The Mighty&quot; by Charles Leavitt; the film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and Cincinnati, Ohio, and directed by Peter Chelsom, and released in 1998.

==Plot==
In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Maxwell Kane is a young boy with low self-esteem. He lives with his grandparents, Grim and Gram. People are afraid of Max because he looks like his father, Kenneth &quot;Killer&quot; Kane, a convicted murderer. Max reminisces about his time in daycare, when he met a boy named Kevin (or Freak, as their classmates called him). Kevin has Morquio syndrome, wears leg braces and uses crutches, thinks of himself as a robot, and is bullied by bigger kids due to his short height. However, Max likes Kevin and thinks that the crutches and leg braces are neat.

Years later, when Max is in middle school, he learns that Freak and his mother, Gwen, referred to as &quot;The Fair Guinevere&quot;, are moving into the house next door. Max eventually approaches Freak, who acts with hostility. Max later saves Kevin&#x27;s toy ornithopter from a tree and they start to form a friendship. On the Fourth of July, they go to see the fireworks show and are attacked by an older boy, Tony &quot;Blade&quot; D., and his gang. After the show, Blade chases the two with his gang after Freak calls him a cretin. Despite Max&#x27;s lack of knowledge and disability, he escapes by acting on Freak&#x27;s orders, but the two are driven into a muddy millpond, Freak riding on Max&#x27;s shoulders. Freak gets the attention of a nearby police car, which drives off Blade&#x27;s gang and takes the boys home. After this, Kevin starts riding on Max&#x27;s shoulders regularly. They begin to call themselves &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot;. They go on adventures such as going to the hospital which Freak claims has a secret &quot;Bionics Department&quot; which has had his brain CT scanned and fitted into a bionic body.

On one adventure they find a woman&#x27;s purse in the storm drain. They return it to the woman who is named Loretta Lee. She is the wife of Iggy, leader of the Panheads, a motorcycle gang who &quot;struck fear in everyone, even the cops&quot;. Iggy says that the two of them once knew Max&#x27;s father. They consider &quot;having some fun&quot; with the boys but do not because they are afraid that Max&#x27;s father will get parole even though he is serving a life sentence. Loretta also calls Kevin&#x27;s father a magician, saying that he vanished as soon as he found out his son had a birth defect.

At school, Freak chokes on food and is taken to the hospital. Later, Grim reveals to Max that his father, Kenny Kane, has been released from prison on parole. Max&#x27;s father killed his mother, Annie, by strangling her to death. Grim and Gram dislike Kane and are afraid of Max ending up like him. Grim threatens to buy a gun for the family&#x27;s protection. Max is shocked and scared by the news of Kane&#x27;s parole. On Christmas Eve, Max is woken up by Kane, who wants to train him to be his assistant and kidnaps by him. They go to Iggy Lee&#x27;s apartment in the New Tenements, nicknamed the &quot;New Testaments&quot; by the people in Portmouth.

Kane keeps Max tied up on a small chair. Kane swears that he did not murder Annie and calls himself &quot;a man of God&quot;. On Christmas morning he leaves Max alone and Loretta tries to help him escape. Kane catches Loretta and starts to choke her to death but is interrupted by Max escaping the ropes to save her. Max reveals that he witnessed his father kill Annie in the same fashion. Kane tries to grab Max&#x27;s neck and strangle him. Freak then arrives and saves Max by squirting Kane with a squirt gun in the eye which he claims is filled with sulfuric acid, though it is in fact filled with soap, vinegar, and curry powder. The police await outside, and Kane is taken back to prison and, having pled guilty in court, has to serve out the rest of his original sentence plus ten more years.

After having a seizure on his thirteenth birthday, Freak is admitted into the hospital and gives Max a blank book, telling him to write the story of Freak the Mighty in it. Max returns to the hospital the next day to find that Freak died because his heart became too big for his body. Dr. Spivak, Kevin&#x27;s doctor, reveals that Freak knew he was going to have a short life, but he told Max that he was going to get a bionic body because it would give himself hope. The Fair Gwen moves away, with a new man named Rick she is in love with, and Max misses Freak&#x27;s funeral, staying in his room (which he calls the &quot;down under&quot;) for months. Not even Grim or Gram can get him out, until Grim orders Max to return to school. One day, Max sees Loretta, who says that &quot;Doing nothing&#x27;s a drag, kid&quot;, so Max writes all of the adventures he and Freak had, in honor of his best friend.

==Characters==
*Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Kane is the main protagonist and narrator of the story. He is described to be very big and have a striking resemblance to his father, Kenneth &quot;Killer&quot; Kane. In daycare, Max earned the nickname &quot;Kicker&quot; because he had a thing of booting and kicking anyone who dared to touch him, when he was a child. Max lives with his grandparents, Grim and Gram, and usually stays in &quot;the down under&quot;, a small room in the basement. He hates his father, whom he witnessed killing his mother, Annie. He becomes best friends with Freak, who customarily rides on his shoulders and acts as Max&#x27;s surrogate &quot;brain&quot; while Max acts as Freak&#x27;s legs. Max becomes depressed after Freak dies, locking himself in the down under for days until Grim told him to go back to school. He is also very insecure about himself. He usually calls himself a &quot;butthead&quot;, has low self-esteem, and is never confident. Max has dyslexia and is unable to read or write until Freak came along.
* Kevin &quot;Freak&quot; Avery is a disabled, blonde-haired boy whom Max becomes best friends with. Kevin has Morquio syndrome, where the outside of his body cannot grow. He walks on crutches and wears a leg brace. He is a genius for his age and size and is cuttingly sarcastic. He carries a dictionary with him. He is interested in robotics and the tales of King Arthur, to the extent of calling his mother Gwen &quot;The Fair Gwen Of Air/Guinevere&quot; and calling his adventures with Max &quot;quests&quot;. Kevin looks forward to his surgery (which Max later finds out was a lie so he wouldn&#x27;t know the truth), in which he will gain a robot&#x27;s body. Unexpectedly on his 13th birthday, Kevin has a seizure. In the hospital, he dies, because as his doctor puts it, &quot;his heart became too big for his body.&quot; In the film, Kevin&#x27;s last name was changed from Avery to Dillon.
*Grim is Maxwell&#x27;s grandfather. His behavior is at first described as quite grim - thus explaining why Maxwell gave him the nickname - though he shows himself to be a kind and friendly person. However, he is extremely hostile towards Max&#x27;s father due to the murder of his daughter, Annie. In the book, after Grim hears about Killer Kane&#x27;s parole, he threatens to shoot Killer Kane with a gun if he sets foot in the house. At first, Grim feels sorry for Kevin, but later, he appreciates Kevin&#x27;s abilities and intelligence.
*Gram is Maxwell&#x27;s grandmother. Like her husband, she also dislikes Kenneth and misses her daughter, Annie. Gram is quite kind and polite, careful not to hurt anyone&#x27;s feelings. She protests against shooting Kenneth once Grim announces that he will do so.
*Gwen &quot;Fair Gwen&quot; Avery is Kevin&#x27;s mother. Kevin nicknames her &quot;Fair Gwen&quot; after King Arthur&#x27;s beautiful wife, Fair Guinevere. She and Maxwell&#x27;s mother were friends until Kenneth Kane came along and killed her. After her son&#x27;s death, Gwen moves to California and starts a relationship with a man named Rick.
*Kenneth &quot;Kenny&quot; David Kane (also known as Killer Kane) is the main antagonist of the book. He is Max&#x27;s selfish and sociopathic father. He was sent to prison for strangling his wife to death. After his release from prison on parole, Kenny kidnaps Maxwell on Christmas Eve and takes him to Loretta and Iggy&#x27;s apartment. Loretta Lee tries to save Max but ends up getting strangled by Kenneth, though she survives. Eventually, Kevin rescues Max by spraying a mixture of soap, vinegar and curry powder in Kenny&#x27;s eyes, which he claimed was sulfuric acid. In the end, Kenny is jailed and has to serve out the rest of his original sentence plus ten years. In the film, he is sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole.
*Loretta Lee is a thin, red-haired lady whose stolen purse is recovered by Freak and Max. She is married to the leader of a motorcycle gang named The Panheads, Iggy. Loretta is an alcoholic and a smoker and lives in the &quot;poor&quot; part of the town, the New Tenements. When she attempts to help Max escape, she is almost strangled to death by Kenny Kane, who cracks a bone in her neck, but she turned out okay.
*Iggy Lee is an alcoholic, like Loretta, and lives with her in the Tenements. He is the boss of The Panheads, a motorcycle gang. It is suggested that he may have vertigo, as he states it makes him nervous looking up. He was also a friend of Maxwell&#x27;s dad (Killer Kane), who makes him scared and nervous. He attempts to help rescue Max when he was kidnapped by his father. He is the husband of Loretta Lee.
*Dr. Spivak is Kevin&#x27;s doctor. She tells Max about Kevin&#x27;s death and that the real cause of his death was his heart growing too big for his body.
*Annie Kane is Maxwell&#x27;s mother but does not appear in the book. She was brutally murdered by her husband, Kenneth Kane.
*Tony D. is a juvenile delinquent who first encountered Max and Freak during the Fourth of July drunkenly asking them for M-80 fireworks. He along with his gang tried to harm Max and Freak with a knife. His gang steals Loretta Lee&#x27;s purse. He later tells Max he&#x27;s sorry about Kevin (Freak), who died after having a seizure, though Max doesn&#x27;t like it and wants to be enemies with him. He is also known as &quot;Blade&quot;.
*Rick is a minor character who does not appear in this book. After Kevin Avery dies, he starts a relationship with Gwen Avery in California.
*Mr. Meehan is Maxwell&#x27;s reading skills tutor.
*Mrs. Donelli is Maxwell&#x27;s new English teacher.
*Mrs. Addison is the school&#x27;s principal.

<text>The Amsterdam Metro () is a rapid transit system serving Amsterdam, Netherlands, and extending to the surrounding municipalities of Diemen and Ouder-Amstel. Until 2019, it also served the municipality of Amstelveen, but this route was closed and converted into a tram line. The network is owned by the City of Amsterdam and operated by municipal public transport company Gemeente Vervoerbedrijf (GVB), which also operates trams, free ferries and local buses.

The metro system consists of five routes and serves 39 stations, with a total length of . Three routes start at Amsterdam Centraal: Route 53 and Route 54 connect the city centre with the suburban residential towns of Diemen, Duivendrecht and Amsterdam-Zuidoost (the city&#x27;s southeastern borough), while Route 51 first runs south and then follows a circular route connecting the southern and western boroughs. Route 50 connects Zuidoost to the Amsterdam-West borough using a circular line, which it shares with Route 51. It is the only route that does not cross the city centre. A fifth route, Route 52, running from the Amsterdam-Noord (&quot;north&quot;) borough to Amsterdam-Zuid (&quot;south&quot;) via Amsterdam Centraal, came into operation on 21 July 2018. As opposed to the other routes, it runs mostly through bored tunnels and does not share tracks with any other route.

==History==

===Planning history===

The first plans for an underground railway in Amsterdam date from the 1920s: in November 1922, members of the municipal council of Amsterdam Zeeger Gulden and Emanuel Boekman asked the responsible alderman Ter Haar to study the possibility of constructing an underground railway in the city, in response to which the municipal department of Public Works drafted reports with proposals for underground railways in both 1923 and 1929. These plans stalled in the planning phase, however, and it took until the 1950s for the discussion about underground rail to resurface again in Amsterdam.

The post-war population boom and increase in motorized traffic shifted the perception of underground rail transport in Amsterdam considerably: whereas in the 1920s, underground rail had been considered too expensive, halfway through the 1950s it was presented as a realistic solution to the problems caused by increased traffic. In 1955, a report published by the municipal government concerning the inner city of Amsterdam—known by the Dutch title &quot;Nota Binnenstad&quot;—suggested installing a commission to explore solutions to the traffic problems Amsterdam faced. This commission, which was headed by former director of the department of Public Works J.W. Clerx, was subsequently installed in March 1956, and published its report &quot;Openbaar vervoer in de agglomeratie Amsterdam&quot; in 1960.

The aldermen and mayor of Amsterdam agreed with the conclusion of the report of the Clerx commission that an underground railway network ought to be built in Amsterdam in the near future. In April 1963 they installed the &quot;Bureau Stadsspoorweg&quot; which had the task to study the technical feasibility of a metropolitan railway, to propose a route network, to suggest the preferred order of construction of the various lines, and to study the adverse effects of constructing a metro line, such as traffic disruption and the demolition of buildings.

In 1964 and 1965, &quot;Bureau Stadsspoorweg&quot; presented four reports to the municipal government of Amsterdam, which were made available to the public on 30 August 1966. In March 1968, the aldermen and mayor of Amsterdam subsequently submitted a proposal to the municipal council of Amsterdam to agree to the construction of the metro network, which the council assented to on 16 May 1968 with 38 votes in favour and 3 against. Under the original plan, four lines were to be built, connecting the entire city and replacing many of the existing tram lines. The following lines were planned: an east–west line from the southeast to the Osdorp district via Amsterdam Centraal railway station; a circle line from the western harbor area to the suburban town of Diemen; a north–south line from the northern district via Amsterdam Centraal to Weteringplantsoen traffic circle, with two branches at both ends; and a second east–west line from Geuzenveld district to Gaasperplas. The system would be constructed gradually and was expected to be completed by the end of the 1990s.

===Design and construction===

The first part of the original plan to be carried out was the construction of the &quot;Oostlijn&quot; (East Line), which started in 1970. The East Line links the city centre with the large-scale Bijlmermeer residential developments in the south-east of the city. It opened in 1977. The East Line starts underground, crossing the city centre and adjacent neighbourhoods in the eastern districts until Amsterdam Amstel railway station, where it continues above ground in southeastern direction. At Van der Madeweg metro station, the line splits into two branches: the Gein Branch for Route 54 and Gaasperplas Branch for Route 53. Since 1980, the northern terminus for both routes is Amsterdam Centraal railway station.

Ben Spangberg, an architect from the Government of Amsterdam, was asked to design the stations on the line. After two years of work, he told that it was too much for one person, and was assigned to the project as well. Spangberg said that they avoided sharp corners and used smooth designs instead. He wanted to have elevators in all stations, but initially wasn&#x27;t allowed due to cost issues and because Nederlandse Spoorwegen didn&#x27;t want to stay behind. After further discussions, the architects were permitted to design two elevator shafts, with only one of them active. Construction on the tunnels started while the stations were still being designed. The architects frequently visited the construction sites to instruct the workers to do something specific to allow for possible changes in the future. Most underground areas of the line were built by using long caissons. The caissons were built on the spot and lowered into their place by blasting away the soil beneath. This method required the demolition the houses above the tunnel. The Wibautstraat station and the tunnels near it were constructed differently, using the cut-and-cover method.

During the construction of the metro tunnel, the decision to demolish the Nieuwmarkt neighbourhood in the city centre led to strong protests in the spring of 1975 from action groups consisting of locals and members of the highly active Amsterdam squatting movement. Wall decorations at the Nieuwmarkt metro station are a reference to the protests, which are known as the Nieuwmarkt riots (&quot;Nieuwmarktrellen&quot;). Despite the protests, construction of the metro line continued but plans to build a highway through the area were abandoned. In addition, the original plans for an east–west metro line were cancelled. One of the sites where this line was to connect with the East Line had already been built underneath Weesperplein station. This lower level of Weesperplein station was never opened to the public, but its existence can still be noticed by the elevator buttons. Since the East Line was planned and built during the Cold War, Weesperplein station also features a bomb shelter which has never been used as such.

===Later lines===

In 1990, the &quot;Amstelveenlijn&quot; (Amstelveen Line) was opened, which is used for Route 51. Under a political compromise between the city of Amsterdam and the municipality of Amstelveen, the northern section of the line was built as a metro line while the southern section is an extended tram line. Therefore, Route 51 was originally referred to as a &#x27;sneltram&#x27; (express tram) service, and the vehicles were manufactured to light rail standards. The changeover between third rail and overhead tramline power took place at Zuid Station.

From March 2019 onwards, the Amstelveenlijn as a &quot;sneltram&quot; ceased to exist, and is being replaced by a tram line terminating at Zuid station, including a €300 million rebuild of the original line. For connection to the metro, passengers will have to transfer at Zuid station. Line number 51 was retained for a new circular line between Isolatorweg and Central Station.

In 1997, the &quot;Ringlijn&quot; (Ring Line), which is used for Route 50, was added to the system. The line provides a rapid transit connection between the south and the west of the city, eliminating the necessity of crossing the city centre.

In 2018, the &quot;Noord-Zuidlijn&quot; (North–South Line) was added to the network. The line provides a fast connection from the north of the IJ waterway to the south of Amsterdam.

==Network==
From 1997 to 2018 the Amsterdam metro system consisted of four metro routes. The oldest routes are Route 54 (from Centraal station to Gein) and Route 53 (from Centraal station to Gaasperplas). Both routes are using the &quot;Oostlijn&quot; (East Line) infrastructure, which was completed in 1977. Route 51 (from Centraal station to Amstelveen Westwijk), using part of the East Line as well as the &quot;Amstelveenlijn&quot; (Amstelveen Line), was added in 1990. Route 50 (from Isolatorweg to Gein) using the &quot;Ringlijn&quot; (Ring Line or Circle Line), which was completed in 1997, as well as part of the East Line infrastructure.

A fifth line, Route 52 (from Noord station to Zuid station), was added to the network operating the &quot;Noord-Zuidlijn&quot; (North–South Line), which was completed and opened on 21 July 2018.

There are 33 full metro stations, Since Route 52 on the new North-South Line opened, six additional stations and of route have been added to the metro system, yielding a new combined network length of . In 2019, sneltram Route 51 no longer operates into the metro network. The southern sneltram portion was closed for conversion to be incorporated into the tram network.

===East Line (Routes 53 and 54)===

====Route====

On 14 October 1977, the first metro train ran on the &quot;Oostlijn&quot; (East Line) from Weesperplein to Amsterdam-Zuidoost, with two branches respectively going to Gaasperplas (now Route 53) and Holendrecht (now Route 54). Spaklerweg station was completed as a shell, but opened later. On 11 October 1980, both routes were extended to Amsterdam Centraal Station, which is now their northern terminus. The Gein Branch was extended in the southern direction on 27 August 1982, when the section between Holendrecht and Gein was completed. Spaklerweg station was then opened. In some plans for the Gein Branch, an extension to Weesp and Almere was being considered. According to the most recent regional planning study, that now seems unlikely.

====Architecture====
A notable part of the East Line infrastructure is a dual metro overpass on the Gaasperplas Branch in the Bijlmermeer district between Ganzenhoef and Kraaiennest stations. This long colonnade contains two single crossovers, each consisting of 33 pillars carrying long beams. The center-to-center distance between the two overpasses is . This exceptional height was necessary because the metro had to bridge the main thoroughfares in the Bijlmermeer district which were built on a system of raised embankments and viaducts.
The stations, the infrastructure and the Diemen-Zuid maintenance facility of the East Line were designed by Ben Spängberg and Sier van Rhijn, two architects at the former Public Works Department of the City of Amsterdam. Their designs in Brutalist style are characterized by large-scale application of bare concrete and excessive space in the underground station halls. It also included a sophisticated use of colour. For example, the red colour of the train doors in the original design was also used at major facilities such as billboards, gates, elevator doors, bins, and the platform signage. For the design of the entire East Line Spängberg and Van Rhijn received Merkelbach Award in 1979. The East Line was also awarded the &quot;Betonprijs&quot; (Concrete Award) in 1981, which is commemorated by the award plaques in the concourses of Centraal station and Gein station.

As part of the city&#x27;s policy that one percent of construction budgets for public works had to be spent on art, all stations on the &quot;Oostlijn&quot; have been decorated by different artists. In addition, the western wall of the tunnel was painted with lines and patterns which altered between the two stations, providing passengers with a fascinating view during the ride. Over the years, these decorations have completely been covered with graffiti. Some of the station artworks have also disappeared. Plans to remove all artworks as part of the large-scale renovation of the East Line tunnel in 2012 were altered after citizens&#x27; protests stating their historical significance.

====Renovation====
Over the years, several stations along the East Line were expanded or renovated. Since 2003, the metro station at Amsterdam Centraal station has been continuously under construction in order to accommodate the new North–South Line station. As part of commercial development of the area surrounding the Amsterdam Arena football stadium, which included a new major business and shopping district, the Bijlmer Arena station was substantially enlarged in order to handle the increasing number of passengers. The new station, designed by Grimshaw and Arcadis Articon Architects, opened in 2007 and was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Another East Line station, Kraaiennest on Route 53, was reconstructed and upgraded in 2013 as part of the major urban renewal efforts in the Bijlmermeer district. The station designed by Maccreanor Lavington features a stainless steel facade with a floral design, which, according to the architects, &quot;allows the station to be a lantern for the local neighbourhood, creating a sense of warmth on street level and creating an instantly recognisable feature for the station&quot; at night time. The design was awarded the 2014 EU Stirling Prize.

A major overhaul of sixteen East Line stations was announced in June 2014. The renovation works taking place from 2015 until 2017 should bring more light and space to the stations. By removing paint layers on the walls, the original Brutalist architecture will become more pronounced. In addition, disused ticket offices are to be removed and lighting and signage will be improved.

Following the Nieuwmarkt Riots in 1975, the next major expansion of the metro network into the bordering city of Amstelveen was politically sensitive. When the decision was made to begin construction of the &quot;Amstelveenlijn&quot; (Amstelveen Line) in 1984, it was originally considered an express tram service rather than a fully-fledged metro route. On 1 December 1990 the section running from Spaklerweg to Poortwachter Station in Amstelveen was completed. As the sensitivity surrounding the metro expansion waned in the 1990s, the route was increasingly being referred to as a metro service. On 13 September 2004 an extension to Amstelveen Westwijk was completed.

Originally, the entire route of the Amstelveen Line from Spaklerweg, where it connects with the East Line, to Amstelveen was to be powered via overhead wiring. Eventually, it was decided to use a third rail between Spaklerweg and Zuid station in order to be able to increase metro service on this section of the line during exhibitions at the RAI convention centre, and overhead wiring on the southern section into Amstelveen.

The line was officially opened on 30 November 1990, replacing the overcrowded bus route 67. The equipment, lightrail series S1 and S2, was built between 1990 and 1994 by Belgian manufacturer BN in Bruges. From 1994, a total of 25 light rail vehicles was in operation. Since the extension to Westwijk in 2004, a number of S3 series trains are sometimes used on this route, raising the total number of vehicles available to 29.

Shortly before the opening, two lightrail vehicles had collided during trial runs, which reduced the number of vehicles available for the route to 11. Because of the lack of equipment and startup problems, the route was initially operated with limited service. In February 1991 heavy snowfall, continuing technical problems and equipment shortages led to the decision to limit the route to the route between Centraal Station and Zuid Station for nearly seven months, with replacement bus services on the remaining route into Amstelveen.

In 2018, after the completion of the &quot;Noord-Zuidlijn&quot; (North–South Line), there would be no more room at Amsterdam Zuid station for Route 51 to continue as express tram service into Amstelveen. According to a long-term regional planning study of 2011, the &quot;Amstelveenlijn&quot; was to be upgraded to a fully-fledged metro service. On 12 March 2013, however, the regional council of the City Region of Amsterdam decided that Route 51 would be replaced by an improved express tram service running from Westwijk to Zuid Station and a separate metro service running from Zuid Station and Amstel Station. Passengers from Amstelveen would then be required to change at Zuid Station to the metro route for Amstel or to the new Route 52 for Centraal Station. It was also decided that Tram Route 5 would run between Amstelveen and Westergasfabriek. Conversion of the southern section of the Amstelveen Line to tram operation started in 2016.

On 3 March 2019, the Amstelveen branch (the hybrid metro/tram line) was cut from route 51 as the tunnel connecting the metro line with the tram network had to make way for an underground section of the A10 motorway. In December 2020, the Amstelveen Line would become tram line 25.

====Route====
From Centraal Station to Amsterdam Zuid station, Route 51 ran as a full metro service and had no at-grade intersections. The light-rail vehicles on the line were powered by a third rail with the line being suitable for wide trams. The BN vehicles, however, had a width of which was the maximum width on the southern section of the line between Zuid Station and Westwijk. In order to bridge the gap between the trains and the platforms in northern section, the vehicles were equipped with retractable footboards at the doors. In addition, the vehicles were equipped with pantographs in order to retrieve power from the overhead wiring on the southern section. From Zuid Station to Westwijk, the route operated as an express tram service. On the northern half of this section, Route 51 shared tracks with Line 5 of the tramway, with dual height platforms provided at the stops shared by both lines.

Since 3 March 2019, the Amstelveen section of route 51 has been discontinued. Line 51 was upgraded to a full metro line and now runs between Central Station and Isolatorweg. Since December 2020, tram line 25 has been serving the route from Zuid Station to Westwijk.

===Ring Line (Route 50)===
Opened on 1 June 1997, the &quot;Ringlijn&quot; (Ring Line or Circle Line) is entirely built on embankments and viaducts, and has no level crossings. The line was initially for political reasons called &quot;express circle tram&quot;, but since the opening of the Ring Line the transit service on the line is referred to as a Metro Route 50 (from Gein to Isolatorweg). Because it was originally considered a tram line, the light rail vehicle width of 2,65 meters was to be applied; the width that was also used on the Amstelveen Line. The new &quot;trams&quot; (Series M4 and S3) have retractable running boards to bridge the space between the vehicle and the platform at existing stations. Since Route 50 proved hugely popular, the express tram vehicles were insufficient to handle the number of passengers. Instead of ordering additional vehicles, in 2000 the city of Amsterdam decided to adjust the platforms at the stations between Amstelveenseweg and Isolatorweg, whereby the older rolling stock (M1, M2 and M3) serving on the East Line could also serve on the Ring Line. Such an operation was already taken into account during the construction of the stations.

===North–South line (Route 52)===
In 2002, the construction of the &quot;Noord/Zuidlijn&quot; (North–South line) was started. The new metro line is the first to serve the Amsterdam North district, via a tunnel under the IJ. From there, it runs via Amsterdam Centraal to Amsterdam Zuid, which is planned to become the second biggest transport hub in the city, after Amsterdam Centraal. The line includes a mixture of bored tunnels and immersed tunnels under the IJ.

The construction programme experienced several difficulties, mainly at Amsterdam Centraal, resulting in the project running more than 40% over budget and the opening being delayed several times. The project initially had a budget of €1.46 billion, but after several setbacks the total cost estimate has been adjusted to €3.1 billion (at 2009 prices). The original planned opening was for 2011, but eventually the line was opened on 21 July 2018.

The North–South line might be extended to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the future. In August 2014, it was announced that the line was to be equipped with 4G mobile phone coverage, to be funded jointly by the major mobile phone operators.

==Planned expansion==
The tram line to IJburg in the east was originally planned to be a metro line. For this reason, a short tunnel was constructed eastwards from Centraal Station underneath the railway lines. As this line was eventually constructed for tram services, the tunnel was abandoned, and there are plans to use it as part of a chocolate museum. There are still plans for the tram to IJburg to be upgraded to metro and connect to the nearby city of Almere. 

On completion of the north–south metro line, Amsterdam Municipality announced it was analysing a possible east–west line at a projected cost of €7 billion.

In January 2019, CEO of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol Dick Benschop announced that agreements had been reached to extend the north–south line to the airport and Hoofddorp. In June 2019, the province of North Holland outlined plans to extend the metro to Zaandam and Purmerend along with Schiphol and Hoofddorp. A station box has already been constructed for a potential underground station in Sixhaven, on the north–south line between Noorderpark and Centraal, to be opened at a later date.

==Technology==

===Rolling stock===
As of January 2016, there are 90 electric multiple unit train sets in use within the Amsterdam Metro system. All use standard gauge track and operate on a 750 V DC third rail electrification system. 

====M1/M2/M3====

The original, first-generation fleet consisted of types M1, M2 and M3, designed as four-axle, two-car sets manufactured by the German firm Linke-Hofmann-Busch and delivered between 1973 and 1980. These first-generation trains are nicknamed &quot;zilvermeeuw&quot; (herring gull) because of their body of unpainted steel creating a silvery look. In 2009, all trains were provided with a new interior design by different artists. As they are built to full metro carrying capacity, they were used mainly on the east line services, Routes 53 and 54, with occasional use on Route 50.

As they neared the end of their life cycle and spare parts no longer became available, the entire fleet of M1-M3 trains was gradually taken out of service permanently from 2012 to 2015, being replaced by the modern M5 trains. The last unit (No. 23) was retired after a farewell tour on 19 December 2015 and has been preserved as a heritage train. All the other units have been scrapped, with the last of these being scrapped in December 2015.

====S1/S2 and S3/M4====
Until the arrival of the new M5 units, the remainder of the fleet consisted of smaller, narrower two section, 6-axle units that could operate both on the main metro network and the light rail (&quot;sneltram&quot;) line to Amstelveen. Types S1 and S2, manufactured by La Brugeoise et Nivelles in Belgium, were the first units to be produced for use on this new line. In service since 1990, they currently operate exclusively on Route 51, although they could technically also be used on other lines though this has never been done. These vehicles are equipped with both third rail shoes and pantographs, along with retractable footboards to bridge the gap between the trains and the platforms on sections built to full metro standards. They are due to be withdrawn by 2020 with the conversion of the Amstelveen line to express tram service.

Types M4 and S3 were built by CAF in Spain to expand the fleet and have been in service since 1997. Type M4 was built for the new Ring Line service to Isolatorweg and is hence only third rail equipped. They mainly operate on Route 50 but can also be found on Routes 53 and 54, but never on route 51 due to their lack of pantographs. Four vehicles of the same design, designated type S3, have been equipped with pantographs to also serve on Route 51, but these rarely appear on other lines. As the platforms on the Ring Line were originally built to a smaller loading gauge than those on Routes 53 and 54, M4 and S3 sets were also equipped with retractable footboards to permit boarding on the section that Route 50 shares with Route 54. When the platforms on the Ring Line were narrowed to accommodate the older but wider M1-M3 sets, the boards were permanently removed on all M4 sets, but not on the S3 sets due to the limited loading gauge of the Amstelveen line.

====M5====
A newer addition to the Amsterdam Metro fleet is the M5 series, manufactured by the Polish manufacturer Alstom Konstal based on its Metropolis family of high-capacity metro trains, variants of which are in use in several foreign metro systems. Delivered from June 2013 onwards, the M5 series departs radically from previous generation units by coming in six-car articulated sets with gangway connections between all cars. Although the trains are suitable for unmanned service, they remain controlled by drivers for the time being. However, the trains are compatible with Alstom&#x27;s &quot;Urbalis&quot; communications-based train control system which will replace the current signalling system by 2017 and enable automatic train operation across the entire network. The M4 sets have been similarly equipped with this system in early 2016.

The initial order of 28 M5 metro sets, each carrying up to 1,000 passengers, was placed to replace all M1-M3 sets on the East Line as well as to increase overall capacity on the generally overstretched metro network. As such, they are used on all routes except Route 51. For Route 52 on the North–South Line an option was taken on a second series of 12 trains which was originally designated M6. However, the GVB now refers to all trains of this type as the M5 series. 

====M7====

The newest addition to the Amsterdam Metro fleet is the M7 series, manufactured by the Spanish manufacturer CAF, which entered passenger service on February 28, 2023. Onwards, the M7 series departs radically from previous generation M5 units by coming in three-car articulated sets with gangway connections between all cars. 

The initial order of 30 M7 metro sets, was placed to replace all S1-S2 in 2024, and S3-M4 in 2027. As such, they are used on line 50, and later on 53 and 54.

====Summary====
===Ticketing system===

The &quot;OV-chipkaart&quot;, a nationwide contactless smart card system, is the only valid form of ticket on the metro system. It replaced the so-called &quot;strippenkaart&quot; system on 27 August 2009, after the two systems had run parallel since 2006. Ticket barriers have been installed in all metro stations, with free-standing card readers where platforms are shared with train or tram lines. Amstelveen Line light rail stations are only equipped with free-standing card readers.

===Graphic design===
Signage on the Amsterdam metro system has featured multiple designs stemming from different eras. The original 1974 signage uses the M.O.L. typeface, which was specially designed for the metro by Gerard Unger. The openings within the letters are larger than normal in order to improve the letters&#x27; legibility when illuminated. The name M.O.L. refers to the Dutch word &quot;mol&quot; which means mole in English. The idea to use a mole as the mascot for the metro was rejected by city authorities. Other versions are the 1991 version found on the Amstelveen Line, the 1995 version found mainly on Ring Line and the 2009 version which has replaced earlier versions at many stations. In 2016 the City Region of Amsterdam commissioned a new signage system and logo in an effort to harmonize all of the signage and wayfinding elements across all metro lines, in time for the renovation of the East Line and opening of the North-South Line. The new design is based on the already-existing R-net branding, though somewhat modified. It uses the Profile typeface and harks back to the original Unger design by using blue, white and red design elements. All of the wayfinding systems commissioned after the original 1974 one are designed by Mijksenaar.
===Communications===
A communications backbone for the Amsterdam Metro was installed by Thales, which is also responsible for associated maintenance.

<doc id="618856" wikidata="Q1855742" url="?curid=618856" title="The Mighty">
<text>The Mighty is a 1998 American coming of age buddy comedy-drama film directed by Peter Chelsom and written by Charles Leavitt. Based on the book &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; by Rodman Philbrick, the film stars Sharon Stone, Gena Rowlands, Gillian Anderson, Harry Dean Stanton, Kieran Culkin, James Gandolfini and Elden Henson.

The film received positive reviews from critics and Stone was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

==Plot==
12-year-old Kevin &quot;Freak&quot; Dillon suffers from Morquio syndrome and lives with his mother Gwen &quot;Fair Gwen&quot; Dillon. Due to his disability, he walks with leg braces and crutches. Meanwhile, Maxwell &quot;Max&quot; Kane is a 14-year-old boy with learning challenges and living with his maternal grandparents Susan &quot;Gram&quot; and Elton &quot;Grim&quot; Pinneman. He has flunked the seventh grade twice and is tormented by Tony &quot;Blade&quot; Fowler, a teenage delinquent who leads the &quot;Doghouse Boys&quot;, a bully gang. When Kevin is assigned as Max&#x27;s reading tutor, they form a bond of friendship over the similar circumstances they share, such as both being outcasts in their school and their fathers abandoning them.

Freak and Max go to a festival to watch a firework show where they get attacked by Blade and his gang. The two then escape into a lake with Freak riding on Max&#x27;s shoulders. Max subsequently starts carrying Freak around on his shoulders during their various adventures, describing it as Freak acting as Max&#x27;s brain while Max acts as Freak&#x27;s feet. This allows Freak to take part in activities such as school athletics that were previously restricted to him, earning Freak acceptance amongst his peers for the first time. During a visit to a museum, Freak uses Sir Galahad&#x27;s sword to knight them as &quot;Freak the Mighty.&quot;

Freak later witnesses Blade&#x27;s gang putting someone&#x27;s purse in a sewer. The two retrieve the purse but are once again confronted by the Doghouse Boys. They attempt to attack Freak, but Max stops them by picking up a manhole cover and throwing it at the gang, forcing them to flee in panic. Max and Freak find that the purse belongs to a woman named Loretta Lee and return it to her. Loretta is married to former gang leader Iggy. The couple are old friends of Max&#x27;s father Kenny &quot;Killer&quot; Kane, who is currently in prison for the strangulation murder of Max&#x27;s mother. At the age of four, Max witnessed this. Loretta calls Max &quot;Mute Boy&quot; because when he was on the witness stand to testify against his father years ago, he couldn&#x27;t speak a word. Max storms out of the apartment in frustration, breaking Loretta&#x27;s chain lock on her door.

On Christmas Eve, Max is kidnapped by Kane who has been released on parole and is taken to Iggy and Loretta&#x27;s apartment, where he is tied up. Loretta attempts to help Max escape but Kane attempts to strangle her. Max&#x27;s seeing the attack prompts a repressed memory of Kane killing his mother; he breaks free of his bonds and attacks Kane.

After tracking Max and Kane, Freak breaks in, armed with a squirt gun he claims is loaded with sulfuric acid which he got for Christmas, which he sprays in Kane&#x27;s eyes. Just before an angered Kane regains himself and attempts to hurt Freak, Max tackles him through the wall where the police are waiting; Kane is then returned to prison for life without the possibility of parole while Freak and Max run home to have Christmas dinner with Gwen, Grim and Gram. While exchanging Christmas gifts, Freak gives Max a blank book and tells him to write in it. That night, Freak dies in his sleep due to heart problems. The next morning, Max hears the news and gives chase to the ambulance on foot. Gwen opens the ambulance doors from the inside and tells Max that Freak&#x27;s heart got too big for his body and that his death was only a matter of time. Max recalls the biogenic intervention unit of a research center Freak had mentioned earlier where he tells Max that he was going to be the first to be transplanted into a new body so that he can live his life normally and to the fullest. Max rushes to the place, barefoot in the snow, only to discover that the lab in question is nothing other than a commercial laundromat. Heartbroken and lied to, Max breaks down in grief among the laundry workers.

The following weeks, Max continues attending school but spends his spare time locked in the basement, even missing Freak&#x27;s funeral and seeing Gwen moving away. He later runs into Loretta at a bus stop, who says that &quot;doing nothing&#x27;s a drag, kid&quot;. He takes this advice to heart and even works up the courage to answer a question from his teacher during a lecture. Inspired by their bond, Max decides to write all the adventures he had with Freak in the blank book. Max gets writer&#x27;s block on the last page and puts an illustration of King Arthur&#x27;s grave which reads &quot;Here Lies King Arthur, Once and Future King&quot;, to symbolize his belief that he will see Freak again. Max then takes Freak&#x27;s ornithopter and winds it up, making it fly.

<text>Oldbury-on-Severn is a small village near the mouth of the River Severn in the South Gloucestershire district of the county of Gloucestershire in the west of England. The parish, which includes the village of Cowhill had a population at the 2011 census of 780.
It is home to the nearby Oldbury nuclear power station, a Magnox power station which opened in 1967 and ceased operation on 29 February 2012.
The village is the site of an Iron Age fort called Oldbury Camp. Older maps refer to this as a Roman camp and also refer to another Roman camp surrounding St Arilda&#x27;s Church. 

Village attractions include a footpath near the river, a pub known as the &quot;Anchor Inn&quot; plus the village hall and two churches. It is also the home of Thornbury Sailing Club.

The &quot;Anchor Inn&quot; is British heritage listed building. It was originally built as a mill house in the 18th century and rewindowed in the early 19th century.

The parish church is dedicated to St Arilda, a local saint and martyr whose origins may lie in the fourth or fifth century. The church is on a small hill (35m asl at ST609919) and is an excellent viewpoint, and, for river travellers, waymark.

== Locations and businesses ==
Patchway, where Rolls-Royce is a major aerospace employer, lies just north of Filton Airfield where BAE Systems and Airbus UK are also major aerospace employers. The town comprises three areas until 2015 when Stoke Lodge formed its own Parish council: Patchway Estate, Stoke Lodge and Aztec West.

Housing in Patchway Estate lies southwest of the main London-South Wales railway line. Coniston Road circles the estate, where many of the streets are named after birds and trees. Patchway Trading Estate is adjacent to the dual carriageway linking the A38 and M5. The mall and two retail parks at Cribbs Causeway, just north of Filton airfield, form the largest shopping centre in South West England.

On the opposite side of the railway track, (since 2015 no longer part of Patchway) is the Stoke Lodge housing estate. Now called Stoke Lodge and the Common Parish Council, The A38 trunk road, upgraded to a dual carriageway in the mid-1970s, separates the two housing estates.

Aztec West, an office and warehouse park, is situated on the northern fringes of the town, sandwiched between Patchway Estate and Stoke Lodge. The CEGB Pension Fund started the park in the early 1980s and it is now owned by Arlington. New phases of this development are being built.

A major four-level motorway interchange (M4/M5) is close to Aztec West. Called the Almondsbury Interchange, it was completed in the early 1970s.

Patchway Greenway is a semi-rural footpath which leads from Patchway Common eastwards to Bradley Stoke. On the north-west fringe of Patchway Estate, a footbridge (known locally as the Banana Bridge) passes over the M5 motorway, and leads to a footpath that passes down over the steep Severn Escarpment into the village of Over.

Patchway railway station is on the mainline South Wales-London railway line, but the service to Bristol is infrequent with just a single train per hour which is frequently shortformed (meaning it should have three carriages but arrives with only two so that prospective passengers are unable to board) during rush hour.

==Recent history==
At the start of the 20th century, Patchway was a small village centred on Patchway Green, now known as Patchway Common. Part of the village straddled Gloucester Road, south of the bridge which passed over the Great Western Railway line from Bristol to South Wales. Patchway Tunnel was nearby.

Industrialization started when a flying school at Filton Aerodrome was converted into an aeroengine factory, when the Bristol Aeroplane Company (BAC) acquired Cosmos Engineering in 1920.

During the 1930s, new housing was built on Patchway Estate, just north of Filton Aerodrome, and bungalows were built on Stoke Lane.

BAC started the development of East Works on Gypsy Patch Lane during the re-armament programme of the 1930s. Engine component testing facilities were built alongside the main railway line during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

A dual carriageway, known as the Filton Bypass, was constructed through Patchway Estate in the late 1930s, to divert A38 road traffic away from Filton. During World War II, the US Army had a tented encampment along the wide verges of the bypass. In the late 1940s the bypass was severed by the extension of the main runway at Filton aerodrome to accommodate the Bristol Brabazon airliner. This project also required the demolition of the nearby hamlet of Charlton, many of whose residents were rehoused on Patchway Estate.

In the 1950s and early 1960s a large bungalow estate was built at Stoke Lodge, adjacent to Patchway Common. A huge overspill estate was built at the back of Patchway Estate in the mid-1960s.

Also in the mid-1960s, the New Filton Bypass (now part of the M5 motorway) was constructed, on the north-west fringe of Patchway Estate, along the upper edge of the Severn Escarpment. This road forms the boundary between the town of Patchway and the adjacent Green Belt.

Rolls-Royce have built new production facilities on the Gypsy Patch test site, close to the A38 and have completely demolished the old East Works, for redevelopment. All the Rolls-Royce Bristol facilities are now north of Gypsy Patch Lane, the former West Works site on the airfield having been redeveloped by the Post Office in the late 1980s.

== Modern Patchway ==

Patchway is one of the 44 Parish and Town Councils in South Gloucestershire. Amenities include a fire station, library, doctor&#x27;s clinic and schools. There is a Day Centre for the elderly and a children&#x27;s play area. Sports facilities include cricket and football pitches and a sports hall.

The Britannia public house was demolished in March 2010.

During mid-2010 the then library premises were vacated with a small library being set up in the nearby Casson Centre. The old library premises were demolished and this site was incorporated with that of the former Britannia public house to facilitate the building of a new three storey construction on behalf of the local NHS Trust – The Hub. The building includes various social health and well-being amenities for use by all ages, besides a new library. The majority of the structure for the first two storeys had taken shape by Christmas 2010. By Autumn 2011 the structure of the building was complete and the building was being fitted out. External groundwork and paving was mostly complete by now as well. The Hub was opened on Monday 5 September 2011 and has since become a focal point of the locality. Due to its height, rising to three storeys, and position on the gently rising slope of Rodway Road, the Hub building can be seen rising above the surrounding buildings, particularly when approaching the area from the north side, over the railway bridge.

Patchway has had a long connection with the Scout Movement, with the Headquarters being located in buildings of Worthing Road – behind the Town Council offices. In June 2011 the Scout Movement are celebrating their 70th anniversary and will be holding special events to commemorate this.

At the end of August 2011, work began to revise the road layout on Highwood Lane, which will see all through traffic eliminated, the road being closed to normal traffic between Coniston Road and Durban Road, apart from access to the local centre at the Durban Road end. The south side of the then current dual-carriageway becoming part of the internal roadway network for the Charlton Hayes development and the north side being restricted to buses only.

On 1 April 2015 the Stoke Lodge part of Patchway, which is located to the north of the railway line, on the eastern side of the A38, became part of the new parish of Stoke Lodge and The Common.

==Charlton Hayes==

Charlton Hayes is a new extension to Patchway to the south, named after the demolished village of Charlton. Construction started in late 2009 and includes a new bypass road from the A38 to the bottom of the Cribbs Causeway Mall. Approximately 6000 new homes will be in the final development.

The new link road – Hayes Way − opened just before Christmas 2010, just in time to assist in relieving Highwood Lane of some of the serious road traffic pressure which have previously been experienced on Highwood Lane. The road provides a direct link from The Mall (Cribbs Causeway) to the main A38 heading north out of Bristol towards the M5/M4 junction at Almondsbury and, prior to the construction of the Aerospace Bristol museum, granted users a chance to glimpse the Concorde 216 that was stored at the airfield.

In May 2023 it became its own parish council and is no longer part of Patchway Town Council.

==Media==
Local television news programmes are BBC Points West and ITV News West Country both broadcast from Bristol.

The town is served by the local radio stations, BBC Radio Bristol, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio Bristol &amp; The South West, Hits Radio Bristol, BCfm, Kiss and Bradley Stoke Radio, a community based station which is fully operated by volunteers.

Local newspapers are the Bristol Post and Pathway Journal which is an online newspaper.

==Sport==
The town has its own non league football club, Patchway Town F.C. who currently play in the at the Scott Park ground.

<doc id="618868" wikidata="Q442456" url="?curid=618868" title="Black Box Recorder">
<text>Black Box Recorder were an English indie rock band. They debuted in 1998 with &quot;England Made Me&quot; and followed this up with &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;, which gave them their first hit with the single of the same name in April 2000. Their third album, &quot;Passionoia&quot;, was released in 2003. There is also a compilation album, &quot;The Worst of Black Box Recorder&quot;, a collection of B-sides, cover versions and remixes. 

Black Box Recorder consisted of Sarah Nixey, Luke Haines (of The Auteurs), and John Moore (formerly of The Jesus and Mary Chain). Moore and Nixey married in 2001, and had one child. They divorced in 2006. 

Although no official announcement of the band&#x27;s split was made, Black Box Recorder were on hiatus during the mid 2000s. The band collaborated with Art Brut during 2007, and released the single &quot;Christmas Number One&quot; under the name The Black Arts. In October 2008 the band played live at the Nick Sanderson tribute concert at the London Forum.

In late 2008 it was announced the band would be playing a gig at The Luminaire on 18 February 2009. The gig quickly sold out, and a second appearance at the same venue announced. These sold out shows were the band&#x27;s first headlining appearances in five years.

Although an album was planned for 2009, the record was never released. On 16 April 2010, the band announced it would formally split after releasing a final single, &quot;Keep It in the Family&quot; b/w &quot;Do You Believe in God?&quot; on 6 May 2010.

On 17 November 2023, a remastered version of &quot;England Made Me&quot; was released on Spotify for the 25th anniversary of the album.

<text>Paulo Reglus Neves Freire (19 September 1921 – 2 May 1997) was a Brazilian educator and philosopher who was a leading advocate of critical pedagogy. His influential work &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; is generally considered one of the foundational texts of the critical pedagogy movement, and was the third most cited book in the social sciences according to Google Scholar.

==Biography==
Freire was born on 19 September 1921 to a middle-class family in Recife, the State Capital of Pernambuco in the Brazilian Northeast. He became familiar with poverty and hunger from an early age partly due to the effects of the Great Depression. In 1931, Freire moved with his family to Jaboatão dos Guararapes, located 18 kilometers south of the Historic Center of Recife. His father died on 31 October 1934.

During his childhood and adolescence, Freire ended up four grades behind, and his social life revolved around playing pick-up football with other poor children, from whom he claims to have learned a great deal. These experiences shaped his concerns for the poor and helped to construct his particular educational viewpoint. Freire stated that poverty and hunger severely affected his ability to learn. These experiences influenced his decision to dedicate his life to improving the lives of the poor: &quot;I didn&#x27;t understand anything because of my hunger. I wasn&#x27;t dumb. It wasn&#x27;t lack of interest. My social condition didn&#x27;t allow me to have an education. Experience showed me once again the relationship between social class and knowledge&quot;. Eventually, his family&#x27;s misfortunes turned around and their prospects improved.

Freire enrolled in law school at the University of Recife in 1943. He also studied philosophy, more specifically phenomenology, and the psychology of language. Although admitted to the legal bar, he never practiced law and instead worked as a secondary school Portuguese teacher. In 1944, he married Elza Maia Costa de Oliveira, a fellow teacher. The two worked together and had five children.

In 1946, Freire was appointed director of the Pernambuco Department of Education and Culture. Working primarily among the illiterate poor, Freire began to develop an educational praxis that had an influence on the liberation theology movement of the 1970s. In 1940s Brazil, literacy was a requirement for voting in presidential elections.
In 1961, he was appointed director of the Department of Cultural Extension at the University of Recife. In 1962, he had the first opportunity for large-scale application of his theories, when, in an experiment, 300 sugarcane harvesters were taught to read and write in just 45 days. In response to this experiment, the Brazilian government approved the creation of thousands of cultural circles across the country.

The 1964 Brazilian coup d&#x27;état put an end to Freire&#x27;s literacy effort, as the ruling military junta did not endorse it. Freire was subsequently imprisoned as a traitor for 70 days. After a brief exile in Bolivia, Freire worked in Chile for five years for the Christian Democratic Agrarian Reform Movement and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In 1967, Freire published his first book, &quot;Education as the Practice of Freedom&quot;. He followed it up with his most famous work, &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;, which was first published in 1968.

After a positive international reception of his work, Freire was offered a visiting professorship at Harvard University in 1969. The next year, &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; was published in Spanish and English, vastly expanding its reach. Because of political feuds between Freire, a Christian socialist, and Brazil&#x27;s successive right-wing authoritarian military governments, the book went unpublished in Brazil until 1974, when, starting with the presidency of Ernesto Geisel, the military junta started a process of slow and controlled political liberalisation.

Following a year in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Freire moved to Geneva to work as a special education advisor to the World Council of Churches. During this time Freire acted as an advisor on education reform in several former Portuguese colonies in Africa, particularly Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique. In 1979, he first visited Brazil after more than a decade of exile, eventually moving back in 1980. Freire joined the Workers&#x27; Party (PT) in São Paulo and acted as a supervisor for its adult literacy project from 1980 to 1986. When the Workers&#x27; Party won the 1988 São Paulo mayoral elections in 1988, Freire was appointed municipal Secretary of Education. Freire is widely considered the grandfather of Critical Education Theory. Freire died of heart failure on 2 May 1997, in São Paulo.

==Pedagogy==
Freire contributed a philosophy of education which blended classical approaches stemming from Plato and modern Marxist, post-Marxist, and anti-colonialist thinkers. His &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; (1968) can be read as an extension of, or reply to, Frantz Fanon&#x27;s &quot;The Wretched of the Earth&quot; (1961), which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern, rather than traditional, and anti-colonial – not simply an extension of the colonizing culture.

In &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot;, Freire, reprising the oppressors–oppressed distinction, applies the distinction to education, championing that education should allow the oppressed to regain their sense of humanity, in turn overcoming their condition. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that for this to occur, the oppressed individual must play a role in their liberation.
No pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption.
Likewise, oppressors must be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in oppression if true liberation is to occur: &quot;Those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly&quot;.

Freire believed education could not be divorced from politics; the act of teaching and learning are considered political acts in and of themselves. Freire defined this connection as a main tenet of critical pedagogy. Teachers and students must be made aware of the politics that surround education. The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda. Teachers, themselves, have political notions they bring into the classroom. Freire believed that
===Criticism of the &quot;banking model&quot; of education===

In terms of pedagogy, Freire is best known for his criticism of what he called the &quot;banking&quot; concept of education, in which students are viewed as empty accounts to be filled by teachers. He notes that &quot;it transforms students into receiving objects [and] attempts to control thinking and action, lead[ing] men and women to adjust to the world, inhibit[ing] their creative power.&quot; The basic critique was not entirely novel, and paralleled Jean-Jacques Rousseau&#x27;s conception of children as active learners, as opposed to a &quot;tabula rasa&quot; view, more akin to the banking model. John Dewey was also strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education. Dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change, stating that &quot;education is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction&quot;. Freire&#x27;s work revived this view and placed it in context with contemporary theories and practices of education, laying the foundation for what was later termed critical pedagogy.

===Culture of silence===
According to Freire, unequal social relations create a &quot;culture of silence&quot; that instills the oppressed with a negative, passive and suppressed self-image; learners must, then, develop a critical consciousness in order to recognize that this culture of silence is created to oppress. A culture of silence can also cause the &quot;dominated individuals [to] lose the means by which to critically respond to the culture that is forced on them by a dominant culture.&quot;

He considers social, race and class dynamics to be interlaced into the conventional education system, through which this culture of silence eliminates the &quot;paths of thought that lead to a &quot;language of critique&quot;.&quot;

==Legacy and reception==
Since the publication of the English-language edition in 1970, &quot;Pedagogy of the Oppressed&quot; has had a large impact in education and pedagogy worldwide, especially as a defining work of critical pedagogy. According to Israeli writer and education reform theorist Sol Stern, it has &quot;achieved near-iconic status in America&#x27;s teacher-training programs&quot;. Connections have also been made between Freire&#x27;s non-dualism theory in pedagogy and Eastern philosophical traditions such as the Advaita Vedanta.

In 1977, the Adult Learning Project, based on Freire&#x27;s work, was established in the Gorgie-Dalry neighborhood of Edinburgh, Scotland. This project had the participation of approximately 200 people in the first years, and had among its aims to provide affordable and relevant local learning opportunities and to build a network of local tutors. In Scotland, Freire&#x27;s ideas of popular education influenced activist movements not only in Edinburgh but also in Glasgow.

Freire&#x27;s major exponents in North America are bell hooks, Henry Giroux, Peter McLaren, Donaldo Macedo, Antonia Darder, Joe L. Kincheloe, Shirley R. Steinberg, Carlos Alberto Torres, and Ira Shor. One of McLaren&#x27;s edited texts, &quot;Paulo Freire: A Critical Encounter&quot;, expounds upon Freire&#x27;s impact in the field of critical pedagogy. McLaren has also provided a comparative study concerning Paulo Freire and Argentinian revolutionary icon Che Guevara. Freire&#x27;s work influenced the radical math movement in the United States, which emphasizes social justice issues and critical pedagogy as components of mathematical curricula.

In South Africa, Freire&#x27;s ideas and methods were central to the 1970s Black Consciousness Movement, often associated with Steve Biko, as well as the trade union movement in the 1970s and 1980s, and the United Democratic Front in the 1980s. The radical doctor Abu Baker Asvat was among the many prominent anti-apartheid activists who used Freire&#x27;s methods. Today there is a Paulo Freire Project at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Pietermaritzburg and Abahlali baseMjondolo, a radical movement of the urban poor, continues to use Freirian methods.

In 1991, the Paulo Freire Institute was established in São Paulo to extend and elaborate upon his theories of popular education. The institute has started projects in many countries and is headquartered at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, where it actively maintains the Freire archives. Its director is UCLA professor Carlos Torres, the author of several Freirean works, including the 1978 &quot;A praxis educativa de Paulo Freire&quot;.

In 1999 PAULO, a national training organisation named in honour of Freire, was established in the United Kingdom. This agency was approved by the New Labour Government to represent some 300,000 community-based education practitioners working across the UK. PAULO was given formal responsibility for setting the occupational training standards for people working in this field.

The Paulo and Nita Freire Project for International Critical Pedagogy was founded at McGill University. Here Joe L. Kincheloe and Shirley R. Steinberg worked to create a dialogical forum for critical scholars around the world to promote research and re-create a Freirean pedagogy in a multinational domain. After the death of Kincheloe, the project was transformed into a virtual global resource.

In 2012, a group of educators in Western Massachusetts, United States, received permission to name a public school after Freire. The Holyoke, Massachusetts, Paulo Freire Social Justice Charter School opened in September 2013. The school moved to the former Pope Francis Catholic High School building in Chicopee, Massachusetts, in 2019.

In 2012, Paulo Freire Charter High School opened in Newark, New Jersey. The state closed the school in 2017 due to lagging test scores and lack of &quot;instructional rigor.&quot;

Shortly before his death, Freire was working on a book of ecopedagogy, a platform of work carried on by many of the Freire Institutes and Freirean Associations around the world today. It has been influential in helping to develop planetary education projects such as the Earth Charter as well as countless international grassroots campaigns in the spirit of Freirean popular education generally.

Freirean literacy methods have been adopted throughout the developing world. In the Philippines, Catholic &quot;basal Christian communities&quot; adopted Freire&#x27;s methods in community education. Papua New Guinea, Freirean literacy methods were used as part of the World Bank-funded Southern Highlands Rural Development Program&#x27;s Literacy Campaign. Freirean approaches also lie at the heart of the &quot;Dragon Dreaming&quot; approach to community programs that have spread to 20 countries by 2014.

<text>Terry Kevin Austin (born August 23, 1952) is an American comic book creator working primarily as an inker.

==Early life and career==
Austin grew up in Detroit, Michigan, and attended Wayne State University. He started inking comics as an assistant to Dick Giordano and Neal Adams, doing &quot;Crusty Bunker&quot; work for Adams&#x27; Continuity Associates. Austin came to prominence in 1976–1977, inking Marshall Rogers&#x27; pencils on a celebrated run of Batman stories for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Detective Comics&quot; collaborating with writer Steve Englehart. During this same period, Austin inked Michael Netzer (Nasser) on DC&#x27;s Martian Manhunter in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; and Green Arrow/Black Canary in &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, as well as Al Milgrom on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;. He later teamed with Rogers again on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;.
===X-Men===
In 1977, Austin and penciler John Byrne became the new art team on &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot;. With writer Chris Claremont they produced a series of stories — particularly &quot;The Dark Phoenix Saga&quot; — which elevated the title into the top-selling American comic book. (Austin was given the Eagle Award for Favourite Inker three times during this period.)

===Post-X-Men===
Austin left &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; in 1981 and has since worked on a variety of titles for both Marvel and DC, including &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; (over Paul Smith and Dan Green pencils), &quot;Superman&quot; vol. 2 (over Byrne), &quot;Justice League&quot; (over Kevin Maguire) and &quot;Green Lantern&quot; (over Darryl Banks). Austin contributed to several anniversary issues for DC including &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #200 (March 1982), &quot;Superman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1984), and &quot;Batman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1986). He was the regular inker of DC&#x27;s &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; for nearly six years, from 1996–2002. His inking work since 2002 has included over fifteen years of inking the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; comic book series for Archie Comics, which he continued until the series cancellation in 2017.

==Inking style and influence==
Austin&#x27;s inking — especially in the period of the 1970s and early 1980s — is notable for its smooth, precise rendering; and extremely detailed backgrounds, making his embellishing work easily identifiable. His style has been highly influential on a subsequent generation of inkers including Al Gordon, Andy Lanning, Scott Williams, and Rob Liefeld.

==Writing and penciling==
Austin has also worked as a writer, primarily for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; titles and a run on &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot;. Austin wrote and inked the Dark Horse Comics&#x27; adaptation of &quot;Splinter of the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; published in 1995.

His rare penciling jobs can be seen on the covers of &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; #123, #142 and &quot;Annual&quot; #3 (with Frank Miller), as well as his self-published book, &quot;Austin Art: 60 Pages of Drawings by Terry Austin&quot; (2003).

==Personal life==
Austin resides near Poughkeepsie, New York, where he plays volleyball and gets together often with fellow comics veteran Fred Hembeck. Austin&#x27;s affection for the comic strip character Popeye is well-established, and over the years Austin has included drawings of Popeye in various published comics as &quot;Easter eggs&quot; for sharp-eyed readers.

==Awards==
Austin&#x27;s work has gained him frequent and notable recognition over the years, including multiple Eagle Awards for best inker, an Inkpot Award, multiple &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Awards&quot; for Favorite Inker, and the Inkwell Awards 2008 &quot;Favorite Inker (Retro) Award&quot; and the 2009 &quot;Joe Sinnott Award&quot;.

<text>Falfield is a village and a civil parish in the Charfield Ward at the northern border of South Gloucestershire, situated on the A38 Gloucester Road, immediately west of junction 14 of the M5 motorway. In Norman times it was part of the historical Bagstone Hundred of Gloucestershire and later the Thornbury Hundred.

==Geography==
Falfield is at the west of a tributary of the Little Avon River. The linear part of the village along the A38 lies on the Tortworth Beds, sedimentary bedrock made of mudstone formed between 438.5 and 433.4 million years ago in the Silurian period. To the east are areas of calcareous limestone and mudstone and to the west mudstone, siltstone and sandstone of the Mercia Mudstone Group, also sedimentary bedrock formed between 252.2 and 201.3 million years ago during the Triassic. Superficially, there are river terrace sediments of clay, silt and sand formed between 2.588 million years ago and the present during the Quaternary period as well as the alluvium of the Little Avon River which is up to 11,800 years old. The elevation in Falfield at the A38 is 30 metres, whereas at the southwest of Eastwood Farm it reaches 68 metres and northeast of Tortworth Court it reaches 85 metres.

==History==
Although Falfield is not named in the Domesday book, the surrounding parishes of Charfield, Tortworth and Tytherington were all part of the Bagstone Hundred; a few were later transferred to the Thornbury Hundred. Falfield was part of the Lower Thornbury Hundred in 1832.

Falfield appears on maps going back to 1577, upon which it appears as &quot;Fayleffeld&quot;, and clearly in the Thornbury Hundred on a map from 1644 with the same spelling. In 1608 a document, &quot;Men &amp; Armour&quot;, compiled by John Smyth (1567–1641), steward of the Gloucestershire lands of Lord Berkeley, recorded that the majority of the men in the village were weavers and others were husbandmen (farmers) or tailors.

The land around Eastwood was used for hunting from the Tudor period, part of the large estates of Thornbury Castle. The building of Eastwood Park, southwest of the village of Falfield and home of the Jenkinson family associated with the Conservative Party - was begun in 1820 by Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool and Prime Minister. The final additions to the current house were completed in 1865 by George Jenkinson, a Conservative M.P. and 11th baronet resident at Eastwood.

Jenkinson died on 19 January 1892, succeeded by his surviving son George Banks Jenkinson, 12th baronet, who died on 5th June 1915 following pleurisy and pleuro-pneumonia. The contents of the estate were auctioned in February 1916 and the estate itself sold to a resident of Bath. There was a series of owners until it was bought by the Home Office in 1935 and used for civil defence training before and during World War II, followed by police training and NHS engineer training before being sold to Fujitsu in 1997 and finally Eastwood Park Ltd. in 2003. The estate is now used for commercial hire, including civil ceremonies.

The Huntsman&#x27;s Inn - formerly Huntsman&#x27;s House - has served the community since at least the 19th century. The village pump was just south of Huntsman&#x27;s House and the pound was across the road from it along with a smithy.

The ecclesiastical parish of Falfield was formed in 1863; the current parish church, St. Georges&#x27;, was built three years earlier. George Jenkinson (11th baronet) provided part of the funds for the church&#x27;s construction, the rest being raised by subscription. The musician and composer, Charles Harford Lloyd, who was born in Thornbury, served in the local church and came there to play the organ. The church register had entries dating back to 1813, with local entries prior to that included in the registers at Thornbury, 5 kilometres (3 miles) to the southeast. The civil parish of Falfield was constituted in 1896, leaving that of Thornbury.

The road opposite St. George&#x27;s leads to HM Prison Eastwood Park, a women&#x27;s prison with about 400 prisoners.

==Scheduled Monuments==
There are about two dozen scheduled monuments around Falfield. The manor of Tortworth, east of the village, was purchased by Robert Ducie in 1610 and included a 16th-century house (Ducie was later Sheriff and Lord Mayor of London). The listed remains of the old windmill which appears on old maps date from 1708. Heneage Farmhouse, formerly known as Falfield Farmhouse, and Pool Farmhouse date from the mid- to late-17th century. Heneage Court also dates from the 17th century. The existing remains of Falfield Mill - a corn mill - were built in 1797 by the tributary of the Little Avon River that runs to the east of the village centre. Eastwood Park was listed in 1984. The disused Non-Conformist church on the east of Gloucester Road was first built in 1813 before additions. St. George&#x27;s is scheduled, as is the war memorial which was relocated next to it.

==Demographics and governance==
The recorded population of the Charfield Ward which includes Falfield was 5278 at the 2021 United Kingdom census (aggregated data from the 2011 United Kingdom census gave the population of the parish of Falfield as 762 - 280 males and 482 females [including the women&#x27;s prison]).) 96.5% of people in Charfield Ward identified as &quot;White&quot;, 18.7% were disabled under the Equality Act, 75.6% of households were single-family, 41.8% of households were owned and 96% owned a vehicle. 1.6% of people who were not retired were unemployed. 34% of residents had a degree-level education and 12.7% had no qualifications. 4.5% of residents over 16 were full-time students.

Charfield Ward is represented in South Gloucestershire Council by Liberal Democrat councillor John O&#x27;Neill (2025). Charfield is in the Thornbury and Yate parliamentary constituency; from 2024, the local M.P. is Claire Young, also a member of the Liberal Democrats.

<text>Acinetobacter is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the wider class of Gammaproteobacteria. &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species are oxidase-negative, exhibit twitching motility, and occur in pairs under magnification.

They are important soil organisms, where they contribute to the mineralization of, for example, aromatic compounds. &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species are a key source of infection in debilitated patients in the hospital, in particular the species &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot;.

==Description==
Species of the genus &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; are strictly aerobic, nonfermentative, Gram-negative bacilli. They show mostly a coccobacillary morphology on nonselective agar. Rods predominate in fluid media, especially during early growth.

The morphology of &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species can be quite variable in Gram-stained human clinical specimens, and cannot be used to differentiate &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; from other common causes of infection.

Most strains of &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;, except some of the &quot;A. lwoffii&quot; strain, grow well on MacConkey agar (without salt). Although officially classified as not lactose-fermenting, they are often partially lactose-fermenting when grown on MacConkey agar. They are oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, indole-negative, nonmotile, and usually nitrate-negative.

Bacteria of the genus &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; are known to form intracellular inclusions of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain environmental conditions (e.g. lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources).

== Etymology ==
&quot;Acinetobacter&quot; is a compound word from scientific Greek [α + κίνητο + βακτηρ(ία)], meaning nonmotile rod. The first element &quot;acineto-&quot; appears as a somewhat baroque rendering of the Greek morpheme ακίνητο-, commonly transliterated in English is &quot;akineto-&quot;, but actually stems from the French &quot;cinetique&quot; and was adopted directly into English. Nevertheless, the French word also originates from the Greek privative α + κίνησις (motion) confirming the same origin from a different path.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; comprises 38 validly named species.

== Identification ==
Identification of &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species is complicated by lack of standard identification techniques. Initially, identification was based on phenotypic characteristics such as growth temperature, colony morphology, growth medium, carbon sources, gelatin hydrolysis, glucose fermentation, among others. This method allowed identification of &quot;A. calcoaceticus–A. baumannii&quot; complex by the formation of smooth, rounded, mucoid colonies at 37 °C. Closely related species could not be differentiated and individual species such as &quot;A. baumannii&quot; and &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; genomic species 3 could not be positively identified phenotypically.

Because routine identification in the clinical microbiology laboratory is not yet possible, &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; isolates are divided and grouped into three main complexes:
* &quot;Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex&quot;: glucose-oxidising nonhemolytic (&quot;A. baumannii&quot; can be identified by OXA-51 typing)
* &quot;Acinetobacter lwoffii&quot;: glucose-negative nonhemolytic
* &quot;Acinetobacter haemolyticus&quot;: hemolytic

Different species of bacteria in this genus can be identified using fluorescence-lactose-denitrification to find the amount of acid produced by metabolism of glucose. The other reliable identification test at genus level is chromosomal DNA transformation assay. In this assay, a naturally competent tryptophan auxotrophic mutant of &quot;Acinetobacter baylyi&quot; (BD4 trpE27) is transformed with the total DNA of a putative &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; isolate and the transformation mixture is plated on a brain heart infusion agar. The growth is then harvested after incubation for 24 h at 30 °C, plating on an &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; minimal agar (AMA), and incubating at 30 °C for 108 h. Growth on the AMA indicates a positive transformation assay and confirms the isolate as a member of the genus &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;. &quot;E. coli&quot; HB101 and &quot;A. calcoaceticus&quot; MTCC1921T can be used as the negative and positive controls, respectively.

Some of the molecular methods used in species identification are repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR, ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), restriction and sequence analysis of tRNA and 16S-23S rRNA gene spacers and amplified 16S ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). PFGE, AFLP, and ARDRA are validated common methods in use today because of their discriminative ability. However, most recent methods include multilocus sequence typing and multilocus PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which are based on amplification of highly conserved housekeeping genes and can be used to study the genetic relatedness between different isolates.

==Habitat==
&quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species are widely distributed in nature, and commonly occur in soil and water. Their ability to survive on moist and dry surfaces, as well as to survive exposure to various common disinfectants, allows some &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species to survive in a hospital environment. Furthermore, &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species can grow at a broad range of temperatures, allowing them to survive in a broad array of environments.

==Clinical significance==

&quot;Acinetobacter&quot; is frequently isolated in nosocomial infections, and is especially prevalent in intensive care units, where both sporadic cases and epidemic and endemic occurrences are common. &quot;A. baumannii&quot; is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially of late-onset, ventilator-associated pneumonia. It can cause various other infections, including skin and wound infections, bacteremia, and meningitis, but &quot;A. lwoffi&quot; is mostly responsible for the latter.
Of the &quot;Acinetobacter&quot;, &quot;A. baumannii&quot; is the greatest cause of human disease, having been implicated in a number of hospital-acquired infections such as bacteremia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), secondary meningitis, infective endocarditis, and wound and burn infections. In particular, &quot;A. baumannii&quot; is frequently isolated as the cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia among patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Risk factors include long-term intubation and tracheal or lung aspiration. In most cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the equipment used for artificial ventilation such as endotracheal tubes or bronchoscopes serve as the source of infection and result in the colonization of the lower respiratory tract by &quot;A. baumannii&quot;. In some cases, the bacteria can go on to enter the bloodstream, resulting in bacteremia with mortality rates ranging from 32% to 52%. UTIs caused by &quot;A. baumannii&quot; appear to be associated with continuous catheterization, as well as antibiotic therapy. &quot;A. baumannii&quot; has also been reported to infect skin and soft tissue in traumatic injuries and postsurgical wounds. &quot;A. baumannii&quot; commonly infect burns and may result in complications owing to difficulty in treatment and eradication. Though less common, some evidence also links this bacterium to meningitis, most often following invasive surgery, and, in very rare cases, to community-acquired primary meningitis wherein the majority of the victims were children. Case reports also link &quot;A. baumannii&quot; to endocarditis, keratitis, peritonitis, and very rarely fatal neonatal sepsis.
The clinical significance of &quot;A. baumannii&quot; is partially due to its capacity to develop resistance against many available antibiotics. Reports indicate that it possesses resistance against broad-spectrum cephalosporins, β-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. Resistance to carbapenems is also being increasingly reported. &quot;A. baumannii&quot; can survive on the human skin or dry surfaces for weeks and is resistant to a variety of disinfectants, making it particularly easy to spread in a hospital setting. Antibiotic resistance genes are often plasmid-borne, and plasmids present in &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; strains can be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria by horizontal gene transfer.
In healthy individuals, &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; colonies on the skin correlate with low incidence of allergies; &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; is thought to be allergy-protective.

== Treatment ==
&quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species are innately resistant to many classes of antibiotics, including penicillin, chloramphenicol, and often aminoglycosides. Resistance to fluoroquinolones has been reported during therapy, which has also resulted in increased resistance to other drug classes mediated through active drug efflux. A dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance in &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; strains has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the carbapenems are recognised as the gold-standard and treatment of last resort. &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; species are unusual in that they are sensitive to sulbactam, which is commonly used to inhibit bacterial beta-lactamase, but this is an example of the antibacterial property of sulbactam itself. Recently sulbactam-durlobactam, a new antibacterial combination undergoing phase 3 trial, has demonstrated good &quot;in vitro&quot; activity also against carbapenem-resistant &quot;A. baumannii&quot; isolates (92% susceptibility).

In November 2004, the CDC reported an increasing number of &quot;A. baumannii&quot; bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the Iraq/Kuwait region during Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom were treated. Most of these were multidrug-resistant. Among one set of isolates from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 13 (35%) were susceptible to imipenem only, and two (4%) were resistant to all drugs tested. One antimicrobial agent, colistin (polymyxin E), has been used to treat infections with multidrug-resistant &quot;A. baumannii&quot;; however, antimicrobial susceptibility testing for colistin was not performed on isolates described in this report. Because &quot;A. baumannii&quot; can survive on dry surfaces up to 20 days, they pose a high risk of spread and contamination in hospitals, potentially putting immunocompromised and other patients at risk for drug-resistant infections that are often fatal and, in general, expensive to treat. Trials to implement vaccines to prevent Acinetobacter infections were documented.

Reports suggest this bacterium is susceptible to phage therapy.

Gene-silencing antisense oligomers in a form called peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers have also been reported to inhibit growth in tests carried out in animals infected with antibiotic-resistant &quot;A. baumannii&quot;.

Sulbactam/durlobactam (Xacduro) was approved for medical use in the United States in May 2023.

==Aseptic technique==
The frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; infections in a ward were eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser—the infection rate fell to zero.

==Natural transformation==
Bacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from a donor to a recipient bacterium through the intervening liquid medium. Recipient bacteria must first enter a special physiological state termed competence to receive donor DNA. &quot;A. calcoaceticus&quot; is induced to become competent for natural transformation by dilution of a stationary culture into fresh nutrient medium. Competence is gradually lost during prolonged exponential growth and for a period after entrance into the stationary state. The DNA taken up may be used to repair DNA damage or as a means to exchange genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. Natural transformation in &quot;A. calcoaceticus&quot; may protect against exposure to DNA-damaging conditions in the natural environment of these bacteria, as appears to be the case for other bacterial species capable of transformation.

<text>The Thermes de Cluny () are the ruins of Gallo-Roman thermal baths lying in the heart of Paris&#x27; 5th arrondissement, and which are partly subsumed into the Musée national du Moyen Âge - Thermes et hôtel de Cluny.
==History==
The present bath ruins constitute about one-third of a massive bath complex that is believed to have been constructed around the beginning of the 3rd century. The best preserved room is the &quot;frigidarium&quot;, with intact architectural elements such as Gallo-Roman vaults, ribs and consoles, and fragments of original decorative wall painting and mosaics.

It is believed that the bath complex was built by the influential guild of boatmen of 3rd-century Roman Paris or &quot;Lutetia&quot;, as the consoles on which the barrel ribs rest are carved in the shape of ships&#x27; prows. Like all Roman Baths, these baths were freely open to the public, and were meant to be, at least partially, a means of romanizing the ancient Gauls. As the baths lay across the Seine river on the Left Bank and were unprotected by defensive fortifications, they were easy prey to roving barbarian groups, who apparently destroyed the bath complex sometime at the end of the 3rd century.

The bath complex is partly an archaeological site, and has partly been incorporated into the Musée national du Moyen Age (or Musée de Cluny). It is the occasional repository for historic stonework or masonry found from time to time in Paris. The spectacular &quot;frigidarium&quot; is entirely incorporated within the museum and houses the &quot;Pilier des Nautes&quot; (Pillar of the Boatmen). Although somewhat obscured by renovations and reuse over the past two thousand years, several other rooms from the bath complex are also incorporated into the museum, notably the &quot;gymnasium,&quot; which now forms part of gallery 9 (Gallery of French Kings and sculptures from Notre Dame that were taken down during the iconoclasm of the French Revolution). The &quot;caldarium&quot; (hot water room) and the &quot;tepidarium&quot; (warm water room) are both still present as ruins outside the Musée and on the museum&#x27;s grounds.

<text>Lieutenant General George S. Hammond, USAF (Ret.) is a fictional character in the &quot;Stargate franchise&quot;. Played by American actor Don S. Davis, General Hammond serves as the commander of Stargate Command (SGC) in the first seven seasons of the 1997 television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. He is relieved of command in the series&#x27; season 7 finale &quot;Lost City&quot;, but becomes head of the new Homeworld Security department at the beginning of season 8. Hammond&#x27;s off-screen retirement is confirmed in &quot;SG-1&quot;″s season 10, and the character&#x27;s death is mentioned in the series finale of &quot;SG-1&quot;″s spin-off series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Enemy at the Gate&quot;.

Don S. Davis left the regular role after the seventh season of &quot;SG-1&quot; due to health problems, but appeared in later seasons as well as in a season 1 episode of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Davis died from a heart attack in June 2008, making his appearance in the 2008 direct-to-DVD film &quot;&quot; his last. For his portrayal of Hammond, Don S. Davis was nominated for a 2004 Leo Award in the category &quot;Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male&quot; for the season 7 episode &quot;Heroes, Part 2&quot;.

==Role in &quot;Stargate&quot;==
===Character arc===
George S. Hammond is a United States Air Force Major General (later Lieutenant General) from Texas, who commands Stargate Command (SGC) in the first seven seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. The series pilot introduces Hammond as the successor of Major General West, the commander of the Stargate Project in the original &quot;Stargate&quot; film. Hammond had been stationed as a Lieutenant at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex (the present-day location of Stargate Command) in 1969, Hammond&#x27;s mentioned relatives include his wife, who had died of cancer four years before the events of the series began, and his granddaughters named Kayla and Tessa (whose telephone number occupies Hammond&#x27;s first speed dial button above the President of the United States which occupies the second). His father is also mentioned in the Season 2 episode entitled &quot;1969&quot;.

General Hammond has control over each SG mission, but is rarely directly involved with the off-world adventures of SG teams. He is only shown off-world in season 2&#x27;s &quot;Prisoners&quot;, season 3&#x27;s &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and &quot;Forever in a Day&quot;, and the season 7 premiere &quot;Fallen&quot;; he also commands the Earth spaceship &quot;Prometheus&quot; in season 7&#x27;s &quot;Lost City&quot; and season 8&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. Hammond&#x27;s command of the SGC is interrupted once in season 4&#x27;s &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, where Hammond retires under duress and is temporarily replaced by Major General Bauer. The series never clearly establishes Hammond&#x27;s second-in-command, although producer Joseph Mallozzi stated in season 7 that &quot;if Hammond were to retire, there&#x27;s a strong possibility that [Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neill] could take over command of the [Stargate Command] base&quot;.

In the season 7 finale &quot;Lost City&quot;, newly inaugurated President Henry Hayes is pressured into replacing General Hammond with Dr. Elizabeth Weir for a three-month review process of the SGC. Hammond is promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and is placed in command of the new Homeworld Security department afterwards; Brigadier General Jack O&#x27;Neill takes over command of Stargate Command in the season 8 opener &quot;New Order&quot;. Hammond appears in the season 1 episode &quot;Home&quot; of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; (although this was an illusion of Hammond created by telepathic aliens), and appears in seasons 8 through 10 of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. After Hammond appears in season 9&#x27;s &quot;The Fourth Horseman&quot; in a civilian suit instead of a military uniform, Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter confirms Hammond&#x27;s retired status in season 10&#x27;s &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot; when meeting an alternate version of Hammond who remains in charge of the SGC. In his last appearance in the alternate timeline film &quot;&quot;, General Hammond acts as a military advisor to President Henry Hayes. Carter reports to Lieutenant Colonel John Sheppard in the &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; Season 5 finale/series finale episode, &quot;Enemy at the Gate&quot; that Hammond recently died from a heart attack and that the &quot;Daedalus&quot;-class ship &quot;Phoenix&quot; was renamed the &quot;George Hammond&quot; in his honor.

===Characterization and relationships===
According to &quot;Approaching The Possible&quot; by Jo Storm, the season 2 episode &quot;1969&quot; showed that Hammond climbed the military ladder &quot;by being shrewd, intelligent, and [by being] possessed of a long vision&quot; despite being a &quot;spouted bottom-line pragmatis[t]&quot;. Don S. Davis described General Hammond as initially &quot;hard-nosed and straight-ahead&quot;, and later as seemingly &quot;stern and straight-laced&quot;. Recognizing the need to fulfill the role as a General, Davis still tried to &quot;bring a few levels to him that show some understanding and that make him a little more likeable.&quot; The welfare of the men and women under Hammond&#x27;s command is paramount in the general&#x27;s mind. Besides knowing that people may not return from his sanctioned missions, General Hammond has to decide when to forgo rescue attempts to not put more lives in danger, even if he &quot;always does so reluctantly and with regret&quot;. As shown in &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, Hammond would rather leave the military quietly than risk the careers and lives of his staff and his family, &quot;which must go against all his blustery Texas background&quot;.

Davis appreciated Hammond&#x27;s closeness to the SG-1 team and his willingness to compromise. At the beginning of the series, Hammond does not accept the alien warrior Teal&#x27;c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal&#x27;c&#x27;s devotion to the Stargate Program. Despite his admiration for Dr. Daniel Jackson&#x27;s enthusiasm in the beginning, Hammond has a hard time understanding Daniel&#x27;s unorthodox and non-military approach to problems until Hammond comes to realize the importance of a civilian viewpoint to SG-1&#x27;s mission. When the alien Jonas Quinn joins SG-1 in season 6, Davis compared Hammond&#x27;s response to Jonas to his reaction to Teal&#x27;c in season 1. Although Hammond does not blame Jonas for Daniel&#x27;s death in &quot;Meridian&quot;, &quot;the situation does make it difficult for [Hammond] to totally take the young man under his wing and embrace him like family as he has the rest of SG-1&quot;. Davis named the NID as Hammond&#x27;s only source of frustration, since they regularly outflank Hammond and SG-1. Hammond&#x27;s only option is to call the President for support, but most cases end with SG-1 or Hammond breaking the rules to assure the survival of humanity, so &quot;Hammond will do whatever he must to get things done&quot;.

==Conceptual history==
Don S. Davis was a stand-in and stunt-double for Dana Elcar in &quot;MacGyver&quot;, a 1985–1992 television series that starred Richard Dean Anderson (who also portrayed &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;″s lead character Jack O&#x27;Neill). At the time, Davis had suffered burnout from teaching acting classes at the University of British Columbia for ten years, and later considered the work on &quot;MacGyver&quot; &quot;a new lease on life&quot;. When the producers cast &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in 1996, they asked Davis to read for the role of George Hammond and contracted him for multiple years. Davis considered General Hammond in the initial character breakdown as a two-dimensional by-the-book character and a mere foil for O&#x27;Neill, and was dissatisfied with the view of the pilot episode&#x27;s director, Mario Azzopardi, who in particular wanted Hammond to be a military stereotype. Davis, who had served as an army Captain in Korea in the 1960s, felt that the character breakdown did not mirror the reality of military service, and he was reluctant to portray such a role for several years. The producers eventually allowed Davis to humanize the character during the run of the show.

The producers wrote season 4&#x27;s &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; as &quot;a bit of a Hammond episode&quot; after they had not devoted an episode to Hammond during the first three seasons. The episode ended up &quot;very different&quot; from writer Joseph Mallozzi&#x27;s original pitch, which he had envisioned as &quot;a Hammond story in which the general faces a court martial after being implicated in the death of an off-world SG team leader&quot;. When no more Hammond episodes were written in the following seasons, Davis cited &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;″s focus on the off-world adventures of the SG team, the military framework and the general&#x27;s knowledge for why Hammond &quot;can be nothing more than peripheral to that action.&quot;

After playing General Hammond for nearly 150 episodes in seven seasons, Don S. Davis decided to leave &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in late 2003. He had suffered from prolonged health problems and was grateful that the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; producers had previously continued his employment and had scheduled episodes around his surgeries. Davis turned towards painting and sculpting, but continued to work in the film and television industry including the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise, continuing to appear in every season of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Davis died from a heart attack at the age of 65 on June 29, 2008, shortly before the release of &quot;Stargate: Continuum&quot;, his last on-screen appearance as General Hammond. The &quot;Stargate&quot; producers closed the final &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; episode, &quot;Enemy at the Gate&quot;, with a dedication card to Don S. Davis; the episode also mentions the off-screen passing of General Hammond, with Earth&#x27;s newest ship being named in his honor.

==Reception==
Jo Storm commended Don S. Davis in her book &quot;Approaching The Possible&quot; for &quot;bring[ing] out his character&#x27;s actions and motivations with the confidence and thoughtfulness that only a professional of many years can&quot;. In the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; pilot, Hammond &quot;set[s] up things as advantageously as he can&quot; and proved to be a &quot;competent&quot; and &quot;believable&quot; commander. Talking about Hammond in the season 2 time-travel episode &quot;1969&quot;, Storm also credited actor Aaron Pearl, who had done &quot;an amazing job as the younger George Hammond, right down to the slight head tilt and speech lilt&quot;. For his portrayal of Hammond, Don S. Davis was nominated for a 2004 Leo Award in the category &quot;Dramatic Series: Best Supporting Performance by a Male&quot; for the season 7 episode &quot;Heroes, Part 2&quot;.

<doc id="618910" wikidata="Q1351381" url="?curid=618910" title="Ototoxicity">
<text>Ototoxicity is the property of being toxic to the ear (&quot;oto-&quot;), specifically the cochlea or auditory nerve and sometimes the vestibular system, for example, as a side effect of a drug. The effects of ototoxicity can be reversible and temporary, or irreversible and permanent. 
It has been recognized since the 19th century. 
There are many well-known ototoxic drugs used in clinical situations, and they are prescribed, despite the risk of hearing disorders, for very serious health conditions. 
Ototoxic drugs include antibiotics (such as gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin), loop diuretics (such as furosemide), and platinum-based chemotherapy agents (such as cisplatin and carboplatin). A number of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) have also been shown to be ototoxic. This can result in sensorineural hearing loss, dysequilibrium, or both. Some environmental and occupational chemicals have also been shown to affect the auditory system and interact with noise.

==Signs and symptoms==
Ototoxicity results in cochlear and/or vestibular dysfunction which can manifest as sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, dizziness, vertigo, or imbalance. Presentation of symptoms vary in singularity, onset, severity and reversibility.

=== Auditory symptoms ===

==== Hearing loss ====
Ototoxicity-induced hearing loss typically impacts the high frequency range, affecting above 8000 Hz prior to impacting frequencies below. There is not global consensus on measuring severity of ototoxicity-induced hearing loss as there are many criteria available to define and measure ototoxicity-induced hearing loss. Guidelines and criteria differ between children and adults.

===== Ototoxicity grades (Hearing Loss) =====
There are at least 13 classifications for ototoxicity. Examples of ototoxicity grades for hearing loss are the National Cancer Institute&#x27;s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Brock&#x27;s Hearing Loss Grades, Tune grading system, and Chang grading system.

National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (as described in the American Academy of Audiology Ototoxicity Monitoring Guidelines from 2009):

* &quot;Grade 1:&quot; Threshold shift or loss of 15-25 dB relative to baseline, averaged at two or more contiguous frequencies in at least one ear
* &quot;Grade 2:&quot; Threshold shift or loss of &gt;25-90 dB, averaged at two contiguous test frequencies in at least one ear

==== Hyperacusis ====
Hyperacusis is abnormally increased sensitivity to intensity (perceived as loudness) to what is typically deemed as normal/tolerable loudness.

=== Vestibular symptoms ===
Vestibular symptoms from ototoxicity, which would specifically be vestibulotoxicity, can include general dizziness, vertigo, imbalance, and oscillopsia. 

==Ototoxic agents==

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics in the aminoglycoside class, such as gentamicin and tobramycin, may produce cochleotoxicity through a poorly understood mechanism. It may result from antibiotic binding to NMDA receptors in the cochlea and damaging neurons through excitotoxicity. Aminoglycoside-induced production of reactive oxygen species may also injure cells of the cochlea. Once-daily dosing and co-administration of &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine may protect against aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. The anti-bacterial activity of aminoglycoside compounds is due to inhibition of ribosome function and these compounds similarly inhibit protein synthesis by mitochondrial ribosomes because mitochondria evolved from a bacterial ancestor. Consequently, aminoglycoside effects on production of reactive oxygen species as well as dysregulation of cellular calcium ion homeostasis may result from disruption of mitochondrial function. Ototoxicity of gentamicin can be exploited to treat some individuals with Ménière&#x27;s disease by destroying the inner ear, which stops the vertigo attacks but causes permanent deafness.
Due to the effects on mitochondria, certain inherited mitochondrial disorders result in increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of aminoglycosides.

Macrolide antibiotics, including erythromycin, are associated with reversible ototoxic effects. The underlying mechanism of ototoxicity may be impairment of ion transport in the stria vascularis. Predisposing factors include renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and recent organ transplantation.

===Loop diuretics===
Certain types of diuretics are associated with varying levels of risk for ototoxicity. Loop and thiazide diuretics carry this side effect. The loop diuretic furosemide is associated with ototoxicity, particularly when doses exceed 240 mg per hour. The related compound ethacrynic acid has a higher association with ototoxicity, and is therefore used only in patients with sulfa allergies. Diuretics are thought to alter the ionic gradient within the stria vascularis. Bumetanide confers a decreased risk of ototoxicity compared to furosemide.

===Chemotherapeutic agents===
Platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents, including cisplatin and carboplatin, are associated with cochleotoxicity characterized by progressive, high-frequency hearing loss with or without tinnitus (ringing in the ears). Ototoxicity is less frequently seen with the related compound oxaliplatin. The severity of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is dependent upon the cumulative dose administered and the age of the patient, with young children being most susceptible. The exact mechanism of cisplatin ototoxicity is not known. The drug is understood to damage multiple regions of the cochlea, causing the death of outer hair cells, as well as damage to the spiral ganglion neurons and cells of the stria vascularis. Long-term retention of cisplatin in the cochlea may contribute to the drug&#x27;s cochleotoxic potential. Once inside the cochlea, cisplatin has been proposed to cause cellular toxicity through a number of different mechanisms, including through the production of reactive oxygen species. The decreased incidence of oxaliplatin ototoxicity has been attributed to decreased uptake of the drug by cells of the cochlea. Administration of amifostine has been used in attempts to prevent cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, but the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends against its routine use.

The &quot;vinca&quot; alkaloids, including vincristine, are also associated with reversible ototoxicity.

===Antiseptics and disinfectants===

Topical skin preparations such as chlorhexidine and ethyl alcohol have the potential to be ototoxic should they enter the inner ear through the round window membrane. This potential was first noted after a small percentage of patients undergoing early myringoplasty operations experienced severe sensorineural hearing loss. It was found that in all operations involving this complication the preoperative sterilization was done with chlorhexidine. The ototoxicity of chlorhexidine was further confirmed by studies with animal models.

Several other skin preparations have been shown to be potentially ototoxic in the animal model. These preparations include acetic acid, propylene glycol, quaternary ammonium compounds, and any alcohol-based preparations. However, it is difficult to extrapolate these results to human ototoxicity because the human round window membrane is much thicker than in any animal model.

===Other medicinal ototoxic drugs===
At high doses, quinine, aspirin and other salicylates may also cause high-pitch tinnitus and hearing loss in both ears, typically reversible upon discontinuation of the drug. Erectile dysfunction medications may have the potential to cause hearing loss. However the link between erectile dysfunction medications and hearing loss remains uncertain.

Previous noise exposure has not been found to potentiate ototoxic hearing loss. The American Academy of Audiology includes in their position statement that exposure to noise at the same time as aminoglycosides may exacerbate ototoxicity. The American Academy of Audiology recommends people being treated with ototoxic chemotherapeutics avoid excessive noise levels during treatment and for several months following cessation of treatment. Opiates in combination with excessive noise levels may also have an additive effect on ototoxic hearing loss.

=== Ototoxicants in the environment and workplace ===
Ototoxic effects are also seen with quinine, pesticides, solvents, asphyxiants, and heavy metals such as mercury and lead. When combining multiple ototoxicants, the risk of hearing loss becomes greater. As these exposures are common, this hearing impairment can affect workers in many occupations and industries. This risk probably been overlook because individual hearing tests conducted on workers, pure tone audiometry, does not allow one to determine if a hearing effects are a consequence of noise or chemical exposure. 

Examples of activities that often have exposures to both noise and solvents include:

* Printing
* Painting
* Construction
* Fueling vehicles and aircraft
* Firefighting
* Weapons firing
* Pesticide spraying

Ototoxic chemicals in the environment (from contaminated air or water) or in the workplace interact with mechanical stresses on the hair cells of the cochlea caused by noise in different ways. For mixtures containing organic solvents such as toluene, styrene or xylene, the combined exposure with noise increases the risk of occupational hearing loss in a synergistic manner. The risk is greatest when the co-exposure is with impulse noise. Carbon monoxide has been shown to increase the severity of the hearing loss from noise. Given the potential for enhanced risk of hearing loss, exposures and contact with products such as fuels, paint thinners, degreasers, white spirits, exhaust, should be kept to a minimum. Noise exposures should be kept below 85 decibels, and the chemical exposures should be below the recommended exposure limits given by regulatory agencies.

Drug exposures mixed with noise potentially lead to increased risk of ototoxic hearing loss. Noise exposure combined with the chemotherapeutic cisplatin puts individuals at increased risk of ototoxic hearing loss. Noise at 85 dB SPL or above added to the amount of hair cell death in the high frequency region of the cochlea in chinchillas.

The hearing loss caused by chemicals can be very similar to a hearing loss caused by excessive noise. A 2018 informational bulletin by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) introduces the issue, provides examples of ototoxic chemicals, lists the industries and occupations at risk and provides prevention information.

== Ototoxicity Monitoring/Management ==
Several guidelines have been published around the world, though there is not consensus on one universally agreed-upon protocol.

Guidelines released:
* The American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA) released guidelines in 1994. There are details on the different monitoring procedures on timelines depending on age and responsiveness.

* The American Academy of Audiology (AAA) released guidelines in 2009. There are details on the kinds of tests which can be used.

* The Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPSCA) released guidelines in 2018.

=== Auditory testing ===
Auditory testing involved in ototoxicity monitoring/management (OtoM) is typically general audiological evaluation, high frequency audiometry (HFA), and otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). High frequency audiometry evaluates hearing thresholds beyond 8000 Hz, which is the typical cut-off for conventional audiometry. It is recommended a baseline evaluation be performed prior to treatment beginning.

==== Significant change criteria ====
There are several guidelines on what constitutes a significant change in hearing which can indicate further action must be taken, whether that be to implement aural rehabilitation or adjust the source of ototoxic exposure (eg. chemotherapy). With pure tone audiometry, ASHA considers a significant change to have occurred if there is a:

* ≥ 20 dB decrease in pure tone thresholds at any test frequency OR
* ≥ 10 dB decrease at two adjacent frequencies OR
* no response at three consecutive test frequencies where responses were previously obtained

If using distortion product ototoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), a significant shift is observed if there is a reduction in amplitude by 6 dB or more than the baseline within the sensitive range of ototoxicity.

=== Vestibular testing ===
Vestibular tests for vestibulotoxicity specifically can include caloric testing, rotational testing, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), and computerized dynamic posturography (CDP); however, there are no globally accepted guidelines for monitoring/management of vestibular function during or following ototoxic treatments.

<text>Klinik, (sometimes called The Klinik), is an industrial music band from Belgium, originally formed around 1982 by electro-synthpop practitioner Marc Verhaeghen, who is the only constant member.

==History==
Marc Verhaeghen originally formed Klinik in the early-to-mid 1980s; the exact date varies depending on the source. The group is normally described as one of the most influential Belgian industrial bands in history.

In 1985, Verhaeghen joined forces with two other bands, Absolute Body Control (with Dirk Ivens and Eric van Wonterghem), and &quot;The Maniacs&quot; (Sandy Nijs) to form one &quot;super group&quot; &quot;Absolute Controlled Clinical Maniacs&quot;. This rather unwieldy name was soon dropped in favour of the shorter name &quot;The Klinik&quot;. Through their connection with Sandy Nijs and his involvement in the international cassette trading network, Klinik received an offer to tour Norway in 1985.

Nijs soon left the band to form &quot;Hybryds&quot;, followed in 1987 by van Wonterghem, leaving The Klinik as the &quot;classic&quot; duo of Dirk Ivens and Marc Verhaeghen.

The Klinik soon made a name for themselves with their cold and harsh EBM sound and their live shows, where both Ivens and Verhaeghen performed with their heads wrapped in gauze, wearing long black leather coats. Ivens&#x27; hissing vocals and minimalist lyrics were complemented by Verhaeghen&#x27;s synthesizer skills and distorted trombone playing. This however, did not last forever; after &quot;Time&quot;, an album neither member was fully pleased with, musical differences became too great, and they decided to go their separate ways. In a 2013 interview, Ivens said the duo were moving in different directions musically, and that compromise between only two members was challenging.

Ivens concentrated on his own project Dive, and Verhaeghen continued as Klinik (dropping the definite article from the band name at this point); sometimes as a solo project, sometimes with various other members.

Most Klinik members have also been active outside the band. Ivens has been in bands such as Absolute Body Control, Dive, Sonar, and Blok 57; Eric van Wonterghem played with Ivens in Absolute Body Control, and has later been part of or collaborating with bands such as Insekt, Monolith, Dive and Sonar. Sandy Nijs formed Hybryds already around his departure in 1986, a project which is still active.

Verhaeghen has been involved in several projects outside Klinik, including Noise Unit (with Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly), D.Sign (with Philippe and Eliane Fichot of Die Form), X10 (with Niki Mono, Marc Ickx of A Split-Second and Vidna Obmana), and Para (with his own wife Sabine Voss).

Ivens and Verhaeghen briefly reunited for a few concerts in 2003/2004, one of which was released as a CD in September 2004. The reunion was not intended to last, but by 2008 Ivens and Verhaeghen decided to begin working on new material together as Klinik. Soon after, Verhaeghen fell ill which delayed production of the new album. While Verhaeghen convalesced, Ivens continued touring as Klinik, joined on stage by Peter Mastbooms (of Pressure Control and The Juggernauts).

The band&#x27;s first album featuring both Verhaeghen and Ivens in 22 years, &quot;Eat Your Heart Out&quot;, was released by Out Of Line Records (Berlin) on CD and also in a limited pressing of 500 white and 200 black vinyl copies on 1 March 2013.

<doc id="618921" wikidata="Q1209683" url="?curid=618921" title="Dick Giordano">
<text>Richard Joseph Giordano (; July 20, 1932 – March 27, 2010) was an American comics artist and editor whose career included introducing Charlton Comics&#x27; &quot;Action Heroes&quot; stable of superheroes and serving as executive editor of DC Comics.

==Early life==
Dick Giordano, an only child, was born in New York City on July 20, 1932, in the borough of Manhattan to Josephine Labruzzi and Graziano &quot;Jack&quot; Giordano. He attended the School of Industrial Art.

==Career==

===Charlton Comics===
Beginning as a freelance artist at Charlton Comics in 1952, Giordano contributed artwork to dozens of the company&#x27;s comics, including such Western titles as &quot;Annie Oakley&quot;, &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;, and &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, the war comic &quot;Fightin&#x27; Army&quot;, and scores of covers.

Giordano&#x27;s artwork from Charlton&#x27;s &quot;Strange Suspense Stories&quot; was used as inspiration for artist Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s 1965/1966 Brushstroke series, including &quot;Brushstroke&quot;, &quot;Big Painting No. 6&quot;, &quot;Little Big Painting&quot; and &quot;Yellow and Green Brushstrokes&quot;.

By the mid-1960s a Charlton veteran, Giordano rose to executive editor, succeeding Pat Masulli, by 1965. As an editor, he made his first mark in the industry, overseeing Charlton&#x27;s revamping of its few existing superheroes and having his artists and writers create new such characters for what he called the company&#x27;s &quot;Action Hero&quot; line. Many of these artists included new talent Giordano brought on board, including Jim Aparo, Dennis O&#x27;Neil, and Steve Skeates.

===DC Comics===
DC Comics vice president Irwin Donenfeld hired Giordano as an editor in April 1968, at the suggestion of Steve Ditko, with Giordano bringing over to DC some of the creators he had nurtured at Charlton. Giordano was given several titles such as &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, &quot;Aquaman&quot; and &quot;Young Love&quot;, but none of DC&#x27;s major series. He launched the horror comics series &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; in March 1969. and the Western series &quot;All-Star Western&quot; vol. 2 in September 1970.

He continued to freelance for DC as a penciler and inker. As an artist, Giordano was best known as an inker. His inking was particularly associated with the pencils of Neal Adams, for their run in the early 1970s on the titles &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Green Lantern/Green Arrow&quot;. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that &quot;The influential Adams style moved comics closer to illustration than cartooning, and he brought a menacing mood to Batman&#x27;s adventures that was augmented by Dick Giordano&#x27;s dark, brooding inks.&quot;

===Continuity Associates===
By 1971, frustrated by what he felt was a lack of editorial opportunities, Giordano had left DC to partner with fellow artist Neal Adams for their Continuity Associates studios, which served as an art packager for comic book publishers, including such companies as Giordano&#x27;s former employer Charlton Comics, Marvel Comics, and the one-shot &quot;Big Apple Comix&quot;. Several comics artists began their careers at Continuity and many were mentored by Giordano during their time there.

He had a brief run as penciler of the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series which included a two-issue story in issues #202–203 (October and December 1972) written by science-fiction author Samuel R. Delany. Giordano drew several backup stories in &quot;Action Comics&quot; featuring the Human Target character as well as the martial arts feature &quot;Sons of the Tiger&quot; in Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white comics magazine &quot;The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu&quot;. He was a frequent artist on &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and he and writer Denny O&#x27;Neil created the Batman supporting character Leslie Thompkins in the story &quot;There Is No Hope in Crime Alley&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #457 (March 1976). Giordano inked the large-format, first DC/Marvel intercompany crossover, &quot;Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (1976), over the pencils of Ross Andru. Giordano inked Adams on the one-shot &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot; in 1978. Throughout the late 1970s and the early 1980s, Ross Andru and Giordano were DC&#x27;s primary cover artists, providing cover artwork for the Superman titles as well as covers for many of the other comics in the DC line at that time.

===Return to DC===
In 1980, DC publisher Jenette Kahn brought Giordano back to DC. Initially the editor of the Batman titles, Giordano was named the company&#x27;s new managing editor in 1981, and promoted to vice president/executive editor in 1983, a position he held until 1993. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed in 2010 that &quot;Giordano held the respect of talent as one of their own, and kept their affection with his reassuring calm and warmth.&quot;

Giordano provided art for several anniversary issues of key DC titles. He and television writer Alan Brennert crafted the story &quot;To Kill a Legend&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #500 (March 1981). Giordano was one of the artists on the double-sized &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #200 (March 1982) as well as &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #300 (Feb. 1983). He was promoted to Vice-President/Executive Editor in 1984, and with Kahn and Levitz, oversaw the relaunch of all of DC&#x27;s major characters with the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; limited series in 1985. This was followed by Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons&#x27; &quot;Watchmen&quot; in 1986. Giordano inked several major projects during this time such as George Pérez&#x27;s pencils on &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; and John Byrne&#x27;s pencils on &quot;The Man of Steel&quot; and &quot;Action Comics&quot;, though during this period he always employed assistants for inking backgrounds, filling in large black areas, and making final erasures.

From 1983 to 1987, Giordano wrote a monthly column published in DC titles called &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; which much like Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Bullpen Bulletins&quot; featured news and information about the company and its creators. Unlike &quot;Bullpen Bulletins,&quot; which was characterized by an ironic, over-hyped tone, Giordano&#x27;s columns &quot;. . . were written in a relatively sober, absolutely friendly voice, like a friend of your father&#x27;s you particularly liked and didn&#x27;t mind sitting down to listen to.&quot; Giordano closed each &quot;Meanwhile...&quot; column with the characteristic words, &quot;Thank you and good afternoon.&quot;

The Vertigo imprint was launched in early 1993 built upon the success of several titles edited by Karen Berger including &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Sandman&quot;, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot;, &quot;Animal Man&quot;, and &quot;Shade, the Changing Man&quot;. Giordano inked six issues of &quot;The Sandman&quot; in 1991–1993.

===Creators&#x27; rights===
Beginning in 1987, Giordano was in the middle of an industry-wide debate about the comics industry, ratings systems, and creators&#x27; rights. Veteran writers Mike Friedrich, Steven Grant, and Roger Slifer all cited Giordano in particular for his hard-line stance on behalf of DC. This debate led in part to the 1988 drafting of the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights.

===Later career===

Giordano left DC in 1993, and still did the occasional inking job, but later returned to freelancing full-time. In 1994 Giordano illustrated a graphic novel adaptation of the novel &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; released by DC Comics, with creator/writer Peter O&#x27;Donnell. He was one of the many artists who contributed to the &quot;&quot; one-shot in 1996 wherein the title character married Lois Lane.

In 2002, Giordano launched the short-lived Future Comics with writer David Michelinie and artist Bob Layton. Since 2002, Giordano had drawn several issues of &quot;The Phantom&quot; published in Europe and Australia. In 2004, Giordano and writer Roy Thomas completed an adaptation of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; novel. They had begun the project in 1974 but the cancellation of many of Marvel&#x27;s black and white magazines put it into limbo. The finished story was collected into a hardcover edition in 2005 and a colorized hardcover edition in 2010. In 2005, F+W Publications Inc. published the instructional art book &quot;Drawing Comics with Dick Giordano&quot;, which he wrote and illustrated. His last mainstream work appeared in &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; vol. 2, #51 (March 2010) for which he drew the interior art and the cover. His last comics work was pencilling and editing &quot;Baron Five&quot;, published by Hound Comics.

==Personal life==
Giordano married the former Marie Trapani, sister of fellow comics artist Sal Trapani, on April 17, 1955. She died from complications of her second stomach cancer surgery in February 1993. They had three children together; Lisa, Dawn, and Richard Jr. Marie&#x27;s death, combined with Giordano&#x27;s increasing hearing loss, hastened his decision to retire from DC. Following the death of his wife, Giordano split time between homes in Florida and Connecticut. In 1995, he moved to Palm Coast, Florida, where he continued to work full-time freelancing, until his death. Giordano had suffered from lymphoma and later from leukemia, secondary to the chemotherapy. He died on March 27, 2010, due to complications of treatment for leukemia.

==Legacy==
Giordano served as mentor or inspiration to a generation of inkers, including Terry Austin, Mike DeCarlo, and Bob Layton.

Shortly after Giordano&#x27;s death in 2010, The Hero Initiative created &quot;The Dick Giordano Humanitarian of the Year Award&quot;, which debuted at the 2010 Harvey Awards ceremony held at the Baltimore Comic-Con. The award recognizes one person in comics each year who demonstrates particular generosity and integrity in support of the overall comic book community.

==Awards==
Giordano received recognition in the industry for his work, including the Alley Award for Best Editor in 1969. He won the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) in 1970 (for &quot;Green Lantern&quot;), 1971, 1973 (for &quot;Justice League of America&quot;), and 1974. He won the 1971 Goethe Award for &quot;Favorite Pro Editor.&quot; Giordano received an Inkpot Award in 1981. In 2009 he was awarded the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame Award.

He has written popular children&#x27;s books such as &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot;, &quot;Max the Mighty&quot;, &quot;The Last Book in the Universe&quot;, and has written other mysteries and thrillers for adults.

Writing as Chris Jordan, Philbrick has published novels in the thriller genre: &quot;Taken&quot;, &quot;Trapped&quot;, and &quot;Torn&quot;, featuring former FBI special agent Randall Shane, who investigates the disappearance of missing children.

Two of his most popular children&#x27;s books are &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Max the Mighty&quot;. &quot;Freak the Mighty&quot; was later adapted into a movie titled &quot;The Mighty&quot;.

Other works for young readers include &quot;The Young Man and the Sea&quot;, which is dedicated to his nieces Annie and Molly, and &quot;The Fire Pony&quot;, about two brothers on the run in the American West. &quot;The Mostly True Adventures of Homer P. Figg&quot;, set in the American Civil War, was named a Newbery Honor Book in 2010. A stage version of &quot;The Mostly True Adventures of Homer P.

He and Lynn Harnett collaborated on scary books for young readers, including &quot;The House on Cherry Street&quot;, &quot;The Werewolf Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;Visitors&quot;, three trilogies published by Scholastic, Inc.

In December 2011, writing as Chris Jordan, Philbrick published &quot;Measure of Darkness&quot;, set in Boston. According to the author, Randall Shane enters the story in the first chapter, when he is accused of murdering a client. &quot;Zane and The Hurricane: A Story of Katrina&quot;, an adventure set in New Orleans, was published in February 2014. &quot;The Big Dark&quot; was released in print and audio versions in January 2016.

<doc id="618928" wikidata="Q6238114" url="?curid=618928" title="Monoculturalism">
<text>Monoculturalism is the policy or process of supporting, advocating, or allowing the expression of the culture of a single social or ethnic group. It generally stems from beliefs within the dominant group that their cultural practices are superior to those of minority groups and is often related to the concept of ethnocentrism, which involves judging another culture based on the values and standards of one&#x27;s own culture, though this is usually untrue if cultural nationalism is dominant, as opposed to ethno-nationalism. It may also involve the process of assimilation whereby other ethnic groups are expected to adopt the culture and practices of the dominant ethnic group. Monoculturalism, in the context of cultural diversity, is the opposite of multiculturalism. 
Rather than the suppression of different ethnic groups within a given society, sometimes monoculturalism manifests as the active preservation of a country&#x27;s national culture via the exclusion of external influences. Japan, South Korea, and North Korea are examples of this form of monoculturalism. However it may also be the result of less intentional factors such as geographic isolation, historical racial homogeneity, or political isolation. 

== Ethnocentric monoculturalism ==
Monoculturalism is often closely associated with ethnocentrism. Ethnocentrism is the practice of framing one&#x27;s way of life as natural and valid, and applying that belief system to interpret the characteristics of other cultures.

== Instances ==

=== In genocide ===
Many of the genocides practiced throughout history were based on ethnic supremacy. Ethnic supremacy is assumed by one group within a culture, following some distinct action by an external group or from one of the ethnic groups. With European intervention in places like Rwanda, social institutions worked to socially construct an ethnic inferiority, distinguishing the Hutus and Tutsis from one another and causing what would be one of the most horrific demonstrations of genocide in modern history.

A similar example to that of the Rwandan genocide was the ongoing civil war in Burma. The civil war spanned from a constitution that granted Burma their independence from the British Empire in which a group of leaders created conditions that didn&#x27;t involve many of Burma&#x27;s Ethnic Minorities, and instigated a fight from them. Many of these ethnic minorities in Burma, including the Karen, have been significantly displaced by the military junta and placed into refugee camps in bordering nations. The remaining ethnic minorities have been living in poor conditions, and have been met by a variety of human rights abuses.

=== Globalization ===
Globalization involves the free movement of goods, capital, services, people, technology and information throughout the world. It also involves the international integration of potentially very different countries through the adoption of the same or similar world views, ideologies, and other aspects of culture. Marsella argues that this is monoculturalism on a grand scale. Potentially it could lead to the suppression and loss of different ethnic cultures on a global scale.

<doc id="618929" wikidata="Q492214" url="?curid=618929" title="Ghostbusters II">
<text>GhostbustersII is a 1989 American supernatural comedy film directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. The film stars Bill Murray, Aykroyd, Sigourney Weaver, Ramis, Rick Moranis, Ernie Hudson, and Annie Potts. It is the sequel to the 1984 film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and the second film in the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; franchise. Set five years after the events of the first film, the Ghostbusters have been sued and put out of business after the destruction caused during their battle with the deity Gozer the Gozerian. When a new paranormal threat emerges, the Ghostbusters reunite to combat it and save the world.

After the success of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Columbia Pictures wanted a sequel but struggled to overcome objections from the cast and crew. As with the first film, Aykroyd and Ramis collaborated on the script, which went through many variations. The pair wanted to convey a message about the consequences of negative human emotions in large cities. They settled on the idea of negative feelings creating a mass of supernatural slime beneath New York City that empowers malevolent spirits. With a budget of $30–40 million, filming took place between November 1988 and March 1989 in New York City and Los Angeles. Production was rushed and large sections of the film were scrapped after poorly received test screenings. New scenes were written and filmed during re-shoots between March and April 1989, only two months before its release.

&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was released on June 16, 1989, to generally negative reviews. Critics responded unfavorably to what they perceived as largely a copy of the original and a softening of its cynical, dark humor to be more family-friendly, although the performances of Peter MacNicol and Rick Moranis were repeatedly singled out for praise. As the sequel to the then-highest-grossing comedy film of all time, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was expected to dominate the box office. Instead, the film earned $215.4 million during its theatrical run compared with the original&#x27;s $282.2 million, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year. Columbia Pictures deemed it a financial and critical failure, effectively dissuading Murray from participating in a third &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; film. Its soundtrack single, &quot;On Our Own&quot; by Bobby Brown, was a success, spending 20 weeks on the United States music charts.

The film failed to replicate the cultural impact and following of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Although some critics retrospectively praised it, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; is generally seen as a poor follow-up to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and responsible for stalling the franchise for decades. The film spawned a series of merchandise including video games, board games, comic books, music, toys, and haunted houses. Despite the relative failure of &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot;, a second sequel was pursued through to the early 2010s. Following the mixed reviews and financial underperformance of the 2016 series reboot, the series returned to the original films with &quot;&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024).

== Plot ==
Five years after saving New York City from destruction by the shapeshifting god Gozer, the Ghostbusters have been sued for the property damage incurred and barred from investigating the supernatural, forcing them out of business. Ray Stantz now owns an occult bookstore and works a side job alongside Winston Zeddemore as unpopular children&#x27;s entertainers; Egon Spengler works in a laboratory experimenting with human emotions; and Peter Venkman hosts a television talk show about psychics.

Dana Barrett, Peter&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, has an infant son named Oscar with her ex-husband and works at an art museum restoring artwork. She contacts the Ghostbusters after Oscar&#x27;s baby stroller rolls, seemingly independently, into a busy intersection. At the museum, a painting of Vigo the Carpathian, a 16th-century European tyrant and powerful magician, comes to life and enslaves Dana&#x27;s boss, Janosz Poha. Vigo orders Janosz to bring him a child to possess, allowing him to escape the confines of his painting and live again to conquer the world. Because of his infatuation with Dana, Janosz chooses Oscar.

Meanwhile, the Ghostbusters excavate the intersection where Oscar&#x27;s stroller stopped and discover a river of slime running through the abandoned Beach Pneumatic Transit system. Ray obtains a sample but is attacked by the slime and accidentally breaks a pipe that falls onto a power line, causing a citywide blackout. The Ghostbusters are arrested and taken to court for the damage and for investigating the supernatural. Upon presentation as evidence, the slime sample responds physically to the judge&#x27;s tirade against the Ghostbusters and then explodes, manifesting the ghosts of the Scoleri brothers, whom he had sentenced to death. The Ghostbusters capture the ghosts in exchange for a dismissal of the charges and the right to resume their business.

One night, the slime invades Dana&#x27;s apartment, attacking her and Oscar. She seeks refuge with Peter, and they rekindle their relationship. The Ghostbusters discover the slime reacts to emotions and suspect it has amassed from the negative emotions of New Yorkers. Determining Vigo and the slime are connected, Egon, Ray, and Winston investigate the river of slime, but they are pulled in. They emerge at the museum and begin fighting each other until Egon realizes the slime&#x27;s negative energy is influencing them. The Ghostbusters tell the mayor of their discoveries but are dismissed; his assistant Jack Hardemeyer has them committed to a psychiatric hospital to protect the mayor&#x27;s political interests. A spirit appearing as Janosz kidnaps Oscar, and Dana pursues them into the museum, which is then covered with impenetrable slime.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve, the slime rises to the streets, causing widespread supernatural chaos. Discovering Hardemeyer&#x27;s actions, the enraged mayor fires him and has the Ghostbusters released. Determining that a positive symbol will rally the citizens and weaken the slime, the Ghostbusters use slime charged with positive emotions to animate and pilot the Statue of Liberty through the streets filled with cheering citizens. At the museum, the slime barrier partially recedes due to the positive emotions. The Ghostbusters use the Statue&#x27;s torch to break through the ceiling, stopping Vigo from possessing Oscar, then rappel through the ceiling and neutralize Janosz with positive slime. Vigo takes on a physical form, immobilizes Dana and the Ghostbusters, and recaptures Oscar. The gathered crowds outside begin singing a chorus of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, and their positivity weakens Vigo, sending him back to the painting and freeing the Ghostbusters. Vigo possesses Ray, but the Ghostbusters use their weapons to free him and defeat Vigo, his painting being replaced by one depicting their likenesses surrounding Oscar. Afterwards, the city lauds the Ghostbusters and the Statue of Liberty is returned to Liberty Island.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
After the success of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, a sequel was considered inevitable even though the film had been developed as a stand-alone project. The development of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was arduous, and the behind-the-scenes conflicts were given as much coverage in the press as the film. When David Puttnam became chairman of Columbia Pictures in June 1986, he was not interested in developing an expensive sequel, and favored smaller films such as the critically acclaimed war film &quot;Hope and Glory&quot; (1987) and the comedy film &quot;Bloodhounds of Broadway&quot; (1989) over big-budget blockbusters. He also greenlit several foreign-language films by European directors because he preferred making films for the &quot;world market&quot;. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was part of former Columbia executive Frank Price&#x27;s legacy, and Puttnam had no interest in furthering that legacy while building his own.

Reitman later said the delay in development was not Puttnam&#x27;s fault; he said that executives above Puttnam at Columbia&#x27;s New York branch had attempted to work around him, but could not get the production moving even after sidelining him. According to Reitman, the delay occurred because the main actors did not want to make a sequel for nearly three years; by the time they decided to go ahead, Murray was committed to his starring role in the Christmas comedy film &quot;Scrooged&quot; (1988). When Murray was finally ready, the script was not. As co-creators, Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis all had control over the franchise, and their unanimous approval was required to proceed.

In April 1987, Puttnam announced that &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; would go into production in November that year without having informed Reitman, who had not yet reviewed the unfinished script. Puttnam was removed from his job in September. This was in part because he had alienated Murray and his talent agent Michael Ovitz. Puttnam had publicly criticized Murray as &quot;an actor who makes millions of dollars from Hollywood without giving back to his art. He&#x27;s a taker&quot;. He also attacked expensive talent agency packages that provided scripts, directors, and stars; Ovitz also represented Aykroyd, Ramis, and Reitman.

Puttnam was replaced as Columbia president by Dawn Steel. When she took the job, her corporate bosses made it clear that getting the sequel into production was a priority. Columbia had experienced a long series of box-office failures since &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was seen as the best way to reverse their fortunes. By November, filming was scheduled to begin in summer the following year. At the time, Murray reportedly wanted $10 million to star in the sequel and his co-stars demanded an equal amount.

The main obstacle was the disputes between the principal cast and crew that had arisen since &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Ramis later said &quot;there was a little air to clear&quot; before they could work together. In March 1988, Ovitz arranged a private lunch for himself, Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Reitman, and Ovitz&#x27;s colleague, CAA head of business affairs Ray Kurtzman, at Jimmy&#x27;s, a celebrity restaurant in Beverly Hills, California. Concerns were raised such as whether the principals could still carry the sequel because Murray had been away from films for so long and Aykroyd had had a series of film failures. During the meeting, the group had fun and decided they could work together.

Months of negotiations followed with Reitman, Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis to negotiate a minimal salary in exchange for a percentage of the box office profits. The deal was reported to be 10% of the box office profits each; Reitman denied that the figure was that large but said, &quot;it&#x27;s a big one&quot;. This was to keep the budget low, aiming for approximately $30 million, whereas upfront salaries would have raised it closer to $50 million. After this, the film was rushed into production, with shooting scheduled for mid-1988 in anticipation of a mid-1989 release. Despite the five years it took to produce a sequel and its necessity for special effects, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; had a shorter schedule than its predecessor&#x27;s one-year turnaround. Michael C. Gross and producer Joe Medjuck returned for the sequel, each promoted to producer. Michael Chapman replaced László Kovács as cinematographer, and Bo Welch replaced John DeCuir as production designer.

=== Writing ===

Aykroyd described his first draft as &quot;really too far out...too inaccessible&quot;. He wanted to avoid using New York City, set the film overseas, and provide a contrast to the first film&#x27;s climax atop a skyscraper by including a subterranean threat. This draft followed Dana Barrett, who is kidnapped and taken to Scotland, where she discovers a fairy ring—a naturally occurring ring or arc of mushrooms sometimes linked in folklore to fairies or witches—and an underground civilization. The Ghostbusters would have had to travel through an underground pneumatic tube over 2,000 miles long that would have taken three days to traverse. He eventually decided that retaining the New York setting would allow for continuity and would better fit the story he wanted to tell while allowing them to explore underground.

As with &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Aykroyd partnered with Ramis to refine the script. Early on, they decided &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; should reflect the five-year passage of time between the two films. Ramis suggested the story focus on a baby because he had previously developed a horror film concept centered on an infant who possessed adult agility and focus. This inspired him to create the character Oscar. Initially, the child was the son of Peter Venkman and Dana, who would have maintained their relationship in the intervening years. The child would have become possessed as a focal point of the film; Murray felt this created an imbalance in the story, placing too much emphasis on his and Dana&#x27;s relationship with the child rather than the Ghostbusters and their character dynamics. Instead, they chose to have Peter&#x27;s and Dana&#x27;s relationship fail, allowing her to marry, have a child and be divorced by the events of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;. Ramis wanted to show that the Ghostbusters had not remained heroes after their victory in the previous film; he felt that would have been a less original approach.

The river of slime was conceived early in their collaboration. Ramis wanted the slime beneath New York to present a moral issue caused by the buildup of negative human emotions in large cities; he considered it a metaphor for urban decay and a call to deliver a human solution, though he said this was buried deeply in the script. The pair wanted negative emotions to have consequences and found humor in New York City having to be nice or face destruction, though at this point they did not know what form that destruction would take. Ramis said: &quot;Comedically, it suggested, what if everyone in New York City had to be nice for forty-eight hours?&quot; Aykroyd said they wanted to show negativity has to go somewhere, potentially into the person the emotion is directed towards. He felt this made the film more grounded compared with dealings with gods. He said: &quot;Cities everywhere are dangerous. Life has become cheap. You can go to... see a movie and get machine-gunned on the street&quot;. The story evolved far from Ramis&#x27; and Aykroyd&#x27;s efforts but retained the core notion of emotions and their impact. By May 1987, Aykroyd and Ramis had been working for over a year, and had completed the screenplay by March 1988.

In the years since the release of the more adult-oriented &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, its animated spin-off television series &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; had become popular with its target child audience. The team was tasked with balancing the needs of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; fans and those of the cartoon&#x27;s audience. According to Medjuck, the cartoon&#x27;s success was influential in the return of Slimer for the sequel, and they aimed to avoid contradicting the cartoon where possible; he said although the Ghostbusters have been out of work for five years, they had to act as though the cartoon&#x27;s events took place after the film.

=== Casting ===

According to early reports, Puttnam intended to replace the principal cast with lower-salaried actors, in part because of his disdain for Murray. Puttnam denied this in a 1987 interview and said recasting had never been an option.

&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was to be the first sequel Reitman had directed, and he was worried about being able to surprise the audience without relying on elaborate special effects. He wanted to focus on character interaction, believing that was the original film&#x27;s main draw. Ramis was apprehensive about returning to the franchise because of the overwhelming success of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Murray was also hesitant; he had left acting for four years following the release of the previous film. He described &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ success as a phenomenon that would forever be his biggest accomplishment and felt &quot;radioactive&quot; after the failure of his personal project &quot;The Razor&#x27;s Edge&quot; (1984). He chose to avoid making films until he returned for &quot;Scrooged&quot;. Murray was also dismissive of sequels in general, believing they exist only for &quot;greed&quot; or &quot;business&quot; reasons, the latter of which he said should carry a death sentence. He said he returned for the sequel because &quot;working on the first &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was the most fun any of us had&quot;.

The character of Janosz Poha, portrayed by Peter MacNicol, was originally called Jason and serves as a straight man to the Ghostbusters. MacNicol said the role could be played by anyone so he opted to give Poha a backstory in which he is Carpathian. He developed the accent from his Czech friend and from observations at a Romanian tourist agency. MacNicol wanted to wear a black Beatles wig but the idea was rejected because many of the cast had dark hair. The character&#x27;s accent was inspired by that of Meryl Streep in the film &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot; (1982). In the script, Poha is not described as having an accent but MacNicol impressed Reitman with it at his audition.

Max von Sydow provided the voice of Vigo; he completed his recordings in a single day. Von Homburg reportedly only learned his voice had been dubbed with von Sydow&#x27;s while watching the premiere and stormed out shortly afterward. He later said his slurred voice, which was caused by a split lip, had been a hindrance in securing acting work. Eugene Levy was cast as Louis&#x27; cousin Sherman, an employee at the psychiatric ward where the Ghostbusters are imprisoned. The character was instrumental in their liberation but his scenes were cut.

Reitman began working on &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; almost immediately after directing the 1988 comedy film &quot;Twins&quot;. Principal photography began in November 1988, in New York City. The budget was reported to be between $30 million and $40 million. Filming in New York lasted approximately two weeks and consisted mostly of exterior shoots.

The city authorities were supportive of the project and even granted the crew permission to film on Manhattan&#x27;s Second Avenue during a period in which access for forty city blocks was restricted because of the visit of Mikhail Gorbachev, leader of the Soviet Union. Other locations include the Statue of Liberty and Firehouse, Hook &amp; Ladder Company 8, the latter of which again served as the exterior of the Ghostbusters&#x27; headquarters. The updated Ghostbusters&#x27; business logo, which was gifted to the firehouse staff after filming, was hung on the outside of the building but eventually fell off.

The Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House served as the exterior of the Manhattan Museum of Art, which housed the Vigo painting. The scene of Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson&#x27;s characters emerging from a manhole covered in slime was filmed in front of the building. When he wrote the scene, Ramis expected the production to use a manhole, but the only available underground location was a telephone conduit. Space in the hole was limited, and the actors had to squeeze into it while covered in slime. Freezing temperatures combined with the liquid slime made the actors uncomfortable. The following day, they learned the cameras had been recording at the wrong speed and they would have to film the scene again. The scene of the Ghostbusters scanning the intersection where Oscar&#x27;s possessed baby carriage is taken was filmed on First Avenue.

Filming had moved to Los Angeles by late December 1988. Fire Station No. 23 again served as the interior of the Ghostbusters&#x27; headquarters. Greystone Mansion in Beverly Hills was used for the scene in which the Ghostbusters visit the mayor at Gracie Mansion. The scene in which the Ghostbusters dig a hole to find the river of slime was filmed in downtown Los Angeles. The scene in which a fur coat comes to life and runs away was filmed on a Los Angeles street; it was written for the original film but was not used and repurposed for &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;. Filming concluded on March 7, 1989. Medjuck noted that characters are often seen smoking in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; but a societal change in the intervening years meant this was no longer acceptable; &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; depicts fewer scenes including smoking.

=== Post-production ===

Following test screenings, the principal crew realized there were numerous issues with the film. Reitman said that upon watching the test version he realized the final 25 minutes of the film &quot;just died a horrible death&quot;, so he spent four days filming a new 25-minute ending to replace it. The test screenings identified that audiences liked the film but felt Vigo did not present a real challenge to the Ghostbusters and that their victory was too easy. Test audiences also thought Vigo, the slime, and the associated ghosts were not sufficiently connected. According to Gross, the audiences were not aware that the slime in the film could be charged by negative or positive emotions, so scenes were added to better explain this.

Extensive re-shoots were conducted throughout March and April 1989, only two months before the film&#x27;s release; these included on-location filming in New York. &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; had been scheduled for release on the July 4th Independence Day holiday weekend but Reitman felt June 23 would work better. When they learned the superhero film &quot;Batman&quot; was also being released that day, they asked to move to the 16th. According to Gross, &quot;Joe Medjuck and I were turning pale... it did not look possible... It was a real killer&quot;.

Several new scenes were added to increase the sense of urgency and threat to the Ghostbusters, including the underground ghost train sequence and the associated severed-heads scare. A scene showing the Ghostbusters&#x27; developed photographs of Vigo bursting into flames, threatening to immolate them, was also added. Reitman wanted these scenes added because he thought his previous cut of the film focused too much on the relationship between Murray&#x27;s and Weaver&#x27;s characters. The ghost train scene was filmed at the Tunnel night club in New York. It was added to create a sense of an unseen force trying to keep the Ghostbusters away. Medjuck noted that the added scenes did not require extensive special effects. Cheech Marin&#x27;s cameo as a dock supervisor was also added in this period.

The additional content replaced some scenes and subplots that were far into completion and contained finished special effects. Further shooting was done in Washington Square Park, which was used for the monster moving under the Washington Square Arch. The popularity of the film was evident at that time when thousands of people arrived after hearing &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was being filmed there. They took part in filming, screaming on cue and running to escape the monster. The film&#x27;s final battle with Vigo was reshot, and the way that Vigo left the painting to confront the Ghostbusters changed completely.

One of the cut scenes included a subplot in which the Ray Stantz character is possessed by Vigo following his inspection of the Vigo painting. Ray erratically drives the Ectomobile until he is freed of Vigo&#x27;s control by Winston. This explained Ray&#x27;s possession in the finale. Some of this footage was repurposed into a montage. There were also scenes of Louis Tully attempting to capture Slimer, which test audiences found intrusive, and Slimer was reduced to two appearances. Gross said they retained some Slimer scenes for children but that audiences generally had no reaction to the character, which was not what they had expected. Because the sequence in which Tully&#x27;s cousin frees the Ghostbusters from the psychiatric hospital was removed, a scene showing a paranormal eclipse from the Mayor&#x27;s office was added to explain the Mayor securing their release. Other removed scenes showed Ray and Egon experimenting with the slime, which explained how they learned to manipulate it to control the Statue of Liberty. A ghost was also removed from the sequence in which the slime causes ghosts to rise across New York because Reitman felt it was not creepy enough.

=== Music ===

Ray Parker Jr. helped develop an updated version of his hit song &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, which was co-written and performed by hip hop group Run-DMC. Aiming to replicate the success of the original soundtrack, producer Peter Afterman wanted to hire Bobby Brown who had a recent succession of hit songs. To secure Brown&#x27;s involvement, Afterman offered Brown&#x27;s music label, MCA Records, the rights to the &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; soundtrack. Brown agreed in exchange for a role in the film. Filming had nearly concluded at that time, but Reitman wrote Brown a cameo as the mayor&#x27;s doorman. The resulting song, &quot;On Our Own&quot;, was written by L.A. Reid, Babyface, and Daryl Simmons. The music video features appearances by Iman, Jane Curtin, Doug E. Fresh, Christopher Reeve, Malcolm Forbes, Rick Moranis, Donald Trump, and Marky and Joey Ramone.

Brown also worked alone to write and produce &quot;We&#x27;re Back&quot;. Other songs on the soundtrack include &quot;Flip City&quot; by Glenn Frey, &quot;Spirit&quot; by Doug E. Fresh &amp; The Get Fresh Crew, and &quot;Love is a Cannibal&quot; by Elton John. The song &quot;Flesh &#x27;n Blood&quot; by composer Danny Elfman and Oingo Boingo was written for the film but Elfman said he was disappointed that only four musical bars of it were used. He thought the small usage was an excuse to be able to release it on the soundtrack and said if he had known he would have pulled the song.

Randy Edelman was responsible for the film&#x27;s original score. It was one of Edelman&#x27;s first experiences working with a large scale orchestra. Although familiar with &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, he chose not to re-watch it for inspiration so the sequel would have a unique sound. Edelman believed the distinct personalities of the existing characters meant they rarely needed a musical accompaniment, and instead focused on scoring the supernatural and action setpieces to represent the menace and &quot;dark nature of the evil Carpathian&quot;.

== Special effects and design ==

As with his work on &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, Reitman had little interest in the technical side of his film. For the sequel, he employed special effects studio Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), giving them a rough outline of the plot and the freedom to do as they wanted. Columbia had previously helped Richard Edlund found special effects company &quot;Boss Film Studios&quot; for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, but Reitman was reported to be unhappy with their work. Edlund&#x27;s former ILM co-worker Dennis Muren served as the visual effects supervisor. Despite the film&#x27;s intentionally rushed schedule, Muren wanted to work on the film because it would let him design new creatures. Muren admitted that his designs would not be as original as &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″, and instead wanted to make them more flexible and &quot;ghostly&quot;. The team was originally hired to provide 110 effects shots but this grew to 180.

ILM was also working on special effects for other 1989 releases; &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, and &quot;The Abyss&quot;, but had the most difficulty with &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; because designs and concepts were constantly changing and new scenes were being added. ILM eventually refused to accept any further alterations. As the schedule tightened, ILM had nine teams working every day for four weeks to complete the expanded 180 shots, and had to outsource some of the extra work to Visual Concept Engineering, Available Light, Character Shop, and the uncredited Tippett Studio. Apogee Productions handled many of the effects for the reshoots.

=== Slime ===
Methocel, a vegetable-based gel, was used to create the slime. Food coloring was added; the colors included green (to match Slimer) and blue. Physical effects supervisor Chuck Gaspar mocked up differently colored batches, and Reitman settled on pink. The film required approximately of slime. Four cement mixers were kept on-site to mix fresh batches daily because it deteriorated quickly. Mica dust and mineral oil were added for the river of slime; the dust added depth to the river while the oil created varying shapes on its surface.

The river of slime in the Van Horne Pneumatic Transit station was a miniature model with a plexiglass trough wide and long. It operated in a gravity pump and was fed from a large tank above it. After reaching the end of the river, the slime fell into another tank, from which it was fed back to the upper tank. Air injectors and puppeteered baffles were used to create bubbles and manipulate the slime to flow as though something was moving beneath the surface. Small slime tentacles were created using vinyl-covered sticks operated from below. The large tentacle was plastic and was filmed against a blue screen as it fell away from a stand-in&#x27;s boot. The footage was then played in reverse so the tentacle would appear to be grabbing at Aykroyd. The Van Horne scene combined the miniature river, matte paintings of the station, and a practical set for stairs leading to a tunnel. The scene in which Aykroyd, Ramis, and Hudson fall into the river was considered one of the most difficult effects to achieve; the actors were filmed falling from the Van Horne set, which was composited with the miniature river. Hudson&#x27;s character being dragged away by the slime&#x27;s current was filmed against a blue screen so he would appear in the river; his motion in the river had to be animated by hand against the river&#x27;s natural movements.

=== Creature effects ===
The returning Slimer ghost was redeveloped to be more child-friendly like his popular &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; incarnation. His face, which was controlled with wires and cables in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, was now controlled by servo motors and had a pneumatic jaw. Bobby Porter was hired to wear the Slimer costume until the character was removed from the film entirely. A few weeks later, Slimer was reinserted, but by this time, Porter was not available and was replaced by Robin Shelby.

The Scoleri Brother ghosts, Tony and Nunzio, were inspired by a pair of brothers who robbed Ramis&#x27; father&#x27;s store. Creature designer Tim Lawrence was influenced by the musical comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), which starred Aykroyd and featured two brothers, one of whom was tall and thin (Tony) and the other short and fat (Nunzio). The brothers were given a cartoonish design to counter the film&#x27;s scary moments. Lawrence aimed to represent the characters&#x27; evil rather than their pre-death appearances. Camilla Henneman created most of Nunzio using spandex pouches filled with gelatinous materials to make him appear impossibly fat. The costume was worn by Lawrence. The impossibly thin Tony was designed as a life-size puppet but Muren thought this approach would impact the filming schedule. Tony was reworked as a costume that was worn by actor Jim Fye; it was given elongated appendages to appear unnaturally thin.

The ghosts&#x27; faces were articulated with motors and pneumatics created by mechanical animator Al Coulter and his team. Lawrence also developed an animation system to allow the masks to lip-sync dialog. Alongside early concepts of the ghosts walking and creating explosive ruptures with each step, most of these features were abandoned in the final film. Lawrence later said without those features the same effect could have been created with a one-third-scale puppet. The brothers&#x27; electric chairs were miniatures composited into footage of the seated, costumed actors. Distortion effects such as the ghosts being squeezed were created using completed effect shots that were rephotographed through mylar material that could be warped to affect the underlying image. For the scene in which Nunzio carries the prosecutor upside-down from the courtroom, a stuntwoman was hung upside down on a rail. Reitman wanted her to pass through the doorway while seeing above it. Gaspar&#x27;s team created a passage made of foam above a door that resembled the iron grill. The foam was spring-loaded so that when the wire passed through, the set sprang back into place quickly; the effect was hidden behind a composite of Nunzio. Full-scale cutouts of the ghosts were used during filming to aid the actors. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; storyboard artist Thom Enriquez storyboarded the scene; he found the process difficult because the limited schedule meant the courtroom was being built as he worked. He was also restricted by the budget, saying he &quot;could use only fourteen chairs. I could also blow up four pillars and one wall of glass&quot;.
The animated Statue of Liberty was conceived by Aykroyd, who liked the idea of taking a static image and making it move about, comparing it with seeing the Eiffel Tower moving or Victoria Falls flowing in reverse. The statue&#x27;s role was originally written as a weapon for Vigo but this idea did not progress the narrative. The effect was a combination of a costume worn by Fye, miniatures, and larger-than-life-size elements like the statue&#x27;s crown— which in reality was too small to let the Ghostbusters peer out. The crown was mounted on a gimbal, allowing it to be pivoted as though its wearer was walking. Reitman ordered the crown be tilted down further than the actors were expecting to elicit from them a genuine reaction of surprise. The upper body was modeled and filmed at night in a makeshift pool to show it emerging from the ocean. Fye also portrayed the ghost of a Central Park jogger.

To portray the possessed Janosz illuminating a hallway with his eyes, MacNicol was filmed walking down a hallway, which was filmed again without lights and with Michael Chapman holding a light at the height of MacNicol&#x27;s head, while panning it from side-to-side. Several takes were done to cover MacNicol&#x27;s gaze. Animators added the beams emanating from Janosz, including particulate matter to enhance the realism. The &quot;ghost nanny&quot; version of Janosz that snatches Oscar from Venkman&#x27;s apartment went through many variations. During development, it was conceived of as a two-headed dragon—an idea that was dismissed as unoriginal—billboard figures, animated gargoyles, a phantom taxi, and Santa Claus. A possessed item in the apartment was also considered; this idea inspired the possessed bathtub. MacNicol wore drag as the nanny for closeups and a puppet was used for wide shots. The ghost&#x27;s extending arm was made from stretchable plastic tubing covered in fabric.

Welch built the exterior walls and ledge of Venkman&#x27;s apartment to scale; it was positioned in the air. The ledge was superimposed over a matte painting of the full building. The infant actor was secured in a rig that helped him to stand up before his abduction. The possessed bathtub started as a bubble-bath monster that would appear to have thousands of eyes in each bubble; it is destroyed when Dana drops her hairdryer into the bath. Reitman preferred the slime to be the monster. A silicone bath that could be easily bent was used; from below, Tom Floutz puppeteered a tentacle made of dielectric gel and reinforced with spandex and china silk, which was covered in slime. A fiberglass maw was inserted in front of a vacuum tube that sucked the material backward when activated, revealing a mouth. An animated tongue was added later.

The RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; was one of the first shots ILM completed; they wanted a powerful image for the scene and considered using the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; airship complete with flaming passengers and luggage, a subway train carrying rotting passengers, and a graveyard with exploding headstones. A miniature model of the &quot;Titanic&quot; with slightly modified aspects was used instead; the position of the ship&#x27;s name was altered to make it clearly identifiable. Extras were filmed wearing period costume, seaweed, and dripping water but many of the minor details were lost in the wide shot. A scale model of the museum was created because Reitman wanted to be able to show the slime oozing from cracks and seams. Several last-minute effect shots were added due to the hectic schedule. The ghost train was intended to be a subway car, but there was no time to find a suitable model, so an antique train was used. The severed heads were sourced from multiple places; poorer quality heads were placed further away from the camera. The theater ghost took three weeks to build and required four puppeteers. The Washington Square monster was animated in stop motion by Phil Tippett, who accepted the job on the condition that the effect was no longer than 160 frames, was built on an existing model, and could be done in one take. Tippett was seriously injured in a car accident during development but continued to work and finished his effect in time. The slime-possessed fur coat was achieved using four coats with parts controlled with servo motors. ILM considered using live animals for the segment but abandoned the idea.

=== Vigo the Carpathian ===

The concept for the physical form of the central villain Vigo went through many changes, including a plan to transform him into a large monstrosity. There was difficulty determining how Vigo would interact outside his painting. Vigo was intended to have heavier creature makeup, but after Von Homburg was cast, his distinctive look meant the extra makeup was largely unnecessary.

In early 1989, ILM contacted Glen Eytchison to develop a painting that could come to life. Eytchison specialized in &quot;tableaux vivants&quot; - the use of static sets and stationary actors to create the illusion of a flat painting. Muren said that his team could have worked out a way to achieve the desired effect, but they did not have enough time and needed to enlist an expert. The aim was to depict what appeared to be a painting of Vigo that would come to life to shock the audience. ILM spent months producing concepts of the painting&#x27;s look but Reitman rejected them for being too similar to &quot;Conan [the Barbarian]&quot;. Eytchison and his team researched the look of a 16th-century warlord and references the period&#x27;s painters to match the contemporaneous art styles.

Eytchison&#x27;s team painted a background and individual items including skies, skulls, and trees on acetate. This allowed Reitman to view combinations quickly; he chose his favored design in 15 minutes. Local painter Lou Police produced a painting from this concept; Reitman approved it but Eytchison realized a painting would not be realistic enough to allow them to switch between it and the actor. Eytchison&#x27;s team decided to create a small set resembling the painting; it had structural elements, including styrofoam skulls, in which Von Homburg could stand. Von Homburg&#x27;s costume and the set were painted by the same team to ensure they had the same texture and blended together.

Once the set arrived at ILM, Von Homburg was positioned in it wearing full costume, makeup, and prosthetics. Lighting was used to eliminate shadows, creating a flat image. A photograph was then taken and enlarged to be used as the painting. Welch&#x27;s department treated the photograph to make it closely resemble an oil painting. Scenes of Von Homburg on the set delivering his dialog and stepping out of the set as if leaving the painting were filmed; according to Eytchison, the actor struggled with the action and Reitman did not like the effect. The ending was changed completely, eliminating the living picture concept. When Vigo interacts from the painting in the finished film, the image is replaced by Von Homburg&#x27;s disembodied head floating over a miniature river-of-slime set built from foam by ILM. When leaving the painting, Vigo disappears and materializes into the scene. Another concept had him &quot;peel&quot; from the canvas, and another had the slime bring other paintings to life to aid him. A molded mask was created to represent his inner evil; it was worn by Harold Weed as the possessed version of Aykroyd&#x27;s character.

=== Technology ===

&quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ hardware consultant Stephen Dane was responsible for much of the Ghostbusters&#x27; equipment and their vehicle, the Ectomobile; he designed new equipment for &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; in an uncredited role. Dane revised the designs of the proton pack weapons, the ghost trap, and the Ectomobile, which became the Ectomobile 1A. Dane designed new equipment including the giga-meter, the slime scooper, and the slime blower—a large tank connected to a slime-spewing nozzle. He re-purposed leftover prop warning labels and symbols from his work on &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) to make the equipment look more authentic.

The slime blower weapons were three times heavier than the proton packs; the tanks did not contain slime, which was pumped through the guns from off-camera. The bulky proton packs, which were considered heavy and uncomfortable during the filming of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, were redesigned to weigh in comparison with the and versions used on the previous film. The new design offered more comfort while removing some of the powered effects. Muren&#x27;s team redesigned the proton pack neutrino wand beams to be multi-functional, allowing them to be used as lassos or fishing lines to capture ghosts instead of being straight beams. Five remotely controlled baby strollers were used to create the possessed stroller in the film&#x27;s opening; motors and driveshafts were concealed with the stroller&#x27;s chrome body, and brakes that could stop it immediately or slow it gradually were used. Gaspar employed two-time national miniature-car champion Jay Halsey to drive the stroller; he had to weave it between traffic from up to away.

== Release ==
=== Context ===

In 1989, more sequels were scheduled for release than in any previous year, including &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot;, &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;, and &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot;. Also released that year were original hits that would become popular classics like &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;; &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;; &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot;; and &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;. That year&#x27;s most anticipated film was &quot;Batman&quot;, which was scheduled for release a week after &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;, and whose logo had become ubiquitous through a significant marketing campaign coordinated by Warner Bros. Shortly before its release, a &quot;major theater chain&quot; executive said they expected &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; to make approximately $150 million during its run, behind &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; ($225 million) and &quot;Batman&quot; ($175 million), and ahead of &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; ($100 million).

&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was originally scheduled for release in July 1989 but less than three months before release, it was brought forward to June to avoid direct competition with &quot;Batman&quot;. The premiere of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; took place on June 15, 1989, at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater, with an after-party that required payment to attend at the Hollywood Palladium; the entrance fees collected were donated to Saint John&#x27;s Health Center.

=== Box office ===
&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; received a wide release on June 16, 1989, in 2,410 theaters, compared with the original film&#x27;s opening on 1,339. Compared to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ $13million opening weekend, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; film earned $29.5million—an average of $12,229 per theater—as the number one film of the weekend, ahead of the action-adventure film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; ($11.7million) which was in its fourth week of release and drama film &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; ($9.1million), which was in its third. Based on its gross and an average increase in ticket price of 22% since &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ release, an estimated 2million more people went to see the film&#x27;s opening. It broke the all-time record for a one-day opening with approximately $10million on its opening Friday; it was also the biggest non-holiday opening weekend with $29.5million, narrowly beating &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;″s opening three-day gross of $29.4million.

&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; revenue was exceeded the following weekend by &quot;Batman&quot;″s $15.6million opening day takings, and $43.6million opening weekend earnings earned from 2,194 theaters. &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; earned another $13.8million—a 53% drop from the previous weekend—bringing its 10-day total to $58.8million, putting it in third place behind &quot;Batman&quot; and another new release, the Moranis-starring comedy film &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; ($14.3million), which was bolstered by a heavily marketed seven-minute &quot;Roger Rabbit short&quot; film playing before it. This weekend gross saw &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; contribute to the highest-grossing weekend ever at the time, with total box office takings of $92million across all theaters.

Compared to the original &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ seven-week run at number one, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; never regained the top slot, falling to number four in its third week behind the debuting drama &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot;, and to number 5 in its fourth week behind the action film &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; and black comedy &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot;, both of which were new releases. &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; left the top-ten-grossing films by its seventh week and was removed from cinemas entirely by late-September after fifteen weeks. In total, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; earned $112.5million in North America, less than half that of the original&#x27;s revenue, making it the seventh-highest-grossing film of the year, behind &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; ($118.4million), &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; ($147.3million), &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; ($130.7million), &quot;Look Who&#x27;s Talking&quot; ($140.1million), and the highest domestic grossing film of that year, &quot;Batman&quot; ($251.2million).

Outside North America, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; is estimated to have earned approximately $102.9million, nearly doubling the original&#x27;s overseas takings and raising its worldwide total to $215.4million. This figure makes it the eighth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1989, falling approximately $67million short of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;″ original theatrical revenue.

=== Critical response ===

&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. Audiences responded more positively; CinemaScore polls reported that moviegoers gave an average rating of &quot;A−&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Dave Kehr and &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Mike Clark were critical of attempts at making the Ghostbusters more mature which made the film feel &quot;tired&quot; and lacking in surprises. They said that &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had succeeded by projecting childlike fantasies onto adult characters who snubbed authority and bonded in a clubhouse, but by taking a surreal comedic fantasy and adding humanity to the central characters, the sequel had become &quot;Four Ghostbusters and a Baby&quot;, a reference to the 1987 comedy film &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;. Roger Ebert called it a disappointment, saying he reviewed &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; in a public screening and heard only one laugh during the entire film.

Several reviewers criticized the film for too closely emulating the structure and story elements of its predecessor. Gene Siskel called it a poor copy that offered nothing new, as though they &quot;were filming the first draft of a script&quot;. Richard Schickel was critical of the glut of sequels in 1989 in his review. He said that &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; offered only slight variations over the original without further developing the characters, and had a &quot;shamelessly&quot; similar ending. &quot;Time Out&quot; echoed sentiments that the film largely retraced the events of its predecessor, and the addition of an infant came across as a convenience. Desson Thomson said &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; felt like an extended version of its predecessor without as many impressive special effects. Writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, William Thomas said the script was sharp but certainly aimed towards entertaining younger audience members.

Sheila Benson praised the film and said its denouement was superior to that of the original. She appreciated that despite being a sequel, it did not rely on inside jokes that might alienate audiences and that the interplay between the actors felt inclusive. Hal Hinson said that while &quot;big and dumb and clunky&quot; like the first film, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; offered more personality. Hinson considered sequels to be generally lazy and reliant on the success of the previous film, but felt that &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; looked better and was confident enough to experiment with the source material. He nevertheless criticized it for what he saw as a lack of tension and plot development. Vincent Canby said the film was funnier and not as &quot;oppressively extravagant&quot; as &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;; he believed the plot lacked depth but that the overall tone of the film was &quot;remarkably cheerful&quot;.

Some reviewers found the film to be poorly paced, leaving scenes feeling overlong, and that its best moments felt both few and infrequent. Others echoed this sentiment, saying that it lacked the energy of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and was too laid back. Writing for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Rick Groen considered the film self-important and mediocre, and criticized Reitman&#x27;s direction for lacking visual imagination. The film&#x27;s special effects generally received praise. Benson called them &quot;impressive&quot;, and Caroll highlighted moments like the ghostly, resurrected &quot;Titanic&quot;, but she felt that the creatures lacked any real menace. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film&#x27;s slime and visuals would appeal to children, while adults could appreciate the witty dialogue.

Unlike &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, reviewers were more conflicted over Murray&#x27;s performance in the sequel. Kehr said that his performance retained &quot;bright&quot; moments, but he seemed less energetic than in his previous film &quot;Scrooged&quot;. Rosenbaum concurred, stating that the actor&#x27;s trademark comedic indifference seemed to be lacking commitment, and Caroll said that his well-received performance in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had been replaced by a &quot;smug swagger and constant smirking&quot; that she found irritating. &quot;Variety&quot; considered his character is central to the film because of his ad-libbed dialog, and Groen argued that Murray essentially carried the film alone. Hinson said that Murray&#x27;s comedic performance was vital to tempering the film from becoming over-sentimental when discussing battling negativity with positivity.

Thomas claimed that the previous film had allowed Murray&#x27;s character to be aloof, selfish, and immature, while &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; pushed him towards being in a mature relationship and demonstrating genuine human warmth, which he felt did not work. Benson commented that Murray&#x27;s and Weaver&#x27;s characters felt unconnected and more like rivals than lovers. Thomas and Siskel said that the film&#x27;s emphasis on this romantic subplot was to its detriment, both occupying too much of its runtime and largely removing Murray from the action scenes. Clark lamented that Weaver was underutilized in a stereotypical working mother role.

MacNicol&#x27;s performance was consistently praised. Groen, who was critical of much of the cast for lackluster performances, said that his &quot;wickedly funny&quot; performance was the film&#x27;s sole surprising feature. Canby and Kehr concurred on MacNicol being a highlight of the film, Thomas saying that his character would be impersonated by children everywhere. Carroll called it a &quot;deliriously over-the-top performance&quot;. Moranis was also singled out for his comedic performance. Kehr and Clark appreciated the &quot;rewarding&quot; romantic subplot between his character and Potts&#x27;. Thomson said that the film&#x27;s best moments, provided by Murray, Moranis, and Aykroyd, were too few, which left him wanting more.

=== Performance analysis and aftermath ===

Financially, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was a relative success but it failed to meet studio expectations as a sequel to the highest-grossing comedy of all time. Despite being predicted to outperform its rival films before its release it failed to do so. As a part of the most successful summer for film to that date, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was seen as a critical and commercial failure; it also failed to garner the same passionate response from critics and fans as its predecessor. While Columbia did not comment, industry experts believed the film was undone, at least partly, by the combination of &quot;Batman&quot; attracting teenage audiences and &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; taking family audiences. Another issue was the quantity of films being released close together and unexpected successes that meant films were staying in theaters longer than anticipated. By only mid-July, one theater was alternating &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; and &quot;The Karate Kid III&quot; on the same screen because of their diminishing returns to play &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Lethal Weapon 2&quot; on other screens.

Reitman blamed changes in what audiences wanted from films. He felt contemporaneous society was more negative and cynical, and noted the popularity of &quot;Batman&quot;, which had a darker tone whereas &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; is more positive, particularly its upbeat, optimistic ending that shows New Yorkers coming together to help defeat Vigo. Reitman also felt the novelty of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; could not be repeated because big surprises like ghosts and epic finales were now expected. In 2014, he said that &quot;it didn&#x27;t all come together... we just sort of got off on the wrong foot story-wise on that film&quot;. Reviewers often noted that the film largely resembles its predecessor down to the story structure, a giant figure stomping through New York, and a mid-film montage set to a theme song. Some noted that releasing a film set at Christmas in June may also have worked against it. It has been suggested the five-year gap between films worked against it, both losing the momentum generated by the original and setting expectations too high. This period also allowed a potential cultural saturation of the brand through the cartoon series and merchandise.

Reitman was disappointed with &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; performance and said making the film had not been as much fun an experience as working on &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. He told Columbia he would not be part of a third film, and intended to break from comedies altogether. In a 2008 interview, Murray said: &quot;We did a sequel and it was sort of rather unsatisfying for me, because the first one to me was... the real thing... They&#x27;d written a whole different movie than the one [initially discussed]. And the special-effects guys got it... There were a few great scenes in it, but it wasn&#x27;t the same movie&quot;. Moranis said: &quot;To have something as offbeat, unusual, and unpredictable [as] the first &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, it&#x27;s next to impossible to create something better. [And] with sequels... they want better&quot;. Much as with the first film, Hudson was disappointed his role was relatively small. In &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, many of his major scenes had been given to Murray who was better-known, and Hudson felt the sequel continued to marginalize his character. He affirmed that despite this, he appreciated the role because of the positive way fans have reacted to it.

=== Home media ===
&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was released on VHS on November 22, 1989, only shortly after the end of its theatrical run. Since the early 1980s, home media was normally released at least six months after films launched in theaters, and in the case of blockbusters like &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot;, anywhere from nine to twelve months later. To take advantage of the Christmas season, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, and &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; were all released before the end of the year. The &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; VHS was priced at $90 and aimed towards rentals rather than individual purchases. The film entered the rental chart at number 10 and by late December it peaked as the second top VHS rental behind &quot;Batman&quot;. The home video release was controversial because the letterboxed versions reformatted the film to a less wide 1.66:1 aspect ratio, resulting in much of the original 2.35:1 picture being cropped out despite the use of black bars on the screen. A DVD version was released in 1999.

Blu-ray disc editions were released to celebrate the film&#x27;s 25th and 30th anniversaries in 2014 and 2019 respectively; the film was remastered and the releases feature 4K resolution video, deleted scenes, alternate takes, and an interview with Aykroyd and Reitman. The 30th-anniversary version was packaged in a limited-edition steel book cover, and also included &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and commentary by Reitman, Aykroyd, and producer Joe Medjuck. The film was released as part of the 8-disc &quot;Ghostbusters: Ultimate Collection&quot; Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray boxset in February 2022, alongside &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and its second sequel &quot;&quot; (2021), and the 2016 reboot &quot;&quot;. Presented in a ghost trap-shaped box, the release features unreleased deleted scenes from &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; and an edited-for-TV version including alternate scenes and takes.

The original soundtrack of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was first released on compact disc in 1989, peaking at number fourteen on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; music chart. Brown&#x27;s song &quot;On Our Own&quot; was a number-one song on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs music chart for one week in early August before being replaced by &quot;Batman&quot;″s own hit song &quot;Batdance&quot; by Prince. &quot;On Our Own&quot; peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, again behind &quot;Batdance&quot;, and later behind &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; by Richard Marx. &quot;On Our Own&quot; spent 20 weeks on the chart. The Run-DMC version of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; failed to develop the same level of enduring fandom as Parker, Jr.&#x27;s original. In 2014, the Run-DMC version was released on a special-edition, white vinyl record that was presented in a marshmallow-scented jacket. The record also contains the Parker, Jr. version of the song and was released to celebrate the 30th and 25th anniversaries of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; respectively. The same year, the soundtrack was first released in digital format. Edelman&#x27;s score remained unreleased until 2021. Available on vinyl, compact disc, and digital formats, the release included 16 tracks from the film, some of which were re-recorded for the album, and an unused song made for the film.

== Thematic analysis ==
=== Positivity vs. negativity ===
Several elements of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; deal with the consequences of actions. Instead of being lauded as heroes after defeating Gozer, the Ghostbusters are driven out of business because of the associated destruction they caused. The slime amasses beneath the city as a consequence of negative emotions projected by New Yorkers. When writing the script, Aykroyd and Ramis wanted to show that negativity had a lasting impact on the person inflicting it or the one receiving it. Aykroyd noted that, at the time, he considered major cities to be places where danger was rife and life held little value. Writing for &quot;Mashable&quot; in 2019, Pravit Chatterjee argues that this theme is more relevant in the contemporary age of social media and hate speech.

Similarly, positivity is presented as a uniquely powerful force. Their previous combined efforts defeated Gozer, a god of destruction, but the Ghostbusters are completely powerless against Vigo and the accumulated negativity fuelling him. It is only when the citizens gathered outside the museum unite to sing a chorus of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; that their positivity overwhelms Vigo, allowing the Ghostbusters to defeat him. In 2016, A. Bowdoin van Riper wrote that while destruction-heavy films set in New York made before the September 11 terrorist attack had taken on darker, unintended meanings, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; was now more relevant. Its ending, which can be seen as &quot;hokey&quot; or false, now seemed &quot;touchingly real&quot;. Murray described it as a &quot;story about innocence restored, and good values, and the power of faith in ordinary people&quot;. Unlike &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; lauds the values of community and family over their Ghostbusters&#x27; personal successes. Indeed, the Ghostbusters&#x27; involvement in the sequel comes from the threat to their personal acquaintance Dana Barrett and her son. They are drawn out of retirement and break the rules of their legal settlement with the city to help, despite the lack of financial rewards and the personal risk to themselves.

=== Fatherhood ===
&quot;GhostbustersII&quot; is among many films released during the 1980s and 1990s that dealt with issues of fatherhood; these included &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot; (1987), &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; (1989), &quot;Uncle Buck&quot; (1989), &quot;Kindergarten Cop&quot; (1990), &quot;Parenthood&quot; (1989), &quot;Hook&quot; (1991), and &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; (1993). These film types appeared among their respective release years&#x27; highest-grossing films, and focus on redeeming or celebrating the concept of fatherhood in different forms from warm and friendly to authoritarian. These father figures are initially unprepared for their responsibility. Nicole Matthews argues that the need to present a film targeted at both adults and children leads to the central characters being infantilized and immature. These films each share a similar concept, that female characters are either absent or not important to the overall story.

&quot;GhostbustersII&quot;″s driving plot is ostensibly about a mother (Dana Barrett) trying to protect her son who is the target of a malevolent force. Instead, it becomes about Peter Venkman and his relationship to the child, both representing a surrogate paternal figure and lamenting that he is not the child&#x27;s biological father. The film focuses on moments of paternal tenderness such as Venkman using his treasured football shirt to clothe Oscar. This focus is evident during the film&#x27;s finale where Vigo&#x27;s portrait is replaced by an image of the Ghostbusters as four paternal figures surrounding Oscar, with no female present. Instead a sword is depicted penetrating a stone; a symbol of fertility.

Jim Whalley wrote that when Dana describes Venkman as &quot;the most charming, kindest and most unusual&quot; man she has met, &quot;kind&quot; would not be an applicable description of his character in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, evidencing his growth and maturity in the intervening years. Venkman&#x27;s inability to commit to Dana ended their original relationship, but he is shown to have changed and now be willing to serve as a partner and father. Similarly, Murray&#x27;s comedic talents are seemingly ineffective throughout the film, unable to charm his way out of difficult situations as in &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and further the narrative. He instead serves as comic relief, and it is the Ghostbusters&#x27; noble heroism that progresses the story.

=== Politics ===
As with the previous film, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; criticizes political institutions. The team actively questions authority in a deteriorating city filled with unhappy people. Government representatives are shown to be more concerned with proper processes than the imminent threat of the ghosts. They are shown to be incompetent or pursuing an agenda of self-interest that means they cannot be trusted to protect the people they represent.

The Ghostbusters&#x27; outspokenness results in them being sent to a psychiatric institution to silence them. The Ghostbusters are freed from the governmental bonds—the legal requirements barring them from operating as paranormal exterminators—but only while they are solving more problems than they create. Christine Alice Corcos describes the courtroom scene, in which the executed Scoleri brothers&#x27; return to wreak havoc, as a demonstration of the failure of the legal system. The government must again empower the Ghostbusters to deal with the problem, reaffirming the team&#x27;s personal liberty over government influence. Corcos also analyzed the slime as a symbol of pollution. The human soul is polluted by negativity, which is given a physical form as slime beneath the city until there is too much for the Earth to handle.

Zoila Clark considered the ghosts to represent immigrants to America. Several antagonists and ghostly forces are foreign—the Scoleri brothers, the passengers of the Titanic, Janosz, and Vigo. Vigo is compared to Count Dracula, a threatening foreign entity that hypnotizes subjects with his eyes, and aims to take an American woman for his own. The Statue of Liberty is of French origin and although it is described as a symbol of purity, Murray&#x27;s character sexualizes it, defining it outside the American stereotype of purity.

== Legacy ==
=== Critical reassessment ===
Since its release, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; has been labeled as the film that &quot;killed&quot; the franchise because it made less money from a larger budget than &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and because the filming experience and resulting reception dissuaded Murray from involvement in a third film. While some modern critics continue to criticize it as a bad film or inferior to its predecessor, others argue that it suffers from being compared with &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; and is otherwise above average. In a 2014 interview, Reitman defended the film, saying while it was unfairly compared with &quot;Batman&quot; at the time, he felt &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; still holds up well against the superhero film.

&quot;Digital Spy&quot; defended the film as being as good as or better than &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. It said the plot of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; is arguably better executed than that of the first film, with multiple threads coming together in a &quot;seamless&quot; third act with a positive ending that works better with modern audiences. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; compared it to sequels to other genre-specific classics like &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984), which were considered not as good as the original but as good films in their own right, while &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; is perceived as being a bad film despite a close similarity to the original. &quot;Deadspin&quot; said that like those aforementioned films, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;″s darker setpieces and comedy made it more suited for adults than children, but that it is better than most people remember. &quot;Uproxx&quot; called it the ideal film to watch during the New Year period because it offers an unsubtle, simple morality tale about treating others well.

Contemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers a approval rating from critics, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Thanks to the cast, &quot;Ghostbusters 2&quot; is reasonably amusing, but it lacks the charm, wit, and energy of its predecessor&quot;. The film has a score of 56 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 14 critical reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. In 2009, Den of Geek listed it as the eighteenth best blockbuster sequel of all time.

=== Merchandise ===

Film merchandising was a relatively new concept created mainly by the success of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series. Merchandising for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was mostly unsuccessful as there was no plan in place to immediately capitalize on the film&#x27;s unexpected success; toys in particular sold poorly until the release of the cartoon spin-off &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot;. However, sequels were seen as a brighter prospect because they featured established characters. Over 24 tie-in toys were released alongside the film, including water guns, colored slimes, coloring books, comics, and children&#x27;s meals. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; action figures were the fifth-most in-demand toy for the 1989 Christmas season according to a survey of 15,000 retailers. Approximately 2.8 million units of a promotional noisemaker toy called the &quot;Ghostblaster&quot;, which was released across 3,100 outlets of the fast-food restaurant Hardee&#x27;s, were recalled in June 1989 because of reports children were ingesting its small batteries. Now Comics released a three-part comic book miniseries adaptation of the film set in &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; cartoon universe. The story included subplots from the film, including Ray&#x27;s possession while driving the Ectomobile and Tully trying to capture Slimer.

Several video games were released around the release of the film; &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; in 1989 for personal computers, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; (published by Activision) in 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and &quot;New Ghostbusters II&quot; (as &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;), also in 1990 for the Nintendo Game Boy. &quot;New GhostbustersII&quot; was also released for the NES in Europe and Japan but could not be released in America because Activision held the rights to the game there.

Since its release, &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; merchandise has included Playmobil sets with action figures and a model of the Ectomobile 1A. A board game, &quot;Ghostbusters: The Board Game II&quot;, was released in 2017 by Cryptozoic Entertainment. Based on the film, it casts the players as the Ghostbusters and tasks them with defeating Vigo and his ghostly minions. The game&#x27;s creation was crowdfunded, raising over $760,000. The 2019 Halloween Horror Nights event at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida held a &#x27;Ghostbusters-themed haunted maze that featured locations, characters, and ghosts from &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, and the Scoleri Brothers.

== Sequels and spin-offs ==

Discussion about a sequel took place during filming of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;, but Ramis was dismissive because of the actors&#x27; ages and the difficulty in getting the cast together. Despite &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; relative failure, the name recognition and popularity of the actors and their characters meant a third film was still pursued by the studio. The concept failed to progress for many years, reportedly primarily because of Murray&#x27;s reluctance to participate. &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; series continued to air until 1991 and ended after seven seasons; according to Medjuck, the cartoon series technically took place after the events of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;. &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; was followed in 1997 by a sequel series called &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;, which aimed to reinvigorate the franchise but lasted for only one season. In the years that followed the release of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;, Aykroyd continued attempts to develop a film sequel throughout the 1990s to the early 2010s. By 1999, he had completed a 122-page concept for a sequel called &quot;Ghostbusters III: Hellbent&quot;, which would add several new characters and take them to ManHellton, a demonic version of Manhattan, where they would encounter the demon Lucifer.

In 2009, &quot;&quot; featuring story consulting by Ramis and Aykroyd, and the likenesses and voice acting of Murray, Aykroyd, Ramis, Hudson, Potts, and William Atherton (who portrayed Walter Peck in the first movie), was released. Set two years after &quot;GhostbustersII&quot;, the story follows the Ghostbusters training a new recruit (the player) to combat a ghostly threat related to Gozer. The game was well-received, earning award nominations for its storytelling. Aykroyd said the game is &quot;essentially the third movie&quot;. The game establishes that following the events of &quot;GhostbustersII&quot; the still-possessed portrait of Vigo became a decoration at the Ghostbusters&#x27; firehouse. &quot;Ghostbusters: The Return&quot; (2004) was the first in a planned series of sequel novels before the publisher, iBooks, went out of business. Several &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; comic books have also continued the original characters&#x27; adventures across the globe and in other dimensions.

Following Ramis&#x27;s death in 2014, Reitman chose to no longer consider directing a potential third Ghostbusters film. He determined the creative control shared by himself, Ramis, Aykroyd, and Murray was holding the franchise back and negotiated a deal with the studio to sell the rights; he spent two weeks persuading Murray. Reitman refused to release details about the deal but said that &quot;the creators would be enriched for the rest of our lives, and for the rest of our children’s lives&quot;. He and Aykroyd set up the production company Ghost Corps to continue the franchise, starting with the 2016 female-led reboot, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. Before its release, the film was beset by controversies and on release it attracted mixed reviews and was considered a box office bomb. The franchise returned to the original two films with the sequels, &quot;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&quot; (2021), directed by Reitman&#x27;s son Jason, and &quot;&quot; (2024).

<doc id="618938" wikidata="Q241549" url="?curid=618938" title="Antiarrhythmic agent">
<text>Antiarrhythmic agents, also known as cardiac dysrhythmia medications, are a class of drugs that are used to suppress abnormally fast rhythms (tachycardias), such as atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia.

Many attempts have been made to classify antiarrhythmic agents. Many of the antiarrhythmic agents have multiple modes of action, which makes any classification imprecise.

==Action potential==


The cardiac myocyte has two general types of action potentials: conduction system and working myocardium. The action potential is divided into 5 phases and shown in the diagram. The sharp rise in voltage (&quot;0&quot;) corresponds to the influx of sodium ions, whereas the two decays (&quot;1&quot; and &quot;3&quot;, respectively) correspond to the sodium-channel inactivation and the repolarizing efflux of potassium ions. The characteristic plateau (&quot;2&quot;) results from the opening of voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Each phase utilizes different channels and it is useful to compare these phases to the most common classification system — Vaughan Williams — described below.

==Vaughan Williams classification==
The Vaughan Williams classification was introduced in 1970 by Miles Vaughan Williams.

Vaughan Williams was a pharmacology tutor at Hertford College, Oxford. One of his students, Bramah N. Singh, contributed to the development of the classification system. The system is therefore sometimes known as the Singh-Vaughan Williams classification.

The five main classes in the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmic agents are:
* Class I agents interfere with the sodium (Na+) channel.
* Class II agents are anti-sympathetic nervous system agents. Most agents in this class are beta blockers.
* Class III agents affect potassium (K+) efflux.
* Class IV agents affect calcium channels and the AV node.
* Class V agents work by other or unknown mechanisms.

With regard to management of atrial fibrillation, classes I and III are used in rhythm control as medical cardioversion agents, while classes II and IV are used as rate-control agents.

===Class I agents===
The class I antiarrhythmic agents interfere with the sodium channel.
Class I agents are grouped by what effect they have on the Na+ channel, and what effect they have on cardiac action potentials.

Class I agents are called membrane-stabilizing agents, &quot;stabilizing&quot; referring to the decrease of excitogenicity of the plasma membrane which is brought about by these agents. (Also noteworthy is that a few class II agents like propranolol also have a membrane stabilizing effect.)

Class I agents are divided into three groups (Ia, Ib, and Ic) based upon their effect on the length of the action potential.
* Class Ia drugs lengthen the action potential (right shift)
* Class Ib drugs shorten the action potential (left shift)
* Class Ic drugs do not significantly affect the action potential (no shift)


===Class II agents===
Class II agents are conventional beta blockers. They act by blocking the effects of catecholamines at the β1-adrenergic receptors, thereby decreasing sympathetic activity on the heart, which reduces intracellular cAMP levels and hence reduces Ca2+ influx. These agents are particularly useful in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias. They decrease conduction through the AV node.

Class II agents include atenolol, esmolol, propranolol, and metoprolol.

===Class III agents===

Class III agents predominantly block the potassium channels, thereby prolonging repolarization. Since these agents do not affect the sodium channel, conduction velocity is not decreased. The prolongation of the action potential duration and refractory period, combined with the maintenance of normal conduction velocity, prevent re-entrant arrhythmias. (The re-entrant rhythm is less likely to interact with tissue that has become refractory). The class III agents exhibit reverse-use dependence (their potency increases with slower heart rates, and therefore improves maintenance of sinus rhythm). Inhibiting potassium channels results in slowed atrial-ventricular myocyte repolarization. Class III agents have the potential to prolong the QT interval of the EKG, and may be proarrhythmic (more associated with development of polymorphic VT).

Class III agents include: bretylium, amiodarone, ibutilide, sotalol, dofetilide, vernakalant, and dronedarone.

===Class IV agents===
Class IV agents are slow non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. They decrease conduction through the AV node, and shorten phase two (the plateau) of the cardiac action potential. They thus reduce the contractility of the heart, so may be inappropriate in heart failure. However, in contrast to beta blockers, they allow the body to retain adrenergic control of heart rate and contractility.

Class IV agents include verapamil and diltiazem.

===Class V and others===
Since the development of the original Vaughan Williams classification system, additional agents have been used that do not fit cleanly into categories I through IV. Such agents include:
* Adenosine is used intravenously for terminating supraventricular tachycardias.
* Digoxin decreases conduction of electrical impulses through the AV node and increases vagal activity via its action on the central nervous system. Via indirect action, it leads to an increase in acetylcholine production, stimulating M2 receptors on AV node leading to an overall decrease in speed of conduction.
* Magnesium sulfate is an antiarrhythmic drug, but only used against very specific arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.

===History===
The initial classification system had 4 classes, although their definitions different from the modern classification. Those proposed in 1970 were:
# Drugs with a direct membrane action: the prototype was quinidine, and lignocaine was a key example. Differing from other authors, Vaughan-Williams describe the main action as a slowing of the rising phase of the action potential.
# Sympatholytic drugs (drugs blocking the effects of the sympathetic nervous system): examples included bretylium and adrenergic beta-receptors blocking drugs. This is similar to the modern classification, which focuses on the latter category.
# Compounds that prolong the action potential: matching the modern classification, with the key drug example being amiodarone, and a surgical example being thyroidectomy. This was not a defining characteristic in an earlier review by Charlier et al. (1968), but was supported by experimental data presented by Vaughan Williams (1970). The figure illustrating these findings was also published in the same year by Singh and Vaughan Williams.
# Drugs acting like diphenylhydantoin (DPH): mechanism of action unknown, but others had attributed its cardiac action to an indirect action on the brain; this drug is better known as antiepileptic drug phenytoin.

==Sicilian gambit classification==
Another approach, known as the &quot;Sicilian gambit&quot;, placed a greater approach on the underlying mechanism.

It presents the drugs on two axes, instead of one, and is presented in tabular form. On the Y axis, each drug is listed, in roughly the Singh-Vaughan Williams order. On the X axis, the channels, receptors, pumps, and clinical effects are listed for each drug, with the results listed in a grid. It is, therefore, not a true classification in that it does not aggregate drugs into categories.

==Modernized Oxford classification by Lei, Huang, Wu, and Terrar==

A recent publication (2018) has now emerged with a fully modernised drug classification. This preserves the simplicity of the original Vaughan Williams framework while capturing subsequent discoveries of sarcolemmal, sarcoplasmic reticular and cytosolic biomolecules. The result is an expanded but pragmatic classification that encompasses approved and potential anti-arrhythmic drugs. This will aid our understanding and clinical management of cardiac arrhythmias and facilitate future therapeutic developments. It starts by considering the range of pharmacological targets, and tracks these to their particular cellular electrophysiological effects. It retains but expands the original Vaughan Williams classes I to IV, respectively covering actions on Na+ current components, autonomic signalling, K+ channel subspecies, and molecular targets related to Ca2+ homeostasis. It now introduces new classes incorporating additional targets, including:
*Class 0: ion channels involved in automaticity
*Class V: mechanically sensitive ion channels
*Class VI: connexins controlling electrotonic cell coupling
*Class VII: molecules underlying longer term signalling processes affecting structural remodeling.
It also allows for multiple drug targets/actions and adverse pro-arrhythmic effects. The new scheme will additionally aid development of novel drugs under development and is illustrated here.

<doc id="618944" wikidata="Q602403" url="?curid=618944" title="Klaus Janson">
<text>Klaus Janson (born January 23, 1952) is a German-born American comics artist, working regularly for Marvel Comics and DC Comics and sporadically for independent companies. While he is best known as an inker, Janson has frequently worked as a penciller and colorist.

==Early life==
Klaus Janson was born in Coburg, West Germany. He emigrated to the United States in 1957, settling with his family in Connecticut, where he lived in Bridgeport from 1957 to 1972. When he was young, his Spider-Man collection was thrown away by his mother. Janson then became interested in the premiering character Daredevil, who wasn&#x27;t popular among Janson&#x27;s friends.

==Career==
After a short stint as assistant to Dick Giordano in the early 1970s, Janson&#x27;s first credited comics artwork was published by Marvel Comics in &quot;Jungle Action&quot; #6 (Sept. 1973). Janson came to prominence as the inker over Sal Buscema&#x27;s pencils on &quot;The Defenders&quot;. Since then he has freelanced on most of the major titles at Marvel and DC. In 1975 he began a long run as inker on &quot;Daredevil&quot;, running from #124 (Aug. 1975) to #196 (July 1983). With #171 the series went from bi-monthly to monthly; unable to handle the increased workload, then-writer/penciler Frank Miller began increasingly relying on Janson for the artwork, sending him looser and looser pencils beginning with #173. By issue #185, Miller had virtually relinquished his role as Daredevil&#x27;s artist, and was providing only rough layouts for Janson to pencil, ink, and color. After Miller&#x27;s departure, Janson drew the series by himself for four issues.

Janson began working for DC Comics in the early 1980s and inked Gene Colan&#x27;s pencils on &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and &quot;Jemm, Son of Saturn&quot;. Janson was one of the artists on &quot;Superman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1984) and was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series. His collaboration with Miller on &quot;Daredevil&quot; would soon be eclipsed by a second collaboration between them, on &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight Returns&quot; in 1986. Janson has frequently pencilled and inked for various Batman titles, including the first &quot;Detective Comics Annual&quot; with writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil, &quot;&quot; with Grant Morrison, and &quot;&quot; with Doug Moench. In 1994, Janson drew the &quot;Batman-Spawn: War Devil&quot; intercompany crossover which was written by Moench, Chuck Dixon, and Alan Grant. Janson wrote a short story in the anthology miniseries &quot;&quot; #3 (August 1996). Janson drew part of the &quot;&quot; crossover as well.

Janson and writer Mike Baron introduced the character Microchip as an ally of the Punisher in &quot;The Punisher&quot; #4 (November 1987). In 1993, Janson drew a three-part story featuring Electro for &quot;Spider-Man&quot; #38–40. Janson inked the early issues of &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot; which had been written and penciled by Dan Jurgens. Janson&#x27;s work as an inker and occasional penciler at Marvel Comics includes collaborations with John Romita Jr. on &quot;Wolverine&quot;, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Black Panther&quot;. His other work includes &quot;Batman: Death and the Maidens&quot;, &quot;World War Hulk&quot;, &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, and &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. In 2010, he inked Romita Jr.&#x27;s pencils on &quot;The Avengers&quot;. and in 2014 the two artists collaborated on &quot;Superman&quot;. Janson was one of the artists on &quot;The Dark Knight III: The Master Race&quot; which was co-written by Frank Miller and Brian Azzarello.

Janson has taught sequential storytelling at the School of Visual Arts in New York City since the 1990s and has written both &quot;The DC Comics Guide to Pencilling Comics&quot; and &quot;The DC Comics Guide to Inking Comics.&quot; Janson also holds annual seminars at Marvel for the editorial staff and their up-and-coming artists, and taught short courses on comics storytelling for the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art.

In 2015, Janson was the Guest of Honor at the 2015 Inkwell Awards Awards Ceremony at HeroesCon.

<text>Jean Vilbrun Guillaume Sam (; 4 March 1859 – 28 July 1915) was President of Haiti from 4 March 1915 until his assassination months later. He was the son of Tirésias Simon Sam, Haiti&#x27;s president from 1896 to 1902.

==Career==
Sam was the commander of Haiti&#x27;s Northern Division when he led the revolt which brought President Cincinnatus Leconte to power. 
He later headed the revolt which toppled President Oreste Zamor. 
On 25 February 1915 Sam was proclaimed president when his predecessor, Joseph Davilmar Théodore, was forced to resign, because he was unable to pay the militiamen, known as the &quot;Cacos&quot;, who had helped him overthrow Zamor.

As Haiti&#x27;s fifth president in five turbulent years, Sam was forced to contend with a revolt against his own regime, led by Dr. Rosalvo Bobo, who opposed the government&#x27;s expanded commercial and strategic ties with the United States. Fearing that he would share the same fate as his predecessors, Sam acted harshly against his political opponents, particularly the better-educated and wealthier mulatto population. On 27 July 1915, his repression culminated in his ordering the execution of 167 political prisoners—including former president Zamor, who was being held in a Port-au-Prince jail. This infuriated the Haitian people, who rose up against Sam&#x27;s government as soon as news of these executions reached them.

==Assassination==
Sam fled to the French embassy, where he received asylum. The rebels&#x27; mulatto leaders broke into the embassy and found Sam. They dragged him out and beat him to death.

==Legacy==
For the next two weeks, the country was in chaos. News of the murder soon reached the American Navy ships anchored in the city&#x27;s harbor. President Woodrow Wilson, who was wary about the turn of events in Haiti, and especially the possibility that Bobo would take power, ordered American troops to seize the capital. They landed on 28 July 1915, and continued to occupy the country for nineteen years, until August 1934.

Sam&#x27;s chief of police, Charles Oscar Étienne, who cleaned out the jails by executing his political opponents, inspired the boogeymen Haitian carnival disguises known as &quot;Chaloska&quot;.

==In literature and the arts==
Eugene O&#x27;Neill stated that Sam was the inspiration for his 1920 play &quot;The Emperor Jones.&quot;

Sam is the main figure in Arthur J. Burks&#x27;s short story &quot;Thus Spake the Prophetess&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, November 1924).

Sam appears as a supporting character in the 1993 Doctor Who novel &quot;White Darkness&quot; which is set during his presidency. The novel takes several liberties with history, having Sam committing suicide rather than being murdered by the rebels as was actually the case.

<text>Zdeněk Kopal (; 4 April 1914 – 23 June 1993) was a Czechoslovak astronomer who mainly worked in England.

Kopal was born and grew up in Litomyšl (Czechoslovakia, now Czech Republic). In his early astronomical career, he studied variable stars and in particular close eclipsing binary stars. He attended Cambridge University in 1938 and later that year he went to Harvard College Observatory. After the war he became head of the astronomy department at the University of Manchester. He later assisted NASA with the Apollo program as an external expert.

He was editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;Astrophysics and Space Science&quot; since its foundation in 1968 until his death in 1993.

The asteroid 2628 Kopal was named in his honor.

<text>In the context of the history of slavery in the Americas, free people of color (; ) were primarily people of mixed African, European, and Native American descent who were not enslaved. However, the term also applied to people born free who were primarily of black African descent with little mixture. They were a distinct group of free people of color in the French colonies, including Louisiana and in settlements on Caribbean islands, such as Saint-Domingue (Haiti), St. Lucia, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Martinique. In these territories and major cities, particularly New Orleans, and those cities held by the Spanish, a substantial third class of primarily mixed-race, free people developed. These colonial societies classified mixed-race people in a variety of ways, generally related to visible features and to the proportion of African ancestry. Racial classifications were numerous in Latin America.

A freed African slave was known as &quot;affranchi&quot; (). The term was sometimes meant to include the free people of color, but they considered the term pejorative since they had been born free.

The term gens de couleur libres ( (&quot;free people of color&quot;) was commonly used in France&#x27;s West Indian colonies prior to the abolition of slavery. It frequently referred to free people of mixed African and European ancestry.

In British North America, the term free Negro was often used to cover the same class of people—those who were legally free and visibly of African descent.

==Saint-Domingue==
By the late 18th century prior to the Haitian Revolution, Saint-Domingue was legally divided into three distinct groups: free whites (who were divided socially between the plantation-class &quot;grands blancs&quot; and the working-class &quot;petits blancs&quot;); freedmen (&quot;affranchis&quot;), and slaves. More than half of the &quot;affranchis&quot; were &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;; others were considered freed black slaves. In addition, &quot;maroons&quot; (runaway slaves) were sometimes able to establish independent small communities and a kind of freedom in the mountains, along with remnants of Haiti&#x27;s original Taino people. A large group of surviving Native Taino&#x27;s also supported the Haitian Revolution; they were known as &quot;indiens esclaves&quot; which numbered about 5,000. In a 1780 census, there was also a group listed as &quot;indiens sauvages&quot;, which Haitian historians believe were the native Arawak and Taino that were known to live in tiny reclusive mountain communities at this point.

Jean-Jacques Dessalines, the first ruler of independent Haiti and a leader of the Revolution, talked about people whom he called &quot;Rouges&quot; (reds), or sometimes &quot;Incas&quot; in his letters. When they were spoken about in context of the war, he makes mention of cooperation between Africans and Natives in maroon communities that plotted against colonists on the southern peninsula. He also discusses &quot;Incas among his men&quot; showing him secret burial quarters in the Artibonite valley that could be used by rebels as shelter and storage. There were 3,000 known Native peoples (both &quot;esclaves&quot; and &quot;sauvages&quot;) living in Haiti in the years before independence, according to a 1802 colonial census.

Dessalines did not forget these people and their sacrifices against Spain and now, France. He named the Haitian army &quot;the Incas&quot;, &quot;the Army of the Sun&quot; and eventually &quot;the Indigenous Army&quot; in honor of them. He also renamed the island &quot;Haiti&quot;, its pre-Columbian name.

When slavery was ended in the colony in 1793, by action of the French government following the French Revolution, there were approximately 28,000 &quot;anciens libres&quot; (&quot;free before&quot;) in Saint-Domingue. The term was used to distinguish those who were already free, compared to those liberated by the general emancipation of 1793. About 16,000 of these &quot;anciens libres&quot; were &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;. Another 12,000 were &quot;affranchis&quot;, black former slaves who had either purchased their freedom or had been given it by their masters for various reasons.

===Rights===
Regardless of their ethnicity, in Saint-Domingue freedmen had been able to own land. Some acquired plantations and owned large numbers of slaves themselves. The slaves were generally not friendly with the freedmen, who sometimes portrayed themselves to whites as bulwarks against a slave uprising. As property owners, freedmen tended to support distinct lines set between their own class and that of slaves. Also often working as artisans, shopkeepers or landowners, the &quot;gens de couleur&quot; frequently became quite prosperous, and many prided themselves on their European culture and descent. They were often well-educated in the French language, and they tended to scorn the Haitian Creole language used by slaves. Most &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; were reared as Roman Catholic, also part of French culture, and many denounced the Vodoun religion brought with slaves from Africa.

Under the &quot;ancien régime&quot;, despite the provisions of equality nominally established in the &quot;Code Noir&quot;, the &quot;gens de couleur&quot; were limited in their freedoms. They did not possess the same rights as Frenchmen, specifically the right to vote. Most supported slavery on the island, at least up to the time of the French Revolution. But they sought equal rights for free people of color, which became an early central issue of the unfolding Haitian Revolution.

The primary adversary of the &quot;gens de couleur&quot; before and into the Haitian Revolution were the working-class white people such as farmers and tradesmen of the colony, known as the &quot;petits blancs&quot; (&quot;small whites&quot;). Because of the freedmen&#x27;s relative economic success in the region, sometimes related to blood ties to influential whites people, the &quot;petits blancs&quot; farmers often resented their social standing and worked to keep them shut out of government. Beyond financial incentives, the free coloreds caused the working-class whites further problems in finding women to start a family. The successful mulattos often won the hands of the small number of eligible women on the island. With growing resentment, the working-class whites monopolized assembly participation and caused the free people of color to look to France for legislative assistance.

===French citizenship===
The free people of color won a major political battle on May 15, 1791, when the Constituent Assembly in France voted to give full French citizenship to them, on the condition of having two free parents. The decree was revoked on September 24, 1791, and replaced by a new, more generous decree on April 4, 1792, that gave full French citizenship to all free people, regardless of the color of their skin and the statuses of their parents. This was followed by a proclamation on February 4, 1794, which abolished slavery in French colonies, granting citizenship rights to all, regardless of color.

===Struggle===
In their competition for power, both the poor whites and free coloreds enlisted the help of slaves. By doing this, the feud helped to disintegrate class discipline and propel the slave population in the colony to seek further inclusion and liberties in society. As the widespread slave rebellion in the north of the island wore on, many free people of color abandoned their earlier distance from the slaves. A growing coalition between the free coloreds and the former slaves was essential for the eventual success of the Haitians to expel French influence.

The former slaves and the &quot;anciens libres&quot; still remained segregated in many respects. Their animosity and struggle for power erupted in 1799. The competition between the &quot;gens de couleur&quot; led by André Rigaud and the black Haitians led by Toussaint Louverture devolved into the War of the Knives.

After their loss in that conflict, many wealthy &quot;gens de couleur&quot; left as refugees to France, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the United States and elsewhere. Some took slaves with them. Others, however, remained to play an influential role in Haitian politics.

==Caribbean==
Free people of color were an important part generally in the history of the Caribbean during the period of slavery and afterward. Initially descendants of French men and African and Indian slaves (and later French men and free women of color), and often marrying within their own mixed-race community, some achieved wealth and power. By the late eighteenth century, most free people of color in Saint-Domingue were native born and part of colored families that had been free for generations.

Free people of color were leaders in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, which achieved independence in 1804 as the Republic of Haiti. In Saint-Domingue, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and other French Caribbean colonies before slavery was abolished, the free people of color were known as &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot;, and &quot;affranchis&quot;. Comparable mixed-race groups became an important part of the populations of the British colony of Jamaica, the Spanish colonies of Santo Domingo, Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dutch colony of Suriname and the Portuguese colony of Brazil.

==New Orleans and New France==

Free people of color played an important role in the history of New Orleans and the southern area of New France, both when the area was controlled by the French and Spanish, and after its acquisition by the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

When French settlers and traders first arrived in these colonies, the men frequently took Native American women as their concubines or common-law wives (see Marriage &#x27;à la façon du pays&#x27;). When African slaves were imported to the colony, many colonists took African women as concubines or wives. In the colonial period of French and Spanish rule, men tended to marry later after becoming financially established. Later, when more white families had settled or developed here, some young French men or ethnic French Creoles still took mixed-race women as mistresses, often known as &quot;placées&quot;.

Popular stereotypes portray such unions as formal, financial transactions arranged between a white man and the mother of the mixed-race mistress. Supposedly, the young woman of mixed European and African ancestry would attend dances known as &quot;quadroon balls&quot; to meet white gentlemen willing to provide for her and any children she bears from their union. The relationship would end as soon as the man married properly. According to legend, free girls of color were raised by their mothers to become concubines for white men, as they themselves once were.

However, evidence suggests that on account of the community&#x27;s piety by the late 18th century, free women of color usually preferred the legitimacy of marriage with other free men of color. In cases where free women of color did enter extramarital relationships with white men, such unions were overwhelmingly lifelong and exclusive. Many of these white men remained legal bachelors for life. This form of interracial cohabitation was often viewed as no different from the modern conception of a common-law marriage. 

As in Saint-Domingue, the free people of color developed as a separate class between the colonial French and Spanish and the mass of black slaves. They often achieved education, practiced artisan trades, and gained some measure of wealth; they spoke French and practiced Catholicism. Many also developed a syncretic Christianity. At one time the center of their residential community in New Orleans was the French Quarter. Many were artisans who owned property and their own businesses. They formed a social category distinct from both whites and slaves, and maintained their own society into the period after United States annexation.

Some historians suggest that free people of color made New Orleans the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States. They achieved more rights than did free people of color or free blacks in the Thirteen Colonies, including serving in the armed militia. After the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory, Creoles in New Orleans and the region worked to integrate the military &quot;en masse&quot;. William C. C. Claiborne, appointed by Thomas Jefferson as governor of the Territory of Orleans, formally accepted delivery of the French colony on December 20, 1803.

==Military service==
Free men of color had been armed members of the militia for decades during both Spanish and French rule of the colony of Louisiana. They volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to Claiborne and to their newly adopted country. In early 1804, the new U.S. administration in New Orleans under Governor Claiborne was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the United States, the integration of the military by incorporating entire units of established &quot;colored&quot; militia. See, e.g., the February 20, 1804 letter from Secretary of War Henry Dearborn to Claiborne, stating that &quot;it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense.&quot;

A decade later during the War of 1812, the militia which consisted of free men of color volunteered to join the force mustered by Andrew Jackson in preparation for the Battle of New Orleans, when the British began landing troops outside the city in December 1814 in preparation for an invasion of the city. The battle resulted in a decisive American victory, in which black soldiers played a critical role. However, many black troops who had been promised freedom in exchange for service were forcibly returned to slavery after the battle&#x27;s conclusion.

==Definition==

There was relatively little manumission of slaves until after the revolution. Throughout the slave societies of the Americas, some slave owners took advantage of the power relationships to use female slaves sexually; sometimes they had extended relationships of concubinage. However, in the Thirteen Colonies, the children of these relationships were not usually emancipated.

South Carolina diarist Mary Chesnut wrote in the mid-19th century that &quot;like the patriarchs of old our men live all in one house with their wives and their concubines, and the mulattos one sees in every family exactly resemble the white children ...&quot; In some places, especially in the French and Spanish Caribbean and South American slave societies, the ethnic European father might acknowledge the relationship and his children. Some were common-law marriages of affection. Slaveholders were more likely to free their mixed-race children of these relationships than they were to free other slaves. They also sometimes freed the enslaved women who were their concubines.

Many slave societies allowed masters to free their slaves. As the population of color became larger and the white ruling class felt more threatened by potential instability, they worked through their governments to increase restrictions on manumissions. These usually included taxes, requirements that some socially useful reason be cited for manumission, and a requirement that a newly freed person demonstrate a means of independent support. Masters might free their slaves for a variety of reasons, but the most common was a family relationship between master and slave.

Slaves sometimes gained a measure of freedom by purchasing themselves, when allowed to save some portion of earnings if leased out or selling produce. The master determined if one had to pay market or reduced value. In other cases, relatives who were already free and earning money purchased others. Sometimes masters, or the government, would free slaves without payment as a reward for some notable service; a slave who revealed slave conspiracies for uprisings was sometimes rewarded with freedom.

Many people who lived as free within the slave societies did not have formal liberty papers. In some cases, these were refugees, who hid in the towns among free people of color and tried to maintain a low profile. In other cases, they were &quot;living as free&quot; with the permission of their master, sometimes in return for payment of rent or a share of money they earned by trades. The master never made their freedom official, as in the case of Margaret Morgan, who had been living as a free person in Pennsylvania but was captured in 1837 and sold together with her children under claims that they were still slaves according to the laws of Maryland.

==Economic influence==
Free people of color filled an important niche in the economy of slave societies. In most places they worked as artisans and small retail merchants in the towns. In many places, especially in the American South, there were restrictions on people of color owning slaves and agricultural land. But many free blacks lived in the countryside, and some became major slaveholders. In the antebellum years, individual slaves who were freed often stayed on or near the plantations where they or their ancestors had been slaves, and where they had extended family. Masters often used free blacks as plantation managers or overseers, especially if the master had a family relationship with the mixed-race man.

In the early 19th century, societies required apprenticeships for free blacks to ensure they developed a means of support. For instance, in North Carolina, &quot;By the late 1830s, then, county courts could apprentice orphans, fatherless or abandoned children, illegitimate children, and free black children whose parents were not employed.

However, the number of apprenticeships declined as the number of free blacks increased. In some Southern states after the Nat Turner slave rebellion of 1831, the legislatures passed laws that forbade the teaching of free blacks or slaves to read and write, which was a requirement for having an apprenticeship. There was fear if blacks could read and write, they might start slave revolts and rebellions. Blacks were not allowed to apprentice as an editor or work in a printing press. Despite the restrictions of some apprenticeships, many free blacks benefited from their time as an apprentice.

In Caribbean colonies, governments sometimes hired free people of color as rural police to hunt down runaway slaves and keep order among the slave population. From the view of the white enslaver class in places such as Saint-Domingue or Jamaica, this was a critical function in a society in which the population of slaves on large plantations vastly outnumbered whites.

In places where law or social custom permitted it, some free people of color managed to acquire good agricultural land and slaves and become planters themselves. Free blacks owned plantations in almost all the slave societies of the Americas. In the United States, free people of color may have owned the most property in Louisiana, as France and Spain had allowed the territory&#x27;s Creole residents more recognition of mixed-race children before its acquisition by the United States. A man who had a relationship with a woman of color often also arranged for a transfer of wealth to her and their children, whether through deed of land and property to the mother and/or children under the system of &quot;plaçage&quot;, or by arranging for an apprenticeship to a trade for their mixed-race children, which provided them a better opportunity to make a skilled living, or by educating sons in France and easing their way into the military. In St. Domingue by the late colonial period, &quot;gens de couleur&quot; owned about one-third of the land and about one-quarter of the slaves, mostly in the southern part of the island.

==Post-slavery==

When the end of slavery came, the distinction between former free coloreds and former slaves persisted in some societies. Because of advantages in the social capital of education and experience, free people of color often became leaders for the newly freed people. In Saint-Domingue, Toussaint Louverture had gained freedom before he became a leader in the slave rebellion, but he is not believed to have been of mixed race.

In the United States, many of the African Americans elected as state and local officials during Reconstruction in the South had been free in the South before the Civil War. Other new leaders were educated men of color from the North whose families had long been free and who went to the South to work and help the freedmen. Some were elected to office.

==Today==

Many descendants of the &quot;gens de couleur&quot;, or free people of color, of the Louisiana area celebrate their culture and heritage through a New Orleans–based Louisiana Creole Research Association (LA Créole). The term &quot;Créole&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;free people of color&quot; or &quot;gens de couleur libre&quot;, but many members of LA Créole have traced their genealogies through those lines. Today, the (often multiracial) descendants of the French and Spanish colonists, Africans, and other ethnicities are widely known as Louisiana Creoles. Louisiana&#x27;s Governor Bobby Jindal signed Act 276 on 14 June 2013, creating the &quot;prestige&quot; license plate, &quot;I&#x27;m Creole&quot;, honoring Louisiana Creoles&#x27; contributions and heritage.

The terms Louisiana &quot;Créole&quot; and &quot;Cajun&quot; have sometimes been confused, as members of each group generally had ancestors who were French-speaking; but the terms are not synonymous. The Cajuns often have some ancestry tracing back to French colonists who were expelled from Acadia (in eastern Canada) and resettled in Louisiana in the 18th century, generally outside the New Orleans area. Generations later, some of their culture relates to that of the Louisiana Creoles, but they are distinct. Members of each group may be multi-ethnic.

<text>Sal Buscema ( ; born Silvio Buscema, , on January 26, 1936) is an American comics artist, primarily for Marvel Comics, where he had a ten-year run as artist of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and an eight-year run as artist of &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;. He is the younger brother of comics artist John Buscema.

==Early life, family and education==
Born in Brooklyn, New York City, to Sicilian parents, Silvio &quot;Sal&quot; Buscema was the youngest of four siblings. His father, who was born in Italy and died in 1973, was a barber. Sal&#x27;s brothers were Alfred and John, a celebrated comic-book artist, and his sister was Carol.

As a youth, Buscema was a fan of Hal Foster&#x27;s &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; comic strip, of George Tuska&#x27;s comic-book art, and of commercial illustrators such has Robert Fawcett and Norman Rockwell. He acknowledged that his artist brother John was &quot;greatly responsible for me pursuing drawing. ... John was definitely an inspiration&quot;.

John and Sal attended the High School of Music &amp; Art; Sal graduated in 1955.

==Career==
===Early years===
Sal began working in the comic book industry as an inker in the early 1950s when his brother agreed to let him ink comics pages; this led to Sal helping John by doing occasional background art on Dell Comics series John was drawing.

After high school, Buscema found work at &quot;a small, two-man advertising art studio in Manhattan&quot; but was fired after three months of doing mostly production work. He went on to a larger commercial-art studio, where he was a gofer and a delivery person. He quit, then spent less than a year filling wedding-ring orders for the jewelry manufacturer J.R. Wood and Sons before being drafted into the peacetime U. S. Army in 1956. Classified as an &quot;illustrator&quot;, he served with the Army Corps of Engineers stationed at Fort Belvoir in Virginia. He spent 21 months doing film strips and charts as training aids before being discharged. He attained the rank of specialist 3rd class, which he called &quot;equivalent to corporal.&quot;

Sal briefly returned to New York City to assist at a one-man art studio, but through a friend from the army, he secured a position at Creative Arts Studio in Washington, D.C. where he did illustrations for government agencies, including the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Defense. After living with his godparents for three months, Buscema and an Army buddy became roommates in Alexandria, Virginia.

In 1961, a call from his brother John brought Buscema to New York City to work with him at the advertising agency Alexander Chaite, Inc. After a year and a half, John returned to the comic book industry. Sal joined Mel Emde, a friend and colleague from Creative Arts Studio, who was opening his own company, Design Studio. Sal worked there until 1968.

===Marvel Comics===
In 1968, Sal began working for Marvel Comics, where John was already established as a freelance artist. Sal had spent &quot;every night for about a year&quot; teaching himself &quot;how to produce a dynamic page&quot; in the Marvel Comics storytelling style, enduring harsh critiques from John. Sal recalled in the late 2000s:

The interview had come about after Buscema, at his brother&#x27;s urging, had first written to Marvel production manager Sol Brodsky to introduce himself and his work. Brodsky had no assignments for him at the time, and Buscema &quot;called him a couple of times just to bug him a little bit and let him know that I was still alive, and eventually the first job came through&quot; in June 1968 — the 10-page Western feature &quot;Gunhawk&quot;. &quot;I think they just said, &#x27;Sal, here&#x27;s the plot, go to it,&#x27;&quot; Buscema recalled in 2003. That story, &quot;The Coming of Gunhawk&quot;, by writer Jerry Siegel and penciler Werner Roth, was published in the omnibus title &quot;Western Gunfighters&quot; #1 (cover-dated Aug. 1970). Sal&#x27;s first published comics work had come before that: inking John Buscema&#x27;s pencil art on four 39- to 40-page stories in the superhero comic &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; #4–7 (Feb.–Aug. 1969); and inking Larry Lieber&#x27;s pencils on the regular-sized, 20-page Western &quot;The Rawhide Kid&quot; #68 (Feb. 1969).

John Buscema specifically asked for his brother as inker on &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot;, at the time a high-profile project dear to writer-editor Lee, who gave the character an unprecedented for the time double-sized, 64-page (with ads and covers) solo series priced at 25 cents, more than twice the price of the standard 32-page, 12-cent comic. Sal Buscema recalled,
Within a year, Buscema was penciling the superhero-team comic &quot;The Avengers&quot;, and for the next thirty years, he was one of the most prolific artists at the company. He recalled in the late 2000s, &quot;At first I was very slow. If I knocked out six or eight pages a week I was happy. Then I started getting a little bit better, and I could probably do a couple of pages a day. But once I hit that five-year transitional period, I was like a machine. I could grind the stuff out. ... Everything just fell into place, and all of a sudden I found it very easy to do.&quot;

Sal and writer Roy Thomas introduced the Squadron Sinister in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #69 (Oct. 1969) as a homage to the Justice League. The Thomas/Buscema team produced the last new story in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; before that series became all-reprints for several years, and created the super-villain Llyra in &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; #32 (Dec. 1970). Buscema drew an &quot;Avengers&quot; story plotted by science fiction writer Harlan Ellison, which featured the debut of Psyklop. Writer Steve Englehart and Buscema launched &quot;The Defenders&quot; as an ongoing series in August 1972 and introduced Valkyrie to the team in issue #4 (Feb. 1973). Buscema also worked with Englehart on &quot;Captain America&quot;; their 1972–1975 run on that title saw it become one of Marvel&#x27;s top-sellers. The pair teamed on several issues of &quot;The Avengers&quot; as well and Englehart has described Buscema as being one of his &quot;all-time favorites&quot; and &quot;a perfect comic book storyteller.&quot; With writer Steve Gerber, Buscema co-created Starhawk, adding the character to the roster of the future-based super-team, The Guardians of the Galaxy. In 2010, &quot;Comics Bulletin&quot; ranked Buscema&#x27;s collaboration with Gerber on &quot;The Defenders&quot; first on its list of the Top 10 1970s Marvels.

With writer Bill Mantlo, Buscema created the supporting character Jean DeWolff in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #48 (Aug. 1976). Mantlo, a frequent collaborator, later said that Buscema was a formative influence on his plotting. Buscema was the original artist on &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, which debuted in December 1976. He and Jim Shooter created Graviton in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #158 (April 1977). The &quot;Rom&quot; series was launched by Mantlo and Buscema in December 1979. The Mantlo/Buscema collaboration on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; included the creation of the U-Foes and the Soviet Super-Soldiers. Buscema had a 10-year run on that Hulk series, which he described as &quot;[p]robably one of the most enjoyable experiences of my career. The fact that the Hulk is my all-time favorite character might be a contributing factor. I never tired of the character. Every story was a new challenge.&quot; He became the artist on &quot;New Mutants&quot;, beginning with issue #4 (June 1983). Beginning in the late 1970s, Buscema generally inked his own work. In 1986, he began drawing &quot;Thor&quot;, working with writer Walt Simonson. In the late 1980s, he returned to inking others&#x27; work, again including that of his brother John Buscema on an Englehart-scripted run on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot;.

===Later career===
From 1988 through 1996, he penciled and mostly inked a 100-issue run on &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;. This included such story arcs as the &quot;Lobo Brothers Gang War&quot; with Gerry Conway and &quot;The Child Within&quot;, written by J. M. DeMatteis, featuring the death of Harry Osborn in #200 (May 1993). In a 2002 interview, DeMatteis said, &quot;I really loved the two years on &quot;Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; that I wrote with Sal Buscema drawing. Talk about underrated! Sal is one of the best storytellers and a wonderful collaborator. I loved that run.&quot; 

From 1997 to 1999, Buscema worked for rival DC Comics, including penciling Batman, Superman, and Superboy stories, and inking the Creeper, Wonder Woman, and other characters&#x27; stories. He recalled, &quot;[T]he short time I worked for DC, they were giving me all these young guys that could hardly hold a pencil in their hands, and asking me to &#x27;tweak it.&#x27; In cases like that I would definitely put a lot of myself into it and change whatever I felt needed to be changed.&quot;

Buscema then returned to Marvel, inking Pat Olliffe on &quot;Spider-Girl 1999&quot;, the summer annual of that series, and did work for both companies briefly before becoming the regular inker on &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 3, #11–20 (Feb.–Nov. 2000) and inking a smattering of other titles. In 2003, he described himself as &quot;retired for three years ... and I&#x27;m still inking jobs for Marvel!&quot; That same year he returned to comics full-time, inking Oliffe on &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; #55 (March 2003) and then launching into a long stint inking or doing finished art over pencil layouts by Ron Frenz from issues #59–100 (June 2003 – Sept. 2006). He continued to ink the series when it was relaunched as &quot;The Amazing Spider-Girl&quot; #1–30 (Dec. 2006 – May 2009). He inked Spider-Girl stories over Frenz&#x27;s pencils in the omnibus title &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; vol. 2, #1–7 (Dec. 2009 – June 2010) and in the four-issue miniseries &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Girl&quot; vol. 2 (July–Oct. 2010) and the one-shot &quot;Spider-Girl: The End!&quot; #1 (Oct. 2010). In 2011, he was the inker, over Frenz, on the five-issue superhero miniseries &quot;Thunderstrike&quot; vol. 2. He returned to DC Comics in 2011 with &quot;DC Retroactive: The Flash – The &#x27;70s&quot; and a Superman one-shot, &quot;Superman Beyond&quot; In 2012, Buscema inked IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;G.I. Joe Annual&quot; and the ongoing &quot;Dungeons and Dragons: Forgotten Realms&quot; series. In 2017, he started inking long-time collaborator Ron Frenz on &quot;The Blue Baron&quot;, written by Darin Henry and published by the new company Sitcomics.

==Personal life==
In February 1959, Buscema started dating Joan, a secretary at Creative Arts Studio in Washington, D.C., where he worked. They married in May 1960. Their first son, Joe, was born in 1968, followed by Tony and Mike.

Buscema has acted in community theatre. He was recognized in 1987 with BRAPA (Blue Ridge Alliance of Performing Arts) for his portrayal of Tevye in &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; in which he appeared at the Little Theatre of Alexandria, Virginia in 1998.

==Awards==
Buscema received the Inkpot Award in 2003 and the Hero Initiative Lifetime Achievement Award in September 2013 at the Baltimore Comic-Con. In 2013, Buscema received the Inkwell Awards&#x27; S.P.A.M.I. (Favorite Small Press and Mainstream-Independent) Award for his work on such titles as &quot;G.I. Joe Annual&quot; and &quot;Dungeons and Dragons: Forgotten Realms&quot;. In 2018, he was awarded the Inkwell Awards S.P.A.M.I. Award again, for his work on &quot;Rom&quot;. Buscema was awarded the Inkwell Awards Stacey Aragon Special Recognition Award (SASRA) in 2020. In 2021 Buscema was awarded the Inkwell Awards Joe Sinnott Hall of Fame Award for his inking career. In 2022, Sal Buscema won the Ringo Award as best inker for his work on &quot;Heroes Union&quot; #1.

<text>Northgate Shopping Centre is the third largest shopping centre in Tasmania. Located in Glenorchy approximately 10 kilometres northwest of Hobart. The shopping centre is located on the Main Road within the CBD of Glenorchy with all stores located on the one level and a large undercover carpark situated below the main building. It was constructed on the site that had been that of the Glenorchy Tannery also known as Cook&#x27;s Tannery.

The centre was opened in November 1986 as a convenience centre anchored by a Coles Supermarket along with 46 speciality stores. The centre has since been refurbished and expanded in October 1995.
The shopping centre has had various calamities, in 2002 power cuts, and was involved in a fire in 2005.
It had also been a property within the Westfield range of centres in Australia.
Target and Best &amp; Less to the centre as major anchor retailers were added in the early 2000s. There are also approximately 65 other speciality stores. As of 2009, the centre has been owned by Novion Property Group (CFSGAM) who merged into Vicinity Centres in 2015. In 2016, the centre introduced a freshly renovated main entrance, and rebranded the store to use Vicinity&#x27;s ribbon as their logo. The anchoring Target department store closed permanently in early 2022. On 4 November 2022, a Woolworths supermarket was opened in the store space previously occupied by Target.

<text>The Smiths is the debut studio album by English rock band the Smiths, released on 20 February 1984 by Rough Trade Records. After the original production by Troy Tate was felt to be inadequate, John Porter re-recorded the album in London, Manchester and Stockport during breaks in the band&#x27;s UK tour during September 1983.

The album was well received by critics and listeners, and reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, staying on the chart for 33 weeks. It established the Smiths as a prominent band in the 1980s music scene in the United Kingdom. The album also became an international success, peaking at number 45 in the European Albums Chart, remaining in the chart for 21 weeks. After its exit of the European chart, it then re-entered in the Hot 100 Albums from September for another run of three weeks.

==Production==
After signing with independent record label Rough Trade, the Smiths began preparations to record their first album in mid 1983. Due to the suggestion of Rough Trade head Geoff Travis, the band selected Troy Tate (former guitarist of the Teardrop Explodes) as producer for sessions at Elephant studios in Wapping, London. During the following month the group recorded fourteen songs.

Guitarist Johnny Marr would later write in his autobiography that he &quot;liked Troy...Troy&#x27;s vision was to capture the way the band sounded live. He thought it was important that the record represented the way we were in the clubs and was an authentic document. He worked pretty tirelessly to get passion from a performance and was very nurturing with me...&quot; However, the sessions would also prove to be arduous due to an ongoing heatwave in London. The Smiths were recording in a hot basement studio at Elephant, and according to Marr, not only was the heat uncomfortable but it made it difficult to keep their instruments in tune.

While recording a BBC session for Dave Jensen in August 1983, The Smiths met producer John Porter, who was working in one of the studios. Travis, harbouring reservations about the group&#x27;s session with Troy Tate, gave Porter a cassette of the sessions beforehand in the hopes that he could remix them. Porter told Travis that the sessions were &quot;out of tune and out of time&quot;. Feeling the Tate sessions were unsalvageable, Porter offered to re-record the album himself. Despite praising the work with Tate, only a week prior, to the press by stating &quot;we&#x27;ve done everything exactly right and it&#x27;ll show&quot;, Smiths singer Morrissey accepted (as did Travis), while Marr hesitantly agreed. Marr would later claim in his autobiography that when the band heard the finished work done under Tate, Morrissey didn&#x27;t like the album and the others weren&#x27;t entirely happy with the results either. &quot;I could hear myself that the mixes sounded underproduced and were not the finished article that we needed as our introduction to the world,&quot; Marr wrote. &quot;Why it was deemed necessary to scrap the album entirely rather than just mix it again I didn&#x27;t know, but I wasn&#x27;t going to make too much of it...it was a document of how the band really were at that point though...&quot;.

The Smiths began work with Porter in September 1983. Due to tour commitments, the group had to make the record in a piecemeal fashion. Marr later recalled that &quot;working with John immediately got us results...he and I formed a musical and personal relationship that was inspiring...he nurtured not just me but all the band&quot;. Recording started at London&#x27;s Matrix Studios, with the majority of the work undertaken during a week&#x27;s stay at Pluto, just outside Manchester. A final overdub session was performed at Eden Studios in London that November. After listening to a finished mix of the album the following month, Morrissey told Porter and Travis that the album &quot;wasn&#x27;t good enough&quot;. However, the singer said that due to the album&#x27;s cost of £6,000, &quot;[they said] it has to be released, there&#x27;s no going back&quot;.

==Artwork and packaging==

The sleeve for &quot;The Smiths&quot; was designed by Morrissey. It features American actor Joe D&#x27;Allesandro in a cropped still from Andy Warhol&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;Flesh&quot;. The photograph of Morrissey on the original card inner sleeve was taken at an early London concert by Romi Mori, who subsequently played bass guitar for the Gun Club.

==Promotion==
The single &quot;What Difference Does It Make?&quot; was shortened and released in January 1984, reaching number 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Release==
The album was released on 20 February 1984, and debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart.

&quot;This Charming Man&quot; was included as the sixth track on all original US releases of the album on Sire Records (LP, CD and cassette) and on the UK cassette on Rough Trade. Since 1992, when WEA acquired the Smiths&#x27; catalogue, nearly all reissues worldwide also include this song, with the exceptions being a 2009 vinyl reissue on Rhino Records in both the US and the UK and the 2011 vinyl version box set collecting the Smiths albums titled &quot;Complete&quot;.

==Legacy==
The music critic Garry Mulholland included it in his list of the 261 greatest albums since 1976 in &quot;Fear of Music&quot;: &quot;The Smiths made safe their early legend with a debut album about child abuse. The production was flat and dour, yet it succeeded in conjuring yet another Manchester-in-song, distinctly different from that of Ian Curtis and Mark E. Smith. But everything about The Smiths ran contrary to mid-80s pop, from Joe Dallesandro on the cover to the restrained jangling of the songs, but mainly through Moz&#x27;s [Morrissey&#x27;s nickname] dramatised disgust at sex, which here exists to ruin true love at best, and to ruin an entire young life at worst.&quot;

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at 51 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot; saying &quot;There&#x27;s no reason why a mordant, sexually frustrated disciple of Oscar Wilde who loved punk but crooned like a malfunctioning Sinatra should&#x27;ve teamed up with a fabulously inventive guitarist whose influences were so diffuse that it could be hard to hear them at all and formed one of the greatest songwriting duos of the &#x27;80s.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; included the album on their list of &quot;12 Essential Alternative Rock Albums from the 1980s&quot; saying: &quot;Morrissey&#x27;s career are fully accounted for on &quot;The Smiths&quot;, where they are rendered all the more piercing by Johnny Marr&#x27;s delicate guitar-picking and John Porter&#x27;s stark production&quot;.

In 1989, the album was ranked number 22 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest albums of the 1980s. In 2003, the album was #481 on that magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The magazine ranked it at #473 on an updated list in 2012, calling it &quot;a showcase for Morrissey&#x27;s morose wit and Johnny Marr&#x27;s guitar chime&quot;. The album was ranked number 51 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time. It placed at number 73 in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of the 100 Best Albums Ever in 1997.

<doc id="618971" wikidata="Q1737190" url="?curid=618971" title="Causative">
<text>In linguistics, a causative (abbreviated ) is a valency-increasing operation that indicates that a subject either causes someone or something else to do or be something or causes a change in state of a non-volitional event. Normally, it brings in a new argument (the causer), A, into a transitive clause, with the original subject S becoming the object O.

All languages have ways to express causation but differ in the means. Most, if not all, languages have specific or &quot;lexical&quot; causative forms (such as English &quot;rise&quot; → &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;lie&quot; → &quot;lay&quot;, &quot;sit&quot; → &quot;set&quot;). Some languages also have morphological devices (such as inflection) that change verbs into their causative forms or change adjectives into verbs of &quot;becoming&quot;. Other languages employ periphrasis, with control verbs, idiomatic expressions or auxiliary verbs. There tends to be a link between how &quot;compact&quot; a causative device is and its semantic meaning.

The normal English causative verb or control verb used in periphrasis is &quot;make&quot; rather than &quot;cause&quot;. Linguistic terms are traditionally given names with a Romance root, which has led some to believe that &quot;cause&quot; is more prototypical. While &quot;cause&quot; is a causative, it carries some additional meaning (it implies direct causation) and is less common than &quot;make&quot;. Also, while most other English causative verbs require a &quot;to&quot; complement clause (as in &quot;My mom caused me to eat broccoli&quot;), &quot;make&quot; does not require one (&quot;My mom made me eat broccoli&quot;), at least when it is not being used in the passive voice.

==Terminology==
Many authors have written extensively on causative constructions and have used a variety of terms, often to talk about the same things.

S, A, and O are terms used in morphosyntactic alignment to describe arguments in a sentence. The subject of an intransitive verb is S, the agent of a transitive verb is A, and the object of a transitive is O. These terms are technically not abbreviations (anymore) for &quot;subject&quot;, &quot;agent&quot;, and &quot;object&quot;, though they can usually be thought of that way. P is often used instead of O in many works.

The term underlying is used to describe sentences, phrases, or words that correspond to their causative versions. Often, this underlying sentence may not be explicitly stated. For example, for the sentence &quot;&#x27;John made Bill drive the truck&#x27;&quot;, the underlying sentence would be &quot;Bill drove the truck&quot;. This has also been called the base situation.

A derived sentence would be the causativized variant of the underlying sentence.

The causer is the new argument in a causative expression that causes the action to be done. The causer is the new argument brought into a derived sentence. In the example sentence above, &quot;John&quot; is the causer.

The causee is the argument that actually does the action in a causativized sentence. It is usually present in both the underlying and derived sentences. &quot;Bill&quot; is the causee in the above example.

==Devices==
There are various ways of encoding causation, which form somewhat of a continuum of &quot;compactness.&quot;

===Lexical===
Lexical causatives are common in the world&#x27;s languages. There are three kinds of lexical causatives, the unifying factor being that the idea of causation is part of the semantics of the verb itself. (English, for example, employs all three of these kinds of lexical causatives.)

On the surface, lexical causatives look essentially the same as a regular transitive verb. There are a few reasons why this is not true. The first is that transitive verbs generally do not have an intransitive counterpart but lexical causatives do. The semantics of the verbs show the difference as well. A regular transitive verb implies a single event while a lexical causative implies a realization of an event:

:(a) John kicked the ice but nothing happened to it.
:(b) *John melted the ice but nothing happened to it.

Sentence (b) is judged ungrammatical because it goes against the successful event implied by the verb &quot;melt&quot;.

====One word====

Some languages, including English, have ambitransitive verbs like &quot;break&quot;, &quot;burn&quot; or &quot;awake&quot;, which may either be intransitive or transitive (&quot;The vase broke&quot; vs. &quot;I broke the vase.&quot;)

These are split into two varieties: agentive and patientive ambitransitives. Agentive ambitransitives (also called S=A ambitransitives) include verbs such as &quot;walk&quot; and &quot;knit&quot; because the S of the intransitive corresponds to the A of the transitive. For example:

:(1a) &quot;Mary&quot; (S) &quot;is knitting.&quot;

:(1b) &quot;Mary&quot; (A) &quot;is knitting a scarf&quot; (O).

This type of ambitransitive does &quot;not&quot; show a causative relationship.

For patientive ambitransitives (also called S=O ambitransitives), such as &quot;trip&quot; and &quot;spill&quot;, the S of the intransitive corresponds to the O of the transitive:

:(2a) &quot;The milk &quot; (S) &quot;spilled.&quot;

:(2b) &quot;Jim&quot; (A) &quot;spilled the milk&quot; (O).

These are further divided into two more types, based on speakers&#x27; intuition. Some, like &quot;spill&quot; in (2), are primarily transitive and secondarily intransitive. Other verbs like this include &quot;smash&quot; and &quot;extend.&quot; Other verbs, such as &quot;trip&quot; in (3) go the other way: they are primarily intransitive and secondarily transitive.

:(3a) &quot;John&quot; (S) &quot;tripped.&quot;

:(3b) &quot;Mary&quot; (A) &quot;tripped John&quot; (O).

Other examples of this type include &quot;explode&quot;, &quot;melt&quot;, &quot;dissolve&quot;, &quot;walk&quot;, and &quot;march&quot;. It is this type of ambitransitive verb that is considered a causative. This is given some anecdotal evidence in that to translate (3b) above into languages with morphological causatives, a morpheme would need to be attached to the verb.

Lexical causatives are apparently constrained to involving only one agentive argument. Semantically, the causer is usually marked as the patient. In fact, it is unlikely whether any language has a lexical causative for verbs such as &quot;swim&quot;, &quot;sing&quot;, &quot;read&quot;, or &quot;kick&quot;.

====Irregular stem change====
English &quot;fell&quot; (as in &quot;Paul felled the tree&quot;) can be thought of as a lexical causative of &quot;fall&quot; (&quot;the tree fell&quot;), exemplifying this category. This is considered a lexical change because it is not at all productive. If it were productive, it would be an internal change morphological causative (below).

====Two words====
English has verb pairs such as &quot;rise&quot; and &quot;raise&quot;, &quot;eat&quot; and &quot;feed&quot;, &quot;see&quot; and &quot;show&quot; where one is essentially the causative correspondent of the other.

These pairs are linked semantically by various means, usually involving translation. For example, &quot;burn&quot; as in &quot;The grass burned&quot; (intransitive) would translate as &quot;awa-&quot; in Yimas, while &quot;burn&quot; as in &quot;I burned the grass&quot; (transitive) would translate as &quot;ampu-&quot; in Yimas.

===Morphological===

There are eight different morphological processes by which a causative may be marked, roughly organized by compactness:

Within morphological causatives, this degree of compactness bears an important variable when considering the semantics of the two processes. For example, mechanisms that do not change the length of the word (internal change, tone change) are shorter than those that lengthen it. Of those that lengthen it, shorter changes are more compact than longer.

Verbs can be classified into four categories, according to how susceptible they are to morphological causativization:
# Inactive intransitives (&quot;faint&quot;)
# Middle/ingestive verbs (either intransitive or transitive such as &quot;sit down&quot;, &quot;ascend&quot;, &quot;put clothes on&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;, or &quot;learn&quot;)
# Active intransitives (&quot;work&quot;)
# Transitive verbs (&quot;carry&quot;)

This hierarchy has some exceptions, but it does generally hold true. For example, given a text of Guarani, only about 16% of causatives apply to transitives. For some languages, it may not apply to transitive verbs productively and may only apply to verbs that denote abstract action or consumption of food. Additionally, within Athabaskan family, all languages can causativize inactive intransitives, but not all of them can causativize active intransitives or even transitives.

===Two verbs in one predicate===
A number of languages involve a form of analytic causative that involves two verbs in a single predicate, such as French, Spanish, Italian and Catalan. For example, when French &quot;faire&quot; is used as a causative, the causee noun phrase cannot occur between it and the next verb.

Unlike most other Romance languages, Portuguese uses a periphrastic construction like that of English, discussed below.

Kiowa uses a similar mechanism. Verbs can be compounded with the transitive verb &quot;ɔ́m&quot; to create a causative:

===Periphrastic constructions===
Some languages use a periphrastic (or analytic) construction to express causation and typically include two verbs and two clauses. English causatives prototypically use &quot;make&quot; (but other verbs such as &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;order&quot;, &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;force&quot;, &quot;compel&quot; can be used) in the main clause with the lexical verb in a subordinate clause, as in &quot;I made him go.&quot;

Other languages, such as Persian, have the opposite syntax: the causative is in a subordinating clause and the main verb is in the main clause, as in the following example from Macushi:

Canela-Krahô has a combination of the two in which the causee is marked twice, once in each clause:

Portuguese also has a periphrastic construction like that of English but unlike most other Romance languages:

Analytic causatives are sometimes not considered to be valency increasing devices, but they can semantically be interpreted as such.

==Semantics==
A language may have one or more different formal mechanisms for expression of causation. For languages with only one, the semantic range is broad. For those with multiple, there is always a semantic difference between the two. R. M. W. Dixon breaks down these semantic differences into 9 parameters, involving the verb itself, the causee, and the causer:

:(a) Parameters that relate to the verb itself
::*1. State/Action: Can the causative apply to state and process verbs or does it apply to action verbs?
::*2. Transitivity: Does the causative apply to only intransitives, to intransitives and some transitives, or to all verbs? 
:(b) Parameters that relate to the thing being caused (the original S or A)
::*3. Control: Does the causee have control of the activity?
::*4. Volition: Does the causee do the action willingly or unwillingly?
::*5. Affectedness: Is the causee completely or partially affected?
:(c) Parameters that relate to the causer (the new A in a causative construction)
::*6. Directness: Does the causer act directly or indirectly?
::*7. Intention: Is the result achieved accidentally or intentionally?
::*8. Naturalness: Does the activity happen fairly naturally or is it with effort, violence, or force?
::*9. Involvement: How involved was the causer in the activity?

These parameters are not mutually exclusive. Many causative constructions involve the semantics of two or more parameters. However, the difference between the causatives in a language most likely will be distinguished by one of the parameters.

==Relationship between devices and semantics==

===Animacy of the object===

There is a strong correlation between the semantics of a causative and the mechanism by which it is expressed. Generally, if a causative is more &quot;compact&quot; than another, it usually implies a more direct causation.

For inanimate and unconscious objects, English analytic causatives (1–3) are therefore not completely synonymous with lexical causatives (4–6):

# &quot;I made the tree fall.&quot;
# &quot;I made the chicken die.&quot;
# &quot;I made the cup rise to my lips.&quot;
# &quot;I felled the tree.&quot;
# &quot;I killed the chicken.&quot;
# &quot;I raised the cup to my lips.&quot;

Analytic causatives (1–3) imply that no physical contact was involved and therefore was done by some sort of magical power or telekinesis. Lexical causatives (4–6) do not imply that meaning.

For animate and conscious objects, there is a different difference in meaning:

# &quot;He caused them to lie down.&quot;
# &quot;He laid them down.&quot;

(1) makes sense only if &quot;they&quot; are animate and awake. Barring magic, (2) makes sense only if the object is inanimate or unconscious.

===Finite and non-finite verbs===
Generally, the larger the distance between the causer and the causee, the more finite the verb is. Consider the following examples from Spanish:

The first example implies that Montezuma was physically there and was directly involved in making Cortés eat bread. The second example implies that Montezuma was not physically there and arranged for something to happen to make Cortés eat bread, perhaps by killing all of his cattle. That could approximate the English construction &quot;Montezuma got Cortés to eat bread.&quot; Therefore, at least in Spanish, a conjugated verb implies a less direct causation.

===Dixon&#x27;s prototypes===
Dixon examines this correlation cross-linguistically, and summarizes his findings in the following table. In this table, L refers to lexical causatives, M1 refers to more compact morphological processes while M2 refers to less compact processes, CP refers to complex predicates (two verbs, one predicate), and P refers to periphrastic constructions. These processes are explained more clearly in the devices section above.

Parameter 9, Involvement, cannot be included in the table because the only two languages with this distinction, Nomatsiguenga and Kamayurá, the morphemes are about the same length. When a larger sample of languages show this distinction, perhaps this parameter can be included in the table.

The table shows that for each of eight semantic parameters outlined in the semantics section above, more compact causative processes show one distinction while less compact processes show the other distinction. For example, Parameter 6 distinguishes between more direct and less direct causation. In Hindi, M1, or the shorter morphological process, shows direct causation while M2, the longer morphological process, shows indirect causation.

Summarizing the table, Dixon has given two prototypes for causatives:

:Prototype 1
::*Causer achieves the result natural, intentionally, and directly
::*Causee either lacking control or being willing and may be partially affected
::*Less transitive verbs affected
:Prototype 2
::*Causer achieves the result accidentally, with effort, or acts indirectly
::*Causee is in control but unwilling and is completely affected.
::*More likely to apply to all types of verbs

All eight of the components in each prototype are never attested in a single causative. However, a single process may have two or three components. Dixon admits to these being very tentative and in need for further investigation.

==Syntax==
R.M.W. Dixon also outlines the syntactic possibilities of causatives in the world&#x27;s languages.

===Intransitives===
Since intransitive verbs have low valency, virtually any type of causative construction can apply to them productively within a language. Some constructions are &quot;only&quot; allowed with intransitive verbs and some languages (such as Arabic, Blackfoot, and Gothic) only allow causatives of intransitive verbs, with some exceptions. In all cases, the original subject of the underlying intransitive verb corresponds with the object of the derived transitive verb. All languages have this construction, though some allow a semantic difference if the original subject is marked differently (such as Japanese and Hungarian).

For split systems, causatives of intransitives may be treated differently.

The syntax of a causative construction is almost always the same as some other type of sentence, such as a sentence with a transitive verb. Tariana, however, is an exception to this rule.

===Transitives===
In the causative of a transitive verb, the new causer always becomes the new A of the sentence. What happens to the causee and the original object depend on the language. Dixon shows that there are five main types of situations:

Within type (v) there are two main subtypes. Either the original A goes into the first empty slot in a hierarchy or it always takes a certain function.

For the first subtype, there is a hierarchy involved in the language:

:subject &gt; direct object &gt; indirect object &gt; oblique &gt; genitive &gt; object of comparison.

French is a language that follows this hierarchy. When a causative is employed, the original A does not get marked the same for intransitives, transitives, and ditransitives. In this first example, the verb in intransitive, and with the subject slot taken, the original A becomes a direct object:

The following example has a transitive verb. The subject and direct object slots are filled (with &quot;je&quot; and &quot;les gâteaux&quot;, respectively) so the original A becomes an indirect object:

This final French example has a ditransitive verb. The subject is &quot;je&quot;, the direct object is &quot;une lettre&quot;, and the indirect object is &quot;directeur&quot;, so the original A is marked as an oblique:

While some writers have called this hierarchical causative construction the norm, outside of Romance languages it is in fact rather rare.

Most other languages are of the second subtype of type (v), and the original A takes on a set case or marking, regardless whether the underlying verb is intransitive or transitive:

===Ditransitives===

The syntactic and morphological constraints of individual language generally restrict causatives of ditransitive verbs. The underlying phrase already contains an A, O, and indirect object, and so in order to accommodate a fourth argument, languages employ a variety of constructions. They tend to be idiosyncratic and are difficult to group together into types. Additionally, data is patchy for many languages since descriptions of languages seldom include information of causatives of ditransitives.

===Double causatives===

Some types of causative constructions essentially do not permit double causatives, &quot;e.g.&quot; it would be difficult to find a lexical double causative. Periphrastic causatives however, have the potential to always be applied iteratively (&quot;Mom made Dad make my brother make his friends leave the house.&quot;).

Many Indo-Aryan languages (such as Hindustani) have lexical double causatives.

For morphological causatives, some languages do not allow single morpheme to be applied twice on a single verb (Jarawara) while others do (Capanawa, Hungarian, Turkish, Kabardian, Karbi), though sometimes with an idiomatic meaning (Swahili&#x27;s means &quot;force to do&quot; and Oromo&#x27;s carries an intensive meaning). Other languages, such as Nivkh, have two different morphological mechanisms that can apply to a single verb. Still others have one morpheme that applies to intransitives and another to transitives (Apalai, Guarani). All of these examples apply to underlying intransitive verbs, yielding a ditransitive verb. So far, there are no reliable data for a morphological double causative of a transitive verb, resulting in a verb with four arguments.

==Other topics==

===Causative (repetitive)===
Yokuts, an indigenous language spoken in California, has a morpheme, &quot;-lsaˑ&quot;, that indicates causation in addition to repetition. This is separate from the language&#x27;s normal mechanisms of causation.

This implies a single act by the causer, but multiple acts by the causee.

===Causative voice===

The causative voice is a grammatical voice promoting the oblique argument of a transitive verb to an actor argument. When the causative voice is applied to a verb, its valency increases by one. If, after the application of the grammatical voice, there are two actor arguments, one of them is obligatorily demoted to an oblique argument.

Japanese, Turkish and Mongolian are examples of languages with the causative voice. The following are examples from Japanese:



===Causal case===

The causal or causative case (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case that indicates that the marked noun is the cause or reason for something. It is found in the Dravidian languages Kannada and Telugu, the Native South American language Quechua, and Northeast Caucasian Archi. It is also found in extinct Tocharian B, an Indo-European language.

===Causal-final case===

The causal-final is a grammatical case in Hungarian (and Chuvash) expressing the meaning &#x27;for the purpose of, for the reason that&#x27;, and denoting price asked of or paid for goods. It is formed by adding the ending suffix &quot;-ért&quot; to the end of the noun, e.g. &quot;kenyér&quot; &quot;bread&quot; &gt;&quot;kenyérért&quot; &quot;for bread&quot;, e.g. &quot;elküldtem a boltba kenyérért&quot; &quot;I sent him to the store for bread&quot;. It is not affected by vowel harmony in Hungarian.

==Literature==

===Shibatani===
Shibatani lists three criteria for entities and relations that must be encoded in linguistic expressions of causation:
# An agent causing or forcing another participant to perform an action, or to be in a certain condition
# The relation between [the] two events [=the causing event, and the caused performing/being event] is such that the speaker believes that the occurrence of one event, the ‟caused event,&quot; has been realized at t2, which is after t1, the time of the ‟causing event&quot;
# The relation between causing event and caused event is such that the speaker believes the occurrence of the caused event depends wholly on the occurrence of the causing event—the dependency of the two events here must be to the extent that it allows the speaker a counterfactual inference that the caused event would not have taken place at a particular time if the causing event had not taken place, provided that all else had remained the same.

This set of definitional prerequisites allows for a broad set of types of relationships based, at least, on the lexical verb, the semantics of the causer, the semantics of the causee and the semantics of the construction explicitly encoding the causal relationship. Many analysts (Comrie (1981), Song (1996), Dixon (2000) and others) have worked to tease apart what factors (semantic or otherwise) account for the distribution of causative constructions, as well as to document what patterns actually occur cross-linguistically.

===Comrie===
Bernard Comrie focuses on the typology of the syntax and semantics of causative constructions proper. Crucially, Comrie (and others to be discussed here) distinguish between the linguistic encoding of causal relations and other extra-linguistic concerns such as the nature of causation itself and questions of how humans perceive of causal relations. While certainly not irrelevant, these extra-linguistic questions will, for now, be left aside. Comrie usefully characterizes causative events in terms of two (or more) microevents perceived of composing a macroevent, and encoded in a single expression (of varying size and form). Formally, he categorizes causatives into 3 types, depending on the contiguity of the material encoding the causing event and that encoding the caused event. These are: 1) lexical causatives, in which the two events are expressed in a single lexical item, as in the well-discussed case of English kill; 2) morphological causatives, in which the causing event and the caused event are encoded in a single verbal complex via causative morphology, and, prototypically, morphological marking showing the status of affected arguments. Finally, Comrie discusses analytic causatives, in which the causing event and the caused event are encoded in separate clauses.

Comrie&#x27;s work is also noteworthy for having brought the notion of syntactic hierarchy to bear on the typology of causative constructions. A hierarchy of grammatical relations had already been formulated to help explain possibilities for relative clause formation (first presented as Keenan and Comrie&#x27;s (1972) NP accessibility hierarchy; see Croft 1990: 147), and Comrie argued that a similar hierarchy was in play, at least in some constructions, in the marking of the original A argument when a base transitive clause is causativized. The hierarchy is as follows:
*subject &gt; direct object &gt; indirect object &gt; oblique &gt; genitive
Comrie&#x27;s argument was, in short, that some causativized-transitive constructions mark the new A as belonging to the leftmost available slot in the above hierarchy. Dixon (2000) fleshes out a version this analysis in more detail.

===Song===
Presenting a typology of causatives and causation based on a database of 600 languages, Song is very critical of typological work that depends on statistical inference, citing data from the Niger-Congo family that contradicts some earlier claims that &quot;languages within genera are generally fairly similar typologically&quot;. Song therefore culls data from every language for which adequate documentation is available to him, and categorizes the various causative constructions gleaned therefrom into three classes: COMPACT, AND and PURP.

Song employs the following terminology:
*[Scause] – the clause which denotes a causing event
*[Seffect] – the clause which denotes the caused event
*[Vcause] – verbal elements of [Scause]
*[Veffect]- verbal elements of [Seffect]

The major differences between Song&#x27;s analysis and Comrie (1981) and Dixon (2000), is that Song lumps the range of lexical and morphological causatives together under the label COMPACT, in which [Vcause] can be &quot;less than a free morpheme&quot; (e.g., bound morpheme [prefix, suffix, infix, circumfix, reduplication], zero-derivation, suppletion); or &quot;a free morpheme&quot;, in which [Vcause] and [Veffect] form a single grammatical unit. Most of the examples given look like serial verb constructions, and no in-depth analysis is undertaken for some of the constructions in which [Vcause] and [Veffect] are less formally contiguous. Song notes this non-contiguity, but does not undertake to explain why it might be important.

The AND causative, for Song, is any construction with a separate [Scause] and [Seffect] i.e., in which &quot;two clauses [are] involved&quot;. This, in theory, could include larger, multi-clausal expressions of causal relations which many analysts probably would not label a &#x27;causative construction&#x27;, e.g.: &#x27;It rained yesterday, so they stayed home&#x27;, but the boundaries of the AND causative category are not discussed.

One of Song&#x27;s major contributions to the literature is fleshing out an analysis of his PURP causative. These are constructions which encode intended causation on the part of the causer, but which do not encode any outcome: i.e., the speaker encodes [Vcause] and causer intentionality, but remains agnostic as to whether [Veffect] was felicitously effected.

===Talmy===
Leonard Talmy conducts an in-depth investigation of different types of causal relations. Talmy refers to these as &quot;lexicalization patterns,&quot; a term which remains unclear to me, given that few of the examples given in his discussion are lexical items, and most interpretations of &quot;different types of causation incorporated in the verb root&quot; are in fact wholly dependent on other morphosyntactic material in the clause. Let us first examine his list of possible (semantic) causative types, with examples:
*autonomous events (non-causative) &quot;The vase broke.&quot;
*resulting-event causation &quot;The vase broke from a ball&#x27;s rolling into it.&quot;
*causing-event causation &quot;A ball&#x27;s rolling into it broke the vase.&quot;
*instrument causation &quot;A ball broke the vase.&quot;
*author causation (unintended) &quot;I broke the vase in rolling a ball into it.&quot;
*agent causation (intended) &quot;I broke the vase by rolling a ball into it.&quot;
*undergoer situation (non-causative) &quot;My arm broke (on me) when I fell.&quot;
*self-agentive causation &quot;I walked to the store.&quot;
*caused agency (inductive causation) &quot;I sent him to the store.&quot;

One question remaining to be explored is how this set of divisions usefully differs from other analysts&#x27; typologies of the semantics of encoding causal relations. Some overlap in the types of semantic information in play is immediately apparent, however: in cases of instrument causation (&#x27;the hammer broke the cup&#x27;), we would certainly expect the &#x27;causer&#x27; to be acting directly [Dixon&#x27;s criterion 6] and to be involved in the activity [criterion 9]; likewise, we would expect instances of caused agency to include more information on causee control on willingness [criteria 3 &amp; 4].

==Indo-European languages==
===Germanic languages===
====Proto-Germanic====
In Proto-Germanic, the parent language of Germanic languages such as English, causative verbs are formed by adding a suffix &quot;-j/ij-&quot; to the past-tense ablaut of a strong verb, with Verner&#x27;s Law voicing applied. (All of those characteristics derive from the way that causative verbs are formed in Proto-Indo-European, with an accented &quot;-éy-&quot; suffix added to the &quot;o&quot;-grade of a non-derived verb.) Here are some examples:

*&quot;*rīsaną&quot; (I) &quot;to rise&quot; → &quot;*raizijaną&quot; &quot;to raise&quot;, i.e. &quot;to cause to rise&quot;
*&quot;*frawerþaną&quot; (III) &quot;to perish&quot; → &quot;*frawardijaną&quot; &quot;to destroy&quot;, i.e. &quot;to cause to perish&quot;
*&quot;*nesaną&quot; (V) &quot;to survive&quot; → &quot;*nazjaną&quot; &quot;to save&quot;, i.e. &quot;to cause to survive&quot;
*&quot;*ligjaną&quot; (V) &quot;to lie down&quot; → &quot;*lagjaną&quot; &quot;to lay&quot;: &quot;to cause to lie down&quot;
*&quot;*grētaną&quot; (VII) &quot;to weep&quot; → &quot;*grōtijaną&quot; &quot;to cause to weep&quot;

In English, &quot;to sit&quot;/&quot;to seat&quot;&quot;, and in German, 
&quot;sitzen&quot;/&quot;setzen&quot; form pairs of resultative/causative.

====English====
English uses various causative mechanisms, with varying degrees of productivity. There are a large number of lexical causatives, such as &quot;kill&quot;, &quot;open&quot; and &quot;feed&quot;.

Additionally, there are several morphemes that can express causation. For example, &quot;-(i)fy&quot; can be thought of as a causative in that it is a derivation that turns an adjective or noun into a &quot;verb of becoming&quot;:

*&quot;simple&quot; → &quot;simplify&quot; = &quot;to make simple&quot;, &quot;to cause (something) to become simple&quot;
*&quot;object&quot; → &quot;objectify&quot; = &quot;to make into an object&quot;, &quot;to cause (something) to become an object&quot; (figuratively, that is)

&quot;en-&quot; can also be a causative. In English, adjectives (or &quot;stative verbs&quot; in other languages) can express the acquisition of a quality or changes of state with causatives, in the same way as with regular verbs. For example, if there is a stative verb &quot;to be large&quot;, the causative will mean &quot;to enlarge&quot;, &quot;to make grow&quot;. The reflexive form of the causative can then be used to mean &quot;to enlarge oneself&quot;, or even as a middle voice, &quot;to grow&quot;.

As far as lexical causatives are concerned, English has at least 49 causative verbs. Roughly half affect only sentient beings: &quot;allow&quot;, &quot;block&quot;, &quot;cause&quot;, &quot;enable&quot;, &quot;force&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;help&quot;, &quot;hinder&quot;, &quot;hold&quot;, &quot;impede&quot;, &quot;keep&quot;, &quot;leave&quot;, &quot;let&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, &quot;permit&quot;, &quot;prevent&quot;, &quot;protect&quot;, &quot;restrain&quot;, &quot;save&quot;, &quot;set&quot;, &quot;start&quot;, &quot;stimulate&quot;, &quot;stop&quot;. The others can affect either sentient or non-sentient beings: &quot;aid&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;bribe&quot;, &quot;compel&quot;, &quot;constrain&quot;, &quot;convince&quot;, &quot;deter&quot;, &quot;discourage&quot;, &quot;dissuade&quot;, &quot;drive&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, &quot;hamper&quot;, &quot;impel&quot;, &quot;incite&quot;, &quot;induce&quot;, &quot;influence&quot;, &quot;inspire&quot;, &quot;lead&quot;, &quot;move&quot;, &quot;persuade&quot;, &quot;prompt&quot;, &quot;push&quot;, &quot;restrict&quot;, &quot;rouse&quot;, &quot;send&quot;, &quot;spur&quot;.

===Sanskrit===
In Sanskrit, there is a causative form of the verb (&quot;ṇijanta&quot;), which is used when the subject of a clause forces or makes the object perform an action. The causative suffix &quot;-ay&quot; is attached to the verbal root, which may cause vowel sandhi to take place:

*&quot;bhū&quot; &quot;to be, exist&quot; → &quot;bhāv-ay&quot;; for example, &quot;bhāvayati&quot; &quot;he causes to be&quot;
*&quot;khad&quot; &quot;to eat&quot; → &quot;khād-ay&quot;; for example, &quot;khādayāmi&quot; &quot;I cause to eat&quot; = &quot;I feed&quot;

===Persian===
In Persian, the causative form of the verb is formed by adding &quot;ân(i)dan&quot; to the present stem:

*&quot;xordan&quot; (to eat) → &quot;xor&quot; (present stem) → &quot;xorândan&quot; (to cause/make to eat)
*&quot;xandidan&quot; (to laugh) → &quot;xand&quot; (present stem) → &quot;xandândan&quot; (to cause/make to laugh)

===Lithuanian===
In Lithuanian, the causative form of the verb is made by adding suffix &quot;-(d)in-&quot; to the present stem:

*&quot;skraidyti&quot; (to fly) → &quot;skraidinti&quot; (to make to fly)
*&quot;sėdėti&quot; (to sit) → &quot;sodinti&quot; (to make to sit)
*&quot;juoktis&quot; (to laugh) → &quot;juokinti&quot; (to make to laugh)
*&quot;plaukti&quot; (to swim) → &quot;plaukdinti&quot; (to make to swim)
*&quot;šokti&quot; (to dance) → &quot;šokdinti&quot; (to make to dance)

===Latin===
The topic of causatives has not been studied much for Latin, mainly because of its lack of productive morphological causative.

===Hindustani===

Hindustani uses the infix &quot;-(l)ā-&quot; and &quot;-(l)vā-&quot; to make verbs causative.
*&quot;karnā&quot; &quot;to do&quot; → &quot;karānā&quot; &quot;to have done&quot; → &quot;karvānā&quot; → &quot;to have someone make someone do.&quot;
*&quot;paṛhnā&quot; &quot;to read&quot; → &quot;paṛhānā&quot; &quot;to make someone read&quot; → &quot;paṛhvānā&quot; &quot;to cause someone to make someone read.&quot;
*&quot;hilnā&quot; &quot;to move&quot; → &quot;hilānā&quot; &quot;to have something moved&quot; → &quot;hilvānā&quot; &quot;to have someone make something move.&quot;
*&quot;pīnā&quot; &quot;to drink&quot; → &quot;pilānā&quot; &quot;to have someone drink&quot; → &quot;pilvānā&quot; &quot;to have someone make someone drink&quot;: &quot;Usne naukrānī se bachchõ-ko pānī &quot;pilvāyā&quot;&quot; - &quot;She had the maid make the kids drink water.&quot;

===Bengali===
The causative verbs are called () in Bengali. In the simplest way, the causative form of a verb can be formed by adding the suffix with the verbal noun form of the given verb.
* &#x27;to see&#x27; → &#x27;to show/to cause someone to see&#x27;.
* &#x27;to eat&#x27; → &#x27;to feed/to cause someone to eat&#x27;.

From the verbal root ( in Bengali) perspective, the formation of causatives is done by adding the suffix with the verb roots ending with a consonant, and the suffix with those roots ending with a vowel. Thus, the verbal root transformations of the two previously mentioned verbs are:
* → 
These verb roots are thereafter inflected with tense, aspect and mood.

== Basque ==
The Basque language has two ways to form causative verbs: by using a non-ergative transitive verb in the absolute form, or by the morphological causativization. The first method is only possible with a restricted set of verbs which excludes those whose subjects take the ergative case, such as the verb &quot;eztul egin&quot; (cough -- literally &quot;make (a) cough&quot;).

==Turkish==
In addition to very productive morphological causatives, Turkish also has some lexical causatives: &quot;kır-&quot; &quot;break&quot;, &quot;yırt-&quot; &quot;split&quot;, &quot;dik-&quot; &quot;plant&quot;, &quot;yak-&quot; &quot;burn&quot;, &quot;sakla-&quot; &quot;hide&quot;, &quot;aç-&quot; &quot;open&quot;.

==Semitic languages==
In most Semitic languages, there is a causative form of the verb. It is postulated that in Proto-Semitic, the causative verbal stem was formed by the &quot;š-&quot; prefix, which has become &quot;ʾa-&quot;, &quot;hi-&quot; or &quot;ī-&quot; in different languages.
*Syriac: &quot;kəθav&quot; &quot;he wrote&quot; → &quot;ʾaxtev&quot; &quot;he composed&quot;
*Arabic: &quot;ʿalima&quot; &quot;he knew&quot; → &quot;ʾaʿlama&quot; &quot;he informed&quot;
*Hebrew: &quot;ṣaħak&quot; &quot;he laughed&quot; → &quot;hiṣħik&quot; &quot;he made someone laugh&quot;

Arabic also has a causative form (Form II) created by gemination of the central consonant of the triliteral root, as follows:
* &quot;ʿalima&quot; &quot;he knew&quot; → &quot;ʿallama&quot; &quot;he taught&quot;

The &quot;ʾa-&quot; form (Form IV), while it is used in Modern Standard Arabic, is no longer productive in many of the colloquial varieties of Arabic, which uniformly prefer Form II.

==Japanese==
Japanese has lexical forms and a morphological device to signify causation. Lexical forms come in pairs of intransitive and transitive verbs, where the causee is mostly inanimate.

*&quot;ochiru&quot; &quot;to fall&quot; → &quot;otosu&quot; &quot;to drop (something) or to let fall&quot;

However, both intransitive and transitive verbs can form the causative in a mostly regular pattern, now with the causee being mostly animate:

*&quot;hairu&quot; &quot;to go in&quot; → &quot;hairaseru&quot; &quot;to let or force (someone) in&quot;
*&quot;ireru&quot; &quot;to put in&quot; → &quot;iresaseru&quot; &quot;to let or force (someone) put (something) in&quot;

In the context of an intransitive verb, the syntax of Japanese causatives allows a two-way distinction in the causee&#x27;s willingness to perform the action. If the new object is marked in the accusative case (&quot;o&quot;), it suggests that the causee did the action willingly, suggesting the agent allowed or requested the action rather than forcing or demanding it. However, if the object is marked in the dative case (&quot;ni&quot;), it expresses the idea that the causee was forced to perform the action. With a transitive verb, this contrast is not directly visible as a clause cannot contain two noun phrases marked as accusative.

==Khmer==
Khmer has six prefixes and one infix to derive the causative form of verbs, but they vary in frequency and productiveness. The consonantal prefix &quot;p-&quot; is one of them:

*&quot;coap&quot; &quot;joined&quot; → &quot;pcoap&quot; &quot;to join&quot;
*&quot;cum&quot; &quot;around&quot; → &quot;pcum&quot; &quot;to gather&quot;

==Uralic languages==

===Finnish===
Causative forms are also found in the Uralic languages of Europe, such as Finnish:
* &quot;syödä&quot; &quot;to eat&quot; → &quot;syöttää&quot; &quot;to feed&quot;
* &quot;täysi&quot; &quot;full&quot; → &quot;täyttää&quot; &quot;to fill&quot;
* &quot;haihtua&quot; &quot;to evaporate&quot; → &quot;haihduttaa&quot; &quot;to vaporize&quot;

The causative suffix is often used irregularly and/or because of historical reasons, as the following Finnish examples:
* &quot;olla&quot; &quot;to be&quot; → &quot;olettaa&quot; &quot;to assume&quot;, not &quot;to make exist&quot;
* &quot;kirja-&quot; ancient &quot;patterns (of embroidery or text)&quot; but modern &quot;book&quot; → &quot;kirjoittaa&quot; &quot;to write&quot; (&quot;transform into patterns of text&quot;), not &quot;to transform into books&quot;

===Hungarian===
Hungarian marks the original subject of an intransitive differently in causative forms to convey direct causation. If the causee is marked by the accusative case, a more direct causation is implied than if the instrumental case is used.

==Austronesian languages==
===Māori===
In Māori, an Austronesian language, the &quot;whaka-&quot; prefix can be added to a verb:
* &quot;ako&quot; &quot;to learn&quot; becomes &quot;whakaako&quot; &quot;to teach&quot; (to cause to learn)

===Philippine languages===
In Philippine languages such as Tagalog and Ilokano, the &quot;pa-&quot; prefix is added to verbal forms and to adjectives to form causatives:
* &quot;dakkel&quot; &quot;big (adjective)&quot; → &quot;padakkelen&quot; &quot;to enlarge&quot; (Ilokano)
* &quot;kain&quot; &quot;eat&quot; → &quot;pakainin&quot; &quot;to make eat, to feed&quot; (Tagalog)

===Malay===
In Malay/Indonesian, causatives are formed from the prefix &quot;per-&quot; (it becomes &quot;memper-&quot; after actor focus/active prefix &quot;meng-&quot;, expected &quot;*memer-&quot; as in &quot;*memerhatikan&quot; found informally). While most languages uses their causative affix for derivational purposes, it has integrated to Malay verb inflection system.
* &quot;baik&quot; &quot;good&quot; → &quot;memperbaiki&quot; (+ local transitive suffix &quot;-i&quot;) &quot;to fix something&quot;
* &quot;baru&quot; &quot;new&quot; → &quot;memperbarui&quot; (+ local transitive suffix &quot;-i&quot;) &quot;to renew/update something&quot;

==Guaraní==
In Guaraní, there are three causatives: one for transitive verbs and two for intransitive verbs. In some texts, the first one is called &quot;coactive.&quot;

The &quot;-uka&quot; suffix (or one of its allomorphes: &quot;-yka&quot;, &quot;-ka&quot;) is added to transitive verbs:
* &quot;ajapo&quot; &quot;I make&quot; → &quot;japouka&quot; &quot;I make (someone) do&quot;.

The &quot;mbo-&quot; prefix is added to intransitive oral verbs and is replaced by &quot;mo-&quot; for nasal verbs:
* &quot;puka&quot; &quot;to laugh&quot; → &quot;mbopuka&quot; &quot;to make (someone) laugh&quot;
* &quot;guata&quot; &quot;to walk&quot; → &quot;mboguata&quot; &quot;to guide&quot;
* &quot;pu&#x27;ã&quot; &quot;to go up&quot; → &quot;mopu&#x27;ã&quot; &quot;to elevate&quot;

The &quot;guero-&quot; (&quot;rero-&quot; or just &quot;ro-&quot;) prefix can also be added to intransitive verbs. It has a comitative meaning and translates roughly as &quot;to cause something or someone to participate in an action with the subject:&quot;

* &quot;guata&quot; &quot;to walk&quot; → &quot;roguata&quot; &quot;to make (someone) take a walk with (the subject)&quot;

The same root (&quot;guata&quot;) can take both causatives but with different meanings.

==Uto-Aztecan languages==
===Classical Nahuatl===
Classical Nahuatl, in the Uto-Aztecan language family, has a well-developed morphological system of expressing causation by means of the suffix &quot;-tia&quot;:
* &quot;tlacua&quot; &quot;he eats something&quot; → &quot;quitlacualtia&quot; &quot;he feeds him/her/it something&quot; the causative makes the intransitive verb &quot;eat something&quot; into the bitransitive verb &quot;feed someone something,&quot; requiring a pronominal prefix, in this case &quot;qui-&quot; &quot;him/her/it&quot;)
Causativity is often used in honorific speech in Classical Nahuatl, and rather than simply &quot;doing,&quot; the honored person &quot;causes himself to do.&quot;

==Athabaskan languages==
Rice makes the following points about morphological causatives in Athabaskan languages:

*In all Athabaskan languages surveyed [including Hupa, for which an ample data set is presented], the causativizing morphology can causativize at least some intransitive verbs with patientive subjects.
*For intransitive verbs with agentive patients, the family shows a split: only some languages then allow morphological causativization.
*Koyukon (Northern Athabaskan; Alaska) was found to be the only language in the survey allowing productive morphological causativization of transitive verbs.
*Perhaps the presence of the direct object pronoun in the causative construction has something to do with whether the causee is human or animate or is capable of being regarded as such. When the causee or the verb cannot be or is not perceived as a potential controller, the pronoun is not found [in the Athabaskan languages surveyed].

The semantic factor of causee control, or the degree of control that that causee wields over the effecting of the caused microevent (also discussed as parameter #3 on Dixon&#x27;s (2000:62) list) and which Rice (2001) finds to be a major factor in other Athabaskan causatives helps account for much of the distribution of the Hupa syntactic causative (below).

===Hupa===
Golla, in his (1970) descriptive grammar of Hupa (summarized in Sapir and Golla (2001)), describes three classes of morphologically derived causatives:

# causatives from descriptive neuters with ƚ-classifier (176)
#: &quot;ni-whon’&quot; &#x27;be good, beautiful&#x27; → &quot;O ni-(w)-ƚ-whon’&quot; &#x27;cause O to be beautiful&#x27;
# causatives from primary extension neuters with ƚ- classifier (76-77, 201)
#: &quot;na-…‘a’&quot; &#x27;O hangs&#x27; → &quot;na-O-ƚ-‘a’&quot; &#x27;hang O up&#x27;
# causatives from primary intransitive action themes (76-77, 204)
#: &quot;ti-ch’id&quot; &#x27;grow tired&#x27; → &quot;O-ti-ƚ-ch’id&quot; &#x27;tire O out&#x27;

While Golla does not generalize about the semantics of verb themes that are compatible with causative ƚ-, several preliminary generalizations can be made. Firstly, in the three cases described by Golla, O [the undergoer] is neither controlling nor agentive; O is largely patientive in all cases. Secondly, the causer appears to be acting directly on O. Thirdly, none of the examples given (including the examples above) involve the causativization of a base-transitive theme.

==Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik==
Mithun (2000) lists nine causatives for Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik and describes each in detail. Here is a brief description of each:

== Bantu languages ==
===Kinyarwanda===
Kinyarwanda uses periphrastic causatives and morphological causatives.

The periphrastic causatives use the verbs &quot;-teer-&quot; and &quot;-tum-&quot;, which mean &quot;cause&quot;. With &quot;-teer-&quot;, the original S becomes the O of the main clause, leaving the original verb in the infinitive, just like in English:

With &quot;-túm-&quot;, the original S remains in the embedded clause and the original verb is still marked for person and tense:

Derivational causatives use the &quot;-iish-&quot; morpheme, which can be applied to intransitives (3) or transitives (4):



The suffix &quot;-iish-&quot; implies an indirect causation (similar to English &quot;have&quot; in &quot;I had him write a paper&quot;), but other causatives imply a direct causation (similar to English &quot;make&quot; in &quot;I made him write a paper&quot;).

One of the more direct causation devices is the deletion of what is called a &quot;neutral&quot; morpheme &quot;-ik-&quot;, which indicates state or potentiality. Stems with the &quot;-ik-&quot; removed can take &quot;-iish&quot;, but the causation is then less direct:

Another direct causation maker is &quot;-y-&quot; which is used for some verbs:



==Esperanto==
In Esperanto, the suffix &quot;-ig-&quot; can be added to any kind of word:
* &quot;morti&quot; &quot;to die&quot; → &quot;mortigi&quot; &quot;to kill&quot;
* &quot;pura&quot; &quot;clean (adj)&quot; → &quot;purigi&quot; &quot;to clean&quot;

<text>John Buscema ( ; born Giovanni Natale Buscema, ; December 11, 1927 – January 10, 2002) was an American comic book artist and one of the mainstays of Marvel Comics during its 1960s and 1970s ascendancy into an industry leader and its subsequent expansion to a major pop-culture conglomerate. His younger brother Sal Buscema is also a comic book artist.

Buscema is best known for his run on the series &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot;, and for over 200 stories featuring the sword-and-sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. In addition, he pencilled at least one issue of nearly every major Marvel title, including long runs on two of the company&#x27;s top magazines, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; and &quot;Thor&quot;.

He was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2002. In October 2024, Buscema was inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===

Born in Brooklyn, New York City, from Sicilian parents who emigrated from Pozzallo, Ragusa, John Buscema showed an interest in drawing at an early age, copying comic strips such as &quot;Popeye&quot;. In his teens, he developed an interest in both superhero comic books and such adventure comic strips as Hal Foster&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Prince Valiant&quot;, Burne Hogarth&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot;, Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, and Milton Caniff&#x27;s &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. He showed an interest in commercial illustration of the period, by such artists as N. C. Wyeth, Norman Rockwell, Dean Cornwell, Coby Whitmore, Albert Dorne, and Robert Fawcett.

Buscema graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Music and Art. He took night lessons at Pratt Institute as well as life drawing classes at the Brooklyn Museum. While training as a boxer, he began painting portraits of boxers and sold some cartoons to &quot;The Hobo News&quot;. Seeking work as a commercial illustrator while doing various odd jobs, Buscema found himself instead entering the comic book field in 1948, landing a staff job under editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee at Timely Comics, the forerunner of Marvel Comics. The Timely &quot;bullpen&quot;, as the staff was called, included such fellow staffers as established veterans Syd Shores, Carl Burgos, Mike Sekowsky, George Klein, and Marty Nodell. Fellow newcomer Gene Colan, hired roughly two months earlier, recalled that &quot;... John never seemed very happy in comics ... there always seemed to be something else he really wanted to do.&quot;

His first recorded credit is penciling the four-page story &quot;Till Crime Do You Part&quot; in Timely&#x27;s &quot;Lawbreakers Always Lose&quot; #3 (Aug. 1948). He contributed to the &quot;real-life&quot; dramatic series &quot;True Adventures&quot; and &quot;Man Comics&quot; (the premiere issue of which sported one of Buscema&#x27;s earliest recorded comic book covers), as well as to &quot;Cowboy Romances&quot;, &quot;Two-Gun Western&quot; (for which he drew at least one story of the continuing character the Apache Kid), &quot;Lorna the Jungle Queen&quot;, and &quot;Strange Tales&quot;. Until the bullpen was dissolved a year-and-a-half later, as comic books in general and superhero comics in particular continued their post-war fade in popularity, Buscema penciled and inked in a variety of genres, including crime fiction and romance fiction.

===1950s===

Buscema married in 1953. He continued to freelance for Timely, by now known as Atlas Comics, as well as for the publishers Ace Comics, Hillman Periodicals, Our Publications/Orbit-Wanted, Quality Comics, St. John Publications, and Ziff-Davis.

Buscema&#x27;s mid-1950s work includes Dell Comics&#x27; &quot;Roy Rogers Comics&quot; #74–91 (Feb. 1954 – July 1955) and subsequent &quot;Roy Rogers and Trigger&quot; #92–97 and #104–108 (Aug. 1955 – Jan. 1956 &amp; Aug.–Dec. 1956); and the Charlton Comics series &quot;Ramar of the Jungle&quot; and &quot;Nature Boy&quot; — the latter, Buscema&#x27;s first superhero work, with a character created by himself and Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel.

Buscema next produced a series of Western, war, and sword and sandal film adaptations for Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color&quot; series. Buscema recalled, &quot;I did a bunch of their movie books ... that was a lot of fun. I worked from stills on those, except for &quot;The Vikings&quot;. ... I think one of the best books I ever did was &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot;.&quot;

He drew at least one issue of the radio, film, and TV character the Cisco Kid for Dell in 1957, as well as one- to eight-page biographies of every U.S. president through Dwight Eisenhower for that company&#x27;s one-shot &quot;Life Stories of American Presidents&quot;.

During a late 1950s downturn in the comics industry, Buscema drew occasional mystery, fantasy, and science-fiction stories for Atlas Comics&#x27; &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot;, and &quot;Strange Worlds&quot;, and American Comics Group&#x27;s &quot;Adventures into the Unknown&quot;, and &quot;Forbidden Worlds&quot; before leaving comics to do freelance commercial art. He began a freelance position for the New York City advertising firm the Chaite Agency, which employed such commercial artists as Bob Peak and Frank McCarthy.

===1960s===

Buscema spent approximately eight years in the commercial-art field, freelancing for the Chaite Agency and the studio Triad, doing a variety of assignments: layouts, storyboards, illustrations, paperback book covers, etc. in a variety of media. Buscema called this time &quot;quite a learning period for me in my own development of techniques&quot;.

He returned to comic books in 1966 as a regular freelance penciller for Marvel Comics, debuting over Jack Kirby layouts on the &quot;Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; story in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #150 (Nov. 1966), followed by three &quot;Hulk&quot; stories in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #85–87 (Nov. 1966 – Jan. 1967). He then settled in as regular penciller of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, which would become one of his signature series, with #41 (June 1967). &quot;Avengers&quot; #49–50, featuring Hercules and inked by Buscema, are two of his &quot;best-looking [issues] of that period&quot;, said comics historian and one-time Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas, who wrote those issues. Thomas and Buscema introduced new versions of the Black Knight and the Vision during their collaboration on &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

In order to adapt to the Marvel Comics style of superhero adventure, Buscema &quot;synthesized the essence of [Jack] Kirby&#x27;s supercharged action figures, harrowing perspectives, monolithic structures, mega-force explosions, and mythological planetscapes into a formula that he instantly integrated into his own superbly crafted vision,&quot; wrote comics artist and historian Jim Steranko. &quot;The process brought Buscema&#x27;s art to life in a way that it had never been before. Anatomically balanced figures of Herculean proportions stalked, stormed, sprawled, and savaged their way across Marvel&#x27;s universe like none had previously&quot;.

Buscema would pencil an average of two comics a month in collaboration with such inkers as George Klein, Frank Giacoia, Dan Adkins, Joe Sinnott, his younger brother Sal Buscema, Tom Palmer, and, occasionally, Marvel production manager and sometime inker-cartoonist John Verpoorten. John Buscema named Frank Giacoia, Sal Buscema, and Tom Palmer as his favorite inkers.
Among Buscema&#x27;s works during this period fans and historians call the Silver Age of comic books are &quot;The Avengers&quot; #41–62 (June 1967 – March 1969) and &quot;The Avengers Annual&quot; #2 (Sept. 1968); the first eight issues of &quot;The Sub-Mariner&quot; (May–Dec. 1968); &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #72–73, 76–81, 84–85 (ranging from June 1969 – June 1970 providing layouts finished by either John Romita Sr. or Jim Mooney), and two issues he himself finished over Romita layouts. Buscema drew the first appearance of the Prowler in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #78 (Nov. 1969).

In August 1968, Buscema and Stan Lee launched a new title, &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot;. That series about a philosophical alien roaming the world trying to understand both the divinity and the savagery of humanity was a personal favorite of Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee, who scripted. Buscema penciled 17 of its 18 issues — the first seven as a 25¢ &quot;giant-size&quot; title at a time when comics typically cost 12¢. &quot;Beautifully drawn by John Buscema, this comic book represented an attempt to upgrade the medium with a serious character of whom Lee had grown very fond,&quot; assessed comics historian Les Daniels. Roy Thomas said Buscema considered &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #4 (Feb. 1969), featuring a battle between the Silver Surfer and Thor, &quot;as the highpoint of his Marvel work&quot;. Characters Buscema co-created in &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot; include the long-running arch-demon Mephisto in issue #3 (Dec. 1968).

Toward the end of the decade, Buscema drew some fill-in issues of superhero series and returned to familiar 1950s genres with a spate of supernatural mystery stories in &quot;Chamber of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Tower of Shadows&quot;, and romance tales in &quot;My Love&quot; and &quot;Our Love&quot;. He then returned to his signature series &quot;The Avengers&quot; for 11 issues inked by Tom Palmer.

===1970s===
The creative team of Roy Thomas and John Buscema introduced new characters such as Arkon in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #75 (April 1970), Red Wolf in #80 (Sept. 1970), and the Squadron Supreme in #85 (Feb. 1971). With Jack Kirby&#x27;s departure from Marvel in 1970, Buscema succeeded him on both of Kirby&#x27;s titles: &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (penciling issues #107–141, following John Romita Sr.) and &quot;Thor&quot; (#182–259). He additionally launched the feature &quot;Black Widow&quot; in &quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; vol. 2, #1 (Aug. 1970).

Marvel editor-in-chief Stan Lee, who collaborated with Buscema on many stories up to this time, wrote,

Buscema began penciling &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; with #25 (April 1973) following Barry Smith&#x27;s celebrated run, and debuted as the Conan artist of the black-and-white comics-magazine omnibus &quot;Savage Sword of Conan&quot; with issue #1 (Aug. 1974). He would eventually contribute to more than 100 issues of each title, giving him one of the most prolific runs for an artist on a single character. He additionally drew the &quot;Conan&quot; Sunday and daily syndicated newspaper comic strip upon its premiere in 1978, and even contributed some storyboard illustrations for the 1982 Conan movie, as well as painting four covers for the Conan magazines. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Buscema&#x27;s work on &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; seventh on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;.

For about ten years, he would produce an average three to four books&#x27; worth of pencils a month, such as &quot;Nova&quot; (1976) and &quot;Ms. Marvel&quot; (1977). In addition to his regular assignments he would pencil covers and fill-in issues of titles including &quot;Captain America&quot;, &quot;Captain Britain&quot; (Marvel UK), &quot;Daredevil&quot;, &quot;The Frankenstein Monster&quot;, &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, &quot;Master of Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Red Sonja&quot; and &quot;Warlock&quot;. He also drew a story for the science-fiction anthology &quot;Worlds Unknown&quot;.

Buscema contributed as well to Marvel&#x27;s black-and-white comics magazines, including the features &quot;Ka-Zar&quot; in &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #1 (May 1971) and &quot;Bloodstone&quot; in &quot;Rampaging Hulk&quot; #1 (Jan. 1977), and &quot;Doc Savage&quot; #1 and 3 (Aug. 1975, Jan. 1976). Other magazine work ran the gamut from horror (&quot;Dracula Lives!&quot;, &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Zombie&quot;) to humor (&quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Pizzaz&quot;).

Buscema left the &quot;Thor&quot; title for a time to launch the Marvel version of the Edgar Rice Burroughs character Tarzan in 1977. Other licensed projects include a 72-page &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; movie adaptation in an oversized &quot;Treasury Edition&quot; format with DeZuniga inking. For Power Records, which produced children&#x27;s book-and-record sets, Buscema drew &quot;Star Trek&quot; and Conan the Barbarian comics. He contributed some superhero drawings for &quot;Pro&quot;, the NFL official magazine (1970), and penciled some chapters of the first issue of &quot;Marvel Comics Super Special&quot; featuring the rock group Kiss (1977).

In 1978, small-press publisher Sal Quartuccio released &quot;The Art of John Buscema&quot;, a retrospective that included an interview, previously unpublished sketches and drawings, and a cover that was also sold as a poster.

Buscema capped off the decade penciling writer Doug Moench&#x27;s three-issue Weirdworld epic-fantasy tale &quot;Warriors of the Shadow Realm&quot; in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #11–13 (June–Oct. 1979). Pacific Comics released an accompanying portfolio of six signed, colored plates from the story.

====Teaching====
In the mid-1970s, Buscema ran the John Buscema Art School, which advertised for students in the pages of many Marvel titles. Stan Lee made appearances as a guest lecturer at Buscema&#x27;s school, and some of the school&#x27;s graduates (including Bob Hall and Bruce Patterson) went on to become professional cartoonists. Buscema later said that teaching the class was &quot;very gratifying&quot; but that having to make the 60-mile drive after a day&#x27;s work was too exhausting, and ultimately forced him to give it up. Buscema then collaborated with Lee on the book &quot;How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way&quot; (Marvel Fireside Books, 1978), a primer on comic book art and storytelling based on the comic art classes Buscema had given a few years prior, and has remained in print for over 25 years, in its 33rd printing as of 2007.

===1980s===
After drawing the first issue of &quot;The Savage She-Hulk&quot; (Feb. 1980), Buscema abandoned regular superhero work in order to spearhead art duties on all three Conan titles. The popularity of the character spurred the release of a Conan movie in 1982; Buscema provided pencils and inks for a 48-page movie adaptation.

He continued to tackle other high-profile projects such as a Silver Surfer story for &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; #1 (Spring 1980), a King Arthur story in &quot;Marvel Preview&quot; #22 (Summer 1980), the St. Francis of Assisi biography &quot;Francis, Brother of the Universe&quot; (1980), the second &quot;Superman and Spider-Man&quot; team-up (1981), and an adaptation of the 1981 movie &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;.

He left &quot;King Conan&quot; in 1982 after nine issues, although he remained with Marvel&#x27;s Robert E. Howard franchise with a revival of the &quot;Kull&quot; series for 10 issues, and left &quot;The Savage Sword of Conan&quot; in 1984 with #101 with a series of stories that he plotted himself. After pencilling the &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; movie adaptation in 1984 and the &quot;Conan of the Isles&quot; graphic novel in 1987, he left &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; with #190 in 1987, ending a 14-year association with the character.

After nearly five years away from superheroes, except for the first two issues of the X-Men-related, four-issue miniseries &quot;Magik&quot; (Dec. 1983 – March 1984), Buscema returned to familiar ground as regular penciller on &quot;The Avengers&quot; from #255–300 (May 1985 – Feb. 1989). He was regular penciller on &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; for its 300th issue, during a 15-issue stint from #296–309 (Nov. 1986 – Dec. 1987). Additionally, he fit in the three-issue film adaptation &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (Nov. 1986 – Jan. 1987) and the four-issue miniseries &quot;Mephisto&quot; (April–July 1987), starring a character he created with Stan Lee in &quot;The Silver Surfer&quot;.

Buscema reteamed with Lee on the Silver Surfer himself with the 1988 graphic novel &quot;Silver Surfer: Judgment Day&quot;, self-inked and done entirely as full-page panels. That year he and inker Klaus Janson drew a Wolverine solo feature in the biweekly anthology &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;, followed by self-inked Wolverine series in that title. He pencilled the first 14 issues (Nov. 1988 – mid-Nov. 1989) of the first Wolverine ongoing series, self-inked on #7–8. Bill Sienkiewicz, who inked the last five issues of that run, recalled Buscema&#x27;s pencil work as &quot;the sturdiest foundation an inker or an embellisher could possibly hope to build on, and their beauty was not in their attention to fastidiously rendered minutiae, but instead were marvels of deceptive simplicity. Each page an example of grace, elegance and power.&quot;

===Later career===
Buscema began his sixth decade in the field by joining Roy Thomas for a return to &quot;The Savage Sword of Conan&quot; with #191 (Nov. 1991) for a 20-issue run. &quot;Conan the Rogue&quot;, a graphic novel Buscema plotted, pencilled, inked, and colored over a period of five years in his spare time appeared that same year. He both penciled and inked the graphic novel &quot;&quot; (Nov. 1993).

Buscema returned to crime fiction with &quot;The Punisher War Zone&quot; #23–30 (Jan.–Aug. 1994, self-inking #26–29), that title&#x27;s 1993 summer annual, and the 1994 graphic novel &quot;A Man Named Frank&quot;, a parallel-universe Punisher Western tale. He pencilled the Punisher portions of 1994&#x27;s &quot;Archie Meets the Punisher&quot; team-up. No longer attached to a regular series after his &quot;Punisher&quot; run, he penciled and inked &quot;The Avengers Annual&quot; #23 (1994) and five more black-and-white Conan adventures, serving as that Marvel franchise&#x27;s final artist on &quot;The Savage Sword of Conan&quot; with #235 (July 1995) and on the short-lived spin-off &quot;Conan the Savage&quot; with #10 (May 1996). Through 1999, he penciled a variety of superhero comics; both penciled and inked a black-and-white short story for &quot;Shadows and Light&quot; (1998); and made a final return to Conan with the &quot;Death Covered in Gold&quot; three-issue miniseries (1999).

Buscema worked with DC Comics for the first time in 2000, initially doing both pencils and inks on a &quot;Batman Black and White&quot; short story in &quot;&quot; #7 (Sept. 2000). He reunited with Stan Lee on the 2001 one-shot &quot;Just Imagine Stan Lee and John Buscema Creating Superman&quot;.

He finished the pencils on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Superman: Blood of my Ancestors&quot;, begun by Gil Kane, who had since died, and had just signed on for a five-issue miniseries with Roy Thomas, &quot;JLA: Barbarians&quot;, though he died after finishing the first issue.

An 11 x 17-inch lithograph print of the late 1960s/early 1970s Avengers, penciled by Buscema and painted in watercolor by Alex Ross for the publisher Dynamic Forces, was Buscema&#x27;s last professional work.

Buscema&#x27;s passion for drawing was such that he continued to draw and sketch in his spare time, often on the back of comic book art pages, and these images form a considerable body of work in their own right. His brother Sal Buscema recalled,
==Personal life==
Buscema, who lived in Port Jefferson, New York, on Long Island, at the time of his death, was married to Dolores Buscema, with whom he had a son, John Jr., and a daughter, Dianne. His granddaughter Stephanie Buscema is a freelance illustrator and cartoonist, who started out as an inker for her grandfather.

==Death and legacy==
Buscema was diagnosed with stomach cancer, and died on January 10, 2002, at the age of 74. He was buried with an artist&#x27;s pen in his hand.

On October 11, 2024, the Harvey Awards announced that Buscema was one of five comics creators to be inducted into the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame at the 36th annual Harvey Awards ceremony on October 18 at the New York Comic Con. The other four inductees were Akira Toriyama, Larry Hama, Sergio Aragonés, and Arthur Adams. Upon learning of the accolade, Buscema’s daughter, Dianne Buscema Gerogianis, stated, &quot;We are honored on behalf of my father and wish to thank all who have selected him for the Harvey Awards Hall of Fame. Thank you for keeping his legacy alive.&quot;

<text>A billiard ball is a small, hard ball used in cue sports, such as carom billiards, pool, and snooker. The number, type, diameter, color, and pattern of the balls differ depending upon the specific game being played. Various particular ball properties such as hardness, friction coefficient, and resilience are important to accuracy.

==History==

Early balls were made of various materials, including wood and clay (the latter remaining in use well into the 20th century). Although affordable ox-bone balls were in common use in Europe, elephant ivory was favored since at least 1627 until the early 20th century; the earliest known written reference to ivory billiard balls is in the 1588 inventory of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. Dyed and numbered balls appeared around the early 1770s. By the mid-19th century, elephants were being slaughtered for their ivory at an alarming rate, just to keep up with the demand for high-end billiard balls – no more than eight balls could be made from a single elephant&#x27;s tusks. The billiard industry realized that the supply of elephants (their primary source of ivory) was endangered, as well as dangerous to obtain (the latter an issue of notable public concern at the turn of the 19th century). Inventors were challenged to come up with an alternative material that could be manufactured, with a US$10,000 (worth approximately $ in 2025) prize being offered by a New York supplier.

Although not the first artificial substance to be used for the balls (e.g. Sorel cement, invented in 1867, was marketed as an artificial ivory), John Wesley Hyatt patented an &quot;ivory imitation&quot; composite made of nitrocellulose, camphor, and ground cattle bone on May 4, 1869 (US patent 89582, the first US billiard ball patent). The material was a success, and was sold as Bonzoline, Crystalate, Ivorylene until the 1960s, and was used by prominent professional players such as John Roberts Jr (1847–1919), Charles Dawson (1866–1921), and Walter Lindrum (1898–1960). The ivory substitute was one of the most significant early reinforced plastics; induced the global growth of billiards, pool, and snooker; and helped create a modern idea that the artificial can surpass the natural. It is unclear if the cash prize was ever awarded, and there is no evidence suggesting he did in fact win it.

However, Hyatt&#x27;s composite had problems. One of the most relevant is cellulose nitrate flammability, not because of making the billiard balls explode, as is often claimed, but because of the dangers of handling it in its pure form during manufacturing. Another problem was related to camphor mass exploitation, leading to the devastation of Taiwan&#x27;s forests and displacement of indigenous communities. Subsequently, the industry experimented with various other synthetic materials for billiard balls such as Bakelite, acrylic, and other plastic compounds.

The exacting requirements of the billiard ball are met today with balls cast from plastic materials that are strongly resistant to cracking and chipping. Currently Saluc, under the brand name Aramith and other private labels, manufactures phenolic resin balls. Other plastics and resins such as polyester (similar to those used for bowling balls) and clear acrylic are also used.

Ivory balls remained in use in artistic billiards competition until the late 20th century.

==Types==

===Carom billiards===

In the realm of carom billiards games, three balls are used to play most games on pocketless billiards tables. Carom balls are not numbered, and are 61–61.5 mm (approximately in) in diameter, and a weight ranging between with a typical weight of . They are typically colored as follows:
* White: for the first player
* Yellow: cue ball for the second player (historically this was white with a distinguishing spot)
* Red: the (four-ball uses an extra object ball, usually blue).
===Pool===
Pool balls are used to play various pool games, such as eight-ball, nine-ball, and straight pool. These balls, the most widely used throughout the world, are smaller than carom billiards balls, and larger than those for snooker. According to World Pool-Billiard Association equipment specifications, the weight may be from with a diameter of , plus or minus . 
The balls are numbered and colored as in the table show here. Balls 1 through 7 are the of and 9 through 15 are the . The 8 ball is not considered part of either suit. Striped balls were introduced around 1889. 

Rotation games do not distinguish between solids and stripes, but rather use the numbering on the balls to determine which must be pocketed. In other games such as straight pool neither type of marking is of any consequence. 

Some balls used in televised pool games are colored differently in order to make them more distinguishable on television monitors. Most commonly, the dark purple used on the 4 and 12 balls is replaced by pink to make it easier to distinguish the 4 from the black 8 ball, and similarly the 7 and 15 balls use a lighter brown color instead of a deep maroon. Other, less common color substitutions are also found, dependent on manufacturer. These sets often have a cue ball with multiple spots on its surface so that placed on it is evident to viewers.

Coin-operated pool tables, such as those found at bowling alleys, arcades, or bars/pubs, may use a slightly different-sized cue ball, so that the cue ball can be separated from object balls by the table&#x27;s ball return mechanism and delivered into its own ball return. Such different sized cue balls are considered less than ideal because they change the dynamics of the equipment. Other tables use a system where a magnet pulls a cue ball with a thin layer of metal embedded inside away from the object ball collection chamber and into the cue ball return, allowing the cue ball to more closely match the object balls in size and weight. More recently, optical systems that recognize the cue ball, which is more translucent than the other balls due to its solid white color, and separate it mechanically have been developed.
===Blackball and British-style eight-ball pool===

In British-style eight-ball pool and its blackball variant, fifteen object balls are used, but fall into two unnumbered s, the (or less commonly ) and , with a white cue ball, and black 8 ball.

Aside from the 8, shots are not since there is no reliable way to identify particular balls to be pocketed. Because they are unnumbered, they are wholly unsuited to certain pool games, such as nine-ball, in which ball order is important. They are typically smaller than the American-style balls; the most common object ball diameters are and . The yellow-and-red sets are sometimes referred to as &quot;casino sets&quot; as they were developed to make identification of suits easier for spectators at eight-ball championships often held in casinos. Such sets were sold by the Brunswick–Balke–Collender Co. as early as 1908. Similar to standard pool balls, there are also special sets designed for televised games; these sets have a black-striped 8 ball, and a spotted cue ball.
===Snooker===

Ball sets for snooker consist of twenty-two balls in total, arranged as a rack of 15 unmarked red balls, six s placed at various predetermined spots on the table, and a white cue ball. The colour balls are sometimes numbered with their point values in the style of pool balls for the home market.
Snooker balls are standardized at in diameter within a tolerance of plus or minus . No standard weight is defined, but all balls in the set must be the same weight within a tolerance of . Snooker sets are also available with considerably smaller-than-regulation balls (and even with ten instead of fifteen reds) for play on smaller tables (down to half-size), and are sanctioned for use in some amateur leagues. Sets for American snooker are typically , with numbered colour balls.

The set of eight colours used for snooker balls (including white) are thought to be derived from croquet, which uses the same set of colors. Snooker was invented in 1884 by British Army officers stationed in India. Croquet reached its peak popularity at the same time, particularly among people in the same social context. There are many other similarities between croquet and snooker, which when taken together, suggest that the derivation of the latter owes much to the existence of the former.
===Other games===

Various other games have their own variants of billiard balls. English billiards uses the same number of balls as carom billiards, but the same size as snooker balls, as the game is played on the same size table as snooker. Each player uses a separate cue ball, with modern English billiards sets using one white ball with red spots and the other being yellow with red spots.

Russian pyramid uses a set of fifteen numbered white balls and a red or yellow cue ball that are even larger than carom billiards balls at . Kaisa has the same pocket and ball dimensions but uses only five balls: one yellow, two red and two white cue balls, one for each player.

Bumper pool requires four white and four red object balls, and two special balls, one red with a white spot and the other white with red spot; all are usually in diameter. Bar billiards uses six or seven white balls (depending on regional variations) and one red ball in diameter.

===Novelty balls===

There is a market for specialty cue balls and even entire ball sets, featuring sports team logos, cartoon characters, animal pelt patterns, or other non-standard decorations.

Entrepreneurial inventors also supply a variety of novelty billiard games with unique rules and balls, some with playing card markings, others with stars and stripes, and yet others in sets of more than thirty balls in several suits. Marbled-looking and glittery materials are also popular for home tables. There are even blacklight sets for playing in near-dark. There are also practical joke cue and 8 balls, with off-center weights in them that make their paths curve and wobble. Miniature sets in various sizes (typically or of normal size) are also commonly available, primarily intended for undersized toy tables. Even an egg-shaped ball has been patented and marketed under such names as Bobble Ball and Tag Ball.

==In popular culture==
The 8 ball is frequently used in Western, especially American, culture as an element of T-shirt designs, album covers and names, tattoos, household goods like paperweights and cigarette lighters, belt buckles, etc. A classic toy is the Magic 8 Ball &quot;oracle&quot;.

The term &quot;8-ball&quot; is also slang both for of cocaine or crystal meth, and for a bottle of Olde English 800 malt liquor. It has also been used to refer to African-Americans, particularly those of darker skin tones, as in the films &quot;Show Boat&quot; and &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;. The expression &quot;behind the eight [ball]&quot; is used to indicate a dilemma from which it is difficult to extricate oneself. The term derives from the game kelly pool.

Because the collisions between billiard balls are nearly elastic, and the balls roll on a surface that produces low rolling friction, their behavior is often used to illustrate Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. Idealized, frictionless billiard balls are a staple of mathematical theorems and physics models, and figure in dynamical billiards, scattering theory, Lissajous knots, billiard ball computing, and reversible cellular automata, Polchinski&#x27;s paradox, contact dynamics, collision detection, the illumination problem, atomic ultracooling, quantum mirages, and elsewhere in these fields.

&quot;Billiard balls&quot; or &quot;pool balls&quot; is the name given to balls used in stage magic tricks, especially the classic &quot;multiplying billiard balls&quot;. Though derived from real billiard balls, today they are usually smaller, for easier manipulation and hiding, but not so small and light that they are difficult to juggle, as the magic and juggling disciplines have often overlapped since their successful combination by pioneers like Paul Vandy.

The phrase &quot;as smooth as a billiard ball&quot; is sometimes applied to describe a bald person, and the term &quot;cue ball&quot; is also slang for someone who sports a shaved head.

<doc id="618986" wikidata="Q1766899" url="?curid=618986" title="Childhood (Tolstoy novel)">
<text>Childhood (pre-reform Russian: ; post-reform ) is the first published novel by Leo Tolstoy, released under the initials L. N. in the November 1852 issue of the popular Russian literary journal &quot;The Contemporary&quot;.

It is the first in a series of three novels, followed by &quot;Boyhood&quot; and &quot;Youth&quot;. Published when Tolstoy was just twenty-three years old, the book was an immediate success. It earned Tolstoy notice from other Russian novelists including Ivan Turgenev, who heralded the young Tolstoy as a major up-and-coming figure in Russian literature.

&quot;Childhood&quot; explores the inner life of a young boy, Nikolenka. It is one of the books in Russian writing to explore an expressionistic style, mixing fact, fiction, and emotions to render the moods and reactions of the narrator.

==Excerpt==
&quot;Will the freshness, lightheartedness, the need for love, and strength of faith which you have in childhood ever return? What better time than when the two best virtues -- innocent joy and the boundless desire for love -- were the only motives in life?&quot;
