<text>Shane Gilberto Jenek (born 18 February 1982), better known under the stage name Courtney Act, is an Australian drag queen, singer and television personality. Courtney first came to prominence competing on the first season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; in 2003. After the show, she signed to BMG Australia (now Sony Music Australia), and she released her debut single, &quot;Rub Me Wrong&quot;, which peaked at No. 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified Gold. While auditioning for &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, she became the first LGBTQ contestant to openly appear on a reality TV talent show. In 2014, Courtney was one of the runners-up in season six of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. Courtney is a member of the drag girl-group, The AAA Girls. 

In 2014, Courtney released the extended play &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (2015); the title-track was the official song for the 2016 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. In January 2018, Courtney appeared on season 21 of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother UK&quot; and ultimately won the series. She began branching into a hosting career, hosting &quot;The Bi Life&quot; on E! and her own television special, &quot;The Courtney Act Show&quot;. Courtney released &quot;Fight for Love&quot; in late 2018 for the &quot;Eurovision – Australia Decides&quot; final; she finished in fourth place.
In 2019, Courtney competed and was runner-up on season 16 of the Australian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, where she was paired with Joshua Keefe. In 2022, Act was a judge on the ITV reality competition series, &quot;Queens for the Night&quot;.

Jenek uses the pronoun &quot;she&quot; when referring to Courtney and &quot;he&quot; when referring to himself.

==Early life and education ==
Shane Gilberto Jenek was born on 18 February 1982 in Brisbane, Australia, and moved to Sydney at age 18. He was born to Gill and Annette Jenek and has an older sister named Kim. His mother is of Danish descent and his father is of German descent; they worked in Kings Cross and befriended cabaret performer and TV personality Carlotta. 

Growing up, Jenek would always dress up and sing and dance, but couldn&#x27;t identify with anything that was portrayed in the media. In 1987, he entered a competition, Tiny Tots, which was a charity pageant show for children, and won. At a young age, he began attending The Fame Talent School, where he became close friends with twins Lisa and Jessica Origliasso, who would later become The Veronicas. The group performed together for twelve years, performing acts such as pantomime in local shopping centres such as the Strathpine Centre, the Toombul Shopping Centre, and Westfield Chermside. 

Jenek found school difficult due to bullying over his sexuality. He began to think something was wrong with him during his teenage years. He attended Nashville Primary School in Brighton, but his parents wanted him to go to a private school for his secondary studies, so he transferred to St Paul&#x27;s Anglican School in Bald Hills a year early to &quot;acclimatise&quot;. Jenek disliked the school, and moved to Sandgate District State High School after two years at St. Paul&#x27;s. After school, he would frequently go clubbing with friends in Brisbane, particularly on Mary Street. Jenek received high grades at school and he was going to study medicine to become a doctor. 

He first attended the Stonewall Club in the mid-90s and Jenek states that was the start of his &quot;big queer life&quot;. While touring colleges, he visited the National Institute of Dramatic Art, and, instead of moving forward to Perth to tour the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, he spent a week in Sydney behind his parents’ backs &quot;living a lifetime of gay&quot;.

==Career==
===2002: Beginnings and &quot;Australian Idol&quot;===
Jenek&#x27;s drag queen career began in 2002 when he met Sydney drag queen Vanity Faire. He was intrigued by the visual feminine illusion Faire would create once she was in drag and this inspired him to begin his drag career. While deciding his drag name, he originally intended to take the name &quot;Ginger Le&#x27;Bon&quot; and be a &quot;redheaded, smoky voiced nightclub singer&quot;, but, instead, he decided upon the stage name Courtney Act as, in a non-rhotic accent like the Australian accent, the phrase &quot;caught in the act&quot; is heard. Courtney has stated that in 2002, when she began performing in drag, one had to &quot;fight&quot; and &quot;earn&quot; one&#x27;s place as a drag queen. She entered the Diva Rising Star competition in 2002 and won.

In 2003, while working as a waiter at Jimmy&#x27;s on the Mall, a restaurant in Brisbane, Courtney auditioned for the inaugural season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot;. He first appeared as Jenek, but the judges, Ian Dickson, Marcia Hines and Mark Holden, told Jenek that his voice was &quot;just not up to it&quot;. The following day, Jenek returned to audition but as Courtney Act. Hines said that Courtney was &quot;great&quot;. Dickson said, &quot;Shane only didn&#x27;t just cut it. You&#x27;ve added another dimension and this time you&#x27;ve blown us away.&quot; Courtney continued through the competition and reached the live finals. In the first TV vote Courtney did not advance; however, the judges brought her back as a wildcard. During her time on the show she performed songs such as: &quot;I Am Woman&quot; by Helen Reddy, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; by Lesley Gore and “You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; by AC/DC. Courtney finished in thirteenth place on the show, but remained highly popular throughout Australia. At the time, Jenek was the first and only LGBT contestant to openly appear on a reality TV talent show.

Together with business partner and fellow drag queen Vanity Faire, Courtney operates Wigs by Vanity; they started the company in 2003, the year Courtney auditioned for idol, with the aim of producing wigs for drag queens.

===2003: Record deal and &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;===

After the completion of the first season of Australian Idol, Courtney went on tour with the finalists of the show. In 2003, Courtney signed a major record deal with BMG Australia now known as Sony Music Australia. Courtney released her debut single &quot;Rub Me Wrong&quot; the following year in March 2004, where the song reached a peak of number 29 on the ARIA Charts and gaining a gold certification by the charts. Courtney returned to the club scene and began working with the up-and-coming Lady Gaga. 

In August 2011, Jenek moved to West Hollywood, California. 

In December 2013, Logo TV announced that Courtney was among the 14 drag queens who would be competing on the sixth season of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. Courtney is the only queen from Australia ever to be featured on the show. Episode 4 featured Courtney as the main challenge winner. The main challenge was to perform in &quot;Shade: The Rusical&quot;. Courtney was praised for her &quot;strong&quot; singing voice and acting skills. Courtney proceeded to the final in the top 3. Courtney was the fourth contestant during the show&#x27;s six seasons not to have fallen into the bottom two throughout the competition. She placed as joint runner-up alongside Adore Delano, behind winner Bianca Del Rio. 

===2014-2020===

In July 2014, Courtney became the first drag performer in history to sing live with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. She appeared as a guest performer with Cheyenne Jackson in &quot;Hello, Gorgeous! Cheyenne Jackson Goes to the Movies&quot;. The two sang a duet of &quot;Elephant Love Song&quot; from the 2001 Baz Luhrmann film &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; In September 2014, Courtney, along with Willam Belli and Alaska Thunderfuck 5000, were the first drag queens to become ad girls for American Apparel, known as The AAA Girls. She worked for the campaign Support Artists, Support Ethical Manufacturing from the fashion brand. The group released their debut single &quot;American Apparel Ad Girls&quot;. The song charted at number 10 on the Billboard Comedy Digital songs chart: the song would later feature in Belli&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Shartistry in Motion&quot; (2014). In December 2014 the group released a Christmas song, &quot;Dear Santa, Bring Me a Man&quot;, which was featured in the first &quot;Christmas Queens&quot; (2015). The album also saw Courtney cover a solo version of &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot;. Again in June 2015, the group reunited to record for Alaska&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Anus&quot; (2015), where they collaborated on the track &quot;The Shade of It All&quot;.

In July 2015, Courtney returned to her solo recording career and created the extended play &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (2015). The album generally received positives from critics and it saw the release of lead single &quot;Ecstasy&quot;. This was followed by &quot;Ugly&quot;, &quot;Body Parts&quot; and the title track song &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;. The latter featured as the official song for the 2016 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Courtney stated: &quot;I feel that gender and sexuality are fluid and so often we get stuck in the rigidity. Who knows when someone outside your usual target zone might come also and sweep you off your feet?”. In 2016, Courtney was the foreign correspondent for the Australian news website, &quot;Junkee&quot;. Courtney covered the US Presidential election 2016 for the site, attending rallies of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Following Trump&#x27;s election, Courtney also participated in, and reported on, the 2017 Women&#x27;s March.
In late 2017, Courtney appeared in &quot;Single AF&quot;, broadcast on MTV UK. In February 2018, Courtney was appointed one of two Fringe Ambassadors at the Adelaide Fringe, presenting the show &quot;Under the Covers&quot; there. In 2017, Courtney reunited with The AAA Girls for the &quot;Access All Areas Tour&quot; (2017). Produced by Fullscreen Live, the tour played in 15 cities in the United States and Canada. The Squared Division served as creative directors and Jae Fusz served as choreographer.

In 2018, Courtney entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house, and remained in the house for 32 days, eventually winning the season, beating Ann Widdecombe. Jenek appeared as both Courtney and himself throughout the season, being referred to &quot;him&quot; out of drag and &quot;her&quot; in drag. Channel 4 confirmed &quot;The Courtney Act Show&quot;, with Courtney saying that she would be &quot;working with some of [her] favourite artists&quot;, which was broadcast on Christmas Eve of 2018. The show featured performances from Bianca Del Rio, Adore Delano, Darienne Lake and Leona Lewis. Jenek also hosted the dating reality show &quot;The Bi Life&quot;, appearing both as Courtney Act and Shane, which premiered in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 25 October 2018 on E! Courtney competed with the song &quot;Fight for Love&quot; on &quot;Eurovision – Australia Decides&quot; in February 2019 to represent Australia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, but was not successful, losing out to Kate Miller-Heidke with the song &quot;Zero Gravity&quot;. The show received positive reviews. In June 2019, a panel of judges from &quot;New York&quot; magazine placed her third on their list of &quot;the most powerful drag queens in America&quot;, a ranking of 100 former &quot;Drag Race&quot; contestants.

In 2019, Courtney competed in the 16th season of the Australian version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with Joshua Keefe, where they came second.

<doc id="613344" wikidata="Q2400076" url="?curid=613344" title="Teenage Head (band)">
<text>Teenage Head is a Canadian punk rock group from Hamilton, Ontario, that has been popular in Canada since the early 1980s.

The group was formed in Hamilton, Ontario in 1974 by Frankie Venom (Frank Kerr), Gord Lewis, Steve Mahon, and Nick Stipanitz. 

Venom died on October 15, 2008. Lewis died August 7, 2022.

The band&#x27;s name is a reference to The Flaming Groovies&#x27; 1971 album &quot;Teenage Head&quot;, which Gord Lewis had seen advertised in a music magazine but not heard, and decided that he, one day, would form a band with that name.

== History ==
Teenage Head was formed in 1975 when the band members were students at Westdale High School in Hamilton. The original lineup featured Gord Lewis on guitar, Steve Park on guitar, Frankie Venom on drums and Dave Desroches on vocals. Frankie Venom quickly became the new vocalist, and Lewis recruited old friends Steve Mahon to play bass and Nick Stipanitz to play drums. 

DesRoches moved on to form his own group, The Shakers. He rejoined Teenage Head as vocalist in the mid-1980s (for the album Electric Guitars), and yet again in 2016. Steve Park soon left and later joined another Hamilton band, Simply Saucer.

Their first gig was on October 17, 1975, in the Westdale Secondary School cafeteria. The band&#x27;s first professional gigs happened in February 1976 with a few shows at the Town Casino at Main and Walnut streets in Hamilton.

By May 1978, they released their first single &quot;Picture My Face&quot; on Epic Records, and their self-titled debut, &quot;Teenage Head&quot;, followed a year later, which went gold. The band&#x27;s performance at The Last Pogo concert on December 1, 1978, at The Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto, ended in a riot and was shut down by the police. The concert was made into a short film by Colin Brunton, &quot;The Last Pogo&quot;. In 2006, Brunton began a feature-length documentary film about the concert, including additional interviews and footage of Teenage Head. It was released on DVD in 2008 as a tribute to the late Frankie Venom.

Gold-selling &quot;Frantic City&quot; was released in 1980. It was the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, making them stars across Canada with the hit singles &quot;Let&#x27;s Shake&quot; and &quot;Somethin&#x27; On My Mind&quot;. They toured to support that album, including opening the major Heatwave festival in August. In June 1980 their performance at Toronto&#x27;s Ontario Place sparked a riot. The incident made headlines across the country, and led Ontario Place to ban rock concerts for several years.

In September 1980, riding high on the success of &quot;Frantic City&quot; and the band&#x27;s unintended notoriety, Attic Records, their Canadian label, set up a series of showcase gigs in New York City, hoping to attract a U.S. record deal. Only a few days before their scheduled departure, Lewis was seriously injured in a car accident and the showcase was cancelled. Lewis was temporarily replaced by David Bendeth, although he was able to return in time to play on the 1982 album &quot;Some Kinda Fun&quot;, which was another success reaching gold status.

Their 1983 record &quot;Tornado&quot; was marked by controversy, with the band&#x27;s new American label MCA Records demanding that they change their name to &#x27;Teenage Heads&#x27; to placate the more conservative American audience. The title track was the band&#x27;s last big hit in Canada. During this time the band appeared, as themselves, in the film &quot;Class of 1984&quot; (starring fellow Canadian Michael J. Fox) and performed &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No Sense&quot;.

In 1986, one year after the release of &quot;Trouble in the Jungle&quot;, Venom left the band to form a new group, Frankie Venom and The Vipers. Nick Stipanitz joined the Vipers as well. Venom was replaced by Dave Desroches, who led the band for three years before departing to form his own band, The Dave Rave Conspiracy. Stipanitz later left the Vipers and did a stint with The Tennessee Rockets. Venom and Stipanitz came back to Teenage Head when the group reformed in 1988, but Stipanitz left Teenage Head shortly after this reformation, and went into a professional career in drafting and engineering. He was first replaced by Blair Richard Martin of the Raving Mojos, then Mark Lockerbie, who played on the 1996 album, &quot;Head Disorder&quot;. Lockerbie was in turn replaced by Jack Pedler.

In 2003, the band recorded a host of previously released material with Ramones drummer Marky Ramone at Catherine North Studios in Hamilton and Metalworks Studios in Toronto with Ramones producer, Daniel Rey. The resulting album was released in Canada on April 22, 2008, titled &quot;Teenage Head with Marky Ramone&quot;. In early 2007, Teenage Head played in Alberta and British Columbia for the first time in more than ten years. They returned again in the spring of 2008.

On October 15, 2008, Gord Lewis announced that Frankie Venom had died at 52, following a battle with throat cancer. In his hometown of Hamilton, Ontario a memorial statue of Frankie Venom had been planned but has been stalled because of criticism of public funds being spent to commemorate a man who used illegal drugs and was once convicted for domestic assault.

The remaining members of the band continued to perform after Venom&#x27;s death playing a tribute show for him, and performing at the 2008 Hamilton Music Awards. In 2009, longtime fan and friend of the band, Pete MacAulay joined as the new singer, to in his words &quot;take Frankie&#x27;s space, not his place&quot;.

In 2014, Canadian writer Geoff Pevere published the book &quot;Gods of the Hammer: The Teenage Head Story&quot;. To help celebrate the book launch, the band played a guest vocalist night at the 2014 edition of Canadian Music Week. Musicians performing with Teenage Head that evening including the Dead Boys&#x27; Cheetah Chrome, Men Without Hats&#x27; Ivan Doroschuk, the Doughboys (Canadian band)&#x27; John Kastner and Change of Heart (band)&#x27;s Ian Blurton. 

In November 2016, Teenage Head announced the return of Desroches as lead singer. Jack Pedler, due to illness was replaced by Gene Champagne, also of the Un-Teens and The Killjoys. In late 2017, Teenage Head began performing record release parties throughout Ontario for their new remix and remastered compilation, &quot;Fun Comes Fast&quot;.

On August 7, 2022, original member Gord Lewis was found murdered in his home at age 65. His son Jonathan Lewis was arrested shortly after the crime and charged with second-degree murder. Teenage Head said the band will continue with performances following Lewis&#x27; murder, as was his wish.

<text>Philipp Mainländer (5 October 1841 – 1 April 1876) was a German philosopher and poet. Born Philipp Batz, he later changed his name to &quot;Mainländer&quot; in homage to his hometown, Offenbach am Main.

In his central work, (&quot;The Philosophy of Redemption&quot; or &quot;The Philosophy of Salvation&quot;) — according to Theodor Lessing, &quot;perhaps the most radical system of pessimism known to philosophical literature&quot; — Mainländer proclaims that life is of negative value, and that &quot;the will, ignited by the knowledge that non-being is better than being, is the supreme principle of morality.&quot;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career ===
Born in Offenbach am Main, on October 5, 1841 &quot;as a child of marital rape&quot;, Philipp Mainländer grew up the youngest of six siblings. One of his brothers was mentally ill, according to Cesare Lombroso in &quot;The Man of Genius&quot;, as had been one of his grandfathers who had died of suicide at the age of 33.

Mainländer attended the Realschule in Offenbach from 1848 to 1856. In 1856, at his father&#x27;s instruction, he entered the commercial school of Dresden to become a merchant. The following year, his older brother, Daniel Batz, committed suicide, cementing the family history of succumbing to mental illness. In 1858, Philipp was employed in a trading house in Naples, Italy, where he learned Italian and acquainted himself with the works of Dante, Petrarca, Boccaccio, and – most notably – Leopardi. Mainländer would later describe his five Neapolitan years as the happiest years of his life.

During this critical period of his life, Mainländer discovered Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s central work &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;. Nineteen years old at the time, he would later describe the event as a penetrating revelation, referring to February 1860 as the &quot;most important of [his] life&quot;. Indeed, Schopenhauer would remain the most important influence on Mainländer&#x27;s later philosophical work.

In 1863, Mainländer returned to Germany to work in his father&#x27;s business. In the same year, he also penned the three-part poem (&quot;The Last Hohenstaufens&quot;). Two years later, on 5 October, Mainländer&#x27;s 24th birthday, his mother died. Deeply affected by this experience of loss, Mainländer began an ongoing turn away from poetry and towards philosophy. During the following years, he studied Schopenhauer, Kant – (&quot;not poisoned through Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, but rather critically strengthened through Schopenhauer&quot;), Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;, and the classics of philosophy from Heraclitus to Condillac.

In March 1869, Mainländer worked in the banking house J. Mart. Magnus in Berlin with the declared goal of amassing a small fortune within a few years and then leading a decent life from the interest earnings. However, the stock market crash at the on 8 May 1873 (), totally ruined Mainländer and caused a sudden end to these plans. In 1873, Mainländer resigned from his post at the bank without really knowing what he would do afterwards.

=== Development of &quot;Die Philosophie der Erlösung&quot; ===
Although his wealthy parents had bought off his military service in 1861, Mainländer – according to an autobiographic note – expressed the desire &quot;to be absolutely in all things submitted to another one once, to do the lowermost work, to have to obey blindly&quot; and sedulously undertook numerous attempts to serve with weapons. On 6 April 1874, Mainländer, already 32 years old, submitted a request directly to the emperor Wilhelm I of Germany which was granted; this resulted in his appointment to the Cuirassiers in Halberstadt, beginning 28 September. During the four months leading up to his conscription, Mainländer, obsessed with work, composed the first volume of his main work &quot;Die Philosophie der Erlösung&quot;. Describing this time, he later wrote:And now an enchanting life began, a spiritual blossoming full of bliss and blissful shivers. [...] This life lasted four full months; it filled June, July, August and September. Completely clear, consistent, and well-rounded was my system in my mind, and a creative frenzy revived me that did not need the whip of the thought that I must be finished by 28 September; for on 1 October I &quot;had&quot; to put on the king&#x27;s coat - this date could not be postponed. If I hadn&#x27;t finished by then, it would take &quot;three&quot; years for me to put the finishing touches on my work, i.e. I would have seen myself thrown into an abyss into which the furies of a broken existence would inevitably have thrown me.Mainländer handed the completed manuscript to his sister Minna, asking her to find a publisher while he completed his military service. The author composed a letter to the as yet unknown publisher, requesting the omission of his birth name and substitution of the pen name &quot;Philipp Mainländer&quot;, and stating that he would abhor nothing more than &quot;being exposed to the eyes of the world&quot;.

On 1 November 1875, Mainländer – originally committed for three years, but in the meantime, as he noted in a letter to Minna, &quot;exhausted, &quot;worked-out&quot;, ... at completely ... healthy body ineffably tired&quot; – was prematurely released from military service, and traveled back to his hometown of Offenbach, where he – again having become obsessed with work – within a mere two months, corrected the unbound sheets of &quot;Die Philosophie der Erlösung&quot;, composed his memoirs, wrote the novella &quot;Rupertine del Fino&quot;, and completed the 650-page second volume of his &quot;magnum opus&quot;.

=== Death ===
Around the beginning of 1876, Mainländer began to doubt whether his life still had value for humanity. He wondered whether he had already completed the duties of life, or whether he should employ it to strengthen the social democratic movement. Despite writing down addresses to the German workers, these plans did not materialize. During the night of April 1st, in his Offenbach apartment, and very shortly after the publication of the first volume of his main work, Mainländer hanged himself. He was buried in Offenbach cemetery.

His older sister, Minna Batz, having been charged with writing a memoir of her brother, followed him through suicide in 1891.

==Philosophy==

Working in the metaphysical framework of Schopenhauer, Mainländer sees the &quot;will&quot; as the innermost core of being, the ontological arche. However, he deviates from Schopenhauer in important respects. With Schopenhauer the will is singular, unified and beyond time and space. Schopenhauer&#x27;s transcendental idealism leads him to conclude that we only have access to a certain aspect of the thing-in-itself by introspective observation of our own bodies. What we observe as will is all there is to observe, nothing more. There are no hidden aspects. Furthermore, via introspection we can only observe our &quot;individual&quot; will. This also leads Mainländer to the philosophical position of pluralism. The goals he set for himself and for his system are reminiscent of ancient Greek philosophy: what is the relation between the undivided existence of the &quot;One&quot; and the everchanging world of becoming that we experience.

Additionally, Mainländer accentuates on the idea of salvation for all of creation. This is yet another respect in which he differentiates his philosophy from that of Schopenhauer. With Schopenhauer, the silencing of the will is a rare event. The artistic genius can achieve this state temporarily, while only a few saints have achieved total cessation throughout history. For Mainländer, the entirety of the cosmos is slowly but surely moving towards the silencing of the will to live and to (as he calls it) &quot;redemption&quot;.

Mainländer theorized that an initial singularity dispersed and expanded into the known universe. This dispersion from a singular unity to a multitude of things offered a smooth transition between monism and pluralism. Mainländer thought that with the regression of time, all kinds of pluralism and multiplicity would revert to monism and he believed that, with his philosophy, he had managed to explain this transition from oneness to multiplicity and becoming.

=== Death of God ===
Despite his scientific means of explanation, Mainländer was not afraid to philosophize in allegorical terms. Formulating his own &quot;myth of creation&quot;, Mainländer equated this initial singularity with God.

Mainländer reinterprets Schopenhauer&#x27;s metaphysics in two important aspects. Primarily, in Mainländer&#x27;s system there is no &quot;singular will&quot;. The basic unity has broken apart into individual wills and each subject in existence possesses an individual will of his own. Because of this, Mainländer can claim that once an &quot;individual will&quot; is silenced and dies, it achieves absolute nothingness and not the relative nothingness we find in Schopenhauer. By recognizing death as salvation and by giving nothingness an absolute quality, Mainländer&#x27;s system manages to offer &quot;wider&quot; means for redemption. Secondarily, Mainländer reinterprets the Schopenhauerian will-to-live as an underlying will-to-die, i.e. the will-to-live is the means towards the will-to-die.

=== Ethics ===
Mainländer&#x27;s philosophy also carefully inverts other doctrines. For instance, Epicurus sees happiness only in pleasure and since there is nothing after death, there is nothing to fear and/or desire from death. Yet Mainländer, being a philosophical pessimist, sees no desirable pleasure in this life and praises the sublime nothingness of death, recognizing precisely this state of non-existence as desirable.

Mainländer espouses an ethics of egoism. That is to say that what is best for an individual is what makes one happiest. Yet all pursuits and cravings lead to pain. Thus, Mainländer concludes that a will-to-death is best for the happiness of all and knowledge of this transforms one&#x27;s will-to-life (an illusory existence unable to attain happiness) into the proper (sought by God) will-to-death. Ultimately, the subject (individual will) is one with the universe, in harmony with it and with its originating will, if one wills nothingness. Based on these premises, Mainländer makes the distinction between the &quot;ignorant&quot; and the &quot;enlightened&quot; type of self-interest. Ignorant self-interest seeks to promote itself and capitalize on its will-to-live. In contrast, enlightened self-interest humbles the individual and leads him to asceticism, as that aligns him properly with the elevating will-towards-death.

== Personality ==
It was noted by critics that his work reveals a gentle and warmhearted personality. Lucien Arréat expressed that many pages feel warm due to the &quot;generosity of his soul&quot;, and as a more general characterization that &quot;Mainländer had a delicate and sincere nature, a truly remarkable individuality.&quot; 

Frederick C. Beiser also notes &quot;Mainländer&#x27;s humanity&quot;: &quot;He had the deepest sympathy for the suffering of the common man and much of his thinking was preoccupied with the poverty of the mass of people and the workers. ... It is not the least token of Mainländer&#x27;s humanity that he was sympathetic to the Jews, whose charity and sagacity he much admired.&quot;

== Politics and political life ==
Philipp Mainländer praised the Buddha as a &quot;political-social reformer&quot; who fought against the caste system. 

Central to Mainländer&#x27;s activism is the belief that a truly pessimistic ethics must advocate for the dismantling of social and political structures that perpetuate inequality and suffering. He argues that the pursuit of social and political equality is a natural extension of the compassion that arises from recognizing existence as fundamentally evil. This perspective leads him to champion communism and a &quot;free love movement&quot; (&quot;freie Liebe&quot;) as essential components of a just society. Mainländer envisions a political landscape where communal ownership and collective responsibility replace individualistic pursuits, thereby fostering an environment conducive to the renunciation of the will to life.

Through such a free love movement, sexual and marital relations are redefined outside of their traditional constraints, and thus Mainländer argues that by abolishing marriage and traditional sexual roles, individuals can free themselves from the repressive structures that bind them to procreation and societal expectations. This liberation is crucial for both men and women to gain autonomy over their bodies and lives, allowing and empowering them to pursue the path of contemplation, asceticism, chastity, and ultimately, the renunciation of being through suicide. Mainländer views suicide not as an act of despair but as a rational choice that can alleviate suffering and serve as a profound expression of ethical virtue when approached with a clear understanding of the nature of existence.

In his view, communism serves as a vehicle for achieving social and economic equality, allowing individuals to transcend the selfish impulses inherent in the will to survive. By eliminating class distinctions and ensuring equal access to education and resources, Mainländer believes that society can cultivate a collective commitment to alleviating suffering. He posits that in a fully realized communist society, individuals would be liberated from the constraints of individual existence, enabling them to engage in acts of compassionate service to others, thus ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to confront and alleviate the suffering that arises from existence.

For Mainländer, such a communist state represents the penultimate step of the will to death&#x27;s metanarrative, where the satiation of all human desires leads to an understanding of the vanity and emptiness of existence (specifically, that the pleasures this satiation brings does not outweigh the negative value of existence), thus beginning a movement towards the extinction of humanity (and eventually of all matter in the universe).

The politics of Mainländer may have played a profound role in the philosopher&#x27;s suicide. Letters written to his sister, Minna Batz, imply that there was an indecision on his behalf as to whether suicide would be beneficial, or if he could work as a political leader in the Social Democratic Movement taking place within Germany at the time, in an effort to aid in accelerating society towards the aforementioned &quot;final state.&quot; In a letter to his sister, he writes:If I am not to seek death with pleasure, after this fruit has ripened, lacking any motive, I must enter into the realm of social democracy, which will allow me to become exhausted and dazed, so as not to listen to the seductive voices of this longing for absolute rest, and to achieve redemption forever. [...] Whether I shall prefer the repose of death to all this [active political life], and seal my doctrine with it, I do not know for the moment.The letters exchanged between them imply that Mainländer was seeking external support in the form of his sister&#x27;s blessing for his political career, but due to opposing political beliefs, she refused to bestow it. Despite this, Mainländer wrote that he would seek political activism without her blessing, and yet was found dead by hanging within a short period of time, proving that he had gone back on his original decision.

== Reception ==
Nietzsche immediately read &quot;Die Philosophie der Erlösung&quot; in the year it was published, before any review had appeared. The work contributed to his final separation from Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy. In his own works, Nietzsche gave no attention to Mainländer until a decade later, that is, in the second, expanded edition of &quot;The Gay Science&quot;, the same book in which he had introduced the phrase &quot;God is dead&quot; in the first edition five years prior: &quot;Could one count such dilettantes and old maids as the sickeningly sentimental apostle of virginity, Mainländer, as a genuine German? After all he was probably a Jew – (all Jews become sentimental when they moralize).&quot; It has been suggested that Mainländer was more than a mere influence, and was instead plagiarized.

Nietzsche also mentions in one of his letters that he met an adherent of Mainländer&#x27;s philosophy, &quot;a quiet and modest man, a &quot;Buddhist&quot; [...], passionate vegetarian.&quot; The &quot;modest man&quot; told Nietzsche that Mainländer was, in fact, not a Jew.

In the same period, Max Seiling wrote that he believed Mainländer to be one of the few wise heroes to have walked on this earth.

Mainländer&#x27;s work was not well received by authorities. In Imperial Russia, Mainländer&#x27;s essay on the esoteric meaning of the Trinity was banned. In the German Reichstag, &quot;Die Philosophie der Erlösung&quot; was brought up to the rostrum on occasion of the Anti-Socialist Laws. Prominent socialists however took interest in his work. The socialist leader August Bebel refers to and uses the arguments of the pessimistic philosopher in his feminist work &quot;Woman and Socialism&quot;. Bebel mentions Mainländer&#x27;s sister in his autobiography. Also Eduard Bernstein wrote that he was &quot;very interested&quot; in Mainländer. Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis (1846–1919), the first prominent Dutch socialist, considered Mainländer&#x27;s work a &quot;great contribution&quot; for socialism.

Alfred Kubin, one of the founders of Der Blaue Reiter, wrote about &quot;Die Philosophie der Erlösung&quot;, &quot;this work – which expresses my actual thoughts and steels and strengthens me – this philosophy, forms the consolation of my life and death.&quot;

The Japanese writer Akutagawa wrote in &quot;A Note to a Certain Old Friend&quot;, &quot;I read Mainländer, whose work has become deeply ingrained in my consciousness.&quot; He also refers to Mainländer in his novel &quot;Kappa&quot;.

Emil Cioran was very impressed by the work of Mainländer.

More recently, a number of contemporary pessimists, like Drew Dalton, have drawn from the work of Mainländer in the hopes of developing new models for ethical and political action.

The communist thinker Slavoj Žižek remarked: &quot;Today, in a society in which the striving for pleasure and happiness fully displays their self-destructive potential, only figures like Mainländer can save us.&quot;

<text>William Curry Holden (July 19, 1896 – April 21, 1993) was an American historian and archaeologist. In 1937, he became the first director of the Museum of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas.

==Early years, education, military==
Holden was one of three sons born to Robert Lee Holden and Grace Holden née Davis in Coolidge, Texas. Both families moved west to Colorado City, Texas, and after 1907 the Holdens farmed near Rotan, Texas, where William completed high school in 1914.

In summer 1914 he obtained teacher certification at the now-closed Stamford Junior College in Stamford, Texas. At first refused jobs because he was &quot;too spindly&quot;, in 1915 he became the only teacher for 47 students in nine classes at the one-room schoolhouse in Pleasant Valley. He organized a literary club and basketball teams and led the students to victory in the county interscholastic meeting.

Holden studied Texas history under Professor Joseph A. Hill at West Texas Normal College (now West Texas A&amp;M University) in Canyon, Texas, during the summers of 1917 and 1918. During World War I, Holden served in the Eighty-sixth United States Army Infantry at San Antonio.

==University of Texas and McMurry College==
After his military service, Holden obtained a job as principal at his &quot;alma mater&quot;, Rotan High School. However, he left the position soon thereafter and entered the University of Texas, where he eventually earned his bachelor&#x27;s (1923), master&#x27;s (1924), and PhD (1928) degrees. He also spent a summer each at the University of Chicago and the University of Colorado. In 1923, Holden became founding chairman of the history department at the newly established McMurry College (now McMurry University).

==Forty years at Texas Tech University==


In 1929, Holden joined the faculty of Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) to teach history and anthropology. He remained there for more than four decades, becoming chairman of the history department in 1936, dean and director of anthropological, historical, and social-science research in 1938, and in 1945, dean of the Graduate School, a position that he retained until 1950. He received the Distinguished Faculty Emeritus Award of the College of Arts and Sciences and, in 1965, was named Distinguished Director Emeritus of the Museum at Texas Tech University. Holden Hall, the original location of the museum and now used for classrooms and offices, was named in his honor in 1972.

===Building the Museum of Texas Tech University===

In 1935, Holden organized the West Texas Museum Association and sought funds from the Texas Centennial Commission for the West Texas Museum (now known as the Museum of Texas Tech University).

In 1955, Holden, J. Evetts Haley, and other historians organized the Southwest Collection and Archives, which contained West Texas ranch records.

==Archeological excavations==
Excavations undertaken in 1930 and 1931 in the Panhandle uncovered Saddleback and Antelope Creek Phase ruins on the Canadian River. In 1932, Holden directed a field school at the Tecolote ruin near Las Vegas, New Mexico. In 1933, 1935, and 1937, he and his students excavated and restored the Early Glaze-period Arrowhead Ruin east of Santa Fe, New Mexico, including a rare D-shaped kiva.

Holden&#x27;s most significant archeological discovery occurred in 1937, when two of his students found a Paleo-Indian flint point in Yellow House Draw. Holden played a major role in the long struggle to preserve the site, which was finally in 1989 designated the Lubbock Lake National Historic and State Archeological Landmark.

Holden led archeological field trips to Mexico in 1934, 1936, 1938, and 1940. In 1934 he took students on an expedition to Sonora to study the Yaqui, and the university sponsored a second expedition the following year, leading to the book &quot;Studies of the Yaqui Indians of Sonora, Mexico&quot; (1936), for which Holden was primary author, writing five articles.

==Marriages and later years==
Holden was twice married. His first wife, Olive Price Holden (1903–1937), died eleven years after their marriage. She studied anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin, where she became a student of southwestern cultures and adobe construction. While at Texas Tech, she worked at the library as an instructor and a reference librarian and helped to organize the early program for the Tech Anthropology Department. She established the Koshari social club for women, which became Phi Beta Phi. She was instrumental in designing and spurring the construction of the adobe residential complex south of campus. A Texas Tech memorial fund, the Olive Price Holden Memorial Endowment, underwrites the purchase of books for the Southwest Collect and Special Collections Library.

On March 26, 1939, Holden married Frances Virginia &quot;Fran&quot; Holden née Mayhugh.

Holden retired from Texas Tech in 1970. During his retirement, he and Frances built the Adobe Row neighborhood of houses in Lubbock, Pueblo-revival style, to serve as inexpensive accommodations for faculty and students at Texas Tech. These buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places and are designated as state and city archaeological and historic landmarks.

Holden died on April 21, 1993, at the age of ninety-six.

William and Frances Holden are interred in the family plot with his parents and first wife at the City of Lubbock Cemetery. Frances&#x27;s grave is not specifically marked. They were Methodist.

<text>Amiel Muki Daemion (born 13 August 1979), also known as just Amiel, is an American-born Australian pop singer, songwriter and actress. She moved to Australia with her family at the age of two and starred in films in the 1990s, including &quot;The Silver Brumby&quot;, which also starred Russell Crowe and Caroline Goodall. Her music career shot to fame in 1999 when she teamed up with producer Josh G. Abrahams (as Puretone) for the song &quot;Addicted to Bass&quot; which became a top twenty hit in Australia, this led to Daemion releasing studio albums such as &quot;Audio Out&quot; in 2003 and &quot;These Ties&quot; in 2005.

==Biography==
===Early career===
Born in New York City, United States, Daemion was raised in a musical household, with her parents being musicians. Her father was a musician, composer and vocalist. Daemion states &quot;ever since I was a little girl he [her father] would have musical instruments around. He really encouraged me to do what I&#x27;m doing.&quot; Her mother was a singer as well, Daemion states &quot;she [her mother] used to play guitar and write songs with her sister. I remember being about four and listening to her Janis Ian records and singing along and learning all the words.&quot; Daemion&#x27;s first three records she bought were John Lennon, De La Soul and Mariah Carey, where she felt that Carey&#x27;s album was &quot;overproduced&quot;. She wrote and recorded her first song at the age of nine in an effort to help spread the message of ecological awareness. Daemion states &quot;I&#x27;d seen a documentary. I turned to Dad and said why? and he had no answer for me so I thought if I wrote a song then maybe I could help the cause. I sang it into a tape recorder. Dad heard it and said &#x27;do you realize what you&#x27;ve just done?&#x27; I said &#x27;no.&#x27; He said: &#x27;Amiel, you&#x27;ve written a song.&quot; She was introduced to the world of entertainment at the age of eleven performing the leading role alongside Russell Crowe in the feature film &quot;The Silver Brumby&quot;. She states &quot;I always knew that all I wanted to do was perform.&quot;

===1995–2003: Collaborations with Josh Abrahams and debut album===
Daemion&#x27;s music career began in 1995 when she was hired to do some backing vocals on a song the Australian producer Josh Abrahams was producing. Instead of just singing the song, she included her harmonies, melodies and lyrics and sang only two takes for Abrahams who then offered her a career in music. They released their first single together called &quot;Addicted to Bass&quot; in 1998. The song had success and peaked in the top twenty on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart and was nominated for two ARIA Awards at the 1999 awards for &quot;Single of the Year&quot; and &quot;Best Video&quot; but lost to &quot;The Day You Come&quot; by Powderfinger and &quot;Girls Like That...&quot; by Custard. With the success of &quot;Addicted to Bass&quot;, Daemion was then given a solo recording contract in 1998 at the age of nineteen with Festival Records and decided that Abrahams would be the best producer for her debut album. 
Daemion was confronted by delays while making the record and refused to be bothered by the record&#x27;s slow progress, so she used this time to write new songs both in Australia and in the United States where she composed and recorded a song, &quot;Meet Me in the Red Room&quot;, for the second &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; soundtrack with Marius De Vries, under the direction of Baz Luhrmann. The new songs Daemion worked with changed the direction of the record and while a couple of the very early songs remained, the songs that were written during this period were replaced by the first demos. Daemion states &quot;As I learnt more about the recording process and worked with different people my writing evolved and my vision for the record expanded.&quot; What started out as a small independent record, it turned into a full-scale production and Daemion&#x27;s record became a major priority for her record company, which had merged to become Festival Mushroom Records since she had been signed.

In 2002, due to the success of &quot;Addicted to Bass&quot; in Australia and New Zealand, Abrahams and Daemion collaborated to form the band Puretone to release the song around the world. The song became a hit around the globe peaking at number two in the United Kingdom with the help of a remixed form by Apollo 440 and number-one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play. Abrahams and Daemion released a second single as Puretone named &quot;Stuck in a Groove&quot; which became a minor hit around the world. They also wrote the music for a Vodafone television commercial that was nominated for &quot;Best Music for an Advertisement&quot; at the 2002 APRA Screen Awards. Daemion released her first single, &quot;Lovesong&quot;, in March 2003 and became the most added song to Australian radio upon its release and was one of the most play song on Australian radio for 2003. It became Daemion&#x27;s first solo top ten single in Australia. Her debut album, &quot;Audio Out&quot;, was released in Australia on 18 August 2003 and she states it is her weird take on the world. The album debuted in the top twenty on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by ARIA. Due to the positive reception review and chart wise, Daemion was nominated for five ARIA Awards at the 2003 awards for &quot;Single of the Year&quot; and &quot;Highest Selling Single&quot; for &quot;Lovesong&quot; and &quot;Best Female Artist&quot;, &quot;Breakthrough Artist – Album&quot; and &quot;Best Pop Release&quot; for &quot;Audio Out&quot;.

===2004–2007: &quot;These Ties&quot;, label break-up and &quot;Be Your Girl&quot;===
During the promotion of &quot;Audio Out&quot; in 2004 in London, Daemion went out on the search for a new producer and came across Stephen Lironi, an ex-member of the UK band Altered Images. Daemion states that she &quot;felt comfortable with him straight away. I felt like he got what I was trying to do creatively.&quot; After a few short months of working with Lironi, Daemion felt that her second solo album, &quot;These Ties&quot;, was born. Just as the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Round and Round&quot;, was released, it had been announced that the recording assets of the Festival Mushroom group had been acquired by Warner Music. Everything at Warner Music came to a temporary standstill while it was slowly adjusted by its new entity. While staff and artists at Festival Mushroom Records started being dropped all around her, Daemion made the agreement to postpone the release of &quot;These Ties&quot; until &quot;the dust had settled&quot;. &quot;These Ties&quot; was released in Japan on 19 October 2005 and failed to reach the top twenty success that &quot;Audio Out&quot; received.

In 2005, she performed the lead vocals on The Blips song &quot;Green Eyed World&quot;, which was featured on the soundtrack of the 2005 film &quot;Hating Alison Ashley&quot;. In addition, she released an electroclash cover of the Split Enz song &quot;One Step Ahead&quot; on the Finn Brothers tribute album &quot;She Will Have Her Way&quot; which was released also in 2005. A few months later, the dust did settle down for Warner Music. &quot;These Ties&quot; Australian release date had to be pulled back many times so Daemion and Warner Music both agreed that it was no longer her new album and to try to come back where they had left off halfway through a release would be impossible. Daemion and Warner Music decided to work on an &quot;in between&quot; project, which was to take Daemion&#x27;s &quot;These Ties&quot; song, &quot;Be Your Girl&quot;, and form it into an EP of remixed songs from the album. Daemion states that she &quot;wanted to find a fun and positive way to use these songs.&quot; She decided to collaborate with some of Australia and New Zealand&#x27;s hip hop and dance producers, and the &#x27;Bass Kleph&#x27; version of the song was released to Australian radio to promote the EP.

===2008–present: Current activities===
During November 2008, Daemion announced that she had been released from the Warner Records label. She stated &quot;It may sound strange to all you budding artists out there – that I would try for so long to get out of my contract – when you would give anything just to get one..but there are indeed, always two sides to every coin.&quot;

She then set up a home studio and is working with her producer brother Romy Handley (who produces under the title Whisper).

The aircraft is based on the Lockheed P-3 Orion airframe, but mounts the electronics suite of the Lockheed S-3 Viking. &quot;Aurora&quot; refers to the Roman goddess of dawn who flies across the sky each morning ahead of the sun. Aurora also refers to the Aurora Borealis, the &quot;northern lights&quot;, that are prominent over northern Canada and the Arctic Ocean.

The CP-140A Arcturus was a related variant used primarily for pilot training and coastal surface patrol missions.

==Design and development==
The CP-140 Aurora is very similar externally to the Lockheed P-3C Orion (Canadian ESM wingtip pods instead of the American ESM wing pod), but is different internally, using two sets of mission systems that were first installed in yet another Lockheed anti-submarine warfare aircraft, the carrier-based S-3A Viking. The aircraft&#x27;s sensors are primarily intended for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) work but are also capable of maritime surveillance, counter-drug and search-and-rescue missions. The CP-140 is Canada&#x27;s only strategic Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, conducting long range missions over land, water and littoral areas. These missions are flown in support of Canadian Joint Operations Command, the RCMP, and several other federal government departments.

In 1991, Lockheed shut down its production lines in Burbank, California, for the P-3 Orion, which shares the same airframe with the CP-140. Three surplus airframes on hand were purchased by the Air Command, but delivered without the anti-submarine fit. These three aircraft were designated the CP-140A Arcturus and were used primarily for pilot training and coastal surface patrol missions.

===Aurora Incremental Modernization Project===
The Aurora Incremental Modernization Project (AIMP), initiated in 1998 to upgrade electronics of the Aurora fleet was halted by the government on 20 September 2007 to evaluate whether the aging fleet should continue to be upgraded or replaced by more modern aircraft. On 18 December 2007 the Department of National Defence rescinded this work suspension so that the project could continue. Work includes upgrading computer, navigation, communication and radar systems as well as making structural improvements to ten of eighteen aircraft. The intent of the modernization project is to &quot;keep the aircraft safe and operationally viable until 2020&quot;.

AIMP is currently divided into four &quot;blocks&quot;. Block I is complete and concentrated on the replacement of unsupportable systems. Block II brought a glass cockpit with the Navigation and Flight Instruments (NFI) component provided by CMC Electronics, and a complete replacement of the communications suite. Block III is currently in progress, and is a wholesale replacement of the aircraft&#x27;s sensors and mission computer. Block IV will consist of further upgrades to the tactical compartment and mission systems.

Once AIMP was completed the CP-140 was designated as CP-140M.

===Aurora Structural Life Extension Program===
The Aurora Structural Life Extension Project (ASLEP) is proceeding with 14 of the 18 Auroras scheduled to receive new wings and the replacement of key structural components. The complete ASLEP solution replaces the aircraft&#x27;s outer wings, centre wing lower section and horizontal stabilizers with new production components. All fatigue-life limiting structures on the aircraft are replaced with enhanced-design components and improved corrosion-resistant materials that will greatly reduce maintenance costs over the aircraft&#x27;s service life. This program is expected to extend the CP140s&#x27; service life by 15,000 flight hours per airframe.

==Operational history==

===CP-140 Aurora===
The Aurora was acquired in the early 1980s to replace the CP-107 Argus and to further support Canada&#x27;s anti-submarine warfare mission obligations under NATO for the northwest Atlantic sector. Short deployments to Alaska (Adak), Hawaii (Kaneohe Bay), Iceland (Keflavik), the UK (St Mawgan and Kinloss), and Norway (Andoya) were the norm. However, since the end of the Cold War, they have been used primarily in coastal surveillance and sovereignty patrols by providing an all-weather mission surveillance platform. Increasingly, as the CP-140 moves into the 21st century, it is employed for domestic and international surveillance by CANCOM for security, counter-terrorism and smuggling, as well as to monitor foreign fishing fleets off Canada&#x27;s coasts. CP-140s have also been deployed on operations such as Operation Assistance and Operation Apollo.

Deployments have included OP SHARPGUARD (Yugoslavia blockade), OP SIRIUS (Mediterranean Patrols), OP APOLLO (Persian Gulf region), and counter-narcotics patrols in the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific. Through all this, patrols of the Canadian Arctic continue to take advantage of the airframe&#x27;s unique abilities.

In 2011 and 2012, CP-140 aircraft performed maritime patrol missions in the Libyan waters to help in the enforcement of the no-fly zone over Libya under Operation Odyssey Dawn and Operation Unified Protector.

As of January 2017, two CP-140s were conducting overland surveillance missions against ISIL as part of Operation Impact. However one aircraft was withdrawn in May 2017.

From October 2018, due to support the implementation of United Nations Security Council sanctions imposed against North Korea, Canadian Armed Forces deploy periodically a Canadian frigate and/or a CP-140 Aurora on Operation Neon. In June 2022 it was reported that Chinese jets had repeatedly intercepted the Aurora in a manner which the Canada military said failed to adhere to international air safety norms. Some of these intercepts forced the Aurora to change its flight path to avoid collision with the intercepting aircraft. Canadian government officials said the incidents were happening with increasing frequency and that they had lodged protests on multiple occasions with their Chinese counterparts, although an article by Global News said that China is not believed to have responded to the reprimands as the interceptions had not stopped continuing. On October 16, 2023, during a Canadian reconnaissance flight over international waters as part of a United Nations resolution to stop illegal oil shipments to North Korea, Chinese fighter jets intercepted the Aurora for multiple hours over the course of the Aurora&#x27;s flight. One of the fighter jets behaved in an &quot;aggressive manner&quot; by flying back and forth in close proximity and flying with the Canadian plane within its blind spot, and firing off flares from near the front of the plane.

In February 2023, as a result of recent violence and unrest, a CP-140 was deployed to Haiti to help &quot;disrupt the activities of gangs&quot; by providing surveillance and intelligence. Separately, a CP-140 collaborated with USAF F-22 Raptors to intercept and down an unidentified object over Yukon Territory.

===CP-140A Arcturus===
Lacking the expensive, heavy and sensitive anti-submarine warfare as well as the anti-surface warfare fittings of the CP-140 Aurora, the Arcturus was more fuel efficient and was used for crew training duties (such as &quot;touch-and-go&quot; landing practice), general maritime surface reconnaissance (detecting drug operations, smuggling of illegal immigrants, fisheries protection patrols, pollution monitoring, etc.), search-and-rescue assistance and Arctic sovereignty patrols. The Arcturus did possess a superior AN/APS-507 surface search radar, incorporating modern functions such as track-while-scan that the Aurora&#x27;s AN/APS-506 radar lacks but the Arcturus did not have an integrated mission computer, or mission systems. It did, however, maintain the same military communications suite as the CP-140 Aurora.

All three aircraft were based at 14 Wing. Upon retirement from flying operations, one was used for technician training with 404 Long Range Patrol and Training Squadron on base CFB Greenwood, Nova Scotia, before being moved to the Greenwood Military Aviation Museum on base. The last two of the CP-140As were retired in 2011 when they were delivered to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group (AMARG) in Tucson, Arizona.

===Replacement===
Several options had been suggested for a CP-140M replacement. These included the Boeing P-8 Poseidon and the Raytheon Sentinel, based on the Bombardier Global Express-6500, as well as late entrant PAL Aerospace Global Express 6500-based P-6.

The RCAF had planned to downsize the fleet from eighteen to fourteen aircraft, with three already being withdrawn and a fourth test aircraft to be retired in the near future. The retirement of the CP-140 was originally expected around 2030, and could have resulted in a capability gap as the RCAF did not anticipate replacements to be delivered until 2032 to 2038. The RCAF&#x27;s Weapon System Manager (WSM) had prepared plans to have the CP-140M operational until 2035 to 2040.

On March 28, 2023, the Government of Canada sent a Letter of Request to the US&#x27;s Foreign Military Sales program to approve the purchase sixteen P-8A to replace the current CP-140 fleet, but it did not indicate any timeline for delivery. On June 27, 2023, the US Congress approved the LOR for the Canada to acquire the P-8.

On November 30, 2023, Minister of National Defence Bill Blair announced the acquisition of sixteen P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the Royal Canadian Air Force. This acquisition is initially set for fourteen aircraft, with an option of two additional aircraft. It is anticipated by the Department of National Defence that the first aircraft will be delivered in 2026, with full operational capacity by 2033.

<text>Grindelwald is a village and municipality in the Interlaken-Oberhasli administrative district in the canton of Berne. In addition to the village of Grindelwald, the municipality also includes the settlements of Alpiglen, Burglauenen, Grund, Itramen, Mühlebach, Schwendi, Tschingelberg and Wargistal.

Grindelwald village is above sea level. Mentioned for the first time in 1146, it has become an important tourist destination of both Switzerland and the Alps since the golden age of alpinism in the 19th century. It is overlooked by a section of the Bernese Alps from the Wetterhorn to the Eiger, which creates a natural barrier. Together with the adjacent valley of Lauterbrunnen, the valley of Grindelwald forms part of the Jungfrau Region of the Bernese Oberland, between Interlaken and the main crest of the Bernese Alps.

Similarly to Lauterbrunnen, Grindelwald is connected to Interlaken by the Bernese Oberland Railway and is the start of the Wengernalp Railway, leading to Kleine Scheidegg. The latter resort is the start of the Jungfrau Railway, the highest railway in Europe and a gateway to the Jungfrau-Aletsch protected area.

==History==
Grindelwald was first mentioned in 1146 as &quot;Grindelwalt&quot;. This designation is probably derived from the Old High German words &quot;grintil&quot; (bar, barrier) and &quot;walt&quot; (forest), thus describing the nature of the valley. According to a legend, the name Grindelwald comes from two monks of the Interlaken Monastery. After exploring the Lütschinen valleys, they are said to have reported about &quot;Grinden&quot; and &quot;Wald&quot;, i.e. &quot;stones&quot; and &quot;forests&quot;. This was initially the explanation for the origin of the name.


The oldest traces of a settlement in the area are scattered neolithic tools which have been discovered around Grindelwald village. Several Roman era coins have also been found in the municipality. A castle was built on the Burgbühl hill above the village during the High Middle Ages.

In 1146, King Conrad III granted estates in Grindelwald to Interlaken Monastery. In the late 12th century, the barons of the alpine valleys in what became the Berner Oberland went to war against the expansionist Duke Berthold V of Zähringen. The Duke defeated a coalition of nobles in the Grindlewald valley in 1191. His victory allowed him to expand Zähringen power into the Oberland, to expand the city of Thun and found the city of Bern. Beginning in the 13th century, Interlaken Monastery began to purchase rights and land in Grindelwald and eventually forced the local nobles out of the valley. The Monastery continued to exert influence in the village and in 1315 and again in 1332 ordered the villagers to raid Unterwalden to further the political ambitions of the Abbot&#x27;s patrons. In response to the raids, in 1342, Unterwalden attacked Grindelwald. A few years later, in 1348–49, the villagers joined in an unsuccessful rebellion against ecclesiastical power. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the Protestant Reformation and proceeded to spread the new faith in Grindelwald against the populations&#x27; wishes. Berne was able to impose its will, converted the village and secularized Interlaken Abbey and the Abbey&#x27;s lands. Grindelwald became part of the bailiwick of Interlaken, under a Bernese bailiff.

The first village church was a wooden building from the mid-12th century. The wooden building was replaced with the stone St. Mary&#x27;s Church in 1180. This church was replaced in the 16th century, and the present church was built in 1793. On August 18, 1892, a large part of the village was destroyed by a fire. That day, which followed a drought period, a violent foehn storm was raging. Within two hours, 116 buildings in the Grindelwald valley were destroyed and 412 residents became homeless.
The tourism industry began in Grindelwald in the late 18th century as foreigners discovered the scenic town. Pictures of the vistas were widely reprinted, quickly making the village internationally famous. In the 19th century many Englishmen came to the village to climb the alpine peaks around the valley. The Finsteraarhorn (), the Wetterhorn (), the Eiger (), the Schreckhorn () and the Gross Fiescherhorn () were all climbed during the 19th century, an ascent of the Wetterhorn marking the beginning of the golden age of alpinism. The ascent of the north face of the Eiger, in 1938, was also a milestone in mountaineering history.

The Grindelwald road was built in 1860–72, and the Bernese Oberland railway reached the village in 1890, both of which transformed an arduous journey into a simple trip and allowed tourists to flood into the village. In 1888, Grindelwald was the first resort in the Bernese Oberland to also become a winter destination, attractions being sleigh rides, curling, skating and, from 1891, skiing. The first resort opened in 1888, there were 10 hotels in 1889, and by 1914 there were 33 in Grindelwald. A rack railway was built to Kleine Scheidegg in 1893, and it was expanded to the Jungfraujoch in 1912. Numerous ski lifts, cable cars, hiking trails and alpine huts were built in the late 19th and 20th centuries to allow tourists to explore the mountains, notably the Wetterhorn Elevator, one of the first modern aerial tramways. Today, almost the entire economy of Grindelwald is based on tourism. The V-cableway, inaugurated in 2020, is the last major development in the valley.

The Grindelwald region has been the subject of scientific investigations, including in the &quot;Alpine Studies&quot; by the English alpinist W. A. B. Coolidge (1912) and in the Unesco research program Man and Biosphere of the Geographical Institute of the University of Bern on the effects of tourism (1979–1984).

==Flag and coat of arms==
Grindelwald&#x27;s current flag and coat of arms was introduced in 1994. The one the municipality had used before, dating from the 14th century, was the same as Austria&#x27;s: three horizontal stripes of red-white-red.

The blazon of the new coat of arms is: &quot;Gules, on a bar argent a semi chamois rampant issuant sable between seven (4-3) mullets of the second.&quot;

==Geography==

<text>A nightgown, nightie or nightdress is a loosely hanging item of nightwear, and is commonly worn by women and girls. A nightgown is made from cotton, silk, satin, or nylon and may be decorated with lace appliqués or embroidery at the bust and hem.

A nightgown may have any neckline, and may have sleeves of any type, or be sleeveless, and any shoulder strap or back style. The length of a nightgown may vary from hip-length to floor-length. A short nightgown can be called a &quot;shortie&quot; or a &quot;babydoll&quot;, depending on the style. The sweep (taper from top to bottom) of the night gown can vary from virtually straight, to full circle sweep, like the Olga gown. A slip nightgown may be used as a nightgown or as a full slip. Nightgowns may be worn with a matching outer garment such as a robe, a sheer chiffon peignoir, or a dressing gown, to make them appropriate for receiving guests.

== History ==
=== Early nightgowns ===
The &quot;Dictionary of Fashion History&quot; highlights the use of the term &quot;nightgown&quot; as early as 1530, when French linguist John Palsgrave translates &quot;sloppe&quot; to nightgown in his own textbook. There is no indication whether the term referred to sleepwear or an item of clothing with a different purpose, however. There, additionally, is little evidence of designated sleepwear prior to the 16th century. European portraiture from the Middle Ages suggests men and women commonly slept naked, sometimes with a nightcap. Some historians suggest a lack of record of early sleepwear is due to social attitudes. Sleepwear was widely regarded as a private matter within households until it became more popularized.

Modern nightgowns originate from nightshirts on men, or night-chemises on women which date back to as early as the 16th century. Nightshirts and night-chemises tended to just be day shirts or undergarments and were similarly ankle-length, shapeless articles with varying collars. Nightshirts resembled tunics; worn by both sexes for centuries in Egypt and Rome. They tended to be made from white linen so as to be easily washed and absorbent. Nobles and Lords however wore nightshirts that were embroidered.

It was not until the late 17th century that sleepwear developed its own identity in Western Europe, and higher-class women began to wear chemise-like gowns exclusively to bed, known as nightshifts. Nightshifts developed more shape when the negligée was born in France in the early 18th century. The negligée was typically made with soft-sheer fabric and was tighter around the waist, but still loose-fitting for comfort.  It was also a sign of wealth and is regarded as the first women&#x27;s nightwear to be used widely and a predecessor to the modern nightgown. According to historians Willet and Phillis Cunnington, only small adjustments were made to nightdresses up until the late 19th century because of social attitudes; trimmings of lace or tighter fits were viewed &quot;as a sign of depravity that went against the highest principles of prudery in the English lady&quot;.

=== Nightgowns as dressing gowns: 18th and early 19th centuries ===

Prior to the late 19th century, the term &quot;nightgown&quot; referred not to sleepwear but rather to informal wear. The nightgown was a &quot;version of a modern dressing gown&quot; and tended to be worn around the house or to occasions when formal attire was not necessary. This garment was actually a Banyan, a T-shirt shaped robe adopted by the British from India but became known as a &quot;nightgown&quot;, dressing gown or &quot;morning gown&quot; in the early 1700s due to its casual nature.

Nightgowns, or dressing gowns, were predominantly worn by men. English variations of the nightgown or dressing gown were influenced by similar gowns from India, Japan and the Middle East. In the early 18th century, the kimono style became popular. It was loose fitting and fit over men like a coat. The gown &quot;consists of two widths of fabric seamed at center back up to the neck, where it joins a small rectangle of fabric to build up the neckline. Each width of fabric then falls over the shoulders to create the gown front. Additional widths of fabric form the sleeves. V-shaped inserts could be sewn at the side seams for additional fullness.&quot;

Nightgowns were also typically made from cotton or silk (damask, brocade, velvet, taffeta, and satin) or wool with linings using satin or lutestring in a bright, contrasting color. The material varied based on the weather and the person wearing the gown. In colder seasons, nightgowns would have fur linings. Trade throughout Europe and Asia from the 16th to 18th centuries led to the foreign fabrics and styles used for nightgowns in Western Europe and America. Exotic associations popularized the nightgown, especially in the kimono or banyan style. Fashion historian Patricia Cunningham has also suggested “the cut of the gown may derive from Persian and Turkish caftans”.

Nightgowns or dressing gowns also increased in demand because of portraiture and implications of status. The garment is seen throughout portraits in the 17th and 18th centuries. &quot;The adoption of the gown by the English may date from the 16th century when Henry VIII wore what appears to be an Islamic caftan with frogged closure for a portrait by Holbein&quot;. Cunningham points to paintings &quot;The Apothecary&#x27;s Shop&quot; (1752) and &quot;The Concert&quot; (1741) which &quot;illustrate the apparent appropriateness of the gown for both professional and social occasions&quot;.

=== 19th and 20th centuries ===

From 1840 to 1900, stylistic changes were made to nightgowns&#x27; necklines, collars, sleeves, bodices and closures. &quot;Embellishments such as frills, ruffles, tucks, ribbons, lace, beading, openwork and embroidery would often be added to necklines, collars, bodices, sleeves, cuffs, and skirts.&quot; The traditional nightshirt was replaced by pyjamas amongst the Western world when it was adopted from India in 1870. Pyjamas soon became an essential item in men&#x27;s wardrobes because of their comfort and exotic connotations. Female pyjamas were introduced in 1886 and were a combination of a nightgown and pants &quot;that required 4 ½ yards of calico or flannel fabric. The top had a high collar and a buttoned-down front, and there were frills at the wrists and at the knees.&quot; French designer Coco Chanel was the first to release a line of attractive women&#x27;s pyjamas which coaxed along their popularity.

Despite the introduction of pyjamas, the popularity of the nightgown grew drastically in the 1920s. Between 1920 and 1940, nightgowns did not curve the body but draped down in a straight line. This is widely attributed to French designer Madeleine Vionnet who rejected corsets and became famous &quot;cutting fabric along the bias&quot;. Her styles accentuated curves while also providing fluidity and comfort. During this time, nightgowns also moved from domestic use to fashion statements. In 1933, trend setter Mary d&#x27;Erlanger wore a nightgown cut low in the front and back to a ball in New York popularizing the elegance of the style. This style, now referred to as the &quot;slip dress&quot; made a resurgence in the 1990s. The middle of the 19th century saw more tailored nightgowns which were full skirted with figure-hugging bodices, reflecting trends of the time. By the 1960s, nightgowns were completely diversified, found in varieties of lengths, patterns, and fabrics.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, nightgowns are predominantly worn by women. Common modern nightgown styles are made from cotton, satin, silk or lace and have embroidery or lace details with thin shoulder straps. Nightgowns have several different variations. Longer, cotton nightgowns are often referred to as &quot;Victorian Nightgowns&quot;, having been influenced by similar styles in the late 19th century. Shorter nightgowns are also known as &quot;nighties&quot; and a common style is the &quot;babydoll&quot; nightgown which is generally lace and silk with a V-neckline. Other variations are the &quot;shirt style&quot; nightgown or the &quot;slip dress&quot; nightgown.

The variety of styles of nightgowns have pushed into daywear and are also often seen on the runway. Nightgown influence has been seen in street style clothes as well as high fashion. In the 1990s, designer Calvin Klein developed a line of nightgown style dresses which were simple, silk gowns that were short or reached the floor. As recently as 2019, actor Gwyneth Paltrow wore a sheer yellow lace nightgown on the red carpet at the Met Gala with a high neck and filled collar much like one from the 19th century. Other trends like beach slip tunics have been linked to the first variations of the nightgown, or nightdress, in the 17th and 18th centuries. Some scholars suggest that as daywear has become more relaxed over time, it has allowed for the nightgown to be repurposed into different styles people wear every day.

<text>The Longhorn or British Longhorn is a British breed of beef cattle characterised by long curving horns. It originated in northern England, in the counties of Lancashire, Westmorland and Yorkshire, and later spread to the English Midlands and to Ireland. It was originally a slow heavy draught animal; cows gave a little milk, although high in fat. In the eighteenth century Robert Bakewell applied his methods of selective breeding to these cattle, which for a short time became the predominant British breed. Both the numbers and the quality of the breed declined throughout the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth. A breed society was formed in 1878, and a herd-book published in that year.

The Longhorn was formerly listed as &quot;priority&quot; on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, but in 2021 was listed among the &quot;UK native breeds&quot;.

The cattle are variable in colour, but are always finched – with a heavy line of white along the spine, tail and underside of the belly.

== History ==
The ancestors of the Longhorn originated in northern England, principally in the northern part of Lancashire, in southern Westmorland and in Yorkshire, particularly in the Craven district of the West Riding. They later spread to the English Midlands and to Ireland. 

The Longhorn was originally a slow heavy draught animal; cows gave a little milk, although high in fat. In the eighteenth century Robert Bakewell, of Dishley in Leicestershire, applied his methods of selective breeding to these cattle; his &quot;Dishley Longhorn&quot; was highly successful, and for a short time became the predominant British breed. After his death in 1795 it began to decline, and within a short time was supplanted by the Shorthorn as the principal breed in the country. Both the numbers and the quality of the breed decreased throughout the nineteenth century and for much of the twentieth. A breed society was formed in 1878, and a herd-book published in that year.

The Longhorn was formerly listed as &quot;priority&quot; on the watchlist of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust, but in 2021 was listed among the &quot;UK native breeds&quot;.

Some of the cattle have been exported to countries outside the British Isles. They are present in Australia, and there are small numbers in Holland and New Zealand. A population in Belgium appears to have become extinct.

== Characteristics ==

The cattle are variable in colour, but are always finched – with a heavy line of white along the spine, tail and underside of the belly.

== Use ==

The Longhorn was originally a slow heavy draught animal, used for ploughing; the milk yield was not high, but the milk was rich in fat and from the eighteenth century was used for cheese-making, particularly in Cheshire. As with other draught breeds, oxen at the end of their working lives could be fattened and sent for slaughter.

In the twenty-first century the cattle are reared principally for beef. They are also used for vegetation management in nature parks and Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

<text>The CASBY Awards were a Canadian awards ceremony for independent and alternative music, presented annually by Toronto, Ontario radio station CFNY, currently branded as 102.1 The Edge. CASBY is an acronym for Canadian Artists Selected By You.

The awards were first presented in 1981 under the name U-Knows, a pun on Canada&#x27;s mainstream Juno Awards. The concept was developed by David Marsden, the program director at CFNY at the time, when he heard the Juno nominations announced on CBC radio, and included was Long John Baldry — who was newly resident in Canada but had already been in the music business for almost 20 years — as most promising vocalist.

They were renamed the CASBYs in 1985, after a listener contest. The 1985 ceremony, hosted by Carole Pope and Paul Shaffer, also marked the first time that the awards were broadcast nationally by CBC Television. In the first year, voter ballots were distributed exclusively by the Canadian music magazine &quot;Graffiti&quot;. In later years the awards expanded the distribution, printing ballots in a number of major market daily newspapers across Canada.

The 1987 ceremony featured a rare public performance by XTC, although their performance was videotaped in advance of the ceremony. That year&#x27;s awards were also marred by several organizational snafus, including the wrong winner being initially announced for Album of the Year.

The award&#x27;s bid for national prominence faltered in the late 1980s, particularly after CFNY&#x27;s short-lived shift to a more mainstream music format also affected public perception of the awards&#x27; identity. During that era, some alienated listeners even picketed the awards ceremony. Beginning in 1993 the awards were pared down to just three categories, and after 1996, amid a sense that the awards had effectively lost their purpose, the awards were discontinued.

They were then revived in 2002, and were presented each year until 2017.

<text>The Last Book in the Universe is a 2000 post-apocalyptic science fiction novel by Rodman Philbrick. Set in a cyberpunk dystopia, its protagonist and narrator is a teenage boy named Spaz who has epilepsy.

==Plot summary==
The story is set in a dystopian future city somewhere in the United States, called the Urb, which has been disturbed by an earthquake known as &quot;The Big Shake.&quot; The Urb is plagued by poverty, thieves, gang warfare, and the use of mind probes. Mind probes are analogous to hard drugs and enable users to temporarily escape reality through images projected in the head. Genetically improved people, called &quot;proovs&quot;, (a play on &quot;improved&quot;) live in a city called Eden, with a beautiful society, food, and water. Eden is separated from the Urb by the &quot;Forbidden Zone,&quot; a deadly and dangerous minefield. The Urb is split up into sections called &quot;latches.&quot; Each latch is controlled by a gang. Spaz is a teenage boy who cannot use mind probes because of his epilepsy, causing his family to abandon him. Spaz runs errands for Billy Bizmo, the latch-boss (leader) of his gang, the &quot;Bully Bangers,&quot; in a section of the Urb. On one of his errands, Spaz is sent to &quot;rip-off&quot; (steal from) Ryter, a very old man who possesses the lost arts of literacy and literature.

Spaz soon meets Little Face, a five-year-old orphan who only says the word &quot;chox&quot;, because he didn&#x27;t learn how to speak and Spaz first gave him to eat. Spaz also meets Lanaya, a , who charitably gives out &quot;edibles&quot; (food) to Spaz. Ryter understands Spaz&#x27;s situation and does his best to help him, offering no resistance when Spaz attempts to steal his belongings. Eventually, Spaz learns that Bean, his beloved adoptive sister, is dying of leukemia. Ryter and Little Face accompany Spaz on a journey to find Bean. The trio starts by traveling through &quot;the Pipe,&quot; a large, rusted-out water pipe that leads to other latches. In the next latch, the group sees everything burning and finds Lanaya being attacked by very hungry people. Lanaya is rescued by Spaz and Ryter, and she joins them on their journey. The group starts traveling towards the latch where Bean lives and eventually find her as well. Lanaya and Ryter decide to take Bean to Eden, along with Spaz and Little Face. They ride along in Lanaya&#x27;s to her &quot;contributors&quot; (parents), Jin and Bree&#x27;s home, which is a castle in Eden.

At this point in the novel, it is brought to attention that Lanaya is a special who has been bred to eventually become a Master of Eden. To assume this title, she has rights and privileges that other do not, which are called &quot;learning opportunities&quot;. They take Bean to a hospital called the Primary and she is cured of her sickness using gene therapy. Ryter, Spaz, and Little Face enjoy the paradise of Eden. Ryter, Spaz and Bean are then thrown out of Eden because the elders who rule over Eden decide they are unacceptable. Little Face is secretly adopted by Lanaya&#x27;s contributors. The elders disregard Bean&#x27;s high intelligence and still discriminate against . Lanaya reveals to the elders that the mind probes, which come from Eden, cause too much damage to the people who use them in the Urb. As a result, all the mind probes throughout the Urb are deactivated, causing rioting and anarchy outside Eden. Bean is deposited at her home, and Ryter and Spaz are returned to their latch.

Back at Spaz&#x27;s home latch, Ryter is blamed for the deactivation of the mind probes and is killed by jetbikes. This triggers an epileptic seizure for Spaz. Before his death, Ryter tells Spaz that he is the last book in the universe. Billy Bizmo reveals to Spaz that he is his biological father and that his mother died at Spaz&#x27;s birth.

The story ends with Lanaya sending Spaz a message about things getting better in Eden and how she believes they can fix everything in time. Spaz takes on the name Ryter, continuing the original Ryter&#x27;s work, writing The Last Book in the Universe.

== Reception ==
&quot;The Last Book in the Universe&quot; has received mixed reviews. Many critics praised the novel for its involving plot. Debbie Carton, a reviewer from &quot;Booklist&quot;, called it a &quot;fast-paced adventure&quot; with a &quot;moving conclusion&quot; and &quot;memorable characters.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;[the book&#x27;s] futuristic dialect combined with striking descriptions of a postmodern civilization will convincingly transport readers to Spaz&#x27;s world.&quot;

However, Susan L. Rogers from &quot;School Library Journal&quot; pointed out that there are too many distractions that pull the reader&#x27;s attention away from the main theme. She also noted that the science in this science fiction novel was &quot;vague.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; added that the story was &quot;not fully developed,&quot; complaining that some scenes, such as the ones involving the Monkey Boys and the Furies, were &quot;a bit abrupt.&quot;

<doc id="613380" wikidata="Q671902" url="?curid=613380" title="Little Kanawha River">
<text>The Little Kanawha River is a tributary of the Ohio River, 169 mi (269 km) long, in western West Virginia in the United States. Via the Ohio, it is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of 2,320 mi2 (6,009 km2) on the unglaciated portion of the Allegheny Plateau. It served as an important commercial water route in the early history of West Virginia, particularly in the logging and petroleum industries.

==Course==
The Little Kanawha rises in southern Upshur County, approximately 20 mi (32 km) south of Buckhannon. It follows a meandering course generally west-northwestwardly, through Lewis, Braxton, Gilmer, Calhoun, Wirt and Wood Counties, past the communities of Burnsville, Stouts Mills, Sand Fork, Glenville, Grantsville, Bigbend, Creston, Burning Springs, Palestine, Elizabeth, and Newark, to its mouth at the Ohio River in Parkersburg.

About 3 mi (5 km) upstream of Burnsville, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam causes the river to form Burnsville Lake, which was completed in 1976 at a cost of $56.2 million.

==Tributaries==
Along its course the Little Kanawha River collects the Right Fork Little Kanawha River on the boundary of Lewis and Braxton counties; Saltlick Creek, England Run and Oil Creek in Braxton County; Sand Fork, Cedar Creek and Leading Creek in Gilmer County; Steer Creek in Calhoun County; the West Fork Little Kanawha River, Spring Creek, Reedy Creek, and the Hughes River (its largest tributary) in Wirt County; and Walker Creek, Tygart Creek, Slate Creek and Worthington Creek in Wood County.

Additionally, a minor tributary near Grantsville is known as the Bull River; despite being named a &quot;river,&quot; it is no larger than dozens of other small streams that flow into the Little Kanawha.

==Name==
The Little Kanawha River was named for its smaller size relative to the nearby Kanawha River.

According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Little Kanawha River has also been known as:

===Fishing===
Multiple West Virginia stage record fish were caught along the Little Kanawha River.

<doc id="613382" wikidata="Q24026" url="?curid=613382" title="Full Moon, Dirty Hearts">
<text>Full Moon, Dirty Hearts is the ninth studio album by Australian rock band INXS. It was released on 2 November 1993, through East West Records in Australia, in the United Kingdom by Phonogram&#x27;s Mercury Records label, and by Atlantic Records in the United States. The album drew mixed reviews, and sold less than previous works. The straight-ahead rock sound of the album was compared to the Rolling Stones by several reviewers, especially with reference to their 1972 album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot;, seen as a return to basics. &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; was followed by the Dirty Honeymoon world tour of 1993–1994.

&quot;Please (You Got That ...)&quot; featured vocals by Ray Charles and was released as a single. The title track featured vocals by the Pretenders lead singer, Chrissie Hynde.

The band&#x27;s manager, Chris Murphy, arranged to shoot videos for every song on the album. Twelve videos were shot on a small budget by twelve up-and-coming Australian directors.

The Japanese edition of the album included a cover of Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot;, which was specially recorded for the April 1993 launch of Virgin Radio in the UK.

==Background==
As INXS were finishing their previous studio album &quot;Welcome to Wherever You Are&quot;, they decided not to tour; instead the group recorded a follow-up album, then toured for both albums.

Following the release of &quot;Welcome to Wherever You Are&quot;, the band spent the next few months promoting the album across various countries in Europe, including the UK, France and Sweden. While promoting the album in Europe, vocalist Michael Hutchence visited then-girlfriend Helena Christensen in her home city of Copenhagen in Denmark. The couple were returning home on their bikes one night when Hutchence, who was standing in an alley with his bike, was punched from behind by a taxi driver and fell to the ground, hitting his head on the curb. He sustained a fractured skull and suffered the loss of his senses of smell and taste, and spent two weeks recovering in a Copenhagen hospital. In the unofficial biography &quot;Michael Hutchence: A Tragic Rock &amp; Roll Story&quot;, Australian author Vince Lovegrove wrote, &quot;It had a very strange effect on Michael. The alleged injury also caused the singer to act erratically, abusively and to suffer insomnia&quot;. These conditions had an impact on the production of &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot;.

==Recording and production==
The album was written soon after the release and promotion of the band&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Welcome to Wherever You Are&quot;, at the end of November 1992. The album was recorded and produced at Capri Studio on the Isle of Capri in Italy, and completed in February 1993. The Capri Studio had just re-opened during the recording of &quot;Welcome to Wherever You Are&quot; and after spotting an ad for it in a trade magazine, Hutchence and producer Mark Opitz insisted that the band should record their next record there. Rehearsals for &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; took place at Hutchence&#x27;s villa in the south of France in October 1992 where the group were often distracted by other celebrities and supermodels who Hutchence regularly invited. The group decided to set off to the Isle of Capri early, arriving on the island one month after rehearsals. The journey was long and tiring for all members of the band as it took them almost two days of travelling to get there. Once on the island, each member of the band received their own villa, with the studio itself located close by; the studio sat atop a steep cliff, overlooking the Bay of Naples. Guitarist and saxophonist Kirk Pengilly recalls, &quot;It was like a five-star Alcatraz&quot;. Hutchence and Opitz shared a villa on the island with Hutchence living upstairs and Opitz living downstairs.
Hutchence&#x27;s condition raised concerns throughout the recording process. At first he became distraught about being isolated on the island. On the first night, Opitz was awakened at four a.m. to the sound of furniture being smashed upstairs by Hutchence. During one session, Hutchence threatened to stab bassist Gary Beers with a knife after the two had a dispute. Songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Andrew Farriss recalls another incident where Hutchence shoved his microphone straight through the strings of an acoustic guitar while shouting, &quot;We need more aggression on this track!&quot; In the band&#x27;s 2005 official autobiography – &quot;INXS: Story to Story&quot;, Pengilly recalls, &quot;Michael had very violent moments. He threw his microphone stand around inside the studio, and he threw violent tantrums all the time&quot;. The group took a one-month break for the Christmas period, allowing Hutchence time to recover from his condition and the rest of the band time to spend with their families. Before breaking for the Christmas holidays, the band got half of the album completed. Hutchence returned to his estate in France, later joining Farriss in London to write the last remaining songs for the album.

At the start of the New Year, Hutchence and Farriss returned to the Isle of Capri one week earlier along with Opitz and engineer Niven Garland. Upon returning to the sessions in Capri, Hutchence&#x27;s behaviour had progressively returned to normal. While riding the hour and a half journey on the ferry from Naples to Capri, Hutchence began writing the lyrics for the album&#x27;s title track. Chrissie Hynde from The Pretenders would perform the song along with Hutchence. As the remaining members of INXS were preparing to return to the island, Hutchence, Farriss, Opitz and Garland managed to get six more tracks for the album finished including, &quot;Days of Rust&quot;, &quot;Please (You Got That...)&quot;, &quot;Freedom Deep&quot;, &quot;Kill the Pain&quot;, &quot;Viking Juice&quot; and the title track. Production of the album came to an end in late February 1993 with everyone spending the final night capturing ideas and doing last minute touch ups on some of the tracks. The following morning, INXS caught the morning ferry back to Naples to prepare for their journey to Paris to carry out additional work on the album. Opitz took the recording tapes to Los Angeles where he mixed them with mixing engineer Bob Clearmountain. Clearmountain previously engineered and mixed the band&#x27;s best selling album, &quot;Kick&quot;.

While recording overdubs at a studio in Paris, Hutchence and Farriss discovered that Ray Charles was recording at the same studio. The pair asked his engineer if Charles would be interested in recording vocals on two tracks for the album, &quot;Make Your Peace&quot; and &quot;Please (You Got That...)&quot;. Charles passed on &quot;Make Your Peace&quot; because he thought the key was too high for his voice but he agreed to perform vocals on &quot;Please (You Got That...)&quot;. The duet between Hutchence and Charles took place at Charles’ own recording studio in Los Angeles. Charles agreed to appear in the song&#x27;s music video and would also perform the song live with INXS (a few days before the album&#x27;s release) on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. The mixing of the album was completed by Opitz in July back on Capri while the band were touring some of the new songs on their Get Out of the House tour throughout the spring and summer.

==Reception==
&quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; received mixed reviews on its release. In his review for the 2002 book &quot;All Music Guide to Rock&quot;, Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album one star out of five and said, &quot;&quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; sounds tired and as calculated as &quot;X&quot;.&quot; He concluded his review by stating, &quot;INXS sounds energetic throughout the album, but the experimentation is poorly executed and there is a serious lack of strong songs and singles, apart from two duets: &#x27;Please (You Got That ...)&#x27; with Ray Charles and the title track, which features Chrissie Hynde.&quot; Erlewine&#x27;s one-star review was ported from the book to the AllMusic website in 2002, but after March 2024 the website changed the rating to two stars.

Christian Wright rated the album three stars in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Although he criticised INXS for sounding like other artists on some of the album&#x27;s songs, he did praise the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Time&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Thankfully, on &#x27;Time&#x27;, with its guitar and vocal counterpoint, the band sounds like itself, and Hutchence resumes the instinctive swagger that made him a video star.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; gave the album four out of five stars, and described the rock-heavy style as the band taking &quot;a step back&quot; from their &quot;flirtations with funk and pop sensibilities&quot;.

Writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Tony Parsons opined that this was the band&#x27;s &quot;most exciting album for years&quot;, comparing it to the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; as both albums represent &quot;the sound of a band getting back to the greasy basics.&quot; Parsons concludes that &quot;&quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; is INXS at their stomping best.&quot; Music critic J.D. Considine of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; said in his review. &quot;There&#x27;s plenty of edge to the material here, from the dense, dark throb of &#x27;The Gift&#x27; to the grungy, Stones-like snarl of &#x27;The Messenger, &#x27; but that hardly takes away from the music&#x27;s melodic appeal.&quot; Considine continued, &quot;it&#x27;s the bands freshest sounding effort in ages.&quot;

Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote in his review that, &quot;like the Stones at their peak, INXS takes bits of what&#x27;s hot – grunge, techno, hip-hop – and makes it their own. The loose mix of dirty guitars and warped ambiance, plus winning cameos by Ray Charles and Chrissie Hynde, makes &quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; the equal of anything INXS has ever released.&quot; &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; Chuck Arnold compared INXS to the Rolling Stones, writing that on &quot;lively, live-sounding cuts like &#x27;Days of Rust,&#x27; &#x27;The Gift&#x27; and &#x27;The Messenger,&#x27; they tear it up like a rough-and-rowdy bar band getting paid with all the beer they can drink.&quot; Arnold said that the album shows &quot;that Hutchence still has, unequivocally, one of the best voices in modern rock.&quot; 

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Full Moon, Dirty Hearts&quot; entered the Billboard Top 200 in November 1993. It peaked at number 53 and lasted only five weeks in the charts. The album did perform better outside the States having charted at number 3 in the United Kingdom and number 4 in Australia, earning Gold certifications in both countries.

<doc id="613389" wikidata="Q811663" url="?curid=613389" title="Cottonseed oil">
<text>Cottonseed oil is cooking oil from the seeds of cotton plants of various species, mainly &quot;Gossypium hirsutum&quot; and &quot;Gossypium herbaceum&quot;, that are grown for cotton fiber, animal feed, and oil.

Cotton seed has a similar structure to other oilseeds, such as sunflower seed, having an oil-bearing kernel surrounded by a hard outer hull; in processing, the oil is extracted from the kernel. Cottonseed oil is used for salad oil, mayonnaise, salad dressing, and similar products because of its flavor stability.

==Composition==

Its fatty acid profile generally consists of 70% unsaturated fatty acids (18% monounsaturated, and 52% polyunsaturated), 26% saturated fatty acids. When it is fully hydrogenated, its profile is 94% saturated fat and 2% unsaturated fatty acids (1.5% monounsaturated, and 0.5% polyunsaturated). According to the National Cottonseed Products Association, cottonseed oil does not need to be hydrogenated as much as other polyunsaturated oils to achieve similar results.

===Undesireable components in raw extract===
Gossypol is a toxic, yellow, polyphenolic compound produced by cotton and other members of the order Malvaceae, such as okra. This naturally occurring colored compound is found in tiny glands in the seed, leaf, stem, tap root bark, and root of the cotton plant. The adaptive function of the compound facilitates natural insect resistance. Raw extracts that have not undergone post processing, such as hydrogenation, will also contain the undesirable component cyclopropene fatty acid, but purportedly are &quot;mostly&quot; removed during refining, particularly deodorization and also hydrogenation. As such, processed/food-grade cottonseed oils are not considered to present a health hazard from cyclopropene fatty acids.
The three key steps of refining, bleaching, and deodorization in producing finished oil act to eliminate the gossypol level. Ferric chloride is often used to decolorize cotton seed oil.

===Comparison to other vegetable oils===
==Physical properties==
Once processed, cottonseed oil has a mild taste and appears generally clear with a light golden color, the amount of color depending on the amount of refining. It has a relatively high smoke point as a frying medium. Density ranges from . Like other long-chain fatty acid oils, cottonseed oil has a smoke point of about , and is high in tocopherols, which also contribute its stability, giving products that contain it a long shelf life, hence manufacturers&#x27; proclivity to use it in packaged goods.

== Production ==

In 2019, world production of cottonseed oil was 4.45 million tonnes, led by China and India with 56% combined of the total.

==Economic history==
The by-product of cotton processing, cottonseed was considered virtually worthless before the late 19th century. While cotton production expanded throughout the 17th, 18th, and mid-19th centuries, a largely worthless stock of cottonseed grew. Although some of the seed was used for planting, fertilizer, and animal feed, the majority was left to rot or was illegally dumped into rivers.

In the 1820s and 1830s Europe experienced fats and oils shortages due to rapid population expansion during the Industrial Revolution and the after-effects of the British blockade during the Napoleonic Wars. The increased demand for fats and oils, coupled with a decreasing supply caused prices to rise sharply. Consequently, many Europeans could not afford to buy the fats and oils they had used for cooking and for lighting. Many American entrepreneurs tried to take advantage of the increasing European demand for oils and America&#x27;s increasingly large supply of cottonseed by crushing the seed for oil. But separating the seed hull from the seed meat proved difficult and most of these ventures failed within a few years. This problem was resolved in 1857, when William Fee patented a huller, which effectively separated the tough hulls from the meats of cottonseed. With this new invention, cottonseed oil began to be used for illumination purposes in lamps to supplement increasingly expensive whale oil and lard. But by 1859, this use came to end as the petroleum industry emerged and the American Civil War (and the resulting end of slavery in the United States) disrupted the cotton industry.

Cottonseed oil then began to be used illegally to fortify animal fats and lards. Initially, meat packers secretly added cottonseed oil to the pure fats, but this practice was uncovered in 1884. Armour and Company, an American meatpacking and food processing company, sought to corner the lard market and realized that it had purchased more lard than the existing hog population could have produced. A congressional investigation followed, and legislation was passed that required products fortified with cottonseed oil to be labeled as &quot;lard compound&quot;.&quot; Similarly, cottonseed oil was often blended with olive oil. Once the practice was exposed, many countries put import tariffs on American olive oil and Italy banned the product completely in 1883. Both of these regulatory schemes depressed cottonseed oil sales and exports, once again creating an oversupply of cottonseed oil, which decreased its value.
It was cottonseed&#x27;s depressed value that led a newly formed Procter &amp; Gamble to utilize its oil. The Panic of 1837 caused the two brothers-in-law to merge their candlestick and soap manufacturing businesses in an effort to minimize costs and weather the bear market. Looking for a replacement for expensive animal fats in production, the brothers finally settled on cottonseed oil. Procter &amp; Gamble cornered the cottonseed oil market to circumvent the meat packer&#x27;s monopoly on the price. But as electricity emerged, the demand for candles decreased. Procter and Gamble then found an edible use for cottonseed oil. Through patented technology, the brothers were able to hydrogenate cottonseed oil and develop a substance that closely resembled lard. In 1911, Procter &amp; Gamble launched an aggressive marketing campaign to publicize its new product, Crisco, a vegetable shortening that could be used in place of lard. Crisco placed ads in major newspapers advertising that the product was &quot;easier on digestion ... a healthier alternative to cooking with animal fats ... and more economical than butter.&quot; The company also gave away free cookbooks, with every recipe calling for Crisco. By the 1920s the company developed cookbooks for specific ethnicities in their native tongues. Additionally, Crisco started airing radio cooking programs. Similarly, in 1899 David Wesson, a food chemist, developed deodorized cottonseed oil, Wesson cooking oil. Wesson Oil also was marketed heavily and became quite popular too.

Over the next 30 years cottonseed oil became the predominant cooking oil in the United States. Crisco and Wesson oil became direct substitutes for lard and other more expensive oils in baking, frying, sautéing, and salad dressings. By World War Two, cottonseed oil shortages forced the utilization of another direct substitute, soybean oil. By 1944, soybean oil production exceeded cottonseed oil production due to cottonseed shortages and soybean oil costs falling below that of cottonseed oil. By 1950, soybean oil replaced cottonseed oil in the use of shortenings like Crisco due to soybeans&#x27; comparatively low price. Prices for cottonseed were also increased by the replacement of cotton acreage by corn and soybeans, a trend fueled in large part by the boom in demand for corn syrup and ethanol. Cottonseed oil and production continued to decline throughout the mid- and late 20th century.

In the mid- to late 2000s, the consumer trend of avoiding trans fats, and mandatory labeling of trans fats in some jurisdictions, sparked an increase in the consumption of cottonseed oil, with some health experts and public health agencies recommending it as a healthy oil. Crisco and other producers have been able to reformulate cottonseed oil so it contains little to no trans fats. Still, some health experts claim that cottonseed oil&#x27;s high ratio of polyunsaturated fats to monounsaturated fats and processed nature make it unhealthy.

Cottonseed oil in Canada must be pressed from the seed of the &quot;Gossypium&quot; plant. As a single-source vegetable oil, 100% cottonseed oil must appear as &quot;cottonseed oil&quot; on the labels of any products sold.

Cottonseed oil sold as an edible product must be processed and refined to eliminate specific components that could present as a food safety hazard, in particular gossypol, which can act as a toxin to humans, and can lead to infertility in men.

== Extraction ==
Cottonseed oil, like other vegetable oils, is extracted from the seed of the plant, through either mechanical processes such as crushing or pressing, or by chemical processes such as solvent extraction. Cottonseed oil is most commonly extracted commercially via solvent extraction.

==Use in food==
Cottonseed oil has traditionally been used in foods such as potato chips and was for many years a primary ingredient in Crisco, the shortening product. The current formulation of Crisco is primarily made from soybean oil and palm oil. Significantly less expensive than olive oil or canola oil, cottonseed oil was a popular frying oil for the restaurant and snack-food manufacturing industries.

Cottonseed oil was used in the production of edible food products, such as cooking oils, salad oils, margarines and shortenings. In the United States, cottonseed oil was used in Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Olestra and Olein products as a type of non-digestible fat substitutes used to create creamy textures and rich flavors in fried foods.

The FDA released its final determination that Partially Hydrogenated Oils (PHOs), which include partially hydrogenated cottonseed oil, are not Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) in 2015. However, to allow for time for reformulation, the agency extended the compliance date to stop manufacturing foods with these specific, limited petitioned uses of PHOs until June 18, 2019. The final compliance date to allow manufacturers time to reformulate foods and ensure an orderly transition in the marketplace was established as January 1, 2021. Then, on December 22, 2023, the FDA completed final administrative actions on the revocation of uses of PHOs in food. So, it can be said that the GRAS status of cottonseed oil, specifically in its partially hydrogenated form, was effectively lost by January 1, 2021.

== Nonfood uses ==
For agricultural applications, cottonseed oil generally has the greatest insecticide power among all the vegetable oils. It is traditionally used because of its effectiveness in hard to treat pest problems in fruit trees. Cottonseed oil can also be mixed with other insecticides to provide a broader spectrum and increased control on pests. Spider mites, whiteflies and young stages of scales are common pests that can be controlled using cottonseed oil.

In an agricultural context, the toxicity of untreated cottonseed oil may be considered beneficial: Oils, including vegetable oils, have been used for centuries to control insect and mite pests. More recently, cottonseed oil has been used to protect the trunks of apple trees from the apple clearwing moth, which burrows into the trees&#x27; bark, potentially killing them. This oil has been generally considered the most insecticidal of vegetable oils.

<text>Edmund Kealoha Parker (March 19, 1931 – December 15, 1990) was an American martial artist, who founded and codified the art of American Kenpo.

==Life==
Born in Honolulu, Parker began training in Judo at an early age and later studied boxing. During the 1940s, Parker was introduced to Kenpō by Frank Chow, who then introduced Parker to William Chow, a student of James Mitose. Parker trained with William Chow while serving in the Coast Guard and attending Brigham Young University, and in 1953 he was promoted to the rank of black belt. Parker, seeing that modern times posed new situations that were not addressed in Kenpo, adapted the art to make it more easily applicable to the streets of America. He called his adapted style American Kenpo Karate.

===Success and students===
Parker opened the first karate school in the western United States in Provo, Utah, in 1954. By 1956, he opened a dojo in Pasadena, California. There is controversy over whether the first black belt that Parker awarded went to Rich Montgomery or to his first brown-belt student, Charles Beeder. Beeder&#x27;s son has stated for the record that his father&#x27;s black belt came after Ed Parker had moved to California. The other black belts in chronological order up to 1962 were James Ibrao, Ben Otaké; Mills Crenshaw, whom Parker authorized to open a school in Salt Lake City, Utah, in late 1958 (which later became the birthplace of the International Kenpo Karate Association, or IKKA); Tom Garriga; Rick Flores; Chuck Sullivan; Al and Jim Tracy; Mark Georgantas; John McSweeney; and Dave Hebler. In 1962, John McSweeney opened a school in Ireland, which prompted Parker to give control of the Kenpo Karate Association of America to the Tracy Brothers and form a new organization: the International Kenpo Karate Association.

Parker was well known for his business creativity and helped many martial artists open their own dojos. He was well known in Hollywood, where he trained several stunt men and celebrities, most notably Elvis Presley, to whom he eventually awarded a first-degree black belt in Kenpo. He left behind a few world-renowned grand masters: Bob White; Richard &quot;Huk&quot; Planas; Larry Tatum; Ron Chapel; and Frank Trejo, who ran a school in California prior to his death. He helped Bruce Lee gain national attention by introducing him at his International Karate Championships. He served as one of Elvis Presley&#x27;s bodyguards during the singer&#x27;s final years. He is best known to Kenpoists as the founder of American Kenpo and is referred to fondly as the &quot;Father of American Kenpo.&quot; He is formally referred to as Senior Grand Master of American Kenpo.

===Hollywood career===
Parker had a minor career as a Hollywood actor and stunt man. His most notable film was &quot;Kill the Golden Goose&quot;. In this film, he co-stars with Hapkido master Bong Soo Han. He also played himself (as a mercenary) in the 1979 action film &quot;Seven&quot;, opposite William Smith. His other acting work included the (uncredited) role of Mr. Chong in Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot; and again in &quot;Curse of the Pink Panther&quot;. He was one of the instructors of martial arts action-movie star Jeff Speakman, and Parker assisted with the fight choreography of Speakman&#x27;s film &quot;The Perfect Weapon&quot;, which was released in 1991, shortly after Parker&#x27;s death.

Parker can be seen with Elvis Presley in the opening sequence of the 1977 TV special &quot;Elvis in Concert&quot;. Parker wrote a book about his time with Elvis on the road.

==Parker&#x27;s training==
Ed Parker was enrolled in Judo classes by his father at the age of twelve, and Parker received his Shodan in Judo in 1949 at the age of eighteen. After receiving his brown belt in Kenpo, he moved to the US mainland to attend Brigham Young University, where he began to teach martial arts. Mr. Parker&#x27;s kenpo shodan diploma is dated 1953.

During this period, Parker was significantly influenced by the Japanese and Okinawan interpretations prevalent in Hawaii. Parker&#x27;s book &quot;Kenpo Karate&quot;, published in 1961, shows the many hard linear movements, albeit with modifications, that set his interpretations apart.

All the influences up to that time were reflected in Parker&#x27;s rigid, linear method of &quot;Kenpo Karate,&quot; as it was called. Between writing and publishing, however, he began to be influenced by the Chinese arts, and included this information in his system. He settled in Southern California after leaving the Coast Guard and finishing his education at BYU. Here he found himself surrounded by other martial artists from a wide variety of systems, many of whom were willing to discuss and share their arts with him. Parker made contact with people like Ark Wong, Haumea Lefiti, Jimmy Wing Woo (who developed many of the American Kenpo forms still used today), Jimmy H.Woo (Chin Siu Dek), founder and Grandmaster of San Soo and Lau Bun. These martial artists were known for their skills in arts such as Five Family Fist Kung Fu, Splashing-Hands, San Soo, tai chi, and Hung Gar, and this influence remains visible in both historical material (such as forms that Parker taught in his system) and current principles.

Exposed to new Chinese training concepts and history, he wrote a second book, &quot;Secrets of Chinese Karate,&quot; published in 1963. Parker drew comparisons in this and other books between karate (a better known art in the United States at that time) and the Chinese methods he adopted and taught.

==Death==
On December 15, 1990, Parker, aged 59, suffered a heart attack after arriving at Honolulu International Airport. He died en route to Kaiser Hospital.

<text>The greater crested tern (Thalasseus bergii), also called crested tern, swift tern, or great crested tern, is a tern in the family Laridae that nests in dense colonies on coastlines and islands in the tropical and subtropical Old World. Its four or five subspecies breed in the area from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the central Pacific and Australia, all populations dispersing widely from the breeding range after nesting. This large tern is closely related to other species in its genus, but can be distinguished by its darker, battleship-grey upperparts, white forehead even in full breeding plumage, and greenish-tinged yellow (not orange or black) bill colour.

The greater crested tern has dark grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow bill, and a shaggy black crest that recedes in winter. Its young have a distinctive appearance, with strongly patterned grey, brown and white plumage, and rely on their parents for food for several months after they have fledged. Like all members of the genus &quot;Thalasseus&quot;, the greater crested tern feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments; the male offers fish to the female as part of the courtship ritual.

This is an adaptable species that has learned to follow fishing boats for jettisoned bycatch, and to use unusual nest sites such as the roofs of buildings and artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works. Its eggs and young are taken by gulls and ibises, and human activities such as fishing, shooting and egg harvesting have caused local population declines. There are no global conservation concerns for this bird, which has a stable total population of more than 500,000 individuals.

== Taxonomy ==
The terns, subfamily Sterninae, are small to medium-sized seabirds closely related to the gulls, skimmers and skuas. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings (which give them a fast, buoyant flight), a deeply forked tail and short legs. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap that is reduced or flecked with white in the winter.

The greater crested tern was originally described as &quot;Sterna bergii&quot; by German naturalist Martin Lichtenstein in 1823, but was moved to its current genus &quot;Thalasseus&quot;, after mitochondrial DNA studies confirmed that the three main head patterns shown by terns (no black cap, black cap, black cap with a white forehead) corresponded to distinct clades.

The closest relative of greater crested tern is the critically endangered species Chinese crested tern (&quot;T. bernsteini&quot;), with the next closest being a group of three orange-billed species, West African crested tern &quot;T. albididorsalis&quot;, lesser crested tern (&quot;T. bengalensis&quot;), and royal tern (&quot;T. maximus&quot;). Earlier studies of the genus &quot;Thalasseus&quot; had not included &quot;T. bernsteini&quot;, as genetic material was not then available, but otherwise had broadly similar results.

The generic name of the greater crested tern is derived from Greek &quot;Thalassa&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;, and the species epithet &quot;bergii&quot; commemorates Karl Heinrich Bergius, a Prussian pharmacist and botanist who collected the first specimens of this tern near Cape Town.

The greater crested tern has four or five geographical subspecies (depending on authority), differing mainly in the darkness of the upperparts and the bill dimensions. These are listed below in taxonomic sequence. A similar number of other potential subspecies have been proposed, but are not considered valid.

== Description ==

The greater crested tern is a large tern with a long () yellow bill, black legs, and a glossy black crest that is noticeably shaggy at its rear. The breeding adult of the nominate subspecies &quot;T. b. bergii&quot; is long, with a wing-span; weight . The forehead and the underparts are white, the back and inner wings are dusky-grey. In winter, the upperparts plumage wears to a paler grey, and the crown of the head becomes white, merging at the rear into a peppered black crest and mask.

The adults of both sexes are identical in appearance, but juvenile birds are distinctive, with a head pattern like the winter adult, and upperparts strongly patterned in grey, brown, and white; the closed wings appear to have dark bars. After moulting, the young terns resemble the adult, but still have a variegated wing pattern with a dark bar on the inner flight feathers.

The northern subspecies &quot;T. b. velox&quot; and &quot;T. b. thalassinus&quot; are in breeding plumage from May to September or October, whereas the relevant period for the two southern African subspecies is from December to April. For &quot;T. b. cristatus&quot;, the moult timing depends on location; birds from Australia and Oceania are in breeding plumage from September to about April, but those in Thailand, China and Sulawesi have this appearance from February to June or July.

The royal tern is similar in size to this species, but has a heavier build, broader wings, a paler back and a blunter, more orange bill. The greater crested often associates with the lesser crested tern, but is 25% larger than the latter, with a proportionately longer bill, longer and heavier head, and bulkier body. Lesser crested tern has an orange-tinted bill, and in immature plumage it is much less variegated than greater crested.

The greater crested tern is highly vocal, especially at its breeding grounds. The territorial advertising call is a loud, raucous, crow-like &#x27;. Other calls include a &#x27; given at the nest by anxious or excited birds, and a hard &quot;&quot; in flight.

== Distribution and habitat ==

The greater crested tern occurs in tropical and warm temperate coastal parts of the Old World from South Africa around the Indian Ocean to the Pacific and Australia. 

The subspecies &quot;T. b. bergii&quot; (including the doubtfully distinct &quot;T. b. enigma&quot;) breeds in southern Africa from Namibia to Tanzania, and possibly on islands around Madagascar. There is then a break in the breeding distribution of the species until &quot;T. b. velox&quot; is met in Somalia, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf, and another discontinuity further east in southern India.

The subspecies &quot;T. b. thalassinus&quot; breeds on many islands in the Indian Ocean including Aldabra and Etoile in the Seychelles, the Chagos Archipelago, and Rodrigues. 

In the Pacific Ocean, there are colonies of &quot;T. b. cristatus&quot; on numerous Pacific islands, including Kiribati, Fiji, Tonga, the Society Islands and the Tuamotus, as well as more widely on islets off the coasts of China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, and Australia south to Tasmania.

The nests are located on low‑lying sandy, rocky, or coral islands, sometimes amongst stunted shrubs, often without any shelter at all. When not breeding, the greater crested tern will roost or rest on open shores, less often on boats, pilings, harbour buildings and raised salt mounds in lagoons. It is rarely seen on tidal creeks or inland waters.

All populations of greater crested tern disperse after breeding. When Southern African birds leave colonies in Namibia and Western Cape Province, most adults move east to the Indian Ocean coastline of South Africa. Many young birds also travel east, sometimes more than , but others move northwards along the western coast. &quot;T. b. thalassinus&quot; winters on the east African coast north to Kenya and Somalia and may move as far south as Durban. Populations of &quot;T. b. velox&quot; breeding from the Persian Gulf eastwards appear to be sedentary or dispersive rather than truly migratory, but those breeding in the Red Sea winter south along the east African coast to Kenya. &quot;T. b. cristatus&quot; mostly stays within of its colonies, but some birds wander up to around . This species has occurred as a vagrant to Hawaii, New Zealand, North Korea, Jordan, and Israel.
In India, the greater crested tern is protected in the PM Sayeed Marine Birds Conservation Reserve.

== Behaviour ==

=== Breeding ===
The greater crested tern breeds in colonies, often in association with other seabirds. It is monogamous and the pair bond is maintained through the year and sometimes in consecutive breeding seasons. The colony size is related to the abundance of pelagic fish prey, and the largest documented colony, with 13,000 to 15,000 pairs, is in the Gulf of Carpentaria in northern Australia, a region which also supports major colonies of other seabirds. Since nesting in this area follows the summer monsoonal flooding, it is presumably a response to fish stocks rising, probably due to river run-off providing extra nutrient to the Gulf. This tern does not show site fidelity, frequently changing its nest site from year to year, sometimes by more than .

A male greater crested tern establishes a small area of the colony in preparation for nesting, and initially pecks at any other tern entering his territory. If the intruder is another male, it retaliates in kind, and is normally vigorously repelled by the incumbent. A female entering the nest area reacts passively to the male&#x27;s aggression, enabling him to recognise her sex and initiate pair formation by display, including head raising and bowing; this behaviour is frequently repeated during nesting to reinforce the bond between the pair. Terns also use fish as part of the courtship ritual. One bird flies around the colony with a fish in its beak, calling loudly; its partner may also fly, but the pair eventually settle and the gift is exchanged.

The nest is a shallow scrape in the sand on open, flat or occasionally sloping ground. It is often unlined, but sometimes includes stones or cuttlefish bones. One, sometimes two, eggs are laid and incubated by both parents for 25 to 30 days prior to hatching. The eggs are cream with blackish streaks. Egg laying is synchronised within a breeding colony and more tightly so within sub-colonies. Parents do not recognize their own eggs or newly hatched chicks, but are able to distinguish their chicks by the time they are two days-old, shortly before they begin to wander from the nest. The precocial chicks, which are very pale with black speckling, are brooded and fed by both parents, but may gather in crèches when older. The young terns fledge after 38 to 40 days, but remain dependent on the parents after leaving the colony until they are about four months old.


In South Africa, this species has adapted to breeding on the roofs of building, sometimes with Hartlaub&#x27;s gull, which also shares the more typical nesting sites of the nominate subspecies. In 2000, 7.5% of the population of this subspecies bred on roofs. Artificial islands in salt pans and sewage works have also recently been colonised by this adaptable seabird.

Adult terns have few predators, but in Namibia immature birds are often robbed of their food by kelp gulls, and that species, along with Hartlaub&#x27;s gull, silver gull and sacred ibis, has been observed feeding on eggs or nestlings, especially when colonies are disturbed. Smaller subcolonies with a relatively larger numbers of nests located on the perimeter are subject to more predation. In Australia, predation by cats and dogs, and occasional deaths by shooting or collisions with cars, wires or light-towers have been documented.

Commercial fisheries can have both positive and negative effects on the greater crested tern. Juvenile survival rates are improved where trawler discards provide extra food, and huge population increases in the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria are thought to have been due to the development of a large prawn trawl fishery. Conversely, purse-seine fishing reduces the available food supply, and sizeable fluctuations in the numbers of great crested terns breeding in the Western Cape of South Africa are significantly related to changes in the abundance of pelagic fish, which are intensively exploited by purse-seine fishing. Terns may be killed or injured by collisions with trawl warps, trapped in trawls or discarded gear, or hooked by longline fishing, but, unlike albatrosses and petrels, there is little evidence that overall numbers are significantly affected.

An unusual incident was the incapacitation of 103 terns off Robben Island, South Africa by marine foam, generated by a combination of wave action, kelp mucilage and phytoplankton. After treatment, 90% of the birds were fit to be released.

=== Feeding ===
Fish are the main food of the greater crested tern, found to make up nearly 90% of all prey items with the remainder including cephalopods, crustaceans and insects. Unusual vertebrate prey included agamid lizards and green turtle hatchlings.

The greater crested tern feeds mostly at sea by plunge diving to a depth of up to , or by dipping from the surface, and food is usually swallowed in mid-air. Birds may forage up to from land in the breeding season. Prey size ranges from in length and up to in weight. Shoaling pelagic fish such as anchovy and sardine are typical prey, but bottom-living species are taken as discards from commercial fishing. This tern actively follows trawlers, including at night, and during the fishing season trawl discards can constitute 70% of its diet. Prawn fishing is particularly productive in providing extra food, since prawns usually represent only 10–20% of the catch, the remaining being bycatch, mainly fish such as cardinalfish and gobies.

A study of an area of the Great Barrier Reef where the number of breeding great crested terns has grown ten-fold, probably due to extra food from trawl by-catch, suggested that lesser crested and sooty terns have moved away and now breed on a part of the reef where fishing is banned. It is possible that the large increase in the number of greater crested terns may have affected other species through competition for food and nesting sites.

Terns have red oil droplets in the cone cells of the retinas of their eyes. This improves contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions. Birds that have to see through an air/water interface, such as terns and gulls, have more strongly coloured carotenoid pigments in the cone oil drops than other avian species. The improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or observing other terns diving for food. Tern&#x27;s eyes are not particularly ultraviolet sensitive, an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls.

== Status ==
The greater crested tern has a widespread distribution range, estimated at 1–10 million square kilometres (0.4–3.8 million square miles). The population has not been quantified, but it is not believed to approach the thresholds for either the size criterion (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals) or the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the IUCN Red List. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as being of Least Concern at the global level. However, there are concerns for populations in some areas such as the Gulf of Thailand where the species no longer breeds, and in Indonesia where egg harvesting has caused declines.

All subspecies except &quot;T. b. cristatus&quot; are covered under the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA). Parties to the Agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation.

<doc id="613402" wikidata="Q1933012" url="?curid=613402" title="Frizzle Fry">
<text>Frizzle Fry is the debut studio album by American rock band Primus. It was released on February 7, 1990, by Caroline Records. Produced by the band and Matt Winegar, the album was recorded at Different Fur Studios in San Francisco in December 1989. In 2015, Primus frontman Les Claypool ranked &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; as his favorite Primus album.

== Background ==
Primus self-financed the recording of &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; using proceeds from their preceding album, &quot;Suck On This&quot;. The completed album was then released in 1990 on Caroline Records. &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; features guitarist Larry LaLonde playing many parts written by previous guitarist Todd Huth who left before the recording of the album.

&quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; features the band&#x27;s first single and minor radio hit &quot;John the Fisherman&quot;. It was remastered in 2002, after the original had been out of print for years, and was released on Prawn Song Records. The remaster includes an extra track, named &quot;Hello Skinny/Constantinople&quot;, a cover of the tracks &quot;Hello Skinny&quot; and &quot;Constantinople&quot; by the Residents.

&quot;Too Many Puppies&quot; is the first Primus song Les Claypool ever wrote. &quot;You Can&#x27;t Kill Michael Malloy&quot; is an excerpt from the Spent Poets song of the same name. The album&#x27;s producer, Matt Winegar, who also recorded and produced &quot;Suck on This&quot;, was a member of the group, and a clip is featured just before &quot;The Toys Go Winding Down&quot;. The beginning of &quot;To Defy the Laws of Tradition&quot; is an excerpt from the instrumental &quot;YYZ&quot; by the Canadian rock band Rush from their 1981 album &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, sampled from the live version of &quot;John the Fisherman&quot; which appears on &quot;Suck on This&quot;. Another &quot;Suck on This&quot; sample also appears at the end of &quot;Groundhog&#x27;s Day&quot;; the &quot;Hey hey, Bob Cock here!&quot; spoken intro from that album&#x27;s version.

== Live performance ==
Primus supported &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; by opening for Jane&#x27;s Addiction on a North American tour.

The album was performed live in its entirety on the band&#x27;s Hallucino-Genetics Tour in 2004 and a few more times in 2010. During the Hallucino-Genetics Tour, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Kill Michael Malloy&quot; was featured in its entirety as a short set break, as opposed to merely the excerpt that appears on the album.

== Critical reception ==

Robert Christgau described the album as &quot;Don Knotts Jr. joins the Minutemen.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;echoes of San Francisco&#x27;s late and (in some quarters) lamented Dead Kennedys can be heard in this S.F. trio&#x27;s cartoonish vocals and blasts at adult hypocrisy (&#x27;To Defy the Laws of Tradition&#x27;) and mindless conformity (&#x27;Too Many Puppies&#x27;), but the sound is jazzy speed-metal, not punk.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; said that &quot;Primus exhibits the delinquent musical tendencies of early Frank Zappa updated to sit comfortably in the modern milieu of bands such as Anthrax and Faith No More&quot;.

&quot;Trouser Press&quot; stated that &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; &quot;effectively showcases drummer Tim &#x27;Herb&#x27; Alexander&#x27;s tight, frenetic technique and guitarist Larry LaLonde&#x27;s aggro-fusion chops.&quot; Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Ned Raggett noted that &quot;it&#x27;s pretty easy to see in retrospect how much of a melange went into the group&#x27;s work. Nods but thankfully few outright steals to everything from Frank Zappa&#x27;s arch humor and Funkadelic&#x27;s sprawl to the Police&#x27;s early, spare effectiveness crop up and, indeed, so does plenty of Metallica.&quot; He contended that &quot;something about &quot;Frizzle Fry&quot; is ultimately and perfectly of its time and place.&quot;

<doc id="613404" wikidata="Q7758826" url="?curid=613404" title="The Pursuit of Happiness (band)">
<text>The Pursuit of Happiness (TPOH) are a Canadian rock and power pop band best known for their song &quot;I&#x27;m an Adult Now&quot;.

==Beginnings==
Led by Edmonton, Alberta, frontman Moe Berg, The Pursuit of Happiness were launched in 1985 when he and drummer Dave Gilby moved to Toronto, Ontario. They soon met bassist Johnny Sinclair and formed the band, adding sisters Tamara and Natasha Amabile as backing vocalists. Their debut single, &quot;I&#x27;m an Adult Now&quot;, quickly became a smash hit across Canada in 1986, sparked by a low-budget video (made by Berg&#x27;s director friend Nelu Ghiran) which made it onto the Canadian music video channel MuchMusic.

The band signed with manager Jeff Rogers (Swell) in 1986. The band did not immediately sign to a record label, but instead released another independent single, &quot;Killed by Love&quot;, in 1988. The Amabile sisters left to concentrate on their own band, and were replaced by Kris Abbott (guitar and backing vocals) and Leslie Stanwyck (backing vocals) in early 1988.

==Chrysalis Records==
In 1988, they signed to Chrysalis Records. Their debut album, &quot;Love Junk&quot;, was produced by Todd Rundgren and released that year. &quot;I&#x27;m an Adult Now&quot; was re-recorded and re-released as a single, making it to the charts a second time. In January 1989 the song peaked at No. 6 on Billboard&#x27;s alternative songs chart. It was followed by &quot;She&#x27;s So Young&quot;, which became their biggest hit single in Canada and also received radio play in the UK and became a minor hit there, and &quot;Hard To Laugh&quot;. The album sold over 100,000 copies in Canada and was certified platinum.

The band&#x27;s follow-up album with Rundgren, 1990&#x27;s &quot;One Sided Story,&quot; featured the hit singles &quot;New Language&quot; and &quot;Two Girls in One.&quot; Although the album did not sell as well as &quot;Love Junk&quot; it was still a significant hit for the band. 

Stanwyck and Sinclair left the band in early 1990, going on to form power pop band Universal Honey. Starting with the Spring 1990 tour for &quot;One Sided Story,&quot; Brad Barker (bass) and Susan Murumets (backing vocals) joined the lineup. Murumets left the band in 1992 in order to pursue the business side of music, and was replaced by Rachel Oldfield.

==Mercury Records, then Iron Music==
The band then went through difficulties with Chrysalis, and eventually followed Chrysalis president Mike Bone to Mercury Records in 1992, and released &quot;The Downward Road&quot; in 1993. Despite some success with the single &quot;Cigarette Dangles&quot; (the video appeared on &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;), more label troubles ensued, and the band recorded their next two albums for the now-defunct Canadian label Iron Music. Oldfield left the band in 1995, and was replaced by Jennifer Foster, who in turn left the following year and was replaced by Renee Suchy.

==Canadian Indies Hall of Fame, reunion shows, recent Canadian tour dates==
Although the group never officially disbanded, after 1996 they did not record as a unit until 2005, when they recorded two new tracks for a greatest hits compilation. The most recent lineup has played a few concerts over the last decade, including in a series of shows over the last week of 2005 which ended with a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in London, Ontario. In March 2006, they were inducted into the Canadian Indies Hall of Fame.

The band reunited for the Q107 Jingle Ball on 13 December 2014, at the Phoenix Concert Theatre in Toronto, and at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto on 27 October 2017 as part of the Horseshoe&#x27;s 70th anniversary series of shows.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Love Junk&quot;″s release, in September 2018 the band released a deluxe edition, featuring remastered versions of &quot;Love Junk&quot;″s 13 tunes, and a 13 additional unreleased, live, and other rare recordings. To support the deluxe album&#x27;s release the band played several dates in Canada in late 2018 and in 2019, where they would play &quot;Love Junk&quot; in its entirety, along with several other favorites. As of 2024 the band continues to play selected festivals, events, and other dates.

<text>Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, (February 3, 1843September 11, 1915) was an American businessman, industrialist and railroad magnate who spent most of his career in Canada. He is famous for overseeing the construction of the first Canadian transcontinental railway, a project that was completed in 1885, in under half the projected time. He succeeded Lord Mount Stephen as president of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in 1888. Van Horne was responsible for launching the sea transport division of the CPR, which inaugurated regular service between Vancouver and Hong Kong in 1891. He also presided over the expansion of the CPR into the luxury hotel business in the 1890s. Van Horne was also a prominent member of the syndicate that created the Cuba Railroad Company in 1900. He lived at the Van Horne Mansion in Montreal&#x27;s Golden Square Mile.

==Ancestry and early life==
Born on February 3, 1843, in rural Illinois, Van Horne moved with his family to Joliet, Illinois, when he was eight years old.

Van Horne was the eldest child of Cornelius Covenhoven Van Horne (1794–1854) by his second wife Mary Minier Richards of Sandusky, Ohio. Cornelius studied law at Union College, but took his family out west to seek his fortune farming. Misfortune followed as his house, barns and law books were destroyed by fire, and his first wife died shortly afterwards. Abandoning farming, he returned to the law and became Recorder of Will County, Illinois, moving his family to Joliet, Illinois. Cornelius was active in getting the city its first charter, and because of this he was elected Joliet&#x27;s first mayor. When the city later built a new bridge it was named the Van Horne Bridge.

Van Horne&#x27;s grandfather, Abraham Van Horne, graduated from Queens College (now Rutgers) with avocation for the ministry, and received his license to preach in 1792 from the Reformed Church of America. Van Horne held three pastorates, one at Wawarsing, one near Kingston, New York and his last at Caughnawaga (now Fonda, New York), from 1796 to 1833.

==Career==

At the age of 14, Van Horne began working on railroads, serving in various capacities on the Illinois Central Railroad until 1864. He went on to work for the Chicago and Alton Railway, serving as general superintendent from 1878 to 1879. In 1882, Van Horne was appointed general manager of the Canadian Pacific Railway, becoming its vice-president in 1884 and president in 1888, finally becoming chairman of the board in 1899. He is most famous for overseeing the major construction of the first Canadian transcontinental railway, a project that, under his leadership, was completed in under half the projected time.
Van Horne considered the railway an integrated communications and transportation system and convinced the directors and shareholders to create a telegraph service and an express freight delivery service as a complement to the railway. Van Horne was knowledgeable in nearly every element of the railway industry, including operating a locomotive. A wealthy man, he later became an investor of the Cuba Railroad Company, which built the first trans-country railway connecting Havana with the two eastern provinces (Camaguey and Oriente) and the city of Santiago de Cuba in 1901.

From 1885 onward, Van Horne was more and more associated with every branch of Canadian mercantile and financial life, and as a publicist gave expression to his views on political and economic questions. Van Horne was responsible for launching the sea transport division of the Canadian Pacific Railway, inaugurating a regular service between Vancouver and Hong Kong in 1891 on the &quot;Empress&quot; luxury liners. He also presided over the expansion of the CPR into the luxury hotel business and participated in the design of two of the most famous ones in the chain, the Château Frontenac in Quebec City and Chateau Lake Louise in Alberta.

==Personal life==
Van Horne married Lucy Hurd in 1867, and they had three children. The elder son, William Cornelius Van Horne Jr., died at age four, while their daughter, Lucy Adeline &quot;Addie&quot; Van Horne, and younger son, Richard Benedict &quot;Benny&quot; Van Horne, lived to adulthood. Benny married Edith Molson, of the Montreal Molsons, and the couple had a son, named William for his grandfather.

Sir William purchased and enlarged a house in 1889 later known as the Van Horne Mansion in Montreal, Quebec. In 1891, he began building his summer estate, which Van Horne named &quot;Covenhoven&quot;, on Minister&#x27;s Island, adjacent to CPR&#x27;s resort town of St. Andrews, New Brunswick. The island estate is accessible by a natural sandbar road during the Bay of Fundy&#x27;s low tide.

Van Horne was a governor of McGill University from 1895 to 1915 and was one of the first in Canada to acquire artworks by members of the French impressionist movement. He was himself a painter, with Van Horne&#x27;s surviving works now residing in museums such as the Montreal Museum of Fine Art and Covenhoven itself. His other talents included sculpture, architecture, playing the violin, fossil collection, farming, botany and gardening.

Following Van Horne&#x27;s death at the Royal Victoria Hospital, in Montreal, Quebec in 1915 at age 72, his remains were interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Joliet, Illinois. His Montreal home in the Golden Square Mile was controversially demolished in 1973.

==Honours==
Van Horne was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in Queen Victoria&#x27;s 1894 Birthday Honours. As an American citizen, he was technically not entitled to the prefix &quot;Sir&quot;; nonetheless, Van Horne was thereafter addressed as &quot;Sir William&quot;.

The Van Horne Institute, based in Calgary, Alberta, is affiliated with the University of Calgary, Athabasca University and the University of Alberta and conducts research and policy studies related to all things carriage related, including rail, air, shipping and road transportation, pipelines, electricity and information networks.

Sir William Van Horne Elementary School in Vancouver, B.C., is named after Van Horne, in honour of his contributions to British Columbia. There are streets named for Van Horne in several Canadian cities including Montreal, Toronto, Sudbury, Winnipeg, Brandon, and Regina. In Cuba, a borough (near to the railways) of the city of Camaguey, a street in front of the Camaguey railways station, and a small town in the province of Holguín are named after Van Horne.

Van Horne&#x27;s summer estate on Minister&#x27;s Island was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1996.

In 1999, William Van Horne was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame in the category of &quot;National: Railway Workers &amp; Builders.&quot;

In 2011, Van Horne was featured in &quot;Rocky Mountain Express&quot;, a 45-minute IMAX film about the construction of the CPR.

The Canadian Pacific Railway maintains a private business car in their fleet named &quot;Van Horne&quot;.

<text>Paul Friedrich (15 September 1800 – 7 March 1842) ruled as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin from 1837 to 1842.

==Biography==
He was born in Ludwigslust the son of Friedrich Ludwig, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna of Russia, and was the only surviving grandchild of Paul I of Russia who was born during the Tsar&#x27;s lifetime. Paul Friedrich was educated at Geneva, Jena and Rostock. Paul Friedrich became heir-apparent to the throne of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1819, upon the death of his father, the Hereditary Grand Duke.

On 1 February 1837 he succeeded his grandfather, Friedrich Franz I. His reign saw improvements in the infrastructure and judicial system of the Grand Duchy, as well as a change in the government&#x27;s seat of residence from Ludwigslust to Schwerin. Nonetheless, Paul Friedrich was largely interested only in military matters and spent most of his time drilling his troops. As Paul Friedrich reached his middle age, he adopted a more reclusive lifestyle, preferring only the company of his mistress. Paul Friedrich died in 1842 of a cold caught while rushing to a fire in his capital city.

==Marriage and children==
Paul Friedrich married Princess Alexandrine of Prussia at Berlin on 25 May 1822. They had two sons and one daughter:
*Friedrich Franz II (1823–1883)
*Luise (1824–1859) married Hugo, Prince of Windisch-Grätz and had issue (Princess Marie of Windisch-Graetz)
*Wilhelm (1827–1879) married Princess Alexandrine of Prussia, daughter of Prince Albert of Prussia

Paul Friedrich also had issue with his mistress, Countess Catharina von Hauke, daughter of Johann Mauritz Hauke and sister of Princess Julia of Battenberg:
*Catharina (1830–1834)
*Paul Friedrich (1832–1903) married Countess Maria Anna van Nieppell, had issue
*Alexander (1833–1833)
*Helene Catharina (1835–1915) died unmarried

<doc id="613428" wikidata="Q5643374" url="?curid=613428" title="Halogen (band)">
<text>Halogen were an Australian rock band, formed in Perth, Western Australia in 1997. Founding mainstays were Frans Bisschops on guitar and keyboards and Jasmine Yee on lead vocals – both expatriate New Zealanders. Halogen released three albums, &quot;Save the Ones You Love&quot; (March 2003), &quot;Building on the Edge of the Sky&quot; (July 2004) and &quot;Sirens&quot; (July 2006), before disbanding in 2007.

==History==
Halogen released a five-track debut extended play, &quot;Into the Crash Barrier&quot; (1999). 

They gained national exposure with the track, &quot;Hole Around My Heart&quot;, from their second EP, &quot;Somewhere You&#x27;re Alone&quot; (2001), via Phantom Records/MGM Distribution. 

The group won WAM Song of the Year in 2001 in the Love category. They released a second single, &quot;Walkaway&quot;, in February 2002 and undertook a tour of Australia&#x27;s east coast including performing at the Australian Music Week. The single received airplay on national broadcaster Triple J. A follow-up single, &quot;On a Bridge&quot;, also gained airplay on Triple J. Both singles appeared on their debut album, &quot;Save the Ones You Love&quot; (March 2003), via Karmic Hit, a Sydney-based independent record label formed by Steve Kilbey of the Church. They released a third single, &quot;Caught Me&quot;, in 2003 which was supported by another tour of the eastern coast of Australia.

&quot;Undercover&quot;″s Tim Cashmere reviewed &quot;Save the Ones You Love&quot;, and provided a track-by-track analysis, of the singles he felt that &quot;On a Bridge&quot;, was &quot;Leaning towards the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll influences in the group, [it] is a welcome second. Once again, [Yee&#x27;s] vocal is nothing short of flawless and lyrics that leave the listener intrigued as to what said person was thinking.&quot; &quot;Caught Me&quot;, he observed, &quot;shows the group working with dynamic, another quality so many bands, both local and international are lacking.&quot;

Their second album, &quot;Building on the Edge of the Sky&quot; (July 2004), had Bisschops and Yee providing their compositions to 15 different emerging producers: one each to work on. When it appeared via Karmic Hit, Chris Havercroft of &quot;X-Press Online&quot; observed, &quot;long time purveyors of the dark, brooding, gothic guitar driven pop songs has served them moderately well in the past, however their new found interest in electronic music appears to be a masterstroke.&quot; &quot;FasterLouder&quot;″s Stormin&#x27; Norman compared it to their first album, &quot;[which] is definitely emo-rock, this collection could be described by mutating comparisons to Enya and Propellerheads rather than their usual melancholy selves... [with] dreamy, emotional mood and the subtle use of electronic music effects.&quot;

In February 2006 another EP, &quot;Baby Eyes&quot;, preceded the release of the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Sirens&quot;, which appeared in July of that year. Halogen disbanded in the following year. In addition to her work in Halogen, Yee provided vocals on the Pendulum song, &quot;Sounds of Life&quot; for that group&#x27;s album, &quot;Hold Your Colour&quot; (2005), backing vocals for Fourth Floor Collapse and vocals for &quot;Can&#x27;t let You be Lonely&quot; by the Transients. Bisschops and Yee formed, She Selexx, an electronica project with local producer, Trilby Temperley, who is the older brother of Kavyen Temperley (Eskimo Joe).

<doc id="613433" wikidata="Q438603" url="?curid=613433" title="Grigory Yavlinsky">
<text>Grigory Alekseyevich Yavlinsky (; born 10 April 1952) is a Russian economist and politician. He has held numerous positions in the Soviet and Russian governments across different levels, including in the State Duma.

Yavlinsky was one of authors of the 500 Days Program, a plan for the transition of the Soviet regime to a free-market economy, and is the former leader of the opposition Yabloko party. He has run three times for Russia&#x27;s presidency. In 1996 he ran against Boris Yeltsin, finishing fourth with 7.3% of the vote. In 2000 Yavlinsky ran against Vladimir Putin, finishing third with 5.8%. In the 2012 presidential election he was prevented from running for president by Russian authorities, despite collecting the necessary 2 million signatures of Russian citizens for his candidacy. Yavlinsky was Yabloko&#x27;s candidate for Russian President in the 2018 presidential election, when he ran against Putin and got 1.05% of the vote, according to the results. Many of the election results were not recognised by his party due to corroborated allegations of irregularities.

Yavlinsky holds a PhD in economics from the Central Economic Mathematical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences; his doctoral dissertation was entitled &quot;The socio-economic system of Russia and the problem of its modernisation&quot;. He is a professor at the National Research University Higher School of Economics.

==Early life and career==
Yavlinsky was born in Lviv, Ukrainian SSR. His father, Aleksei Yavlinsky, was an officer, and his mother, Vera Naumovna, a chemistry teacher at an institute. Both his parents are buried in Lviv, while his brother Mikhail still lives there. He is related to Natan Yavlinsky, the nuclear physicist who invented tokamak.

In 1967 and 1968, he was the champion of the Ukrainian SSR in junior boxing. He decided to become an economist during his school years. From 1967 to 1976, he studied at the Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy in Moscow as a labour economist and took a post-graduate course there. While a candidate of economics, he worked in the coal sector. After finishing his postgraduate studies he was employed by the All-Soviet Union Coal Mines Department Research Institute. His job was to draft new unified work instructions for the coal industry. He was the first person in the USSR to complete this assignment. To perform his duties, he had to go down the mines. One of his shifts nearly ended tragically for him when the mine collapsed. Together with four workers, he spent ten hours waist-deep in ice-cold water, waiting for help. Three of his fellow sufferers died in hospital after their rescue. Yavlinsky spent four years at this job. He saw it as an opportunity to see the world hidden behind the propaganda posters. He reported about the horrible conditions in which the coal miners lived and worked, but his reports had no impact.

In 1980, Yavlinsky was assigned to the USSR State Committee for Labour and Social Affairs in charge of the heavy industry sector. In this position he began to develop a project aimed at improving the USSR labour system. He identified two different ways to enhance the efficiency of the system: either establish total control over every move of every worker in the country or alternatively give enterprises more independence. His report on the project did not prove popular with the head of the State Committee for Labour, Yury Batalin. The KGB confiscated 600 draft copies of Yavlinsky&#x27;s report and interrogated him several times. When Brezhnev died in 1982, the KGB finally left Yavlinsky alone. However, he had to stop working as he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and sent to a closed medical facility for nine months. The drafts of his report were burned together with his other personal belongings as contagious.

From 1984, he held a management position at the Labour Ministry and then at the Council of Ministers of the USSR. In this capacity, he had to join Communist Party of the Soviet Union, of which he was a member in 1985–1991. He was head of the Joint Economic Department of the Government of the USSR. In 1989, he was made department head of the Statement Commission for Economic Reforms run by Academician Leonid Abalkin.

== Deputy Premiership and economic reforms (1990–1992) ==
Yavlinsky&#x27;s commitment to a market economy was established in 1990 when he wrote 500 Days – a programme for the Soviet Union in which he proposed the rapid transition from a centrally planned economy to a free market economy in less than two years. To implement the programme, Yavlinsky was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR and Deputy Chairman of the State Commission for Economic Reform. President of the USSR Mikhail Gorbachev decided to combine Yavlinsky&#x27;s programme with another one which had been developed simultaneously. The other programme, &quot;The Main Directives for Development&quot;, had been created by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers Nikolai Ryzhkov, who threatened to resign if his project was rejected. In October 1990, when it became clear that his programme would not be implemented, Yavlinsky resigned from the government. He then established his own think tank, EPICenter, which brought together many members of his 500 Days team who were to become his future associates in Yabloko (Sergei Ivanenko, Aleksei Melnikov, Aleksei Mikhailov, etc.).

In the summer of 1991, while working in Harvard, he co-authored a new reform programme jointly with Graham Allison, which offered a platform for Gorbachev&#x27;s negotiations with the G7 over financial aid in support of a transition to a market economy. After the defeat of the hardline August 1991 coup against Gorbachev and Yeltsin, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Management of the National Economy which operated in place of Soviet government. The new President of the RSFSR Boris Yeltsin asked Yavlinsky to return to the government and even considered making him Prime Minister. In this role Yavlinsky successfully negotiated an economic union among Soviet republics. The agreement was signed by representatives of twelve republics in Alma-Ata on 18 October 1991. However, when Yeltsin signed the Belavezh Accords, which led to the breakup of the Soviet Union and the rupture of all political and economic connections between the former Soviet republics, Yavlinsky left again as a sign of protest against Yeltsin&#x27;s actions. A year later, Yavlinsky started his own political career.

When the &quot;shock therapy&quot; reforms were launched by Yeltsin and Yegor Gaidar in January 1992, Yavlinsky became an outspoken critic of these policies, emphasising the differences between his programme and Gaidar&#x27;s reform programme (such as the sequencing of privatisation versus the liberalisation of prices and the applicability of his program to the entire Soviet Union):&quot;Certainly, they have no program. They have some elements of policy . . . and they are very contradictory&quot;.In 1992, Yavlinsky served as advisor to Boris Nemtsov who was at the time the Governor of Nizhny Novgorod Region. Yavlinsky developed a regional economic reform programme for Nemtsov. Later, however, their paths diverged, as Nemtsov sided with Yeltsin&#x27;s government on most issues, eventually becoming deputy prime minister and one of the founders and leaders of the Union of Right Forces, while Yavlinsky became the leader of the liberal opposition to Yeltsin.

== Activities during the Yeltsin administration (1993–2000) ==
In 1993, as the conflict intensified between Yeltsin and the parliament over the shock therapy programme, Yavlinsky had high ratings in the polls as a potential presidential candidate and the image of an independent, centrist politician, untainted by corruption. In September–October 1993, he joined a group of senior politicians who tried to mediate between Yeltsin and the parliament. However, after the outbreak of hostilities on the streets of Moscow on 3 October, he unequivocally called on Yeltsin to use force against militants on the streets and other armed supporters of the parliament.

When Yeltsin set the date for the elections to the new parliament and a constitutional referendum for 12 December 1993, Yavlinsky had to cobble together an electoral bloc in haste, as he had no party of his own, and had to recruit existing parties as co-founders. His bloc was co-founded by three of them, the Republican Party of the Russian Federation, Social Democratic Party of Russia and Christian Democratic Party of Russia, all three tilting on most issues toward the Yeltsin camp.

The top three names on the slate – Yavlinsky, Yury Boldyrev (former State Controller and disaffected democrat) and Vladimir Lukin (at the time Russia&#x27;s ambassador to the US) – gave the bloc its initial name, &quot;Yavlinsky-Boldyrev-Lukin&quot;, abbreviated as YABLOKO. With no prior electoral experience, Yabloko succeeded in winning 7.9% of the vote in December 1993 and forming the fifth largest faction in the Duma. After Boldyrev clashed with Yavlinsky over a draft law on production-sharing agreements and left the bloc in 1995, the name was retained, but now reinterpreted as the &quot;Yavlinsky Bloc&quot;. In 1995, the Yabloko caucus in the Duma set up its own political association which was reincorporated as a political party in 2001.

One of the features distinguishing the party from other liberal parties was its critique of Yeltsin&#x27;s policies, from the economic &quot;shock therapy&quot; and the handling of the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis to the First Chechen War and Russia&#x27;s relations with the West. Yavlinsky established himself as a leader of the democratic opposition. In this capacity, he was a principled opponent of Gaidar&#x27;s Russia&#x27;s Choice and its successors in parliament, such as the Union of Right Forces. In turn, they accused him of being too inflexible and blamed his personality for the failure to merge with other democrats in order to mount a concentrated electoral challenge to the hardline forces. Others, however, admitted that there were philosophical differences between Yavlinsky&#x27;s unspoken social democratic bent and the neoliberal orientation of his democratic opponents.

In September 1998, after Russia&#x27;s 1998 financial crash brought down Sergei Kirienko&#x27;s government, Yavlinsky proposed the candidacy of Yevgeny Primakov who was elected Prime Minister in spite of resistance from Yeltsin, his family and entourage. This helped resolve the political stalemate and many credit Primakov with rescuing the economy from chaos and with the start of the recovery of the industrial production that continued under Vladimir Putin. However, Yavlinsky declined Primakov&#x27;s offer to join his Communist-dominated government as deputy prime minister for social policies and soon joined the ranks of his critics on the liberal side. Later in 1999 Yavlinsky criticised Primakov as a throwback to the stagnation days of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. Interfax quoted him saying on one occasion: &quot;This Brezhnev style of government absolutely does not suit us&quot;. Yavlinsky said Primakov relied too much on communists and other leftists who do not understand modern economics. However, Yavlinsky warned Yeltsin against sacking the entire government, as he believed that this would have set up a showdown with the State Duma of the kind that had led Primakov to be appointed Prime Minister in the first place.

In May 1999, Yavlinsky joined forces with the Communist Party in an attempt to impeach Yeltsin. The news media had been full of speculation that if the Duma were to proceed with the impeachment, Yeltsin might retaliate by firing the communist-backed Cabinet of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. This would have precipitated a political crisis and the possible dissolution of the Duma and threatened the political stability that Primakov has brought Russia since previous summer. Of the four charges of impeachment, the one accusing Yeltsin of abuse of power in connection with war in Chechnya garnered the most support from both parties. Yavlinsky said that this was a warning to all politicians that they would be judged for their actions. Just as the Communists began to nod their assent, Yavlinsky attacked them, dismissing the other charges as politically inspired. He said that Yeltsin had made serious mistakes, sometimes fateful, during the reforms, which had led to the bankruptcy of the country, not out of a desire to destroy Russia, but because he was  unable to make a break with his past, and that he had not intended to destroy or liquidate anyone, and did not have such a conscious goal. In summary, Yavlinsky declared:Such indifference and negligence is a long-time tradition of the Communist-Bolshevik leaders from whose midst he (Yeltsin) rose and with whom his entire biography is linked. The Communist regime headed by Stalin deliberately murdered tens of millions of citizens of various nationalities. The party which proclaims as its historical leaders and heroes Lenin and Stalin, the ideologists and organizers of massive crimes against humanity, assumes responsibility for these atrocities with cynical pride.Although Yavlinsky&#x27;s repeated statements that all the party&#x27;s 46 State Duma deputies would vote unanimously in favour of the charge on the Chechen war, eight defected and sided with Yeltsin. The outcome was still 17 votes short of the two-thirds majority (300 votes) needed to start impeachment proceedings.

In 1996 and 2000, Yavlinsky ran for president with the backing of his party and other organizations. In 1996 presidential elections he came fourth and received 7.3% of the vote. In the 2000 presidential elections he finished third and received 5.8% of the vote. In both cases, he did not subsequently offer his support to either Yeltsin or Putin or their Communist opponent in both elections, Gennady Zyuganov.

Yavlinsky never concealed his lukewarm view of the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 which occurred while he was negotiating an economic treaty among the republics. However, he never advocated a restoration of the Soviet Union or a revision of post-Soviet borders.

Yavlinsky was at times critical of US policies toward Russia, particularly under the Clinton administration. Some of his most trenchant criticisms are contained in his lecture at the Nobel Institute delivered in May 2000.

== Activities under Putin&#x27;s first and second administrations (2000–2008) ==

Under the Putin presidency, Yavlinsky remained an active opponent of any military solution to the problems in Chechnya. In 2002, he took part in the negotiations with the Chechen terrorists during the Moscow theatre hostage crisis and was praised by President Vladimir Putin for his role in the standoff. His party also campaigned against imports of radioactive waste into Russia, thereby building a crucial alliance with environmental NGOs, as well as with human rights organisations, labour unions, women associations, and ethnic minority groups. He was also an uncompromising critic of the government reforms under Putin of the housing and utilities sector and the energy sector. On a number of occasions the Yabloko faction in the State Duma initiated petitioning campaigns for the resignation of the government.

Yavlinsky has had difficult relations with the authorities both under Yeltsin and under Putin. While supporting Putin&#x27;s early foreign policies of developing closer ties to the United States, he remained critical of domestic policies, in particular the arrest of Mikhail Khodorkovsky in the fall of 2003. He became even more outspoken about the assault on democratic freedoms in Russia and insisted that Putin&#x27;s policies represented a direct continuation of Yeltsin&#x27;s policies.

In the 2003 elections to the Duma, Yabloko failed to cross the 5% threshold of Duma representation. Yavlinsky later recalled that Putin had telephoned him early on election night to congratulate him, apparently believing – or pretending to believe – that Yabloko had succeeded in gaining representation.

Yavlinsky refused to run for president in 2004, claiming that Putin had rigged the elections to the point of making them meaningless.

After the Yabloko Party failed again to secure representation in the 2007 Russian legislative election, there was some possibility that Yavlinsky might run again for presidency in 2008. However, Yabloko and Yavlinsky himself supported the longshot and largely symbolic candidacy of émigré dissident Vladimir Bukovsky who in the end failed to clear legal obstacles to his registration.

On 22 June 2008, Yavlinsky stepped down as party leader at Yabloko&#x27;s 15th congress, proposing in his place the candidacy of Moscow City Duma deputy Sergey Mitrokhin who was elected as the new party chairman. Yavlinsky remained a member of Yabloko&#x27;s Political Committee (elected there with the largest number of votes) and a regular spokesman for the party, particularly in local election campaigns.

== Post-financial crisis (2008–2011) ==
In an interview at HSE&#x27;s conference Yavlinsky stated that common disease for all states in the late 20th century – early 21st century was the merger of the state with business. According to Yavlinsky, this is a key trigger of the economic crisis in the US. A fusion of Wall Street and the White House paralyzed all the possibilities of Barack Obama other than the injection of fresh money in the old economy. Such an approach has no future owing to the level of public debt and poor quality of the state in decision making, he told.

According to Yavlinsky, the global financial crisis of 2007–2009 happened owing to the appearance of insurance-backed loans, which led to a dramatic increase in the number and volume of such loans. If a business goes insolvent, creditors are paid by the insurance. This created the impression that the loans were safe. However, the reliability of borrowers declined. When too many extremely unreliable loans were issued in the United States, at some point a number of borrowers went insolvent at the same time, making it impossible to pay the insurance, Yavlinsky wrote. As a result, no money was returned to the lenders. As a result, the biggest banks and investment companies went bankrupt. In simple terms, this is a gigantic &quot;financial pyramid&quot; (Ponzi scheme), he says.Let&#x27;s assume you borrow from someone, but things don&#x27;t work out. However, you still need to pay them back and pay the interest. So you borrow from someone else paying them interest. To pay back, you borrow more, and so on and so on until it ends in failure. The enormous scale of the &quot;financial pyramid&quot; became possible because of extremely lax financial regulation of the government.In his opinion, the crisis could have been resolved by bankrupting all the financiers and bankers responsible. However, as there were too many of them, and in many respects the economy was dependent on them, such an approach might engender even greater social problems. In addition, they are so integrated in the US power elites. Therefore, owing to fears of social unrest, the US government saved them by giving them funds financed by the taxpayers, in the end helping the parties that were actually responsible for the crisis. Applying this approach, the officials hoped that the economy would work and would start to grow after receiving a huge infusion. However, economic activity didn&#x27;t grow despite the US$750 billion injected by the Bush administration and the US$800 billion invested by the Obama administration because of market distrust.

In the book Realeconomik: The Hidden Cause of the Great Recession (and How to Avert the Next One), Yavlinsky makes the case that a stable global economy cannot be achieved without a commitment to established social principles in business and politics:The title and subtitle reflect the central idea of the book: the cause of the crisis is that at the core, modern capitalism is concerned with money and power, not ideals, morals, or principles. The word Realeconomik is used as an analogue to Realpolitik, a pejorative term for politics that masquerades as practicality while in fact comprising the cynicism, coercion, and amorality of Machiavellian principles. An entire generation of Western politicians, businessmen, and economists has come of age without ever thinking seriously about the relationship between morality and economics or ethics and politics. I do not seek to make any moral judgments: I aim instead to be descriptive and analytical. My goal is to indicate those areas that are usually not discussed in public. I feel the urgency to state clearly the things that I believe to be crucial to understanding the events unfolding before our eyes. The nature of the Great Recession is not only economic, or perhaps not even attributable mainly to economic factors. Neither is it the product of mere complacency and negligence of duty on the part of authorities and top-level managers in the private sector, as some experts insist. Rather, the underlying fundamentals and causes go deeper – to such things as general rules of society and the logic to which they are subject, encompassing the issues of individual and social values, moral guidance, and public control, as well as their evolution over the past several decades. These issues are much more serious and have a greater impact on economic performance than is customarily believed.Yavlinsky argues that the world of money should not be viewed as separate from culture and society: he believes that the financial crisis was merely a symptom of a wider moral collapse, and that it is time to examine how we live:Even comparatively sophisticated ways of responding to this crisis, as proposed by many, such as writing new, stringent rules, exercising more public control over their enforcement, imposing taxes on some kinds of financial operations, and the like will not resolve fundamental problems, which are not simply economic. Far less will be achieved by simply &quot;pouring money on the crisis,&quot; even if it is accompanied by exposing the banking secrets of thousands of officials and businessmen. There are no ready-made solutions to these problems. However, I hope Realeconomik will provide a fresh perspective for anyone concerned about another bursting bubble, persistently high unemployment, the &quot;new normal&quot; (economic stagnation in a low-growth, low-inflation environment), financial volatility, sharply rising poverty rates (even in industrialised nations such as the United States), and social unrest, or the possibility of something more catastrophic. It is difficult to talk about the economy from the perspective of morality, as the very concept of morality seems to be devoid of established content, is subject to broad interpretation, and is often rather elusive. But those difficulties seem insufficient reason to exclude morality from economic analysis and research. It is essential to treat the issue of morality seriously and extensively to provide a meaningful perspective for economic processes and their consequences, especially in the framework of long term analysis.

== Tenure as a regional legislator (2011–2016) ==

=== Mass protests and campaigns ===
In September 2011 Yavlinsky was appointed head of the electoral list of Yabloko Party for the State Duma elections of the sixth convocation by a resolution of the party&#x27;s congress. According to the official results of the elections held on 4 December 2011, Yabloko failed to surmount the five per cent barrier and as a result was not accorded any seats in the Russian parliament. However, the party gained more votes than in previous elections (3.43%), thereby securing state financing. At the same time, Yabloko candidates were elected in three regions, including the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg where the party won 12.5% of the votes and six mandates. Yavlinsky, who also headed the party list for these elections, agreed to head the Yabloko fraction in Saint Petersburg and received the mandate of a state deputy on 14 December 2011.

On 18 December 2011 Yavlinsky was nominated by the Yabloko Party congress as the party&#x27;s candidate for the Russian presidential elections scheduled for 4 March 2012. On 18 January 2011 he submitted to the Central Electoral Commission of the Russian Federation the 2 million signatures in support of his candidacy required to participate in the elections. After checking the signatures, the commission claimed to have identified photocopies of signatures and refused to register Yavlinsky as a candidate, rejecting 25.66% of the submitted signatures on the grounds that they were defective.

On 8 February 2012 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation rejected Yavlinsky&#x27;s appeal against the decision of the Central Electoral Commission, finding the decision not to register his candidacy to be legal. Commenting on his disqualification, Yavlinsky declared that the decision was politically motivated.

Yavlinsky actively supported the protests in Russia in December 2011 – March 2012 against the falsifications during the elections and was a frequent speaker at the meetings &quot;For Fair Elections&quot; in Moscow. On 14 and 15 May he visited Saint Isaac&#x27;s Square in Saint Petersburg where the opposition camp was located. He participated in the &quot;March of Millions&quot; in Moscow on 6 May and 12 June.  

=== Legislation ===
At the elections of deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg of the 5th convocation Yavlinsky was the only candidate in the municipal part of Yabloko&#x27;s list and on this basis headed the party at the Saint Petersburg elections. According to official data, the party won 12.5% of the votes and formed a faction of six deputies in the city parliament. Throughout his term as a deputy  (December 2011 to September 2016), Yavlinsky worked in Saint Petersburg several days a week, while continuing to live in Moscow. He participated in plenary sessions, committee sessions, would see constituents and address their concerns.

During his work at the legislative assembly Yavlinsky prepared the conceptual strategy &quot;Greater Saint Petersburg. 21st Century&quot;, which combined economic, spatial and time-based approaches to the development of the entire metropolitan area of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Region – Greater Saint Petersburg. It was submitted in February 2015 to the Governor of the city Georgy Poltavchenko. In April 2015 Yavlinsky outlined the key concepts of the document to representatives of the authorities and business of Saint Petersburg and Leningrad Region at the first strategic session held as part of preparations for the forum &quot;Harmony of Versatility&quot;.

During the five years of work of the Yabloko fraction headed by Yavlinsky, Saint Petersburg&#x27;s parliament adopted 25 per cent of the numerous initiatives proposed by Yabloko&#x27;s deputies (almost 100 in total).

=== Opposition to the Russo-Ukrainian War ===
At the end of February 2014 Yavlinsky published in the Russian business daily Vedomosti an article with the heading &quot;Russia is creating a zone of instability around its borders&quot;. He wrote that a social contract had existed in Ukraine until the end of autumn 2013: the people had been prepared to endure Yanukovych as long as they could see the country moving towards Europe. Yavlinsky notes in the article that on the eve of the signing of the EU Association Agreement, it became clear that the European option was not splitting the country: on the contrary, it was bringing people together. Notwithstanding all the serious Ukrainian internal drivers of the evolving crisis, it was primarily attributable to developments in Russia:Russia&#x27;s unnatural refusal to move along the European path implies a rift in the post-Soviet space. The Ukrainian crisis is the result of this rift. Instead of moving together with Ukraine towards Europe, Russia is trying to draw the country in the diametrically opposing direction. Through its renunciation of the European vector, Russia is creating a zone of instability, as virtually all its Western and even southern neighbours are in the final analysis striving for Europe. Accordingly, all these countries will have significant forces fighting Russia&#x27;s plans to hold them back and not let them go. Sooner or later the instability caused by this erroneous anti-European course will also come to Russia itself.On 16 March 2014, on the eve of the referendum in Crimea, Yavlinsky published an article in the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta entitled: &quot;Peace, not war. How to achieve the former and prevent the latter&quot;. In the article, he wrote in particular:The positions and actions of the powers-that-be in Russia in respect of Ukraine and in connection with developments there are a reckless political adventure.

We believe that it is absolutely unacceptable to even raise the idea of using Russian troops in Ukraine. This is the position held by Yabloko.

We also believe that the separation of Crimea from Ukraine and its annexation is an error at the national level.

The fundamental goal of such a policy implemented by the leadership of our country is clear. This is the positioning of Ukraine as a &quot;failed state&quot;, which is popular among the entourage close to the powers that be. They tend to believe that it is in Russia&#x27;s interests to push Ukraine into political degradation and territorial collapse, or to transform it into a puppet state.

We are convinced that it is in Russia&#x27;s interests to make an immediate break with such ideology and to bring such policies to an end.

The immediate result of Crimea&#x27;s annexation would be to transform Russia into a country with zero reputation and borders that are not recognised internationally.In the same article Yavlinsky advocated the immediate convening of an International Conference on political, legal and military issues related to Ukraine, in particular, on a range of Crimean issues. In October 2014, the Federal Political Committee of the Yabloko Party on the initiative of Grigory Yavlinsky adopted a decision to assess developments in the Donbas, stating in particular:The annexation of Crimea and transfer of Russian weapons to so-called &quot;separatists&quot;, the sending of volunteers to them, propaganda and military support from Russia – all these factors can be defined as &quot;warmongering&quot;.On 13 December 2014 at a Yabloko Party meeting, Grigory Yavlinsky advocated the creation of a &quot;buffer zone&quot; between Russia and Ukraine, with the participation of international observers, negotiations with Ukraine&#x27;s leadership, the removal of mercenaries and materiel from the country and the provision of guarantees to the public which should in the end lead to the holding of a &quot;legitimate referendum&quot; on the status of Crimea organised under Ukrainian law &quot;so that this problem does not haunt Russia forever&quot;. &quot;We need to say: Yes, Crimea is not our territory&quot;.  At the same time, Yavlinsky stated that Crimea&#x27;s future should be determined by the inhabitants of the peninsula on the basis of respective legislation: &quot;We hold that the referendum on 16 March 2014 was illegal, conducted in a rush with utter disregard for any rules, laws and norms and under the &quot;protection&quot; of the Russian Armed Forces.&quot; &quot;I want my country to have internationally recognised borders. I want people living in Crimea to be fully-fledged citizens of Europe. However, the key is that this issue should be resolved in such a way that Russia can say: We are a European country, we are building our future together with Europe on the same rules governing how hundreds of millions of people live&quot;. The politician proposed that a &quot;legal and legitimate referendum (or local referenda with prospects of the cantonisation of Crimea)&quot; be held based on Ukrainian legislation and international norms of law &quot;agreed with Kyiv, the Crimean authorities, Russia, the EU, OBSE and the United Nations.&quot; Such a referendum conducted under stringent international control should contain three questions: whether the people want to live as part of Ukraine, as an independent Crimean state or as part of Russia.

Yavlinsky and Yabloko prioritised the topics of the war in Donbas and the annexation of Crimea during the party&#x27;s election campaign for the State Duma of the 7th convocation in 2016. During the election campaign, on federal TV channels, Yavlinsky repeatedly criticised the Kremlin&#x27;s policy in Ukraine and disclosed that Russian citizens were participating in the military actions in Ukraine.

In 2017 Yavlinsky developed a peace plan for Donbas consisting of 10 points. The plan provided guarantees for the long-term safety of the region&#x27;s inhabitants and proposed an end to the war. It was one of the key policy documents of Yavlinsky&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2018.

== 2016 parliamentary elections ==
A Yabloko Party congress held in July 2016 established the electoral list of the party&#x27;s candidates for the elections to the State Duma of the 7th convocation. Based on the party&#x27;s voting results, Yavlinsky was elected head of the federal list of the Yabloko Party.

Yavlinsky stated that the State Duma campaign should be perceived exclusively as part of preparations for the Russian presidential elections in 2018. On 23 April 2016 at a meeting of the Political Committee of the Yabloko Party, Yavlinsky declared that the expansion of the powers of the employees of the law enforcement authorities in the law &quot;On the Police&quot; and the creation of Rosgvardiya (National Guard of the Russian Federation) were actions adopted by the regime to prepare for the 2018 presidential elections, which will become the &quot;bifurcation point&quot;:  The presidential elections – these represent possibly the last chance for peaceful regime change with no spilling of blood.At the Yabloko Party congress in July 2016 Yavlinsky declared that society must establish a comprehensive alternative to Vladimir Putin at the impending presidential elections, and start fighting for this choice:Without this step, it will not prove possible to change the regime in Russia peacefully and legally, and there is simply no other method.Yabloko&#x27;s election programme entitled &quot;Respect for the Individual&quot; stated:This is a programme for the transition from a state of war to a state of peace, from the power of corruption to the power of law, from state lies to truth, from injustice to justice, from violence to dignity, from humiliation of the individual to respect for the individual.Yabloko&#x27;s experts drafted a package of more than 140 draft laws in 20 different sectors that they planned to submit to the State Duma if elected. The draft laws included the &quot;Land-Home-Roads&quot; programme developed by Yavlinsky and a set of laws to overcome the consequences of the criminal privatisation of the mid-1990s. In addition, Yavlinsky proposed his own Economic Manifesto to the regime: the economic programme prioritised the adoption of a clear and unambiguous decision in favour of economic development and growth as the goal of both economic and state policy.  

Representing the party in election debates on federal TV channels and radio stations, Yavlinsky reiterated the need to settle the military conflict in Donbas and resolve the Crimean issue. He dubbed the Russo-Ukrainian War a crime and condemned the military operation in Syria as senseless. He noted that the Russian economy was being destroyed by politics, and that if this did not stop, Russia might soon end up as an underdeveloped country for good, inevitably leading to the country&#x27;s collapse, given its size and borders with the most unstable regions.

According to the official results, Yabloko Party won 1.99% of the total votes (1,051,535 votes) in the State Duma elections. Immediately after they were announced, the party&#x27;s leadership issued a statement rejecting the results and accusing the authorities of tampering with actual electoral turnout and falsifying the voting. The party declared:The State Duma has for the first time in the new Russian history been formed by a minority of the country&#x27;s population. Consequently, it does not represent Russian society and is not a body of popular representation. Tampering with the actual turnout, instances of mass compulsory voting, as well as direct falsification during the counting of the votes and drafting of the protocols, does not make it possible to declare the federal elections held on 18 September to be honest and legitimate.Summarising the election results, Yavlinsky said that the importance of Yabloko&#x27;s participation in these elections was to tell the truth: on the criminal nature of the war with Ukraine, the senselessness of the war in Syria, the need to rectify the Crimean problem, the depleted nature of the economic system and the dead end facing the country. Against this backdrop, the party had participated in the elections to create the requisite conditions for the peaceful transformation of the system. In the opinion of Yabloko&#x27;s leader, this can only be achieved through the transparent and coherent demonstration that millions of people in Russia support such a position.

== 2018 presidential elections ==
In June 2015 the Yabloko Party declared that it was necessary to establish an alternative to Vladimir Putin as the only effective strategy of the democratic opposition and proposed Yavlinsky for this role three years before the presidential election.

The following is taken from the decision of the Federal Political Committee of Yabloko &quot;On the Political Strategy of the Party to 2018&quot;:The key is that this should not be &quot;someone like Putin, but without corruption&quot;, not Putin 2.0, but instead a politician with different convictions, personal qualities, thinking and a modus operandi in politics that is diametrically opposed to Putin&#x27;s approach since 2000 and to the system which begat him – since the time of the foundation of our Party at the start of the 1990s. Yavlinsky also personifies today a categorical rejection of aggression, annexation and war as a means to build a &quot;Russian world&quot; and the Russian authoritative-oligarchic political and economic system, which inevitably led to the current exclusively hazardous and dead-end political situation.In summer 2017, as part of preparations for the presidential elections, Yabloko conducted a wide-ranging campaign for the withdrawal of Russian armed forces from Syria and the allocation of the freed-up resources in 2017 to deal with the country&#x27;s internal needs. The renunciation of geopolitical adventures in favour of internal development became the key talking point of Yavlinsky&#x27;s presidential programme. In a short period over 100,000 signatures were collected throughout Russia. The campaign entitled &quot;Time to return home&quot; also had a significant impact on the public mood. According to the opinion polls, during the campaign the number of advocates for the withdrawal of Russian forces from Syria increased to 50%.

The issue of terminating military actions in the East of Ukraine and determining Crimea&#x27;s status dominated Yavlinsky&#x27;s election campaign. In 2017 Yavlinsky developed a peace plan for the Donbas, consisting of 10 points. The plan included a guarantee of long-term safety for the inhabitants of the regime and an end to the war. This plan was one of the key policy documents of Yavlinsky&#x27;s 2018 presidential campaign. Yavlinsky dedicated a special online project entitled &quot;However, is Crimea our territory?&quot; to the topic of determining Crimea&#x27;s status, where he advocated, inter alia, convening an international conference and explained how to prevent a war between Russian and Ukraine.
Other key positions of Yavlinsky&#x27;s presidential campaign included the restoration of direct mayoral elections and the implementation of a new budget policy. He insisted on a change in the tax allocation structure to favour regions and municipalities, as well as a change in budget expenditure priorities – from the financing of the security, defence and law enforcement authorities and the state bureaucracy to social expenditure.

Yavlinsky cited the rise in poverty as a key indicator of the detrimental nature of Russia&#x27;s politics. He held that reducing poverty and eliminating the excessive stratification of society was the priority objective that the new President of Russia would have to resolve. To achieve this goal, he proposed such measures as exempting the poorest population strata from tax, a one-time windfall tax on major earnings obtained based on the results of the fraudulent cash-for-share auctions conducted in the 1990s, the creation of personal accounts of Russian citizens that would be used for the transfer of revenues from the sale of natural resources, the implementation of the &quot;Land-Homes-Roads&quot; programme. Yavlinsky&#x27;s programme also prioritised reforms of the judiciary, the inviolability of private property, the independence of the mass media and online freedom.

When participating in the presidential elections, Yavlinsky was aware that he would not defeat the current Head of State Vladimir Putin. He ran on the assumption that a high level of support for the candidate from the democratic opposition would lead to material adjustments to current policies.A change in policy is vital. There is significant demand in our society for a ruthless dictator.  If I am unable to show that different policies enjoy significant backing, then the former demand will be met. When a responsible leader is backed by 10 million people, when they speak the truth frankly and directly, the situation in the country and our life as well starts to change. Such a significant number of people cannot be ignored. The ideas and proposals of their candidate will have to be considered&quot; (from an interview with the radio station Echo Moskvy on 12 January 2018)Shortly before the start of the election campaign, Yavlinsky published an article in mid-December 2017 in Novaya Gazeta entitled &quot;My Truth&quot;, where he wrote that the forthcoming &quot;elections&quot; were not elections, but rather the equivalent of an &quot;electoral Halloween&#x27; and that in these circumstances, the reason for his participation was:…to fight for truth against the backdrop of lies, Bolshevism and obscurantism, a fight against a real and dangerous political mafia which is leading my country to the precipice. The fight for truth is not comfortable and you have to pay. Formal humiliation over percentages, abuse, undue pressure, gossip from the political in-crowd  – this is the price I am ready to pay.On 22 December 2017 Yavlinsky was officially nominated as the Yabloko Party&#x27;s candidate in the presidential elections. On 7 February 2018 he was officially registered by the Central Electoral Commission.

During the three-month campaign Yavlinsky travelled almost 40,000 kilometres, visited 20 cities and 16 Russian regions.

According to the official results announced on 18 March 2018, Yavlinsky won 1.05% of the votes and came fifth. However, the Yabloko Party stressed that the &quot;voting results do not reflect the actual results of the elections&quot;, as the presidential elections had been transformed into a &quot;plebiscite on support for the current president&quot;.  

At the end of March 2018 Yavlinsky published an article in the Russian daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta entitled &quot;The elections were won by a significant minority&quot;, in which he analysed the overall election campaign and its results and forecast developments in the country: The politics of Vladimir Putin are destroying the economy and there are no premises for expecting any change. The Kremlin may appoint an inveterate liberal as a minister, &quot;toning down&quot; slightly the anti-West rhetoric and saying something about freedom. However, the key cause of domestic problems and external sanctions is not rhetoric, but instead the political and economic system and political policy which remains unchanged. That is why everyone lost the elections: both the participants, the people who called for a boycott, the people who simply didn&#x27;t turn up to vote, the majority of people who voted for Putin, honest left wingers and national patriots. And they did not simply lose the elections – they lost any hope of a future. An absolute minority won, who piggyback on politics leading the country to a dangerous dead-end. This is the crux of these developments.

== Position on the 2020 coronavirus pandemic ==
In March 2020 Yavlinsky and the Yabloko Party developed and proposed for implementation an anti-crisis plan to combat the consequences of the pandemic, including  an increase in healthcare expenses, compensation and subsidised assistance for individuals who were suffering and a whole range of benefits and alleviation of the tax burden on small and medium-size business which had missed out on revenue owing to COVID-19 related restrictions. Yavlinsky asserted that the state had sufficient funds to implement the anti-crisis plan – they could be taken from the National Welfare Fund and the country&#x27;s foreign currency and gold reserves. However, such expenditure was not part of the Kremlin&#x27;s plans. As the mass media reported, all the country&#x27;s financial reserves were intended for a &quot;rainy day&quot;, as confirmed by the events in Ukraine in 2022. The Russian government studied Yabloko&#x27;s plan, but refused to implement it.  In May 2020 in his article  &quot;After Lockdown&quot; Yavlinsky stated that the Russian state would not invest in the economy, because Putin was preparing for confrontation with the West and had been setting aside all the resources deemed necessary to achieve this goal:The state might, by making a serious effort, be able to extricate the economy from a post-lockdown torpor. However, Russia&#x27;s regime is of poor quality and accordingly does not have any smart policies. Putin&#x27;s regime will not invest the amount in the economy that is objectively required, as it considers the fight with the West to be its historical mission, and not the creation of a modern economy and an increase in the prosperity of its citizens. This is the crux of the Russian crisis and not COVID-19. The focus of the Russian establishment on the fight with the West is becoming dangerous for Russia and the world.

== Opposition to the 2020 constitutional amendments ==

On 15 January 2020 the Russian President Vladimir Putin, in his appeal to the Federal Assembly, declared that amendments should be introduced to the existing Constitution of the Russian Federation, including repudiation of international law in Russia, the consolidation of power in the hands of one individual – the President, as well as the lifting of restrictions on the terms of office of the President, which would enable the existing Head of State to hold this post until 2036. Yavlinsky castigated the proposed amendments  — both in terms of their nature and the form used to introduce them – without any public debate, without alternative proposals and through the holding of an illegal referendum. On 21 January 2020 Yavlinsky announced the start of work on an alternative package of amendments to the Constitution, including the drafting and submission of fundamentally different amendments to the Constitution to the court of public opinion. This led to the foundation of the Public Constitutional Council, which included politicians, public figures and journalists. Leading  experts on constitutional law in Russia were also involved. A package of amendments was prepared, which – unlike the ones proposed by Putin – were intended to strengthen the 1993 Constitution and &quot;implement the idea of expanding the participation of individuals in the life of the state and create a system of authentic people power and the supremacy of the law.&quot;  Yabloko Party deputies in regional legislative assemblies introduced alternative amendments for consideration by the State Duma.

A referendum on the introduction of amendments to the Constitution was held from 25 June to 1 July, in violation of all the legislative norms of the Russian Federation. According to the official results, over 78% of Russian citizens voted for Putin&#x27;s amendments (on the eve of the referendum, according to the independent polling organisation Levada Center, the alternative package of the amendments drafted the Public Constitutional Council enjoyed the backing of 28% of Russians, while 25% of the respondents said that they supported Putin&#x27;s amendments). Immediately after the voting, Yavlinsky declared that this was the ill-fated end of the era of post-Soviet modernisation and the start of the destruction of law for the country as a whole. In August Yavlinsky&#x27;s work &quot;The Day After. On the end of a lost era and the outlook for the future&quot; was published, where he summarised the results of almost three decades of the abortive post-Soviet modernisation of Russia.

== Comments about Alexei Navalny (2021) ==
After the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny and his subsequent arrest in Russia, Yavlinsky repeatedly called for an investigation into poisonings in Russia and the creation of an international investigative group. 

On the eve of the street protests in support of Navalny, the Yabloko Party issued a statement on 22 January 2021 in which it demanded the release of all political prisoners in Russia – at the time over 300 people,  including Alexey Navalny. The party also demanded that the federal and regional authorities show maximum restraint and refrain from violence against participations in peaceful political actions. Yabloko also called on the protest organisers and participants to display the maximum caution and responsibility:The regime will use unlimited brutality and power against the participants in the protest. The protesters must understand the serious danger that they are exposing both themselves to and the people they are calling on to take to the streets. Calls for the participation of minors in unsanctioned protests are categorically inadmissible. Such calls are criminally irresponsible, whoever makes them.After the first protests and mass detentions of participants in the protests, Navalny&#x27;s headquarters declared on 4 February that subsequent protests might be held in spring 2021. Navalny&#x27;s closest companion and one of the protest organisers Leonid Volkov admitted that he had called on people to take to the streets in order to attract the maximum possible public attention to the case against Navalny. Volkov declared: &quot;At the time we had to cast everyone into the hearth. However, we had no other choice. We had to do this to consolidate public support prior to the decision of the court … And we achieved this goal at a high cost – …12,000 detainees.&quot; On 6 February 2021 Yavlinsky published the article: &quot;No to Putinism and Populism&quot; in which he analysed protest activism in Russia over the past ten years and also evaluated critically populist policies, holding that populism in politics poses a threat globally, including Russia:Unleashing class populism in Russia, provoking confrontation between the rich and poor, will not lead to anything positive. The nationalist ploy of whipping up society for the sake of the battle against Putin was one of the drivers for spring 2014, with the annexation of Crimea and war in Ukraine.Yavlinsky also roundly criticised Navalny&#x27;s political line, calling it &quot;populism and nationalism&quot; – in particular, this concerned Navalny&#x27;s participation in the nationalist &quot;Russian Marches&quot;, his calls to bomb Tbilisi during the war with Georgia, and also his statements on the status of Crimea and the war in Donbas. In the article Yavlinsky warned against backing such a political line, noting that choosing between two evils never turns out well:&lt;...&gt; today the new propagandists calling themselves members of the opposition, browbeat people tired with the immutability of the regime and corruption about Putinism. They consciously prompt them to choose the lesser of two evils, but do not say that the lesser evil, after conquering the bigger evil, always becomes even bigger than the original.

After the publication of the article &quot;No to Putin and Populism&quot;, Navalny&#x27;s supporters slammed Yavlinsky. One of the most common complaints was that Yavlinsky had criticised a prisoner. In response to the avalanche of criticism, Yavlinsky published an article on 11 February entitled &quot;It is so simple to become executioners: Stay silent!&quot;, in which he explained why it was important at this particular moment in time to assess Navalny&#x27;s politics:This article is a conversation on what is happening right now, on the risks that are intensifying, on the future of our country and on what should be done to make Russia free, democratic and modern. Such a conversation is bound to affect Navalny who has been at the centre of public attention since August last year and has sought to be the leader, and not simply a politician. Accordingly, it goes without saying that his political position should be analysed and discussed.

Calling themselves the opposition, his activists keep repeating that the regime believes in its own propaganda and that this is its weak spot. However, now the same thing is also happening in the protest movement. People are starting to believe that Putin is shaking with fear after Navalny&#x27;s films and that he was afraid of the return of his opponent from Berlin. Well, this is nonsense! Today, however, a lot of people are paying a high price for this fantasy. In this situation, a politician cannot stay silent for the sake of psychological comfort, tact or tactics.Yavlinsky also noted that the ultimate goal of Navalny&#x27;s political plan was to organise the next &quot;smart voting&quot; campaign for the State Duma elections in autumn 2021. Yavlinsky termed this strategy a &quot;stupid and dangerous artifice&quot;:Since 2011, including thanks to Navalny&#x27;s artifice, calling on the electorate &quot;to vote for anyone, but United Russia&quot;, we have a Duma supporting unanimously Putin&#x27;s foreign policy adventures and desecration of the Constitution, rubber-stamping repressive laws and whipping up hysteria in the search for internal enemies and foreign agents.  And what will happen now? Navalny&#x27;s team will continue promoting this folly while we must &quot;tactfully&quot; stay silent, because Navalny has ended up in a prison colony? No, it doesn&#x27;t work like that: in a country that is rapidly becoming impoverished, the danger of national socialism is increasing, while the support of the Mironov-Prilepin party and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is the path leading directly to fascism.During the election campaign for the State Duma elections in autumn 2021 Navalny&#x27;s supporters conducted a wide-ranging campaign in support of &quot;smart voting&quot;, advocating that people vote, &quot;inter alia&quot;, for communists and representatives of the Mironov-Prilepin bloc. Such mass media as Echo Moskvy and the TV channel Rain also signed up to this campaign. As a result, the number of representatives of the Communist Party increased in the State Duma of the 8th convocation. Yavlinsky noted: &quot;The Communists have established a foothold as the ideological prop of the regime and will push even more state policy towards war …&quot;. Meanwhile, during the election campaign, Yavlinsky and the Yabloko Party called on the electorate to vote against the war, but this call was not heard. According to official data, 1.34% of the electorate voted for Yabloko. Yavlinsky believes that this happened in part owing to widespread involvement in the smart voting strategy: When President Putin effectively declared war against Ukraine last summer (2021) in his article – doctrine on the &quot;historical past&quot;, while the Minister of Defence was put at the top of the United Russia list, the propagandists-supporters of &quot;smart voting&quot; did not want to understand that this also represented a declaration of the regime on its intentions to start a war. At the time, the thoughts and imagination of many &quot;opinion leaders&quot; were preoccupied by the instructions that they had been issued on who to vote for, meaningless electoral calculations, and fantasy thinking on how &quot;smart voting&quot; would help the prisoner Navalny. Yabloko&#x27;s calls on people to oppose the war, in other words, not to vote for candidates from the parties benefiting from &quot;smart voting&quot;, which are the parties of war together with United Russia, were unfortunately not heard. And now in February 2022 our country is actually on the verge of war, which will, if it happens, become a major misfortune for Ukraine and a lethal national disaster for Russia (G. Yavlinsky &quot;With Putin and Populism&quot;. 10 February 2022)

== 2021 parliamentary elections ==
On 12 July 2021 Russian President Vladimir Putin published an article entitled &quot;On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians&quot;. In his article Putin threatened Ukraine and the entire Western world with war. On 19 July Yavlinsky published his reaction to Putin&#x27;s doctrine. In the article &quot;On the Historical Future of Russia and Ukraine&quot;, he castigated this position and warned against the existential threat of such a conflict for Russia and the whole world.&lt;...&gt; this article was a warning. Even though it was addressed not so much to us as to a notional version of the West, it was published on the eve of what we call elections in our country, and this makes Russian citizens its active recipients to a material extent. Russia&#x27;s citizens will have an opportunity to express their views on the policy proclaimed by the President. We can vote &quot;for&quot;: for Russia&#x27;s right to a significant proportion of the territories of neighbouring Ukraine, for a plan to strip Ukraine of its sovereignty and statehood, and accordingly for the opportunity to wage war with Ukraine at any moment in time. This means voting for United Russia, the Communist Party of Russia, the Liberal Democratic of Russia and A Just Russia – Patriots for Truth. However, we can also vote against such a policy – for peace, the prospects of mutual understanding with the European Union, for equal and amicable relations with Ukraine and Belarus. And this means voting for Yabloko. (G. Yavlinsky. &quot;On the Historical Future of Russia and Ukraine&quot;. 19 July 2021).

Yavlinsky did not stand in the elections to the State Duma of the 8th convocation. Instead, he participated proactively in the election campaign of the Yabloko Party, met with voters, called on people to vote for the party and its representatives in numerous election interviews. In his speeches Yavlinsky spoke constantly about the threat of war with Ukraine, stressing that at this time only this issue determined Russia&#x27;s future. Voting in the State Duma elections in autumn 2021 was in his opinion a plebiscite on people&#x27;s attitudes to war. Yabloko was the only political party to speak out against the impending war with Ukraine in these elections. However, the anti-war calls of Yavlinsky and Yabloko were not supported in the opposition mass media and protest movement in Russia, which deployed a large-scale campaign in support of &quot;smart voting&quot;, calling on the electorate to vote for the Communists and other advocate of repressions, national policy and the war with Ukraine.

According to official data, 1.34% of the electorate voted at the State Duma elections in September 2021 for the Yabloko Party. Five months after the elections, the State Duma of the 8th convocation voted unanimously for the ratification of friendship treaties between the Russian Federation and districts of East Ukraine which declared its sovereignty unilaterally (the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and the Lugansk People&#x27;s Republic). Two days later Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine.  

After the elections, which resulted in an increase in the number of Communist deputies in the State Duma, Yavlinsky stated that the supporters and advocates of Smart Voting would be responsible for any future actions of the State Duma deputies supported by Smart Voting. He also stated that the Russian regime perceived the widespread voting for Communists as a signal on the admissibility of intensifying repressions and on the need to consolidate Russia&#x27;s imperialist policy. The Kremlin also interpreted the refusal of society to support the anti-war calls of Yabloko to mean to all intents and purposes support for a policy of war.

== On the invasion of Ukraine (2022–23) ==
On 24 January 2022, when the situation on the border with Ukraine deteriorated, Yavlinsky and the Yabloko Party published a statement, warning that &quot;in the case of Russia the war will have irreversible destructive consequences&quot;, while &quot;the political outcome will be the collapse of the Russian state and national disaster.&quot; On 27 January Yavlinsky presented an action plan to Russia&#x27;s leadership, which would prevent military confrontation with Ukraine and the West, and proposed that the Yabloko Party act as the mediator in an international negotiating process as preparations for direct negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

On 24 February 2022, after the launch of the Russian invasion into Ukraine, the Federal Political Committee of the Yabloko Party published the following statement signed by Yavlinsky:Yabloko expresses its categorical protest against the military actions against Ukraine. This war is a war being waged by Russia against the objective march of history, a war against time, and a tragic disconnect from the reality of the modern world.

The consequences of this war will be with us for a long time. Today, however, we are talking first and foremost about a tragedy, the sufferings and destruction of people, something that can never be corrected. The tragedy is due to the lies, brutality and absolute indifference of the Russian regime to people.

The Yabloko Party believes the war with Ukraine to be the gravest crime.

We believe that this war is contrary to Russia&#x27;s national interests and destroys Russia&#x27;s future.Yavlinsky and Yabloko also offer all the capabilities, resources and knowledge of the party for the practical creation of a special humanitarian corridor for the exchange of prisoners and the dead in Ukraine. The Party sent corresponding appeals to the Russian and international structures, &quot;inter alia&quot;, to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

In public speeches, Yavlinsky has been calling for an immediate ceasefire agreement, the exchange of prisoners and the bodies of the dead and the start of peaceful negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and has offered to participate in person in negotiations on the exchange of prisoners and the bodies of the dead.

On 4 February 2023 Novaya Gazeta published an article by Grigory Yavlinsky on the front page of its weekly issue entitled &quot;Just Stop!&quot; where he called for a cease fire in the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. The article was translated into English on 9 February 2023 and published in the American magazine The Nation, entitled Stop the Killing: A cease-fire agreement is not a treaty; it is not about peace, and not even about a truce or large-scale dialogue. It is a political demand aimed at saving lives. That&#x27;s the main thing today.

A cease-fire agreement is the very first step toward a settlement. As long as there is fighting and people are dying, no attempts at discussion or negotiation are meaningful. Therefore, under the circumstances, a cease-fire agreement is required to make way for any positive development.

A cease fire is a political demand, the realization of which depends entirely on the willingness and understanding of the people making the decisions.Previously, another American weekly Newsweek issued on 7 February 2023 a similar review of Yavlinsky&#x27;s article in its material Putin Opponent Calls for Ukraine Ceasefire to Stop Bloodshed. The article was accompanied by quotes from an interview with Yavlinsky in the publication:The situation is such that it would have never any kind of end because there is no possibility for any victory from both sides, so it&#x27;s endless. Ukraine has achieved a lot and paid the price for that already, and now it&#x27;s such a situation that the continuation of the war can destroy all this because the devastation would be enormous.In Yavlinsky&#x27;s opinion, such an agreement could only be concluded if it had the backing of the leadership of Russia, Ukraine, the US, the European Union and NATO.

On 1 July 2023 Grigory Yavlinsky publicised seven key talking points on a cease fire in Ukraine. Live on the YouTube channel Zhivoy Gvozd, Yavlinsky commented in detail on each point and called on the media and others to start working on informing the public that a cease-fire agreement must be concluded as the only possible path to peace:It is vital that the cease-fire proposal enjoy the broadest possible public support. That is why we must constantly talk about this issue and try to persuade people to come round to this point of view.

In the case of both Russia and Ukraine, the existence of these countries in the 21st century is contingent on a ceasefire enacted as soon as possible, for the issue today is whether these people will have a future. This is a fundamental security issue for all of Europe, and possibly for the world as a whole.The seven talking points were published on Grigory Yavlinsky&#x27;s official website and disseminated in social networks. The talking points were also translated into English and posted on the politician&#x27;s English-language website.

Some observers considered Yavlinsky to be a likely presidential candidate in 2024, considering him to be the only remaining noteworthy politician opposed to the war with Ukraine to have neither been killed nor imprisoned. Yavlinsky ultimately declined to participate in the election in late December 2023.

==Personal life==
Yavlinsky met his wife, Yelena, while studying at the Plekhanov Institute, and the couple have two children. Their son Mikhail was born in 1971 and currently works for the BBC Russian Service in London. Their other son, Aleksey, was born in 1981 and works as a computer programmer in Moscow.

A 2011 interview revealed that political opponents of Yavlinsky&#x27;s had his 23-year-old piano-playing son kidnapped in 1994, and his fingers cut off and mailed to him. He declined to reveal who was behind the attack and their demands, but said he &quot;did everything to ensure the safety of his children&quot;.

<text>The Sandia Mountains (Southern Tiwa: Posu gai hoo-oo, Keres: Tsepe,&quot; [[Navajo language|Navajo]]: Dził Nááyisí; [[Tewa language|Tewa]]: O:ku:p’į, [[Taos language|Northern Tiwa]]: Kep’íanenemą; [[Jemez language|Towa]]: Kiutawe, [[Zuni language|Zuni]]: Chibiya Yalanne&quot;) are a mountain range located in Bernalillo and Sandoval counties, immediately to the east of the city of Albuquerque in New Mexico in the southwestern United States. The mountains are just due south of the southern terminus of the Rocky Mountains, and are part of the Sandia–Manzano Mountains. This is largely within the Cibola National Forest and protected as the Sandia Mountain Wilderness. The highest point is Sandia Crest, AMSL.

==Etymology==

&quot;Sandía&quot; means &quot;watermelon&quot; in Spanish, and is popularly believed to be a reference to the reddish color of the mountains at sunset. Also, when viewed from the west, the profile of the mountains is a long ridge, with a thin zone of green conifers near the top, suggesting the &quot;rind&quot; of the watermelon. However, as Robert Julyan notes, &quot;the most likely explanation is the one believed by the Sandia Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash gourds growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo.&quot;

In Southern Tiwa, &quot;Posu gai hoo-oo&quot; means &quot;where water slides down arroyo&quot;. Sandia Pueblo Indians, who are Tiwa speakers, sometimes call the mountain &quot;Bien Mur&quot;, &quot;big mountain&quot;. In Tewa, &quot;O:ku:p’į means&quot; turtle mountain &quot;(oku, turtle; p’į, mountain).&quot; The Sandias are mentioned in pueblo mythology as a sacred mountain of the South of the Tewa&quot;.&quot;

==Layout and neighboring ranges==
The Sandias are a small range, a part of the Basin and Range Province, but built by a different phenomenon known as rifting, consisting of a single north–south ridge, which rises to two major summits: Sandia Crest and South Sandia Peak, . The range measures approximately north-south, and the width in the east–west direction varies from . The west side of the range is steep and rugged, with a number of sheer rock walls and towers near Sandia Crest. The east side has a gentler slope.

The Sandias are part of a single larger geologic unit, the Sandia–Manzano Mountains, which consists of two other parts: the Manzanita Mountains and the Manzano Mountains (both of which lie to the south of the Sandias). The Sandia mountains are separated from the Manzano mountains by the Manzanitas. One of the notable features in the Sandia mountains is Tijeras Canyon which leads to a historically important pass; the canyon is traversed by Interstate 40, following the route of historic U.S. Route 66.

The Sandias are the highest range in the immediate vicinity, and are well-separated from the higher Sangre de Cristo Mountains. This gives Sandia Crest a relatively high topographic prominence of . Lying to the east and northeast of the Sandias are two smaller ranges, the Ortiz Mountains and the San Pedro Mountains.

The Sandia Mountains are home to the world&#x27;s second longest tramway, Sandia Peak Tramway, which is long. Over this distance the tram cars ascend over . The average speed of the tram car is , and the length of the ride is approximately 15 minutes.

==Climate==
==Geology==
The Sandia Mountains are a fault block range, on the eastern edge of the Rio Grande Rift Valley. The Sandias were uplifted in the last ten million years as part of the formation of the Rio Grande Rift. They form the eastern boundary of the Albuquerque Basin. The core of the range consists of Sandia granite, with a U-Pb age of 1453±12 million years. There is also some metamorphic rock of age 1.60 billion years. This is topped by a relatively thin layer (approximately of sedimentary rock (mostly limestone, and some sandstone) of Pennsylvanian age (circa 300 million years ago). The limestone contains marine fossils including crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods, horn corals, and bryozoans. However, most of the fossils are too small for the human eye to detect. Potassium-feldspar (K-spar) crystals embedded within the Sandia granite give the mountains their distinct pink color.

==Ecology==

Entirely located within the Arizona/New Mexico Mountains ecoregion, per the Bailey&#x27;s Ecoregions (US Forest Service) and the EPA Ecoregions systems, the Sandia Mountains vary much in land form, climate and species. Affinities with interior chaparral occur on lower elevations of the western slopes, while the crest and upper elevations of both slopes have affinities with the Rocky Mountains to the north.

The Sandia Mountains also encompass four different named life zones from the base to the top, due to the large changes in elevation, temperature, and precipitation. The desert grassland and savanna at the western base of the mountains (near the eastern edge of the City of Albuquerque, east of about Juan Tabo Boulevard) is part of the &quot;Upper Sonoran Zone.&quot; From on the milder climate western slopes of the Sandia Mountains on mostly granitic bedrock, the Upper Sonoran Zone is found. A juniper savanna mixes with desert grassland in lower elevations, while slightly higher a mixed Piñon-Juniper-Oak zone expands outward and upward from arroyos, including a thin cover of grasses such as black grama (&quot;Bouteloua eriopoda&quot;), sideoats grama (&quot;Bouteloua curtipendula&quot;), and blue grama (&quot;Bouteloua gracilis&quot;). Broadleaf evergreen shrubs and dwarfed trees are common including shrub live oak (&quot;Quercus turbinella&quot;), gray oak (&quot;Quercus grisea&quot;), and hairy mountain mahogany (&quot;Cercocarpus breviflorus&quot;). Rosette succulents include beargrass (&quot;Nolina greenei&quot;), banana yucca (&quot;Yucca baccata&quot;), Navajo yucca (&quot;Yucca baileyi&quot;), and various cacti. Deciduous shrubs include threeleaf sumac (&quot;Rhus trilobata&quot;) and wafer ash (&quot;Ptelea trifoliata&quot;). Some plants of Chihuahuan Desert affinities are found in this area, including oreganillo (&quot;Aloysia wrightii&quot;), mariola (&quot;Parthenium incanum&quot;), desert marigold (&quot;Baileya&quot; spp.), and a few subspecies of the often-numerous Engelmann prickly pear (&quot;Opuntia engelmannii&quot;).

From , in the &quot;Transition Zone&quot;, Ponderosa Pine dominates, and evergreen oaks change to more cold-tolerant deciduous oaks. From , a mixture of conifers occurs in the &quot;Canadian Zone&quot;; Gambel oak (&quot;Quercus gambelii&quot;) is at its upper natural range in this zone. Finally, from to the Sandia Crest at , mostly on the eastern slopes, Engelmann spruce and white fir dominate the &quot;Hudsonian Zone.&quot;

On the eastern slopes of the Sandia Mountains, the life zones respond to a cooler climate than the western slopes, plus mostly limestone bedrock. Broadleaf evergreen plants, some succulents, and those with Chihuahuan Desert affinities are mostly absent, though other characteristics correspond to the same life zones on the western slope, except at slightly lower elevations. In the east slope&#x27;s portion of the Upper Sonoran and Transition zones, alligator juniper (&quot;Juniperus deppeana&quot;) occurs, absent on the western slopes.

All zone boundary elevations are approximate, depending on microclimate or aspect of the land.

==Access and recreation==
One can reach the top of the Sandias via two easy ways. The Sandia Peak Tramway ascends from the west side to a point on the crestline about south of Sandia Crest, at the top of the Sandia Peak Ski Area, which is located on the east side of the mountains. A road (NM 536) from the east provides access to the bottom of the ski area and also to the Sandia Crest itself, where there is a gift shop, restaurant, scenic overlook, and a large electronic communication site with numerous towers and antennas.
The Sandia Crest Scenic Byway is also a popular path for motorcycle riders with its miles of winding road to the summit.

The Sandia Mountains are the most visited range in New Mexico. Numerous hiking trails exist on both sides of the range, such as the popular La Luz Trail and Crest Trail. Much of the west side of the range is included in the Sandia Mountain Wilderness; the trails on that side are steeper, and water is very scarce. Numerous picnic and recreation sites can be found on NM 536. These sites, along with some sites on the west face of the Sandias, require a $3 daily use/parking permit as part of the National Fee Program. No developed campgrounds currently exist in the Sandias.

The rock walls and pinnacles on the west side of the range provide abundant rock climbing opportunities, from bouldering and top-roping to multi-day big wall climbs on the Shield, the largest rock feature on the mountain. However, the long hikes (often off-trail) required to reach many of the climbs, and the variable quality of rock (often poor), prevent the Sandias from being a major climbing destination.

Both Sandia Peak and Sandia Crest are popular launching sites for recreational hang gliding due to the sheer drop-offs to the west. Launches at the Peak occur throughout the summer.

Walking the entire spine of the Sandia Mountains is possible, a 26-mile hike with over 4,000 feet in elevation gain.

=== Incidents ===
Hikers and climbers are urged to use caution when visiting the Sandias, where fatal accidents are not unknown and search and rescue operations are commonplace.

* In 1996, three climbers, Carlos Abad, Jane Tennessen and Glen Tietgen died after they fell 816 feet while ascending Warpy Moople, a climb up Muralla Grande in the Sandias.
* In 2015, the Sandias reported four deaths. 17 year-old Maya Spencer slipped on ice and fell to her death off a cliff in March, and 24-year old Brittany Johnson was fatally injured near the park&#x27;s parking lot in May. In September, 40-year old hiker Bryan Conkling was found dead while becoming lost on La Luz trail. Later that month, a 70-year old man died when going missing while hiking.
* In 2016, 26-year old hiker Deidre Tafoya fell over 40 feet off a cliff while hiking in the Sandias with family. She was fatally injured.
* In 2020, 40-year old hiker Gilbran Hernandez-Avila was found dead after failing to return while hiking in the Sandia Mountains. In 2021, 20-year old hiker Brandon Foster was found dead after accidentally straying from the La Luz trail.
* In 2019, experienced climber Garon Coriz was fatally injured when he fell over 50 meters while rappelling in the Sandia Mountains.
* In 2024, three hikers were seriously injured by a falling boulder while hiking the Embudo Canyon Trailhead.

==History==
The Sandias contain a location notable for prehistoric archaeology: the &quot;Sandia Cave&quot; was believed by some in the 1930s to the 1950s to have been inhabited 10000 to 12000 years ago by the &quot;Sandia Man,&quot; a cultural classification that is no longer used. The cave can be accessed via a 1/2 mile trail in Las Huertas Canyon, on the northeast side of the range, near Placitas, New Mexico.

Ancestral and early Pueblo peoples have lived in the Sandia Mountains area for thousands of years. Examples of previous Pueblo settlements, now unoccupied, include Tijeras Pueblo and Pa&#x27;ako Pueblo, both founded around 700 years ago. Sandia Pueblo is a modern pueblo, abutting the Sandia Mountains on the northwest side of the range. Some of the foothills of the range are on Sandia Pueblo land; there have been disputes in the past between the Pueblo, the Forest Service, and private landowners over rights to various parts of the range. The people of Sandia Pueblo consider the mountains a sacred place.

In 1970, the hippie community of Tawapa was established near the Sandia Mountains. However, in the 1990s Tawapa ceased to exist.

<text>The Weimar Coalition () is the name given to the coalition government formed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Catholic Centre Party (Z), who together had a large majority of the delegates to the Constituent Assembly that met at Weimar in 1919, and were the principal groups that designed the constitution of the Weimar Republic. These three parties were seen as the most committed to Germany&#x27;s new democratic system, and together governed Germany until the elections of 1920, when the first elections under the new constitution were held, and both the SPD and especially the DDP lost a considerable share of their votes. Although the Coalition was revived in the ministry of Joseph Wirth from 1921 to 1922, the pro-democratic elements never truly had a majority in the Reichstag from this point on, and the situation gradually grew worse for them with the continued weakening of the DDP. This meant that any pro-republican group that hoped to attain a majority would need to form a &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; with the conservative-liberal German People&#x27;s Party (DVP), which only gradually moved from monarchism to republicanism over the course of the Weimar Republic and was virtually wiped out politically after the death of their most prominent figure, Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann in 1929.

Nevertheless, the coalition remained at least theoretically important as the parties most supportive of republican government in Germany, and continued to act in coalition in the government of the Free State of Prussia (by far Germany&#x27;s largest constituent state both by population and by area) and other states until as late as 1932. In the second round of voting in the 1925 presidential election, the Weimar Coalition parties all supported the candidacy of the Centrist former chancellor Wilhelm Marx, who was narrowly defeated by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, supported by a centre-right coalition of the DVP, the German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), and the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party (BVP). The fact that the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) decided to run their candidate Ernst Thälmann in the second round was widely seen as a spoiler candidate who in effect threw the election to Hindenburg. Both the Comintern and East German historiography later criticized this action by the KPD-leadership as a mistake.

After World War II, the reconstituted SPD and the &quot;de facto&quot; successor of the Centre Party (the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) (within Bavaria the BVP was &quot;de facto&quot; succeeded by the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU) which together formed the centre-right &quot;Union&quot;) and the DDP&#x27;s and DVP&#x27;s joint &quot;de facto&quot; successor (Free Democratic Party) formed the main political basis of the democratic Bundestag of West Germany.

== History ==

During the era of the German Empire, before the German Revolution of 1918–1919, politicians of the Centre Party and Social Democratic Party as well as the left liberals who would later form the German Democratic Party had cooperated when they censured Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg in 1913 for his handling of the Zabern Affair and then later in 1917 with their support of the Reichstag peace resolution which called for a peace with no annexations. To coordinate their cooperation they also formed an inter-party committee () that included members of all three parliamentary groups. The three parties had to deal with opposition from the right from 1912 on even though in the course of the war the SPD split with far left-groups like the Spartacus League that were fundamentally opposed not just to the war but to all attempts at working within the political system of the Empire. The right wing, through the stab in the back myth, would later pin the blame for Germany&#x27;s loss in the war on the alleged &quot;defeatist&quot; parties of the Weimar Coalition and cited the peace resolution as well as the willingness of politicians like Friedrich Ebert (SPD) to take power after the collapse of the Empire. They also blamed the Weimar Coalition-backed government for signing the Treaty of Versailles after it had lodged no more than an ineffectual complaint.

The elections of 6 June 1920 resulted in severe decline in the Coalition&#x27;s parliamentary strength, despite hopes that the dramatic failure of the right-wing Kapp Putsch would lessen the political reorientation of the Reichstag parties. The SPD received 21.7% of the vote, a significant drop from the 37.9% it had in January 1919. The DDP suffered the greatest loss, dropping from 18.5% to 8.4%. The Centre Party received 13.6% of the vote, only a slight decline from the 15.1% it had previously held. The swing shows the fundamental problem the Weimar Coalition parties faced throughout the Weimar Republic. The SPD lost most of its vote share to the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany, a left wing splinter faction opposed to any cooperation between leftist and &quot;bourgeois&quot; parties while the democratic center-right parties lost to the monarchist and revanchist right wing parties which capitalized on the widespread outrage at the Treaty of Versailles. Politics of pragmatism, comprise and moderation as espoused by the parties of the Weimar Coalition thus always faced attacks from strong anti-compromise forces on both the left and the right, which by 1930 formed a strong and growing share of the Reichstag, now mostly composed of the Communist Party of Germany and the Nazi Party, with the former rejecting any popular front-style cooperation due to the social fascism thesis. The communists and to a lesser extent the Nazis particularly attacked the Heinrich Brüning government in office 1930–1932 due to the austerity measures it enacted. Given that the communists rejected any cooperation with the Social Democratic Party, the SPD backed Brüning in any motion of no confidence initiated against him by Nazis and/or communists in hope of preventing an even more right wing government.

== Heritage ==

The social-liberal coalition (SPD-FDP), the grand coalition (Union-SPD), the rightcentrist Jamaica coalition (CDU/CSU-FDP-Greens) and the leftcentrist traffic light coalition (SPD-FDP-Alliance 90/The Greens) all share some aspects of the Weimar Coalition in that they include parties both left and right of center committed to liberal democracy. The CDU/CSU is primarily the &quot;inheritor&quot; of centrist Christian democracy and Bavarian regionalism, even if that influence has diminished in recent decades. FDP has at times represented leftcentrist social liberalism (like the old DDP) but is now mostly known for DVP reminding economic liberalism, conservative liberalism and positioned more to rightliberal party. Meanwhile The Greens combine green politics, cultural liberalism and more DDP reminding leftcentrist social liberalism and has formally inherited DDP&#x27;s position in the political spectrum.

<doc id="613446" wikidata="Q1395289" url="?curid=613446" title="Sam Roberts (singer-songwriter)">
<text>Sam Roberts (born October 2, 1974) is a Canadian rock singer-songwriter who has released seven 
albums. His debut EP &quot;The Inhuman Condition&quot;, reached the Canadian charts in 2002. He and his bandmates have released three albums as Sam Roberts and four albums as Sam Roberts Band. He is also a member of the Canadian group Anyway Gang, who released their debut self-titled album in 2019. Roberts has been nominated, together with his band, for fifteen Juno Awards, winning six, including Artist of the Year twice (2004 and 2009) and Album of the Year once (2004).

==Early life and Northstar==
Born in Westmount, to South African immigrants who had arrived in Montreal three weeks earlier, Roberts grew up on Cedar Avenue in Pointe-Claire, where his family moved to when he was five years old. Roberts is an alumnus of St. Edmund Elementary School, Beaconsfield; Loyola High School, N.D.G.; John Abbott College, Ste. Anne de Bellevue; and McGill University. He holds a BA in English from McGill University, graduating in 1998. Roberts&#x27; first band was William in 1993, that changed into Northstar in 1998. As William they put out a single, &quot;Piranha EP&quot; on Northern Assembly Records in 1996, while as Northstar they released a self-titled independent EP in 1998, but broke up in 1999.

== As &quot;Sam Roberts&quot; (2002–2010) ==
After disbanding Northstar, Roberts recorded a twelve track demo, &quot;Brother Down&quot;, which formed the basis for the EP, &quot;The Inhuman Condition&quot; released in 2002. Recorded with Jordon Zadorozny, Roberts &quot;recorded a song a day&quot;. Roberts signed with artist manager Dave Spencer and began to perform live. With the assistance of Linda Bush at Universal Music Publishing Canada, he signed a publishing contract with UMPG and a record contract with MapleMusic Recordings. MapleMusic released the six track EP culled from the demo with Roberts noting that &quot;it is not something I had intended to be my first real foray into the music world but I couldn&#x27;t turn my back on such a chance&quot;. It included two breakthrough singles, &quot;Brother Down&quot; (released in mid-2002) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Walk Away Eileen&quot; (released in late 2002) which were heavily promoted in the Canadian market.

In August 2002, Roberts signed with Universal Music. In November 2002, Roberts won the CASBY Award for &quot;Favourite New Artist&quot;. In 2003, he released his major label debut album, &quot;We Were Born in a Flame&quot;, with the singles &quot;Where Have All the Good People Gone?&quot; and &quot;Hard Road&quot; garnering success in the Canadian market. The album achieved double platinum sales status in Canada and won two Juno Awards in 2004: Album of the Year and Rock Album of the Year, with Roberts winning the Juno award for Artist of the Year.
Roberts’ second album, &quot;Chemical City&quot;, was released in April 2006, with the first single &quot;The Gate&quot; topping as a No. 1 hit on Canadian radio. The second single, &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;, won the Juno Award for Video of the Year in 2007 and the album achieved platinum sales status.

Roberts&#x27; third album, &quot;Love at the End of the World&quot;, released in May 2008, debuted at No. 1 on the Canadian album chart, a first for Roberts. The lead single, &quot;Them Kids&quot;, debuted on iTunes on March 4, 2008. Roberts again won the Juno award for Artist of the Year and the album took home Rock Album of the Year and reached gold sales status.

== As Sam Roberts Band (2011–present) ==
Roberts released his fourth studio album, &quot;Collider&quot;, on May 10, 2011. It is the first album under the moniker &quot;Sam Roberts Band&quot; instead of &quot;Sam Roberts&quot;. The first single, &quot;I Feel You&quot; was officially released to Canadian radio on February 28, with an iTunes Canada release of March 8.

On November 20, 2013, Roberts announced the release of next album, &quot;Lo-Fantasy&quot;, which was released by Paper Bag Records on February 11, 2014. Sam Roberts&#x27; Band released the &quot;Counting the Days&quot; EP on April 18, 2015. In 2015, the band collaborated with Toronto&#x27;s Spearhead Brewery to release the &quot;Sam Roberts Band Session Ale&quot;.

Their sixth studio album, &quot;Terraform&quot;, was released October 28, 2016. On September 12, 2016, a North-American tour was announced to promote their new album. &quot;Terraform&quot; was later nominated for a 2017 Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year, losing to The Tragically Hip&#x27;s &quot;Man Machine Poem&quot;.

The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;All of Us&quot;, was released worldwide on October 16, 2020, on Secret Weapon / Known Accomplice.

On October 20, 2023, Sam Roberts Band released their new album &quot;The Adventures Of Ben Blank&quot;, featuring the tracks &quot;Picture Of Love&quot; and &quot;I Dream Of You&quot;.

<doc id="613449" wikidata="Q5234527" url="?curid=613449" title="Hickman High School">
<text>David Henry Hickman High School (commonly Hickman or HHS) is a public secondary school in Columbia, Missouri, United States, serving students in grades 9–12. Built in 1927, it is the oldest of four high schools in the Columbia Public Schools, with admission based primarily on the locations of students&#x27; homes. Hickman is also one of the largest high schools in Missouri and has perennially strong academic, athletic, and arts programs.

There are a number of notable alumni from Hickman including a Missouri Governor, several U.S. and State members of congress, Frederick Chapman Robbins (who won the 1954 Nobel Prize for medicine), Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, and Kenneth Lay (founder and former CEO of the now-bankrupt Enron Corporation). Hickman is a two-time Blue Ribbon School and a Missouri Gold Star School.

In 2022, Hickman had nineteen National Merit Finalists, the most of any school in Missouri. Hickman has more than double the number of Presidential Scholars than any other public or private high school in Missouri.

Hickman was constructed in 1927 on the country estate of Missouri legislator and educator David Henry Hickman, next to what was then U.S. Route 40. The school was built to replace the earlier Columbia High School and carried over many of its traditions including the mascot and yearbook. Today, the school is accredited with distinction by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as well as the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. Hickman&#x27;s mascot is the Kewpie.

==History==
Public secondary education began in Columbia during the 1880s with the founding of Columbia High School in 1889 at the intersection of Eighth Street and Rogers.

As many high schools were at this point in history, CHS offered a two-year course of study. In 1895, it was increased to three, and again in 1896 to four. Extracurricular activities in 1898 included a literary society, choral union, orchestra, and debate team. Sports teams were present, but were not yet funded by the district. Overcrowding caused the demolition of the old school and the construction of a new three-story structure at the same site. The new building included the district&#x27;s first gymnasium, and the first athletics and music teacher were hired.

1912 saw the first edition of the school yearbook, the Cresset. The school mascot, the Kewpie, appeared for the first time in the Cresset associated with the basketball team &quot;...whose loyalty to the school and to the Kewpie motto, ‘Keep Smiling,’ has won the State Championship&quot;. During World War I, students were excused to work as part of the war effort, and the German Club was removed from the extracurricular offerings.

In the 1920s, Columbia was experiencing continued growth, and the district decided to build a new high school on the edge of town on the newly built U.S. Route 40. David Henry Hickman donated part of his estate which had formerly held grandstands and a track for horse racing. David H. Hickman High School opened in 1927, and the old high school became Jefferson Junior High School, which later became Jefferson Middle School. The Great Depression of the 1930s caused the school district to operate with a deficit for the first time; however, the high school building was expanded using loans and the Works Progress Administration.

In this decade, the school&#x27;s wrestlers captured three state championships, and Hickman created a marching band. The 1940s and World War II brought a new level of international awareness to Hickman, and classes in international relations, aeronautics, and home nursing were added. In 1944, the operetta &quot;Tune In&quot; was performed, and there have been yearly musical productions since. In 1948, the tradition of requiring sophomores to wear beanies was restored.

The 1950s saw the end of racial segregation in Columbia, and Hickman was integrated with Fredrick Douglas High School. The influx of students saw a building boom, and class rooms for special education, adult classes, vocational work, and laboratories were built. A new gymnasium was built in 1955 and a swimming pool added in 1968.

In 1961, the tradition of sophomore beanies was ended. David Wheeler became Hickman&#x27;s first presidential scholar in 1964, the first year of the program. Hickman saw four state championships in three sports in the 1960s. Rock Bridge High School was opened in 1973 as the second high school in Columbia, and competitive women&#x27;s sports were offered for the first time 1970s. The 1980s saw much national recognition; Hickman was given the Blue Ribbon Award for 1984–85.

President Ronald Reagan visited the school in 1987, and Hickman filled Missouri&#x27;s quota of Presidential Scholars in 1988. In 1994–95, Hickman was once again given the Blue Ribbon Award, and four additional Presidential Scholars were named in the decade; Hickman now had a total of 12 Presidential Scholars, more than any public school in Missouri. 1994 was also the year that Hickman beat Rock Bridge 43-42 in triple overtime in what some called the Game of the Century as crosstown rivals met for only the second time in history, and their first football matchup since 1981. Nearly 10,000 spectators witnessed the 10/21/94 event despite an official capacity of about 2,500. Computer labs were created in the late 1980s, and the Columbia Aeronautics Space Association (CASA), a realistic space simulation program, was founded. In the 1990s, Hickman won state championships in baseball, women&#x27;s swimming, men&#x27;s track, men&#x27;s cross country, and men&#x27;s tennis.

2001 saw a presidential scholar each of the first four years and the development of a master plan for Hickman&#x27;s campus. A bond-issue was passed, and the renovations repairing the oldest parts of the school occurred. A large commons space, a main office, and language labs were added in 2003. In 2005, the oldest part of the building including the auditorium was restored, and the remainder of the school air-conditioned. State championships in football, baseball, and track were won in 2005.

===1987 Presidential visit===
On March 26, 1987, President Ronald Reagan made a special trip to Columbia, Missouri to speak at the National Governors&#x27; Association-Department of Education Conference as well as Fairview Elementary and David H. Hickman High School. Hickman had received the Department of Education&#x27;s &quot;Secondary School Recognition Award&quot;, and with six students having been named Presidential Scholars since 1964, Hickman ranked in the top five percent of the nation&#x27;s schools. In his address to the assembled students and faculty at Hickman, President Reagan praised the school&#x27;s academic quality, saying, in part, &quot;If America is to be what it should be in the 21st century, then it&#x27;s going to need a lot of schools, good schools. And Hickman, I&#x27;m pleased and proud to tell you, is one of the best.&quot; During the presentation, President Reagan was made an honorary Kewpie and given a school sweatshirt as a gift.

==Academics==
Hickman is known for excellent academic programs. The school has had more Presidential Scholars named than any other public high school in the State of Missouri. A 2006 article in &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;What makes a high school great&quot;, listed Hickman within the top 5% of high schools in the nation.

In 2007, the school won the Siemens Foundation and College Board Award for Advanced Placement, meaning that Hickman leads the nation in AP participation and performance. Its literary journal, the &quot;Hickman Review&quot;, has received several prestigious national awards. Hickman was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School for 1984–85 and 1994–95.

==Campus==

Hickman High School was built on U.S. Route 40 on the country estate of David H. Hickman in 1927. The school has since expanded dramatically in size from its original two-story structure.

Today, the campus is bordered by Interstate 70 Business Loop, Seventh Street, Wilkes Boulevard, and Providence Road. A major addition in 1956 doubled the size of the school adding classrooms, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool. The 1970s saw the construction of a Fine Arts Building and a continuation of classroom additions.

In 2003, a commons area, office space, and language labs were added, and in 2005, the remainder of the school was air-conditioned and remodeled to match the original architecture.

The Hickman Campus is host to several events throughout the year including the Missouri All-State Band Auditions.

==Extracurricular activities==
===Fine arts===
The Hickman High School Marching Band is one element of a comprehensive band program. The marching band begins practicing in July with summer music rehearsals and concludes its season with the end of the football season. The marching band comprises 105 students enrolled in band classes at Hickman High School as well as several Hickman students that are members of the color guard. As the marching band &quot;activity&quot; continues to evolve, the Hickman band remains active as it consistently participates in performances at home football games, local parades, and region-wide marching festivals. Throughout its recent history of participation in marching band festivals, the band has been a consistent finalist and has been awarded outstanding caption recognition in all captions, including Outstanding Musical Performance, Outstanding Visual Performance, Outstanding Percussion, Outstanding Color Guard, Outstanding Drum Majors, and Outstanding Soloist. Most recently, the band placed 2nd in the Gold (top) division at the Ozarko Marching Festival and placed 10th out of 48 bands at the Greater St. Louis Marching Festival. The Hickman Marching Band has traveled to Florida and most recently to Honolulu, Hawaii (June, 2005) as they presented performances in the King Kamehameha Parade and a special performance at the Memorial. The band repeated this trip in June 2008 and in June 2011.

The Hickman High School Concert Band Program currently consists of Wind Ensemble (1st hour) and Concert Band (2nd hour). Each year, the Wind Ensemble (membership by individual audition) and the Concert Band present many performances for the community including home concerts and special events; in addition, the combined bands participate in the State Large Ensemble Festival and consistently receive Superior ratings. The Hickman High School Wind Ensemble has been selected to perform for the Missouri Music Educators Association three times(2001, 2005, and 2022).
The Hickman High School Jazz Program is an extracurricular activity available to student enrolled in Hickman band classes. The jazz program comprises two &quot;big bands&quot; of standard jazz instrumentation as well as various jazz combos. The jazz bands begin morning rehearsals at the conclusion of the marching band season and continue throughout the school year. Both jazz bands present 2 concerts per year, as well as participating in 3–4 jazz festivals per year.

The Hickman High School string orchestra is composed of the finest string players in the school and meets 1st hour. The band and string programs complement each other, combining into a full orchestra for major works such as Carmina Burana, Verdi&#x27;s Requiem, and tribute concerts for composers such as Leonard Bernstein. In 2007, the orchestra traveled to San Antonio, Texas to perform at the Heritage Music Festival. They received 3 first-place awards.

Choral Music at Hickman has been a part of the total education experience since the first choral music class was included in the curriculum of Columbia High School for the 1899–1900 school year. Since then, choirs at Hickman have received numerous accolades and awards for excellence in choral performance at state, regional, national, and international festivals. These include a first-place finish at the International Youth and Music festival, Vienna, Austria, a performance with the internationally renowned Canadian Brass, a performance with former Missouri Governor, Senator, and U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, and performances at state and regional music educator conferences. Hickman choirs have toured extensively throughout Europe, visiting Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, England, and most recently, Italy and the Vatican. Notable performances include: Salzburger Dom in Salzburg, Austria; Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal, Canada; the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.; St. Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice, Italy; St. Francis Basilica in Assisi, Italy; and St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican City.

Musical theatre has been a staple of Hickman High School for decades, having produced All-School musicals as far back as the 1940s. The musical productions class first appeared with the Victor Herbert musical &quot;The Red Mill&quot;, which opened as it had in 1946 when Hickman first produced it. Since that time, Musical Productions has grown into a graduated program, with three levels of study. Each course is designed to improve the student&#x27;s skill level and grow students into confident and well-rounded performers.

===Athletics===

The Hickman Kewpie football team won the Class 6 MSHSAA title in fall 2004. Wrestler Tony Pescaglia won a state title in 2005 and 2006. His brother, K. C. Pescaglia, won a wrestling state title in 2006 and 2007. The baseball team won the Class 4 state title in spring 2005. Tim Cornell won the 1600-meter (mile) state championships in 2004 and 2005 in track and field. Cornell also won the 2003 and 2004 cross-country state championships.

Football at Columbia High School, Hickman&#x27;s predecessor, started in 1894. With the exception of the Spanish influenza epidemic of 1918, it appears football has been played every year at Columbia Hickman High School since that initial 1894 year.

The Hickman-Rock Bridge series is now called the Providence Bowl in reference to Providence Road, a major north–south street in Columbia that connects the two schools. The Providence Bowl meeting had taken place at the University of Missouri&#x27;s Faurot Field at Memorial Stadium from 2004 to 2012, but due to scheduling issues, will be played at Hickman this year.

Hickman from 1981 has a 10–7 series edge over Rock Bridge with a series record victory in 2000 by the score of 55–0. In 2012, due to the new MSHSAA playoff format, Hickman and Rock Bridge met on the gridiron twice in the same season for the first time. The second game was played at Hickman Stadium (renamed Alumni Stadium at Robert M. Lemone Field in 2012 or 2013) as a result of Hickman&#x27;s better seeding in the new District tournament format.

Jefferson City–Hickman series
The two football teams have met every year, at least once a year since 1919, with the series starting in 1911. The football series (after the 2023 game) is currently led by Jefferson City at 62–53–4. After the win in the 2010 game (the fifth straight victory in the series) the Jays tied the Kewpies for the first time since 1919 when the series record became 3–3–3. The Jays have never led in the football series with the Kewpies although they have been tied 6 different times (after the second meeting in 1911 (series record of 1–1), after both ties in 1912 (records of 1–1–1 and 1–1–2), after the second meeting in 1913 (record of 2–2–2), after the 1919 game and after the 2010 game.) This is the premier (most heated) rivalry among Central Missouri&#x27;s largest schools and is said to be the second-longest running rivalry in Missouri after the Kirkwood–Webster Groves Rivalry.

The first state wrestling tournament for high school wrestlers in the state of Missouri was held in 1931 at the Rothwell gym on the University of Missouri campus. Hickman High School competed in this first tournament under the instruction of Coach Fowler Young. Young was also a varsity wrestler for the MU Tigers at the same time he coached the Hickman team. This first Hickman team became the first wrestling team to be crowned State Champs. Coach Fowler coached the team in 1932 and 1933. The team placed 2nd and 8th respectively.

The first lacrosse program in the Columbia area was started in 1998 and was composed of players from Hickman High School and Rock Bridge High School. The schools split ways in 2002, and the first Hickman High School men&#x27;s lacrosse team was formed. After graduation, many players went on to play for the University of Missouri Club team; however, after graduating in 2006, W. Kendall Eckles went on to become the first to play NCAA. He played his 2007 season at Fontbonne University in St. Louis, Missouri where he led the team as the leading point scorer.

===Academy of Rock===
Hickman High School boasts one of the most innovative music appreciation societies in United States public education. The Academy of Rock was founded in late January 2004 by students David Kemper, Dylan Raithel, James Saracini and teacher Phil Overeem. The general purpose of the club was initially to plan and execute a “Battle of the Bands” between Hickman and its Columbia rival, Rock Bridge, but soon grew to encompass several other enterprises.

Since its inception, the Academy of Rock has hosted nine Battles of the Bands, three at Hickman High School and two at a local rock-and-roll venue, The Blue Note. These four events raised a total of nearly $7,000 to support what sponsor Overeem calls “demotic music” (in other words, music created by and for the masses). Each Battle has pitted four Hickman bands against four Rock Bridge bands, the winners being as follows: J Murda and the Musicians (Hickman, 2004), The Tipper Gores (Hickman, 2005), Wayfare (Rock Bridge, 2006), Graffiti Out Loud (Hickman, 2007), and Molly Trull and Anodyne (Hickman, 2008), the Dorians (Hickman, 2010), the RPs (Hickman, 2011), Table for Five (Hickman/Rock Bridge, 2012), and The IRA (Hickman, 2013). The winning band not only has the privilege of hosting a summer benefit concert at the Blue Note but being staked to recording time in a local studio owned and operated by local Columbia musician Barry Hibdon, Red Boots. The four summer benefits have raised a total of over $3,000 for VH1&#x27;s Save the Music Foundation, Columbia&#x27;s community radio station KOPN, the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the Voluntary Action Center of Columbia, the University of Missouri&#x27;s Thompson Center for Autism and Other Neurodevelopmental Disorders, and the effort to rebuild Joplin, Missouri, after the 2011 tornado. In addition, Academy of Rock-sponsored bands have also raised over $2,000 to assist in rebuilding after both the Sri Lanka and New Orleans disasters, and the group co-sponsored a fund-raiser for Hurricane Katrina survivors that netted nearly $27,000. In 2013, The IRA, the winning band in that year&#x27;s Battle, opted to donate its recording proceeds to the Central Missouri Humane Society.

Besides the Battle of the Bands, the Academy of Rock also sponsors, mans, and programs KWPE 98.3 FM, the school radio station (home to Rock Therapy); curates the American Roots Music Listening Library in the school media center, which has been funded largely by the Assistance League of Mid-Missouri; partners with Columbia art theater Ragtag Cinemacafe for “The Academy of Rock Showcase,” which gives high school bands the opportunity to hone their chops in front of audiences and make money; partners with University of Missouri radio station KCOU in a “Take-over Program&quot;, during which eight pairs of Hickman DJs operate the college station for 12 to 16 hours in one- to two-hour shifts; sponsors a monthly music documentary series in the school&#x27;s Little Theatre; and coordinates a live performance series that has featured free unplugged concerts by artists ranging from nationally known acts like The Drive-By Truckers (March 2005) and The Hold Steady (December 2006) to cult artists like former X co-lead singer-songwriter Exene Cervenka (see video),and Baby Gramps to local Missouri musicians like Witch&#x27;s Hat, The F-Bombs, Bockman, and Cary Hudson.

In 2008, University of Missouri student Chad LaRoche shot a brief documentary about the club to help those who are interested understand the club more clearly: Part 1 and Part 2 of the documentary are available on YouTube. A further technological aspect of the club spawned during that year was the &quot;Rock Therapy&quot; podcast , which featured Battle of the Band recordings, raw tracks from the concert series showcases, and the sponsor&#x27;s eccentric, lo-fi forays into the world of pop music.

April 2009 brought further recognition for the club: the national-award-winning regional magazine &quot;Missouri Life&quot; featured the club in an article by John Hendel . As soon as the 2009–2010 school year was under way, the Academy of Rock brought Pacific Northwestern punk-garage legends The Pierced Arrows (formerly Dead Moon) to the Little Theater stage for an October 13 concert-and-Q&amp;A. In the spring of the same school year, in collaboration with the Missouri Arts Council, Theater NXS, and MO Blues Society, the club presented northern Mississippi bluesman and Fat Possum recording artist Robert Belfour in two workshops involving over 100 students. Also, again aided by a grant from the Assistance League of Mid-America, the club augmented its existing media center CD collection with a selection of American classical music.

The Academy of Rock initiated a new program during the 2011-2012 school year: the &quot;Local Music Showcase&quot;. This program was designed to expose Hickman students to musicians in their own community and facilitate conversations through performances and question-and-answer sessions that could serve to inspire students to pursue their own futures in music. The opening performance in the series, on November 10, 2011, featured Moonrunner ; on February 9, 2012, Columbia &quot;indyground&quot; rapper Dallas held court . 2012-2013 was a very quiet year for the Academy of Rock, though, true to its mission, it initiated some new programs: a Sunday Night Showcase series at Columbia&#x27;s The Bridge , which featured concerts by Volatile, Space, Time, and Beauty, Ross Menefee, and The Pound Game, and a music-lesson scholarship , in partnership with The Columbia Academy of Music . The scholarship offers $250 worth of lessons to one underclassman boy and one underclassman girl per year. The club also procured two grants, one each from the Assistance League of Mid-Missouri and the Hickman PTSA, to expand the school&#x27;s CD library . Co-founder Phil Overeem retired from teaching at the end of the school year, turning the club reins over to Mr. Brock Boland.

==Traditions==
===The Cresset===
&quot;The Cresset&quot; is the Hickman yearbook. It has been a yearly tradition for the high school since 1912. Most of the past editions of the yearbook are available for viewing at the Hickman Media Center (Library) by the high schoolers as well as the general public (with special permission from the librarian); however, the Hickman Media Center is missing the 1913, 1914, 1916, 1917, and 1936 editions (although a few reside at the Columbia Public Schools Central Office), and several other existing editions are badly worn and in need of replacement. Donations to the Hickman archives of old Cressets in good condition are therefore requested and can be made by contacting the Hickman Media Center staff. All of the Cressets can now be viewed online.

=== Hickman Tunnels ===
Many legends, both confirmed and unconfirmed, exist concerning the Hickman Tunnels. The most popular legend is that there is a tunnel from somewhere inside the school traveling to Jefferson Middle School. Many versions say that the tunnel is in a state of complete or partial disrepair, others state that it is still intact. The tunnels were still intact 2015–2016 school year. Hickman&#x27;s school newspaper, &#x27;The P&amp;G&#x27;, featured photos of the tunnels.

=== Mascot ===
The Kewpie doll has been the mascot of the school for the last 100 years. Hickman is the only known school in the world with a Kewpie as its mascot. The name dates back to the basketball season of 1913 -1914 at what was known then as Columbia High School. Apparently, the school secretary owned a Kewpie doll, as they were popular figurines then, and she kept it on her desk. At one of the first basketball games in December 1913 she placed her Kewpie doll in the center of the court, and the entire game was played around it without it being broken. This was somewhat remarkable since the dolls were very fragile. Because it survived the game and brought a victory, it was thereafter considered the good luck mascot. You can see a picture of that Kewpie doll beneath Sam Church in the team photograph in the 1914 school annual. That team had a straight claim to the state championship of Missouri for 1914 as they had an undefeated season. Coincidentally Sam Church was the Captain of the 1914 Kewpie basketball team and was the first Kewpie to letter in four sports. The school annual, the Cresset of 1914 was the first annual to display a Kewpie. In addition to the doll between Sam&#x27;s feet in the team picture a drawing of a Kewpie appeared as a dedication to the team. The dedication said, “To the Basket Ball Team of 1914, whose loyalty to the school and to the Kewpie motto, ‘Keep Smiling’, has won the State Championship, this volume of the Cresset is dedicated.” The only previous known mascot for Columbia High School, which became David Henry Hickman High School in 1927, was the Trojans. It is referenced in the first school annual, the Cresset of 1912. Columbia/Hickman High School has graduated over 35,000 “Kewpies” in its history and they are still proud to be called “Kewpies!”

=== School song ===
The school song was written by Mr. C. M. Stookey, a music instructor at Hickman High School in 1944. It was originally called &quot;Kewpies on the March&quot;. The song is featured on the third page of the 1950 Cresset.

<text>Rob Benvie (born in Halifax, Nova Scotia) is a Canadian musician and writer who has performed with alternative rock acts Thrush Hermit, Bankruptcy, Camouflage Nights, and The Dears. He also records and occasionally performs live as Tigre Benvie.

== Musical career ==
Benvie first gained notoriety as the guitarist, singer and songwriter in Halifax rock band Thrush Hermit. Thrush Hermit also included Joel Plaskett, Ian McGettigan and Cliff Gibb. Touring extensively throughout North America, Thrush Hermit released two EPs on Murderecords: &quot;Smart Bomb&quot; and &quot;The Great Pacific Ocean&quot;. Their first full-length &quot;Sweet Homewrecker&quot; was released on the American label Elektra Records. In 1999, Thrush Hermit released &quot;Clayton Park&quot; on Sonic Unyon Records. In 2010, Thrush Hermit briefly reunited for a successful reunion tour, followed by another in 2020 with the reissue of &quot;Clayton Park&quot;.

Prior to the Thrush Hermit era, Benvie distributed numerous home recordings under such names as The Tennis Injury, Yammer, Drug Dog, and Day Pass. Since Thrush Hermit&#x27;s 1999 break-up, Benvie has produced several solo albums under his own name and as Tigre Benvie.

In 2001, he joined The Dears as bass/guitar player, and in years following continued to perform and record with the band in various faculties, most actively for 2008&#x27;s Missiles and 2011&#x27;s Degeneration Street.

Benvie and McGettigan have recorded and performed as Camouflage Nights. After a string of tour dates and limited edition audio and video releases, the band&#x27;s long-delayed debut LP was released in April 2012 by Sonic Unyon Records. Camouflage Nights has remixed artists such as Stars, Every Move a Picture, Pony Da Look, along with scoring numerous film and television projects.

In 2015, Benvie founded the rock band Bankruptcy. Their debut LP &quot;For The Future&quot; was released in April 2016. Bankruptcy&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Computers Make the Drinks,&quot; was released in 2019.

== Writing ==
In May 2001 literature and humour website McSweeney&#x27;s Internet Tendency featured an essay by Benvie titled &quot;The Porn I Like&quot;. Benvie&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Safety of War&quot;, was published by Coach House Books. In 2011, Benvie published a second novel, titled &quot;Maintenance&quot;, along with a full-length instrumental &#x27;audio companion&#x27; available via download through Coach House. His third novel, &quot;Bleeding Light&quot;, was published in 2021.

<doc id="613452" wikidata="Q1091197" url="?curid=613452" title="Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany">
<text>Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany ( – 10 August 1241), also known as Damsel of Brittany, Pearl of Brittany, or Beauty of Brittany, was the eldest daughter of Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, and Constance, Duchess of Brittany. Her father, Geoffrey, was the fourth son of Henry II, King of England.

After the presumed death in 1203 of her imprisoned younger brother, Arthur, Eleanor was heiress to vast lands including England, Anjou, Aquitaine, and Brittany, realms where the Salic Law barring the accession of women did not apply. Her uncle John, King of England, was the fifth son of Henry II, and Eleanor inherited Arthur&#x27;s claim to the throne as the child of John&#x27;s elder brother Geoffrey. Thus she posed a potential threat to John, and following his death in 1216, equally to her cousin, King Henry III; thus, having been put in prison in 1202, she was never released. As a prisoner she was also unable to press her claim to the Duchy of Brittany as her brother&#x27;s heiress.

Like Empress Matilda and Elizabeth of York, Eleanor&#x27;s claim to the English throne gained little support from the barons, due to the expectation that the monarch should be male, despite legal provision for a female monarch. Some historians have commented that her imprisonment was &quot;the most unjustifiable act of King John&quot;.

==Childhood==
Eleanor became fatherless at the age of two and was brought up by her uncle Richard I, King of England and grandmother Eleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine. By the death of her father she was the first in line of Breton succession, so Philip II of France asked for her wardship but Henry II took it in advance, while the birth of her posthumous brother removed her status as the first heiress.

However, being King Richard&#x27;s ward also meant that she was under Angevin custody; thus even her mother Constance never considered her a potential heir to Brittany, which weakened her later claim to the duchy. Keeping her custody under Richard was probably the price for her mother to rule Brittany.

As her younger brother Arthur was the heir presumptive to England and Brittany, she was one of the most marriageable princesses. In 1190, after Richard failed to marry his younger sister Joan to Al-Adil I, brother of Saladin, he proposed that Eleanor should be the bride instead, but the negotiation was also in vain, as Al-Adil showed no interest in Christianity. In 1193, she was engaged to Frederick, son of Leopold V, Duke of Austria, as part of the conditions to release Richard, who Emperor Henry VI had taken prisoner. However, when she was on the way to Austria with Baldwin of Bethune the next year, the duke died, so the marriage never took place, and under order of Pope Celestine III she returned to England, accompanied by her grandmother Eleanor.

In summer 1195, a marriage between her and Louis, son of Philip II of France, was suggested, for an alliance between Richard and Philip, but negotiations failed again. Emperor Henry VI opposed the marriage; and the failure was also a sign that the King would replace Arthur as heir to England with his only living brother, John. This soon led to a sudden deterioration in relations between Richard and Philip. Another marriage, with Duke Odo of Burgundy, may have been suggested, for in 1198 Philip forbade Odo to marry any relatives of Richard without his permission.

It was uncertain where Eleanor lived between 1195 and 1198, while Leon Guilloreau believed she was in Brittany, prior to Michaelmas 1198 she was in Arques-la-Bataille, Normandy.

==Imprisonment==

===Under John===
Upon the death of King Richard in 1199, a power struggle commenced between the supporters of 12-year-old Arthur and Richard&#x27;s youngest brother, John. A Pipe Roll 2 dated – 1200 indicated John provided &quot;necessaries&quot; to Eleanor. Arthur once complained that his sister was controlled by John. At the request of Constance, Eleanor was once released from royal custody and united with her mother and brother in France. Eleanor was probably already under John&#x27;s control when Arthur&#x27;s forces were defeated and he was captured at the Battle of Mirebeau, 1 August 1202, or captured along with Arthur. Certainly, there is no mention of her capture after the battle. Arthur disappeared mysteriously while in captivity the following year. However, as Eleanor was still a potential heiress, as John then had no legitimate issue, and was at least preferable to later claimants to the throne such as Louis of France, it is unlikely that John had already decided to confine his niece for life.

On 6 December the same year, John fled Normandy taking with him Eleanor, his captive. It was said that she was initially taken to the North of England and then to Bristol, guarded by four knights. In spring 1204, Philip II of France demanded that Eleanor be released in order to marry his younger son.

Initially John organized local barons to visit Eleanor in order to prove her well-being. In 1206, John briefly detained her at Brough Castle in Westmorland (now in Cumbria), entrusting her to Robert de Vieuxpont who was its custodian, before moving her to Bowes Castle in the North Riding of Yorkshire (now in County Durham) and, finally, Corfe Castle in the Isle of Purbeck on the Dorset coast, along with 25 French knights loyal to her, guarded by Stephen de Turnham. After an attempt to escape, 22 of them were recaptured and starved to death. 

Eleanor lived in Corfe&#x27;s Gloriet Tower, took her meals in the Long Hall and was allowed to walk abroad along the walls. She was allowed three maids and was provided fabric for clothes and bedding, and pocket money as much as 5 marks per quarter. She also received from John a saddle with gilded reins and scarlet ornaments, a gift which implies that she was not closely confined. John also sent her figs and almonds. A week&#x27;s shopping list for Eleanor in captivity that has survived suggests the aristocratic diet at that time: Saturday: bread, ale, sole, almonds, butter, eggs. Sunday: mutton, pork, chicken and eggs. Monday: beef, pork, honey, vinegar. Tuesday. pork, eggs, egret. Wednesday: herring, conger, sole, eels, almonds and eggs. Thursday: pork, eggs, pepper, honey. Friday: conger, sole, eels, herring and almonds.

As the eldest daughter of Constance, Eleanor should have been recognized as Duchess of Brittany after the death of her brother Arthur. Instead, the Breton barons, fearing John&#x27;s claims to rule Brittany in representation of Eleanor&#x27;s rights or to marry her to a vassal loyal to England, made her younger half-sister Alix duchess instead. Eleanor was styled Duchess of Brittany and Countess of Richmond, as successor to her brother but this was only a titular title as Alix became Duchess of Brittany in 1203 and was also styled Countess of Richmond, even making charters about this estate. 

The Breton barons, ignorant of her whereabouts, were always ready to install her as duchess in case she were released. John permitted her to use the titles of Brittany and Richmond and even talked with Breton nobles about letting her go. In 1208, He had Eleanor write a letter to Breton barons and churchmen such as the bishops of Nantes, Vannes, and Cornouaille, describing her life in captivity, expressing her hope of being liberated and asking them to arrive in England to negotiate her release:

&quot;... uos rogamus attencius quatinus uos supranominati ad dominum auunculum meum Regem Angliae in Angliam ueniatis scituri pro certo quod aduentus uester Deo uolente nobis et uobis ad magnum cedet commodum et honorem, et per Dei gratiam ad liberacionem nostram.&quot; (I ask you most solicitously that you, the above-named, would travel to England, to my lord uncle, the King of England, knowing for certain that your coming, God willing, will confer great honor and benefit to ourselves and yourselves, and, by the grace of God, our liberation.)

This letter is the only surviving document written by Eleanor. This negotiation was however in vain, and many of her supporters were banished. Eleanor was forced to entrust Brittany and Richmond to John, who referred to her as his &quot;dearest niece&quot; in communicating with Bretons. John never gave her the lands which belonged to the Counts of Richmond. Instead he gave these lands to Eleanor&#x27;s former stepfather, the Earl of Chester.

In 1209, William I of Scotland sent his daughters Margaret and Isobel to John as hostages to keep peace between Scotland and England, and they were also imprisoned at Corfe Castle along with Eleanor. In June 1213, John sent green robes, lambskin-trimmed cloaks, and summer slippers to the captive princesses. They were sometimes allowed to ride out under the strictest guard. Eleanor was given robes of dark green with capes of cambric and hats trimmed with miniver. John once approved a doctor to prescribe medicine for Eleanor when she was sick.

In 1213, John used Eleanor to blackmail Peter I, Duke of Brittany, husband and co-ruler with Alix, into an alliance with England, tempting him with the offer of Eleanor&#x27;s Earldom of Richmond, but Peter kept loyal to France, even after John&#x27;s capture at Nantes of Peter&#x27;s elder brother Robert. In the same year John declared England a Papal fief, and Pope Innocent III thus claimed to be guardian of Eleanor. In February 1214, John campaigned in Aquitaine and Poitou with Eleanor, as well as his queen and Prince Richard, against Alix, hoping to get Breton support and establish Eleanor as his puppet duchess; his ambition was dashed in his defeat at the Battle of Roche-au-Moine. In July, John withdrew to England, with Eleanor still in hand. In the same year John again talked with Breton nobles about the rights and freedom of Eleanor but, after this expedition, John became convinced that he could get nothing from her claim to the Duchy; he recognized Alix as duchess of Brittany and never again supported Eleanor even in name: neither did Henry III upon his succession to the throne. 

Up to then Philip II had taken the bulk of Angevin territories, and neither Bretons nor Philip II ever positively requested the release of Eleanor, as it seemed more stable for them to have her imprisoned in England rather than become a French duchess.

In 1214, John gave Eleanor an even more luxurious scarlet robe.

On 15 July 1215 John instructed Eleanor&#x27;s keeper Peter de Maulay to customize clothing and bed sheets for Eleanor, stating that although shirts and bed sheets should be made of high-quality linen, they were not made of his own best fabric; however, if this was the only fabric that was suitable enough, Peter would be allowed to purchase it as much as possible with John&#x27;s money. This meant that John hoped that Eleanor will always maintain a subject after him.

The tensions between John and the Anglo-Norman barons finally began to spill over into the First Barons&#x27; War in 1215, and Louis of France led an invasion to England in support of his claim to the English throne, as husband of Blanche, a maternal granddaughter of Henry II, whilst Innocent III argued that Eleanor had a better claim than John. When the Magna Carta was issued that year, it was demanded that all John&#x27;s hostages including Scottish and Welsh princesses be released; Eleanor, however, was excluded.

There are different accounts of where Eleanor was held over the years. Some sources say that she was imprisoned at Corfe; others say at Bristol Castle, for all of the almost 40 years. However, the Close Rolls of Henry III confirm that Eleanor had run up a bill of £117 while imprisoned by John at Gloucester Castle.

===Under Henry III===
John died towards the end of the civil conflict in 1216; although according to the laws of primogeniture the claim of Eleanor was better, English barons allowed King John&#x27;s young son, Henry III of England, to succeed.

As her claim to England and Aquitaine was still a threat to his son, before his death John stated that Eleanor should never be released. Thus, albeit never a rallying point for English discontent during the early part of Henry III&#x27;s reign, the beautiful and defiant princess remained under gentle house arrest as before, no matter how much ransom the Bretons would pay (if any attempts). Her survival was ensured according to the treaty between England and France. 

In 1218, she ceased to be styled Countess of Richmond after William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke, Henry&#x27;s regent, recognized Peter as the Earl. Henry III styled Eleanor, now with no title left, as &quot;king&#x27;s kinswoman&quot;, or &quot;our cousin&quot;.

In 1221, there was a rumour of a plan to rescue Eleanor and deliver her to the king of France. In September, Eleanor accompanied Isobel of Scotland in Southampton, while both received robes, cloaks, hats, and headscarves lined with squirrel and deer skin.

In 1225, Peter de Maulay was accused of planning with the king of France to get a ship to spirit the princess away, and he subsequently fell out of favour. The allegation may have been false, to discredit de Maulay and Peter des Roches, who also fell out of royal favour in spring 1234. Whether the plot existed or not, Eleanor was soon moved away from the coast. From 13 June 1222, she was transferred between Gloucester (31 July 1222 to 20 July 1223), Marlborough (20 August to 9 October 1223 and January 1224) and Bristol (before Michaelmas 1224). She was finally settled at Bristol from June 1224 for a time and was visited by Henry III. Gloucester Castle temporarily moved all its prisoners elsewhere to accommodate the princess. A chamber in the tower of Gloucester Castle was thought to have been occupied by her. When Eleanor was relocated to Marlborough Castle, the council instructed that additional cavalry and crossbowmen should be added to the existing guards there. In 1227, the Bishop of Bath signed an order to increase the staff of Bristol Castle to help keep Eleanor confined.

Though Henry III established a law that could prevent Eleanor from legal succession to the crown and considered Eleanor would never legally inherit, from 1223 he and his government took serious actions to keep Eleanor captive. They appointed and monitored her keepers, and frequently changed them. Among her later guardians were: Engelard de Cigogné, Walter de St. Audoen, Richard de Landa, Gilbert de Greinville, Ralph Musard, Robert Lovel, and Matthew de Walop. Between 1225 and 1226, Bristol&#x27;s diet accounts showed the use of locks, keys, and other safety equipment. For example, the entry in 1225 recorded the cost of repairing the door lock on 27 June, purchasing a door key by 1 penny on 25 August, and spending 4 pence on the key to the tower on 25 December. In 1227, the Close Roll accounts mentioned the keeping of the keys to Eleanor&#x27;s room; a clerk named Robert was ordered to keep keys to Eleanor&#x27;s room until the chaplain or his successor arrived. Such records might mean that for a period of time Eleanor was locked in her tower or room.

Nonetheless Eleanor still enjoyed the treatment due a princess similar to the reign of John. It was recorded that she had her own apartments at the castles where she was imprisoned and received generous gifts from the royal family such as game, fruit, nuts, and wine. She also had proper but unshowy clothes. From 1225, she got an allowance. Between June 1225 and April 1233, the Court of Justice recorded an annual payment of 20 marks of relief to Eleanor, usually divided into quarterly payments of five marks; in 1229, the annual amount increased to 25 marks, roughly equivalent as her status as daughter of prince. From the 1220s onwards, Eleanor began to give away her stipends. Guilloreau speculated this might indicate that she became more serious after her childbearing years. Henry also paid for her body and medical expenses, and the Bristol Castle Rolls from 1225–1226 recorded the cost of Eleanor&#x27;s two baths. Some of the care she received in Bristol was essentially preventive rather than remedial measures after getting sick. She received blood letting treatment at three different times, two of which were with her chamber-women; The Diet once recorded a purchase of wine &quot;for the eyes of the Lady&quot;; It could be seen that she received considerable care without being ignored. In a wardrobe record from the 1230s, Eleanor was listed as one of the recipients of robes, after the king and queen, and before others.

The governor of Bristol exhibited her to the public annually, in case of rumors that the royal captive had been injured. This might suggest that the local people were sympathetic to her. In 1224, the mayor, bailiffs, four reliable citizens, and specific noblewomen visited her once or twice a week to confirm her safety, listened to various expenses, and recounted to Henry III. Henry III himself once sent her 50 yards of linen cloth, three wimples, 50 pounds of almonds and raisins respectively, and a basket of figs; he offered her another saddle, a proof that she could still go horse-riding; he once asked the mayor and bailiff to increase her household there. In 1230 she was provided 2 ladies-in-waiting. Sometimes local mayor, bailiffs, responsible civilians and certain noblewomen visited her to prove her safety.

In the spring of 1234, there were protests against Peter de Roches, claiming that Eleanor, the royal princesses and many noblewomen were controlled by foreigners or were being despised for marrying foreigners. But such protests were not directed at the deprivation of Eleanor&#x27;s rights and freedoms, but at her being controlled by foreigners. In 1234–1235, money was allowed her for books for the chapel.

As her guard Peter de Rivaux lost power in 1234, both she and the castle were entrusted to William Talbot instead.

In 1235, Peter renounced Richmond. Perhaps as a result of Peter&#x27;s rebellion, Eleanor&#x27;s status improved slightly. In October, Henry III granted the manor of Swaffham in Norfolk of the Earldom of Richmond to her, ordering the income and harvest of the estate to be hers, and writing to her about arranging representatives to obtain estate income, thus her income became comparable to a daughter of a king; he gave her game and robes more frequently than before, and allowed nun Margaret Bisset and the Countess of Hereford (the Earl&#x27;s wife or mother) visit her. However, in 1235, Pope Gregory IX stated that the descendants of Alice and Pierre were undoubtedly the heirs of Brittany. A survey in 1237 listed Eleanor as landowner of Swaffham.

In 1236, Eleanor had a dispute with wife of William there, and Henry III ordered that Mrs. Talbot be removed from her side. On 28 February Henry III wrote a letter to William, stating that Eleanor was eager to reconcile with Mrs. Talbot and ordering Talbot to have his wife speak to and remain with Eleanor as long as Eleanor was willing.

Despite these changes in the relationship between the cousins, Henry III never supported Eleanor&#x27;s claim to Brittany, nor did he give her most of the Earldom of Richmond; she remained imprisoned, and there was no indication that she had ever visited her manor. In 1236, William of Savoy maternal uncle of the queen was granted Honour of Richmond.

In November 1237, Eleanor met Henry III in Woodstock in good health. In the same year she was again kept at Gloucester Castle, again under the custody of William Talbot. The sheriff, John Fitz Geoffrey, paid for her expenses. As Rivaux reconciled with Henry III, William Talbot ceased to have Gloucester Castle. On Easter or November 1238, Eleanor was transferred back to Bristol Castle.

In 1241, Henry III regained Swaffham, and Eleanor only received a cash income from it by the gift of the king.

During her imprisonment for as long as 39 years, Eleanor was innocent of any crime, never tried or sentenced. She was viewed as a &quot;state prisoner&quot;, forbidden to marry and guarded closely even after her child-bearing years.

Scholar Gwen Seabourne believes that when Henry III was in power, Eleanor had already passed the childbearing age and was at least apparently unlikely to pose any risk to his regime; however, he remained determined to imprison his innocent cousin, which made his devout, kind, and innocent persona no longer so credible; with his suspicion and calculation not inferior to John, he should also be condemned more.

==Death and legacy==
Eleanor died as a nun in 1241 at the age of 57 or 59. She was initially buried at St James&#x27; Priory, Bristol, then reburied at Amesbury Abbey, according to her wishes, announced by Henry III. She also donated her body there. Considering the association between Amesbury and the Plantagenets, Eleanor&#x27;s final choice of burial place was probably a sign of submission and loyalty to her dynasty, but it may also have been her last protest about the fate of herself and her brother Arthur, as the abbey was dedicated to Virgin Mary and St Melor, a young Breton prince murdered by his wicked uncle who usurped his throne. However, neither burial place has a memorial for her remains.

The &quot;Chronicle of Lanercost&quot; claims that the remorseful Henry III had given a gold crown to Eleanor to legitimize himself and his descendants shortly before her death, and only three days later the crown was donated to young Prince Edward (the future Edward I of England) as a gift. Another version says that she only wore the crown for one day before returning it.

The &quot;Annales Londonienses&quot; recorded the event of her death, referring to her as &quot;Alienora quondam comitis Britanniæ filia, in custodia diuturni carceris strictissime reservata&quot; (in English: &quot;Eleanor, the daughter of the late Count of Brittany, long established in the custody of the strictest prison reserved&quot;), and noted that she was the rightful heir to England, although some years after her death Henry III was still unwilling to admit that he was initially not the hereditary king of England. The &quot;Annals of Tewkesbury&quot; record the death &quot;IV Id Aug&quot; in 1241 of &quot;Alienora de Britannia consanguinea domini regis Henrici Angliæ&quot; (in English: &quot;Eleanor of Brittany a blood relative of the lord King Henry of England&quot;). The &quot;Chronicle of Lanercost&quot; recorded Eleanor as being a most beautiful, determined, and tactful woman. The limited sources about her character are consistent with this assessment and suggest that she was never resigned to her fate, as even decades of confinement could not force her to relinquish her rights although there was little hope of their being fulfilled. Matthew Paris simply noted &quot;about this time died Eleanor, daughter of Geoffrey, count of Brittany, who had long been kept in close confinement&quot;, with no further detail of her life or situation. &quot;Florentii Wigorniensis Monachi Chronicon Ex Chronids&quot; recorded, &quot;Alienor, filia Galfridi comitis Britannia soror Arturi, obiit. (Alinor, daughter of Galfrid, Earl of Britannia, and sister of Arthur, dies.)&quot; 

The bailiffs there were commanded to provide tapers and alms for her obsequies. Henry III ordered her funeral to be as dignified as possible. Tapers, alms and candles for her obsequies totalled £20 7s.

In 1246 and 1250, Henry III arranged for a priest to say daily masses in a chapel at Marlborough Castle and Bristol Castle respectively in memory of Eleanor; In 1268, Henry III gave the manor of Melksham, Wiltshire, a place that Eleanor had been fond of, to Amesbury for the souls of Eleanor and Arthur, ordering the convent to commemorate them along with all kings and queens. Thus Eleanor became a benefactress to the abbey.

==Portrayals==

Nobody made Eleanor the heroine of any prose or poem for a long time, and the first academic article with her as its heroine did not come into existence until 1907.

Eleanor sometimes appears in historical fiction, for example, in Mary Robinson&#x27;s &quot;Angelina&quot; (1796). In Thomas Costain&#x27;s novel &quot;Below the Salt&quot;, the author has Eleanor escape, marry a knight with land in Ireland, and raise a family there. The series &quot;Through a Dark Mist&quot;, &quot;In the Shadow of Midnight&quot;, and &quot;The Last Arrow&quot; by Marsha Canham was also about the rescue of the princess, all suggesting that William Marshal also wanted Eleanor to be liberated. Eleanor also appeared in the novels &quot;Here Be Dragons&quot; by Sharon Kay Penman, &quot;Sirocco Wind from the East&quot; by Virginia Ann Work, and as the heroine in &quot;The Shimmering Sky&quot; by Rik Denton. Eleanor&#x27;s life story is also told in first person in &quot;The Captive Princess&quot; by J.P. Reedman.

In her poem &quot;The Lament of Eleanor of Bretagne&quot;, the Victorian English novelist and poet Menella Bute Smedley imagined Eleanor&#x27;s melancholy feelings as she aged under weary imprisonment.

<text>A covert operation or undercover operation is a military or police operation involving a covert agent or troops acting under an assumed cover to conceal the identity of the party responsible.

==US law==
Under US law, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) must lead covert operations unless the president finds that another agency should do so and informs Congress. The CIA&#x27;s authority to conduct covert action comes from the National Security Act of 1947. President Ronald Reagan issued Executive Order 12333 titled &quot;United States Intelligence Activities&quot; in 1984. This order defined covert action as &quot;special activities&quot;, both political and military, that the US Government could legally deny. The CIA was also designated as the sole authority under the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act and in Title 50 of the United States Code Section 413(e). The CIA must have a &quot;Presidential Finding&quot; issued by the President in order to conduct these activities under the Hughes-Ryan amendment to the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act. These findings are then monitored by the oversight committees in both the US Senate and House of Representatives. As a result of this framework, the CIA &quot;receives more oversight from the Congress than any other agency in the federal government&quot;, according to one author. The Special Activities Division (SAD) is a division of the CIA&#x27;s Directorate of Operations, responsible for Covert Action and &quot;Special Activities&quot;. These special activities include covert political influence and paramilitary operations.

===Impact===
According to a 2018 study by University of Chicago political scientist Austin Carson, covert operations may have the beneficial effect of preventing escalation of disputes into full-blown wars. He argues that keeping military operations secret can limit escalation dynamics, as well as insulate leaders from domestic pressures while simultaneously allowing them communicating their interest to the adversary in keeping a war contained. He finds that covert operations are frequently detected by other major powers.

A 2024 study found that state denials of covert actions, even when the covert actions were obvious, could have a de-escalatory effect (compared to making the covert action public).

==Domestic settings==
To go &quot;undercover&quot; (that is, to go on an undercover operation) is to avoid detection by the object of one&#x27;s observation, and especially to disguise one&#x27;s own identity (or use an assumed identity) for the purposes of gaining the trust of an individual or organization in order to learn or confirm confidential information, or to gain the trust of targeted individuals to gather information or evidence. Undercover operations are traditionally employed by law enforcement agencies and private investigators; those in such roles are commonly referred to as undercover agents.

==Black operations==

A black operation or &quot;black ops&quot; is a covert or clandestine operation by a government agency, a military unit or a paramilitary organization in which the operation itself is at least partially hidden from the organization or government&#x27;s own scrutiny. For example, in the United States, some activities by military and intelligence agencies are funded by a classified &quot;black budget&quot;, of which the details, and sometimes even the total, are hidden from the public and from most congressional oversight.

A single such activity may be called a black bag operation; that term is primarily used for surreptitious entries into structures to obtain information for human intelligence operations. Such operations have been carried out by the FBI, CIA, NSA, KGB, Stasi, Mossad, MI6, MI5, ASIS, COMANF, DGSE, AISE, CNI, MSS, VAJA, R&amp;AW, UDU, SVR, FSB, GRU, ISI, BND, BIN and the intelligence services of other states.

===History===
Law enforcement has carried out undercover work in a variety of ways throughout the course of history, but Eugène François Vidocq (1775–1857) developed the first organized (though informal) undercover program in France in the early 19th century, from the late First Empire through most of the Bourbon Restoration period of 1814 to 1830. At the end of 1811 Vidocq set up an informal plainclothes unit, the &quot;Brigade de la Sûreté&quot; (&quot;Security Brigade&quot;), which was later converted to a security police unit under the Prefecture of Police. The Sûreté initially had eight, then twelve, and, in 1823, twenty employees. One year later, it expanded again, to 28 secret agents. In addition, there were eight people who worked secretly for the Sûreté, but instead of a salary, they received licences for gambling halls. A major portion of Vidocq&#x27;s subordinates comprised ex-criminals like himself.

Vidocq personally trained his agents, for example, in selecting the correct disguise based on the kind of job. He himself went out hunting for criminals too. His memoirs are full of stories about how he outsmarted crooks by pretending to be a beggar or an old cuckold. At one point, he even simulated his own death.

In England, the first modern police force was established in 1829 by Sir Robert Peel as the Metropolitan Police of London. From the start, the force occasionally employed plainclothes undercover detectives, but there was much public anxiety that its powers were being used for the purpose of political repression. In part due to these concerns, the 1845 official &quot;Police Orders&quot; required all undercover operations to be specifically authorized by the superintendent. It was only in 1869 that Police commissioner Edmund Henderson established a formal plainclothes detective division.
The first Special Branch of police was the Special Irish Branch, formed as a section of the Criminal Investigation Department of the MPS in London in 1883, initially to combat the bombing campaign that the Irish Republican Brotherhood had begun a few years earlier. This pioneering branch became the first to receive training in counter-terrorism techniques.

Its name was changed to Special Branch as it had its remit gradually expanded to incorporate a general role in counter terrorism, combating foreign subversion and infiltrating organized crime. Law enforcement agencies elsewhere established similar Branches.

In the United States, a similar route was taken when the New York City Police Department under police commissioner William McAdoo established the Italian Squad in 1906 to combat rampant crime and intimidation in the poor Italian neighborhoods. Various federal agencies began their own undercover programs shortly afterwards – Charles Joseph Bonaparte founded the Bureau of Investigation, the forerunner of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in 1908.

Secret police forces in the Eastern Bloc also used undercover operatives.
===Participation in criminal activities===
Undercover agents may engage in criminal activities as part of their investigation. Joh defined the term &quot;authorized criminality&quot; to describe this phenomenon, which she restricts primarily to undercover law enforcement officers, excluding confidential informants. These criminal activities are primarily used to &quot;provide opportunities for the suspect to engage in the target crime&quot; and to maintain or bolster their cover identity. However, these crimes must be necessary to advance the investigation otherwise they may be prosecutable like any other crime. The FBI requires that such activities must be sanctioned and necessary for the investigation; they also stipulate that agents may not instigate criminal activity (to avoid entrapment) or participate in violence except for self-defense or the defense of others. Most other legislation surrounding authorized criminality is not uniform and is a patchwork of federal and state laws.

===Risks===
There are two principal problems that can affect agents working in undercover roles. The first is the maintenance of identity and the second is the reintegration back into normal duty.

Living a double life in a new environment presents many problems. Undercover work is one of the most stressful jobs a special agent can undertake. The largest cause of stress identified is the separation of an agent from friends, family and his normal environment. This simple isolation can lead to depression and anxiety. There is no data on the divorce rates of agents, but strain on relationships does occur. This can be a result of a need for secrecy and an inability to share work problems, and the unpredictable work schedule, personality and lifestyle changes and the length of separation can all result in problems for relationships.

Stress can also result from an apparent lack of direction of the investigation or not knowing when it will end. The amount of elaborate planning, risk, and expenditure can pressure an agent to succeed, which can cause considerable stress. The stress that an undercover agent faces is considerably different from his counterparts on regular duties, whose main source of stress is the administration and the bureaucracy. As the undercover agents are removed from the bureaucracy, it may result in another problem. The lack of the usual controls of a uniform, badge, constant supervision, a fixed place of work, or (often) a set assignment could, combined with their continual contact with the organized crime, increase the likelihood for corruption.

This stress may be instrumental in the development of drug or alcohol abuse in some agents. They are more prone to the development of an addiction as they suffer greater stress than other police, they are isolated, and drugs are often very accessible. Police, in general, have very high alcoholism rates compared to most occupational groups, and stress is cited as a likely factor. The environment that agents work in often involves a very liberal exposure to the consumption of alcohol, which in conjunction with the stress and isolation could result in alcoholism.

There can be some guilt associated with going undercover due to betraying those who have come to trust the officer. This can cause anxiety or even, in very rare cases, sympathy with those being targeted. This is especially true with the infiltration of political groups, as often the agent will share similar characteristics with those they are infiltrating like class, age, ethnicity or religion. This could even result in the conversion of some agents.

The lifestyle led by undercover agents is very different compared to other areas in law enforcement, and it can be quite difficult to reintegrate back into normal duties. Agents work their own hours, they are removed from direct supervisory monitoring, and they can ignore the dress and etiquette rules. So resettling back into the normal police role requires the shedding of old habits, language and dress. After working such free lifestyles, agents may have discipline problems or exhibit neurotic responses. They may feel uncomfortable, and take a cynical, suspicious or even paranoid world view and feel continually on guard.
Other risks include capture, death and torture.

===Plainclothes law enforcement===
Undercover agents should not be confused with law enforcement officers who wear plainclothesthat is, to wear civilian clothing, instead of wearing a uniform, to avoid detection or identification as a law enforcement officer. However, plainclothes police officers typically carry normal police equipment and normal identification. Police detectives are assigned to wear plainclothes by not wearing the uniform typically worn by their peers. Police officers in plainclothes must identify themselves when using their police powers; however, they are not always required to identify themselves on demand and may lie about their status as a police officer in some situations (see sting operation).

Sometimes, police might drive an unmarked vehicle or a vehicle which looks like a taxi.

===Controversies===
==Examples==
* In May 2007, ABC News, and later &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, reported that United States president George W. Bush had authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to undertake &quot;black operations&quot; in Iran in order to promote regime change as well as to sabotage Iran&#x27;s nuclear program. ABC News was subsequently criticized for reporting the secret operation, with 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney saying he was &quot;shocked to see the ABC News report regarding covert action in Iran&quot;, but ABC said the CIA and the George W. Bush administration knew of their plans to publish the information and raised no objections.
* In June the same year, the CIA declassified secret records—part of a collection of highly guarded documents called the &quot;Family Jewels&quot;—detailing illegal domestic surveillance, assassination plots, kidnapping, and other &quot;black&quot; operations undertaken by the CIA from the 1950s to the early 1970s. CIA Director General Michael Hayden explained why he released the documents, saying that they provided a &quot;glimpse of a very different time and a very different agency&quot;.

<text>Agapanthoideae is a monotypic subfamily of monocot flowering plants in the family Amaryllidaceae, order Asparagales. It is one of three subfamilies of Amaryllidaceae. It was formerly treated as a separate family, Agapanthaceae. The subfamily name is derived from the generic name of the type genus, &quot;Agapanthus&quot;.

Its sole genus, &quot;Agapanthus&quot;, is endemic to South Africa.

<text>The Perhentian Islands (Malay: &quot;Kepulauan Perhentian&quot;; Terengganu Malay: &quot;Perhentiang&quot;; Kelantan-Pattani Malay: &quot;Perhentiey&quot;) are a group of islands off the coast of Besut District, Terengganu, Malaysia.

The two main islands are Perhentian Besar (&quot;Greater Perhentian&quot;) and Perhentian Kecil (&quot;Lesser Perhentian&quot;). The small, uninhabited islands of Susu Dara (&quot;Virgin Milk&quot;), Serengeh and Rawa, lie off Kecil. As in the rest of Besut, people generally speak Kelantanese Malay. However, English is also widely spoken.

==History==
The name &quot;Perhentian&quot; means &quot;stopping point&quot; in Malay, referring to the islands&#x27; traditional role as a waypoint for traders between Bangkok and Malaysia. The islands were sparsely inhabited by fishers for centuries, although tourism now accounts for most of the economic activity.

The Perhentian Islands appear on many maps from the nineteenth and twentieth century as &#x27;The Station Islands&#x27;. This arises from the British colonial period, as an English translation of &quot;stopping point&quot;.

Pulau Perhentian was one of the islands where Vietnamese refugees or boat people landed during the 1970s.

The islands were gazetted as a marine park in 1994, prohibiting all fishing within two miles from the shore.
==Geography==
===Two main islands===

Nature tourism provides the economic base for the islands. Both the islands have white coral sand beaches and a clear sea. Popular tourist activities include scuba-diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands are home to numerous different species of monitor lizards, venomous spiders, and geckos. In the water and on the coral reefs, sea turtles, clownfish, cuttlefish, blue spotted rays, and black tipped sharks swim freely among many others.

The Perhentian islands have a tropical climate with temperatures steadily around 30 °C (86 degrees F) and frequent, brief thunderstorms. During peak season, the waters are calm, making conditions favourable for diving. There are dozens of dive sites around both main islands, as well as several off-shore sites.

===Seven uninhabited islands===
There are seven more islands in the Perhentian archipelago other than Perhentian Besar and Perhentian Kecil. These islands are uninhabited, but are accessible by boat and sometimes used as snorkeling and scuba diving sites.

===List of islands by area===
For land administration purpose, 9 islands including the 2 main islands form the Perhentian Islands Mukim of the Besut District. Of these, 3 islands were protected and gazetted as marine parks by the Department of Fisheries and zoned 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) from the shore at lowest tide.

Note:
Islands designated as marine parks.

==Transportation==
The Perhentian Islands do not have any paved roads or air strips. Transportation to, from and between the islands is primarily on speed boats from the jetty at Kuala Besut on the Malaysian mainland. Jungle trails connect the individual beaches on both islands.

==Climate==
The Perhentian islands experience a heavy monsoon season between November and February, and most of the islands are essentially closed off to tourists. Resorts and ferry services are stopped during this time due to the weather but there is still a boat service daily to serve the fishermen village at Pulau Perhentian Kecil. On average each year, the Perhentian Islands receive over 98.3 plus inches of rain and experience roughly 12 daylight hours.

==Utilities==
Utilities on the island have not kept pace with the rapid expansion in tourism. In the summer of 2007, two wind turbines were installed, although they were still not connected to the network as of August 2013, leaving diesel generators as the main source of the islands&#x27; electrical power. The islands have mobile phone coverage, but as of 2022 still lack a sewerage system, leading some resorts to discharge wastewater directly into the sea.

==Turtle conservation==
The Perhentian Islands are home to a significant green and hawksbill sea turtle nesting population. The Department of Fisheries runs a turtle hatchery on the islands to help address the declining turtle populations. Egg poaching from the beaches is a continuing problem.

<doc id="613462" wikidata="Q454573" url="?curid=613462" title="Marky Ramone">
<text>Marc Steven Bell (born July 15, 1952) is an American drummer. He began playing in hard rock bands in the New York City area, notably Dust and Estus. He was asked to drum for punk rock band Richard Hell and the Voidoids. He replaced drummer Tommy Ramone in the Ramones in 1978, and went by the stage name Marky Ramone from then on. He has also played drums for other punk rock and heavy metal bands, including his own band Marky Ramone and the Intruders. He continues to keep the Ramones legacy alive around the world with his band Marky Ramone&#x27;s Blitzkrieg.

Ramone lives in Brooklyn Heights with his wife, Marion Flynn. In 2015, he released his autobiography &quot;Punk Rock Blitzkrieg: My Life as a Ramone&quot;.

== Early life ==
According to his autobiography, he and his twin brother Fred were born at New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children on July 15, 1952; he is of Dutch ancestry on his father&#x27;s side and French and Boyan on his mother&#x27;s side.

== Music career ==

Bell began playing drums in 1971 with the hard rock band Dust, featuring Kenny Aaronson on bass and Richie Wise on guitar, and produced by Kenny Kerner. Bell recorded two albums with the band, before getting into the punk scene. In late 1972, following the death of the New York Dolls&#x27; original drummer Billy Murcia, Bell was the only seriously considered alternative to the eventually chosen Jerry Nolan. &quot;Jerry and I knew each other,&quot; he said. &quot;When Billy died, I went down to the loft where the Dolls were auditioning… I could do different time signatures, different accents, and I basically overplayed it – put in all these drum fills that weren&#x27;t necessary. And Jerry just kept the beat straight. So Jerry got it and I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

In 1973, Marky joined Estus and recorded an album of the same name, produced by the Rolling Stones&#x27; first producer, Andrew Loog Oldham. Bandmates for Estus included Harry Rumpf and Tom and John Nicholas. In the mid-1970s, Bell joined Wayne County &amp; The Backstreet Boys, then moved onto Richard Hell and the Voidoids and played on their first album, &quot;Blank Generation&quot;. In May 1978, Tommy Ramone asked Bell to join the Ramones; he accepted and was renamed Marky Ramone. 

Marky was with the Ramones for the next five years. He starred in the movie &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;, recorded the anthem, &quot;I Wanna be Sedated&quot;, and worked with producer Phil Spector. After five albums with Dee Dee, Joey, and Johnny Ramone, Marky was asked to leave the band in February 1983 because of a drinking problem. He was replaced by Richie Ramone who was himself replaced four years later by Clem Burke of Blondie (under the name Elvis Ramone), who was asked to leave after only two shows. Marky returned clean and sober in August 1987, and in total, he played 1,700 shows and recorded ten studio albums with the band (the most records amongst the band&#x27;s drummers) until their retirement in August 1996.

In 1996, Marky joined Dee Dee Ramone to form the Ramainz, performing Ramones songs.

In 2000, Marky joined Joey to record Joey&#x27;s solo album, entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry About Me&quot;. Joey told talk show host Joe Franklin that Marky was his favorite drummer along with Keith Moon.

In 1997 and 1999, Marky recorded two albums with his solo band Marky Ramone and the Intruders.
In 2001, he was presented with a lifetime achievement award from MTV by U2 singer Bono.
In September 2004, Ramone served as executive producer and released a Ramones DVD entitled &quot;&quot;, which featured footage of the band while on tour all over the world along with other various rare, vintage footage. Much of the candid footage is courtesy of Marky Ramone&#x27;s personal video library. &quot;Ramones: Raw&quot; is the only certified gold-selling Ramones DVD and one of only two US gold selling releases in the Ramone entire catalog, the other being the greatest hits double LP &quot;Ramones Mania&quot;. &quot;Ramones: Raw&quot; is also the highest charting release in Ramones history.

On April 22, 2008, Marky Ramone appeared on a new CD in Canada playing drums with the Canadian punk band Teenage Head. The CD was called &quot;Teenage Head with Marky Ramone&quot;; it was released in the USA on June 10, 2008.

<text>John William Cummings (October 8, 1948 – September 15, 2004), better known by his stage name Johnny Ramone, was an American musician who was the guitarist and a founding member of the Ramones, a band that helped pioneer the punk movement. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002. Until the band&#x27;s disbandment in 1996, Johnny, along with the lead vocalist Joey Ramone, were the only two original members who stayed since its inception.

In 2009, Ramone appeared on &quot;Time&quot;″s list of &quot;The 10 Greatest Electric-Guitar Players&quot;. He ranked No. 8 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s 2012 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and No. 28 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s similarly titled 2015 list. Alongside his music career, Ramone appeared in nearly a dozen films, in documentaries, and on television. Ramone&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Commando&quot;, was released posthumously in 2012.

== Early life ==
John William Cummings was born in Queens, New York City, on October 8, 1948, the only child of Estelle, a waitress of Polish and Ukrainian descent, and Francis William Cummings, a construction worker (a steamfitter) of Irish descent. He was raised in the Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens, where he grew up absorbing rock music. Cummings&#x27;s father was a strict disciplinarian. Johnny is quoted as saying: &quot;My father would get on these tangents about how he never missed a day&#x27;s work. I broke my big toe the day I had to go pitch a Little League game and he&#x27;s going, &#x27;What are you – a baby? What did I do, raise a baby? You go play.&#x27; And even though my toe was broken I had to go pitch the game anyway. It was terrible.&quot;

As a teenager, Cummings played in a band called the Tangerine Puppets alongside future Ramones drummer Tamás Erdélyi (better known as Tommy Ramone). Cummings was known as a &quot;greaser&quot;, though he was later described as a tie-dye-wearing Stooges fan. He was a lifelong New York Yankees fan. Cummings also worked as a plumber with his father before the Ramones became successful. At one point, he attended Peekskill Military Academy in Peekskill, New York.

== Career ==
=== Ramones ===
Cummings met future bandmate Douglas Colvin, later to become Dee Dee Ramone, in the early 1970s while delivering dry cleaning. They would eat lunch together and discuss their mutual love of bands like the Stooges and MC5. Together they went to Manny&#x27;s Music in New York City in January 1974, where Johnny bought a used blue Mosrite Ventures II guitar for just over $54. On the same trip, Dee Dee bought a Danelectro bass. They collaborated with future bandmate Jeffrey Hyman, later to become Joey Ramone, to form the Ramones with Richie Stern on bass. Stern left after a few rehearsals. Thomas Erdélyi, later to be Tommy Ramone, joined the Ramones in the summer of that year after public auditions failed to produce a satisfactory drummer. The members of the band each used the &quot;Ramone&quot; surname, and Cummings became known as Johnny Ramone.

The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Ramones&quot;, was greeted positively by rock critics. The album was not a commercial success, reaching only number 111 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Their next two albums, &quot;Leave Home&quot; and &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot;, were released in 1977. &quot;Rocket to Russia&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest-charting album to date, reaching number 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 1978, the band released their fourth studio album, &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;. It failed to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100. However, &quot;I Wanna Be Sedated&quot;, which appeared both on the album and as a single, would become one of the band&#x27;s best-known songs. The artwork on the album&#x27;s cover was done by &quot;Punk&quot; magazine cofounder John Holmstrom.

After the band&#x27;s movie debut in Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot; (1979), producer Phil Spector became interested in the Ramones and produced their 1980 album &quot;End of the Century&quot;. There is a long-disputed rumor that during the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff.

&quot;Pleasant Dreams&quot;, the band&#x27;s sixth album, was released in 1981. It continued the trend established by &quot;End of the Century&quot;, taking the band further from the raw punk sound of its early records. Johnny would contend in retrospect that this direction was a record company decision, a continued futile attempt to get airplay on American radio.

&quot;Subterranean Jungle&quot;, produced by Ritchie Cordell and Glen Kolotkin, was released in 1983. According to &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, it brought the band &quot;back to where they once belonged: junky &#x27;60s pop adjusted for current tastes&quot;, which among other things meant &quot;easing off the breakneck rhythm that was once Ramones dogma.&quot;

Johnny Ramone was responsible for initiating one of the major sources of animosity within the band when he began dating and later married Linda Daniele, who had previously dated Joey Ramone. Though the band remained together for years after this incident, relations between Johnny and Joey remained strained.

The Ramones performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. On August 6, 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, they played a farewell concert at the Palace in Hollywood and disbanded.

Recognition of the band&#x27;s importance grew over the years. The Ramones ranked number 26 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; and number 17 in VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by &quot;Spin&quot;, trailing only The Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the original four members and Tommy&#x27;s replacement on drums, Marky Ramone, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

=== Acting ===
Alongside his music career, Johnny Ramone appeared in nearly a dozen films (including &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll High School&quot;) and documentaries. He also made television appearances in such shows as &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1F01 &quot;Rosebud&quot;, 1993) and &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot; (Episode 5 &quot;Bobcat&quot;).

In 2001, Johnny appeared in an English-language Spanish science fiction film called &quot;Stranded.&quot;

== Guitar technique ==
Being almost exclusively a rhythm guitarist, Johnny Ramone mostly used downstrokes throughout his career; he also used full, six-string barre chords and occasional power chords. This unique technique, combined with his characteristic tone from his guitar amp, produced a guitar sound that was far more aggressive and rhythmic than that of his contemporaries, heavily influencing early punk rock groups.

Johnny saw himself as a rhythm guitarist. For the most part, he disliked lengthy guitar solos, and consequently never attempted to gain much skill in this area of playing. Despite this, Johnny did play simple lead guitar parts on a small number of Ramones recordings, such as &quot;Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue&quot; and &quot;California Sun&quot;. A brief guitar solo can also be found on live versions of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make It on Time&quot;, in which Johnny plays a descending E minor pentatonic scale, ending it off with a whole step bend. However, the infrequent guitar solos on the group&#x27;s studio albums were usually overdubbed by Tommy Ramone, Ed Stasium, Daniel Rey, Walter Lure and other uncredited guests. Most of these small leads were only added in an attempt to give certain songs a more commercial appeal; they were not common on the band&#x27;s albums.

For example, Dictators bassist Andy Shernoff states that Jimmy Page&#x27;s rapid downstroke guitar riff in &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, an influential song that contained elements of protopunk, was an inspiration for Johnny Ramone&#x27;s downstroke guitar style. Ramone, who has described Page as &quot;probably the greatest guitarist who ever lived&quot;, stated in the documentary &quot;Ramones: The True Story&quot; that he improved his downstroke style by playing the song over and over again for the bulk of his early career. Recording engineer Ed Stasium once stated &quot;Johnny makes it sound simple, but I can&#x27;t do it, and I bet Eddie Van Halen can&#x27;t. Not for an hour!&quot;. His style has also been an influence on many alternative rock bands, as well as on thrash metal performers such as James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett of Metallica, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth and Scott Ian of Anthrax. Guitar virtuoso Paul Gilbert has cited Johnny Ramone as one of his influences.

== Politics ==
Johnny was one of the few conservatives in the punk rock community and was a staunch supporter of the Republican Party. He made his political affiliation known to the world in 2002 when the Ramones were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. After thanking all who made the honor possible—clad in his trademark T-shirt, ripped blue jeans and leather jacket—he said &quot;God bless President Bush, and God bless America&quot;. When questioned on his conservatism, Johnny stated in an interview: &quot;I think Ronald Reagan was the best President of my lifetime.&quot; This was evident when the band released the UK single &quot;Bonzo Goes to Bitburg&quot; in 1985; Johnny pressed for a name change, finding the title insulting to Reagan, and the song was retitled on American releases as &quot;My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg)&quot; after a line from the song&#x27;s chorus. In this same interview, he said &quot;...I think punk is right wing&quot;; he added that &quot;when you think of who punks are, they&#x27;re greasers, people who didn&#x27;t fit in, but they didn&#x27;t back down either. Who above all, love America.&quot;

Johnny is quoted by &quot;The Observer&quot; as saying: &quot;People drift towards liberalism at a young age, and I always hope they change when they see how the world really is.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Johnny&#x27;s early adulthood was marked by bouts of delinquency which he stated were inexplicable at the time. &quot;I didn&#x27;t become a delinquent until I got out of high school. I had a two-year run. I&#x27;d go out and hit kids and take their money and rob everybody&#x27;s pocketbooks. Just being bad every minute of the day. It was terrible. I don&#x27;t know what my problem was. Things that were funny to me at the time were horrible... At about 20 years old, I stopped drinking and doing drugs, got a job and tried to be normal.&quot;

Johnny married his first wife, Rosana Cummings, in 1972. However, by 1976, they split up.

In 1983, Johnny was severely injured in a fight with Seth Macklin of the band Sub Zero Construction. He was saved by emergency brain surgery and, according to a reporter at the time, &quot;got better fast. He plays the same but his hair is a little shorter.&quot; This incident was said to have inspired the next album&#x27;s title, &quot;Too Tough to Die&quot;.

Johnny married his second wife, Linda, in 1984 at the office of the city clerk in New York City. She had originally dated Joey Ramone, but left him for Johnny. Joey and Johnny continued to tour as the Ramones after this, but their relationship worsened. However, despite reports that they had stopped talking to each other altogether, Johnny talks fondly of Joey in his book &quot;Commando&quot;. Years later, when Joey was in the hospital dying of lymphoma, Johnny refused to telephone him. Johnny later discussed this incident in the film &quot;End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones&quot;, saying an attempt at such a reunion would have been futile. He did add that he was very depressed after Joey&#x27;s death. When pressed, he acknowledged that this was because of the bond forged by the band. In their road manager Monte Melnick&#x27;s book about his time with the Ramones, Johnny is quoted as having said, &quot;I&#x27;m not doing anything without him. I felt that was it. He was my partner. Me and him. I miss that.&quot;

Johnny was Catholic. Though he considered himself religious, he did not attend church due to physical abuse he suffered at the hands of nuns as a youth.

Johnny also was an avid collector of baseball cards and movie posters.

== Death ==
Johnny Ramone died in his Los Angeles home on September 15, 2004, at the age of 55, following a five-year battle with prostate cancer. Many of his friends and musical contemporaries came to pay their respects. His wife Linda kept his ashes, though there is a cenotaph monument to Ramone at Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, California.

=== Posthumous honors ===
Prior to Johnny&#x27;s death in 2004, Arturo Vega had suggested a monument to Johnny. &quot;I suggested some kind of monument ... He agreed right away. The monument was my idea; the statue was his idea,&quot; relayed Vega. Shortly after Johnny&#x27;s death, his wife Linda oversaw the creation and erection of an 8 ft tall bronze memorial statue of Johnny at Hollywood Forever. It was designed by Wayne Toth, based on a gift given by Rob Zombie, and was unveiled at a ceremony coordinated by Linda on January 14, 2005. Many of Johnny and Linda&#x27;s friends spoke at the ceremony, including Zombie, Nicolas Cage, Eddie Vedder, Tommy Ramone, C.J. Ramone, Vincent Gallo, John Frusciante, Seymour Stein, Pete Yorn and others.

In 2006, the remake of the horror film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; was dedicated to Johnny Ramone&#x27;s memory, as he was a close friend of the film&#x27;s producer and star, Nicolas Cage. The lyrics for Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2006 single &quot;Life Wasted&quot; were written by Eddie Vedder in honor of Johnny Ramone while driving home from his funeral. Pearl Jam also made their first video in eight years for this song. The song &quot;Come Back&quot; from Pearl Jam is also related to the death of Johnny Ramone.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Johnny Ramone 16th on its 2009 list of the Greatest Guitarists of All Time. That year, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included him on its list of the &quot;10 Best Electric Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

An annual Johnny Ramone memorial is held every year in Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The Annual Johnny Ramone Tribute is presented by Linda Ramone and is held as a benefit for the Johnny Ramone cancer research fund which is led by Dr. David Agus at the USC Westside prostate cancer research center. The events have been attended by celebrities such as Vincent Gallo, Lisa Marie Presley, Priscilla Presley, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Chris Cornell, Eddie Vedder, Billie Joe Armstrong, Duff McKagan, Rob Zombie, Kirk Hammett, Steve Jones, and Traci Lords. Additional celebrities who have taken part in the events include John Waters, Rose McGowan, Henry Rollins and Johnny Depp.

Lisa Marie Presley recorded a cover of the Ramones&#x27; song &quot;Here Today, Gone Tomorrow&quot; on her 2005 album &quot;Now What&quot;. She printed in the liner notes of the CD:

On September 15, 2022, John Frusciante performed a cover of the Ramones&#x27; song &quot;I Remember You&quot; during the Red Hot Chili Peppers show in Orlando to honor Johnny on the 18th anniversary of his death.

<text>Matthew Frederick Robert Good (born June 29, 1971) is a Canadian musician. He was the lead singer and songwriter for the Matthew Good Band, one of the most successful alternative rock bands in Canada during the 1990s and early 2000s. Since the band disbanded in 2002, Good has pursued a solo career and established himself as a political commentator and mental health activist. Between 1996 and 2016, with sales by Matthew Good Band included, Good was the 25th best-selling Canadian artist in Canada. Good has been nominated for 21 Juno Awards during his career, winning four.

==Early life and career==
Matthew Good&#x27;s father was a colonial Englishman from India and his mother was from British Columbia, Canada. Good&#x27;s introduction into the music scene began while he was in high school, when he was asked by members of a folk group to write lyrics for them. Good then began singing with the group. Good taught himself to play guitar at age 20 and continued to write songs. Good&#x27;s early career in music involved a variety of folk demos and a stint as the lead singer of a folk band, The Rodchester Kings. Matthew Good and guitarist Simon Woodcock were discovered at an open mic at Simon Fraser University by manager Brent Christensen. Early Rodchester Kings demos were recorded at Fragrant Time Records in Burnaby by Greg Wasmuth and Steven Codling.

From 1992 to 1993, Good recorded short demo tapes called &quot;Left of Normal&quot;, &quot;Broken&quot;, and &quot;Euphony&quot;, which featured the acoustic songs &quot;Mercy Misses You&quot;, &quot;Heather&#x27;s Like Sunday&quot;, and the title track &quot;Euphony&quot;. In 1994, he won a prize from 99.3 The Fox&#x27;s Seeds, an annual competition of local Vancouver-based bands. The prize included recording time at a local studio/recording school, where, in September 1994, Good, along with band members Steve Codling, Judy Renouf, Eran Vooys, and Ariel Watson, recorded &quot;15 Hours on a September Thursday&quot;. This demo tape included the songs &quot;Second Sun&quot;, &quot;The Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Last of the Ghetto Astronauts&quot;. In December 1994, the band signed a publishing deal with EMI Publishing.

In March 1995, the original band went on tour across Canada. Upon returning home, the band split up and Matt started over with a new group of musicians.

==Matthew Good Band==
===&quot;Last of the Ghetto Astronauts&quot; (1995–1996)===
Good formed a three-piece rock band in 1995 composed of himself, drummer Charlie Quintana (later replaced by Ian Browne) and bassist Geoff Lloyd. Dave Genn originally only recorded with the band as a paid session musician. The four recorded the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Last of the Ghetto Astronauts&quot;. The band released the album independently in 1995, after which Genn officially joined the band. The band was not originally called &quot;Matthew Good Band&quot;. In fact, the first 5000 copies of &quot;Last of the Ghetto Astronauts&quot; were just titled &quot;MGB&quot;. After the album was released, &quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot; began to receive significant radio airplay, and people began requesting the song on radio and the album at retail stores calling the band, &quot;Matthew Good Band&quot;. At the time, the band had been having conversations about the band&#x27;s name, but the band then decided that the band would be called &quot;Matthew Good Band&quot;. Although initially popular only in the Vancouver area, the band began to have more success across Canada in 1996, with the singles &quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot; and &quot;Symbolistic White Walls&quot; becoming significant hits on radio and their music videos being played on MuchMusic. In December 1996, Matthew Good Band signed a two-album deal with Private Music.

===&quot;Underdogs&quot; (1997–1999)===
In mid-January 1997, on the first day of pre-production for their next album, the group was notified that BMG Entertainment North America was merging Private Music into Windham Hill/High Street Records, putting a halt to the production of the album. In mid-March, after negotiations, Windham Hill/High Street released the group from its contract. Good was paid what he was owed for the two albums, and the group then decided to record the new album regardless of label support, using the money received from the divorce of their contract with Windham Hill/High Street to fund it. The group then agreed to release the upcoming album under a distribution agreement with PolyGram Group Canada. After releasing the EP &quot;Raygun&quot; in May 1997, the band released their second full-length album, &quot;Underdogs&quot;, later that year. The album was produced by Warne Livesey, who would go on to produce every full-length MGB album and most of Good&#x27;s subsequent solo albums. The album spawned the singles &quot;Everything Is Automatic&quot;, &quot;Indestructible&quot;, &quot;Apparitions&quot; and &quot;Rico&quot;, all which were hits in Canada. In November 1998, Geoff Lloyd left the band and was shortly thereafter replaced by Rich Priske. On January 21, 1999, &quot;Underdogs&quot; was certified Platinum in Canada.

===&quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot; (1999–2000)===
In September 1999, the band released their next studio album, &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;. The album debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and featured the hit singles &quot;Hello Time Bomb&quot;, &quot;Load Me Up&quot;, and &quot;Strange Days&quot;. In January 2000, Good underwent vocal cord surgery after being diagnosed with sarcoidosis, prompting him to temporarily quit smoking. In March 2000, The band won two Juno awards for &quot;Best Group&quot; and &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;. Good himself did not attend the ceremony, and guitarist Dave Genn has been quoted as saying that he only attended for the open bar. &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot; became the band&#x27;s best-selling album, being certified Double Platinum in Canada and selling over 300,000 copies by 2016. In 2000, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Running for Home&quot; was featured in an episode of &quot;Higher Ground&quot;.

===2000–2001: &quot;The Audio of Being&quot;===
In the summer of 2000, Good stayed in a hotel for three weeks in Whistler to work on songs for the new album. Good later wrote that he spent much of the time &quot;trying to keep down food supplement bars, trying to forget the growing tension within the band, the high expectations of needing to produce &#x27;hit songs&#x27; (whatever they are these days), throwing up, and trying to find some semblance of direction in my personal life&quot;. The band entered the studio in late 2000 to record the material. The sessions saw a great deal of intra-band turmoil. In February 2001, the band began a brief tour of the United States to promote the American release of &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;. In June 2001, the band released the EP &quot;Loser Anthems&quot;, and followed it with what would be the band&#x27;s final tour in the summer. In August 2001, Dave Genn quit the band, though he returned four days later. The band released &quot;The Audio of Being&quot; on October 30, 2001.

===Breakup===
In November 2001, it was revealed that Genn had left the band again and Ian Browne had also left the band. In February 2002, Universal Music Canada confirmed that the band had broken up. In March 2002, during his first interview after the breakup was confirmed, Good stated that the breakup was &quot;a conscious effort on everybody&#x27;s part&quot;. In a 2009 interview for &quot;The Ongoing History of New Music&quot;, Good stated that he decided the band was done after &quot;The Audio of Being&quot; was released, citing him no longer wanting to placate the needs of the other band members and no one wanting to tour the record as reasons.

==Solo career==
===&quot;Avalanche&quot; (2003)===
Good released his solo debut, &quot;Avalanche&quot;, in 2003. The album featured major stylistic differences from those recorded with the previous band. The album featured the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra on several tracks, including the first two singles, &quot;Weapon&quot; and &quot;In a World Called Catastrophe&quot;. Good recorded the album with long-time MGB producer Warne Livesey, who earned a Juno nomination for the effort.

At the 2003 Juno Awards, Good and co-director Ante Kovac won the Juno Award for Video of the Year for &quot;Weapon&quot;.

===&quot;White Light Rock and Roll Review&quot; (2004)===
Good&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;White Light Rock &amp; Roll Review&quot;, was released on June 15, 2004. Singles included &quot;Alert Status Red&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Been a While Since I Was Your Man&quot;. For the album, Good elected to take a stripped-down approach. Rather than record each instrument separately, Good and his new band (which consisted of himself, former MGB bassist Rich Priske, guitarist Christian Thor Valdson and drummer Patrick Steward) recorded the songs as a unit, with Good adding vocals and additional guitar parts later. Good later noted that he loved the freedom of being able to write a song, enter the studio, and have a recording completed almost immediately, rather than having to deal with the sometimes arduous process of recording layers and layers of music for a single song.

Good encountered controversy with the video for &quot;Alert Status Red&quot;. Initially, the video was intended to be a concept piece, directed by Good. However, upon entering the editing stage, he realized he hadn&#x27;t shot enough footage to make his concept work. He opted to turn all of the footage over to Kyle Davison, who directed the video for &quot;In a World Called Catastrophe&quot;, to see if anything could be made out of it. Davison came up with his own concept, edited it together, and sent the finished product to Good. Good approved of the video, and made it available for download on his website. Good, however, was unaware that Davison had utilized several short clips of surveillance footage of the Columbine High School shootings in the piece. Upon hearing about the clips from individuals who felt the use was insensitive, Good pulled the video from his website. After watching it again, he decided to enlist the opinions of others, including MuchMusic, to see if they had any objections. Most felt it was reasonable, granted that the use wasn&#x27;t exploitative and helped to support the message of the video, a message that they believed was decidedly relevant. Good agreed. He then returned the video to his website and expressed his support for the work of his co-director.

===&quot;In a Coma&quot;, solo acoustic tour (2005–2006)===
In March 2005, Good brought in Ryan Dahle and Meegee Bradfield of Limblifter to join his band (replacing Valdson and Priske). Good noted that he was concerned his previous line-up had run its course creatively, and that, as a solo artist, he was graced with the freedom to change direction by involving different musicians. He hoped that Dahle and Bradfield might be able to lend a new perspective to familiar material. In April, the lineup entered the studio and recorded two tracks for the Matthew Good best-of, &quot;Big City Life&quot; and &quot;Oh Be Joyful&quot;. However, when Good undertook a brief tour of Ontario in July 2005, he was rejoined by Priske and Valdson.

A compilation of Good&#x27;s work with the Matthew Good Band as well as his solo material was released in September 2005, titled &quot;In a Coma: Matthew Good 1995–2005&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Oh Be Joyful&quot;, was released at the end of July.

Good took particular care in the production of the expanded deluxe edition of &quot;In a Coma&quot;, which included an additional CD and a DVD. In April 2005, Good entered the studio and recorded nine songs from his catalog, reworked and performed acoustically. As a nod to fans who were unable to find them, the CD also included all of the tracks from the out-of-print EPs &quot;Lo-Fi B-Sides&quot; and &quot;Loser Anthems&quot;. The DVD featured the complete library of Good&#x27;s music videos, including a new video for &quot;While We Were Hunting Rabbits&quot; from &quot;Avalanche&quot; developed by animation students at Sheridan College.

Following the release of &quot;In a Coma&quot;, Good began demoing songs for a new album. While promoting &quot;In a Coma&quot;, Good noted that he might use the release of the compilation to mark the end of the first era of his career, where he could then move on to write &quot;weirder&quot; music. In December 2005, Good previewed a demo called &quot;Black Helicopter&quot;, which he recorded at home using GarageBand on an Apple Power Mac G5.

In March 2006, Good embarked on a solo acoustic tour of Canada, which featured smaller crowds and more intimate settings. Good spent several weeks leading up to the tour reworking many of his older songs to fit a solo acoustic format, including rarities such as &quot;Fated&quot; and &quot;Life Beyond the Minimum Safe Distance&quot;. He was joined on tour by opening act Melissa McClelland, with whom he played a cover of the Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Hurt&quot; at the end of his solo performances.

===&quot;Hospital Music&quot;, live album (2007–2008)===
In the aftermath of divorcing his wife, developing an addiction to Ativan and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Good channeled the emotional turmoil into his next album, 2007&#x27;s &quot;Hospital Music&quot;. The album was the first self-produced effort of his career and was written during his recovery from overdosing on Ativan and a stay in the psychiatric ward. &quot;Hospital Music&quot; included thinly veiled allusions to his divorce (&quot;I Am Not Safer Than a Bank&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s in It for the Money&quot;) as well as darker subjects, such as Good&#x27;s close friend Rod Bruno (who appears on guitar, bass and vocals throughout the record) losing his father to cancer (&quot;99% of Us Is Failure&quot;). The album also featured two cover songs, a radically reworked version of the Dead Kennedys&#x27; &quot;Moon Over Marin&quot; and Daniel Johnston&#x27;s &quot;True Love Will Find You in the End&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Born Losers&quot; was also a success, peaking at #27 on the Canadian Hot 100.

&quot;Hospital Music&quot; was additionally influenced by Good&#x27;s proximity to Vancouver&#x27;s notorious Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, just blocks away from his Gastown loft. The opening sound bites in both &quot;Girl Wedged Under the Front of a Firebird&quot; and album-opener &quot;Champions of Nothing&quot; feature men narrating snippets of their experience from the impoverished neighbourhood.

&quot;Hospital Music&quot; debuted at the top of the Canadian albums chart, Good&#x27;s first number one album since &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;. The album also marked the end of his recording and publishing contracts.

In support of &quot;Hospital Music&quot;, Good embarked on a brief solo tour of the United States in March 2008, and began a full-band tour of Canada in May.

In 2008, Good released &quot;Live at Massey Hall&quot;, the first live album of Matthew Good&#x27;s career. Recorded at Toronto&#x27;s landmark Massey Hall in May 2008, it is an unaltered recording of that night&#x27;s performance.

===&quot;Vancouver&quot; (2009–2010)===
In July 2008, Good announced he had begun working on his fourth solo album to be titled &quot;Vancouver&quot;. After entering the studio in early 2009 to record &quot;Vancouver&quot;, Good confirmed that he had re-signed with Universal Music Canada and the new album would not be an indie release. The album was released on October 6, 2009. For about a month prior to its release, the album was made available on his website for free streaming, stating a desire to make his music as accessible as possible. The first single released from the album was &quot;Last Parade.&quot;

&quot;Vancouver&quot; was a reflection of Good&#x27;s experiences and opinions of his hometown. &quot;It&#x27;s kind of like the way we were, the way we arethat kind of thing,&quot; Good has explained, referring to a sense of the city&#x27;s &quot;depletion&quot;, mostly in regards to the situation in the Downtown Eastside. The album also continued to explore Good&#x27;s personal life, including his mental illness. He later described the recording of &quot;Hospital Music&quot; and &quot;Vancouver&quot; as having together &quot;closed chapters&quot; regarding his personal life, allowing him to focus his energy on a stylistically different project for his next album.

A Canadian tour in support of &quot;Vancouver&quot; was announced in September 2009 and ran from October 3 to December 19. Joining Good and his band as a supporting act was fellow Vancouver-based group Mother Mother. The following year, Good toured the United States from March 8 to April 4, 2010.

In 2011, &quot;Vancouver&quot; won the &quot;Juno Award for Rock Album of the Year&quot;, the second time Good has won the award.

===&quot;Lights of Endangered Species&quot; (2011)===
Good entered the studio on October 19, 2010, to record his fifth album as a solo artist, &quot;Lights of Endangered Species&quot;. He again worked with producer Warne Livesey, marking the sixth album Warne has produced with Good. Good and Warne&#x27;s Facebook wall postings stated tracking was completed November 20, while mixing of the record was completed on December 11. The album was mastered in England during the first half of 2011 and was subsequently released on May 31. The track listing was released in the members section of matthewgood.org on January 13, 2011. The first single from the album, &quot;In a Place of Lesser Men&quot;, was released on March 21 via SoundCloud. Good reunited with former MGB drummer Ian Browne during the tour of the album later in the year.

===&quot;Arrows of Desire&quot;, &quot;Chaotic Neutral&quot; (2013–2015)===
On November 5, 2012, Good announced via Facebook that he had entered the studio to begin recording his sixth solo studio album. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Had It Coming&quot;, was released on May 28, 2013. The album, &quot;Arrows of Desire&quot;, was released on September 24, 2013. The album&#x27;s audio was released to be streamed in Canada and Europe, as a promotion leading up to the album&#x27;s release (September 17–24).

On July 17, 2015, Good released the song &quot;All You Sons and Daughters&quot;, the first single from his seventh solo studio album, &quot;Chaotic Neutral&quot;. The album was released on September 25, 2015.

===&quot;I Miss New Wave: Beautiful Midnight Revisited&quot; (2016)===
In November 2016, Good announced on his website that he had been in the studio to re-record 5 tracks from the 1999 Matthew Good Band album, &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;. Good re-recorded &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot; tracks &quot;I Miss New Wave&quot;, &quot;Suburbia&quot;, &quot;Born to Kill&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; and &quot;Load Me Up&quot; and released them on an EP titled &quot;I Miss New Wave: Beautiful Midnight Revisited&quot;, which was released on December 2, 2016. The EP was promoted by a tour during February and March 2017 in which Good performed the &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot; album in its entirety.

===&quot;Something Like a Storm, Moving Walls&quot; (2017–present)===

On April 21, 2017, Good released a new song, titled &quot;Bad Guys Win&quot;, from his upcoming album. A music video for the song was simultaneously released. On July 14, Good released the lead single from the album, &quot;Decades&quot;, which was also accompanied by a music video. In September 2017, the album was announced as being titled &quot;Something Like a Storm&quot;. The album was released on October 20, 2017.

Good embarked on a co-headline tour across Canada with Our Lady Peace in March 2018. On March 27, during a performance in Edmonton, Good collapsed onstage due to pneumonia and was taken to a hospital. Good&#x27;s performance for the next show on the tour was cancelled, but Good returned to the tour on March 30.

In 2019, Good embarked on his first solo acoustic tour since 2007. On October 18, 2019, Good released a new single, titled &quot;Sicily&quot;. An accompanying music video was released on November 21, 2019. &quot;Sicily&quot; is taken from the 15-track album, &quot;Moving Walls&quot;, that was released in February 2020.

==Writing and political activism==
Apart from his music career, Good has also been a writer and blogger. From late 1997 through the end of 2000, Good published a series of monthly &quot;manifestos&quot; on the band&#x27;s website. Many of those were later compiled and released in his debut book &quot;At Last There Is Nothing Left To Say&quot;, published in 2001 by Insomniac Press ().

In a 2001 interview, Good said regarding his writing: &quot;It comes from the need inside of me to make fun of people. And my need to make fun of myself.
I like writing things that are both intelligent and subversive. There&#x27;s so much for me to write aboutsociety has become so absolutely ridiculous.&quot;

In 2008, Good created a new website entitled &quot;Dear San Diego&quot;, on which he wrote fictional journal entries. The website no longer exists, though some of the text is still available on some fan sites.

Throughout his life, Good has displayed a passion for politics and history which is reflected in his music. He has commented that he would have become a history teacher had he not found success as a musician. For many years, he blogged on his website about political issues, including US foreign policy and human rights. Currently, his website no longer features a blog.

Good has been heavily involved with Amnesty International, bringing Amnesty representatives on the road with him during his 2004 tour and offering a limited-edition soccer jersey on his website with proceeds going to Amnesty. In 2004, his song &quot;Annabelle&quot; was exclusively released on the Amnesty International Canada website.

==Personal life==
Good, whose family background is English, was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, and grew up in Coquitlamboth suburbs of Vancouver. After living in various parts of Vancouver for the majority of his career, Good moved to Maple Ridge around the time of &quot;Vancouver&quot;&#x27;s 2009 release.

Good has been affected by ongoing bouts of mania and anxiety throughout his career, many of which he credited to the stresses of popularity. He recalls regularly passing out and vomiting during the time of &quot;The Audio of Being&quot;&#x27;s recording in 2001. Behind the scenes of Good&#x27;s 2005 release of &quot;In a Coma&quot; and his subsequent touring, Good&#x27;s ongoing mental health concerns escalated, particularly following the unexpected separation from his first wife, Jennifer, in February 2006. In early 2006, prior to a solo acoustic tour of Canada, Good was prescribed Ativan to help counter his anxiety. During a stop in Kingston, Ontario, Good was rushed to the hospital following an adverse reaction to the Ativan. The last two shows of the tour were cancelled for what Good later explained was a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;.

The following summer, Good planned to spend several months in Europe to write a book. However, just a few days into the trip, Good found himself overwhelmed emotionally, experiencing what he described as the &quot;absolute worst manic episode&quot; while visiting friends in Bristol. He returned to Vancouver, moving into his parents&#x27; home. While there, Good began to have an increasing dependence on Ativan. One night, while at his parents&#x27; house, Good took upwards of 45 Ativan pills and collapsed to the floor. The collapse was heard by his parents and he was rushed to the hospital. During a brief stay in the hospital&#x27;s psychiatric ward, to which he willfully committed himself, Good was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The genetic illness was traced back to his mother&#x27;s side. Recalling past events and stages throughout his life, he has described the diagnosis as a relief, adding &quot;it was like finding the final pieces of the puzzle.&quot; Good wrote much of the material for his 2007 release, &quot;Hospital Music&quot; during his recovery.

In September 2013, Good spoke at the TEDxToronto conference about his creative life and bipolar diagnosis. His presentation was titled &quot;Balancing mental health and genius&quot;.
In 2021, Good was dropped by his label and management after his ex-girlfriend, Hayley Mather, accused him of being a &quot;serial abuser&quot; on her Instagram account, adding that during their relationship, he had cheated and constantly lied to her but also sexually coerced, groomed, emotionally and mentally abused and manipulated her. She later added “Everything that took place was consensual, however, I was told that fulfilling his fantasies were a way to bring our relationship closer together and that it would bring greater intimacy between he and I. It did not bring us closer together.” Good, who described Mather as his &quot;ex-partner&quot;, denied these allegations on his Twitter account.

On March 29, 2021 The Canadian Mental Health Association released a statement saying, &quot;CMHA has no current association with Matthew Good and will not be working with him in the future.&quot;

<text>The Union of Right Forces (URF) was a Russian liberal-conservative political public organization and former party, initially founded as an electoral bloc in 1999 and associated with free market reforms, privatization, and the legacy of the &quot;young reformers&quot; of the 1990s: Anatoly Chubais, Boris Nemtsov, Sergey Kiriyenko and Yegor Gaidar. The party officially self-dissolved in 2008. Nikita Belykh was the party&#x27;s last leader from 2005 to 2008.

In 2011, the SPS was refounded by some of its former members as the Union of Right Forces Movement. In 2012, it was registered as a &quot;political public organization&quot;, a type of NGO. In Russia, participation in elections requires being accepted into the list of political parties controlled by the Ministry of Justice.

Both the former SPS and the refounded SPS were accepted as a member of the International Democracy Union (IDU).

==Political party (1999–2008)==
The SPS was established in 1999, following a merger of several smaller liberal parties, including Democratic Choice of Russia and Democratic Russia. In the 1999 parliamentary elections the SPS won 8.6% of the vote and 32 seats in the Russian State Duma (lower house of the Federal Assembly of Russia).

In the 2000 presidential election, the SPS supported Vladimir Putin&#x27;s candidacy, though many of the party leaders supported Grigory Yavlinsky. The SPS parliamentarians overwhelmingly voted against reintroducing the Soviet-era national anthem in 2000.

The SPS was led by former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov from 2000 to 2003. During this time SPS strongly opposed what it saw to be the authoritarian policies of President Vladimir Putin, and argued that political and media freedoms in Russia had been curtailed.

In the 2003 parliamentary elections, the SPS, according to official results, received 4% of the vote and failed to cross the 5% threshold necessary for parliamentary representation. In single-mandate constituencies, SPS candidates Pavel Krasheninnikov, Arsen Fadzaev, and Alexey Likhachyov were elected to the State Duma of the fourth convocation (all three moved to the United Russia faction). State Duma deputy Anton Bakov joined the SPS. A number of SPS candidates came second in single-mandate electoral districts the party had previously held, such as Irina Khakamada in St. Petersburg, Vladimir V. Kara-Murza in Moscow, or Boris Nadezhdin in the Moscow Oblast. Despite allegations of fraud, Boris Nemtsov accepted responsibility for the election defeat and resigned as SPS leader in January 2004. On 28 May 2005 Nikita Belykh was elected as the new leader of the party.

Plans to merge with Yabloko were shelved in late 2006.

The party won 0.96% of votes in the 2007 elections, not breaking the 7% barrier, and thus received no seats in the Duma.

In 2008, Nikita Belyh left his chair to Leonid Gozman. On 1 October 2008, the federal political council of the party voted to dissolve the party and merge it with Civilian Power and Democratic Party of Russia, forming a new liberal-democratic party called Right Cause, which succeeded the SPS as a member of the International Democracy Union.

==Political public organization (2011–present)==
In 2011, a group of former members accused the Right Cause of being too close to the Russian government under Vladimir Putin and refounded the SPS, registering it as a &quot;political public organization&quot;. As a consequence, the International Democracy Union suspended the membership of the Right Cause and returned it to the new SPS.

On 27 February 2014, the SPS formally condemned the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="613476" wikidata="Q3299716" url="?curid=613476" title="Matthew Good Band">
<text>Matthew Good Band was a Canadian alternative rock band formed in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1995. The band consisted of singer-songwriter/guitarist Matthew Good, guitarist/keyboardist Dave Genn, drummer Ian Browne and bassist Geoff Lloyd. Lloyd was replaced by Rich Priske in 1998. They became one of the most successful rock bands in Canada during the late 1990s and early 2000s, being nominated for 14 Juno Awards and winning the awards for &quot;Best Group&quot; and &quot;Best Rock Album&quot; (&quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;) in 2000. The band broke up after the release of their 2001 album, &quot;The Audio of Being&quot;.

==History==
===1995–1996: Formation, &quot;Last of the Ghetto Astronauts&quot;===
After beginning his music career as a folk musician, Matthew Good formed a three-piece rock band in 1995 composed of himself, drummer Charlie Quintana (later replaced by Ian Browne) and bassist Geoff Lloyd. Dave Genn originally only recorded with the band as a paid session musician. The four recorded the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Last of the Ghetto Astronauts&quot;. The band released the album independently in 1995, after which Genn officially joined the band. The band was not originally called &quot;Matthew Good Band&quot;. In fact, the first 5000 copies of &quot;Last of the Ghetto Astronauts&quot; were just titled &quot;MGB&quot;. After the album was released, &quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot; began to receive significant radio airplay, and people began requesting the song on radio and the album at retail stores calling the band, &quot;Matthew Good Band&quot;. At the time, the band had been having conversations about their name, and decided that they would be called &quot;Matthew Good Band&quot;. Although initially popular only in the Vancouver area, they received more exposure across Canada in 1996, with the singles &quot;Alabama Motel Room&quot; and &quot;Symbolistic White Walls&quot; becoming significant hits on radio and their music videos being played on MuchMusic. In December 1996, Matthew Good Band signed a two-album deal with Private Music.

===1997–1999: &quot;Underdogs&quot;===
In mid-January 1997, on the first day of pre-production for their next album, the group was notified that BMG Entertainment North America was merging Private Music into Windham Hill/High Street Records, putting a halt to the production of the album. In mid-March, after negotiations, Windham Hill/High Street released the group from its contract. Good was paid what he was owed for the two albums, and the group then decided to record the new album without label support, using the money received from the divorce of their contract with Windham Hill/High Street to fund it. The group then agreed to release the upcoming album under a distribution agreement with PolyGram Group Canada. After releasing the EP &quot;Raygun&quot; in May 1997, the band later that year released their second full-length album, &quot;Underdogs&quot;. The album was produced by Warne Livesey, who would go on to produce every full-length MGB album and most of Good&#x27;s subsequent solo albums. The album spawned the singles &quot;Everything Is Automatic&quot;, &quot;Indestructible&quot;, &quot;Apparitions&quot; and &quot;Rico&quot;, all of which were hits in Canada.

The band toured across Canada with Edgefest during the summer of 1998. In November 1998, Geoff Lloyd left the band. Lloyd was replaced by Rich Priske shortly after. On January 21, 1999, &quot;Underdogs&quot; was certified Platinum in Canada.

===1999–2000: &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;===
In July 1999, the band again toured across Canada as a part of Edgefest, this time on the main stage. In September 1999, the band released &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;. The album debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart and featured the hit singles &quot;Hello Time Bomb&quot;, &quot;Load Me Up&quot; and &quot;Strange Days&quot;. &quot;Hello Time Bomb&quot; is their highest charting single in the U.S., peaking at 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay. In January 2000, Good underwent vocal cord surgery after being diagnosed with sarcoidosis, prompting him to temporarily quit smoking. In March 2000, The band won two Juno awards for &quot;Best Group&quot; and &quot;Best Rock Album&quot;. Good himself did not attend the ceremony, and guitarist Dave Genn has been quoted as saying that he only attends for the open bar. &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot; became the band&#x27;s best-selling album, being certified Double Platinum in Canada and selling over 300,000 copies by 2016. In 2000, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Running for Home&quot; was featured in an episode of &quot;Higher Ground&quot;.

===2000–2001: &quot;The Audio of Being&quot;===
In the summer of 2000, Good stayed in a hotel for three weeks in Whistler to work on songs for the new album. Good later wrote that he spent much of the time &quot;trying to keep down food supplement bars, trying to forget the growing tension within the band, the high expectations of needing to produce &#x27;hit songs&#x27; (whatever they are these days), throwing up, and trying to find some semblance of direction in my personal life&quot;. The band entered the studio in late 2000 to record the material. The sessions saw a great deal of intra-band turmoil. In February 2001, the band began a brief tour of the United States to promote the American release of &quot;Beautiful Midnight&quot;. In June 2001, the band released the EP &quot;Loser Anthems&quot;, and followed it with what would be the band&#x27;s final tour in the summer. In August 2001, Dave Genn quit the band, returning though four days later. The band released &quot;The Audio of Being&quot; on October 30, 2001.

===Breakup===
In November 2001, it was reported that Genn had left the band again and Ian Browne had also left the band. In February 2002, Universal Music Canada confirmed that the band had broken up. In March 2002, during his first interview after the breakup was confirmed, Good stated that the breakup was &quot;a conscious effort on everybody&#x27;s part&quot;. In a 2009 interview for The Ongoing History of New Music, Good stated that he decided the band was done after &quot;The Audio of Being&quot; was released, citing him no longer wanting to placate the needs of the other band members and no one wanting to tour the new record as reasons.

===2002–present: Aftermath===
Since the breakup of Matthew Good Band, Good has pursued a successful solo career, with Priske continuing as Good&#x27;s bassist until 2005. Genn has been a member of the Canadian rock group 54-40 since 2003 and has written and produced songs for several artists. Geoff Lloyd died in January, 2010. Good briefly reunited with Browne in 2011, with Browne drumming for Good on his &quot;Lights of Endangered Species&quot; tour. Rich Priske died on July 11, 2020.

<text>Garter snake is the common name for small to medium-sized snakes belonging to the genus Thamnophis in the family Colubridae. They are native to North and Central America, ranging from central Canada in the north to Costa Rica in the south.

With about 35 recognized species and subspecies, garter snakes are highly variable in appearance; generally, they have large round eyes with rounded pupils, a slender build, keeled scales (appearing ‘raised’), and a pattern of longitudinal stripes that may or may not include spots (although some have no stripes at all). Certain subspecies have stripes of blue, yellow, or red, mixed with black tops and beige-tan underbelly markings. They also vary significantly in total length, from .

With no real consensus on the classification of the species of &quot;Thamnophis&quot;, disagreements between taxonomists and disputed sources (such as field guides) are common. One area of debate, for example, is whether or not two specific types of snake are separate species, or subspecies of the same. Garter snakes are closely related to the genus &quot;Nerodia&quot; (water snakes), with some species having been moved back and forth between genera.

Garter snakes have been found to be one of the few species of snakes in the world to be both venomous and poisonous; both, however, are medically insignificant to the point that even affecting a human baby would be unlikely. Their poisonous aspect is only because of their diet, which consists of poisonous frogs.

== Taxonomy ==
The first garter snake to be scientifically described was the eastern garter snake (now &quot;Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis&quot;), by zoologist and taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus &quot;Thamnophis&quot; was described by Leopold Fitzinger in 1843 as the genus for the garter snakes and ribbon snakes. Many snakes previously identified as their own genera or species have been reclassified as species or subspecies in &quot;Thamnophis&quot;. The Reptile Database currently recognised 37 species in the genus, some with several subspecies.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Native to North and Central America, species in the genus &quot;Thamnophis&quot; can be found in all of the lower 48 United States, and all of the Canadian provinces. They are found from the subarctic plains of west-central Canada east through Ontario and Quebec; from Atlantic Canada and south to Florida, across the southern and central U.S. into the arid regions of the southwest and Mexico, Guatemala and south to the neotropics and Costa Rica.

Garter snakes are not originally native to the eastern Canadian island of Newfoundland, but have been breeding there in the wild and gradually spreading since at least 2010. It is unknown how they reached the island, probably accidentally via hay shipments or as escaped pets.

Their wide distribution is due to their varied diets and adaptability to different habitats, with varying proximity to water. However, in the western part of North America these snakes are more aquatic than in the eastern portion. Garter snakes live in a variety of habitats, including forests, woodlands, fields, grasslands and lawns, but never far from water, often an adjacent wetland, stream or pond. This reflects the fact that amphibians are a large part of their diet. Garter snakes are often found near small ponds with tall weeds.

==Behavior==

Garter snakes have complex pheromonal communication systems. They can find other snakes by following their pheromone-scented trails. Male and female skin pheromones are so different as to be immediately distinguishable. However, male garter snakes sometimes produce both male and female pheromones. During the mating season, this ability fools other males into attempting to mate with them. This causes the transfer of heat to them in kleptothermy, which is an advantage immediately after hibernation, allowing them to become more active. Male snakes giving off both male and female pheromones have been shown to garner more copulations than normal males in the mating balls that form at the den when females enter the mating melee. A snake hatch can include as many as 57 young.

Garter snakes use the vomeronasal organ to communicate via pheromones through tongue flicking, which gathers chemical cues in the environment. Upon entering the lumen of the organ, the chemical molecules will come into contact with the sensory cells, which are attached to the neurosensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ.

If disturbed, a garter snake may coil and strike, but it typically hides its head and flails its tail. These snakes will also discharge a malodorous, musky-scented secretion from a gland near the cloaca. This secretion from North American garter snakes contains seven highly odoriferous volatile components: acetic, propanoic, 2-methylpropanoic, butanoic, and 3-methylbutanoic acids; and trimethylamine, and 2-piperidone. They often use these techniques to escape when ensnared by a predator. They will also slither into the water to escape a predator on land. Hawks, crows, egrets, herons, cranes, raccoons, otters and other snake species (such as coral snakes and kingsnakes) will eat garter snakes, with even shrews and frogs eating the juveniles.

Being heterothermic, like all reptiles, garter snakes bask in the sun to regulate their body temperature. During brumation (the reptile equivalent of hibernation), garter snakes typically occupy large communal sites called hibernacula. These snakes will migrate large distances to brumate.

=== Social behavior ===
A long-term study by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has shed light on the social behavior of Butler&#x27;s garter snakes. The study, conducted in a 250-hectare area near Windsor, Canada, tracked over 3,000 individual snakes over a 12-year period. The findings challenge previous assumptions about solitary snake behavior and suggest that these snakes form social groups and communities. The study revealed that Butler&#x27;s garter snakes do not wander randomly but instead tend to associate with specific groups of snakes. These groups typically consist of three to four individuals, with some larger groups reaching up to 46 snakes.

===Diet===

Garter snakes, like all snakes, are carnivorous. Their diet consists of almost any creature they are capable of overpowering: slugs, earthworms (nightcrawlers, as redworms are toxic to garter snakes), leeches, lizards, amphibians (including frog eggs), minnows, and rodents. When living near water, they eat other aquatic animals. The ribbon snake (&quot;Thamnophis saurita&quot;) in particular favors frogs (including tadpoles), readily eating them despite their strong chemical defenses. Food is swallowed whole. Garter snakes often adapt to eating whatever they can find and whenever they can find it because food can be either scarce or abundant. Although they feed mostly on live animals they will sometimes eat eggs.
===Venom===
Garter snakes were long thought to be non-venomous, but discoveries in the early 2000s revealed that they produce a neurotoxic venom. Despite this, garter snakes cannot seriously injure or kill humans with the small amounts of comparatively mild venom they produce and they also lack an effective means of delivering it. In a few cases, some swelling and bruising has been reported. They do have enlarged teeth in the back of their mouth but their gums are significantly larger and the secretions of their Duvernoy&#x27;s gland are only mildly toxic.

Evidence suggests that garter snake and newt populations share an evolutionary link in their tetrodotoxin resistance levels, implying co-evolution between predator and prey. Garter snakes feeding on toxic newts can also retain those toxins in their liver for weeks, making those snakes poisonous as well as venomous.

==Conservation status==
Despite the decline in their population from collection as pets (especially in the more northerly regions, in which large groups are collected at hibernation), pollution of aquatic areas, and the introduction of American bullfrogs as potential predators, garter snakes are still some of the most commonly found reptiles in much of their ranges. The San Francisco garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis tetrataenia&quot;), however, has been on the endangered list since 1969. Predation by crayfish has also been responsible for the decline of the narrow-headed garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis rufipunctatus&quot;). Many breeders have bred all species of garter snakes, making it a popular breed.
==Species and subspecies==

Arranged alphabetically by scientific name:
In the above list, a binomial authority or a trinomial authority in parentheses indicates that the species or subspecies was originally described in a genus other than &quot;Thamnophis&quot;.

<text>A height gauge is a measuring device used for determining the height of objects, and for marking of items to be worked on. 

These measuring tools are used in metalworking or metrology to either set or measure vertical distances; the pointer is sharpened to allow it to act as a scriber and assist in marking out work pieces.

Devices similar in concept, with lower resolutions, are used in health care settings (health clinics, surgeries) to find the height of people, in which context they are called &quot;stadiometers&quot;.

Height gauges may also be used to measure the height of an object by using the underside of the scriber as the datum. The datum may be permanently fixed or the height gauge may have provision to adjust the scale, this is done by sliding the scale vertically along the body of the height gauge by turning a fine feed screw at the top of the gauge; then with the scriber set to the same level as the base, the scale can be matched to it. This adjustment allows different scribers or probes to be used, as well as adjusting for any errors in a damaged or resharpened probe.

In the toolroom, the distinction between a height gauge and a surface gauge is that a height gauge has a measuring head (whether vernier, fine rack and pinion with dial, or linear encoder with digital display), whereas a surface gauge has only a scriber point. Both are typically used on a surface plate and have a heavy base with an accurately flat, smooth underside.

<doc id="613485" wikidata="Q464299" url="?curid=613485" title="William S. Sessions">
<text>William Steele Sessions (May 27, 1930June 12, 2020) was an American attorney and jurist who served as a United States district judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas and the fourth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Sessions served as FBI director from 1987 to 1993, when he was dismissed by President Bill Clinton. After leaving the public sector, Sessions represented Semion Mogilevich, international leader of the Russian mafia. He is the father of Texas Congressman Pete Sessions.

==Early life and education==
Sessions was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, the son of Edith A. (née Steele) and the Reverend Will Anderson Sessions Jr. He graduated from Northeast High School in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1948, and enlisted in the United States Air Force, receiving his commission October 1952. He served on active duty until October 1955. He attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1956. He received a Bachelor of Laws in 1958 from Baylor Law School. At Baylor, Sessions became a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. He was an Eagle Scout and recipient of the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award from the Boy Scouts of America.

==Career==
=== Law practice ===
Sessions was an attorney for the firm of Haley, Fulbright, Winniford, Sessions, and Bice in Waco, Texas, from 1963 until 1969. He was then appointed Chief of the Government Operations Section, Criminal Division of the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., where he served until his appointment as United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas in 1971.

===Federal judicial service===
Sessions was nominated by President Gerald Ford on December 11, 1974, to a seat on the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas vacated by Judge Ernest Allen Guinn. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 19, 1974, and received his commission on December 20, 1974. He served as Chief Judge from 1980 to 1987. He served as a board member of the Federal Judicial Center from 1980 to 1984. His service terminated on November 1, 1987, due to his resignation.

===FBI Director (1987–1993)===
After a two-month search, Sessions was nominated to succeed William H. Webster as FBI Director by President Ronald Reagan and was sworn in on November 2, 1987.

Sessions was viewed as combining tough direction with fairness and was respected even by the Reagan administration&#x27;s critics, although he was sometimes ridiculed as straitlaced and dull and lacking hands-on leadership. He worked to raise the image of the FBI in Congress and fought to raise the pay of FBI agents, which had lagged behind other law enforcement agencies.

Reflecting the tensions between the Justice Department and the independent Bureau, Sessions announced that the FBI would be looking into whether Justice Department officials illegally misled a federal judge in a politically sensitive bank fraud case involving loans to Iraq before the Persian Gulf War, and 48 hours later Sessions was the subject of an ethics investigation on whether he had abused his office perks.

Sessions enjoyed his strongest support among liberal Democrats in Congress. Sessions was applauded for pursuing a policy of broadening the FBI to include more women and minorities, efforts which upset the &quot;old boys&quot; at the Bureau.

Sessions became associated with the phrase &quot;Winners Don&#x27;t Use Drugs&quot;, which appeared in the attract mode of North American–released arcade games from 1989 to 2000. By law, it had to be included on all imported arcade games released in North America, and continued to appear long after Sessions left office. The quote normally appeared in gold against a blue background between the FBI seal and Sessions&#x27; name.

Sessions&#x27; major contributions to the US criminal justice community include the encouraging of the FBI laboratory to develop a DNA program with a strong legal underpinning and the automation of the national fingerprint process. The latter project, known as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS), reduced the turnaround time from months to hours for fingerprint searches for both criminal arrest cycles and applicants for sensitive positions such as teachers.

Sessions&#x27;s final years as FBI director were marked by two highly controversial incidents: the 1992 Ruby Ridge standoff, during which an unarmed woman, Vicki Weaver, was killed by an FBI sniper, Lon Horiuchi, while she was holding a 10-month-old baby; and the 1993 Waco siege, which resulted in the deaths of 82 Branch Davidians, including 28 children. The Ruby Ridge standoff and the Waco siege were later cited as motivations for the Oklahoma City bombing, the deadliest act of terrorism in U.S. history before the September 11 attacks.

==== Allegations of ethics violations and dismissal ====
Just before Bill Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993, allegations of ethical improprieties were made against Sessions. A report by outgoing Attorney General William P. Barr presented to the Justice Department that month by the Office of Professional Responsibility included criticisms that he had used an FBI plane to travel to visit his daughter on several occasions, and had a security system installed in his home at government expense. Janet Reno, the 78th Attorney General of the United States, announced that Sessions had exhibited &quot;serious deficiencies in judgment&quot;.

Although Sessions denied that he had acted improperly, he was pressured to resign in early July, with some suggesting that Clinton was giving Sessions the chance to step down in a dignified manner. Sessions refused, saying that he had done nothing wrong, and insisted on staying in office until his successor was confirmed. As a result, Clinton dismissed Sessions on July 19, 1993. Sessions was five and a half years into a ten-year term as FBI director; however, the holder of this post serves at the pleasure of the President.
Clinton nominated Louis Freeh to the FBI directorship on July 20, 1993. Then–FBI Deputy Director Floyd I. Clarke, who Sessions suggested had led a coup to force his removal, served as Acting Director until September 1, 1993, when Freeh was sworn in.

Sessions returned to Texas where on December 7, 1999, he was named the state chair of Texas Exile, a statewide initiative aimed at reducing gun crime.

===Later career===
William Sessions was the American attorney of Semion Mogilevich, the &quot;boss of bosses&quot; of the Russian mafia, and a member of the FBI Most Wanted Fugitives list, with close ties to Vladimir Putin.

Sessions was a member of the American Bar Association and had served as an officer or on the Board of Directors of the Federal Bar Association of San Antonio, the American Judicature Society, the San Antonio Bar Association, the Waco-McLennan County Bar Association, and the District Judges&#x27; Association of the Fifth Circuit. He was appointed by Reagan as a Commissioner of the Martin Luther King Jr., Federal Holiday Commission, and was a Delegate for the Americas to the Executive Committee of ICPO-Interpol. He was also a member of the Constitution Project&#x27;s bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee.

Sessions was present on the American Bar Association task force examining the constitutionality of controversial presidential signing statements. It concluded in July 2006 that the practice &quot;does grave harm to the separation of powers doctrine, and the system of checks and balances that have sustained our democracy for more than two centuries&quot;. In 2008, he argued that the execution of Troy Anthony Davis should not proceed because of serious doubts as Davis&#x27; guilt. Sessions agreed to serve on The Constitution Project&#x27;s Guantanamo Task Force in December 2010.

He died less than two months after two former Acting FBI Directors, James B. Adams, and John E. Otto, and 6.5 months after another Acting FBI Director, William Ruckelshaus.

==Personal life and death==
Sessions married Alice Lewis, his high school classmate, in 1952. Together, they had four children: William L., Pete, Mark, and Sara. He filed for divorce on February 20, 2018, but this was dismissed without prejudice on October 11, 2019. Alice died on December 21, 2019 at their home in Washington, D.C.

Sessions was unrelated to Jeff Sessions, U.S. Attorney General (2017-2018).

Sessions died on June 12, 2020, at his home in San Antonio from complications of heart failure. He was 90.

<doc id="613492" wikidata="Q4948" url="?curid=613492" title="Republic of Venice">
<text>The Republic of Venice, officially the Most Serene Republic of Venice and traditionally known as La Serenìssima, was a sovereign state and maritime republic with its capital in Venice. Founded, according to tradition, in 697 by Paolo Lucio Anafesto, over the course of its 1,100 years of history it established itself as one of the major European commercial and naval powers. Initially extended in the &quot;Dogado&quot; area (a territory currently comparable to the Metropolitan City of Venice), during its history it annexed a large part of Northeast Italy, Istria, Dalmatia, the coasts of present-day Montenegro and Albania as well as numerous islands in the Adriatic and eastern Ionian seas. At the height of its expansion, between the 13th and 16th centuries, it also governed Crete, Cyprus, a number of Greek islands, as well as several cities and ports in the eastern Mediterranean, namely in the Peloponnese.

The islands of the Venetian Lagoon in the 7th century, after having experienced a period of substantial increase in population, were organized into Maritime Venice, a Byzantine duchy dependent on the Exarchate of Ravenna. With the fall of the Exarchate and the weakening of Byzantine power, the Duchy of Venice arose, led by a doge and established on the island of Rialto; it prospered from maritime trade with the Byzantine Empire and other eastern states. To safeguard the trade routes, between the 9th and 11th centuries the Duchy waged several wars, which ensured its complete dominion over the Adriatic. Owing to participation in the Crusades, penetration into eastern markets became increasingly stronger and, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Venice managed to extend its power into numerous eastern emporiums and commercial ports. The supremacy over the Mediterranean Sea led the Republic to the clash with Genoa, which lasted until the 14th century, when, after having risked complete collapse during the War of Chioggia (with the Genoese army and fleet in the lagoon for a long period), Venice quickly managed to recover from the territorial losses suffered with the Treaty of Turin of 1381 and begin expansion on the mainland.

Venetian expansion, however, led to the coalition of the Habsburg monarchy, Spain and France in the League of Cambrai, which in 1509 defeated the Republic of Venice in the Battle of Agnadello. While maintaining most of its mainland possessions, Venice was defeated and the attempt to expand the eastern dominions caused a long series of wars against the Ottoman Empire, which ended only in the 18th century with the Treaty of Passarowitz of 1718 and which caused the loss of all possessions in the Aegean. Although still a thriving cultural centre, the Republic of Venice was occupied by Napoleon&#x27;s French troops and its territories were divided with the Habsburg monarchy following the ratification of the Treaty of Campo Formio.

Throughout its history, the Republic of Venice was characterized by its political order. Inherited from the previous Byzantine administrative structures, its head of state was the doge, a position which became elective from the end of the 9th century. In addition to the doge, the administration of the Republic was directed by various assemblies: the Great Council, with legislative functions, which was supported by the Minor Council, the Council of Forty and the Council of Ten, responsible for judicial matters, and the Senate.

==Etymology==
During its long history, the Republic of Venice took on various names, all closely linked to the titles attributed to the doge. During the 8th century, when Venice still depended on the Byzantine Empire, the doge was called in Latin (&#x27;Doge of the Province of Venice&#x27;), and then, starting from 840, (&#x27;Doge of the Venetians&#x27;), following the signing of the . This commercial agreement, stipulated between the Duchy of Venice () and the Carolingian Empire, &quot;de facto&quot; ratified the independence of Venice from the Byzantine Empire.

In the following century, references to Venice as a Byzantine dominion disappeared, and in a document from 976 there is a mention of the most glorious (&#x27;Lord of Venice&#x27;), where the &#x27;most glorious&#x27; appellative had already been used for the first time in the and where the appellative &quot;lord&quot; refers to the fact that the doge was still considered like a king, even if elected by the popular assembly. Gaining independence, Venice also began to expand on the coasts of the Adriatic Sea, and so starting from 1109, following the conquest of Dalmatia and the Croatian coast, the doge formally received the title of (&#x27;Doge of Venice, Dalmatia and Croatia&#x27;), a name that continued to be used until the 18th century. Starting from the 15th century, the documents written in Latin were joined by those in the Venetian language, and in parallel with the events in Italy, the Duchy of Venice also changed its name, becoming the Lordship of Venice, which as written in the peace treaty of 1453 with Sultan Mehmed II was fully named the (&#x27;The Most Illustrious and Excellent Signoria of Venice&#x27;).

During the 17th century, monarchical absolutism asserted itself in many countries of continental Europe, radically changing the European political landscape. This change made it possible to more markedly determine the differences between monarchies and republics: while the former had economies governed by strict laws and dominated by agriculture, the latter lived off of commercial affairs and free markets. Moreover, the monarchies, in addition to being led by a single ruling family, were more prone to war and religious uniformity. This increasingly noticeable difference between monarchy and republic began to be specified also in official documents, and it was hence that names such as the Republic of Genoa or the Republic of the Seven United Provinces were born. The Lordship of Venice also adapted to this new terminology, becoming the Most Serene Republic of Venice (; ), a name by which it is best known today. Similarly, the doge was also given the nickname of or more simply that of &quot;His Serenity&quot;. From the 17th century the Republic of Venice took on other more or less official names such as the Venetian State or the Venetian Republic. The republic is often referred to as &quot;La Serenissima&quot;, in reference to its title as one of the &quot;Most Serene Republics&quot;.

==History==

===9th–10th century: The ducal age===
The Duchy of Venice was born in the 9th century from the Byzantine territories of Maritime Venice. According to tradition, the first doge was elected in 697, but this figure is of dubious historicity and comparable to that of the exarch Paul, who, similarly to the doge, was assassinated in 727 following a revolt. Father Pietro Antonio of Venetia, in his history of the lagoon city published in 1688, writes: &quot;The precise time in which that family arrived in the Adria is not found, but rather, what already an inhabitant of the islands, by the princes, who welcomed citizens, and supported with the advantage of significant riches, in the year 697 she contributed to the nomination of the first Prince Marco Contarini, one of the 22 Tribunes of the Islands, who made the election&quot;. In 726, Emperor Leo III attempted to extend iconoclasm to the Exarchate of Ravenna, causing numerous revolts throughout the territory. In reaction to the reform, the local populations appointed several &quot;duces&quot; to replace the Byzantine governors and in particular &quot;Venetia&quot; appointed Orso as its doge, who governed the lagoon for a decade. Following his death, the Byzantines entrusted the government of the province to the regime of the &quot;magistri militum&quot;, which lasted until 742 when the emperor granted the people the appointment of a &quot;dux&quot;. The Venetians elected by acclamation Theodato, son of Orso, who decided to move the capital of the duchy from &quot;Heraclia&quot; to &quot;Metamauco&quot;.

The Lombard conquest of Ravenna in 751 and the subsequent conquest of the Lombard kingdom by Charlemagne&#x27;s Franks in 774, with the creation of the Carolingian Empire in 800, considerably changed the geopolitical context of the lagoon, leading the Venetians to divide into two factions : a pro-Frankish party led by the city of &quot;Equilium&quot; and a pro-Byzantine party with a stronghold in &quot;Heraclia&quot;. After a long series of skirmishes in 805, Doge Obelerio decided to attack both cities simultaneously, deporting their population to the capital. Having taken control of the situation, the doge placed &quot;Venezia&quot; under Frankish protection, but a Byzantine naval blockade convinced him to renew his loyalty to the Eastern Emperor. With the intention of conquering &quot;Venezia&quot; in 810, the Frankish army commanded by Pepin invaded the lagoon, forcing the local population to retreat to &quot;Rivoalto&quot;, thus starting a siege which ended with the arrival of the Byzantine fleet and the retreat of the Franks. Following the failed Frankish conquest, Doge Obelerio was replaced by the pro-Byzantine nobleman Agnello Participazio who definitively moved the capital to &quot;Rivoalto&quot; in 812, thus decreeing the birth of the city of Venice.

With his election, Agnello Partecipazio attempted to make the ducal office hereditary by associating an heir, the &quot;co-dux&quot;, with the throne. The system brought Agnello&#x27;s two sons, Giustiniano and Giovanni, to the ducal position, who was deposed in 836 due to his inadequacy to counter the Narentine pirates in Dalmatia. Following the deposition of Giovanni Partecipazio, Pietro Tradonico was elected who, with the promulgation of the &quot;Pactum Lotharii&quot;, a commercial treaty between Venice and the Carolingian Empire, began the long process of detachment of the province from the Byzantine Empire. After Tradonico was killed following a conspiracy in 864, Orso I Participazio was elected and resumed the fight against piracy, managing to protect the &quot;Dogado&quot; from attacks by the Saracens and the Patriarchate of Aquileia. Orso managed to assign the dukedom to his eldest son Giovanni II Participazio who, after conquering Comacchio, a rival city of Venice in the salt trade, decided to abdicate in favor of his brother, at the time patriarch of Grado, who refused. Since there was no heir in 887 the people gathered in the &quot;Concio&quot; and elected Pietro I Candiano by acclamation.

The &quot;Concio&quot; managed to elect six doges up to Pietro III Candiano who in 958 assigned the position of &quot;co-dux&quot; to his son Pietro who became doge the following year. Due to his land holdings, Pietro IV Candiano had a political vision close to that of the Holy Roman Empire and consequently attempted to establish feudalism in Venice as well, causing a revolt in 976 which led to the burning of the capital and the killing of the doge. These events led the Venetian patriciate to gain a growing influence on the doge&#x27;s policies and the conflicts that arose following the doge&#x27;s assassination were resolved only in 991 with the election of Pietro II Orseolo.

===11th–12th century: Relations with the Byzantine Empire===

Pietro II Orseolo gave a notable boost to Venetian commercial expansion by stipulating new commercial privileges with the Holy Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire. In addition to diplomacy, the doge resumed the war against the Narentan pirates that began in the 9th century and in the year 1000 he managed to subjugate the coastal cities of Istria and Dalmatia. The Great Schism of 1054 and the outbreak of the investiture struggle in 1073 marginally involved Venetian politics which instead focused its attention on the arrival of the Normans in southern Italy. The Norman occupation of Durrës and Corfu in 1081 pushed the Byzantine Empire to request the aid of the Venetian fleet which, with the promise of obtaining extensive commercial privileges and reimbursement of military expenses, decided to take part in the Byzantine-Norman wars. The following year, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granted Venice the chrysobol, a commercial privilege that allowed Venetian merchants substantial tax exemptions in numerous Byzantine ports and the establishment of a Venetian neighbourhood in Durrës and Constantinople. The war ended in 1085 when, following the death of the leader Robert Guiscard, the Norman army abandoned its positions to return to Puglia.

Having taken office in 1118, Emperor John II Komnenos decided not to renew the chrysobol of 1082, arousing the reaction of Venice which declared war on the Byzantine Empire in 1122. The war ended in 1126 with the victory of Venice which forced the emperor to stipulate a new agreement characterized by even better conditions than the previous ones, thus making the Byzantine Empire totally dependent on Venetian trade and protection. With the intention of weakening the growing Venetian power, the emperor provided substantial commercial support to the maritime republics of Ancona, Genoa and Pisa, making coexistence with Venice, which was now hegemonic on the Adriatic Sea, increasingly difficult, so much so that it was renamed the &quot;Gulf of Venice&quot;. In 1171, following the emperor&#x27;s decision to expel the Venetian merchants from Constantinople, a new war broke out which was resolved with the restoration of the &quot;status quo&quot;. At the end of the 12th century, the commercial traffic of Venetian merchants extended throughout the East and they could count on immense and solid capital.

As in the rest of Italy, starting from the 12th century, Venice also underwent the transformations that led to the age of the municipalities. In that century, the doge&#x27;s power began to decline: initially supported only by a few judges, in 1130 it was decided to place the &quot;Consilium Sapientium&quot;, which would later become the Great Council of Venice, alongside his power. In the same period, in addition to the expulsion of the clergy from public life, new assemblies such as the Council of Forty and the Minor Council were established and in his inauguration speech the Doge was forced to declare loyalty to the Republic with the &quot;promissione ducale&quot;; thus the Commune of Venice, the set of all the assemblies aimed at regulating the power of the doge, began to take shape.

===13th–14th century: The Crusades and the rivalry with Genoa===

In the 12th century, Venice decided not to participate in the Crusades due to its commercial interests in the East and instead concentrated on maintaining its possessions in Dalmatia which were repeatedly besieged by the Hungarians. The situation changed in 1202 when the Doge Enrico Dandolo decided to exploit the expedition of the Fourth Crusade to conclude the Zara War and the following year, after twenty years of conflict, Venice conquered the city and won the war, regaining control of Dalmatia. The Venetian crusader fleet, however, did not stop in Dalmatia, but continued towards Constantinople to besiege it in 1204, thus putting an end to the Byzantine Empire and formally making Venice an independent state, severing the last ties with the former Byzantine ruler. The empire was dismembered in the Crusader states and from the division Venice obtained numerous ports in the Morea and several islands in the Aegean Sea including Crete and Euboea, thus giving life to the &quot;Stato da Màr&quot;. In addition to the territorial conquests, the doge was awarded the title of Lord of a quarter and a half of the Eastern Roman Empire, thus obtaining the faculty of appointing the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople and the possibility of sending a Venetian representative to the government of the Eastern Latin Empire. With the end of the Fourth Crusade, Venice concentrated its efforts on the conquest of Crete, which intensely involved the Venetian army until 1237.

Venice&#x27;s control over the eastern trade routes became pressing and this caused an increase in conflicts with Genoa which in 1255 exploded into the War of Saint Sabas; on 24 June 1258 the two republics faced each other in the Battle of Acre which ended with an overwhelming Venetian victory. In 1261 the Empire of Nicaea with the help of the Republic of Genoa managed to dissolve the Eastern Latin Empire and re-establish the Byzantine Empire. The war between Genoa and Venice resumed and after a long series of battles the war ended in 1270 with the Peace of Cremona. In 1281 Venice defeated the Republic of Ancona in battle and in 1293 a new war between Genoa, the Byzantine Empire and Venice broke out, won by the Genoese following the Battle of Curzola and ending in 1299.

During the war, various administrative reforms were implemented in Venice, new assemblies were established to replace popular ones such as the Senate and in the Great Council power began to concentrate in the hands of about ten families. To avoid the birth of a lordship, the Doge decided to increase the number of members of the Maggior Consiglio while leaving the number of families unchanged and so the Serrata del Maggior Consiglio was implemented in 1297. Following the provision, the power of some of the old houses decreased and in 1310, under the pretext of defeat in the War of Ferrara, these families organized themselves in the Tiepolo conspiracy. Once the coup d&#x27;état failed and the establishment of a lordship was averted, Doge Pietro Gradenigo established the Council of Ten, which was assigned the task of repressing any threat to the security of the state.

In the Venetian hinterland, the war waged by Mastino II della Scala caused serious economic losses to Venetian trade, so in 1336 Venice gave birth to the anti-Scaliger league and the Scaliger War. The following year the coalition expanded further and Padua returned to the dominion of the Carraresi. In 1338, Venice conquered Treviso, the first nucleus of the &quot;Domini di Terraferma&quot;, and in 1339 it signed a peace treaty in which the Scaligeri promised not to interfere in Venetian trade and to recognize the sovereignty of Venice over the Trevisan March.

In 1343 Venice took part in the Smyrniote crusades, but its participation was suspended due to the siege of Zadar by the Hungarians. The Genoese expansion to the east, which caused the Black Death, brought the rivalry between the two republics to resurface and in 1350 they faced each other in the War of the Straits. Following the defeat in the Battle of Sapienza, Doge Marino Faliero attempted to establish a city lordship, but the coup d&#x27;état was foiled by the Council of Ten which on 17 April 1355 condemned the Doge to death. The ensuing political instability convinced Louis I of Hungary to attack Dalmatia which was conquered in 1358 with the signing of the Treaty of Zadar. The weakness of the Republic pushed Crete and Trieste to revolt, but the rebellions were quelled, thus reaffirming Venetian dominion over the &quot;Stato da Màr&quot;. The skirmishes between the Venetians and the Genoese resumed and in 1378 the two republics faced each other in the War of Chioggia. Initially the Genoese managed to conquer Chioggia and vast areas of the Venetian Lagoon, but in the end it was the Venetians who prevailed; the war ended definitively on 8 August 1381 with the Treaty of Turin which sanctioned the exit of the Genoese from the competition for dominion over the Mediterranean.

===15th century: Territorial expansion===

In 1403, the last major battle between the Genoese (now under French rule) and Venice was fought at Modon, and the final victory resulted in maritime hegemony and dominance of the eastern trade routes. The latter would soon be contested, however, by the inexorable rise of the Ottoman Empire. Hostilities began after Prince Mehmed I ended the civil war of the Ottoman Interregnum and established himself as sultan. The conflict escalated until Pietro Loredan won a crushing victory against the Turks off Gallipoli in 1416.

Venice expanded as well along the Dalmatian coast from Istria to Albania, which was acquired from King Ladislaus of Naples during the civil war in Hungary. Ladislaus was about to lose the conflict and had decided to escape to Naples, but before doing so he agreed to sell his now practically forfeit rights on the Dalmatian cities for the reduced sum of 100,000 ducats. Venice exploited the situation and quickly installed nobility to govern the area, for example, Count Filippo Stipanov in Zara. This move by the Venetians was a response to the threatening expansion of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. Control over the northeast main land routes was also a necessity for the safety of the trades. By 1410, Venice had a navy of 3,300 ships (manned by 36,000 men) and had taken over most of what is now the Veneto, including the cities of Verona (which swore its loyalty in the Devotion of Verona to Venice in 1405) and Padua.

Slaves were plentiful in the Italian city-states as late as the 15th century. The Venetian slave trade was divided in to the Balkan slave trade and the Black Sea slave trade. Between 1414 and 1423, some 10,000 slaves, imported from Caffa (via the Black Sea slave trade), were sold in Venice. 
In the early 15th century, the republic began to expand onto the &quot;Terraferma.&quot; Thus, Vicenza, Belluno, and Feltre were acquired in 1404, and Padua, Verona, and Este in 1405. The situation in Dalmatia had been settled in 1408 by a truce with King Sigismund of Hungary, but the difficulties of Hungary finally granted to the republic the consolidation of its Adriatic dominions. The situation culminated in the Battle of Motta in late August 1412, when an invading army of Hungarians, Germans and Croats, led by Pippo Spano and Voivode Miklós Marczali attacked the Venetian positions at Motta and suffered a heavy defeat. At the expiration of the truce in 1420, Venice immediately invaded the Patriarchate of Aquileia and subjected Traù, Spalato, Durazzo, and other Dalmatian cities. In Lombardy, Venice acquired Brescia in 1426, Bergamo in 1428, and Cremona in 1499.

In 1454, a conspiracy for a rebellion against Venice was dismantled in Candia. The conspiracy was led by Sifis Vlastos as an opposition to the religious reforms for the unification of Churches agreed at the Council of Florence. In 1481, Venice retook nearby Rovigo, which it had held previously from 1395 to 1438.

The Ottoman Empire started sea campaigns as early as 1423, when it waged a seven-year war with the Venetian Republic over maritime control of the Aegean, the Ionian, and the Adriatic Seas. The wars with Venice resumed after the Ottomans captured the Kingdom of Bosnia in 1463, and lasted until a favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479 just after the troublesome siege of Shkodra. In 1480, no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet, the Ottomans besieged Rhodes and briefly captured Otranto.

In February 1489, the island of Cyprus, previously a crusader state (the Kingdom of Cyprus), was added to Venice&#x27;s holdings. By 1490, the population of Venice had risen to about 180,000 people.

===16th century: League of Cambrai, the loss of Cyprus, and Battle of Lepanto===

War with the Ottomans resumed from 1499 to 1503. In 1499, Venice allied itself with Louis XII of France against Milan, gaining Cremona. In the same year, the Ottoman sultan moved to attack Lepanto by land and sent a large fleet to support his offensive by sea. Antonio Grimani, more a businessman and diplomat than a sailor, was defeated in the sea battle of Zonchio in 1499. The Turks once again sacked Friuli. Preferring peace to total war both against the Turks and by sea, Venice surrendered the bases of Lepanto, Durazzo, Modon, and Coron.

Venice&#x27;s attention was diverted from its usual maritime position by the delicate situation in Romagna, then one of the richest lands in Italy, which was nominally part of the Papal States, but effectively divided into a series of small lordships which were difficult for Rome&#x27;s troops to control. Eager to take some of Venice&#x27;s lands, all neighbouring powers joined in the League of Cambrai in 1508, under the leadership of Pope Julius II. The pope wanted Romagna; Emperor Maximilian I: Friuli and Veneto; Spain: the Apulian ports; the king of France: Cremona; the king of Hungary: Dalmatia, and each one some of another&#x27;s part. The offensive against the huge army enlisted by Venice was launched from France.

On 14 May 1509, Venice was crushingly defeated at the battle of Agnadello, in the Ghiara d&#x27;Adda, marking one of the most delicate points in Venetian history. French and imperial troops were occupying Veneto, but Venice managed to extricate itself through diplomatic efforts. The Apulian ports were ceded to come to terms with Spain, and Julius II soon recognized the danger brought by the eventual destruction of Venice (then the only Italian power able to face kingdoms like France or empires like the Ottomans).

The citizens of the mainland rose to the cry of &quot;Marco, Marco&quot;, and Andrea Gritti recaptured Padua in July 1509, successfully defending it against the besieging imperial troops. Spain and the pope broke off their alliance with France, and Venice regained Brescia and Verona from France, also. After seven years of ruinous war, the Serenissima regained its mainland dominions west to the Adda River. Although the defeat had turned into a victory, the events of 1509 marked the end of the Venetian expansion.

In 1489, the first year of Venetian control of Cyprus, Turks attacked the Karpasia Peninsula, pillaging and taking captives to be sold into slavery. In 1539, the Turkish fleet attacked and destroyed Limassol. Fearing the ever-expanding Ottoman Empire, the Venetians had fortified Famagusta, Nicosia, and Kyrenia, but most other cities were easy prey. By 1563, the population of Venice had dropped to about 168,000 people.

In the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again but this time with a full-scale invasion rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of Mustafa Pasha landed unopposed near Limassol on 2 July 1570 and laid siege to Nicosia. In an orgy of victory on the day that the city fell – 9 September 1570 – 20,000 Nicosians were put to death, and every church, public building, and palace was looted. Word of the massacre spread, and a few days later, Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. Famagusta, however, resisted and put up a defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571.

The fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. Two months later, the naval forces of the Holy League, composed mainly of Venetian, Spanish, and papal ships under the command of Don John of Austria, defeated the Turkish fleet at the battle of Lepanto. Despite victory at sea over the Turks, Cyprus remained under Ottoman rule for the next three centuries. By 1575, the population of Venice was about 175,000 people, but partly as a result of the plague of 1575–76 the population dropped to 124,000 people by 1581.

===17th century===

According to economic historian Jan De Vries, Venice&#x27;s economic power in the Mediterranean had declined significantly by the start of the 17th century. De Vries attributes this decline to the loss of the spice trade, a declining uncompetitive textile industry, competition in book publishing from a rejuvenated Catholic Church, the adverse impact of the Thirty Years&#x27; War on Venice&#x27;s key trade partners, and the increasing cost of cotton and silk imports to Venice.

In 1606, a conflict between Venice and the Holy See began with the arrest of two clerics accused of petty crimes and with a law restricting the Church&#x27;s right to enjoy and acquire landed property. Pope Paul V held that these provisions were contrary to canon law, and demanded that they be repealed. When this was refused, he placed Venice under an interdict which forbade clergymen from exercising almost all priestly duties. The republic paid no attention to the interdict or the act of excommunication and ordered its priests to carry out their ministry. It was supported in its decisions by the Servite friar Paolo Sarpi, a sharp polemical writer who was nominated to be the Signoria&#x27;s adviser on theology and canon law in 1606. The interdict was lifted after a year, when France intervened and proposed a formula of compromise. Venice was satisfied with reaffirming the principle that no citizen was superior to the normal processes of law.

Rivalry with Habsburg Spain and the Holy Roman Empire led to Venice&#x27;s last significant wars in Italy and the northern Adriatic. Between 1615 and 1618 Venice fought Archduke Ferdinand of Austria in the Uskok War in the northern Adriatic and on the Republic&#x27;s eastern border, while in Lombardy to the west, Venetian troops skirmished with the forces of Don Pedro de Toledo Osorio, Spanish governor of Milan, around Crema in 1617 and in the countryside of Romano di Lombardia in 1618. During the same period, the Spanish governor of Naples, Don Pedro Téllez-Girón, clashed against Venice for commercial disputes at the battle of Ragusa, having previously indirectly supported Ferdinand during the Uskok War.

A fragile peace did not last, and in 1629 the Most Serene Republic returned to war with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire in the War of the Mantuan Succession. During the brief war a Venetian army led by provveditore Zaccaria Sagredo and reinforced by French allies was disastrously routed by Imperial forces at the battle of Villabuona, and Venice&#x27;s closest ally Mantua was sacked. Reversals elsewhere for the Holy Roman Empire and Spain ensured the republic suffered no territorial loss, and the duchy of Mantua was restored to Charles II Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers, who was the candidate backed by Venice and France.

The latter half of the 17th century also had prolonged wars with the Ottoman Empire; in the Cretan War (1645–1669), after a heroic siege that lasted 21 years, Venice lost its major overseas possessionthe island of Crete (although it kept the control of the bases of Spinalonga and Suda)while it made some advances in Dalmatia. In 1684, however, taking advantage of the Ottoman involvement against Austria in the Great Turkish War, the republic initiated the Morean War, which lasted until 1699 and in which it was able to conquer the Morea peninsula in southern Greece.

===18th century: Decline===


These gains did not last, however; in December 1714, the Turks began the last Turkish–Venetian War, when the Morea was &quot;without any of those supplies which are so desirable even in countries where aid is near at hand which are not liable to attack from the sea&quot;.

The Turks took the islands of Tinos and Aegina, crossed the isthmus, and took Corinth. Daniele Dolfin, commander of the Venetian fleet, thought it better to save the fleet than risk it for the Morea. When he eventually arrived on the scene, Nauplia, Modon, Corone, and Malvasia had fallen. Levkas in the Ionian islands, and the bases of Spinalonga and Suda on Crete, which still remained in Venetian hands, were abandoned. The Turks finally landed on Corfu, but its defenders managed to throw them back.

In the meantime, the Turks had suffered a grave defeat by the Austrians in the Battle of Petrovaradin on 5 August 1716. Venetian naval efforts in the Aegean Sea and the Dardanelles in 1717 and 1718, however, met with little success. With the Treaty of Passarowitz (21 July 1718), Austria made large territorial gains, but Venice lost the Morea, for which its small gains in Albania and Dalmatia were little compensation. This was the last war with the Ottoman Empire. By the year 1792, the once-great Venetian merchant fleet had declined to a mere 309 merchantmen. Although Venice declined as a seaborne empire, it remained in possession of its continental domain north of the Po Valley, extending west almost to Milan. Many of its cities benefited greatly from the &quot;Pax Venetiae&quot; (Venetian peace) throughout the 18th century.

Angelo Emo was named the last Captain General of the Sea (Capitano Generale da Mar) of the Republic in 1784.

===Fall===

By 1796, the Republic of Venice could no longer defend itself since its war fleet numbered only four galleys and seven galiots. In spring 1796, Piedmont (the Duchy of Savoy) fell to the invading French, and the Austrians were beaten from Montenotte to Lodi. The army under Napoleon crossed the frontiers of neutral Venice in pursuit of the enemy. By the end of the year, the French troops were occupying the Venetian state up to the Adige River. Vicenza, Cadore and Friuli were held by the Austrians. With the campaigns of the next year, Napoleon aimed for the Austrian possessions across the Alps. In the preliminaries to the Peace of Leoben, the terms of which remained secret, the Austrians were to take the Venetian possessions in the Balkans as the price of peace (18 April 1797) while France acquired the Lombard part of the state.

After Napoleon&#x27;s ultimatum, Ludovico Manin surrendered unconditionally on 12 May and abdicated, while the Major Council declared the end of the republic. According to Bonaparte&#x27;s orders, the public powers passed to a provisional municipality under the French military governor. On 17 October, France and Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio, agreeing to share all the territory of the republic, with a new border just west of the Adige. Italian democrats, especially young poet Ugo Foscolo, viewed the treaty as a betrayal. The metropolitan part of the disbanded republic became an Austrian territory, under the name of Venetian Province ( in Italian, in German).

===Legacy===
Though the economic vitality of the Venetian Republic had started to decline since the 16th century with the movement of international trade towards the Atlantic, its political regime still appeared in the 18th century as a model for the philosophers of the Enlightenment.

Jean-Jacques Rousseau was hired in July 1743 as secretary by Comte de Montaigu, who had been named ambassador of the French in Venice. This short experience, nevertheless, awakened the interest of Rousseau to the policy, which led him to design a large book of political philosophy. After the &quot;Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men&quot; (1755), he published &quot;The Social Contract&quot; (1762).

==Politics==

Following the Lombard occupation and the progressive migration of the Roman populations, new coastal settlements were born in which the local assemblies, the &quot;comitia&quot;, elected a Tribune to govern the local administration, perpetuating the Roman custom started in the last years of the Western Roman Empire. Between the end of the 7th century and the beginning of the 8th, a new political reform affected Venetia: like the other Byzantine provinces of Italy it was transformed into a duchy, at the head of which was the doge. Following the brief regime of the &quot;magistri militum&quot;, in 742 ducal electivity was transferred from the Empire to local assemblies, thus sanctioning the beginning of the ducal monarchy which lasted, with ups and downs, until the 11th century.

If the first stable form of involvement of the patriciate in the management of power occurred with the institution of the &quot;curia ducis&quot;, starting from 1141 with the beginning of the municipal age, an unstoppable process of limitation and removal of ducal power from part of the nascent mercantile aristocracy gathered in the Great Council, the largest assembly of the Veneciarum municipality. In the 13th century the popular assembly of the &quot;concio&quot; was progressively stripped of all its powers and, similarly to the Italian city lordships, in Venice too power began to concentrate in the hands of a small number of families. To avoid the birth of a lordship and dilute the power of the old houses, the Lockout of the Great Council took place in 1297, a measure that increased the number of members of the Great Council leaving the number of families unchanged and therefore precluding the entry of the new nobility.

Between the 13th and 14th centuries the power of the doge became purely formal and that of the popular assemblies null and void, even if the tannery was formally abolished only in 1423; this decreed the birth of an oligarchic and aristocratic republic which continued to exist until the fall of the Republic. The organization of the state was entrusted to many nobles divided into numerous assemblies which generally remained in office for less than a year and met in Venice in the Doge&#x27;s Palace, the political center of the Republic.

===Government system===
====Doge====


The Doge (from the Latin &quot;dux&quot;, or commander) was the head of state of the Republic of Venice, the position lasted for life and his name appeared on coins, ducal bulls, judicial sentences and letters sent to foreign governments. His greatest power was to promulgate laws; he also commanded the army during periods of war and had the Sopragastaldo execute all judicial sentences in his name. The election of the Doge was decreed by an assembly of forty-one electors chosen after a long series of elections and lots, to avoid fraud, and once elected the Doge had the obligation to pronounce the &quot;promissione ducale&quot;, an oath in which was promised loyalty to the Republic and the limitations to its powers were recognized.

The Signoria was the most dignified assembly of the Venetian governmental system and was composed of the Doge, the Minor Council and the three leaders of the Quarantia Criminale. The Signoria had the fundamental task of presiding over the major assemblies of the state: the College of the Wise, the Great Council, the Senate and the Council of Ten. The members of the Signoria also had the power to propose and vote on laws in the presided over assemblies and to convene the Great Council at any time. The Minor Council was elected by the Major Council and was made up of six councilors elected three at a time every eight months; since they remained in office for one year, the three outgoing councilors played the role of Inferior Councilors for four months and presided over the Quarantia Criminale representing the Signoria. Within the Minor Council one of the Three State Inquisitors was elected and following the death of the Doge it elected a Deputy Doge and presided over the Republic with the rest of the Signoria.

Over the centuries, 120 doges followed one another in Venice. Among the most illustrious names are:
*Paolo Lucio Anafesto, the first Doge of Venice.
*Pietro II Orseolo, who established Venetian dominion over the Adriatic and conquered Dalmatia.
*Enrico Dandolo, who led the Republic of Venice to domination over the Byzantine Empire, giving rise to Venice&#x27;s maritime empire.
*Marino Faliero, who was beheaded for attempting to found a Lordship.
*Francesco Foscari, who expanded the dominions of the Republic into the mainland.
*Leonardo Loredan, who led Venice in resistance against the League of Cambrai, the coalition of the most important European states against Venice.
*Francesco Morosini, who led Venice in the recovery of Morea (the Peloponnese), the last great redemption of the Republic against the Turks.
*Ludovico Manin, the last Doge of Venice.

====College of the Sages====

The College of the Sages was composed of three subcommissions called &quot;hands&quot;: the Sages of the Council, the Sages of the Mainland and the Sages of the Orders, it constituted the summit of the executive power, was elected by the Senate and when it was presided over by the Signoria it took the name of Full College. There were six Sages of the Council and they established the agenda of the work of the Senate while the Sages of the Orders, initially responsible for the management of the mude and the navy, progressively lost importance. The Sages of the Mainland were five, one was the Sage of the Ceremonials, one the Sage who dealt with the dispatch of the laws, while the other three were proper ministers:
*The Sage of the Finances, analogous to the finance minister, was superior and close collaborator of the &quot;camerlenghi&quot;;
*The Sage of the Scripture, analogous to the minister of war, was in charge of the economic management of the troops and military justice;
*The Sage of the Ordinances, was responsible for the management of the Cernida, the local defense militias.

The Full College had as its primary function that of maintaining relations with foreign states and with the Church, it welcomed ambassadors, nuncios of subject cities and members of the clergy.

====Great Council====
The Great Council was made up of all noble men of at least twenty-five years of age registered in the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot; and held legislative and elective power. Initially made up of around four hundred members, its size increased considerably following the Lockout of the Great Council, so much so that in the 16th century 2,095 nobles participated in a session and in 1527 those entitled to sit reached 2,746. Each member of the Great Council was allowed to vote and propose a new law which then had to be approved by the Council itself, which was also responsible for reforming and repealing the laws. While the legislative power was mostly held by the Senate, the elective power was almost exclusive to the Great Council. The council elected eighty-four magistracies including: the Minor Council, the Senate, the Council of Forty, the Council of Ten, the grand chancellor and the Avogadoria de Comùn as well as all the captains, the podestà, the &quot;provveditori&quot;, the camerlenghi and indirectly the Doge.

====Concio====

The &quot;Concio&quot; was a general assembly of ordinary free citizens and patricians, excluding slaves. It varied drastically in power over the course of its history, holding at times essentially all and essentially no power. 

====Principal magistrates====
;Senate
:Also known as the Council of &quot;Pregadi&quot;, the Senate primarily held legislative power. Made up of around 300 members over thirty-five years of age, 120 were senators elected by the Great Council (60 plus 60 &quot;de zonta&quot;) to which were added the Council of Ten, the Council of Forty, the College of the Sages and many other magistracies which often held exclusive power to vote or propose laws. The Senate was responsible for legislating mainly on financial, commercial and foreign policies.
;Council of Forty
:The Council of Forty was the body that held maximum judicial power. It was divided into: Quarantia Criminale for criminal trials, Quarantia Civil Vecchia and Quarantia Civil Nuova for civil trials in the &quot;Dogado&quot; and the Mainland Dominions and into two panels of fifteen and twenty-five members for cases of minor importance. Each of the Quarantie was made up of forty members which, added to those of the colleges, made 160 members. The judges rotated starting from the colleges and then arriving at the Quarantia Criminale and worked for eight months in each assembly, remaining in office for two years and eight months.
;Avogadoria de Comùn
:Similar to today&#x27;s public prosecutor, the Avogadoria de Comùn represented the interests of the community and the state. The advocates remained in office for sixteen months and were also responsible for drawing up the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot; in which all those entitled to sit on the Great Council were registered.
;Council of Ten
:A special state security agency created following the Tiepolo conspiracy, it was made up of ten members who had the aim of guaranteeing the security of the Republic and its government through any means. The Council acted as a court with jurisdiction over state security matters; its power was so broad that in 1355 it even condemned the Doge Marino Faliero to death. Having such broad power, the position lasted only one year and furthermore the ten could not exercise other public functions and had no family ties between them. To guarantee the secrecy of its actions, the Council was entrusted with a sum of money which it administered independently. The Three State Inquisitors, who could replace ordinary judges and proceeded in secret, had greater power within the body.

===Administrative subdivisions===

The fundamental administrative subdivision of the Republic of Venice was the regiment, a small territory administered by a podestà, to which a city was headed. The regiments were born only in the first half of the 15th century via the mechanism of dedications. The Republic required the deposition of the lord who was promptly replaced with a rector, after which the city&#x27;s ambassadors went to Venice where the city&#x27;s indissoluble bond with the Republic was defined. Because of this mechanism, the Republic of Venice managed to incorporate many territories.

To govern the most important regiments in an impartial and effective way, the podestà was chosen from among the members of the Venetian patriciate, while in secondary regiments the rector was often chosen from among the local nobility. Despite this, the laws and administration varied greatly based on the peculiarities of the regiment itself. The Republic therefore left a lot of freedom of government to the podestà, though at the end of their mandate, after a maximum of four years, the podestà was obliged to deliver a report on their administration.

The podestà, who depending on the territory administered was also called rector, bailo, count or governor, in larger regiments was also assisted by two councilors and other administrators. The army and police were under the command of the Captain while the borders were supervised by the Castellani, the Chancellors administered justice while finance was managed by the Camerlenghi. The superintendent generals acted above the podestàs and, in addition to having the power to choose the rectors in case of danger, were normally involved in supervising the podestàs by sending supervisors called sindi inquisitors.

The regiments ultimately formed three administrative regions:
;&quot;Dogado&quot;
:The &quot;Dogado&quot; was the original territory of the Republic. It included Venice and its lagoon which was divided into nine districts. Each district was governed by a patrician with the title of podestà and the district cities were: Caorle, Torcello, Murano, Malamocco, Chioggia, Loreo, Cavarzere and Gambarare, while the city of Grado was administered by a count. Initially extending along the entire Venetian coast from Grado to Cavarzere, it progressively moved its southern border up to Goro, along the Po Delta; the extension on the mainland was limited to between 7 and 19 kilometers.
;&quot;Stato da Màr&quot;
:The &quot;Domini del Mare&quot;, called &quot;Stato da Mar&quot; in the Venetian language, were made up of the overseas territories conquered by the Republic of Venice. The regiments of the &quot;Stato da Mar&quot; reported to the &quot;Provveditore Generale da Mar&quot; who lived on the island of Corfu. During their expansion, the Venetians established a series of dominions throughout the Eastern Mediterranean that went from Istria to Dalmatia, also including Albania and the Ionian Islands. Further east, the Republic conquered a large part of Greece, in particular the Cyclades, the Peloponnese and Negroponte, as well as the large islands of Crete and Cyprus. In addition to the territories directly dominated by Venice, the &quot;Stato da Mar&quot; also included various feudal lordships governed by the major noble families of the time. These lordships corresponded to the various Aegean Islands, but were also established in Athens and Gallipoli.
;&quot;Stato da Tera&quot;
:The &quot;Domini di Terraferma&quot;, called &quot;Stato da Tera&quot; in the Venetian language, were made up of the territories of northern Italy conquered by the Republic of Venice, where in the event of war the command of the armies was assumed by the Superintendent General of Arms. The mainland possessions were the territories of Padovano, Marca, Vicenza, Veronese, Bresciano, Bergamasco, Cremonese, Friuli, Polesine and Cadore.

===Armed forces and public security===
====Navy====


The navy was the main armed force of the Republic for centuries, at least until the 15th century when it was also supported by a land army. The fleet was administered by the Magistrate of the Militia of the Sea, a sort of ministry composed of different magistracies that divided the tasks of governing the preparation of the fleet, weapons and crews. The preparation of the fleet was administered by the supervisors of the Venetian Arsenal, the key structure of the Venetian navy. In this extensive complex of workshops and shipyards, ships were built and armed. The Arsenal also contained several schools in which personnel were trained, also with the help of French and English workers, to make the construction of ships and vessels more efficient and of higher quality. The preparation of the fleet was decided by the armament supervisors who took care of the maintenance of the decommissioned ships and the assignment of the soldiers and rowers. The recruitment operations for sailors were instead carried out by the presidents of the Militia of the Sea, who following the War of Candia began to recruit personnel from abroad and not only from the territory of the Republic.

The fleet located in the &quot;Stato da Màr&quot; was managed by the Superintendent General of the Sea, who resided in Corfu and in the overseas dominions was also head of the army and administration. In wartime, command passed to the Captain General of the Sea, who was immediately elected and who had more extensive powers than the Superintendent General. The fleet was divided into a small army and a large army. The thin army was made up of galleys and galleasses and the admirals in command, all patricians, had different degrees of specialisation; for example there were those responsible for navigating rivers and lakes, those dedicated to the war against piracy and those dedicated to surveillance of the islands. The large army, made up of warships, was managed in wartime by the Commissioner in the Army and the command of the ships was assigned to naval officers who did not belong to the Veneto patricians. Until the end of the 16th century the large armada was also used for the defense of commercial ships.

====Army====
In the 15th century, the expansion and conquest of the mainland made it necessary to resort to venture companies and mercenaries to be able to equip themselves with land forces. The organization of the troops and mercenaries was managed by a set of supervisors who were coordinated by the Inquisitors above the roles, presided over by the Sages of the Mainland, who were responsible for reporting and managing the troops and their equipment. In the 16th century, the Cernide were established, territorial militias managed by the Rector of the regiment and made up of around a hundred men dedicated to the defense of land and maritime possessions, where they took the name of &quot;craine&quot;; they were managed by Savio ai Ordini. In wartime, the armies were coordinated by the Captain General of the Mainland, usually an expert mercenary who was supported by the Superintendent General and who took orders from the Sage of Scripture or the Minister of War.

====Police====
The order of the city of Venice was managed by a police force coordinated by the six Lords of the Night who had the power to arrest criminals both day and night. In addition to the Lords of the Night, the district leaders also patrolled the streets. However, the order was also managed by a various number of supervisors. Crimes such as rape and blasphemy were regulated by the perpetrators of blasphemy who also took care of the control of brothels, the pump supervisors instead controlled the excesses of the nobles while the magistrates controlled health and the healthiness of public places. The new Justice controlled fraud and the Censors controlled corruption among public offices. For political and more internal matters, the Republic sometimes also resorted to the use of hit men and had a network of spies comparable to modern secret services.

===Symbols===
Since the retrieval of Mark the Evangelist&#x27;s body from Alexandria in 828 and its arrival in Venice, the lagoon state established a special relationship with its patron. This bond, caused by the particular importance of the relic and above all by the bond existing between the Saint and the Churches of north-eastern Italy which traced their origins to his preaching, led to the patron saint being considered as the guardian of the State&#x27;s sovereignty, becoming its symbol. The republic thus came to be called the Republic of Saint Mark and its lands were frequently known as &quot;Terre di San Marco&quot;.

The winged lion, symbol of Mark the Evangelist, appeared on the Republic&#x27;s flags, coats of arms and seals, while the Doges themselves were depicted kneeling at the coronation, in the act of receiving the gonfalon from the Saint.

&quot;Long live Saint Mark!&quot; was the Republic of Venice&#x27;s battle cry, used until its dissolution in 1797 following Napoleon&#x27;s Italian campaign, and in the reborn republic governed by Daniele Manin and Niccolò Tommaseo. The cry &quot;San Marco!&quot; is used by the military personnel of the Lagunari Regiment &quot;Serenissima&quot; in every official activity or ceremony, since today&#x27;s lagoon soldiers of the Italian army have inherited the traditions of the &quot;Fanti da Mar&quot; of the Serenissima.

The only equestrian order of the Republic was the Order of Saint Mark or the Doge.

==Society==
Starting from the 13th century, Venetian society clearly distinguished two social classes:

; Patricians
: The Venetian aristocracy was a relatively open social category documented in the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot;: the first were the direct descendants of the first tribunes and their magistrates, to which were added the families who actively and above all economically participated in the War of Chioggia, the War of Candia and the Morean War. In 1774, all noble houses of the Mainland Dominions were also added to the &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot;. The &quot;Libro d&#x27;Oro&quot; was managed by the Avogadoria de Comùn and contained the list of all the births and weddings of the patriciate. The aristocracy was not only a class of privileged people, but also of professional servants of the State. They were all educated, the richest attending the University of Padua while the impoverished nobility were educated for free at the Giudecca. To prevent the concentration of power in a few hands, ensure a certain turnover and allow the greatest number of aristocrats to have employment, all these positions were short-lived, often lasting only one year and were often poorly paid. Nobles were not allowed to have relations with foreigners, leave the borders of the Republic, ask for pardons or distribute money; the nobility maintained itself even after judicial accusations and betrayal of the homeland.
; Citizens
: Venetian citizenship was of three types:
:* &quot;Original citizens&quot;: Natives of Venice or from Venetian families up to the third degree enjoyed full citizenship, excluding Jews. The original citizens were also allowed to assume public offices, being able to become chancellors, secretaries, lawyers and notaries. Furthermore, citizens joined together in &quot;scholae&quot;, religious or professional confraternities that provided mutual aid to all members and allowed rules to be set for the various professions that took place in Venice.
:* &quot;Citizens de intra&quot;: New arrivals, based on merit, were granted full citizenship and the guarantee of the State within the borders and were allowed to carry out some jobs within the city.
:* &quot;Citizens de extra&quot;: This was also a full citizenship granted on merit which conferred the privilege to sail and trade as a Venetian citizen.

===Jews===

The earliest evidence of Jewish presence in Venice dates back to 932; in the 12th century the community had around a thousand members and was established in Mestre rather than Giudecca as was previously believed. Every day the Jews left Mestre and went to Venice, in particular to the San Marco and Rialto districts where they were allowed to work; here they trafficked goods and granted money loans, while some carried out the medical profession. Usury work was necessary for the functioning of the city&#x27;s business activities and therefore, although they did not have citizenship and were not allowed to live there or buy a house, Jews were admitted to the capital with permits that were renewed every five or ten years. With a decree dated 22 May 1298, a limit was placed on the interest rate on loans, which was set between 10% and 12% and at the same time a tax of 5% was imposed on commercial traffic.

In 1385, a group of Jewish moneylenders were allowed to live in the lagoon for the first time. On 25 September 1386 they requested and obtained the purchase of part of the land of the Monastery of San Nicolò al Lido to bury their deceased, creating the Jewish cemetery of Venice, which is still functioning today. Towards the end of the 14th century, restrictions on Jews increased and they were only allowed to stay in the city for two weeks; furthermore they were forced to wear a yellow circle as a distinctive sign, which in the 16th century transformed into a red cloth.

After the defeat of Agnadello by the League of Cambrai, many Jews from Vicenza and Conegliano took refuge in the lagoon, making coexistence with the Christians difficult. Following social tensions, the Venetian Ghetto was established on 29 March 1516 where the foundries had previously stood and in 1541 it was expanded to make room for the Levantine Jews. The work of the Jews was placed under the supervision of the magistrates in Cattaver, and in addition to managing the ghetto&#x27;s pawnshops they were allowed to trade in second-hand goods, making the ghetto an important commercial center. The ghetto was divided into communities based on their country of origin, each with its own synagogue.

After the plague the ghetto was repopulated by some Eastern European Jews and in 1633 the ghetto was expanded, but in the meantime Venice had lost its centrality and the Jewish community also began to shrink; taxes towards it increased and sectarian movements began to arise. The situation declined until in 1737 the community declared bankruptcy.

===Publishing===
Printing and other graphic arts constituted a thriving economic sector of the Republic and the main means of disseminating Venetian knowledge and discoveries in the technical, humanistic and scientific fields. The birth of Venetian publishing dates back to the 15th century, in particular to 18 September 1469 when, through the efforts of the German Johann of Speyer, the Venetian government passed the first law to protect publishers by granting a printing privilege which gave the publisher the exclusive right to print certain works. In addition to the German community, the French community, led by Nicolas Jenson, also owned most of the Venetian printing presses towards the end of the 15th century.

Between 1495 and 1515 Aldus Manutius further developed Venetian publishing via three innovations which later spread throughout Europe: the octavo format, the italic character and the hooked comma. These inventions allowed him to become the largest Venetian publisher and consequently attracted the major humanists of the time, including Pietro Bembo and Erasmus. After Manutius, many other Italian entrepreneurs such as the Florentine Lucantonio Giunti opened printing presses in Venice, which towards the end of the 16th century reached 200 businesses, each with higher book circulations than the average for European cities. The large quantity of printing houses scattered throughout the Venetian territory made the city of Venice a leader in the sector, so much so that in the last twenty years of the 15th century one book in ten in Europe was printed in Venice. Book production in Venice was encouraged not only by the rules in favor of publishers, but also by the lack of censorship; in the 16th century works prohibited in the rest of Europe such as the &quot;Lustful Sonnets&quot; were printed in Venice.

==Religion==
===Catholicism===

The Republic of Venice recognized Catholicism as the state religion and while remaining relatively tolerant compared to other confessions, there were many laws in favor of Catholic traditions given that according the 1770 census, approximately 86.5% of the population was Catholic. The Catholic Church administered the territory of the Republic first with the Patriarchate of Grado which had the Diocese of Castello as its suffragen, which was then suppressed on 8 October 1451 by Pope Nicholas V to erect the Patriarchate of Venice which then also incorporated the dioceses of Jesolo, Torcello and Caorle. During the history of the Republic of Venice, the cathedral of the patriarchate was the Basilica of San Pietro di Castello which was changed to St Mark only in 1807, ten years after the fall of the Republic. During the period of the Counter-Reformation, the Inquisition was also active in the Republic of Venice, which from 1542 to 1794 tried 3,620 defendants including Giordano Bruno, Pier Paolo Vergerio and Marco Antonio de Dominis. Crimes relating to faith, such as witchcraft, were regulated by a secular court as early as 1181 during the regency of Doge Orio Mastropiero. The tribunal, in addition to being made up of its judges appointed by the doge, also availed itself of the help of the bishops and the patriarch of Grado and the most widespread punishment for those convicted was that of being burned at the stake. These magistrates continued to intervene as lay members even in the trials of the Inquisition, often coming into conflict with the Church and sometimes mitigating the harshness of the punishment. Furthermore, the Inquisition only had power over Christians and not over members of other confessions such as Jews. The government also regulated the construction of places of worship, limited bequests to the Church, favored by the presence of parish priests-notaries, and controlled priests who preached against the government, sometimes expelling them from the state.

===Other religions===

In addition to the Catholic faith in the Republic of Venice, particularly in the Stato da Mar, the Orthodox church was also present; according to the 1770 census, the Orthodox Greeks constituted approximately 13.3% of the population. The Greek Orthodox community was also present in the capital and in 1456 the Greeks obtained permission to build the church of San Biagio in Venice, the only church in the city where they could celebrate their rites. In 1514, due to overcrowding of San Biagio, the construction of the church of San Giorgio dei Greci was permitted.

The remaining population belonged to other churches such as the Protestant and the Armenian Catholic churches and there were also Islamic merchants, who however did not reside permanently in Venice. The Armenians settled in Venice as early as the mid-13th century, although the construction of the first Armenian Catholic church, the church of Santa Croce degli Armeni, dates back only to 1682. San Lazzaro degli Armeni also served as the Armenians&#x27; main cultural center.

The Protestant religion, which could be practiced freely, also spread in the Republic of Venice through commercial relations maintained with the Germans and the Swiss. In 1649 the Protestants obtained the possibility of burying their dead in the Church of San Bartolomeo and in 1657 they were allowed to celebrate masses with German shepherds in the Fondaco dei Tedeschi.

In Venice there was also the Fondaco dei Turchi where the Ottoman merchants spent their time and in which there was a small mosque, the only place of prayer for the Muslim faithful who stayed in Venice.

In 1770 there were only 5,026 Jews, equal to approximately 0.2% of the Republic of Venice&#x27;s population, but various laws were promulgated for this minority which limited their relationship with Catholics and their civil liberties. Following the expulsion of the Jews in almost all of Europe, the Jews of Venice were allowed to remain in the ghetto so as not to create disorder in the city and to be able to carry out their traditions and pray in the synagogues. In Venice there were five synagogues belonging to the different Venetian Jewish communities, also called universities or nations, which held the liturgy here following different rites for each synagogue.

==Economy==

===Resources===
Since the first settlements, fishing played a fundamental role in the livelihood of the lagoon communities. Fishing was one of the most widespread activities among the common people who also dedicated themselves to fish farming. After being caught, the fish was salted to improve preservation. In addition to fishing, although to a lesser extent, hunting, fowling and pastoralism were widespread but were limited by the scarcity of pastures in the &quot;Dogado&quot;. Since pastures in the lagoon were limited, agriculture was instead widespread mainly with vegetable crops and some vineyards, the agricultural products of which were sold by fruit merchants.

In addition to fishing, lagoon populations heavily relied on salt extraction for their livelihood. Owing to the salt trade, the first lagoon populations were able to purchase goods that the Venetian Lagoon did not produce, primarily wheat. A direct competitor in the production of salt was Comacchio, which was destroyed in 932 and its population transferred to the Venetian Lagoon. The areas of greatest production were the northern part of the lagoon and the district of Chioggia which over the centuries became the greatest salt producer in the Mediterranean, reaching its peak in the 13th century. Most of the salt produced in Chioggia was exported to Italy via the Po and the Adige. The salt pans were made up of a series of dams, basins and canals that allowed them to function correctly. Their extension was notable; the Chioggia salt pans occupied an area of approximately 30 km² which corresponded to ninety times the size of the city. The impetus for the foundations&#x27; construction was given by the Doge and the great ducal families who held the property. The estates of the nobles were rented to the families of the salt workers who independently maintained the salt pan and extracted the salt. The owners of the land had an exclusively economic relationship with the salt workers; consequently the nobles, owners of the land, could not consider themselves feudal lords as was the case in the rest of Europe in the cultivation of wheat. The salt workers also organized consortia which made noble imposition of the landowners even more difficult. In the 14th century, during the height of commercial expansion, salt production in the lagoon had decreased. Regardless, Venice maintained a monopoly on this precious commodity by requiring merchants to transport a certain percentage of salt which was often purchased in Puglia, Sicily, Sardinia, the Balearic Islands, Cyprus and on the coast of Libya.

===Industry===
Venetian glass, traded as early as the 9th century in the form of sheets, is still considered one of the leading products of the Venetian industry. Because of its quality, Venetian glass was used to make works of art exported all over the world. Its production was located solely on the island of Murano to avoid the spread of fires within the capital. Despite the glass production, the most successful activity was that of shipbuilding which took place within the state arsenal, active since the 12th century, but also in the small Venetian shipyards of the city. Alongside the construction of ships, the production of naval cordage was developed by the &quot;filacànevi&quot;, who starting from the 13th century imported hemp from Russia via the Black Sea. Among the activities already widespread in the 13th century were tanneries and wool spinning, which were exercised in Giudecca.

===Trade===

From its early history, trade was the basis of the Republic of Venice&#x27;s success and political rise: in 829, the Doge Giustiniano Participazio was involved not only in the management of his feudal assets but also in commercial affairs by sea. The commercial enterprises of Venetian citizens increased in the 12th century, a period which saw the creation of the mude, caravans of merchant galleys which, escorted by armed ships, headed towards the eastern markets, starting with that of Constantinople. Venice had a privileged relationship with the Byzantine Empire starting from 1082 when, with the issuing of the Golden Bull, Venetian merchants were allowed to exchange goods with the Byzantines without any tax and to establish an inhabited nucleus directly in the capital, a privilege which however ended violently in 1171 by the decree of Manuel I Komnenos. Commercial traffic reached its peak in the 13th century, but continued to be fundamental in the political and social life of Venice until the end of the 16th century. This period saw the establishment of state-sanctioned mude, convoys of ships contracted to merchants which were used to reach faraway lands including India, China, England and Flanders. The Republic&#x27;s trade was so extensive that in 1325 the existence of Venetian settlements was noted in northern European cities including Southampton and Bruges and in Asian cities such as Zaiton, Sudak, Azov, Trabzon, and Amman as well as other settlements on the shores of the Aral Sea. Venetian trade suffered a sharp decline at the end of the 16th century when competition from the Portuguese, Spanish, English and Dutch became suffocating for Venetian merchants.

The goods that the Venetians exchanged mostly by sea and which crowded the central Rialto market were: cotton, fabrics, iron, wood, alum, salt and spices exchanged as early as the 9th century; the testament of Bishop Orso Participazio, in which pepper is mentioned, dates back to 853. In addition to pepper, Venice traded large quantities of cinnamon, cumin, coriander, cloves and many other spices which played a fundamental role in the preservation of meat, for the flavoring of wines and for medical treatments of which Venetian medicine made a large use. Spices also include sugar, produced in Cyprus and refined in Venice and all the perfumes and incenses widely used by Venetian patricians and during religious functions. In addition to spices, the East also supplied precious stones and silk, vice versa Venice brought European metals, wood, leather and fabrics to the East. Another good of which Venice held a monopoly was salt, which was shared wherever there was some, and given its usefulness the Republic obliged every merchant to transport a certain quantity. The salt monopoly, as well as being a commercial privilege, was also a political deterrent against foreign nations. Another commodity of fundamental importance was the cereals which were managed by the Wheat Chamber to combat possible famines. There was also a large import of oil used not only in seasoning but also for lighting.

===Coinage===

The great expansion of Venetian trade began in the 12th century and the need for a stable currency became increasingly urgent. In 1202, during the dogate of Enrico Dandolo, the minting of the silver ducat (later called &quot;matapan&quot;) began, which quickly spread throughout the Mediterranean basin. The ducat corresponded to 26 denarii and weighed approximately two grams. Like the other coins of the Republic of Venice, the ducat had the effigy of the reigning doge, who held the standard of Venice in front of Saint Mark.

On 31 October 1284, Doge Giovanni Dandolo decided to mint a new currency, which would later be vital in the Venetian economy: the gold sequin, or ducat. The sequin, made of excellent purity gold, weighed approximately 3.5 grams and its minting was interrupted only with the fall of the Republic. Starting from the 16th century, minting took place in a special building overlooking the Marciano Pier, the Zecca of Venice, over whose activity the Council of Forty supervised.

==Culture==
===Art===
The Venetian Renaissance was one of the fundamental declinations of the Italian Renaissance. Renaissance art arrived in Veneto through Donatello&#x27;s stay in Padua from 1443 to 1453, later spreading to painting through Squarcione and his students. Shortly afterwards the new style also spread to Venice (traditionally linked to late Gothic culture) following Giovanni Bellini, after which Venetian art was revolutionized by Giorgione and – at the beginning of the sixteenth century – by Titian. This era ends with Veronese and Tintoretto, the latter dying in 1594, who marked the transition towards mannerism.

===Theatre===

Until the 17th century, theatrical works were performed in noble palaces or in public by the Compagnie della Calza who staged their works on mobile wooden theatres. During the 17th century there was a great diffusion of the theater so much so that in 1637 Venice&#x27;s first permanent theater, the Teatro San Cassiano, was inaugurated with a presentation of &quot;Andromeda&quot; by Benedetto Ferrari. Over the course of the century, thanks to the financing of the nobles, a dozen theaters were built in which tragedies and melodramas were mainly performed. In Venice the reform of melodrama was initiated by Apostolo Zeno, who, inspired by French tragedy, made melodrama more sober and constructed his works so that they could be performed even without music.

In the 17th century, although less widespread than melodramas, it represented commedia dell&#x27;arte. Based on the actors&#x27; improvisation and on canovaccio, it was characterized by a large number of stereotyped characters who generically represented the life of the various Venetian social classes. In the 17th century, commedia dell&#x27;arte was completely reformed by Carlo Goldoni who introduced a new form of theater thanks to the elimination of masks and the introduction of a precise script. Conversely, Carlo Gozzi staged presentations of fairy tales, exalting and exasperating the tradition of commedia dell&#x27;arte.

===Fashion===

Due to its commercial relationship with the East, the sumptuous clothing typical of the Byzantines soon spread in Venice, consisting mostly of embroidered or quilted blue tunics, the symbolic color of the Venetians. Among the common people, however, long canvas dresses decorated with colored stripes were widespread and the shoes were usually leather sandals. Over the cassock, men often wore large cloaks as well as belts and hats. The clothes of noblewomen were made of embroidered silk, very long and low-cut. They usually also wore trailing cloaks and furs from a large variety of animals, among which the ermine stood out. With the establishment of the guild in the 13th century, the art of tailors was also regulated and protected with the institution of dress tailors, ziponi tailors and sock tailors who dedicated themselves respectively to making clothes, fustian jackets and socks.

With the beginning of the Renaissance following European fashion, the dresses of noblewomen became increasingly sumptuous, while men began to wear skirts combined with long two-tone stockings. Since the streets were not paved, they risked dirtying clothes, so very high clogs became widespread which were then removed once the home was reached. Between the 15th and 16th centuries the Baroque influence led to the excesses of noble clothing which in this era also began to be embellished with locally produced Burano lace. To prevent the nobles and patricians from spending enormous amounts of money on clothing, in 1488 the Republic issued laws aimed at limiting the use of excessively expensive clothes, so much so that in 1514 pump supervisors were established who had the task of monitoring the amount of money spent on private parties, clothes and other luxury goods.

In the 17th century the fashion for the wig and the use of face powder began and men&#x27;s clothes progressively became bulkier. In the 18th century, the &quot;velada&quot;, a sort of large, richly decorated cloak, was introduced into men&#x27;s clothing. Contrariwise, the &quot;vesta a cendà&quot; came into use among women&#x27;s clothing, a modest dress which consisted of a long dress, usually black, and a white scarf. The poorer women, on the other hand, wore a round white dress that covered the head with a hood and was tied with a belt.

==Traditions==

The Republic of Venice had numerous historical and folkloristic traditions of various kinds, some of which are still celebrated following its fall. In Venice, religious holidays were celebrated with extremely sumptuous processions directed towards St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in which the Doge took part, preceded by the various government assemblies and the city&#x27;s major schools. In addition to all the major Catholic holidays, the Feast of Saint Mark, which commemorates the city&#x27;s patron saint, was also celebrated with equal pomp. During the year, various masses were also held in memory of some fundamental events in the Republic&#x27;s history, such as the failure of the Tiepolo conspiracy or that hatched by the Doge Marino Faliero and others such as the Festa delle Marie to celebrate the power of Venice. One of the festivals of greatest political importance was the Festa della Sensa, celebrated on Ascension Day, which included a parade of boats led by the Bucentaur and the rite of the Marriage of the Sea which symbolized the maritime dominion of Venice.

Among the profane festivals, one of the most important was the Carnival: celebrated for its entire duration, it included the major celebrations on Mardi Gras and Shrove Tuesday. In addition to dances and shows of various types, on the last Sunday of Carnival the bull hunt took place, an event similar to Spanish-style bullfighting. In addition to the Carnival, the Regatta was held, which like the other festivals included large celebrations and processions.

<doc id="613505" wikidata="Q5283217" url="?curid=613505" title="Distributive writing">
<text>Distributive writing is the collective authorship (or distributed authorship) of texts.

This further requires both a definition of &quot;collective&quot; and &quot;texts&quot;, where collective means a connected group of individuals and texts are inscribed symbols chained together to achieve a larger meaning than isolated symbols. This places emphasis on texts being represented as writings. This could be written words, iconic symbology (e.g., graffiti), computer programming languages (C/C++, Java, Perl, etc.), meta-level mark-up (HTML, XML, SVG, PostScript), and their derivative works. Also, not to be excluded are all the above in various languages. Further, to define texts, we must also have an interpreter for the texts. For computer programming languages, we have a compiler, for writings we have written words interpreted by our mental faculties, and for meta-level mark-up there are web browsers, printers to interpret postscript, and various software applications which turn textual representations into another format. (Patrick Deegan and Jon Phillips, 2004)

== In ancient and oral literatures ==
The concept of distributed authorship has been applied to oral traditions in which one person&#x27;s telling of a traditional story reflects the oral recitations of many previous tellers. It has likewise been applied to oral-derived written traditions, where a manuscript text is shaped by its transmission through multiple scribes, each of whom may alter the text.

== Software to support distributive writing ==

=== Social Software ===
Social Software enables people to connect, communicate, and collaborate. It is explicitly the social which is of importance and is what is operated on. It is the commodity in the system. This is different from Distributive Writing because social software is based upon software, whereas DW is not, and is not just about collaborative writing. It is also about other forms of socializing.

=== Collaborative software, aka Groupware ===
GroupWare is about software and more importantly, in common use to describe combining many pieces of software together into a group for so-called easy access for an individual. The original definition had to do with a group of people operating on something collaboratively through software, but this has changed meaning due to corporate appropriation to describe software suites like Microsoft Office and LibreOffice.

=== Computer-supported collaboration (CSCT) ===
Distributive writing is not just bound to computing like CSCT.

== Types ==
Synchronous – System of authorship where both author&#x27;s make changes in real time (at the same time).

 – System of authorship where both author&#x27;s make changes in non-real time (render time or not at the time).

<doc id="613506" wikidata="Q5228662" url="?curid=613506" title="Dave Desroches">
<text>Dave &quot;Rave&quot; DesRoches is a Canadian rock musician from Hamilton, Ontario.

To the general public, he is the sometime Teenage Head rhythm guitarist on the early recordings who graduated to lead singer during a Frankie Venom hiatus in 1985 and catapulted the band back into the charts. Many know him as a session player who has played with such notables as Daniel Lanois, Andrew Loog Oldham and Alex Chilton.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Dave began his music career in his high school years writing songs and performing driving acoustic rock and folk-pop in and around Hamilton. This evolved into the group, The Shakers, from 1979 to 1982 with Rick Andrew, Tim Gibbons and Claude DesRoches. They charted many singles with albums produced by Daniel Lanois (U2) and Jack Richardson (Guess Who, Alice Cooper).

=== Teenage Head ===
Three years after the break-up of The Shakers in 1982, Dave took over as lead singer of the punk rock band Teenage Head. He had grown up with the members of the band and had played as a backing musician on their &quot;Frantic City&quot; LP, and &quot;The Shakers&quot; had often opened for their fellow Hamiltonians. Dave replaced Frankie Venom who had worked with Dave on several other projects. He continued to aid Teenage Head with hits like &quot;Can’t Stop Shakin&#x27;&quot;. Dave left Teenage Head after a successful run to try things out on his own. In November 2016, Teenage Head announced the return of Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Desroches as lead singer.

=== The Dave Rave Conspiracy ===
Alongside producer Gary Pig Gold he formed a group called &quot;The Dave Rave Conspiracy&quot;, releasing the album &quot;Valentino&#x27;s Pirates&quot; on Russia&#x27;s Melodiya record label in 1992. However, to appease cold war era Russian sensibilities, the album was credited to the Dave Rave &quot;Group&quot;, as the label was uncomfortable with the word &quot;conspiracy&quot;. Notably, the band also included Billy Ficca, formerly of the influential New York City band Television, and Lauren Agnelli, of the 1980s anti-folk band Washington Squares. &quot;Valentino&#x27;s Pirates&quot; has become a quite a cult classic, and was the first North American rock album released by a post-Soviet state after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Press surrounding this release included a CBC documentary revisiting Russia with the group as well as three promotional videos that were in heavy rotation at MuchMusic in Canada. Bullseye Records re-issued the album for the first time on CD in 2001.

The next Dave Rave Conspiracy album, Three Octave Fantastic Hexagram, was released in 1994 and included many of the players from the Valentino&#x27;s album along with former Washington Squares, Lauren Agnelli. However, the band broke up shortly afterward. Agnelli and Dave Rave formed an incredible creative partnership that resulted in three Agnelli &amp; Rave albums over the next ten years including the critically acclaimed Cowboy Flowers Sessions, Heaven and Earth, and Confetti.

The Dave Rave Group&#x27;s second album, Everyday Magic, was released in 2003 and featured players from his former bands such as Teenage Head, The Shakers and bands and musicians with whom he had worked as either a musician as a producer such as The Trews, Joe Mannix and Kate Schrock. &quot;Love Fades&quot; and the title track &quot;Everyday Magic&quot; featuring ECMA winners and Juno nominees, The Trews, received airplay at Rock, AC and Campus radio. Dave also co-wrote The Trews&#x27; single, &quot;I Can’t Say&quot; with Jack Richardson. Other co-writing credits include bands such as Oliver Black, now Townline, and the Maddhatters and he continues to work with and mentor some of the hottest acts today.

Dave spends his time in Canada and the US playing live, producing, writing and coming up with more ideas to bring great musicians together. Dave Rave released his Anthology in two volumes worldwide on Bullseye Records in January 2006. He has also released his second jazz-pop album, &quot;In The Blue of My Dreams&quot;, with Mark McCarron in 2007 under the Bongobeat label. It was shortlisted for a Grammy that year. He spent 2008 writing, producing and touring the globe.

Dave Rave spent 2009 playing over 100 shows, including Grey Cup 2009 and three European tours and he had a chance to work again with the Trews on the song &quot;How’s Everything&quot; on their Top 10 DVD. He also had time to record the album, &quot;Live with What You Know&quot;, which was released in June 2010 on the Bongo Beat label. Players on the album include members of The Trews, Plastic Heroes, Rick Andrew (The Shakers), Sonic Blue Sound Review, Mark McCarron, The Maddhatters, Gary Pig Gold and the debut of vocalist Kate MacDonald on &quot;Silver Lines&quot; among many other great musicians. Dave has already toured Europe twice in 2010 with one more European tour to go along with a tour of North America in support of the new record.

<text> ( ; ; pl. ; ; 1512, from Middle French , literally &quot;my lord&quot;) is an honorific title that was used to refer to or address the eldest living brother of the king in the French royal court. It has now become the customary French title of respect and term of address for a French-speaking man, corresponding to such English titles as Mr. or sir.

== History ==
Under the Ancien Régime, the court title of Monsieur referred to the next brother in the line of succession of the King of France. It was always used for referring to the prince, not as a style. The Kings&#x27; brothers were addressed as Monseigneur or Royal Highness.

Hercule François, Duke of Anjou and Alençon (1555–1584), was the first notable member of the royalty to assume the title without the use of an adjoining proper name. In 1576, Monsieur pressured his brother King Henry III of France into signing the Edict of Beaulieu and effectively ending the Fifth Religious War of France. The resulting peace became popularly known as &quot;the Peace of Monsieur&quot;.

The title was later assumed by Gaston, Duke of Orléans, brother of Louis XIII, and then Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, brother of Louis XIV. From 1643 to 1660, while both princes were alive, Philippe was commonly known as &quot;le Petit Monsieur&quot;, while Gaston, his uncle, was known as &quot;le Grand Monsieur&quot;.

For over seventy years, from 1701 to 1774, the title had no living representatives in the French court, as Philippe I of Orléans died in 1701; Louis XV was the youngest of the sons of Louis of France, Duke of Burgundy and at the time of his accession to the throne in 1715 had no brothers.

The title was restored in 1775 for Louis Stanislas Xavier, Count of Provence, the oldest surviving brother of the reigning Louis XVI, who assumed the title of Louis XVIII in pretence in 1795. After his coronation in 1814, the title passed to Charles Philippe, Count of Artois, his younger brother. Charles Philippe, who led the ultras during the Bourbon Restoration and became King Charles X in 1824, was the last royal sibling to officially hold the title of Monsieur. His successor, Louis-Philippe I, the next and last king to rule France, had lost both his brothers, Louis Charles and Antoine Philippe, many years before he succeeded to the throne.

A fuller list of those who have been known by this title includes:

*Charles, Duke of Orléans (1559–1560)
*Henri, Duke of Anjou (1560–1574)
*François, Duke of Anjou (1555–1584)
*Gaston, Duke of Orléans (1611–1643)
*Philippe, Duke of Orléans (1643–1701)
*Louis Stanislas, Count of Provence (1774–1793)
*Charles Philippe, Count of Artois (1795–1823)

== Modern usage ==
In modern French, &quot;monsieur&quot; (plural &quot;messieurs&quot;) is used as a courtesy title of respect, an equivalent of English &quot;mister&quot; or &quot;sir&quot;. It can be abbreviated in &quot;M.&quot; (plural &quot;MM.&quot;), &quot;Mssr.&quot; (plural &quot;Mssrs.&quot;), and rarely &quot;Mr&quot; (plural &quot;Mrs&quot;), but never &quot;Mr.&quot;, which is only for &quot;Mister&quot;.

<doc id="613518" wikidata="Q1364349" url="?curid=613518" title="Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!">
<text>Win a Date with Tad Hamilton! is a 2004 American romantic comedy film directed by Robert Luketic, written by Victor Levin and starring Kate Bosworth, Topher Grace, Josh Duhamel, Gary Cole, Ginnifer Goodwin, Sean Hayes and Nathan Lane. The film follows a small-town girl (Bosworth) who wins a contest for a date with a male celebrity (Duhamel) and a love triangle forms between the girl, the star and the girl&#x27;s best friend (Grace).

The character&#x27;s name of Tad Hamilton has been seen as a cross between the names of screen idols Tab Hunter and George Hamilton.

The film received mixed reviews from critics and earned $17.1 million in the United States and $4.2 million overseas for a worldwide total of $21.3 million, making it a commercial failure against a $22 million budget.

==Plot==
A soldier and nurse emerge from two 1940s-style cars in the middle of the night. As the nurse runs up to the soldier, the camera switches, revealing that this is a film scene.

Rosalee, Cathy, and Pete, Piggly Wiggly store workers in Fraziers Bottom, West Virginia, are watching the film, and as the nurse asks for forgiveness and the soldier agrees, the women in the audience are moved to tears as Pete is clearly unimpressed.

As the ladies wonder what the film&#x27;s star Tad Hamilton is doing at that moment, Tad is described by his agent as &quot;drinking, driving, smoking, leering, and groping all at the same time.&quot;

The agent tells Tad that his hedonism is damaging his reputation and career opportunities. To improve his image and convince a film director to cast him, his agents establish a competition to win a date with Tad, with proceeds benefiting the charity Save the Children. Rosalee finds an online advertisement for the competition.

With the help of the Piggly Wiggly customers and a reluctant Pete, Cathy and Rosalee raise the $100 entrance fee as Pete tells his superior that he will leave for college in Richmond after he talks &quot;with someone about going to Richmond with me.&quot;

A news crew arrives outside Rosalee&#x27;s home because she has won the date with Tad. A despondent Pete accompanies her to the airport. Awed by Los Angeles, Rosalee becomes tongue-tied in Tad&#x27;s presence. The date does not go well; Rosalee vomits in the limousine, and when Tad mentions his love of animals, which Pete had warned was a signal of sexual intentions, her suspicions are raised. After seeing Tad&#x27;s house, Rosalee requests to return to the hotel and soon returns home, leaving Tad thoughtful.

Pete is about to tell Rosalee about moving to Richmond when she is surprised by Tad&#x27;s sudden arrival. Although she is still cynical, when he admits to not having &quot;his priorities straight,&quot; she is convinced of his good intentions.

On a phone call with his agent, Tad insists that he wants to turn over a new leaf and won&#x27;t return to Los Angeles for a while. When he gathers Rosalee for a date, he leaves a positive impression on Rosalee&#x27;s father, who had studied hard for the encounter. Pete tries to stop their date by reporting them for illegally parking. He tries to convince Rosalee that Tad is using her. Despite all of Pete&#x27;s efforts, Rosalee and Tad grow close over the next few days.

In a bar, Pete corners Tad in the men&#x27;s room. After conceding that Rosalee is in love with Tad, Pete tells him that she is more than a &quot;wholesome small town girl&quot; but a wonderful person with &quot;the kind of beauty a guy only sees once.&quot; He explains her six smiles that reveal her emotions.

Pete makes Tad swear not to break Rosalee&#x27;s heart. When Rosalee is in Tad&#x27;s hotel room, his agents appear and inform him that the director has cast him in the film. Tad is overjoyed and convinces Rosalee to accompany him to Los Angeles by employing Pete&#x27;s &quot;six smiles&quot; speech.

After a rousing speech about great love by Angelica, a barmaid with a crush on him, Pete rushes to Rosalee&#x27;s, confessing his love. She is confused and resolves to still travel to California with Tad. On the plane, Tad fails to identify one of Rosalee&#x27;s smiles and then confesses his lie, prompting her to return home.

Rosalee runs to Piggly Wiggly and to Pete&#x27;s, where Angelica tells her how Pete feels and that he is going to Richmond to escape his heartbreak. Rosalee then drives furiously toward Richmond to find Pete. In a manner similar to that of the opening scene, Rosalee and Pete exit their cars and Pete asks her to dance.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film opened in 2,711 venues on January 23, 2004 and earned $7,320,066 in its opening weekend, ranking third in the North American box office and second among the week&#x27;s new releases. The film ultimately grossed $17,071,962 in North America and $4,206,494 internationally for a worldwide total of $21,278,456. Based on a $22 million budget, the film was a box-office bomb.

===Critical response===
&quot;Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 55% approval rating based on 149 reviews, with an average of 5.60/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Formulaic romantic comedy works better than it should thanks to a charming cast.&quot; Metacritic reports a score of 52 out of 100 based on 35 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert criticized the film, noting that Duhamel&#x27;s character always seems more likeable than Grace&#x27;s, and that the film spends more time building a romance between Rosalee and Tad rather than between Rosalee and Pete. Bosworth&#x27;s acting was praised for holding the film together.

Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; regarded the film as tonally inconsistent in its attempt to be both an old-fashioned romantic comedy and modern (albeit gentle) satire.

Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden regarded the film&#x27;s plot as resembling those of the 1950s, &quot;dressed up just enough to seem contemporary.&quot; Holden regarded Bosworth&#x27;s role as the toughest, as she showed Rosalee&#x27;s &quot;feet-on-the-ground optimism and innate wisdom&quot; easily.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS and DVD by DreamWorks Home Entertainment on April 20, 2004. The DVD features 16 deleted scenes. It was released on Blu-ray disc by Paramount Home Entertainment on April 26, 2022.
