<text>In geology, a lode is a deposit of ore that fills or is embedded in a fracture (or crack) in a rock formation or a vein of ore that is deposited or embedded between layers of rock. The current meaning (ore vein) dates from the 17th century, being an expansion of an earlier sense of a &quot;channel, watercourse&quot; in Late Middle English, which in turn is from the 11th-century meaning of &quot;lode&quot; as a &quot;course, way&quot;.

The generally accepted hydrothermal model of lode deposition posits that metals dissolved in hydrothermal solutions (hot spring fluids) deposit the gold or other metallic minerals inside the fissures in the pre-existing rocks. Lode deposits are distinguished primarily from placer deposits, where the ore has been eroded out from its original depositional environment and redeposited by sedimentation. A third process for ore deposition is as an evaporite.

A stringer lode is one in which the rock is so permeated by small veinlets that rather than mining the veins, the entire mass of ore and the enveined country rock is mined. It is so named because of the irregular branching of the veins into many anastomosis stringers, so that the ore is not separable from the country rock.

One of the largest silver lodes was the Comstock Lode in Nevada, although it is overshadowed by the more recently discovered Cannington Lode in Queensland, Australia. The largest gold lode in the United States was the Homestake Lode. The Broken Hill Lode in South Australia is the largest lead-zinc lode ever discovered.

<doc id="626029" wikidata="Q1198780" url="?curid=626029" title="The Great Caruso">
<text>The Great Caruso is a 1951 biographical film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and starring Mario Lanza as famous operatic tenor Enrico Caruso. The movie was directed by Richard Thorpe and produced by Joe Pasternak with Jesse L. Lasky as associate producer. The screenplay, by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig, was suggested by the biography &quot;Enrico Caruso His Life and Death&quot; by Dorothy Caruso, the tenor&#x27;s widow. The original music was composed and arranged by Johnny Green and the cinematography by Joseph Ruttenberg. Costume design was by Helen Rose and Gile Steele.

The film is a highly fictionalized biography of the life of Caruso.

==Cast==
The Opera Montage are Metropolitan Opera stars, notably sopranos Teresa Celli, Lucine Amara and Marina Koshetz, mezzo-soprano Blanche Thebom, baritone Giuseppe Valdengo and bass Nicola Moscona.

==Historicity==
Although &quot;The Great Caruso&quot; follows the basic facts of Caruso&#x27;s life, several of the characters and incidents portrayed in the movie are fictional. Because of this, members of the Caruso family in Italy successfully sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for monetary damages, and the studio was temporarily ordered to withdraw the film from exhibition in Italy. Here are a few of the films&#x27; many factual discrepancies:
* Early in the film, a montage shows the young Caruso rising through the ranks from operatic chorister to supporting singer, including singing the secondary tenor role of Spoletta in Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Tosca&quot;. Caruso never sang in an opera chorus, nor did he ever appear in a supporting role. When &quot;Tosca&quot; premiered in January 1900, Caruso was already a rising international opera star and had been considered by Puccini himself for &quot;Tosca&#x27;s&quot; starring tenor role of Cavaradossi, though the part was given to another tenor, Emilio De Marchi. When Caruso first sang the role of Cavaradossi in Bologna later that year, Puccini stated that he had never heard the part better sung.
* In the film, Caruso makes his American debut at the Metropolitan Opera in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Aida&quot; and is met with silence from the audience and scathing critical reviews. In reality, Caruso&#x27;s Met debut in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; was very well-received, and he became an immediate favorite with New York audiences and critics.
*Giulio Gatti-Casazza is depicted in the film as the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera at the time of Caruso&#x27;s debut there in 1903. In reality, Gatti-Casazza did not arrive at the Met until 1908, five years after Caruso&#x27;s debut, replacing the previous general manager Heinrich Conried.
* Although the events in the film follow no clear timeline, in real life Caruso met his future wife Dorothy Park Benjamin in 1917 and married her the following year; in the film, Caruso and Dorothy appear to meet at the time of his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1903 (In reality, Dorothy Benjamin would have been only ten years old in 1903), and marries her after returning to New York after a long &quot;world tour&quot; which appears to last for several years. In actuality, Caruso never made any such lengthy world tour; while he did frequently perform in Europe, South America, Cuba and other countries, the Metropolitan Opera was Caruso&#x27;s artistic home, singing there each opera season regularly from 1903 until 1920.
*Caruso fathered two sons with Italian soprano Ada Giachetti, during a relationship which lasted from 1898 to 1908; Giachetti was married to another man and there was no divorce in Italy at that time. Caruso&#x27;s relationship with Giachetti is not depicted or mentioned in the film, nor is the existence of their children. 
* At the end of the film, Caruso appears to die onstage after a throat hemorrhage during a Metropolitan Opera performance of &quot;Martha&quot;. Caruso did suffer a throat or mouth hemorrhage during a Met performance of &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on December 11, 1920, causing the performance to be cancelled. On December 24, 1920, Caruso sang the final performance of his career in &quot;La Juive&quot; at the Met. He became extremely ill on Christmas Day and on August 2, 1921, he died in his native Naples, possibly of peritonitis, following many months of illness and several surgical procedures.

==Reception==
===Box Office===
&quot;The Great Caruso&quot; was a massive commercial success and the most profitable film for MGM in 1951. It set a record gross at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, grossing $1,390,943 in ten weeks. According to MGM records, it made $4,309,000 in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada and $4,960,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $3,977,000. The movie was also the most popular at the British box office the same year.

===Critics===
&quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote that, &quot;Lanza brings to the role not only a fine, natural and remarkably powerful voice, but a physique and personal mannerisms reminiscent of the immortal Caruso.&quot; According to Bosley Crowther, the film is &quot;perhaps the most elaborate &#x27;pops&#x27; concert ever played upon the screen&quot;; Blyth&#x27;s voice is &quot;reedy&quot; but &quot;Lanza has an excellent young tenor voice and...uses it in his many numbers with impressive dramatic power. Likewise, Miss Kirsten and Miss Thebom are ladies who can rock the welkin, too, and their contributions to the concert maintain it at a musical high.&quot; Crowther says &quot;All of the silliest, sappiest clichés of musical biography have been written by Sonya Levien and William Ludwig into the script. And Richard Thorpe has directed in a comparably mawkish, bathetic style.&quot;

Nearly 40 years after its release, Caruso&#x27;s son, Enrico Caruso Jr. reminisced that, &quot;Vocally and musically &quot;The Great Caruso&quot; is a thrilling motion picture, and it has helped many young people discover opera and even become singers themselves.&quot; He added that, &quot;I can think of no other tenor, before or since Mario Lanza, who could have risen with comparable success to the challenge of playing Caruso in a screen biography.&quot; The film has also been cited by tenors José Carreras, Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti as having been an inspiration for them when they were growing up and aspiring to become singers.

==Awards and honors==
The film was nominated for three Academy Awards; at the 24th Academy Awards ceremony, Douglas Shearer and the MGM Studio Sound Department won for Best Sound.

The film was also Oscar-nominated for its costume design and its score.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals — Nominated

==Soundtrack==
&quot;The Great Caruso&quot; record album (though not an actual film soundtrack) was issued by RCA Victor on the LP, 45 and 78 RPM formats. The album featured eight popular tenor opera arias (four of which were heard in the film) sung by Lanza, accompanied by Constantine Callinicos conducting the RCA Victor Orchestra. The album sold 100,000 copies before the film premiered and later became the first operatic LP to sell one million copies. After its original 1951 release, the album remained continuously available on LP until the late 1980s and was reissued on compact disc by RCA Victor in 1989.

==Trivia==
In 1947, radio actor Elliott Lewis was considered the front-runner for the role of Caruso, and was screen-tested in January and June. That same year the American tenor Richard Tucker, fresh from his success under conductor Tullio Serafin in the reopening of the Verona amphitheater, was considered but was not screen-tested for the role of Caruso.

<doc id="626035" wikidata="Q889515" url="?curid=626035" title="Bed load">
<text>The term bed load or bedload describes particles in a flowing fluid (usually water) that are transported along the stream bed. Bed load is complementary to suspended load and wash load.

Bed load moves by rolling, sliding, and/or saltating (hopping).

Generally, bed load downstream will be smaller and more rounded than bed load upstream (a process known as downstream fining). This is due in part to attrition and abrasion which results from the stones colliding with each other and against the river channel, thus removing the rough texture (rounding) and reducing the size of the particles. However, selective transport of sediments also plays a role in relation to downstream fining: smaller-than average particles are more easily entrained than larger-than average particles, since the shear stress required to entrain a grain is linearly proportional to the diameter of the grain. However, the degree of size selectivity is restricted by the hiding effect described by Parker and Klingeman (1982), wherein larger particles protrude from the bed whereas small particles are shielded and hidden by larger particles, with the result that nearly all grain sizes become entrained at nearly the same shear stress.

Experimental observations suggest that a uniform free-surface flow over a cohesion-less plane bed is unable to entrain sediments below a critical value formula_1 of the ratio between measures of hydrodynamic (destabilizing) and gravitational (stabilizing)
forces acting on sediment particles, the so-called Shields stress formula_2. This quantity reads as:
:formula_3,
where formula_4 is the friction velocity, s is the relative particle density, d is an effective particle diameter which is entrained by the flow, and g is gravity. Meyer-Peter-Müller formula for the bed load capacity under equilibrium and uniform flow conditions states that the magnitude of the bed load flux formula_5 for unit width is proportional to the excess of shear stress with respect to a critical one formula_6. Specifically, formula_5 is a monotonically increasing nonlinear function of the excess Shields stress formula_8, typically expressed in the form of a power law.

<doc id="626045" wikidata="Q743225" url="?curid=626045" title="Michael Fortier">
<text>Michael M. Fortier, (born January 10, 1962) is a Canadian financier, lawyer and former politician. A member of the Conservative Party, he served as Minister of Public Works and Government Services from 2006 to 2008, and Minister of International Trade in 2008 under Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Fortier served in Cabinet of Canada while a Senator, which proved controversial. In 2008, he resigned from the Senate to run for a seat in the House of Commons in the 2008 election; he placed second in riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges.

==Business career==
Before entering the Cabinet, Fortier was a partner at Ogilvy Renault, a leading Montreal law firm. One of his colleagues was Brian Mulroney. He specialized in securities, mergers and acquisitions. From 1992 to 1996, he managed Ogilvy Renault’s office in London, England.

In 1999, he became the Managing Director and Senior Advisor (Eastern Canada) at Crédit Suisse First Boston. In 2004, Fortier became Corporate Financing Director (Quebec) for TD Securities. Two days after his appointment to Cabinet Montreal Gazette columnist Ian McDonald claimed that Fortier &quot;was easily making $1 million a year running the Montreal office of TD Securities.&quot;

Fortier is Vice Chairman of RBC Capital Markets.

==Political career==

===Early career===
Fortier ran in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election but came in last with 4% of the vote. Fortier was a Progressive Conservative candidate in the Montreal-area riding of Laval West during the 2000 federal election placing fourth. In 2003, he was co-chair of Harper&#x27;s campaign to lead the new Conservative Party.

Fortier and veteran MP John Reynolds were the co-chairs of the Conservative campaign in the 2006 election.

===Cabinet minister===
Fortier was appointed to Cabinet as Minister of Public Works on 6 February 2006, the day Stephen Harper&#x27;s minority government took office. In a cabinet reshuffle in June 2008, he shifted to the International Trade portfolio.

A financier and lawyer from Montreal, he had not been elected as a member of the House of Commons at the time he was appointed, nor was he a member of the Senate. Harper announced that Fortier would be appointed to the Senate, but would be expected to step down and run for a seat in the House of Commons at the next election.

On February 27, 2006, Fortier was formally summoned to the Senate. This practice is unusual in modern Canada, but there is precedent for such a practice: in 1979, former Prime Minister Joe Clark appointed Quebec Senator Jacques Flynn Minister of Justice because of his lack of representation in that province.

In 1972, when Trudeau failed to win a single seat west of Manitoba, he appointed senators to cabinet as well. 19th century Prime Ministers John Abbott and Mackenzie Bowell served their entire terms in government as Senators.

Harper intended for Fortier to represent Montreal in Cabinet. No Montreal-area riding has elected a Conservative or any member of the party&#x27;s predecessors—the Progressive Conservatives, the Canadian Alliance and the Reform Party—since 1988. Since then, right-of-centre candidates have rarely even competed in Montreal except in landslides.

As a former member of the Canadian Cabinet, he is a member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada and thus has the right to the style The Honourable and the post-nominal designation PC for life. He is the brother of former Quebec Liberal Party MNA Margaret Delisle.

===Controversy over Senate appointment===
Fortier&#x27;s appointment to Cabinet drew considerable controversy. The main charge was that Fortier&#x27;s appointment was a significant departure from past Conservative policy. The Conservatives, and before them Reform and the Alliance, had strongly opposed Senate appointments and unelected Cabinet ministers while in opposition. Opponents of Fortier&#x27;s appointment also note that in doing so, Harper broke a promise made on Radio-Canada television during the election campaign.

As a Senator, Fortier did not attend Question Period to respond to questions from the opposition parties in the House. His Parliamentary Secretaries, James Moore at Public Works and Gerald Keddy at International Trade, answered questions on his behalf. Fortier was subject to questioning in the Senate, but the Bloc Québécois and New Democratic Party were not represented in that body (One senator, Lillian Dyck, was appointed as an NDP Senator, but the NDP opposes the existence of the Senate and does not recognize her as part of its caucus.). The Department of Public Works was at the centre of the sponsorship scandal and spends billions of dollars per year, and the Conservatives singled the department out for criticism as an example of what they saw as a lack of accountability.

Fortier himself claimed he didn&#x27;t run for a seat because &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to run in the election. I had a great career, five young kids, and so it wasn&#x27;t the right situation for me to run when the election came around. That&#x27;s just the simple truth.&quot; 

In his blog, Andrew Coyne commented that &quot;it is a fine thing for a Prime Minister elected on a platform of democratic accountability, who promised he would not appoint anyone who was not elected, either to cabinet or to the Senate, to then turn around and do both at one go.&quot; Jeffrey Simpson of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that &quot;with breathtaking insouciance, Prime Minister Stephen Harper jettisoned, or at least delayed, his promise to only elect senators&quot;. 

However, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s Chantal Hébert defended the appointments of Fortier and Emerson to Cabinet, arguing that the problem is with the first-past-the-post system which allows entire parts of the country (such as large cities) to be unrepresented in government. For example, the Conservatives were unable to win any seats in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver in the last election, while the Liberals have only won four seats in Edmonton since 1968 and have only elected three MPs from Calgary since Alberta joined Confederation in 1905.

Michael Fortier was loudly booed at the opening ceremonies of the 2006 World Outgames, an LGBT sporting event and cultural festival held in Montreal. The Conservative senator&#x27;s speech was interrupted as he attempted to welcome the estimated crowd of 40,000 at the Olympic Stadium that evening. Montreal Mayor Gérald Tremblay, who was greeted with sustained applause, intervened (unsuccessfully) to urge the crowd to listen &quot;with respect&quot; to the representative of the Canadian government.

===Promise to seek election===
On November 21, 2006, Fortier announced that he would seek election to the House of Commons in the riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges in the next federal election, which he lost. The opposition parties pressured him to run in the by-election on November 27 in Repentigny. However, Fortier repeated his original promise to run in the next general election.

===Fortier dismisses advisor connected to Julie Couillard===
Fortier confirmed June 11, 2008 that he dismissed senior Quebec adviser Bernard Cote after learning that Cote briefly dated Julie Couillard last year while she was attempting to win a government contract. Cote had to resign because of a perceived conflict of interest, since Public Works was handling the building contracts Couillard was bidding on, Fortier said. Fortier told reporters that Cote, &quot;should have actually recused himself from this matter, which he didn&#x27;t do, hence his resignation.&quot; Couillard sparked the resignation of foreign minister Maxime Bernier in May 2008 when she went public with the fact her former paramour had forgotten classified NATO briefing documents at her Montreal home for more than a month.

===2008 federal election===
While he chose not to run in an earlier by-election, Fortier was a candidate for the riding of Vaudreuil-Soulanges in the 2008 federal election, in fulfilment of his promise made at the time of his 2006 Senate appointment. In order to fulfill this promise, on September 8, 2008, he resigned from the Senate to run in the general election.

On election night, he was soundly defeated by popular Bloc Québécois incumbent Meili Faille, who captured 41.34% of the vote compared to Fortier&#x27;s 23.69%.

<text>The Oldsmobile Alero is a compact car that was produced by General Motors for its Oldsmobile division. Introduced in 1998 as a 1999 model, the Alero was the replacement for both the Achieva and Cutlass. The Alero was Oldsmobile&#x27;s last new model nameplate, and — on April 29, 2004 — was also the last Oldsmobile manufactured.

== History ==
The design of the Alero was originally previewed in 1997 with the Alero Alpha concept car, a V6-powered sport coupe that featured many design elements seen in the production Alero as well as some that were never meant for production. Its appearance was a revival of &quot;coke bottle styling&quot;, popular during the 1960s and 1970s.
The Alero was sold either as a 4-door sedan or as a 2-door coupe. It shared its chassis and many parts, including engines, with the Pontiac Grand Am. All Aleros came in base &quot;GX&quot;, mid-level &quot;GL&quot;, or high-end &quot;GLS&quot; trim; the &quot;GL&quot; trim was split into three levels: 1, 2, and 3.
The Alero experienced minimal changes during its 5-year run. Most of these changes were either in choice of engines or options. In 2003, the Alero&#x27;s daytime running lights were changed from high-beam to low-beam.

The Alero&#x27;s production ended with a special Final 500 Edition. These last 500 Aleros featured custom logos inspired by vintage Oldsmobile logos, dark cherry metallic paint, and a plate featuring the car&#x27;s number out of 500. The final Alero Final 500 Edition (#500 of 500), a &quot;GLS&quot; 4-door, also happened to be the final Oldsmobile ever built, and was signed under its hood by the employees of the General Motors Lansing plant. The final car left the Lansing Assembly Plant on April 29, 2004, and was then given to the R.E. Olds Transportation Museum. On December 15, 2017, this car was sold at auction for $42,000 to a dealer in Florida.

A preview of the planned replacement for the Alero was seen in 2001 with the unveiling of the Oldsmobile O4 concept, designed by Bertone. The car was an open-top 4-seater with European styling featuring some Oldsmobile traits, and powered by the latest &quot;Ecotec&quot; I4 engine. The name had multiple meanings, including &quot;Oldsmobile 4-Seater&quot; as well as implying 2004 as a planned date for production.

However, the O4 concept was unveiled a few weeks after General Motors announced that they would be phasing out the Oldsmobile brand, meaning that production possibilities of the O4 would never be realized. Because of this, a second generation Alero was never built and the car was phased out with the Oldsmobile brand in 2004.

=== Export markets ===
The Alero was also sold in select countries in Europe and in Israel between 1999 and 2001 as the Chevrolet Alero, and was only available as a sedan. The car still featured its Oldsmobile badges even though sold under the Chevrolet brand, but since most European consumers would not recognize the badging, Chevrolet badges were added to the grille and rear fascia for the 2000 model year. The Alero featured Chevrolet emblems throughout its entire run in Israel. The Alero was replaced in Europe, Israel, and Canada by the GM Daewoo-sourced Chevrolet Evanda.

== Trim levels ==
During its production, the Alero was available in four trim levels, all available in coupe or sedan body styles:

The GX was the most basic trim level of the Alero. It included such features as a 2.4 L inline four-cylinder engine, 5-speed manual transmission, an AM/FM stereo (later, AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player) with a four-speaker sound system, 15-inch black-painted steel wheels with decorative wheel covers, manual windows, power door locks, full instrumentation, air conditioning, velour door panel inserts, and cloth seating surfaces. The 3.4 L V6 engine available on all other Alero trim levels was not available on the base GX trim level.

The GL was the midrange trim level of the Alero. It added the following features to the base GX trim level: an AM/FM stereo with cassette player (not applicable for later models), power windows, and 16-inch alloy wheels. The 3.4 L V6 engine was available as an option, though was standard equipment on the GL2 trim level. The GL1 trim level also offered the V6 engine option.

The GLS trim level was the &quot;luxury&quot; trim level of the Alero. It added the following features to the already well-equipped GL trim level: an AM/FM stereo with cassette and single-disc CD player (later, an MP3-decoding single-disc CD player was added), an eight-speaker &quot;premium&quot; sound system with amplifier, keyless entry, power driver seat, leather upholstery and a security system. The 3.4 L V6 engine was standard for this trim level.

== Engines ==
== Variant prototypes ==

General Motors commissioned the construction of Alero prototypes either for testing or to gather public opinion on possible future plans for the Alero. These variants include:
* Alero OSV - &quot;Oldsmobile Speciality Vehicle&quot;, an experiment in an aftermarket parts brand for Oldsmobile. Based on the coupe it featured a custom body kit, a supercharged four-cylinder engine, custom interior, and special cherry red paint with ghosted Oldsmobile emblems in the rear quarter panels.
* Alero OSV II - Another experimental vehicle, this time featuring an LX5 DOHC 3.5 L V6 (used in the Oldsmobile Intrigue and Aurora) and featured custom dark green paint.
* Alero 442 - A set of show cars based on the Alero coupe fitted with a body kit similar in design to the Oldsmobile 442. Each Alero 442 show car had a unique color, including white with gold stripes and white with pink stripes.
* Alero California - A custom built version of the Alero coupe featuring parts including a large rear wing, racing seats, sport tires, and custom graphics painted in brown and yellow.
* Alero Convertible - An experiment in the possibility of creating an Alero with a convertible soft top to help broaden the appeal of the car to young buyers. The Oldsmobile O4 concept also hinted that the next generation Alero could have had a convertible model.
* Alero Pace Car - Built by General Motors as part of their fleet of Oldsmobile safety cars for the Indy Racing League, featuring custom yellow, blue and white checkered flag graphics.

== Safety ==
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the 1999–2005 Grand Am (which was built on the same platform as the 1999–2004 Alero) a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in its frontal crash test for its marginal structural integrity, a possible head injury, a potential right leg injury, and poor dummy control.

The following are 2003 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test ratings for the Alero.

<doc id="626067" wikidata="Q1622359" url="?curid=626067" title="Abraham Van Helsing">
<text>Professor Abraham Van Helsing () is a fictional character from the 1897 gothic horror novel &quot;Dracula&quot; written by Bram Stoker. Van Helsing is a Dutch polymath doctor with a wide range of interests and accomplishments, partly attested by the string of letters that follows his name: &quot;MD, D.Ph., D.Litt., etc.&quot;, indicating a wealth of experience, education and expertise. He is a doctor, professor, lawyer, philosopher, scientist, and metaphysician. The character is best known through many adaptations of the story as a vampire slayer, monster hunter and the arch-nemesis of Count Dracula, and the prototypical and the archetypal parapsychologist in subsequent works of paranormal fiction. Some later works tell new stories about Van Helsing, while others, such as &quot;Dracula&quot; (2020) and &quot;I Woke Up a Vampire&quot; (2023) have characters that are his descendants.
== &quot;Dracula&quot; ==

In the novel, Professor Van Helsing is called in by his former student, John Seward, to assist with the mysterious illness of Lucy Westenra. Van Helsing&#x27;s friendship with Seward is based in part upon an unknown prior event in which Van Helsing suffered a grievous wound, and Seward saved his life by sucking out the gangrene. It is Van Helsing who first realizes that Lucy is the victim of a vampire, and he guides Seward and his friends in their efforts to save Lucy.

Van Helsing had a son who died. He says that his son, had he lived, would have had a similar appearance to Lucy&#x27;s suitor Arthur Holmwood (&quot;My heart bleed for that poor boy, that dear boy, so of the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his hair and eyes the same&quot;). Consequently, Van Helsing developed a particular fondness for Holmwood. Van Helsing&#x27;s wife went insane from grief after their son&#x27;s death, but as a Catholic, he refuses to divorce her (&quot;with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church&#x27;s law, though no wits, all gone, even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife&quot;).

Van Helsing is one of the few characters in the novel who is fully physically described in one place. In chapter 14, Mina Harker describes him as:
Van Helsing&#x27;s personality is described by John Seward, his former student, thus:
In the novel, Van Helsing is described as having what is apparently a thick foreign accent, in that he speaks in broken English and he uses German phrases such as &quot;Mein Gott&quot; ().

Adaptations of the novel have tended to play up Van Helsing&#x27;s role as a vampire expert, sometimes to the extent that it is depicted as his major occupation. In the novel, however, Dr. Seward requests Van Helsing&#x27;s assistance simply because Lucy&#x27;s affliction has him baffled and Van Helsing &quot;knows as much about obscure diseases as anyone in the world&quot;.

=== Development ===
In an 1897 interview in &quot;The British Weekly&quot;, Stoker said that Van Helsing was &quot;founded on a real character&quot;. In Stoker&#x27;s 1898 introduction to the Swedish and Icelandic versions of &quot;Dracula&quot;, he writes from an in-universe perspective that &quot;the highly regarded scientist, who appears under a pseudonym here, may likewise be too famous throughout the educated world for his real name − which I prefer not to mention − to remain hidden from the public, especially from those people who have learned firsthand to appreciate and respect his brilliant mind and masterly skill, though they no more adhere to his views on life than I do.&quot;

Van Helsing may have been inspired by characters from Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1871–72), including Dr Martin Hesselius, &quot;who makes little comment upon the strange narrative he introduces&quot;, and Baron Vordenburg, &quot;who has read &#x27;all the great and little works&#x27; on vampires and who has &#x27;extracted a system of principles&#x27; that govern vampire existence&quot;.

=== Narrative ===

Count Dracula, having acquired ownership of the Carfax estate near London through solicitor Jonathan Harker, moves to the estate and begins menacing England. His victims include Lucy Westenra, who is on holiday in Whitby. The aristocratic girl has suitors such as John Seward, Arthur Holmwood, and Quincey Morris, and has a best friend in Mina Murray, Harker&#x27;s fiancée. Seward, who works as a doctor in an insane asylum – where one of the patients, the incurably mad Renfield, has a psychic connection to Dracula – contacts Professor Van Helsing about Lucy&#x27;s peculiar condition. Van Helsing, recognizing marks upon her neck, eventually deduces that she has been losing blood from a vampire bite. He administers multiple blood transfusions. Van Helsing, Seward, Arthur, and Morris each donate blood to her, but each night she continues to lose blood. He prescribes her garlic, makes a necklace of garlic flowers for her, and hangs garlic about her room. He also gives her a crucifix to wear around her neck. Lucy&#x27;s demise was brought by her mother, who cleared the room of garlic and opened the window for fresh air; a servant had stolen the gold crucifix. Lucy dies and after the funeral returns as a vampire, seeking out children. Eventually, Van Helsing, Arthur, Morris and Seward free the undead Lucy from her vampiric curse: Arthur uses a hammer to drive the stake through her heart and Van Helsing cuts off her head and puts garlic in her mouth.

Mina, now married to Harker, becomes increasingly worried about his brain fever. Van Helsing reviews his journal and Harker&#x27;s health returns when he learns that his experiences in Transylvania were real. Mina discovers that various letters and accounts provide further intelligence on Dracula&#x27;s movements, and shares these with Harker, Seward, Morris, and Van Helsing. They learn that Dracula&#x27;s residence in Carfax is near Seward&#x27;s, and Van Helsing&#x27;s research reveals Dracula&#x27;s weaknesses and strengths. Seward and Van Helsing also write to a university acquaintance to aid in further research. Staying at Seward&#x27;s residence to better plan strategies in their efforts to deal with Dracula, they have frequent meetings and each member is assigned duties. At a later meeting a bat is seen at a window.

To destroy Dracula and prevent further spread of evil, the party enters his estate at Carfax and as a group encounters him for the first time. They discover that he has been purchasing properties in and around London, with plans to distribute 50 boxes of Transylvanian earth to them, used as graves so each property would become a safe lair. They visit these lairs and place sacramental bread in the boxes of the earth to &quot;sterilize&quot; them, preventing Dracula from further using them. Dracula entices Renfield to invite him into Seward&#x27;s residence. Renfield is found critically injured by Seward and Van Helsing who operate on him, and Renfield informs them that Dracula went to see Mina. They go to Mina&#x27;s room and find Harker hypnotized while Dracula is giving Mina the &#x27;Vampire&#x27;s Baptism of Blood&#x27;, cursing her and the group for plotting against him. The party uses sacred items to repel Dracula, who flees into a different room as a vapor. Dracula then destroys all the texts Mina had produced, except for one which was hidden, and breaks Renfield&#x27;s neck before leaving.

Van Helsing places a wafer of sacramental bread upon Mina&#x27;s forehead to bless her but it burns her flesh, leaving a scar. Mina, feeling that she is now connected with Dracula, asks Van Helsing to hypnotize her before dawn, the only time she feels she could freely speak. Through this hypnosis they learn that Mina has a telepathic link with Dracula, that she could tell everything he hears and feels, which could be used to track his movements. Mina agrees that any plans should be kept from her for fear that Dracula could read her thoughts. The group has additional encounters with Dracula as they continue to search for his residences throughout London and sterilize the boxes. Learning that his final grave is aboard a boat, Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is fleeing back to his castle.

When the party pursues Dracula to Transylvania, they split into groups. While Mina and Van Helsing travel straight to Dracula&#x27;s castle, the others attempt to ambush the boat on which Dracula is a passenger. Van Helsing&#x27;s influence over Mina diminishes each day, and her behavior changes as she sleeps more during the day, loses her appetite for food, and ceases to write in her journal. He finds that she cannot cross a circle of crumbled sacramental bread. Later, Dracula&#x27;s vampiric wives approach their camp but they too are unable to cross into the circle of bread. Failing at their attempts to lure Van Helsing and Mina out of the circle, they flee back to Dracula&#x27;s castle just before sunrise. Van Helsing binds Mina at a cave to keep her from danger as he goes into Dracula&#x27;s castle to kill the vampires.

As Van Helsing runs through the castle searching its rooms, he finds Dracula&#x27;s empty tomb and the three female vampires he saw earlier. He begins to do his operation on the first vampire but finds himself entranced by her beauty and unable to bring himself to harm her. In his feelings of enchantment, he even contemplates love for her. He is broken out of this enchantment when he hears a &quot;soul wail&quot; from Mina, awakening him. He proceeds to drive stakes into their hearts and sever their heads, one by one.

Van Helsing returns to Mina and they see the rest of their party as they chase a group of gypsies down the Borgo Pass and corner them. Armed with knives and firearms they overtake the gypsies and open the final box of Dracula; Jonathan Harker brings his Kukri knife down on Dracula&#x27;s throat as the bowie knife of Quincey Morris simultaneously impales Dracula&#x27;s heart in the final moments of daylight. At this moment Dracula&#x27;s body crumbles to dust. After the struggle, Quincey is seen to have been fatally wounded.

Six years later, Van Helsing takes a grandfatherly role in regard to the young Quincey Harker, Jonathan and Mina&#x27;s son.

== Equipment ==
Van Helsing is seen utilising many tools to aid him and his party in fending off Dracula, warding off vampires and in general defeating the undead:
* Skeleton keys used for lock picking to open the doors to many of Dracula&#x27;s lairs located throughout London.
* Wreath of withered garlic blossoms
* Silver crucifix
* Sacred wafer brought from Amsterdam contained in an envelope or crushed and sprinkled around him in a circle as a protective barrier.
* Electric lamps which could be attached or secured against the chest.
* Revolver and knife for use against enemies weaker than Dracula.
* The branch of a wild rose could be placed on top of a coffin containing a vampire, immobilising it.
* Mountain ash used to repel the undead.
* Wooden stake and hammer to pierce a vampire&#x27;s heart.
* Golden crucifix necklace, given to Lucy.

== On screen ==
=== Film adaptations of the novel ===
* &quot;Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror&quot; (1922) was the first film version of &quot;Dracula&quot;. Although it followed the same basic plot as the novel, names were changed: Van Helsing is &#x27;Professor Bulwer&#x27; (John Gottowt) and appears only in a few scenes. Unlike the book, he is a friend of &#x27;Thomas Hutter&#x27; (the film&#x27;s version of Jonathan Harker) before he meets &#x27;Count Orlok&#x27; (a renamed Count Dracula), and he never meets the vampire face to face.
* In the initial 1931 Universal version of &quot;Dracula&quot; starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, Professor Van Helsing was portrayed by the actor Edward Van Sloan, who had previously played the part opposite Lugosi on stage. Van Sloan was the only cast member to reprise his role in the sequel &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1936).
* Eduardo Arozamena portrayed Van Helsing in Universal&#x27;s simultaneously shot Spanish &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931).

* Peter Cushing&#x27;s Doctor Van Helsing in the initial 1958 Hammer &quot;Dracula&quot; movie and its 1960 sequel &quot;The Brides of Dracula&quot; differed from the novel&#x27;s in that the actor portrayed the character as a visibly younger man (as did Christopher Lee as the Count), and also one whose main vocation appears to be vampire hunting. His first name is never mentioned, though in the later Hammer Dracula films set in the 1970s (which apparently exist on a different timeline) Lee&#x27;s Dracula battles Cushing&#x27;s &#x27;Lorrimer Van Helsing&#x27;, a grandson of a previous vampire hunter, who appears as &#x27;Lawrence Van Helsing&#x27; (also Cushing) in the prologue to &quot;Dracula A.D. 1972&quot;. In the final Hammer Dracula production &quot;The Legend of the 7 Golden Vampires&quot; (set mainly in 1904) Cushing again plays the original Van Helsing from the Hammer series.
* Herbert Lom played Van Helsing in &quot;Count Dracula&quot; (1970). 
* Walter Ladengast played Van Helsing in &quot;Nosferatu the Vampyre&quot; (1979), a remake of the 1922 film. Here, he actually encounters the Count in catatonic state after he got paralysed by the sun and stakes him. 
* John Badham&#x27;s 1979 version of &quot;Dracula&quot; saw Laurence Olivier portray Van Helsing as a frail old man whose daughter becomes one of the undead, drawing him into a conflict with Frank Langella&#x27;s Count that eventually costs the Professor his life.

* Anthony Hopkins portrayed Professor Van Helsing in &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; in 1992. Once again implied to be a knowledgeable, and immensely experienced vampire hunter, this Van Helsing often comes across as somewhat eccentric and unbalanced, casually discussing how to kill the un-dead despite the brutal methods involved, and displaying ruthlessness when dispatching Dracula&#x27;s brides, but he nevertheless leads a group of friends to victory over the Count.
* In the 1995 spoof film &quot;&quot;, the movie&#x27;s director Mel Brooks plays Professor Van Helsing.
* David Moroni portrayed Van Helsing in &quot;&quot; (2002), a black and white movie version of the Royal Winnipeg ballet adaptation of the novel.
* Rutger Hauer in &quot;Dracula 3D&quot; (2012). In this version it is revealed that he used to control an insane asylum called Carfax, and it was there that he first encountered vampires.
* Keith Reay in &quot;Dracula Reborn&quot; (2012). The setting is modernized to present-day California and Van Helsing here is a relatively young and brutal vampire hunter, who is ready to kill people if they get in the way of vanquishing vampires.
* Christine Prouty in &quot;Dracula: The Original Living Vampire&quot; (2022). Here, Van Helsing is gender-swapped, now being a detective who is Mina&#x27;s girlfriend, and a friend of chemist Jonathan Harker and Doctor Jack Seward. She doesn&#x27;t believe in vampires and always relies on logic in contrast to Harker, who is convinced that there are vampires among them. She only believes this when she is forced to near the end of the film, and even then she is reluctant. After the battle with Dracula, it is revealed she has become a vampire.
* Willem Dafoe in &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, a remake of the 1922 film. This iteration, renamed Albin Eberhart Von Franz, is a scientist who fell from grace after devoting his studies to the occult. Von Franz is quick to recognize that Ellen (Mina&#x27;s counterpart) is under the influence of Count Orlok (Dracula&#x27;s analog) and conspires with her to defeat him, taking Thomas Hutter and Wilhelm Sievers (a renamed John Seward) to Orlok&#x27;s manor while she sacrifices herself.

* Peter Fonda in &quot;Nadja&quot; (1994)

When Dracula escapes after his coffin is stolen, Van Helsing&#x27;s daughter and his assistant are able to defeat him after the elder Van Helsing&#x27;s death.
* Hugh Jackman played Gabriel Van Helsing, in &quot;Van Helsing&quot; (2004) alongside costars Kate Beckinsale and Richard Roxburgh, loosely based on Stoker&#x27;s character. Having been found on the steps of a church several years before with total amnesia, Gabriel hunts monsters for a secret organization made up of the world&#x27;s religions (known as the Knights of the Holy Order) to rid the world of evil &quot;that the rest of mankind has no idea exists&quot;, although he is the most wanted man in Europe for his conspicuous actions. In the movie he is sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula. When he arrives, Dracula tells Gabriel that they have already met and have quite a history together, with Dracula revealing over the course of the film that Van Helsing was the one who originally murdered him, as well as claiming ownership of a distinctive ring that Van Helsing has worn as long as he can remember. It is heavily implied that Gabriel is actually the angel Gabriel, with vague references to Dracula&#x27;s murderer as the &quot;Left Hand of God&quot;. Jackman also voiced the character in the animated spin-off &quot;Van Helsing: The London Assignment&quot; (2004).

== Appearances in other media ==
=== On stage ===
* In 1924 play &quot;Dracula&quot; by Hamilton Deane Van Helsing is portrayed as the arch-nemesis of Dracula. Deane himself played the role in British productions of the play. In 1927 the play was brought to Broadway by producer Horace Liveright, who hired John L. Balderston to revise the script for American audiences. The role of Van Helsing on Broadway was played by Edward Van Sloan. It is due to this play and its adaptation into 1931 film, that the notion of Van Helsing as Dracula&#x27;s arch-enemy was introduced into popular culture (in the novel the two never had any conversations and Dracula never singled out Van Helsing out of the group of people who were after him).
* Van Helsing was played by Stephen Henderson in 2004 Broadway production of &quot;Dracula, the Musical&quot; by Frank Wildhorn.
* Van Helsing was played by Pierre Flynn in the 2006 French Canadian musical &quot;Dracula – Entre l&#x27;amour et la mort&quot;.

=== Novels ===
* The Robert Statzer novel &quot;To Love a Vampire&quot; () chronicles Van Helsing&#x27;s days as a medical student, depicting his first confrontation with the occult during an encounter with Countess Elizabeth Báthory and her niece, Carmilla Karnstein. Originally published as a serial in the pages of &quot;Scary Monsters Magazine&quot; from March 2011 to June 2013, a revised version of &quot;To Love a Vampire&quot; was reprinted in paperback and Kindle editions in June 2018.
* In the 2009 Dacre Stoker novel &quot;Dracula the Un-dead&quot;, Van Helsing is now a 75-year-old man with heart problems, having apparently been disgraced in the medical profession for deaths caused by improper blood transfusions (although he defends his reputation by arguing that nobody knew about blood types until much later); he was also briefly a suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders due to his knowledge of anatomy and reputation for mutilating corpses for unspecified reasons. He later becomes a vampire himself after a meeting with Dracula revealed that Dracula was actually hunting the &quot;true&quot; monster of Elizabeth Báthory, but Van Helsing is killed in a confrontation with Arthur Holmwood, as Holmwood cannot accept the revelation that they were hunting the wrong threat. Holmwood throws himself at Van Helsing, causing the pair to fall out of a window and be impaled on the fence below.
* P. N. Elrod&#x27;s novel &quot;Quincey Morris, Vampire&quot; takes up the story almost immediately after the conclusion of Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, but in this story (which shows vampires in a more sympathetic light) Van Helsing is unyielding and unwavering in his beliefs and his hatred of vampires to the point where he eventually alienates his former friends and allies.
* In Edward M. Erdelac&#x27;s 2012 epistolary novel, Terovolas, Van Helsing suffers a bout of madness stemming from his encounter with Dracula&#x27;s brides, and commits himself to Seward&#x27;s care. Upon release, he voluntarily bears the personal effects of Quincey Morris back to the Morris family ranch in Texas, only to be embroiled in more supernatural doings related to a group of enigmatic Norwegian ranchers.
* The comic novel &quot;Dracula&#x27;s Diary&quot; by Michael Geare and Michael Corby () completely re-tells the Stoker novel, with the young Count Dracula (who has been learning to act like a true British gentleman) becoming a secret agent for Her Majesty&#x27;s government and Van Helsing an enemy agent for a foreign power who is continually thwarted by Dracula.
* In &quot;The Dracula Tapes&quot; (1975) by Fred Saberhagen, a psychotic, fanatical, bumbling Van Helsing opposes the urbane, if ruthless, Dracula.
* In &quot;Fangland&quot; by John Marks, the re-imagined Van Helsing is split into two separate characters, namely Clementine Spence and Austen Trotta.
* He also appears in the &quot;Department 19&quot; series by Will Hill.
* In the 2017 novel &quot;A Betrayal in Blood&quot; by Mark A. Lathan, Mycroft Holmes asks his brother Sherlock to investigate Van Helsing&#x27;s &#x27;Crew of Light&#x27; after they have been cleared of murder charges due to Dracula&#x27;s vampiric nature. In the course of the investigation, Holmes and Dr. Watson realize that Van Helsing is actually a &#x27;retired&#x27; German spy who manipulated Seward and the Harkers in assisting his campaign against Dracula, Seward through his loyalty and the Harkers through blackmail of their role in the death of Jonathan&#x27;s former employer. He also arranged for the death of Quincey Morris, and is all but explicitly stated to have manipulated Holmwood into his new marriage to a woman who owes Van Helsing unspecified favours. Holmes deduces that in reality, Dracula was &quot;never&quot; a vampire; Van Helsing faked all relevant evidence, such as hiring an actress with a passing resemblance to Lucy to attack children after her death. In reality Dracula was a reclusive old man and a former spy himself, whose only crime was a long-ago affair with Van Helsing&#x27;s wife, this affair producing a son who was given up for adoption to become Arthur Holmwood. At the conclusion of the case, Van Helsing commits suicide by shooting himself in a train bathroom while Holmes and Watson are taking him back to England to stand trial after a final confrontation in Translyvania.
* At the end of the novel &quot;Dracul&quot;, the official prequel to the novel by Bram Stoker co-written by Dacre Stoker and J. D. Barker, it is suggested by a dialogue between Bram Stoker and Mina Harker that Van Helsing and Ármin Vámbéry could be the same person.

=== Radio and audio ===
* In radio drama &quot;Dracula&quot; by &quot;The Mercury Theatre on the Air&quot;, which was broadcast in 1938, Van Helsing was played by Martin Gabel. Dracula was played by Orson Welles.
* In the Big Finish Productions audio drama &quot;The Tangled Skein&quot; (adapted from the novella by David Stuart Davies) Van Helsing, acting alone, joins forces with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to investigate the presence of vampires in London. Although initially disbelieving of Van Helsing&#x27;s convictions when they read about his lectures on vampires, the duo accept his word when they are confronted and nearly killed by a vampire in Hampstead Heath, joining Van Helsing in staking the vampire. While Van Helsing is forced to focus on his lectures over the next few days, he leaves his vampire-hunting equipment with Holmes and Watson, who track Dracula to Dartmoor, where he has hidden in Baskerville Hall, and are able to defeat him using Van Helsing&#x27;s advice. After Dracula is defeated when trapped in the Grimpen Mire as the sun rises, Holmes gives Van Helsing Dracula&#x27;s ring as a memento of their victory, concluding that Van Helsing&#x27;s research is what enabled him to destroy Dracula.

=== Comics ===

Abraham Van Helsing was also portrayed in &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; Marvel Comics series, which was based on the characters of Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel including his great-granddaughter Rachel Van Helsing.

In the Marvel Comics miniseries &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse vs. Dracula&quot;, Van Helsing joins forces with the immortal mutant Apocalypse and his worshipers, Clan Akkaba, in order to destroy Dracula, their common enemy. It is noted that Van Helsing had encountered Apocalypse before and previously believed him to be a vampire.

In the Italian comic book &quot;Martin Mystère&quot; and the spin-off series &quot;Storie di Altrove/Stories from Elsewhere&quot;, Van Helsing&#x27;s name is Richard. He was originally a knight in the service of the Holy Roman Emperors but he was captured in 1475 by the undead warriors of the Order of the Dragon and turned into a vampire by the Wallachian Prince Vlad Dracula. Four centuries later, Van Helsing killed Dracula, and later came to London to solve the case of Jack the Ripper, eventually discovering that the murderers were mentally controlled by demons from another world. In 1902 he worked together with the resurrected Dracula to prevent the assassination of King Edward VII.

He pursues Count Duckula relentlessly, never able to comprehend that Duckula is actually completely harmless. He is a terrible scientist, often getting injured by his own crackpot inventions, and he is supremely unobservant, often bumping into Duckula and conversing with him for several minutes without realising to whom he is speaking.

<doc id="626072" wikidata="Q1236263" url="?curid=626072" title="Dead zone (ecology)">
<text>Dead zones are hypoxic (low-oxygen) areas in the world&#x27;s oceans and large lakes. Hypoxia occurs when dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration falls to or below 2 ml of O2/liter. When a body of water experiences hypoxic conditions, aquatic flora and fauna begin to change behavior in order to reach sections of water with higher oxygen levels. Once DO declines below 0.5 ml O2/liter in a body of water, mass mortality occurs. With such a low concentration of DO, these bodies of water fail to support the aquatic life living there. Historically, many of these sites were naturally occurring. However, in the 1970s, oceanographers began noting increased instances and expanses of dead zones. These occur near inhabited coastlines, where aquatic life is most concentrated.

Coastal regions, such as the Baltic Sea, the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the Chesapeake Bay, as well as large enclosed water bodies like Lake Erie, have been affected by deoxygenation due to eutrophication. Excess nutrients are input into these systems by rivers, ultimately from urban and agricultural runoff and exacerbated by deforestation. These nutrients lead to high productivity that produces organic material that sinks to the bottom and is respired. The respiration of that organic material uses up the oxygen and causes hypoxia or anoxia.

The UN Environment Programme reported 146 dead zones in 2004 in the world&#x27;s oceans where marine life could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometer (0.4 mi2), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometers (27,000 mi2). A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.

==Causes==

Aquatic and marine dead zones can be caused by an increase in nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water, known as eutrophication. These nutrients are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. With more available nutrients, single-celled aquatic organisms (such as algae and cyanobacteria) have the resources necessary to exceed their previous growth limit and begin to multiply at an exponential rate. Exponential growth leads to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these phytoplankton, a phenomenon known as an algal bloom.

Limnologist David Schindler, whose research at the Experimental Lakes Area led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones, &quot;The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven&#x27;t gone away; they&#x27;ve moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here...This isn&#x27;t just a prairie problem. Global expansion of dead zones caused by algal blooms is rising rapidly.&quot;

The major groups of algae are cyanobacteria, green algae, dinoflagellates, coccolithophores and diatom algae. An increase in the input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes cyanobacteria to bloom. Other algae are consumed and thus do not accumulate to the same extent as cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of hypoxia.

Dead zones can be caused by natural and by anthropogenic factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling, changes in wind, and water circulation patterns. Other environmental factors that determine the occurrence or intensity of a dead zone include long water residence times, high temperatures, and high levels of sunlight penetration through the water column.

Additionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as fjords or the Black Sea, have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be trapped there for a long time. The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed. These areas are also known as oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). In many cases, OMZs are permanent or semi-permanent areas.

Remains of organisms found within sediment layers near the mouth of the Mississippi River indicate four hypoxic events before the advent of synthetic fertilizer. In these sediment layers, anoxia-tolerant species are the most prevalent remains found. The periods indicated by the sediment record correspond to historic records of high river flow recorded by instruments at Vicksburg, Mississippi.

Changes in ocean circulation triggered by ongoing climate change could also add or magnify other causes of oxygen reductions in the ocean.

Anthropogenic causes include use of chemical fertilizers and their subsequent presence in water runoff and groundwater, direct sewage discharge into rivers and lakes, and nutrient discharge into groundwater from large, accumulated quantities of animal waste. Use of chemical fertilizers is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. However, runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.

In August 2017, a report suggested that the US meat industry and agroeconomic system are predominantly responsible for the largest-ever dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Soil runoff and leached nitrate, exacerbated by agricultural land management and tillage practices as well as manure and synthetic fertilizer usage, contaminated water from the Heartland to the Gulf of Mexico. A large portion of the plant matter by-products from crops grown in this region are used as major feed components in the production of meat animals for agribusiness companies, like Tyson and Smithfield Foods. Over 86% of the livestock feed is inedible for humans.

Notable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region, surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years. Around the world, dead zones have developed in continental seas, such as the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, Black Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and East China Sea, all of which are major fishery areas.

== Types ==

Dead zones can be classified by type, and are identified by the length of their occurrence:
* Permanent dead zones are deep water occurrences that rarely exceed 2 milligrams per liter.
* Temporary dead zones are short lived dead zones lasting hours or days.
* Seasonal dead zones are annually occurring, typically in warm months of summer and autumn.
* Diel cycling hypoxia is a specific seasonal dead zone that only becomes hypoxic during the night
The type of dead zone can, in some ways, be categorized by the time required for the water to return to full health. This time frame depends on the intensity of eutrophication and level of oxygen depletion. A water body that sinks to anoxic conditions and experiences extreme reduction in community diversity will have to travel a much longer path to return to full health. A water body that only experiences mild hypoxia and maintains community diversity and maturity will require a much shorter path length to return to full health.

==Effects==

The most notable effects of eutrophication are vegetal blooms, sometimes toxic, loss of biodiversity and anoxia, which can lead to the massive death of aquatic organisms.

Due to the hypoxic conditions present in dead zones, marine life within these areas tends to be scarce. Most fish and motile organisms tend to emigrate out of the zone as oxygen concentrations fall, and benthic populations may experience severe losses when oxygen concentrations are below 0.5 mg l−1 O2. In severe anoxic conditions, microbial life may experience dramatic shifts in community identity as well, resulting in an increased abundance of anaerobic organisms as aerobic microbes decrease in number and switch energy sources for oxidation such as nitrate, sulfate, or iron reduction. Sulfur reduction is a particular concern as Hydrogen sulfide is toxic and stresses most organisms within the zone further, exacerbating mortality risks.

Low oxygen levels can have severe effects on survivability of organisms inside the area while above lethal anoxic conditions. Studies conducted along the Gulf Coast of North America have shown hypoxic conditions lead to reduction of reproductive rates and growth rates in a variety of organisms including fish and benthic invertebrates. Organisms able to leave the area typically do so when oxygen concentrations decrease to less than 2 mg l−1. At these oxygen concentrations and below, organisms that survive inside the oxygen deficient environment and are unable to escape the area will often exhibit progressively worsening stress behavior and die. Surviving organisms tolerant of hypoxic conditions often exhibit physiological adaptations appropriate for persisting within hypoxic environments. Examples of such adaptations include increased efficiency of oxygen intake and use, lowering required amount of oxygen intake through reduced growth rates or dormancy, and increasing the usage of anaerobic metabolic pathways.

Community composition in benthic communities is dramatically disrupted by periodic oxygen depletion events, such as those of seasonal dead zones and occurring as a result of Diel cycles. The longterm effects of such hypoxic conditions result in a shift in communities, most commonly manifest as a decrease in species diversity through mass mortality events. Reestablishment of benthic communities depend upon composition of adjacent communities for larval recruitment. This results in a shift towards faster establishing colonizers with shorter and more opportunistic life strategies, potentially disrupting historic benthic compositions.

=== Fisheries ===
The influence of dead zones on fisheries and other marine commercial activities varies by the length of occurrence and location. Dead zones are often accompanied by a decrease in biodiversity and collapse in benthic populations, lowering the diversity of yield in commercial fishing operations, but in cases of eutrophication-related dead zone formations, the increase in nutrient availability can lead to temporary rises in select yields among pelagic populations, such as anchovies. However, studies estimate that the increased production in the surrounding areas do not offset the net decrease in productivity resulting from the dead zone. For instance, an estimated 17,000 MT of carbon in the form of prey for fisheries has been lost as a result of dead zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, many stressors in fisheries are worsened by hypoxic conditions. Indirect factors such as increased success by invasive species and increased pandemic intensity in stressed species such as oysters both lead to losses in revenue and ecological stability in affected regions.

=== Coral reefs ===

There has been a severe increase in mass mortality events associated with low oxygen causing mass hypoxia with the majority having been in the last 2 decades. The rise in water temperature leads to an increase in oxygen demand and the increase for ocean deoxygenation which causes these large coral reef dead zones. For many coral reefs, the response to this hypoxia is very dependent on the magnitude and duration of the deoxygenation. The symptoms can be anywhere from reduced photosynthesis and calcification to bleaching. Hypoxia can have indirect effects like the abundance of algae and spread of coral diseases in the ecosystems. While coral is unable to handle such low levels of oxygen, algae is quite tolerant. Because of this, in interaction zones between algae and coral, increased hypoxia will cause more coral death and higher spread of algae. The increase mass coral dead zones is reinforced by the spread of coral diseases. Coral diseases can spread easily when there are high concentrations of sulfide and hypoxic conditions. Due to the loop of hypoxia and coral reef mortality, the fish and other marine life that inhabit the coral reefs have a change in behavioral in response to the hypoxia. Some fish will go upwards to find more oxygenated water, and some enter a phase of metabolic and ventilatory depression. Invertebrates migrate out of their homes to the surface of substratum or move to the tips of arborescent coral colonies.

Around six million people, the majority who live in developing countries, depend on coral reef fisheries. These mass die-offs due to extreme hypoxic events can have severe impacts on reef fish populations. Coral reef ecosystems offer a variety of essential ecosystem services including shoreline protection, nitrogen fixation, and waste assimilation, and tourism opportunities. The continued decline of oxygen in oceans on coral reefs is concerning because it takes many years (decades) to repair and regrow corals.

=== Jellyfish blooms ===
Despite most other life forms being killed by the lack of oxygen, jellyfish can thrive and are sometimes present in dead zones in vast numbers. Jellyfish blooms produce large quantities of mucus, leading to major changes in food webs in the ocean since few organisms feed on them. The organic carbon in mucus is metabolized by bacteria which return it to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide in what has been termed a &quot;jelly carbon shunt&quot;. The potential worsening of jellyfish blooms as a result of human activities has driven new research into the influence of dead zones on jelly populations. The primary concern is the potential for dead zones to serve as breeding grounds for jelly populations as a result of the hypoxic conditions driving away competition for resources and common predators of jellyfish. The increased population of jellyfish could have high commercial costs with loss of fisheries, destruction and contamination of trawling nets and fishing vessels, and lowered tourism revenue in coastal systems.

=== Seagrass beds ===
Globally, seagrass has been declining rapidly. It is estimated that 21% of the 71 known seagrass species have decreasing population trends and 11% of those species have been designated as threatened on the ICUN Red List. Hypoxia that leads to eutrophication caused from ocean deoxygenation is one of the main underlying factors of these die-offs. Eutrophication causes enhanced nutrient enrichment which can result in seagrass productivity, but with continual nutrient enrichment in seagrass meadows, it can cause excessive growth of microalgae, epiphytes and phytoplankton resulting in hypoxic conditions.

Seagrass is both a source and a sink for oxygen in the surrounding water column and sediments. At night, the inner part of seagrass oxygen pressure is linearly related to the oxygen concentration in the water column, so low water column oxygen concentrations often result in hypoxic seagrass tissues, which can eventually kill off the seagrass. Normally, seagrass sediments must supply oxygen to the below-ground tissue through either photosynthesis or by diffusing oxygen from the water column through leaves to rhizomes and roots. However, with the change in seagrass oxygen balances, it can often result in hypoxic seagrass tissues. Seagrass exposed to this hypoxic water column show increased respiration, reduced rates of photosynthesis, smaller leaves, and reduced number of leaves per shoot. This causes insufficient supply of oxygen to the belowground tissues for aerobic respiration, so seagrass must rely on the less-efficient anaerobic respiration. Seagrass die-offs create a positive feedback loop in which the mortality events cause more death as higher oxygen demands are created when dead plant material decomposes.

Because hypoxia increases the invasion of sulfides in seagrass, this negatively affects seagrass through photosynthesis, metabolism and growth. Generally, seagrass is able to combat the sulfides by supplying enough oxygen to the roots. However, deoxygenation causes the seagrass to be unable to supply this oxygen, thus killing it off.

Deoxygenation reduces the diversity of organisms inhabiting seagrass beds by eliminating species that cannot tolerate the low oxygen conditions. Indirectly, the loss and degradation of seagrass threatens numerous species that rely on seagrass for either shelter or food. The loss of seagrass also effects the physical characteristics and resilience of seagrass ecosystems. Seagrass beds provide nursery grounds and habitat to many harvested commercial, recreational, and subsistence fish and shellfish. In many tropical regions, local people are dependent on seagrass associated fisheries as a source of food and income.

Seagrass also provides many ecosystem services including water purification, coastal protection, erosion control, sequestration and delivery of trophic subsidies to adjacent marine and terrestrial habitats. Continued deoxygenation causes the effects of hypoxia to be compounded by climate change which will increase the decline in seagrass populations.

=== Mangrove forests ===
Compared to seagrass beds and coral reefs, hypoxia is more common on a regular basis in mangrove ecosystems, though ocean deoxygenation is compounding the negative effects by anthropogenic nutrient inputs and land use modification.

Like seagrass, mangrove trees transport oxygen to roots of rhizomes, reduce sulfide concentrations, and alter microbial communities. Dissolved oxygen is more readily consumed in the interior of the mangrove forest. Anthropogenic inputs may push the limits of survival in many mangrove microhabitats. For example, shrimp ponds constructed in mangrove forests are considered the greatest anthropogenic threat to mangrove ecosystems. These shrimp ponds reduce estuary circulation and water quality which leads to the promotion of diel-cycling hypoxia. When the quality of the water degrades, the shrimp ponds are quickly abandoned leaving massive amounts of wastewater. This is a major source of water pollution that promotes ocean deoxygenation in the adjacent habitats.

Due to these frequent hypoxic conditions, the water does not provide habitats to fish. When exposed to extreme hypoxia, ecosystem function can completely collapse. Extreme deoxygenation will affect the local fish populations, which are an essential food source. The environmental costs of shrimp farms in the mangrove forests grossly outweigh their economic benefits. Cessation of shrimp production and restoration of these areas and reduce eutrophication and anthropogenic hypoxia.

==Locations==

In the 1970s, marine dead zones were first noted in settled areas where intensive economic use stimulated scientific scrutiny: in the U.S. East Coast&#x27;s Chesapeake Bay, in Scandinavia&#x27;s strait called the Kattegat, which is the mouth of the Baltic Sea and in other important Baltic Sea fishing grounds, in the Black Sea, and in the northern Adriatic.

Other marine dead zones have appeared in coastal waters of South America, China, Japan, and New Zealand. A 2008 study counted 405 dead zones worldwide.

===Baltic Sea===
Researchers from Baltic Nest Institute published in one of PNAS issues reports that the dead zones in the Baltic Sea have grown from approximately 5,000 km2 to more than 60,000 km2 in recent years.

Some of the causes behind the elevated increase of dead zones can be attributed to the use of fertilizers, large animal farms, the burning of fossil fuels, and effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants.

With its massive size, the Baltic Sea is best analyzed in sub-areas rather than as a whole. In a paper published in 2004, researchers specifically divided the Baltic Sea into 9 sub-areas, each having its own specific characteristics. The 9 sub-areas are discerned as follows: Gulf of Bothnia, Archipelago region, Gulf of Finland, Gulf of Riga, Gulf of Gdansk, Swedish East-coast, Central Baltic, Belt Sea region, and Kattegat. Each sub-area has responded differently to nutrient additions and eutrophication; however, there are a few general patterns and measures for the Baltic Sea as a whole. As the researchers Rönnberg and Bonsdorff state,

&quot;Irrespective of the area-specific effects of the increased loads of nutrients to the Baltic Sea, the sources are more or less similar in the whole region. The extent and the severity of the discharges may differ, however. As is seen in e.g. HELCOM (1996) and Rönnberg (2001), the major sources in the input of nutrients are derived from agriculture, industry, municipal sewage and transports. Nitrogen emissions in form of atmospheric depositions are also important, as well as local point sources, such as aquaculture and leakage from forestry.&quot;

In general, each area of the Baltic Sea is experiencing similar anthropogenic effects. As Rönnberg and Bonsdorff state, &quot;Eutrophication is a serious problem in the Baltic Sea area.&quot; However, when it comes to implementation of water revival programs, each area likely will need to be handled on a local level.

=== Virginia ===

==== Chesapeake Bay ====
According to the National Geographic, the Chesapeake Bay was one of the first hypoxic zones to be identified in the 1970s. The Chesapeake Bay experiences seasonal hypoxia due to high nitrogen levels. These nitrogen levels are caused by urbanization, there are multiple factories that pollute the atmosphere with nitrogen, and agriculture, the opposite side of the bay is used for poultry farming, which produces a lot of manure that ends up running off into the Chesapeake Bay.

From 1985 - 2019, there were efforts from the caretakers of Chesapeake Bay to reduce the annual hypoxic volumes. There was significant improvement in 2016-2017 that gave assurance to the caretakers that the efforts were successful, however recent data has shown that further efforts are needed to continuously curb the effects of global warming.

==== Elizabeth River, Virginia ====
The Elizabeth River estuary is used for commercial and military use and is one of the most commonly used ports on the East Coast of the USA. From 2015-2019, 11 different conditions were measured in various areas of the Elizabeth River. Throughout the river, there were consistently high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, along with high levels of other contaminants contributing to the poor quality of life for bottom feeders along the river. The main cause of the pollution to the Elizabeth river has been the military and industrial activities through the 1990s. In 1993, the Elizabeth River Project was started in attempt to do a restoration project on the river. Adopting one of the fish whose species had been largely impacted by the pollution, the Fundulus heteroclitus (Mummichog), the group was able to gain traction and carry out multiple projects and has removed thousands of tons of contaminated sediment. In 2006, Maersk-APM, a major shipping company, wanted to build a new port on the Elizabeth River. As part of the environmental mitigation they worked with the Elizabeth River Project to create the Money Point Project, which was an effort to restore Money Point, which had been deemed biologically depleted due to a black tar like substance called creosote laying at the bottom. Maersk-APM gave $5 million to help get the project up and running. By 2012, they were able to restore over 7 acres of tidal marsh, 3 acres of oyster reef and created a new shoreline. In 2019, the Money Point Project received the &quot;Best Restored Shore&quot; award from the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association.

===Lake Erie===
A seasonal dead zone exists in the central part of Lake Erie from east of Point Pelee to Long Point and stretches to shores in Canada and the United States. Between the months of July and October the dead zone has the ability to grow to the size of 10,000 square kilometers. Lake Erie has an excess of phosphorus due to agricultural runoff that quickens the growth of algae which then contributes to hypoxic conditions. The superabundance of phosphorus in the lake has been linked to nonpoint source pollution such as urban and agricultural runoff as well as point source pollution that includes sewage and wastewater treatment plants. The zone was first noticed in the 1960s amid the peak of eutrophication occurring in the lake. After public concern increased, Canada and the US launched efforts to reduce runoff pollution into the lake in the 1970s as means to reverse the dead zone growth. Scientists in 2018 stated that phosphorus runoff would have to further decrease by 40% to avoid the emergence of the dead zones in the area. The commercial and recreational fishing industry have been significantly impacted by the hypoxic zone. In 2021, the low-oxygenated waters caused a mass-kill event of freshwater drum fish species (also known as &quot;sheepshead fish&quot;). Water from the lake is also used for human drinking. Water from the lake has been said to acquire a pervasive odor and discoloration when the dead zone is active in the late summer months.

===Lower St. Lawrence Estuary===
A dead zone exists in the Lower St. Lawrence River area from east the Saguenay River to east of Baie Comeau, greatest at depths over and noticed since the 1930s. The main concern for Canadian scientists is the impact on fish found in the area.

===Oregon===
There is a hypoxic zone covering the coasts of Oregon and Washington that reached peak size in 2006 at an area of over 1,158 square miles. Strong surface winds between April and September cause frequent upwelling that results in an increase of algae blooms, rendering the hypoxia a seasonal occurrence. The upwelling has contributed to lower temperatures within the zone. The dead zone has resulted in sea organisms such as crabs and fish relocating and an interference of commercial fishing. Organisms that cannot relocate have been found to suffocate, leaving them unable to be used by fishermen. In 2009, one scientist described &quot;thousands and thousands&quot; of suffocated, crabs, worms, and sea stars along the seafloor of the hypoxic zone. In 2021, 1.9 million dollars were put into monitoring and continuing to study the hypoxic conditions in the area that the dead zone occurs in.


===Gulf of Mexico &#x27;dead zone&#x27;===

The area of temporary hypoxic bottom water that occurs most summers off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico is the largest recurring hypoxic zone in the United States. It occurs only during the summer months of the year due to summer warming, regional circulation, wind mixing and high freshwater discharge. The Mississippi River, which is the drainage area for 41% of the continental United States, dumps high-nutrient runoff such as nitrates and phosphorus into the Gulf of Mexico. According to a 2009 fact sheet created by NOAA, &quot;seventy percent of nutrient loads that cause hypoxia are a result of this vast drainage basin&quot;. which includes the heart of U.S. agribusiness, the Midwest. The discharge of treated sewage from urban areas (pop. c 12 million in 2009) combined with agricultural runoff deliver c. 1.7 million tons of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Gulf of Mexico every year. Nitrogen is indeed needed to increase crop yields, but plants are inefficient at taking it up, and often more fertilizers are used than plants actually need. Therefore, only a percentage of applied nitrogen ends up in the crops; and in some areas that number is less than 20%. Even though Iowa occupies less than 5% of the Mississippi River drainage basin, average annual nitrate discharge from surface water in Iowa is about 204,000 to 222,000 metric tonnes, or 25% of all the nitrate which the Mississippi River delivers to the Gulf of Mexico. Export from the Raccoon River Watershed is among the highest in the United States with annual yields at 26.1 kg/ha/year which ranked as the highest loss of nitrate out of 42 Mississippi subwatersheds evaluated for a Gulf of Mexico hypoxia report. In 2012, Iowa introduced the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which &quot;is a science and technology-based framework to assess and reduce nutrients to Iowa waters and the Gulf of Mexico. It is designed to direct efforts to reduce nutrients in surface water from both point and nonpoint sources in a scientific, reasonable and cost effective manner.&quot; The strategy continues to evolve, using voluntary methods to reduce Iowa&#x27;s negative contributions through outreach, research, and implementation of nutrient holding practices. In order to help reduce agricultural runoff into the Mississippi Basin, Minnesota passed &quot;MN&quot; Statute 103F.48 in 2015, also known as the &quot;Buffer Law&quot;, which was designed to implement mandatory riparian buffers between farmland and public waterways across the State of Minnesota. The Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) issued a January 2019 report stating that compliance with the &#x27;Buffer Law&#x27; has reached 99%.

====Size====

The area of hypoxic bottom water that occurs for several weeks each summer in the Gulf of Mexico has been mapped most years from 1985 through 2024. The size varies annually from a record high in 2017 when it encompassed more than 22,730 square kilometers (8,776 square miles) to a record low in 1988 of 39 square kilometers (15 square miles).

The 2015 dead zone measured 16,760 square kilometers (6,474 square miles).
Nancy Rabalais of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium in Cocodrie, Louisiana predicted the dead zone or hypoxic zone in 2012 will cover an area of 17,353 square kilometers (6,700 square miles) which is larger than Connecticut; however, when the measurements were completed, the area of hypoxic bottom water in 2012 only totaled 7,480 square kilometers. The models using the nitrogen flux from the Mississippi River to predict the &quot;dead zone&quot; areas have been criticized for being systematically high from 2006 to 2014, having predicted record areas in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2013 that were never realized.

In late summer 1988 the dead zone disappeared as the great drought caused the flow of Mississippi to fall to its lowest level since 1933. During times of heavy flooding in the Mississippi River Basin, as in 1993, &quot;the &quot;dead zone&quot;
dramatically increased in size, approximately larger than the previous year&quot;.

====Economic impact====

Some assert that the dead zone threatens lucrative commercial and recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. &quot;In 2009, the dockside value of commercial fisheries in the Gulf was $629 million. Nearly three million recreational fishers further contributed about $10 billion to the Gulf economy, taking 22 million fishing trips.&quot; Scientists are not in universal agreement that nutrient loading has a negative impact on fisheries. Grimes makes a case that nutrient loading enhances the fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico. Courtney et al. hypothesize, that nutrient loading may have contributed to the increases in red snapper in the northern and western Gulf of Mexico.

In 2017, Tulane University offered a $1 million challenge grant for growing crops with less fertilizer.

====History====

Shrimp trawlers first reported a &#x27;dead zone&#x27; in the Gulf of Mexico in 1950, but it was not until 1970 when the size of the hypoxic zone had increased that scientists began to investigate.

After 1950, the conversion of forests and wetlands for agricultural and urban developments accelerated. &quot;Missouri River Basin has had hundreds of thousands of acres of forests and wetlands (66,000,000 acres) replaced with agriculture activity [. . .] In the Lower Mississippi one-third of the valley&#x27;s forests were converted to agriculture between 1950 and 1976.&quot;

In July 2007, a dead zone was discovered off the coast of Texas where the Brazos River empties into the Gulf.

=== Korea ===

==== Jinhae Bay ====
Jinhae Bay is the first of Korea&#x27;s two major dead zones. Hypoxia was first reported in Jinhae Bay in September 1974. In 2011, a joint study was done to observe and record causes, effects, and what can be done about Korea&#x27;s hypoxic zones. It was discovered that Jinhae Bay exhibits a seasonal dead zone from early June to late September. This dead zone is caused by &quot;domestic and land use waste and thermal stratification&quot;. Jinhae Bay experiences hypoxia largely at the bottom of its bay. The ratio of phosphorus to nitrogen is imbalanced at the bottom, where it is otherwise balanced at the top, with the exception of early June to late September where the Bay experiences eutrophication as a whole. The effects of Jinhae Bay&#x27;s hypoxia is seen in the marine system surrounding Korea, with a loss of biological diversity, particularly of the calcareous shelled organisms.

==== Shihwa Bay ====
Shihwa Bay is a coastal reservoir created in 1994 to supply surrounding agricultural lands with water, and act as a run-off lake for nearby industrial plants. The Bay was made without much environmental consideration, and by 1999, water quality had a significant drop. This drop in water quality is attributed to the bay not having enough circulation or new water flow to accommodate the domestic and industrial waste being dumped. In response, the Korean government set up a pollution management system within the bay, and has a gate system that allows the Bay to mix with water in the sea. Shihwa Bay is also experiencing an imbalance of phosphorus to nitrogen, but also large sources of ammonium.      

==Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007==
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 calls for the production of of renewable fuels by 2022, including of corn-based ethanol, a tripling of current production that would require a similar increase in corn production. Unfortunately, the plan poses a new problem; the increase in demand for corn production results in a proportional increase in nitrogen runoff. Although nitrogen, which makes up 78% of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, is an inert gas, it has more reactive forms, two of which (nitrate and ammonia) are used to make fertilizer.

According to , a professor of crop physiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, corn requires more nitrogen-based fertilizer because it produces a higher grain per unit area than other crops and, unlike other crops, corn is completely dependent on available nitrogen in soil. The results, reported March 18, 2008, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that scaling up corn production to meet the goal would increase nitrogen loading in the Dead Zone by 10–18%. This would boost nitrogen levels to twice the level recommended by the Mississippi Basin/Gulf of Mexico Water Nutrient Task Force (Mississippi River Watershed Conservation Programs), a coalition of federal, state, and tribal agencies that have monitored the dead zone since 1997. The task force says a 30% reduction of nitrogen runoff is needed if the dead zone is to shrink.

==Reversal==

The recovery of benthic communities primarily depends upon the length and severity of hypoxic conditions inside the zone. Less severe conditions and temporary depletion of oxygen allow rapid recovery of benthic communities in the area due to reestablishment by benthic larvae from adjacent areas, with longer conditions of hypoxia and more severe oxygen depletion leading to longer reestablishment periods. Recovery also depends upon stratification levels within the area, so heavily stratified areas in warmer waters are less likely to recover from anoxic or hypoxic conditions in addition to being more susceptible to eutrophication driven hypoxia. The difference in recovery ability and susceptibility to hypoxia in stratified marine environments is expected to complicate recovery efforts of dead zones in the future as ocean warming continues.

Small scale hypoxic systems with rich surrounding communities are the most likely to recover after nutrient influxes leading to eutrophication stop. However, depending on the extent of damage and characteristics of the zone, large scale hypoxic condition could also potentially recover after a period of a decade. For example, the Black Sea dead zone, previously the largest in the world, largely disappeared between 1991 and 2001 after fertilizers became too costly to use following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the demise of centrally planned economies in Eastern and Central Europe. Fishing has again become a major economic activity in the region.

While the Black Sea &quot;cleanup&quot; was largely unintentional and involved a drop in hard-to-control fertilizer usage, the U.N. has advocated other cleanups by reducing large industrial emissions. From 1985 to 2000, the North Sea dead zone had nitrogen reduced by 37% when policy efforts by countries on the Rhine River reduced sewage and industrial emissions of nitrogen into the water. Other cleanups have taken place along the Hudson River and San Francisco Bay.

<doc id="626086" wikidata="Q299331" url="?curid=626086" title="Mario Lanza">
<text>Mario Lanza ( , ; born Alfredo Arnold Cocozza ; January 31, 1921 – October 7, 1959) was an American tenor and actor. He was a Hollywood film star popular in the late 1940s and the 1950s. Lanza began studying to be a professional singer at the age of 16. After appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1947, Lanza signed a seven-year film contract with Louis B. Mayer, the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who saw his performance and was impressed by his singing. Prior to that, the adult Lanza sang only two performances of an opera. The following year (1948) he sang the role of Pinkerton in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in New Orleans.

His film debut for MGM was in &quot;That Midnight Kiss&quot; (1949) with Kathryn Grayson and Ethel Barrymore. A year later, in &quot;The Toast of New Orleans&quot;, his featured popular song &quot;Be My Love&quot; became his first million-selling hit. In 1951, he starred as tenor Enrico Caruso, his idol, in the biopic &quot;The Great Caruso&quot;, which produced another million-seller with &quot;The Loveliest Night of the Year&quot; (a song which used the melody of &quot;Sobre las Olas&quot;). &quot;The Great Caruso&quot; was the 11th top-grossing film that year.

The title song of his next film, &quot;Because You&#x27;re Mine&quot;, was his final million-selling hit song. The song went on to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song. After recording the soundtrack for his next film, &quot;The Student Prince&quot;, he embarked upon a protracted battle with studio head Dore Schary arising from artistic differences with director Curtis Bernhardt, and was eventually fired by MGM.

Lanza was known to be &quot;rebellious, tough, and ambitious&quot;. During most of his film career, he suffered from addictions to overeating and alcohol which had a serious effect on his health and his relationships with directors, producers and, occasionally, other cast members. Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper writes that &quot;his smile, which was as big as his voice, was matched with the habits of a tiger cub, impossible to housebreak.&quot; She adds that he was the &quot;last of the great romantic performers&quot;. He made three more films before dying of an apparent pulmonary embolism at the age of 38. At the time of his death in 1959, he was still &quot;the most famous tenor in the world&quot;. Author Eleonora Kimmel concludes that Lanza &quot;blazed like a meteor whose light lasts a brief moment in time&quot;.

==Early years==

Born Alfredo Arnold Cocozza in Philadelphia, he was exposed to classical singing at an early age by his Abruzzese-Molisan Italian parents. His mother Maria Lanza was from Tocco da Casauria, a town in the province of Pescara in the region of Abruzzo. His father Antonio Cocozza was from Filignano, a town in the province of Isernia in the region of Molise.

By age 16, his vocal talent had become apparent. Starting out in local operatic productions in Philadelphia for the YMCA Opera Company while still in his teens, he later came to the attention of longtime (1924–49) principal Boston Symphony conductor Serge Koussevitzky. In 1942, Koussevitzky provided young Cocozza with a full student scholarship to the Berkshire Music Center at Tanglewood, Massachusetts. Reportedly, Koussevitzky later told him &quot;Yours is a voice such as is heard once in a hundred years.&quot;

==Opera career==
He made the first of his few appearances in opera as Fenton in Otto Nicolai&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (in English) at the Berkshire Music Festival in Tanglewood on August 7, 1942 after a period of study with conductors Boris Goldovsky and Leonard Bernstein. This was when Cocozza adopted the stage name Mario Lanza for its similarity to his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Maria Lanza.

The performances at Tanglewood won Lanza critical acclaim, with Noel Straus of &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailing the 21-year-old tenor as having &quot;few equals among tenors of the day in terms of quality, warmth and power&quot;. Herbert Graf subsequently wrote in &quot;Opera News&quot; (October 5, 1942), &quot;A real find of the season was Mario Lanza [...] He would have no difficulty one day being asked to join the Metropolitan Opera.&quot; Lanza sang Nicolai&#x27;s Fenton twice at Tanglewood, in addition to appearing there in a one-off presentation of Act III of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot; with the noted Mexican soprano Irma González, baritone James Pease and mezzo-soprano Laura Castellano. Music critic Jay C. Rosenfeld wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of August 9, 1942, &quot;Irma González as Mimì and Mario Lanza as Rodolfo were conspicuous by the beauty of their voices and the vividness of their characterizations.&quot; In an interview shortly before her own death in 2008, González recalled that Lanza was &quot;very correct, likeable, with a powerful and beautiful voice&quot;.
Lanza&#x27;s aspiring operatic career was interrupted in World War II when he was assigned to Special Services in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He appeared in the wartime shows &quot;On the Beam&quot; and &quot;Winged Victory&quot;. He also appeared in the film version of the latter (albeit as an unrecognizable member of the chorus). He resumed his singing career with a concert in Atlantic City, New Jersey with the NBC Symphony Orchestra in September 1945 under Peter Herman Adler, subsequently his mentor. The following month, he replaced tenor Jan Peerce on the live CBS radio program &quot;Great Moments in Music&quot; on which he made six appearances in four months, singing extracts from various operas and other works.

Lanza studied with Enrico Rosati for 15 months, and then embarked on an 86-concert tour of the United States, Canada and Mexico between July 1947 and May 1948 with bass George London and soprano Frances Yeend. Reviewing his second appearance at Chicago&#x27;s Grant Park in July 1947 in the &quot;Chicago Sunday Tribune&quot;, Claudia Cassidy praised Lanza&#x27;s &quot;superbly natural tenor&quot; and observed that &quot;though a multitude of fine points evade him, he possesses the things almost impossible to learn. He knows the accent that makes a lyric line reach its audience, and he knows why opera is music drama.&quot;

In April 1948, Lanza sang two performances as Pinkerton in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; for the New Orleans Opera Association conducted by Walter Herbert with stage director Armando Agnini. Reviewing the opening-night performance in the &quot;St. Louis News&quot; (April 9, 1948), Laurence Oden wrote &quot;Mario Lanza performed ... Lieutenant Pinkerton with considerable verve and dash. Rarely have we seen a more superbly romantic leading tenor. His exceptionally beautiful voice helps immeasurably.&quot; Following the success of these performances, he was invited to return to New Orleans in 1949 as Alfredo in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot;. But, as biographer Armando Cesari wrote, Lanza by 1949 &quot;was already deeply engulfed in the Hollywood machinery and consequently never learned [that key mid-Verdi tenor] role.&quot;

At the time of his death, Lanza was preparing to return to the operatic stage. Conductor Peter Herman Adler, with whom Lanza previously had worked both in concert and on the soundtrack of &quot;The Great Caruso&quot;, visited the tenor in Rome during the summer of 1959 and later recalled that &quot;[Lanza] was working two hours a day with an operatic coach, and intended to go back to opera, his only true love.&quot; Adler promised the tenor &quot;all possible help&quot; in his &quot;planning for his operatic future.&quot; In the October 14, 1959 edition of &quot;Variety&quot;, it was reported that Lanza had planned to make his return to opera in the role of Canio in Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; during the Rome Opera&#x27;s 1960–61 season. This was subsequently confirmed by Riccardo Vitale, artistic director of the Rome Opera. &quot;Variety&quot; also noted that preparations had been underway at the time of Lanza&#x27;s death for him to participate in a series of complete opera recordings for RCA Victor to be recorded in Rome by RCA Italiana.

==Film career==
A concert at the Hollywood Bowl in August 1947 had brought Lanza to the attention of Louis B. Mayer, who promptly signed Lanza to a seven-year film contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The contract required him to commit to the studio for six months of the year and Lanza initially believed he would be able to combine his film career with his operatic and concert appearances. In May 1949, he made his first commercial recordings for RCA Victor. Lanza&#x27;s recording of the aria &quot;Che gelida manina&quot; (from &quot;La bohème&quot;) from that first session was subsequently awarded the prize of Operatic Recording of the Year by the (United States) National Record Critics Association.

===&quot;The Toast of New Orleans&quot;===
Lanza&#x27;s first two starring films, &quot;That Midnight Kiss&quot; and &quot;The Toast of New Orleans&quot;, both opposite top-billed Kathryn Grayson, were commercial successes, and in 1950, his recording of &quot;Be My Love&quot; from the latter became the first of three million-selling singles for the young tenor, earning him enormous fame in the process. While at MGM, Lanza worked closely with Academy Award-winning conductor, composer, and arranger Johnny Green.

In a 1977 interview with Lanza biographer Armando Cesari, Green recalled that the tenor was insecure about the manner in which he had become successful, and was keenly aware of the fact that he had become a Hollywood star before first having established himself on the operatic stage.Had [Lanza] been already a leading tenor, if not &quot;the&quot; leading tenor at the Met[ropolitan Opera House], and come to Hollywood in between seasons to make a picture, he would have had [the security of having] the Met as his home,&quot; Green remarked. According to Green, Lanza possessed &quot;the voice of the next Caruso. [Lanza] had an unusual, very unusual quality ... a tenor with a baritone color in the middle and lower registers, and a great feeling for the making of music. A great musicality. I found it fascinating, musically, to work with [him].

===&quot;The Great Caruso&quot;===
Lanza portrayed Enrico Caruso in &quot;The Great Caruso&quot; (1951), which was MGM&#x27;s biggest success of the year. At this time, the tenor&#x27;s increasing popularity exposed him to intense criticism by some music critics, including those who had praised his work just a few years earlier. His portrayal of Caruso earned him compliments from the subject&#x27;s son, Enrico Caruso Jr., a tenor in his own right. Shortly before his own death in 1987, Enrico Jr. wrote in &quot;Enrico Caruso: My Father and My Family&quot; (posthumously published in 1990) that:I can think of no other tenor, before or since Mario Lanza, who could have risen with comparable success to the challenge of playing Caruso in a screen biography ... Lanza was born with one of the dozen or so great tenor voices of the century, with a natural voice placement, an unmistakable and very pleasing timbre, and a nearly infallible musical instinct.

===&quot;The Student Prince&quot;===

Lanza&#x27;s next film for MGM, &quot;Because You&#x27;re Mine&quot; (1952) was another financial, if not critical success; Lanza felt the script was inferior to &quot;The Great Caruso&quot; and he didn&#x27;t want to make the film. Lanza&#x27;s reputation for being temperamental and difficult began during this production. Later in 1952, Lanza was suspended and ultimately dismissed by MGM after he had recorded the songs for his next film, &quot;The Student Prince&quot; (1954). The reason most frequently cited in the tabloid press at the time was that his recurring weight problem had made it impossible for him to fit into the costumes of the Prince. However, as his biographers Cesari and Mannering have established, Lanza was not overweight at the beginning of the production, and it was, in fact, a disagreement with director Curtis Bernhardt over Lanza&#x27;s performance of one of the songs in the film that led to Lanza walking off the set. MGM refused to replace Bernhardt, and the film was subsequently made starring English actor Edmund Purdom, who lip-synched to Lanza&#x27;s dubbed singing voice.

Depressed by his dismissal by MGM and with his self-confidence severely undermined, Lanza became a virtual recluse for more than a year, frequently seeking refuge in alcoholic and eating binges. During this period, Lanza also came very close to bankruptcy as a result of poor investment decisions by his former manager and his lavish spending habits left him owing about $250,000 in back taxes to the IRS.

===&quot;Serenade&quot;===
Lanza returned to an active film career in &quot;Serenade&quot; (1956), released by Warner Bros. However the film was not as successful as his earlier films, despite strong musical content, including arias from &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, &quot;Fedora&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;arlesiana&quot;, and &quot;Otello&quot;, as well as the Act I duet from &quot;Otello&quot; with soprano Licia Albanese. In 1980, Mme. Albanese said of Lanza:I had heard all sorts of stories about Mario. That his voice was too small for the stage, that he couldn&#x27;t learn a score, that he couldn&#x27;t sustain a full opera; in fact, that he couldn&#x27;t even sing a full aria, that his recordings were made by splicing together various portions of an aria. None of it is true! He had the most beautiful lirico spinto voice. It was a gorgeous, beautiful, powerful voice. I should know because I sang with so many tenors. He had everything that one needs. The voice, the temperament, perfect diction. ... Vocally he was very secure. All he needed was coaching. Everything was so easy for him. He was fantastic! 
In May 1957, Lanza moved to Rome, Italy where he starred in the film &quot;Seven Hills of Rome&quot; (1958), and returned to performing live in November of that year, appearing before Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Variety Show at the London Palladium. From January to April 1958, Lanza gave a concert tour of the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and Germany. He gave a total of 22 concerts on this tour, receiving mostly positive reviews for his singing. Despite a number of cancellations, which resulted from his poor health during this period, Lanza continued to receive offers for operatic appearances, concerts, and films.

In September 1958, he made a number of operatic recordings at the Rome Opera House for the soundtrack of what would turn out to be his final film, &quot;For the First Time&quot; (1959). It was then that he came to the attention of that opera house&#x27;s artistic director, Riccardo Vitale, who promptly offered the tenor &quot;carte blanche&quot; in his choice of operatic roles. Lanza also received offers to sing in any opera of his choosing from the San Carlo in Naples. At the same time, however, his health continued to decline, with the tenor suffering from a variety of ailments, including phlebitis and acute high blood pressure. His old habits of overeating and crash dieting, coupled with binge drinking, compounded his problems.

==Personal life==
Lanza&#x27;s friend Bert Hicks introduced him to his sister, Betty Hicks. Lanza and Betty began dating, and the couple were married by a judge at the Beverly Hills city hall on April 13, 1945. Later that year, on July 15, they had a religious ceremony at a Catholic church. They had four children: Coleen (born December 9, 1948), Ellisa (born December 3, 1950), Damon (born December 12, 1952), and Marc (born May 19, 1954).

Lanza died on October 7, 1959, and his wife died on March 11, 1960. The coroner&#x27;s report stated Betty Lanza had a high level of alcohol and Seconal in her system.
After the death of both parents Mario Lanza&#x27;s mother, Maria Lanza Cocozza, became the orphaned children&#x27;s guardian.

==Death==
In April 1959, Lanza reportedly fell ill, mainly with heart problems as well as pneumonia. On September 25, 1959, he entered Rome&#x27;s Valle Giulia clinic for the purpose of losing weight for an upcoming film. While in the clinic, he underwent a controversial weight loss program colloquially known as &quot;the twilight sleep treatment&quot;, which required its patients to be kept immobile and sedated for prolonged periods. On October 7, Lanza died of an apparent pulmonary embolism at age 38. No autopsy was performed. Maria Caniglia, Franco Fabrizi, and Enzo Fiermonte attended the funeral. Frank Sinatra sent his condolences by telegram.

==Legacy==
===Musical legacy===
Lanza was the first RCA Victor Red Seal artist to win a gold disc and the first artist to sell two and a half million albums. He was referred to by some sources as the &quot;new Caruso&quot; after his &quot;instant success&quot; in Hollywood films, while MGM hoped he would become the movie studio&#x27;s &quot;singing Clark Gable&quot; for his good looks and powerful voice. He was a big inspiration to fellow RCA Victor recording star Elvis Presley. A year after Lanza&#x27;s death, Presley recorded an English translation of &quot;O Sole Mio&quot;, which was popularized by Lanza. This song, &quot;It&#x27;s Now or Never&quot;, went on to be one of Presley&#x27;s all-time best selling songs.

In 1994, José Carreras paid tribute to Lanza during a worldwide concert tour, saying, &quot;If I&#x27;m an opera singer, it&#x27;s thanks to Mario Lanza.&quot; Plácido Domingo stated, &quot;Lanza&#x27;s passion and the way his voice sounds are what made me sing opera. I actually owe my love for opera...to a kid from Philadelphia.&quot;

Because Lanza appeared on the operatic stage only twice, many critics felt that he needed to have had more experience in major theaters before he could have been considered an opera star. His films, especially &quot;The Great Caruso&quot;, influenced several future opera stars, including Joseph Calleja, José Carreras, Plácido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, and Vyacheslav Polozov. According to opera historian Clyde McCants, &quot;Of all the Hollywood singers who performed operatic music...the one who made the greatest impact was Mario Lanza.&quot; Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper concluded that &quot;there had never been anyone like Mario, and I doubt whether we shall ever see his like again&quot;.

===Portrayal on screen and stage===
A 90-minute PBS documentary, &quot;Mario Lanza: The American Caruso&quot;, hosted by Plácido Domingo and featuring Lanza&#x27;s family and professional associates, was released in 1983, and nominated for a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Informational Series or Special that same year. In October 2007, Charles Messina directed the musical &quot;Be My Love: The Mario Lanza Story&quot;, written by Richard Vetere and produced by Sonny Grosso and Phil Ramone, about Lanza&#x27;s life. It premiered at The Tilles Center for the Performing Arts in Greenvale, New York.

<text>Scott Van Pelt (born ) is an American sportscaster and sports talk show host employed by ESPN. He is a long time anchor of key editions of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; on ESPN, served as the co-host of &quot;SVP &amp; Russillo&quot; alongside Ryen Russillo on ESPN Radio, and hosts various major golf events for the network. For the 2023–24 NFL season, Van Pelt took over as host of &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Van Pelt was born in Brookeville, Maryland, and grew up in the Washington, D.C., area. He attended Flower Valley Elementary School in Rockville, Maryland. He graduated from Sherwood High School in Sandy Spring, Maryland, and from the University of Maryland in 1988 where he studied radio/television and film. He is a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity.

==Career==

Van Pelt began his career in sportscasting in 1990 at WTTG-TV, a FOX affiliate in Washington, D.C. From 1995 to 2000, Van Pelt worked for the Golf Channel, where he was a studio host for some of the network&#x27;s signature programs. He left the channel in 2001 to join ESPN, where he serves as a &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor, and is one of the network&#x27;s top golf correspondents, covering major tournaments such as the Masters Tournament. After acquiring the cable rights to the tournament, Van Pelt also appeared on ESPN&#x27;s coverage of The Open Championship. He also is a prominent personality for ESPN Radio, where he was the co-host of &quot;Tirico and Van Pelt&quot; alongside Mike Tirico before the program was canceled and replaced with Van Pelt&#x27;s own three-hour program, &quot;The Scott Van Pelt Show&quot;, in 2009. The show was renamed &quot;SVP &amp; Russillo&quot; in October 2012 with Van Pelt working alongside Ryen Russillo. He is a studio presenter for the ESPN Network&#x27;s Friday night College Football on ESPN.

Van Pelt has also appeared as a commentator in golf video games, alongside Kelly Tilghman on EA Sports&#x27; &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10&quot; and &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11&quot; and in a comedic turn in &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am&quot;.

In 2012, Van Pelt made the decision to stay with ESPN. In May 2015, the network announced Van Pelt would leave the radio show SVP &amp; Russillo to become a solo anchor for a midnight edition of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, which began in late summer 2015. The midnight show covers sports events from the day, but includes additional commentary from Van Pelt and some popular elements from the radio show.

==Personal life==
Van Pelt&#x27;s grandfather, Lorenzo, immigrated to the U.S. from Italy and lived in Brooklyn. Van Pelt is married to his wife Stephanie, and they have 3 children.

<doc id="626115" wikidata="Q7315799" url="?curid=626115" title="Resource Conservation and Recovery Act">
<text>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted in 1976, is the primary federal law in the United States governing the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste.

==History and goals==
Congress enacted RCRA to address the increasing problems the nation faced from its growing volume of municipal and industrial waste. RCRA was an amendment of the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965. The act set national goals for:
* Protecting human health and the natural environment from the potential hazards of waste disposal.
* Energy conservation and natural resources.
* Reducing the amount of waste generated, through source reduction and recycling
* Maintaining environmental health standards.
* Ensuring the management of waste in an environmentally sound manner.

The RCRA program is a joint federal and state endeavor, with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) providing basic requirements that states then adopt, adapt, and enforce. RCRA is now most widely known for the regulations promulgated under it that set standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste in the United States. However, it also plays an integral role in the management of municipal and industrial waste as well as underground storage tanks.

==Implementation==
EPA has published waste management regulations, which are codified in Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations at parts 239 through 282. Regulations regarding management of hazardous waste begin in part 260. States are authorized to operate their own hazardous waste programs, which must be at least as stringent as federal standards, and are tasked with creating state implementation plans for managing solid waste.

In California, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) is the primary authority enforcing the RCRA requirements, as well as the California Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL) of 1972.

==Provisions==
===Subtitle A: General Provisions===
* Congressional Findings; Objectives and National Policy
* Definitions
* Interstate Cooperation; Application of Act and Integration with Other Acts
* Financial Disclosure; Solid Waste Management Information and Guidelines

===Subtitle B: Office of Solid Waste; Authorities of the Administrator===
* Office of Solid Waste and Interagency Coordinating Committee
* Authorities of EPA Administrator
* Resource Recovery and Conservation Panels; Grants
* Annual Report; Office of Ombudsman
===Subtitle C: &quot;Cradle to Grave&quot; requirements for hazardous waste===
Arguably the most notable provisions of the RCRA statute are included in Subtitle C, which directs EPA to establish controls on the management of hazardous wastes from their point of generation, through their transportation and treatment, storage and/or disposal. Because RCRA requires controls on hazardous waste generators (i.e., sites that generate hazardous waste), transporters, and treatment, storage and disposal facilities (i.e., facilities that ultimately treat/dispose of or recycle the hazardous waste), the overall regulatory framework has become known as the &quot;cradle to grave&quot; system. States are authorized to implement their own hazardous waste programs. The statute imposes stringent recordkeeping and reporting requirements on generators, transporters, and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities handling hazardous waste.

===Subtitle D: Non-hazardous Solid Wastes===
Subtitle D provides criteria for landfills and other waste disposal facilities, and banned open landfills. EPA published its initial standards in 1979 for &quot;sanitary&quot; landfills that receive municipal solid waste. The &quot;solid waste&quot; definition includes garbage (e.g., food containers, coffee grounds), non-recycled household appliances, residue from incinerated automobile tires, refuse such as metal scrap, construction materials, and sludge from industrial and sewage treatment plants and drinking water treatment plants. Subtitle D also exempted certain hazardous wastes from the Subtitle C regulations, such as hazardous wastes from households and from conditionally exempt small quantity generators.

====Special wastes====
In 1980 Congress designated several kinds of industrial wastes as &quot;special wastes,&quot; which are exempt from Subtitle C, including oil and gas exploration and production wastes (such as drill cuttings, produced water, and drilling fluids), coal combustion residuals generated by electric power plants and other industries, mining waste, and cement kiln dust. &quot;See&quot; Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980.

===Subtitle E: Department of Commerce responsibilities===
* Development of Specifications for secondary materials; Development of markets for recovered material.
* Technology promotion

===Subtitle F: Federal responsibilities===
* Application of Federal, State and Local Law to Federal Facilities
* Federal procurement
* Cooperation with EPA; Applicability of solid waste disposal guidelines to executive agencies

===Subtitle G: Miscellaneous provisions===
* Whistleblower protection. Employees in the United States who believe they were fired or suffered another adverse action related to enforcement of this law have 30 days to file a written complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
* Citizen Suits; Imminent Hazard suits
* Petition for regulations; Public participation

===Subtitle H: Research, Development, Demonstration and Information===
* Research, Demonstrations, Training; Special Studies
* Coordination, collection, dissemination of information

===Subtitle I: Underground Storage Tanks===
;Background
The operation of underground storage tanks (USTs) became subject to the RCRA regulatory program with enactment of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA). At that time there were about 2.1 million tanks subject to federal regulation, and the EPA program led to closure and removal of most substandard tanks. As of 2009 there were approximately 600,000 active USTs at 223,000 sites subject to federal regulation.

;Regulatory requirements
The federal UST regulations cover tanks storing petroleum or listed hazardous substances, and define the types of tanks permitted. EPA established a tank notification system to track UST status. UST regulatory programs are principally administered by state and U.S. territorial agencies.

The regulations set standards for:
* Groundwater monitoring
* Secondary Containment
* Release detection, prevention and correction
* Spill prevention
* Overfill prevention (for petroleum products)
* Restrictions on land disposal of untreatable hazardous waste products.

The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) required owners and operators of USTs to ensure corrective action is completed when a tank is in need of repair, or removal, when it is necessary to protect human health and the environment. The amendments established a trust fund to pay for the cleanup of leaking UST sites where responsible parties cannot be identified.

It is also recommended that above-ground storage tanks are used whenever possible.

===Subtitle J: Medical Waste (expired)===
RCRA Subtitle J regulated medical waste in four states (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Rhode Island) and Puerto Rico, and expired on March 22, 1991. (&quot;See&quot; Medical Waste Tracking Act.) State environmental and health agencies regulate medical waste, rather than EPA. Other federal agencies have issued safety regulations governing the handling of medical waste, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration.

==Amendments and related legislation==
===Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980===
Congress exempted several types of wastes from classification as hazardous under Subtitle C in its 1980 amendment to RCRA. The &quot;Solid Waste Disposal Amendments of 1980&quot; designated the following categories as &quot;special wastes&quot; and not subject to the stricter permitting requirements of Subtitle C:
* coal combustion residuals (CCR) generated by electric power plants and other industries, including fly ash, bottom ash, slag waste and flue-gas desulfurization wastes
* mining waste from ore mines and mineral mines
* cement kiln dust
* drilling fluid, produced water, and other wastes from oil and gas wells.
These legislative exemptions, known as the &quot;Bevill exclusion&quot; and the &quot;Bentsen exclusion&quot;, were intended to be temporary, pending studies conducted by EPA and subsequent determinations as to whether any of these waste categories should be classified as hazardous. In its reviews following the 1980 amendments, EPA determined that most of the exempted waste types would continue to be classified as non-hazardous.

====Regulations====

EPA published a CCR regulation in 2015 that would restrict the continued use of unlined ash ponds (surface impoundments) by coal-fired power plants. This regulation, was which was modified by the Trump administration in 2018, has been challenged in litigation and remanded to EPA for further revision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In response to the court decision, EPA published a proposed rule on December 2, 2019 that would establish an August 31, 2020 deadline for facilities to stop placing ash in unlined impoundments. The proposal would also provide additional time for some facilities—up to eight years—to find alternatives for managing ash wastes before closing surface impoundments.

===Superfund===
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), also known as &quot;Superfund,&quot; was enacted in 1980 to address the problem of remediating abandoned hazardous waste sites, by establishing legal liability, as well as a trust fund for cleanup activities. In general CERCLA applies to contaminated sites, while RCRA&#x27;s focus is on controlling the ongoing generation and management of particular waste streams. RCRA, like CERCLA, has provisions to require cleanup of contaminated sites that occurred in the past.

===Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984===
In 1984 Congress expanded the scope of RCRA with the enactment of Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA). The amendments strengthened the law by covering small quantity generators of hazardous waste and establishing requirements for hazardous waste incinerators, and the closing of substandard landfills.

===Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996===
The &quot;Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act of 1996&quot; allowed some flexibility in the procedures for land disposal of certain wastes. For example, a waste is not subject to land disposal restrictions if it is sent to an industrial wastewater treatment facility, a municipal sewage treatment plant, or is treated in a &quot;zero discharge&quot; facility.

==Treatment, storage, and disposal facility permits==

Treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs) manage hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle C and generally must have a permit in order to operate. While most facilities have RCRA permits, some continue to operate under what is called &quot;interim status.&quot; Interim status requirements appear in 40 CFR Part 265.

The permitting requirements for TSDFs appear in 40 CFR Parts 264 and 270. TSDFs manage (treat, store, or dispose) hazardous waste in units that may include: container storage areas, tanks, surface impoundments, waste piles, land treatment units, landfills, incinerators, containment buildings, and/or drip pads. The unit-specific permitting and operational requirements are described in further detail in 40 CFR Part 264, Subparts J through DD.
==Case law==

&quot;City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey&quot;, 437 U.S. 617 (1978). The United States Supreme Court held that states could not discriminate against another state&#x27;s articles of commerce. A New Jersey statute that prohibited the importation of waste that originated or was collected outside New Jersey was held to violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.

&quot;Hallstrom v. Tillamook County&quot;, 493 U.S. 20 (1990). The Supreme Court held that a citizen suit under the RCRA must be dismissed if the plaintiff fails to meet the statute&#x27;s notice and 60-day delay requirements.

&quot;Department of Energy v. Ohio&quot;, 503 U.S. 607 (1992). The Supreme Court held that Congress did not waive the federal government&#x27;s sovereign immunity from liability for civil fines imposed by a state for past violations of the Clean Water Act (CWA) or RCRA.

&quot;Meghrig v. KFC Western, Inc.&quot;, 516 U.S. 479 (1996). The Supreme Court held that the RCRA does not authorize a citizen suit to recover past cleanup costs when the toxic waste does not, at the time of suit, continue to pose an endangerment to health or the environment.

&quot;Southern Union Co. v. United States&quot;, 567 U.S. 343 (2012). The Supreme Court held that any fact, other than a prior conviction, that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and determined beyond a reasonable doubt.

<text>An interest-only loan is a loan in which the borrower pays only the interest for some or all of the term, with the principal balance unchanged during the interest-only period. At the end of the interest-only term the borrower must renegotiate another interest-only mortgage, pay the principal, or, if previously agreed, convert the loan to a principal-and-interest payment (amortizing) loan at the borrower&#x27;s option.

==By country==

===United States===
In the United States, a five- or ten-year interest-only period is typical. After this time, the principal balance is amortized for the remaining term. In other words, if a borrower had a thirty-year mortgage loan and the first ten years were interest only, at the end of the first ten years, the principal balance would be amortized for the remaining period of twenty years. The practical result is that the early payments (in the interest-only period) are substantially lower than the later payments. This gives the borrower more flexibility because the borrower is not forced to make payments towards principal. Indeed, it also enables a borrower who expects to increase his salary substantially over the course of the loan to borrow more than the borrower would have otherwise been able to afford, or investors to generate cashflow when they might not otherwise be able to. During the interest-only years of the mortgage, the loan balance will not decrease unless the borrower makes additional payments towards principal. Under a conventional amortizing mortgage, the portion of a payment that applies to principal is significantly smaller than the portion that applies to interest in the early years (the same period of time that would be interest-only).

Interest-only loans represent a somewhat higher risk for lenders, and therefore are subject to a slightly higher interest rate. Combined with little or no down payment, the adjustable rate (ARM) variety of interest-only mortgages are sometimes indicative of a buyer taking on too much risk—especially when that buyer is unlikely to qualify under more conservative loan structures. Because a homeowner does not build any equity in an interest-only loan he may be adversely affected by prevailing market conditions at the time the borrower is ready to either sell the house or refinance. The borrower may find themselves unable to afford the higher regularly amortized payments at the end of the interest-only period, unable to refinance due to lack of equity, and unable to sell if demand for housing has weakened.

Due to the speculative aspects of relying on home appreciation which may or may not happen, many financial experts such as Suze Orman advise against interest-only loans for which a borrower would not otherwise qualify. The types of interest-only loans that rely on home appreciation would be negative amortization loans, which most financial institutions discontinued in mid-2008.

A study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago before the 2008 financial crash claimed that most Americans could benefit from funding tax-deferred accounts rather than paying down mortgage balances. Homeowners sometimes use interest-only loans to free up monthly cash to fund retirement accounts. 3.4 million households don&#x27;t contribute at all to their retirement but do accelerate the paying down of their mortgages. &quot;Those households are losing from 11 to 17 cents for each dollar they put into a faster mortgage payoff&quot;, per a Chicago Federal Reserve study reiterated in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
Interest-only loans are popular ways of borrowing money to buy an asset that is unlikely to depreciate much and which can be sold at the end of the loan to repay the capital. For example, second homes, or properties bought for letting to others. In the United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s a popular way to buy a house was to combine an interest-only loan with an endowment policy, the combination being known as an endowment mortgage. Homeowners were told that the endowment policy would cover the mortgage and provide a lump sum in addition. Many of these endowment policies were poorly managed and failed to deliver the promised amounts, some of which did not even cover the cost of the mortgage. This mis-selling, combined with the poor stock market performance of the late 1990s, has resulted in endowment mortgages becoming unpopular. 

===India===
After the entry of private banks into the Indian banking sector, which was earlier dominated by nationalized banks, interest-only loans have been introduced. These loans are given provided that the borrower hands over a security (like gold ornaments) or the documents of the same (house papers) to the bank. Gold loans are the most common interest-only loans in India.

===Singapore===
In Singapore, interest-only mortgages had been disallowed since 14 September 2009. The reason for this was that this type of mortgage encouraged property speculations. Buyers will buy a private house while it is still under construction, and pay only the interest of the mortgage until the property is completed. Due to the lower monthly repayment (interest only) during the construction phase, some investors, thus, will acquire the house with the intention of selling it at a profit before the construction is completed.

==Economic effects==
Interest-only securities are sometimes generated artificially from structured securities, particularly CMOs. A pool of securities (typically mortgages) is created, and divided into tranches; the cash received from the underlying debts are spread through the tranches according to predefined rules. An Interest-only (IO) security is one type of tranche that can be created, it is generally created in tandem with a principal-only (PO) tranche. These tranches will cater to two particular types of investors, depending on whether the investors are trying to increase their current yield (which they can get from an IO), or trying to reduce their exposure to prepayments of the loans (which they can get from a PO). The investment returns on IOs and POs depend heavily on mortgage prepayment rates and permit investors to benefit from different prepayment expectations.

Many U.S. markets saw home values increase by as much as four times in a five-year span in the early 2000s. Interest-only loans helped homeowners afford more home and earn more appreciation during this time period. However, interest-only loans contributed greatly to creating the subsequent housing bubble situation, because variable-rate borrowers could not afford the fully indexed rate. Interest-only loans are disadvantaged for borrowers when housing prices drop, making the mortgage larger than the value of the house.

<text>A single-coil pickup is a type of magnetic transducer, or pickup, for the electric guitar and the electric bass. It electromagnetically converts the vibration of the strings to an electric signal. Single-coil pickups are one of the two most popular designs, along with dual-coil or &quot;humbucking&quot; pickups.

== History ==

=== Beauchamp ===
In the mid-1920s George Beauchamp, a Los Angeles, California, guitarist, began experimentation with electric amplification of the guitar. Originally using a phonograph pickup assembly, Beauchamp began testing many different combinations of coils and magnets trying to create the first electromagnetic guitar pickup. His earliest coils were wound using a motor from a washing machine. Later he switched to a sewing machine motor, and eventually used single-coiled magnets.

Beauchamp was backed in his efforts by Adolph Rickenbacker, an engineer and wealthy owner of a successful tool and die business. Beauchamp eventually produced the first successful single-coil pickup, which consisted of two massive U-shaped magnets and one coil and was known as the &quot;horseshoe pickup&quot;. The two horseshoe-shaped magnets surrounded the strings that passed over a single core plate (or blade) in the center of the coil.

=== Gibson ===

The Gibson Guitar Corporation introduced the &quot;bar pickup&quot; in 1935 for its new line of Hawaiian lap steel guitars. The pickup&#x27;s basic construction is that of a metal blade inserted through the coil as a shared pole piece for all the strings. A pair of large flat magnets were fastened below the coil assembly.

In 1936 Gibson introduced the ES-150, its first electric Spanish-styled guitar. The ES-150 was outfitted with the bar pickup. Jazz guitar innovator Charlie Christian began playing an ES-150 in the late 1930s with the Benny Goodman Orchestra. This caused the popularity of the electrified guitar to soar. Due to Christian&#x27;s close association with the ES-150, it began being referred to as the &quot;Charlie Christian Model&quot; and Gibson&#x27;s now famous bar pickup as the &quot;Charlie Christian pickup&quot; or &quot;CC unit&quot;.

== Common designs ==

=== Gibson P-90 ===
The P-90 is a single coil pickup designed by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. These pickups have a large, flat coil with adjustable steel screws as pole pieces, and a pair of flat alnico bar magnets lying under the coil bobbin. The adjustable pole pieces pick up the magnetism from the magnets. Moving the screw closer or further away from the magnet determines signal strength, thus tone as well. There are two variations of P-90 pickup that differ mainly by mounting options:

* Soap bar casing has true rectangular shape and the mounting screws are contained within the coil perimeter, positioned between the pole pieces, between strings 2-3 and 4-5, thus creating irregular and somewhat unusual pattern. Occasionally, they are mistaken for pole pieces; thus, the P-90 is sometimes erroneously said to have eight pole pieces. The &quot;soap bar&quot; nickname most probably comes from its predominantly rectangular shape and proportions resembling a bar of soap, and the fact that the first P-90s on the original Gibson Les Paul Model of 1952 were white.
* Dog ear is a casing type with extensions at both sides of pickup that somewhat resemble dog&#x27;s ears. These are extensions of the predominantly rectangular cover that encompass the outlying mounting screws. Dog-ear P-90 pickups were commonly mounted on Gibson&#x27;s hollowbody guitars like the ES-330 and occasionally on solid body models like the Les Paul Junior. The same pickups were also available on Epiphone models (since Gibson was building Epiphone guitars in the 1950s) and the design is best remembered for its appearance on the hollow body Epiphone Casino of the mid to late 1960s.

=== Telecaster design ===

The Fender Telecaster features two different single coils. The neck pickup features a metal cover and produces a mellower sound, while the bridge pickup has exposed pole pieces and produces an extremely twangy, sharp tone with exaggerated treble response, because the bridge pickup is mounted on a steel plate. These design elements allow musicians to emulate steel guitar sounds, making it particularly appropriate for country music.

Pickups are selected with a three-position switch, and two wiring schemes exist:

* Vintage: 1) neck pickup with treble cutoff for a bassier sound; 2) neck pickup only; 3) bridge pickup only.
* Modern: 1) neck pickup only, with no treble cutoff; 2) neck and bridge; 3) bridge pickup only.

The Fender Esquire has a variation to the Vintage wiring scheme by using the scheme on a single pickup. This gives a treble cutoff in the first position, normal in the middle position, and a tone control cutoff in the third position.

===Stratocaster design===

The traditional Stratocaster design guitar features three single coils. The guitarist can control which pickup or combination of pickups are selected with a lever switch. The pickup positions are usually referred to as the bridge, middle and neck pickups based on their proximity to those parts of the instrument. The neck pickup typically has the highest output, with the most mid-range and bass response, whereas the bridge pickup has the lowest output (because the strings at the bridge move less) and the greatest treble response, with a slight twang to it. The sound of the middle pickup is similar to that of the neck pickup, albeit with slightly less bass and more treble. However many players, such as Ritchie Blackmore, find it somewhat of an obstruction to the picking hand and loosen the mounting screws such that it lies flush with the pickguard.

Modern Stratocasters have five-position pickup selector switch. Positions 1, 3 and 5 activate only one pickup (bridge, middle or neck respectively), while positions 2 and 4 activate a combination of two pickups (bridge and middle, or middle and neck, respectively). Some pickup sets have a reverse wound and reverse polarity middle pickup that when in combination with the normal bridge or neck pickups will cancel electromagnetic interference (noise/hum) which single coil pickups suffer badly from. The sonic effect of positions 2 and 4 is sometimes referred to as a &quot;quack&quot; or &quot;notch positions&quot;, and some guitar notation includes directions to use these pickup combinations. One example is &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot; by Dire Straits which is played in position 2 (bridge and middle).

== Noise problems ==
A number of types of noise afflict magnetic guitar pickups. &quot;Hum&quot; is caused by magnetic fields due to power frequency currents in electrical equipment, whereas &quot;buzz&quot; is propagated as radio transmissions and sounds more like static. The sources of buzz are many, but an example is an AC power tool with a brush motor. The brush makes and breaks electrical contact with the commutator segment several thousand times a second at variable frequency dependent on load thus causing radio frequency noise. 
Other examples may include playing near older fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts, or high frequency switching DC power supplied from mains power &quot;wall wart&quot; units commonly provided with consumer electronics, computers and smartphones.

Fender-Lace Sensors are a true single coil designed to magnetically shield from hum rather than utilizing the phase cancelling effect common in later double coil/humbucker designs.

Early pickup designs did not include a manufacturing step known as &quot;potting&quot;, wherein at various stages, the bobbin and wrapped coil are immersed in a substance in order to lock the windings in place and prevent microphonic effects of loose strands of wire within resulting in feedback at higher gain settings. Common potting substances include heated beeswax and paraffin, or a combination of the two, and thinned enamel paint, used by some to shield the metallic slugs before beginning the winding process.

The practice of not &quot;potting&quot; pickups persists today in both vintage reproductions as well as more value oriented manufacturers, who may skip the potting step in order to reduce manufacturing costs or provide period accurate reproductions.

== Single-coil form factor &quot;humbuckers&quot; ==
The search for an acceptable solution to mains hum gained new impetus around 1995 as guitar players became increasingly intolerant of the low-noise environment required for single-coil use.

See Humbucker, section Single Coil Form Factor Humbuckers

== Notable single coil pickups ==
There are several well-known single coil pickups that have a distinctive sound:

* Rickenbacker pickups (including the original 1930s &quot;horseshoe&quot; pickup as used in lap steel and solid-body upright basses, and later 6 string electric guitars, pedal steels, and electric bass guitars; also the &quot;Toaster&quot; and &quot;Hi-Gain&quot;)
* Gibson bar pickup (1935) — later called the Charlie Christian pickup (1938)
* Gibson P-90 (1946)
* Fender Telecaster, Stratocaster, Jazzmaster, Jaguar, and other pickups
* Danelectro Lipstick
* Gretsch pickups (including the &quot;HiLoTron&quot;)
* DeArmond pickups (found on various &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s guitars by various manufacturers including Gretsch, Guild, Epiphone, Martin, Kustom, Harmony, Regal, Premier, Silvertone, and others; the trade name is now owned by Fender; single coil models including the 200 aka Dynasonic, 2K, and 2000, &quot;mustache&quot;, various &quot;gold foil&quot; types, and many clip on, rail, or screw mount pickups designed for acoustic guitars and other instruments). The Fender &quot;Tele-Sonic&quot; featured large DeArmond single coils.
* Valco single coil pickups by Ralph Keller (1954) can be found in Airline, Supro, National, English Electronics, Custom Kraft, and a few Gretsch models of guitar from the &#x27;50s, &#x27;60s, and &#x27;70s. The majority of these pickups maintain the physical appearance of a larger, double coil humbucker pickup. Although consisting of a single coil, the pickup contains a second, off-set magnet which cancels hum. Early variations on the Valco-made over-strings &quot;horseshoe&quot; pickup can be found on a number of similarly branded lap steel guitars, such as Oahu.
* Epiphone &quot;New York&quot; pickups
* Lace Sensor pickups (1987)

<text>Charles Wilson Tuckey (born 10 July 1935) is an Australian politician who was a member of the House of Representatives from 1980 to 2010, representing the seat of O&#x27;Connor in Western Australia for the Liberal Party. He was a minister in the Howard government.

==Early life==
Tuckey was born in Perth. Before entering the Federal Parliament, he was a businessman and hotelier.

From 23 May 1964 until 1 March 1965, Tuckey was the last mayor of the town of Carnarvon; after that date the Town was amalgamated into the Shire of Carnarvon. Tuckey went on to serve as the first Shire president from 22 May 1965 until June 1971. Thereafter he was a councillor for the Shire&#x27;s Commercial Ward until 1979.

In 1967, while employed as a publican in Carnarvon, Tuckey was convicted of assault after striking an Aboriginal man with a length of steel cable and fined $50. The man was allegedly being held down by Tuckey&#x27;s brother at the time. Tuckey has had the nickname &quot;Ironbar&quot; ever since.

==Political career==
In 1979, Tuckey was endorsed by the Liberal Party, ahead of the 1980 election, as its candidate for the then-new seat of O&#x27;Connor, covering a large section of rural Western Australia. The demographics of the seat suggested that it should have been a National Country seat, even though it was notionally a comfortably safe Liberal seat. Nevertheless, in 1980 a split between the federal and state branches of the National Country Party allowed Tuckey to win on Labor preferences.

Tuckey was one of the most controversial figures in Australian federal politics. In 1985 he taunted the then Labor Treasurer, Paul Keating, in Parliament about a former girlfriend called &quot;Christine&quot;, leading Keating to call him &quot;a piece of criminal garbage&quot;. In one notorious exchange, Tuckey told Keating: &quot;You are an idiot, you are a hopeless &quot;, to which Keating replied: &quot;Shut up! Sit down and shut up, you pig … Why do you not shut up, you clown? … This man has a criminal intellect … this clown continues to interject in perpetuity&quot;. The enraged Keating demanded that John Howard, who the previous year had become Leader of the Opposition, discipline Tuckey; but Howard refused. Keating then promised to make Howard &quot;wear his leadership like a crown of thorns&quot;. Keating and Howard&#x27;s relationship, previously a civil one, deteriorated to the point where the two men refused to speak to one another. Reportedly, the last time they talked privately was when Keating stormed into Howard&#x27;s office, furiously berated him for not disciplining Tuckey, and walked out.

Tuckey was a member of the Opposition shadow ministry from 1984 to 1989 and again from 1993 to 1996. He was Deputy Manager of Opposition Business in the House from 1988 to 1989 and 1993 to 1994.

In 1989, a group of Liberal parliamentarians, including Tuckey, plotted to remove Howard from the Opposition leadership and give the position back to Andrew Peacock (who had already held it from 1983 to 1985). After the plan succeeded, Tuckey boasted about his actions in a Four Corners interview, which privately infuriated Howard.

Tuckey addressed an AIDS conference and opened by saying &quot;you don&#x27;t catch AIDS, you let somebody give it to you&quot;.

===Frontbencher===
As Minister for Forestry and Conservation from 1998 to 2001, Tuckey angered conservation groups through his support for the forestry industry. In 2002, he blamed the environmentalist movement for Australia&#x27;s severe bushfire problem, saying that their opposition to controlled burning in national parks increased the risk of fires.

In a reshuffle after the 2001 election, Tuckey was made Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government. His ministerial demise came in August 2003, when it was revealed that Tuckey had written to South Australian Police minister Patrick Conlon, on ministerial letterhead, asking Conlon to &quot;review&quot; his son&#x27;s conviction on a traffic charge. Howard said that Tuckey&#x27;s actions were foolish but refused to dismiss him. Tuckey resigned shortly afterwards and returned to the backbench.

===Backbencher===

In 2005, when the Australian parliament passed a motion asking Singaporean authorities that Van Tuong Nguyen not be executed for drug smuggling, Tuckey was the only member of parliament who refused to support the motion.

Tuckey was often quoted in the media as supporting free markets and less government intervention in the economy. He is also well known for criticising the National Party on a number of issues. He was the most outspoken critic of the AWB in Federal Parliament, and he led the push for this board to be stripped of its export monopoly for wheat. Tuckey labelled National Party politicians who supported the single-desk system as &quot;drongos&quot;. He also labelled National Party senator Barnaby Joyce a &quot;lightweight&quot; for arguing in favour of foreign ownership restrictions on Medibank Private after privatization.

In August 2006, Tuckey had a public argument with Labor leader Kim Beazley over new immigration laws, ending with Tuckey calling Beazley a &quot;fat so and so&quot;. A year later, Tuckey sent a fax to John Howard and several Liberal MPs suggesting the Prime Minister relinquish the leadership.

Queensland Aboriginal activist Sam Watson, in January 2008, branded Tuckey an &quot;extreme racist&quot; after Tuckey had publicly deplored the decision to display traditional dancers from one of the Aboriginal tribes which historically resides near Parliament House at the opening of Federal Parliament. Watson concluded, &quot;Mr Tuckey and his extremist racist views really do belong to another generation&quot;.

On 13 February 2008, Tuckey walked out during the opening of the 42nd Australian Federal Parliament immediately after prayers, and pointedly before the Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a motion of apology to the Stolen Generation. He was one of six Liberal MPs (including fellow West Australian MPs Luke Simpkins, Dennis Jensen and the late Don Randall as well as Sophie Mirabella and the late Alby Schultz) to leave the house in protest to the apology to the Stolen Generations, thereby boycotting the motion. On the steps of parliament, Tuckey was sarcastic about what the apology would achieve for indigenous people:
&quot;I&#x27;m there to say hallelujah. Tomorrow there&#x27;ll be no petrol sniffing, tomorrow little girls can sleep in their beds without any concern — it&#x27;s all fixed. The Rudd spin will fix it all. I&#x27;ve read it, I&#x27;m convinced. I think it&#x27;s wonderful&quot;.

The following May, Tuckey was expelled from the house for 24 hours after breaching standards. His remarks against the Speaker arose during a heated question time in relation to the Rudd government&#x27;s &#x27;Fuel Watch Scheme&#x27;. On 24 September 2008, Tuckey was again expelled from the house, this time for one hour, for an outburst during House of Representatives Question Time.

In March 2010, Tuckey said that acknowledging traditional landowners at official events was a &quot;farce&quot; and that he had &quot;never thanked anyone for the right to be on the soil that is Australian&quot;.

===Defeat===
From 1983 to 2007, Tuckey held O&#x27;Connor without serious difficulty, usually taking between 62 and 75 percent of the two-party preferred vote. At the 2007 federal election, Tuckey was reelected with 46 percent of the primary vote and a two-party margin of 67 percent against Labor.

However, at the 2010 federal election, Tuckey was defeated by Nationals WA candidate Tony Crook. He suffered a post-redistribution primary vote swing of 10 percent and a two-candidate swing of 20 percent, finishing on a primary vote of 38 percent and a two-candidate vote of 46 percent against Crook. He was 75 years old at the time of his defeat, making him the oldest sitting MP.

Tuckey broke his self-imposed silence after the election, verbally attacking Crook on a range of fronts. Tuckey described Crook as &quot;a nobody who would be lucky to have his relatives turn up to hear his maiden speech in parliament&quot;.

In 2009, the year before his defeat he said he might seek to become the longest serving member of parliament by breaking the record held by former Prime Minister Billy Hughes. However his defeat in 2010 dashed hopes of him achieving this record as it ended his 30 years in Parliament, nowhere near the 51 years served by Hughes from 1901 until his death in 1952. It is also worthy of note that to match Hughes&#x27; record, Tuckey would have to have served as a Member until 2031, by which time he would be 96 years old.

Tuckey was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 2024 Australia Day Honours for &quot;service to the people and Parliament of Australia&quot;.

<text>Alan Douglas Ruck (born July 1, 1956) is an American actor. He is known for portraying Cameron Frye in John Hughes&#x27; film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1986), as well as television roles as Stuart Bondek on the ABC sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot; (1996–2002) and Connor Roy on the HBO series &quot;Succession&quot; (2018–2023), the latter earning him Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe Award nominations. His other film credits include &quot;Bad Boys&quot; (1983), &quot;Three Fugitives&quot; (1989), &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990), &quot;Speed&quot; (1994), &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), and &quot;Twister&quot; (1996).

==Early life==
Ruck was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to a schoolteacher mother and a father who worked for a pharmaceutical company. He attended Parma Senior High School in Parma, Ohio, and graduated from the University of Illinois with a B.F.A. in drama in 1979. He recalled:

==Career==
Ruck&#x27;s first film role was in the 1983 drama film &quot;Bad Boys&quot;, in which he played Carl Brennan, Sean Penn&#x27;s friend in the film. The same year, he played Roger Jackson in &quot;Class&quot;. 

Ruck made his Broadway debut in 1985 in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Biloxi Blues&quot; with Matthew Broderick. He was soon a stage actor at theaters around the U.S., including the Wisdom Bridge Theatre in Chicago. 

Ruck played Cameron Frye in John Hughes&#x27; 1986 comedy &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, as the title character&#x27;s hypochondriac best friend, after Broderick encouraged him to audition for the role; their real-life friendship was reportedly a factor in Ruck being cast. One of his other film roles was in the 1987 film &quot;Three for the Road&quot;.

Ruck later appeared in the 1989 comedy film &quot;Three Fugitives&quot;. Following that, he played Hendry William French in &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, the 1990 sequel to &quot;Young Guns&quot;. He played Captain Jonathan Harriman of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B in the 1994 film &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, a role that he reprised, along with &quot;Generations&quot; co-star Walter Koenig and other &quot;Trek&quot; alumni, in the fan film &quot;Of Gods and Men&quot;. Alan played an annoying tourist named Doug Stephens on an ill-fated bus in the 1994 blockbuster &quot;Speed&quot;. Another supporting role was of the eccentric storm chaser Robert &#x27;Rabbit&#x27; Nurick in the 1996 disaster film &quot;Twister&quot;.

From 1990 to 1991, Ruck starred as Chicago ad man Charlie Davis, in the ABC series &quot;Going Places&quot;. ABC canceled the series after one season. He appeared in the series &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Girls&quot; in 1994, which was canceled after three episodes. From 1996 to 2002, Alan played Stuart Bondek in the sitcom &quot;Spin City&quot; alongside Michael J. Fox and later, Charlie Sheen. In 2005, he played Leo Bloom in the Broadway version of Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Producers&quot;, a role also played by Broderick, his &quot;Ferris Bueller&quot; co-star.

Ruck was then cast in the pilot of the Tim Minear-created Fox Network series &quot;Drive&quot;, but did not appear in the series. He also starred in one episode of the Comedy Central sitcom &quot;Stella&quot; as Richard, a man looking for work. He later starred in the season two &quot;Scrubs&quot; episode &quot;My Lucky Day&quot; as a patient, and played reporter Steve Jacobson on the ESPN miniseries &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot;.

In 1998, Ruck guest-starred in the fifth episode of the HBO miniseries &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; as the NASA engineer Tom Dolan.
In 2006, Ruck guest-starred in a single episode of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; called &quot;The Real World&quot; and, in 2007, as unscrupulous property developer Albert Bunford in an episode of &quot;Medium&quot;.

In the 2007 comedy &quot;Kickin&#x27; It Old Skool&quot;, he appears as Dr. Frye, a possible connection to Cameron Frye; he even mentions still trying to pay off an old Ferrari, a reference to Cameron totaling his dad&#x27;s Ferrari in &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;.

Ruck played the part of a ghost of a family man in the 2008 film &quot;Ghost Town,&quot; which starred Ricky Gervais. Ruck also had a small role in the 2008 M. Night Shyamalan film &quot;The Happening&quot;. 

In 2009, he had a minor role in an episode of &quot;Cougar Town&quot;: Frank, who has problems with his marriage due to a crush he had long ago on Jules, played by Courteney Cox. He played the role of Dean Bowman in the college fraternity drama &quot;Greek&quot;. He appeared in a guest role as a manic geologist in an episode of &quot;Eureka&quot;. He played Mr. Cooverman in the film &quot;I Love You, Beth Cooper&quot;. In 2009, Ruck filmed the medical drama &quot;Extraordinary Measures&quot; in Portland, Oregon, with star Harrison Ford.

Ruck appeared as a bank robber in a season three episode of the USA Network series &quot;Psych&quot;, and as a lawyer in season five of the ABC series &quot;Boston Legal&quot;. He guest-starred as Martin, a magazine reporter, on an episode of &quot;Ruby &amp; the Rockits&quot; entitled &quot;We Are Family?&quot;

In 2010, Ruck was cast as a lead character in the NBC mystery-drama, &quot;Persons Unknown&quot;. He guest-starred on the television show &quot;Fringe&quot; as a scientist turned criminal, in the &quot;&quot; season two episode &quot;Borderline&quot;, and guest-starred as ex-money laundering accountant turned dentist on an episode of &quot;Justified&quot; entitled &quot;Long in the Tooth&quot;. He appeared in the &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; season five episode &quot;In The Midnight Hour&quot;.

In 2012, Ruck was cast in the ABC Family series &quot;Bunheads&quot; as the husband to Sutton Foster&#x27;s character, Michelle. In 2013, he appeared in &quot;NCIS&quot;, guest-starring in the season 11 episode, &quot;Gut Check&quot;.

In autumn 2016, Ruck began a 10-episode run on &quot;The Exorcist&quot; as Henry Rance, the husband (who has suffered mild brain damage in a vaguely explained accident) of Angela Rance (Geena Davis), better known as the adult Regan MacNeil, the tortured girl (played by Linda Blair) who is possessed by a demon in the 1973 hit film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. 

From 2018 to 2023, Ruck played the role of Connor Roy, the eldest son of a media magnate, in the HBO series &quot;Succession&quot;. He was part of the cast&#x27;s win for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2022. In 2023, he received Golden Globe, SAG, and Emmy nominations.

==Personal life==
Ruck was married to actress Claudia Stefany from 1984 to 2005, with whom he has two children. Since 2008, he has been married to actress Mireille Enos, whom he met in 2005 while co-starring in the Broadway revival of &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot;. They have two children. 

On October 31, 2023, Ruck was involved in a car crash in Los Angeles. For unknown reasons, he lost control of his Rivian R1T, hit several vehicles, and crashed into the side of a pizza restaurant.

<text>Michael Bibby (born May 13, 1978) is an American former professional basketball player. He played for 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He last served as the head coach for Hillcrest Prep Academy in Phoenix, Arizona. Bibby played college basketball for the Arizona Wildcats, with whom he won the 1997 NCAA Championship. He was drafted second overall by the Vancouver Grizzlies in the 1998 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team in his first season with the Grizzlies. He also played for the Sacramento Kings, Atlanta Hawks, Washington Wizards, Miami Heat, and New York Knicks.

==Early life==
Bibby attended Shadow Mountain High School, and won an Arizona state championship as a point guard under coach Jerry Conner. He is the son of professional basketball player Henry Bibby and the nephew of Major League Baseball pitcher Jim Bibby.

==College career==
As a freshman at Arizona playing under coach Lute Olson, Bibby helped lead the Wildcats to the NCAA championship in 1997, scoring 19 points in the overtime, 84–79 NCAA Championship Game win versus the University of Kentucky and finished third in the voting for the 1998 Wooden Award. He was selected to the ’97 All-Final Four Team, after also being named Pac-10 Freshman of the Year after posting averages of 13.5 ppg, 5.2 apg and 3.2 rpg. Bibby and his father are one of four father-son duos to each win an NCAA basketball championship.

His sophomore year was just as impressive, as he was named Pac-10 Player of the Year (1997–98), after averaging 17.2 ppg, 5.7 apg, and 3.0 rpg (.464 FG%, .387 3FG%, .755 FT%). He started all 69 games during his Wildcat career and earned First-Team All-America honors after his sophomore campaign.

Following his sophomore season, Bibby entered the 1998 NBA Draft and was seen as the favorite to be selected by the Los Angeles Clippers with the first overall pick and was selected by the Vancouver Grizzlies with the second overall pick.

==NBA career==
===Vancouver Grizzlies (1998–2001)===
In his rookie season, Bibby averaged 13.2 points, 6.5 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game, earning NBA All-Rookie honors during the season which was abbreviated by a labor dispute. He improved those numbers in his next two seasons with the team, averaging 14.5 points per game during the 99-00 season and 15.9 points per game as well as what would be a career-best 8.4 assists per game during the 00-01 season, but the Grizzlies continued to struggle. On January 16, 2000, and April 2, 2000, Bibby twice tied Vancouver&#x27;s franchise record for steals in a single game with seven. On June 27, 2001, Bibby and Brent Price were traded to the Sacramento Kings for Jason Williams and Nick Anderson.

===Sacramento Kings (2001–2008)===

In his first season with Sacramento, Bibby formed one of the league&#x27;s best duos alongside Chris Webber. The two of them guided the Kings to an NBA best-record at 61–21 and a Pacific division title over their archrivals the Los Angeles Lakers, who at the time were the two-time defending NBA Champions. In the first two rounds of the playoffs, they easily defeated the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks, setting up a Western Conference Finals match-up against the Lakers. The 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Lakers was one of the most memorable in league history. Bibby&#x27;s performance during the series, perhaps most memorably his Game 5 game-winner, earned him a reputation as a clutch performer, and as a reward, he was granted a 7-year, $80.5 million contract.

During the 2002–03 season, Bibby was hampered by injuries, playing in only 55 games, but still averaged a respectable 15.9 points per game with the Kings going 59–23 and securing second seed in the West, as well as a second-consecutive division title. They faced the Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks in the first two rounds respectively for the second consecutive playoffs, but after defeating the Jazz, 4–1, lost to the Mavericks in seven games. The Kings had lost Chris Webber to season-ending injury in game 2 against Dallas, but still forced the series to seven games.

For the 2003–04 season, Bibby posted some of the best numbers of his career, scoring 1,506 points (18.4 per game) and helping the Kings reach the playoffs. Bibby helped to lift the Kings over the Dallas Mavericks in the first round, scoring a career playoff-best 36 points in the clinching Game 5. They would go on to lose in the second round for the second consecutive year, this time to the Minnesota Timberwolves 4–3.

The next two seasons would see Sacramento taking yet another step backwards, losing in the opening round of the playoffs in both years. During the 2005–06 season, Bibby started all 82 games, and averaged a career-high 21.1 points per game. They would lose in the first round of the playoffs to the defending-champion Spurs 4–2.

Bibby was made a guest of honor by the Sacramento Kings, as he sat court side to watch the game against the Chicago Bulls on November 20, 2014. Along with former teammate Chris Webber, the pair were introduced to the crowd along with video clips as part of the team honoring its legends.

===Atlanta Hawks (2008–2011)===

On February 16, 2008, the Atlanta Hawks acquired Bibby in exchange for Shelden Williams, Anthony Johnson, Tyronn Lue, Lorenzen Wright and a 2008 second-round draft pick (which was used to select Sean Singletary.

Battling injuries and joining a Hawks team that was 22–28, Bibby put up 14.1 points and 6.6 assists per game while working in an unfamiliar offense to lead the Hawks to their first playoff berth in eight years. Despite being the eighth seed and expected to be swept out of the first round, Bibby helped the Hawks force an improbable seven-game series against the Boston Celtics, who went on to win the NBA Championship.

The next season, Bibby averaged 15 points, 5 assists and 1.2 steals per game to help the Hawks win their first playoff series since 1999, against the Miami Heat. The Hawks lost in the conference semifinals against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bibby was also selected as a participant for the Three Point Shooting Competition.

On July 7, 2009, Bibby and the Hawks agreed to a three-year deal worth about $18 million. In the same offseason, the Hawks traded for Jamal Crawford and drafted Jeff Teague. Though Bibby would remain the Hawks starting point guard, he was not relied on to be a top scorer, as he had in years past. Bibby was credited for his leadership and unselfishness that helped Atlanta to consecutive playoff appearances.

===Washington Wizards (2011)===

On February 23, 2011, Atlanta traded Bibby to the Washington Wizards, along with Jordan Crawford, Maurice Evans and a first-round pick in the 2011 draft, in exchange for Kirk Hinrich and Hilton Armstrong. On February 28, 2011, after playing two games for Washington, Bibby agreed to a contract buyout. He gave up his following year&#x27;s entire $6.2 million salary in hopes of joining a contending team, such as the Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs or Miami Heat, all of whom expressed interest in Bibby.

===Miami Heat (2011)===

On March 2, 2011, the Miami Heat signed Bibby after he cleared waivers. He became the Heat&#x27;s starting point guard and started all 20 playoff games he appeared in, en route to the first NBA Finals of his career. Playing against the Dallas Mavericks, the Heat were defeated 4 games to 2. Following the season, Miami elected to re-sign the younger Mario Chalmers and draft Norris Cole over re-signing Bibby.

===New York Knicks (2011–2012)===
After the NBA lockout, Bibby signed a one-year contract with the New York Knicks, bringing his career full circle to the team that drafted his father, Henry. Backing up Jeremy Lin during the &quot;Linsanity&quot; phenomenon, Bibby saw limited playing time prior to Lin&#x27;s season-ending injury. He and Baron Davis split starting point guard duties through the rest of the season and in New York&#x27;s first round playoff series against Bibby&#x27;s former team and eventual champion Miami.

At season&#x27;s end his contract expired, and he was deemed unlikely to return to the team, after New York signed Raymond Felton and Jason Kidd.

==Coaching career==
Bibby coached his son Michael Jr. on the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) club Team Bibby. In 2013, he returned to his alma mater, Shadow Mountain High School, as an assistant basketball coach. He working alongside his former high school coach Jerry Connor, who had also returned that year. Michael Jr. was the starting point guard for the Matadors varsity team, which also included two other teammates from Bibby&#x27;s AAU team. Conner held the head coach title, but Bibby was the de facto leader of the team. After Shadow Mountain won the state championship that year, Conner left to coach another school, leaving Bibby to run the team as an assistant coach. At the time, Bibby did not hold the certifications for the head coach title.

In February 2019, the Paradise Valley Unified School District confirmed that Bibby was under investigation by Phoenix police for allegedly sexually abusing a teacher at Shadow Mountain High, where Bibby had since become head coach. The teacher alleged that in February 2017 Bibby made sexually explicit statements to her, groped her, and rubbed his genitals against her. As a result of the allegations, he was removed as head coach of the Shadow Mountain High basketball team. In April, the police said that they did not find probable cause for filing charges against Bibby.

Bibby was hired by Hillcrest Prep in Phoenix in October 2019, coaching them for 10 games before both sides mutually parted ways.

==Personal life==
Bibby is the son of Henry Bibby, a former NBA and UCLA player and former USC basketball coach. Mike&#x27;s mother, Virginia, is a native of Trinidad and Tobago. Mike is the nephew of the late former Major League Baseball player Jim Bibby (1944–2010), and the brother-in-law of former Miami Heat teammate Eddie House, who was also his Sacramento Kings teammate during the 2004–05 season. Mike also has two cousins who became professional athletes, US national team soccer player Robbie Findley and former NFL wide receiver Shaun McDonald. Bibby and his wife, Darcy, have four children. His son, Michael Jr. played college ball for South Florida before transferring to Appalachian State in 2017.

Two decades after leaving college for the NBA, Bibby graduated from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with a Bachelor of Arts in multidisciplinary studies in 2017.

<doc id="626155" wikidata="Q738582" url="?curid=626155" title="Kluane National Park and Reserve">
<text>Kluane National Park and Reserve (; ) are two protected areas in the southwest corner of the territory of Yukon. The National Park Reserve was set aside in 1972 to become a national park, pending settlement of First Nations land claims. It covered an area of . When agreement was reached with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations over an eastern portion of the Reserve, that part—about —became a national park in 1993, and is a unit of the national park system administered co-operatively with Parks Canada. The larger western section remains a Reserve, awaiting a final land claim settlement with the Kluane First Nation. The park borders British Columbia to the south, while the Reserve borders both British Columbia to the south, and the United States (Alaska) to the south and west. 

The Reserve includes the highest mountain in Canada, Mount Logan () of the Saint Elias Mountains. Mountains and glaciers, including Donjek Glacier, dominate the park&#x27;s landscape, covering 83% of its area. The rest of the land in the park is forest and tundra—east of the largest mountains and glaciers—where the climate is colder and drier than in the western and southern parts of the park. Trees grow only at the park&#x27;s lowest elevations. The primary tree species are white spruce, balsam poplar and trembling aspen.

==Activities==
A day-use area with boat launch, picnic facilities and campground is located at Kathleen Lake, and is operated from mid-May to mid-September. Hiking is a popular activity on trails such as St. Elias Lake, Mush Lake Road, Shorty Creek, Cottonwood, Rock Glacier, King&#x27;s Throne, Kokanee, Auriol, Dezadeash River Trail, Alsek Trail, Sheep Creek Trail, Bullion Plateau Trail, Slims West or Soldiers Summit. Rafting on the Alsek River (a Canadian Heritage river), mountain biking on old mining roads, horseback riding through the &quot;Alsek Pass&quot;, boating on Kathleen Lake and Mush Lake as well as fishing for lake trout, Arctic grayling, rainbow trout, northern pike and sockeye salmon are also among activities available in the park.

The park was the subject of a short film in 2011&#x27;s &quot;National Parks Project&quot;, directed by Louise Archambault and scored by Graham Van Pelt, Ian D&#x27;Sa and Mishka Stein.

In August 2013, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. visited the park to see Mount Kennedy, named as a memorial to his uncle, U.S. president John F. Kennedy.

==Fauna==
Mammalian species that inhabit this park include Yukon wolf, bear, coyote, mink, lynx, river otter, caribou, Yukon moose, muskrat, snowshoe hare, marmot, red fox, Dall sheep, beaver, wolverine, mountain goat, and arctic ground squirrel.

<text>Lagos State (, ) is a state in South West, Nigeria. Of the 36 Nigerian states, Lagos is the second most populous state but the smallest in terms of land mass. Bounded to the south by the Bight of Benin and to the west by the international border with Benin for 10 km, Lagos State borders Ogun State to the north for about 283 km, making it the only Nigerian state to border only one other state. Named for the city of Lagos—the most populous city in Africa—the state was formed from the Western Region and the former Federal Capital Territory on 27 May 1967.

Geographically, Lagos State is dominated by bodies of water with nearly a quarter of the state&#x27;s area covered with bodies of water. The largest of these bodies are the Lagos and Lekki lagoons in the state&#x27;s interior with the Ogun and Osun rivers flowing into them. Many other rivers and creeks flow throughout the state and serve as vital means of transportation for people and goods. On land, non-urbanized areas are within the tropical Nigerian lowland forests ecoregion with natural areas containing threatened populations of mona monkey, tree pangolin, and hooded vulture along with a transitory population of African bush elephants. Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are large fish populations along with African manatees and crocodiles.

Lagos State has been inhabited for years by various indigenous ethnic groups, primarily the majority Yoruba people who live throughout the state but also the Ewe and Ogu peoples in the far west. As a result of migration since the nineteenth century, Lagos State also has large populations of non-native Nigerian ethnic groups with Edo, Fulani, Hausa, Igbo, Ijaw, Ibibio, Efik, and Nupe peoples among other Nigerian groups. There are also groups from outside of Nigeria&#x27;s modern borders with the Saro (Sierra Leonean) and Amaro (Brazilian) groups being descendants of formerly enslaved people who returned to Africa in the 1800s with a longstanding Middle Eastern Nigerian community (mainly Syrian and Lebanese Nigerians) also forming a significant part of Lagos&#x27; population along with recent immigrants from Benin, China, Ghana, India, Togo, and the United Kingdom. Religiously, the state is also diverse, as there is a sizable number of Christian, Muslim and traditional ethnic religions.

In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Lagos State was mainly fishing villages and ports that at various points were controlled by states including the Oyo Empire and Benin Kingdom until the early 1800s when the city of Lagos had developed into a major kingdom of its own right. In 1850, the British successfully attacked the kingdom in the Bombardment of Lagos before installing an ally as Oba and signing a treaty that established Lagos as being under British protection. Ten years later, the forced Lagos Treaty of Cession led to the formal establishment of the Lagos Colony. In 1906, the colony was incorporated into the new Southern Nigeria Protectorate which merged into British Nigeria in 1914 with the city of Lagos as its capital. Upon independence in 1960, Lagos remained as the capital with much of the city forming the Federal Capital Territory while the rest of modern-day Lagos State was a part of the Western Region until 1967 when the region was split and the area became Lagos State.

Economically, Lagos State is one of the fastest-growing urban areas in the world. It contains the most populous city in Nigeria and one of the most important states in the country, a major financial centre and has one of the largest economies in Africa with a gross domestic product of $84 billion comparable with Ghana&#x27;s $75 billion, Angola&#x27;s $70 billion, and Ethiopia&#x27;s $93 billion. Lagos State is also a key culture, education, and transportation hub for Nigeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, the state also has the highest literacy rate in Nigeria. It is known for its vibrant culture, bustling markets, and significant economic activities. Despite overcrowding and chronic debilitating traffic, Lagos State has the highest Human Development Index in Nigeria and numerous developmental projects.

==History==
===Early history===
Before the Portuguese name of Lagos had been adopted, Lagos&#x27; initial name was Eko which referred mainly to the Island. The first to settle in Eko were the Aworis. Trade later drew various groups to the island, including the Portuguese in the 16th century. The Awori hunters and fishermen had originally come from Ile-Ife to the coast.

It was in 1760 that the name Lagos was adopted by the Portuguese. Naming it after a city in Southern Portugal which was used as port for slave trade. In 1861, Oba Docemo was the one who signed the treaty making Lagos a British colony.

===Post-colonial era===
Lagos State was created on 27 May 1967 according to the &quot;State Creation and Transitional Provisions Decree No. 14 of 1967&quot;, which restructured Nigeria into a federation of 12 states. Before the issuance of this Decree, Lagos city, which was the country&#x27;s capital had been administered directly by the Federal Government through the &quot;Federal Ministry of Lagos Affairs&quot;. However, Ikeja, Agege, Mushin, Ikorodu, Epe, Surulere, and Badagry were administered by the then Western Region Government. Lagos, the city, along with these other towns were captured to create the state of Lagos, with the state becoming fully recognized as a semi-autonomous administrative division on 11 April 1968. Lagos served the dual role of being the State and Federal Capital until 1976 when the capital of the state was moved to Ikeja. After the full establishment of the Federal Capital Territory, based on the recommendation of the Akinola Àgùdà–led committee set up by General Murtala Muhammed to review the need for a new capital for Nigeria in 1975. The seat of the Federal Government was formally relocated to Abuja on 12 December 1991. Nevertheless, Lagos remains the financial centre of the country, and even grew to become the most populous city in the state and the country.

Serious health concerns have been raised as a result of the unchecked discharge of raw sewage, sediment-carrying runoff, and effluents into the Lagoon system. People are suffering from deadly waterborne illnesses like cholera and diarrhea as a result. The number of Lagos inhabitants who have access to formal clean water is pitifully small, with most of them reliant on the unofficial sector made up of wells. Lagos has a tropical environment with over 2,000 millimeters of annual rainfall, is surrounded by water, however much of the water is unsafe to drink. The bulk of Lagos inhabitants rely on the unofficial sector, which consists of wells, boreholes, rivers, and rains, as there is very little access to formal clean water.

<text>Dalís Car were a musical group formed in 1984 by Peter Murphy (vocalist), Mick Karn (bassist, keyboardist, guitarist, saxophonist) and Paul Vincent Lawford (drum machines).

==History==
One year after Bauhaus broke up, Peter Murphy, after taking a hiatus from his music career, wished again to record. However, at the time he had difficulties creating music, for his bandmates from Bauhaus had come up with the musical ideas. Murphy&#x27;s input was limited to writing and interpreting lyrics, creating vocal rhythms, adding vocal parts into songs. Also, despite Murphy&#x27;s input to the occasional sound effect on a Wasp synthesiser, playing a few percussion instruments and efforts of basic guitar, he did not play any musical instruments professionally. He later explained this: &quot;As a solo artist I had to learn to make records without this machine I had been part of. I had no skill. No idea what I should do. I was suddenly a solo person writing from where? From what perspective? So I was looking to find what I had to offer.&quot; Murphy was in need of a collaborator at the time. Around the same time, the bass player Mick Karn, from the art pop band Japan who had split up in 1982, was struggling with his solo career. Despite his musical ability, recorded demos and session work, Karn was struggling to get a record deal since he was mainly interested in making instrumental music rather than pop songs. In order to secure a record deal, he needed to convince a record company that his work has commercial prospects. Karn was looking for a frontman.

In 1984, Murphy and Karn formed Dalís Car. The band was formed soon after Murphy and Karn left their former bands (Bauhaus and Japan, respectively). The origin of the band began with Murphy&#x27;s interview by a Japanese journalist for the magazine &quot;Music Life&quot;, in which he spoke of his admiration for Mick Karn&#x27;s work and his unique bass style. The same journalist interviewed Karn a week before Murphy&#x27;s interview and had Karn&#x27;s telephone number. Murphy jotted Karn&#x27;s number down, and telephoned him for a conversation. This led to a meeting and dinner in a restaurant, and each discovered that they had a connection with the other; this led to the creation of Dalís Car along with drummer Paul Vincent Lawson. It was assumed that they took their name from a Captain Beefheart song from his album &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;. Despite the popular belief, this was apocryphal. Instead, the name came from a dream from Murphy&#x27;s friend, where he dreamed of buying a car belonging to Salvador Dalí. There were issues and conflicts during this time. Karn explained one issue on how each of them had a different way to construct music: &quot;There would be whole sections I&#x27;d leave for the vocals to take over the track, whereas Pete saw it from a completely different musical perspective; &quot;Well, this is such a nice musical break I don&#x27;t want to touch it.&quot;So I guess there was a certain amount of friction caused by that because we both heard the tracks in a completely different way.&quot; Another issue was their drummer, Paul Lawson. As Karn explained: &quot;He was supposed to be the other third of the band. Originally, that was the idea. He would be playing live drums – we got on with him very well, he was very young and eager – unfortunately when we got into the studio we found that nerves took over and he couldn’t actually play so much. So we ended up having him programme most of the patterns rather than play them.&quot; Despite not touring in front of live audience due to these previous issues, they did make a performance of their single &quot;His Box&quot; on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; where they played over a backing track. One commentator mentioned their reaction to their appearance in the performance by saying: &quot;In their sober suits they looked like investment bankers who had just had a bad day on the stock market&quot;. The group recorded only one album, titled &quot;The Waking Hour&quot;. The album went over budget and was not successful, and despite Karn&#x27;s willingness to continue with the group, Murphy was not interested based on the lack of success. In fact, he did not even show up when Karn established the bonus tracks for their single, preferring to stay in Turkey with his wife. According to Karn: &quot;by that point it became obvious that Peter didn&#x27;t want to carry on with it.&quot;

===&quot;The Waking Hour&quot;===
The sleeve of &quot;The Waking Hour&quot; features a detail from Maxfield Parrish&#x27;s seminal painting &quot;Daybreak&quot;. The recording of the album took place in unusual circumstances; Karn and Murphy did not spend much time together in the recording studio, preferring to send tapes back and forth between each other, to work on alone. One single was released, &quot;The Judgement Is the Mirror&quot; (UK No. 66). Much of the video for the single was recorded on location in Malta.

===Reunion and subsequent releases===
In August 2010, Peter Murphy announced on Twitter that he and Karn were planning to head into the studio in September to begin work on the second Dalís Car album. The project was cut short, however, for Karn had recently been diagnosed with cancer; he died on 4 January 2011. The tracks they did record—including a re-working of &quot;Artemis&quot; from &quot;The Waking Hour&quot; with newly added vocals, guitar, and drums, and renamed &quot;Artemis Rise&quot;—were released on 5 April 2012 as an EP titled &quot;InGladAloneness&quot;. The tracks were mixed by Steve Jansen, mastered by Pieter Snapper in Istanbul, and the artwork for the EP was created by Murphy with Thomas Bak with a painting by Jarosław Kukowski. The Japanese version of the EP contains a memorial photo booklet with photos by Steve Jansen along with comments from fellow artists who have collaborated with Karn.

&quot;Artemis Rise&quot; was made available as a download through the Burning Shed MK Music store on Sunday 24 July 2011, to commemorate what would have been Karn&#x27;s 53rd birthday. The song is an updated version of the song as it appeared on &quot;The Waking Hour&quot;, with added vocals by Murphy, drums by Jansen, and guitar by Jakszyk.

<doc id="626183" wikidata="Q2369973" url="?curid=626183" title="LoDo, Denver">
<text>LoDo (Lower Downtown) is an unofficial neighborhood in Denver, Colorado, and is one of the oldest places of settlement in the city. It is a mixed-use historic district, known for its nightlife, and serves as an example of success in urban reinvestment and revitalization. The current population is approximately 21,145.

==History==
Prior to European exploration of the area, Native Americans, particularly the Arapaho tribe, established encampments along the South Platte River near or in what is now LoDo. In 1858, after the discovery of gold in the river, General William Larimer founded Denver by putting down cottonwood logs in the center of a square mile plot that would eventually be the current LoDo neighborhood, making LoDo both the original city of Denver, as well as its oldest neighborhood. Then, like now, LoDo was a bustling and sometimes wild area known for its saloons and brothels. During the Sand Creek Massacre, it was LoDo where the heads of the slaughtered Arapaho tribe were paraded in victory.

As Denver grew, city leaders realized a railroad was needed to keep Denver a strong city, especially when the transcontinental railroad bypassed Denver for Cheyenne, Wyoming. In 1870, after much cajoling from town leaders, residents passed bonds that brought a rail spur from Cheyenne. This and later train lines ended up in the Central Platte Valley, adjacent to LoDo. Union Station became the place most people traveled into the city and LoDo would be the first part of the city they would see. This section eventually became Denver&#x27;s Chinatown from the 1870s to the 1880s, only to be torn down by race riots.

By the mid-twentieth century, what was once a thriving business area had become a skid row. As highways and airports diminished the dominance of passenger railroad transportation, the importance of Union Station, LoDo&#x27;s most prominent building, waned.
The Lower Downtown Historic District, known as LoDo, was created by the enactment of a zoning ordinance by Denver City Council in March 1988. The resolution&#x27;s intent was to encourage historic preservation and to promote economic and social vitality in Denver&#x27;s founding neighborhood at a time when it still held significant historic and architectural value. The status granted by this special designation provided protection to the community&#x27;s archivable resources and to the 127 contributing historic structures that remained after roughly 20% of Lower Downtown&#x27;s buildings had been demolished through DURA policies in the 1960s and 1970s. LoDo&#x27;s historic district ordinance includes zoning that restricts building height and encourages mixed-use development. It stipulates strict design guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction. These guidelines have been challenged by out-of-state developers but are vigorously defended by residents.

During this time, the neighborhood began its renaissance and new businesses opened. Gradually LoDo became a destination neighborhood. By the time Coors Field opened on the edge of the LoDo Historic District in 1995, the area had revitalized itself, becoming a new, hip neighborhood filled with clubs, restaurants, art galleries, boutiques, bars, and other businesses. Pepsi Center, located on the other edge of the neighborhood, opened in 1999 and further established the neighborhood as a sport fan&#x27;s paradise. New residential development came to LoDo, transforming old warehouses into pricey new lofts.

==Geography==
The B-7 zoned historic district is roughly bordered by:
*Cherry Creek/Speer Boulevard
*Wewatta Street (excluding Union Station)
*20th Street
*The alley between Market and Larimer Streets

When referring to the greater LoDo area, people often include adjacent neighborhoods that are not a part of the official historic district, but encompass LoDo&#x27;s sphere of influence. This unofficial greater area includes Larimer Square, the Auraria Campus, Riverfront Park, the Central Platte Valley, Union Station North, River North, and the Ballpark neighborhoods.

LoDo is located in north-central Denver, directly northwest of the downtown CBD, near the confluence of Cherry Creek and the South Platte River.

==Economy==

Land in the Lower Downtown Historic District is zoned B-7, which includes building height limitations and encourages mixed-use development and provides strict design guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction. Projects must go through an architectural design review, which allows LoDo to retain its pedestrian scale and historic character as it continues to densify.

The average cost of a home in LoDo in May of 2016 was $701,286.

==Oxford Hotel==
The Oxford Hotel, built in 1891, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Cruise Room is a hotel bar with historic art deco interior, that was operated as an illicit speakeasy.

==Wynkoop Brewing Company==

The Wynkoop Brewing Company, a brewpub founded in 1988 by Colorado&#x27;s 42nd Governor John Hickenlooper with partners Russell Schehrer, Mark Schiffler, and Jerry Williams, sponsors the &quot;Beerdrinker of the Year&quot; competition, which is hosted yearly in one of the banquet halls. The Wynkoop has a large billiards hall on its top floor.

==Arts and culture==
In the summer of 2006, LoDo hosted the cast members of MTV&#x27;s popular reality show &quot;The Real World&quot;, as season 18: &quot;The Real World: Denver&quot;. Several movies have also been filmed, wholly or in part, in the neighborhood, including the Eddie Murphy film &quot;Imagine That&quot; (2009). LoDo&#x27;s combination of contemporary architecture sprinkled among historic buildings, beautiful mountain views, access to Cherry Creek and nearby parks, plus its proximity to two major sporting venues, make it an attractive location for television and movie filming.

The 70+ bars and restaurants in the historic district provide a positive economic impact for the city. However, late night violence, including a fatal shooting, has caused concern. The police are increasing foot patrols and asking private security officers to assist with the 2:00 am &quot;let out&quot; period. A security task force, made up of members of the public, Denver Police, neighborhood and business associations, and bar and club owners has convened to examine the issue.

==Community==
The LoDo District, Inc., a non-profit neighborhood and business association, represents both the residential and commercial communities, and functions as a LoDo-specific chamber of commerce, visitors bureau, registered neighborhood organization, advocacy agent, and marketing entity. The Lower Downtown Neighborhood Association, the residential association, is a non-profit organization committed to seeking quality living conditions amid the mixed uses of the Lower Downtown area.

Because of the numerous bars and clubs in the area, LoDo is also a popular location for the nightlife of Denver.

<doc id="626191" wikidata="Q885202" url="?curid=626191" title="Bloodbath">
<text>Bloodbath is a Swedish death metal supergroup from Stockholm, formed in 1998. The band has released six full-length albums, two EPs and two DVDs depicting their performances at Wacken Open Air (in 2005) and Bloodstock Open Air (in 2010). The group consists of Martin Axenrot (ex-Opeth), Anders Nyström (Katatonia), Jonas Renkse (also Katatonia) and Nick Holmes (Paradise Lost).

==History==
The band named themselves after the song &quot;Blood Bath&quot; from the album &quot;To the Gory End&quot; by extreme metal band Cancer. The initial lineup consisted of Mikael Åkerfeldt (Opeth) on vocals, Dan Swanö (Edge of Sanity, Nightingale) on drums, Anders &quot;Blakkheim&quot; Nyström (Katatonia, Diabolical Masquerade) on guitar, and Jonas Renkse (Katatonia, October Tide) on bass. Bloodbath released the EP &quot;Breeding Death&quot; within a year of forming. The EP was written within two days of the band forming. Nystrom said, &quot;that just shows that if you are with a like-minded bunch of people who all have their history within death metal, all are capable with their instruments, then of course you can knock out professional death metal in no time at all.&quot; The band&#x27;s debut EP was followed two years later by their debut album &quot;Resurrection Through Carnage&quot;.

In 2004, Åkerfeldt left Bloodbath, wanting to free up more time for his primary band Opeth, with Peter Tägtgren (Hypocrisy) being brought in to replace him. The lineup changed further, with Swanö switching to guitar and Martin Axenrot (Witchery, Satanic Slaughter, Opeth) filling the position of drummer. With these changes the size and subsequent scope of the band increased, expanding beyond that of what was initially only a secondary side project. The band&#x27;s second full release, &quot;Nightmares Made Flesh&quot;, was released in Europe in September 2004.

In February 2005, Tägtgren left the band citing &quot;conflicting schedules&quot;. That same year, Åkerfeldt rejoined for a single live show at Germany&#x27;s Wacken Open Air on 5 August. The band was quoted as saying, prior to the upcoming show, that it would be &quot;Not only the first, but also the last gig for Bloodbath (with Mikael Åkerfeldt on vocals)&quot;. It would later turn out to also be the last show with Swanö. In September 2005, Bloodbath began searching for a new lead singer.

In August 2006, the band announced the departure of Swanö due to musical differences, as well as Swanö being busy with other projects. They simultaneously closed the vocal auditions, announcing that no suitable singer had been found.

On 27 March 2007, the band announced that a new line-up would be unveiled, along with news that they were producing new material, to be released that summer. In August 2007, Renkse posted on the band&#x27;s official forums, suggesting that work was in progress. On 30 January 2008, it was announced via the Bloodbath website that Åkerfeldt would be rejoining the line-up on vocals, along with new member Per Eriksson (ex-21 Lucifers, ex-Genocrush Ferox) on guitar. In March 2008, the EP &quot;Unblessing the Purity&quot; was released. Also released in 2008 was the Wacken live CD/DVD &quot;The Wacken Carnage&quot;. Bloodbath released their third full-length album, &quot;The Fathomless Mastery&quot;, in October 2008.

On 25 April 2011, Bloodbath released their second DVD, &quot;Bloodbath over Bloodstock&quot;, containing their performance at Bloodstock Festival 2010, as well as the 2008 performance at Party San. On 1 November 2011, during the final show of the American Opeth/Katatonia tour at Rams Head Live! in Baltimore, Maryland, Bloodbath performed a surprise encore after Opeth&#x27;s set.

On 14 April 2012, Blakkheim announced that Åkerfeldt had officially left the group. When asked whether the new vocalist was known or not, Blakkheim was quoted saying &quot;Oh, he&#x27;s a legend!&quot;. On 16 September 2014, the band announced the new vocalist as Nick Holmes from Paradise Lost.

== Artistry ==
Guitarist Anders &quot;Blakkheim&quot; Nyström explained the band&#x27;s composition process: &quot;There has always been a lot of spontaneity with Bloodbath. The whole project was formed over two days, while we also recorded our first EP [Breeding Death] in that time. [...] We like things to be rapid; it keeps the magic going. If you just sit there and drag things out, you are going to lose interest in everything and you’re not going to maintain that kick-ass vibe. Knock it out fast and no regrets.&quot; The band uses the Boss HM-2 to achieve its guitar tone.

<doc id="626196" wikidata="Q4992058" url="?curid=626196" title="Electromagnetic propulsion">
<text>Electromagnetic propulsion (EMP) is the principle of accelerating an object by the utilization of a flowing electrical current and magnetic fields. The electrical current is used to either create an opposing magnetic field, or to charge a field, which can then be repelled. When a current flows through a conductor in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic force known as a Lorentz force, pushes the conductor in a direction perpendicular to the conductor and the magnetic field. This repulsing force is what causes propulsion in a system designed to take advantage of the phenomenon. The term electromagnetic propulsion (EMP) can be described by its individual components: electromagneticusing electricity to create a magnetic field, and propulsionthe process of propelling something. When a fluid (liquid or gas) is employed as the moving conductor, the propulsion may be termed magnetohydrodynamic drive. One key difference between EMP and propulsion achieved by electric motors is that the electrical energy used for EMP is not used to produce rotational energy for motion; though both use magnetic fields and a flowing electrical current.

The science of electromagnetic propulsion does not have origins with any one individual and has application in many different fields. The thought of using magnets for propulsion continues to this day and has been dreamed of since at least 1897 when John Munro published his fictional story &quot;A Trip to Venus&quot;. can be seen in maglev trains and military railguns. Other applications that remain not widely used or still in development include ion thruster for low orbiting satellites and magnetohydrodynamic drive for ships and submarines.

==History==

One of the first recorded discoveries regarding electromagnetic propulsion was in 1889 when Professor Elihu Thomson made public his work with electromagnetic waves and alternating currents. A few years later Emile Bachelet proposed the idea of a metal carriage levitated in air above the rails in a modern railway, which he showcased in the early 1890s. In the 1960s Eric Roberts Laithwaite developed the linear induction motor, which built upon these principles and introduced the first practical application of electromagnetic propulsion. In 1966 James R. Powell and Gordon Danby patented the superconducting maglev transportation system, and after this engineers around the world raced to create the first high-speed rail. From 1984 to 1995 the first commercial automated maglev system ran in Birmingham. It was a low speed Maglev shuttle that ran from the Birmingham International Airport to the Birmingham International Railway System.
In the USSR at the beginning of 1960th at the Institute of Hydrodynamics, Novosibirsk, Russia, prof. V.F. Minin laid down the experimental foundations of electromagnetic accelerating of bodies to hypersonic velocity.

==Uses==

=== Trains ===
Electromagnetic propulsion is utilized in transportation systems to minimize friction and maximize speed over long distances. This has mainly been implemented in high-speed rail systems that use a linear induction motor to power trains by magnetic currents. It has also been utilized in theme parks to create high-speed roller coasters and water rides.

Maglev
 In a maglev train the primary coil assembly lies below the reaction plate. There is a 1–10 cm (0.39-3.93 inch) air gap between that eliminates friction, allowing for speeds up to 500 km/h (310 mph). An alternating electric current is supplied to the coils, which creates a change in polarity of the magnetic field. This pulls the train forward from the front, and thrusts the train forward from the back.

A typical Maglev train costs three cents per passenger mile, or seven cents per ton mile (not including construction costs). This compares to 15 cents per passenger miles for travel by plane and 30 cents for ton mile for travel by intercity trucks. Maglev tracks have high longevity due to minimal friction and an even distribution of weight. Most last for at least 50 years and require little maintenance during this time. Maglev trains are promoted for their energy efficiency since they run on electricity, which can be produced by coal, nuclear, hydro, fusion, wind or solar power without requiring oil. On average most trains travel 483 km/h (300 mph) and use 0.4 megajoules per passenger mile. Using a 20 mi/gallon car with 1.8 people as a comparison, travel by car is typically 97 km/h (60 mph) and uses 4 megajoules per passenger mile. The carbon dioxide emissions are based upon the method of electrical production and fuel use. Many renewable electrical production methods generate little or no carbon dioxide during production (although carbon dioxide may be released during manufacture of the components, e.g. the steel used in wind turbines). The running of the train is significantly quieter than other trains, trucks or airplanes.
Assembly: Linear Induction Motor
A linear induction motor consists of two parts: the primary coil assembly and the reaction plate. The primary coil assembly consists of phase windings surrounded by steel laminations, and includes a thermal sensor within a thermal epoxy. The reaction plate consists of a 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) thick aluminum or copper plate bonded to a 6.4 mm (0.25 inch) thick cold rolled steel sheet. There is an air gap between these two parts that creates the frictionless property an electromagnetic propulsion system encompasses. Functioning of a linear induction motor begins with an AC force that is supplied to the coil windings within the primary coil assembly. This creates a traveling magnetic field that induces a current in the reaction plate, which then creates its own magnetic field. The magnetic fields in the primary coil assembly and reaction plate alternate, which generates force and direct linear motion.

=== Spacecraft ===
There are multiple applications for EMP technologies in the field of aerospace. Many of these applications are conceptual as of now, however, there are also several applications that range from near term to next century. One of such applications is the use of EMP to control fine adjustments of orbiting satellites. One of these particular systems is based on the direct interactions of the vehicle&#x27;s own electromagnetic field and the magnetic field of the Earth. The thrust force may be thought of as an electrodynamic force of interaction of the electric current inside its conductors with the applied natural field of the Earth. To attain a greater force of interaction, the magnetic field must be propagated further from the flight craft. The advantages of such systems is the very precise and instantaneous control over the thrust force. In addition, the expected electrical efficiencies are far greater than those of current chemical rockets that attain propulsion through the intermediate use of heat; this results in low efficiencies and large amounts of gaseous pollutants. The electrical energy in the coil of the EMP system is translated to potential and kinetic energy through direct energy conversion. This results in the system having the same high efficiencies as other electrical machines while excluding the ejection of any substance into the environment.

The current thrust-to mass ratios of these systems are relatively low. Nevertheless, since they do not require reaction mass, the vehicle mass is constant. Also, the thrust can be continuous with relatively low electric consumption. The biggest limitation would be mainly the electrical conductance of materials to produce the necessary values of the current in the propulsion system.

=== Ships and Submarines ===

EMP and its applications for seagoing ships and submarines have been investigated since at least 1958 when Warren Rice filed a patent describing the technology. The technology described by Rice considered charging the hull of the vessel itself. The design was later refined by allowing the water to flow through thrusters as described in a later patent by James Meng. The arrangement consists of a water channel open at both ends extending longitudinally through or attached to the ship, a means for producing magnetic field throughout the water channel, electrodes at each side of the channel and source of power to send direct current through the channel at right angles to magnetic flux in accordance with Lorentz force.

===Elevators===
Cable-free elevators using EMP, capable of moving both vertically and horizontally, have been developed by German engineering firm Thyssen Krupp for use in high rise, high density buildings.

<text>Christian Poncelet (; 24 March 192811 September 2020) was a conservative French politician. A member of President Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), he was President of the Senate from 1998 to 2008. In addition to being a Senator, he was Mayor of Remiremont (Vosges) and was also the President of the General Council of Vosges.

==Political career==
He was elected to the National Assembly in the November 1962 parliamentary election from the Third Constituency of Vosges and was re-elected from the same constituency in the March 1967 parliamentary election and the June 1968 parliamentary election. He served as a deputy until August 1972, when he vacated his seat following his nomination as a member of the government. He was first elected to the Senate in September 1977, and he was re-elected in September 1986, September 1995, and September 2004, representing Vosges.

On 2 October 1998, Poncelet was elected by the Senate as its President in a third round of voting. The previous President of the Senate, René Monory, had withdrawn after the first round of voting. In the third round, Poncelet received 189 votes against 93 for Socialist candidate Claude Estier and one vote for the withdrawn Communist candidate Hélène Luc.

In 2000, Poncelet was awarded the Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit.

Following the September 2008 Senate election, it was announced on 24 September that Poncelet would not seek another term as President of the Senate, although he would continue to serve as a Senator. He was succeeded by Gérard Larcher, also from the UMP, on 1 October.

==Personal life==
Poncelet was born in Blaise (now part of Vouziers) in the Ardennes. 

Poncelet died in Remiremont, on 11 September 2020, at the age of 92.

<text>The orange-billed babbler (Argya rufescens), also known as Ceylon rufous babbler or Sri Lankan rufous babbler, is a member of the family Leiothrichidae.

The orange-billed babbler is a resident breeding bird endemic to Sri Lanka. In the past, it was considered to be a race of jungle babbler, &quot;Argya striata&quot;.

Its habitat is rainforest, and it is seldom seen away from deep jungle. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight.

Although its habitat is under threat, it occurs in all the forests of the wet zone, and is quite common at prime sites like Kitulgala and Sinharaja. It builds its nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three deep greenish blue eggs.

These birds are plain orange brown below, and have a slightly darker shade above. The crown and nape are grey, and the bill is orange.

The orange-billed babbler lives in flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. It is usually the first sign that a mixed-species feeding flock, so characteristic of Asian wet forests, is in the vicinity. It feeds mainly on insects, but also eats jungle berries.

==Taxonomy==
The orange-billed babbler was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Turdoides&quot; but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Argya&quot;.

==In culture==
In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;rathu demalichcha&quot; (translates to &#x27;red babbler&#x27;) in Sinhala language.
This bird appears on a 10 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp.
Also this bird appears on the 100 Sri Lankan rupee bank note (2010 series).

<doc id="626207" wikidata="Q280376" url="?curid=626207" title="Rolando Blackman">
<text>Rolando Antonio Blackman (born February 26, 1959) is a Panamanian-American former professional basketball player. He was a four-time NBA All-Star who spent most of his career with the Dallas Mavericks. He holds the Mavericks&#x27; franchise single-game record for free throws made (22).

Blackman was born in Panama City, Panama, and raised in Brooklyn, New York, from the age of eight.

==Playing career==

===College basketball===
After being raised in Brooklyn, Blackman attended Kansas State University where he played basketball under coach Jack Hartman. At Kansas State, Blackman had a number of noteworthy achievements:
*In 1980, he was named the Big Eight Conference Player of the Year and All-American.
*He was a three-time unanimous All-Big Eight selection.
*He was three times named the Big Eight Defensive Player of the Year.
*He scored 1,844 career points, the second-highest total in Kansas State history.
*He had a career .517 Field Goal Percentage and a .717 Free Throw Percentage.

Prior to his senior season, Blackman also was selected as a starter for the 1980 Summer Olympics basketball team, but did not participate in the Olympics because of the U.S. Olympic boycott. He did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes.

In his senior year Blackman led Kansas State into the West Regional of the NCAA tournament as the #8 seed. They defeated #9 seed University of San Francisco in the first round. Then KSU pulled an iconic upset of #1 seed Oregon State, 50–48, in the second round, punctuated by Blackman&#x27;s game-winning jumper with three seconds left in the game. Next up was #4 seed Illinois, whom they defeated 57–52 in the semi before losing to #2 seed North Carolina 82–68 in the West Regional final.

In 1996, after the Big Eight Conference expanded to the Big 12, Blackman was named to the AP all-time All-Big Eight basketball team. Blackman&#x27;s number 25 jersey was retired by Kansas State February 17, 2007 in a ceremony at halftime during a game against Iowa State. In 2015, he was inducted into National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame.

== Professional career ==

===Dallas Mavericks (1981–1992)===
Rolando Blackman was drafted by the Mavericks in the first round (9th overall) of the 1981 NBA draft. He became the first Panamanian-born player in the NBA. Blackman had an immediate impact on the team, averaging 13.3 PPG in his rookie season. He was given a good amount of minutes in his career, getting around 24 minutes per game in his rookie campaign. He played well but the Mavericks weren&#x27;t good until the 1983–1984 season. That was also Blackman&#x27;s best statistical season as he averaged a career high 22.4 PPG and lead the franchise to its first ever playoff appearance. The Mavericks managed to beat the Seattle SuperSonics and reach the second round before ultimately losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. On February 17, 1986, Blackman set the Mavericks single-game record for free throws made and attempted in a 22–23 performance. Despite putting up amazing stats, Blackman missed the all star game that year, although he did make it the following year. He would go on to be named an NBA All-Star four times in his career. At the 1987 All-Star Game, Blackman tied the game at the end of regulation with two free throws. The West team would go on to win in overtime. As for the Mavericks, they played well and even had a magical season in 1987–1988 where they managed to reach the Western Conference Finals. This appearance happened to be the franchise&#x27;s first Conference Finals appearance in its history. The Mavericks made it far but fell to the Los Angeles Lakers in 7 games. After this series the Mavericks began to decline and wouldn&#x27;t achieve the same amount of success until much later on in the Dirk Nowitzki era. Blackman continued to play well and averaged around 19 PPG for the next few seasons, however the Mavericks fell off in the standings. By the 1991–1992 season, Blackman was 32 years old and the Mavericks entered a stage of rebuilding. By the 1992 off-season Blackman&#x27;s time with the team was finished. Blackman made 6,487 field goals with the Mavericks and scored 16,643 points, which was a franchise record for 18 years – until broken by Dirk Nowitzki on March 8, 2008. In his 865 games with the Mavericks, Blackman never fouled out of a game.

=== New York Knicks (1992–1994) ===
On June 24, 1992, Blackman was traded to the New York Knicks for a 1995 first-round pick (which became Loren Meyer). Blackman spent his final two seasons in the NBA with the New York Knicks. In his last season in New York, he was reunited with former Dallas teammate Derek Harper. The team made it to the NBA Finals where they lost to the Houston Rockets in seven games. One of Blackman&#x27;s most notable games as a Knick was when he hit the game winning shot in Game 4 of the 1993 Eastern Conference Semi-finals against the Charlotte Hornets, hitting a jump shot with five seconds left in the game that put the Knicks up by two. Blackman still played well in the twilight years of his career, but his age was finally getting to him and his time in the NBA was over. On July 6, 1994, the Knicks waived Blackman.

=== Retirement from the NBA ===
Shortly after being released, he retired from the league. Following the 1993–94 season, he had career totals of 17,623 points, 3,278 rebounds and 2,981 assists. Blackman was NBA&#x27;s all-time scoring leader among Hispanic/Latin players (born in Iberian, Latin American &amp; Spanish-speaking countries) until March 6, 2015, when Pau Gasol overtook him. Blackman&#x27;s number 22 jersey was retired by the Mavericks on March 11, 2000.

===Europe===
Blackman signed with the Greek League team AEK Athens BC in the middle of the 1994–95 season. Coached by Vlade Đurović, they finished the season in a disappointing eight place.

Over the summer of 1995, Blackman moved to Olimpia Milano, where he was brought in by head coach Bogdan Tanjević. Playing in the Italian League on a team including Dejan Bodiroga, Gregor Fučka, Nando Gentile, and Alessandro De Pol, Blackman, who turned 37 during the season, helped them win both the Italian League title and the Italian Basketball Cup by averaging 15.3 points per game. Blackman was named MVP of the Italian Cup series. Olimpia also reached the Korać Cup final, losing to Efes Pilsen Istanbul in the home-and-away series.

Blackman transferred to Limoges CSP in the summer of 1996, essentially brought along by coach Tanjević who earlier signed to be the club&#x27;s new head coach.

==Post-playing career==
In 2000, Blackman was tapped to be the defensive coordinator for the Mavericks under coach Don Nelson. The next year, he served as an assistant coach for the German National team and helped lead them to a bronze medal at the 2002 World Basketball Championships in Indianapolis. During the 2004–05 season, Blackman was hired as one of the Mavericks television analysts, along with Matt Pinto and Bob Ortegel. For the 2005–06 season, Blackman returned to the Mavericks&#x27; bench, serving his first season as a full-fledged assistant coach. In July 2006 he was promoted to the position of Director of Player Development.

In August 2010, Blackman was hired as an assistant coach for the Turkey national basketball team by head coach Bogdan Tanjević, in advance of the 2010 FIBA World Championship tournament. Blackman stated that he took the job specifically to work again with Tanjević, who had been his coach in Milan.

During the 2006 NBA Finals, Blackman&#x27;s former coach with the New York Knicks, Pat Riley, admitted, publicly for the first time, that sitting Rolando Blackman in favor of John Starks during Games 6 and 7 of the 1994 NBA Finals was the biggest coaching mistake in his career, and that he has never forgiven himself for it.

==Personal life==
He has four children and resides in Dallas, Texas.

Blackman is on the board of directors of the Assist Youth Foundation. The foundation&#x27;s goal is to advance opportunities for underprivileged kids in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex and across the globe.

Blackman is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. Blackman continues to contribute to his chapter, Beta Psi, as well as the Kansas State University community.

<text>&quot;Stalin Wasn&#x27;t Stallin&#x27; (A Modern Spiritual)&quot; was a song written in 1943 by Willie Johnson and originally recorded by the a cappella gospel group the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet (of which Johnson was a member) in 1943. Robert Wyatt recorded a cover of the song in 1980.

==Background==
&quot;Stalin Wasn&#x27;t Stallin was written during World War II, and praises the efforts of Joseph Stalin in his stand against Adolf Hitler&#x27;s invasion of the Soviet Union. United States president Franklin D. Roosevelt had declared in a 28 July 1943 speech that:

The United States and the Soviet Union were co-belligerents during the war and many decisive battles occurred between the Soviets and Germany that changed the direction of the war.

==Original recording==
The Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet spoke (or sermonized) the lyrics of the song against a rhythm of back-up vocals. It was a moderate hit in 1943. It has since appeared on several compilation records, including &quot;Gospel Greats: 60 Legendary Performances&quot; (The Soho Collection, 2005).

==Covers==
Robert Wyatt covered the song in 1980, emulating an a cappella group by singing in four-part harmony (achieved by multi-tracking). Wyatt&#x27;s interest in the song was that he wanted to remind the West of the selective memory they had during the Cold War about this earlier alliance. The cover was released as a single in 1981 with &quot;Stalingrad&quot;, a poem about the Battle of Stalingrad, written and read by Peter Blackman, on the &quot;B&quot; side. &quot;Stalin Wasn&#x27;t Stallin and &quot;Stalingrad&quot; also appeared on Wyatt&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;Nothing Can Stop Us&quot;. Wyatt had heard Blackman recite the poem in 1979 to an enthusiastic audience that apart from Wyatt, also included Jack Dash, a famous communist trade unionist and leader of many British dock workers. When Blackman was finished, Wyatt convinced him to record it and this was the recording that ended up in the single and album.

<text>Andonis Michaelides (Greek: Αντώνης Μιχαηλίδης; 24 July 1958 – 4 January 2011), better known as Mick Karn, was a British-Cypriot musician and songwriter who rose to fame as the bassist for the art rock/new wave band Japan. His distinctive fretless bass guitar sound and melodic playing style were a trademark of the band&#x27;s sound.

==Early life==
Karn was born Andonis Michaelides in Nicosia on 24 July 1958. When he was three, his Greek Cypriot parents moved with him to London, where he grew up. In his youth, he began playing mouth organ at the age of seven and violin at the age of eleven, before he took up playing bassoon for the school orchestra. As a bassoon player he performed with the London Schools Symphony Orchestra in a concert in October 1972 which was broadcast by Radio 4. However, when his bassoon was stolen and his school refused to buy him a new one, he bought a bass guitar for £5 from a school friend. At school he became friends with David Sylvian and his younger brother Steve. As an escape from their south London environment, they began to play music together, and in June 1974 they made their first public performance.

==Career==
===Japan===

Initially with Karn as lead vocalist, their band christened themselves Japan in 1974. Joined by keyboardist Richard Barbieri and guitarist Rob Dean the following year, they signed a recording contract with German disco label Hansa in 1977, with which they recorded three studio albums and became an alternative glam rock outfit in the mould of David Bowie, T.Rex, and The New York Dolls. They switched to Virgin Records to record their subsequent albums &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot; and &quot;Tin Drum&quot;.

As the band started to achieve commercial success with the release of &quot;Tin Drum&quot; and specifically the single &quot;Ghosts&quot;, which reached the top five in 1982, tensions and personality conflicts between band members arose. &quot;Tin Drum&quot; was to be the band&#x27;s final studio album. Long-simmering differences among the band members came to a head when Karn&#x27;s girlfriend, photographer Yuka Fujii, moved in with Sylvian, and the individual members forged ahead with their own projects. Karn said in an interview that as tensions with their record company had abated following Japan&#x27;s commercial success, band members began focusing on personal differences rather than on the common enemy.

===Session work and solo projects===
Karn played bass guitar and saxophone on Gary Numan&#x27;s 1981 No.6 hit &quot;She&#x27;s Got Claws&quot; and other tracks on its parent No.3 hit album, &quot;Dance&quot;. In November 1982, Karn released his first solo album, &quot;Titles&quot;, just as Japan had announced their split. In 1982, Karn wrote some material with Michael Finbarr Murphy, guitarist and writer for Heatwave, Alan Murphy of Level 42, and Diana Ross, among others. They played some low-key gigs around London during the summer of 1982, and then went their separate ways. That same year, Karn appeared on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; along with Angie Bowie, former wife of David Bowie. In 1982 he also contributed saxophone playing on three tracks on the Swedish band Lustans Lakejer&#x27;s album &quot;En plats i solen&quot;, produced by Richard Barbieri. Although Karn submitted an album&#x27;s worth of demos to Virgin Records as a more pop-oriented follow-up to his debut solo album &quot;Titles&quot;, the record label declined to fund the record and it was abandoned. In 1983, he collaborated with Midge Ure on the UK top 40 single &quot;After a Fashion&quot;, and in 1984, he formed Dalis Car with Peter Murphy. The duo released one album, &quot;The Waking Hour&quot;, in late 1984.

Karn also contributed to recordings by other artists, playing bass guitar on Bill Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Chimera&quot; mini-LP as well as &quot;Heads We’re Dancing&quot; from Kate Bush’s &quot;The Sensual World&quot; and with Joan Armatrading.

In the 1990s, he worked with artist David Torn, Andy Rinehart and a number of Japanese musicians, and formed the multinational new wave band, NiNa. Later on, he worked as a solo artist. He played at least one concert with Pete Townshend that featured an all-star line-up, including Phil Collins and Midge Ure.

Also in the 1990s, he started the Medium Productions label along with Steve Jansen and Richard Barbieri, two of his former fellow Japan members, and Debi Zornes (label management and artist co-ordination). In 2006, the MK Music imprint was established by Karn, Zornes and Mike Trenery; and beginning with 2006&#x27;s &quot;Three Part Species&quot;, all releases, including an autobiography, have the MK Music logo on them.

In 2001, Karn began to work with Gota Yashiki, Vivian Hsu, Masahide Sakuma, and Masami Tsuchiya in the band The d.e.p., or doggy eels project. That same year he worked with Paul Wong on his &quot;Yellow Paul Wong&quot; release. Karn left London in 2004 to live in Cyprus with his wife and son, financially enabling himself to keep working as a musician/artist. In 2009, Karn also released his autobiography, entitled &quot;Japan &amp; Self Existence&quot;, available through his website and Lulu. This details his music career, his interest in sculpture and painting, his childhood, relationships and family.

On 30 August 2010, Peter Murphy disclosed via a video message (subsequently removed/hidden) on his personal Facebook profile that he would be reuniting with Karn for a week in London, perhaps in November, to begin writing and recording for a second Dalis Car album. Murphy also added that this would be the first time the two had seen each other since 1983. The project was cut short, however, as Karn had recently been diagnosed with cancer. After his death, five of the tracks they did record were released on 5 April 2012 as an EP entitled &quot;InGladAloneness&quot;. The tracks were mixed by Steve Jansen and mastered by Pieter Snapper in Istanbul, while the artwork for the EP was created by Thomas Bak with a painting by Jarosław Kukowski.

==Musical style==
Karn was essentially a self-taught musician, stating, &quot;I rely very much on my ears. If it sounds as if it&#x27;s the right thing, then I&#x27;ll keep it—even if it may not be.&quot; His first musical instrument was bassoon, with which he attended and passed an LSSO audition. After his bassoon was stolen from him, he purchased a bass guitar for £5. It was then he joined up with David Batt (Sylvian), who played acoustic guitar.

Although Karn was principally Japan&#x27;s bassist, he also played all the wind instruments, including the saxophone; on &quot;Tin Drum&quot;, he played the Chinese suona (credited as &quot;dida&quot;) for the authentic oriental sound. Karn&#x27;s use of the fretless bass guitar, a relatively unusual instrument in modern popular music, produces a distinctive sound and playing style, which makes his playing immediately recognisable.

Karn played an aluminium-neck Travis Bean bass on all Japan albums up to &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot;. In 1981, he moved on to Wal basses, purchasing two Mark I instruments, one with rare African tulipwood facings, the other a cherry solid-body. Karn recorded Japan&#x27;s last studio album &quot;Tin Drum&quot; with the Wal and had continued to use these, along with a headless Klein K Bass.

==Sculpture and painting==
Karn was a self-taught sculptor working mainly in clay, although he explored other media. He held several exhibitions. He also painted in oils and experimented with use of ceramic on the canvas to create a 3D effect. He was photographed in the early 1980s by Steve Jansen. Several of his paintings were used as sleeve covers for his music including, &quot;Buoy&quot; and &quot;The Concrete Twin&quot;. His sculpture &quot;Mask of Confidence&quot;, combining his hands with the arms, upper torso and face of photographer Yuka Fujii, was used as the inner sleeve cover for Kajagoogoo&#x27;s &quot;Islands&quot; album. Karn, influenced by Chinese edible folk sculpture dating back thousands of years, also experimented in designing and creating edible life size portraiture, some of which were displayed at his restaurant &quot;The Penguin Cafe&quot;. Karn said, &quot;There was a definite change in style when I stopped using self-hardening clay in the mid-80s and began sculpting with more conventional clay. Finding it much more malleable, the pieces could be worked on a larger scale and needn&#x27;t be focused, as was the case previously, on small detail.&quot; He continued to sculpt throughout his life and eventually learnt to fire his own pieces.

==Personal life==
Karn had two diplomas in psychotherapy from a West London college, entitling him to call himself &quot;Member of the Associated Stress Consultants, Psychotherapy, and Regression &amp; Hypno-analysis&quot;.

==Illness and death==
In June 2010, Karn announced on his website that he had been diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, although the specific type of cancer was not mentioned. Although singer Peter Murphy said during an interview that Karn was suffering terminal brain cancer, this has not been confirmed. According to David Torn, Karn&#x27;s cancer had already metastasised, and he was undergoing chemotherapy. The website announcement stated that Karn had been struggling financially for some time and appealed for donations to help pay for his medical care and provide financial assistance for his family. Moreover, several people Karn had worked with, in particular Midge Ure, Porcupine Tree, and Masami Tsuchiya, announced concerts in support of the appeal. According to a website update, dated 3 September 2010, the funds raised by the appeal enabled Karn and his family to move back to London, where Karn received treatment. However, the cancer had spread beyond the possibility of treatment, and he died at his home in London on 4 January 2011.

<text>Lincoln Square on the North Side of Chicago, Illinois, is one of the city&#x27;s 77 community areas. It encompasses the smaller neighborhoods of Ravenswood, Ravenswood Gardens, Bowmanville, Budlong Woods, as well as Lincoln Square itself.

==Profile==


In the 1840s, farming was begun in this area by newly arrived English and German Americans. Two brothers, Lyman and Joseph Budlong arrived in 1857 to start a commercial pickling operation near what is today Lincoln Avenue and Berwyn. They later opened a commercial green house and flower fields to provide flowers for the then new Rosehill Cemetery. In 1925, to honor Abraham Lincoln, the Chicago City Council named the area Lincoln Square, and a prominent statue of the namesake was erected in 1956.

About 41,000 people live in the neighborhood along with over 1,000 small and medium-sized businesses. It is accessible through the Brown Line of the &#x27;L&#x27;. The neighborhood is bounded by Bryn Mawr and Peterson Avenues on the north, Montrose Avenue on the south, Ravenswood Avenue on the east and the Chicago River on the west. Its housing stock consists of private residences and small apartment buildings.

The commercial heart of Lincoln Square is located at the intersection of Lawrence, Western and Lincoln Avenues. Lincoln Avenue southeast of this intersection is home to a wide variety of restaurants and shops. Lincoln Square is historically known as a heavily German influenced and populated neighborhood, but now one is just as likely to see shops catering to the Thai culture. Still, the neighborhood is home to a number of German businesses, including Merz Apothecary and Lutz Café &amp; Bakery, and is the home of the Chicago branches of DANK (the German American National Congress) and the Niedersachsen Club. The German-language weekly newspaper was born in Lincoln Square in 1972, though its original headquarters above the Brauhaus is now only a bureau.

Events such as festivals and live musical performances are frequently held in Lincoln Square. The Apple Fest is a longstanding tradition in Lincoln Square that brings the community together to celebrate the beginning of fall. Dozens of vendors participate in the event each year selling autumn-themed crafts and apple-themed treats, such as fresh baked apple pies, bushels of apples, hot apple cider and apple pizza. The Square Roots Festival, which is held every summer, celebrates Lincoln Square&#x27;s history in music and German culture with live performances from local musicians and craft beer from local breweries.

== Politics ==
Lincoln Square is a stronghold for the Democratic Party in elections. In 2020, Joe Biden won 18,908 votes, or 85.8% compared to 2,699 for Donald Trump, or 12.2% In the 2016 presidential election, Lincoln Square cast 15,317 votes for Hillary Clinton (83.3%) and cast 1,981 votes Donald Trump (10.3%). In the 2012 presidential election, Lincoln Square cast 13,515 votes for Barack Obama and 2,435 votes for Mitt Romney. In the Illinois General Assembly, the entirety of Lincoln Square is located in the 7th Legislative District and the 13th House District. During the 101st General Assembly, the community area is represented by Senator Heather Steans and House Majority Leader Greg Harris. The Lincoln Square neighborhood encompasses the 40th and 47th wards on the Chicago City Council. The aldermen are Andre Vasquez in the 40th Ward and Matt Martin in the 47th Ward. Both were first elected in the 2019 election.

===Parks===
Lincoln Square contains several parks, which are maintained by the Chicago Park District.
* Winnemac Park covers more than 40 acres at the corner of Damen and Foster. The park contains the campuses of Amundsen High School, Chappell Elementary, and the Jorndt Field athletic complex. The park features natural prairie plants, multiple baseball fields, a soccer field, and a playground. The high school also includes a swimming pool, run by the Chicago Park District, that is open to the public during limited times.
* Welles Park covers 15 acres and sits at the corner of Lincoln and Montrose Avenues, across from the Conrad Sulzer Regional Library. It contains a community center, including a pool, gym, and fitness center. A gazebo stands at the center of the park where concerts are held during the summer. The playground in the northwest corner has swings, climbing equipment and a small splash-pad. There are also several baseball fields, tennis courts and courts to play horseshoes. The park recently won a grant to install a nature area in the southwest corner of the park. 
* Jacob Park is a small playlot located at Virginia and Leland Avenues, right next to the Chicago River. It features a large sandbox, which neighbors have stocked with trucks and toys. The Chicago &quot;L&quot; runs along the southern edge of the park, to the delight of children and adults.
* River Park is located along the Chicago River, south of Foster Ave. and west of Francisco Ave. The park includes a community center, an outdoor pool, and a popular splash pad. The park is also the start of the North Shore Channel Trail, which continues 6.7 miles through the Skokie Northshore Sculpture Park and up to Evanston&#x27;s Ladd Arboretum.
* Vogle Playlot is tucked in the corner of Lawrence and Hoyne Avenues. It contains a newly renovated playground and swing-set.

<text>Disk Operating System/360, also DOS/360, or simply DOS, is the discontinued first member of a sequence of operating systems for IBM System/360, System/370 and later mainframes. It was announced by IBM on the last day of 1964, and it was first delivered in June 1966. In its time, DOS/360 was the most widely used operating system in the world.

==DOS versions==

===BOS/360===

The Basic Operating System (BOS) was an early version of DOS and TOS which could provide usable functionality on a system with as little as 8 KB of main storage and one 2311 disk drive.

===TOS/360===
TOS/360 (Tape Operating System/360, not a DOS as such and not so called) was an IBM operating system for the System/360, used in the early days around 1965 to support the System/360 Model 30 and similar platforms.

TOS, as per the &quot;Tape&quot; in the name, required a tape drive. It shared most of the code base and some manuals with IBM&#x27;s DOS/360.

TOS went through 14 releases, and was discontinued when disks such as the IBM 2311 and IBM 2314 became more affordable at the time of System/360, whereas they had been an expensive luxury on the IBM 7090.

===DOS/360===
DOS/360 was the primary operating system for most small to midsize S/360 installations.

===DOS/VS===
DOS/VS was released in 1972. The first DOS/VS release was numbered &quot;Release 28&quot; to signify an incremental upgrade from DOS/360. It added virtual memory in support of the new System/370 series hardware. It used a fixed page table which mapped a single address space of up to 16 megabytes for all partitions combined.

DOS/VS increased the number of partitions (separate simultaneous programs) from three (named Background, Foreground 1 and Foreground 2) to five (BG and F1 through F4) and allowed a system wide total of fifteen subtasks.

DOS/VS was succeeded by DOS/VSE through z/VSE.

===DOS/VSE===
DOS/VSE was introduced in 1979 as an &quot;extended&quot; version of DOS/VS to support the new 4300 processors.
The 4300 systems included a feature called ECPS:VSE that provided a single-level storage for both the processor and the I/O channels. DOS/VSE provided support for ECPS:VSE, but could also run on a System/370 without that feature. VSE was the last free version of DOS.

===VSE/AF===

VSE/Advanced Functions (VSE/AF), prepared for 1983 delivery, added new device support and functionality to DOS/VSE. Many installations ran VSE/AF using products such as VSE System Installation Productivity Option/Extended (VSE System IPO/E), which combined DOS/VSE, VSE/AF and various other products.

===SSX/VSE===

SSX/VSE (&quot;Small System Executive&quot;) was an attempt by IBM to simplify purchase and installation of VSE by providing a pre-generated system containing the OS and the most popular products. SSX was released in 1982, and later replaced by VSE/SP. SSX was sold by IBM as a bundle of 14 component products (Advanced Functions/VSE, VSE/POWER, ACF/VTAME, VSE/VSAM, CICS/DOS/VS, DOS/VS, Sort/Merge, VSE/ICCF, VSE/OCCF, VSE/IPCS, DOS/COBOL, Back Up/Restore, Space Management, VSE/DITTO), and originally would only agree to offer the individual products separately via RPQ, although IBM later agreed to add those products individually to its price list under pressure from ISVs who claimed that the bundling violated antitrust laws.

===VSE/SP===
In 1986 IBM released VSE/SP (&quot;System Product&quot;) in conjunction with the announcement of the 9370 processors. VSE/SP replaced SSX/VSE and bundled VSE with the most popular VSE program products such as VSE/AF, ACF/VTAM, CICS, and POWER/VS. VSE/SP supported only 24-bit addresses, despite customer requests to provide an XA (31 bit) version.

===VSE/ESA===
VSE/ESA was a 31-bit DOS/VSE version, which was released in 1990 with support for up to 384 MB of real storage. It provided up to twelve &quot;static partitions&quot; and allowed VSE/POWER and ACF/VTAM to be run in &quot;private address spaces&quot;. It introduced a new feature called &quot;dynamic partitions&quot; which could allow up to 150 concurrent jobs, each in its own address space. Version 1 could run in either ESA or 370 mode, with the ESA mode also supporting XA hardware with limitations. Version 2 (1995) only supported ESA mode with ESA hardware. Version 2 added support for multiprocessing, through the new &quot;Turbo Dispatcher&quot;, which permits different partitions to execute simultaneously on different processors. A partition can only run on one processor at a time, which mostly limits the multiprocessing to multitasking. Up to ten processors are theoretically supported (&quot;tolerated&quot;), but up to four are effectively utilized. Those limits remain in the last z/VSE.

===z/VSE===

IBM released z/VSE 3.1 in 2005. This change in naming reflected the new &quot;System z&quot; branding for IBM&#x27;s mainframe product line, but did not represent a fundamental change in architecture from VSE/ESA 2.7 which preceded it. In particular, it did not support the new 64-bit z/Architecture, running only in 31-bit mode even on 64-bit capable machines. z/VSE 4.1 released in 2007 introduced support for 64-bit real addressing, with up to 8 GB of memory. However, while parts of the supervisor run in 64-bit mode, it only provides 31-bit virtual address spaces to problem state applications. As of 2011 one estimate placed the number of sites using z/VSE at around 4,000.

==History ==
When developing a new hardware generation of unified System/360 (or S/360) computers, IBM had originally committed to delivering a single operating system, OS/360, also compatible with low-end machines; but hardware was already available and the OS/360 project fell further and further behind schedule, as described at length by Fred Brooks in The Mythical Man-Month. IBM was forced to quickly develop four additional systems: 
* BPS/360 for machines with at least 8 KB of core memory and a punched card reader,
* BOS/360 for machines with at least 8 KB memory and a disk drive,
* DOS/360 for machines with at least 16 KB memory and a disk drive,
* TOS/360 for machines with at least 16 KB memory and a tape drive.
When OS/360 was finally released, a year late, it required at least 64 KB of memory. DOS was designed to use little memory, and could run on 16 KB machines, a configuration available on the low-end S/360 model 30. Unlike OS/360, DOS/360 was initially a single-job system which did not support multitasking. A version with multitasking, supporting up to three memory partitions, requiring 32 KB of memory was later released. Despite its limitations, DOS/360 became the most widely used operating system for processors with less than 256 KB of memory because: System/360 hardware sold very well; DOS/360 ran well on System/360 processors which medium-sized organizations could afford; and it was better than the &quot;operating systems&quot; these customers had before.

DOS/360 was the operating system which filled the time gap between the announcement of the System/360 and the availability of the intended operating system, OS/360. As a result of the delay, a number of customers implemented DOS systems and committed significant investments to run them. IBM expected that DOS/360 users would soon upgrade to OS/360, but as a result of those investments, they were reluctant to commit to such conversion. IBM then needed to continue to offer DOS/360 as an additional operating system. The Hacker&#x27;s Jargon File incorrectly states that GECOS (also known as GCOS) was copied from DOS/360, which was not the case, however the Xerox Data Systems Xerox Operating System (XOS) was intentionally similar to DOS to simplify program porting.

==Hardware requirements==

DOS/360 required a System/360 CPU (model 25 and above) with the standard instruction set (decimal and floating-point instruction sets optional). The minimum memory requirement was 16 KB; storage protection was required only if multiprogramming was used. A 1052 Model 7 printer-keyboard, either a selector or multiplexor channel, and at least one disk drive was required — initially a 2311 holding 7.25 MB. A card reader, card punch and line printer were usually included, but magnetic tape drives could be substituted.

A &quot;typical&quot; configuration might consist of a S/360 model 30 with 32KB memory and the decimal instruction set, an IBM 2540 card reader/card punch, an IBM 1403 printer, two or three IBM 2311 disks, two IBM 2415 magnetic tape drives, and the 1052-7 console.

==Technical details==
&quot;The following description applies to DOS/360 except as otherwise noted. Later versions offer additional functionality.&quot;

Because DOS/360 was designed to run on low-end models of System/360 memory usage was a concern. It was possible to generate a DOS &quot;supervisor&quot;, the resident portion of the operating system, as small as 5902 bytes. Detailed charts listed memory requirements for each sysgen option, often as little as 100 bytes. A minimum system would leave just over 10 KB of storage available for a single batch partition which was enough to run utilities and all compilers except COBOL, PL/I, and full FORTRAN IV. To keep memory usage as small as possible, DOS was coded entirely in assembly language.

===Transients===
The concept of transient area is part of Mythical Man-Month&#x27;s discussion on design and the use of main memory. To further reduce memory usage, the supervisor employed overlays called &quot;transients&quot; that were read into one of two reserved &quot;transient areas&quot; as required.
* Physical transients were loaded into the 556 byte A-Transient area to handle hardware errors (ERPs), record error-specific data (OBR/MDR) on IJSYSRC, and issue error messages. All A-Transient module names began with .
* Logical transients were loaded into the 1200 byte B-Transient area to provide common program services like OPEN and CLOSE for LIOCS. All B-Transient module names began with .

The use of and prefixes ensured rapid loading of transients because their names were stored first in the directory.

DOS/VS added Machine Check and Channel Check Handlers, which were another set of transients all starting with and executing in the Recovery Transient area. This was done as part of the reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) enhancements for the System/370. Before this addition, machine checks caused termination of the program running and channel checks caused termination of the program accessing the device, at the time of the error.

===Multiprogramming===
Like OS/360, initial releases of DOS could run only one program at a time. Later versions of &quot;real&quot; DOS were able to run up to three programs concurrently, in separate memory partitions, supported by the same hardware memory protection features of the more scalable OS/360 operating system. These were identified as BG (&quot;background&quot;), F1 (&quot;foreground 1&quot;) and F2 (&quot;foreground 2&quot;). Multiprogramming was an optional feature of DOS/360, selectable at system generation. A later SYSGEN option allowed batch operation run in either FG partition. Otherwise foreground programs had to be manually started by the computer operator.

DOS/VS allowed up to seven concurrent programs, although five or six was a more common number due to the smaller scale of the hardware usually hosting DOS systems. Both DOS and DOS/VS allow the number of partitions to be set at IPL (Initial Program Load), the IBM term for Boot load.

===Program libraries===
Executable programs were stored in a &quot;Core Image Library&quot;. While running, DOS could not reclaim space as programs were deleted or replaced with newer versions. When the Core Image Library became full, it had to be compressed by a utility program, and this could halt development work until it was complete. Many shops simply froze changes for a day, compressed the CIL &quot;off-line&quot;, and IPLed with the new Core Image Library at the beginning of a business day. A &quot;relocatable library&quot; for linkable object programs and a &quot;source statement library&quot; for assembler macros and include text were also supported. Installations could define additional &quot;private&quot; relocatable and source statement libraries on other disk volumes.

===Utilities===
DOS/360 had a set of utility programs, an Assembler, and compilers for FORTRAN, COBOL and eventually PL/I, and it supported a range of file organizations with access methods to help in using them:

* Sequential data sets were only read or written, one record block at a time from beginning to end.
* In indexed (ISAM) files a specified section of each record was defined as a key which could be used to look up specific records.
* In direct access (BDAM) files, the application program had to specify the physical location on the disk of the data it wanted to access. BDAM programming was not easy and most customers never used it themselves; but it was the fastest way to access data on disks and many software companies used it in their products, especially database management systems such as ADABAS, IDMS and IBM&#x27;s DBOMP and DL/I.
Sequential and ISAM files could store either fixed-length or variable-length records, and all types could occupy more than one disk volume.

===Telecommunications===
DOS/360 offered Basic Telecommunications Access Method (BTAM) and Queued Telecommunications Access Method (QTAM). BTAM was primitive and hard to use by later standards, but it allowed communication with almost any type of terminal, which was a big advantage at a time when there was little standardization of communications protocols. The simplicity of its API also allowed the relatively easy interface of external communications processors, which facilitated DOS/360 machines becoming nodes in the multi-tier networks of large organizations. Conversely, QTAM users did not need as much knowledge about individual devices because QTAM operated at the logical level using the OPEN/CLOSE/GET/PUT macros.

==Job control==

All DOS job control statements began with &quot;&quot; in card columns one and two except &quot;end-of-job&quot; which was &quot;&quot;, &quot;end-of-data&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;comments&quot;, &quot;&quot;. (&quot;In the description that follows the character &quot;&quot; represents a single blank&quot;.)
* The statement indicates &quot;the beginning of control information for a job.&quot; The format is // JOB &lt;jobname&gt; &lt;comments&gt;. must be one to eight alphanumeric characters to identify the job. are ignored.
* The statement identifies a program to be executed as a &quot;job step&quot;. &quot;All control statements necessary for execution must be processed&quot; before the statement is read. The format is // EXEC &lt;program&gt;
* The statement &quot;can be used to allow for operator action between job steps.&quot; The format is // PAUSE &lt;comment&gt;. The comment is used to provide a message to the operator.
* The statement may be used to display a message to the operator. The format is .
* The &quot;end of data&quot; statement marks the end of data in the input stream. The format is /*. Any data on the statement following the blank is ignored.
* The &quot;end of job&quot; statement marks the end of a job, and may indicate the end of data to be flushed if the job terminates abnormally. The format is /&amp;. Any data on the statement following the blank is ignored.
* The statement specifies values of system options that apply to this job. The format is // OPTION &lt;option1&gt;[,&lt;option2&gt;...].
* The statement &quot;is used to assign a logical I/O unit to a physical device.&quot; The format is // ASSGN SYSxxx,&lt;device&gt;[,&lt;tape option&gt;]. SYSxxx indicates a logical unit such as SYS001 or SYSIPT. is either &quot;X&#x27;cuu&#x27;&quot; to indicate a physical device (channel and unit), &quot;IGN&quot; for ignore, or &quot;UA&quot; for unassigned. specifies either tape mode settings such as density, parity, etc., or &quot;ALT&quot; to indicate an alternate device.
* The statement resets specified I/O unit assignments to their permanent values. The format is // RESET &lt;option&gt;. may be &quot;SYS&quot; to reset all system logical unit assignments, &quot;PROG&quot; to reset all programmer assignments, &quot;ALL&quot; to reset all assignments, or &quot;SYSxxx&quot; to reset the assignment for the logical unit &quot;SYSxxx&quot;, for example SYS002.
* The statement instructs the system to print a listing of all specified I/O assignments currently in effect. The format is // LISTIO &lt;option&gt;. is &quot;SYS&quot; to list all system assignments, &quot;PROG&quot;, &quot;F1&quot;, or &quot;F2&quot; to list all assignments for the background or specified foreground partition, &quot;ALL&quot;, &quot;SYSxxx&quot;, &quot;X&#x27;cuu&#x27;&quot;, &quot;UNITS&quot; to list all assigned units, &#x27;UA&quot; to list all unassigned units, or &quot;DOWN&quot; to list all units marked as inoperative.
* The statement issues command to a magnetic tape unit. The format is // MTC &lt;opcode&gt;,SYSxxx[,&lt;nn&gt;]. is a function such as &quot;FSF&quot; to forward space one file or &quot;REW&quot; to rewind the tape. is a number that can specify the number of times the operation is to be performed, such as forward space two files.
* The statement provides disk or tape volume label information for standard label checking. The format is // VOL SYSxxx,&lt;volume&gt;.
* DOS originally provided the statement for tape label information and the and statements for disk label and extent information. At least as early as 1968 the statement had been replaced by and the statement by . These statements used numerous positional parameters and had fairly high information densities.
==Differences from OS/360==

===Job control language===
DOS JCL was designed for parsing speed and simplicity; the resulting positional syntax was significantly more cryptic than OS/360 keyword-driven job control.

===Spooling===
Early DOS included no spooling sub-system to improve the efficiency of punched card and line printer I/O. By the late 1960s both IBM and aftermarket vendors began filling this void. IBM&#x27;s spooler was an option called Priority Output Writers, Execution processors and input Readers (POWER), and Software Design, Inc., an independent software company, sold a spooler called GRASP.

===Program loading===
DOS/360 had no relocating loader, so programmers had to link edit a separate executable version of each program for each partition, or address space, in which the program was likely to be run. Alternatively assembler-language programs could be written as self-relocating, but that imposed additional complexity and a size penalty, albeit a small one. Large DOS shops with multiple machines and multiple partition layouts often wrote their own relocating loader to circumvent this issue.

===Application programming interface===
The DOS/360 application programming interface was incompatible with OS/360. High level language programs written for DOS needed to be compiled and linked before they could be used with OS/360. Minor differences between compilers of DOS as opposed to OS sometimes required modifications to programs. The port in the other direction however was more challenging. Since OS/360 had significantly more features supported in its API, any use of those features would have to be removed from programs being ported to DOS. This was less of a problem for programmers working in high level languages such as COBOL. Assembler programs, on the other hand, tended to utilize those very features more often and usually needed greater modification to run on DOS.

<doc id="626232" wikidata="Q5634675" url="?curid=626232" title="HMS Trafalgar (D77)">
<text>HMS &quot;Trafalgar&quot; was a of the Royal Navy (RN). She was named after the Battle of Trafalgar, a decisive British victory over a Franco-Spanish Fleet in 1805. &quot;Trafalgar&quot; was built by Swan Hunter on the Tyne. She was launched on 12 January 1944 and commissioned on 23 July 1945.

==Royal Navy service==
In August 1945, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; commanded by Captain Anthony F Pugsley deployed to the Far East via the Mediterranean as part of the 19th Destroyer Flotilla, which consisted of her sister ships, and which performed a variety of duties in that region while based there. It was a brief stay however, for just the following year, the destroyer, along with the rest of the 19th Flotilla, returned to the UK via the Mediterranean. Upon returning home to the UK, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; was placed in reserve, an occurrence quite familiar to her sister ships during the 1950s. In 1953, while still in reserve, she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

In 1958, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; emerged from a refit, was commissioned and became the leader of the 7th Destroyer Squadron, having spells with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. Just prior to her return to the UK in 1961 she was accidentally rammed by her sister-ship , Captain(D) 1st Destroyer Squadron, thus delaying her return to the UK. In 1962, &quot;Trafalgar&quot; along with ships of the squadron, sailed for the Mediterranean for the last time, performing a number of naval exercises, as well as fly-the-flag visits.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Trafalgar&quot;, with the rest of the 7th Destroyer Squadron, finally returned to the UK in 1963 where she was decommissioned, and subsequently placed in Reserve at HMNB Portsmouth Dockyard. She was eventually broken up for scrap at Dalmuir arriving there on 8 June 1970.

<doc id="626242" wikidata="Q840381" url="?curid=626242" title="Flatbush">
<text>Flatbush is a neighborhood in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood consists of several subsections in central Brooklyn and is generally bounded by Prospect Park to the north, East Flatbush to the east, Midwood to the south, and Kensington and Parkville to the west. The modern neighborhood includes or borders several institutions of note, including Brooklyn College.

The area was home to the Canarsee people before contact with Europeans; many of the tribe&#x27;s paths would become important roads through the region. Flatbush was originally chartered as the Dutch Nieuw Nederland colony town of Midwout, also called Vlachte Bos. It was one of the six original European towns on Long Island. The town remained primarily Dutch and rural in character until the latter half of the 19th century, when increasing rail and road connectivity to other parts of New York made it an attractive suburb to Brooklyn and New York City. The town was consolidated into the City of Greater New York in 1898 and was further connected to the rest of the city with the development of the New York City Subway in the early 20th century. Post-World War II, the neighborhood underwent tremendous demographic shifts, becoming home to increasing numbers of immigrants from the Caribbean, Asia, and elsewhere. In the late 20th century and 21st century it has continued to see changes due to gentrification and new immigrants.

Flatbush is part of Brooklyn Community District 14. It is patrolled by the 67th and 70th Precincts of the New York City Police Department. Politically, Flatbush is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 40th and 45th Districts.

==History==

===Colonial period===
In the 16th century, western Long Island was inhabited by the Canarsee people, who called it Sewanhacka. The Canarsee and related Lenape tribes lived semi-nomadic lives, moving seasonally to follow food sources. Their crisscrossing trails through the area formed some of the early roads for the modern region. One of their primary settlements was located roughly at the current intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Kings Highway, named Keskachane or &quot;council fire&quot;.

Henry Hudson is reported to have landed on the island in 1609. Hudson was an Englishman working for the Dutch East India Company, and the Dutch established trading posts and settlements in their new colony of Nieuw Nederland thereafter, buying up land from the Canarsee (who did not share the Dutch&#x27;s view of property rights, viewing the sales not as final but essentially leases.) One of the Dutch settlements was Midwout (alternatively &quot;Midwoud&quot; or &quot;Medwoud&quot;,) Dutch for &quot;middle wood&quot;. Midwout was established inland, in a forested area bounded by hills to the north and flat open spaces to the south, which had been managed by the natives for cultivation and game purposes. The geography was created by the ancient glacier that once covered the area, leaving behind as it retreated the hills of the terminal moraine and a large outwash plain beyond. Midwout was settled between 1630 and 1636, and received a patent of township by 1652. In the following years it would also be known as Vlachte Bos or Flackebos (&quot;wooded plain&quot;), and the various names and spellings of the town were used interchangeably for nearly a century.

A church was built in 1654, replaced by another structure in 1698. The early settlement was enclosed by a palisade wall for protection. By 1658, it was the location of the courts and seat of Justice for the County. There were records of schoolmasters in the town from 1659. The north end of Midwout was called Steenraap, the main business center the Dorp, and the south end Rustenburgh or resting-place. Among the early colonists in Midwout who would rise to prominence was Leffert Pietersen Van Haughwout. Van Haughwout&#x27;s family, later known as the Lefferts, would build a homestead in the 1680s in the north of town, now part of Prospect Lefferts Gardens. Other Dutch families would ultimately lend their names to the streets of the modern city. In its early years, Midwout came into conflict with its neighboring town of New Amersfoort over its borders, as well as with the local natives; in 1670 the Rockaway Indians challenged the Dutch claims, saying the Canarsee had no authority to sell the land. Midwout&#x27;s leadership bought the land again to avoid trouble. By the end of the century most of the natives in the region were either dead by war or disease, or dispossessed of their ancestral lands; a few remained in Midwout as farmhands or servants for the Dutch.

In 1664, the English captured nearby New Amsterdam, and New Netherland was ceded to the English, remaining permanently in their hands after 1674 as New York. The towns of Long Island were united as Kings County in 1683. The borders of Midwout were fixed in 1685 in a new charter granted by Thomas Dongan, the English governor of New York province. The English &quot;Flatbush&quot; gradually supplanted the Dutch names for the town. The Dutch character of Flatbush remained despite the English takeover; Dutch landowners continued to exert political control, and Dutch remained the dominant language until the latter part of the 18th century. Marriage outside of Dutch social circles was discouraged, which helped retain Dutch culture and kept the inhabitants &quot;clannish&quot;, in the words of one historian.

Early Dutch settlement of the area had focused on farming, which proved lucrative as nearby New York City grew. The need for labor spurred the importation of African slaves, making New York one of the largest slaveholding regions in the northern English colonies. Dutch slavery was less rigid and repressive than that of the Southern Colonies, but as the English assumed control of the region, harsher legal codes came into effect. The slave population swelled through the 18th century. In 1738, 29% of Flatbush&#x27;s recorded population of 539 were slaves, jumping to 41% by 1790. The enslaved labor pool was also supplemented by indentured servants from the British Isles or Germany.

During the American Revolution (1775–1783), Flatbush demonstrated conflicting loyalties to either the loyalist or patriot causes. Patriot troops burned houses and farmland early in war to deny the British the resources. Landowners in Brooklyn were concerned that a full conflict between the Colonies and the British would result in loss of their critical source of slave labor. Parts of the Battle of Long Island took place in Flatbush; the patriots checked the British advance north at what is now known as Battle Pass, until they were surprised by a flanking attack. The town of Flatbush was occupied by the British for seven years, with British troops and American prisoners of war billeted in area homes. Some Flatbush residents maintained their loyalist sympathies: the King&#x27;s Arms, for example, appeared in the town&#x27;s inn for a half-century after the conclusion of the conflict.

For several decades after the Revolution, New York merchants and farmers continued to engage in the slave trade. The Gradual Emancipation Law of 1799 emancipated people of African descent born after July 4, 1799. Men and women escaping enslavement often went to Manhattan, where they could live within the community of free blacks. Slavery was fully abolished in 1827, though many former slaves continued to work as sharecroppers under their former owners.
===19th century===

Into the 19th century, Flatbush remained a slow-growing farming community. The opening of the Erie Canal shifted cultivation away from grains and towards market produce, with Kings County being the second-largest largest provider of produce in the country until the end of the century after Queens County. It remained isolated from the growing Brooklyn by open country. Prospect Park was developed from land partially in Flatbush, though it was wholly claimed by Brooklyn. The rural character of the town, however, would not last. In the second quarter of the century, a street grid was laid out, and the main north-south road was established as Flatbush Avenue. A stream of Irish and some German immigrants arrived in the area, comprising the majority of the rural labor force by 1860. Though Flatbush and Kings County did not support Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s presidency in 1860, after the American Civil War broke out, Flatbush residents raised funds and soldiers for the war effort. Blacks fleeing the violence of the New York City draft riots found refuge in Flatbush and nearby Weeksville.

Flatbush built a Town Hall in 1875, a few years after Flatbush and the other towns of Kings County avoided annexation by Brooklyn. The Brooklyn, Flatbush and Coney Island Railway, established 1878, connected Flatbush to the pleasure spots at Coney Island and the Atlantic Coast to the south, and downtown Brooklyn and Manhattan to the north. The railways and the opening of bridges connecting Brooklyn to Manhattan began transforming Flatbush into a suburb. Towards the end of the century, the land was worth more if used for real estate than farming, and large landowners began selling off plots. John Lefferts divided his family&#x27;s Flatbush homestead into 516 parcels, restricted by covenant to only be developed into single-family housing. These formed Lefferts Manor, containing possibly the neighborhood&#x27;s earliest row houses. Another early development was Vanderveer Park, formed from 65 acres of the Vanderveer family&#x27;s holdings. Like Lefferts Manor, Vanderveer Park traded on the Dutch history of the region to attract buyers. The developers of the new housing pitched Flatbush as a country oasis offering respite from the &quot;cliff-dwelling&quot; vertical living of Manhattan. Much of the development focused on the areas immediately south and east of Prospect Park, with the farther-flung areas remaining mostly rural and dotted with wood-framed houses.
Amid the construction of houses and the infrastructure to support them, Flatbush&#x27;s population tripled in the decades before 1900. In the face of increasing urbanization, some community leaders wished for Flatbush and the outlying Kings County towns to retain their rural character. Resident and amateur historian Gertrude Lefferts Vanderbilt, writing in 1881, correctly predicted a coming merger with Brooklyn, and lamented that the Dutch character of the town was gone. The only remaining signs of its presence to her were &quot;the reminiscences and traditions, while the old family names mark the localities still, as the projecting peaks mark the submerged rock.&quot;

In 1894, Flatbush was successfully annexed into Brooklyn. A reception hosting Brooklyn mayor Charles A. Schieren was held at the Midwood Club House, where Schieren called the former town &quot;the prettiest and most fascinating suburban village of Kings County.&quot; Brooklyn itself was merged into New York City in 1898, a move opposed by many in Brooklyn and passed by just 277 votes.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, Flatbush changed even more rapidly as further transit improvements spurred additional development. The course of the Brooklyn, Flatbush &amp; Coney Island Railroad (now called the Brooklyn &amp; Brighton Beach Railroad) was electrified in 1901 and run over the Brooklyn Bridge, connecting Flatbush more directly with lower Manhattan. This was followed by further improvements to the line in the subsequent years, including the addition of more tracks and removal of at-grade crossings. The railways lived alongside five trolley lines that ran to Williamsburg in north Brooklyn and the Lower East Side in Manhattan. Development of the north end of Flatbush was helped along with the construction of Ebbets Field, home of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team.

Construction across Brooklyn slowed as Europe and then America became embroiled in World War I; the cost of construction spiked, and the city emerged from the war years having gone from a surplus of housing a decade earlier to a dire shortage. The response from the government was a slew of housing and tenant bills, with one allowing the city to exempt new residential construction from property taxes until 1932. The ordinance spurred a housing boom across the borough, with significant development in the much cheaper land of southern Brooklyn and Flatbush, which was increasingly connected to the rest of the city via new infrastructure projects. Extant homes—including the neighborhood&#x27;s earliest suburban development—were converted to multifamily dwellings or demolished for new homes or apartments, which came in an array of architectural styles. Alongside the residential construction came commercial developments, from movie palaces like the Loew&#x27;s Kings Theatre to department stores like Sears Roebuck &amp; Company. An entertainment and commercial district developed in the vicinity of Church and Flatbush Avenues, with another developing at the intersection of Flatbush, Avenue H, and Nostrand Avenue, known as the Junction.

As six-story Art Deco and Colonial Revival elevator apartment houses alongside stylistically analogous walk-ups were developed on Ocean Avenue and throughout its periphery, Flatbush nurtured a socioeconomically diverse population of Irish Americans, Italian Americans and American Jews; according to anthropologist Ansley Hamid, occupants ranged from &quot;merchants [and] professionals&quot; to &quot;skilled [and] manual laborers.&quot; By 1930, one-third of Flatbush&#x27;s residents were Jewish. The new residents ultimately displaced the remaining Anglo-Dutch, who decamped to farther-off suburbs in Long Island or New Jersey.

By the Great Depression, Flatbush had a population of 400,000, and boasted fifteen theaters, rail and trolly lines, dozens of schools, fifty-four churches, and five newspapers. New York greatly benefited from New Deal policies and funds, which helped build Brooklyn College in 1935. During World War II the &quot;soldier from Flatbush&quot; became a symbol of the All-American soldier.

After the war, Flatbush saw demographic shifts along with the rest of the city. Owners and renters from the interwar years aged, and their children moved out of the neighborhood; from 1950 to 1960 children under six in Flatbush dropped 14 percent, while the number of seniors over 65 rose 42 percent. The Dodgers left Brooklyn, and Ebbets Field was torn down. In the 1960s, poorer African Americans and Puerto Ricans began moving into the corridor along Nostrand Avenue, where the subway offered access to job opportunities, while middle-class African Americans bought up row houses to the west. Blockbusting encouraged white residents to sell and leave the neighborhood, and properties fell into disrepair while crime increased. The population of the neighborhood shifted from 89% white in 1970 to 30% white in a decade. The white and Jewish residents were replaced by Hispanic, Asian, and black ones, and the commercial properties shifted to reflect the change. Afro-Caribbean immigrants joined African Americans in moving from traditional neighborhoods like Harlem to Flatbush, particularly Haitians fleeing the dictatorial rule of François and Jean-Claude Duvalier. One resident who moved to the area in 1971 recalled that his building gradually shed staff and maintenance was neglected as the decade wore on, amid a wider drop in city services following the city&#x27;s financial crisis.

Parts of the neighborhood in the west and to the south of Prospect Park continued to attract a sizable number of wealthier homeowners, and doctors still resided and practiced on a stretch of Parkside Avenue immediately adjacent to Prospect Park. By the mid-1980s, however, the neighborhood had numerous abandoned or semi-abandoned buildings, many of which had fallen into a state of disrepair. The eastern parts of Flatbush were particularly affected. Crime worsened significantly during the 1970s and 80s, alongside a rise in drugs. A number of stores on Flatbush and Church Avenues fell victim to looting during the 1977 blackout.

Tenants rights organizations and neighborhood associations formed to fight back against the neighborhood&#x27;s decay. The Flatbush Development Corporation, one of a number of community development corporations that formed in poorer areas of the country starting in the late 1960s, sought to revitalize the community. The FDC investigated bad landlords and agitated for loans to developers willing to refurbish old buildings. Other groups worked to protect threatened buildings and neighborhoods as historic landmarks. In the 1980s, families and young couples priced out of areas like Park Slope and looking for cheaper real estate moved into the homes in the historic areas. Residents started buying their houses and forming block associations; the high percentage of buyers who were middle-class black residents made it atypical from other gentrification waves on the time in the city that displaced the current residents. Owners in the Prospect Park South neighborhood hired private security to patrol the neighbhorhood. Residents lobbied commercial business to return to the area. Local merchants, the city, and the Flatbush Development Corporation worked to revitalize the neighborhood&#x27;s commercial core. The Flatbush Avenue Business Improvement District was founded in 1990, and by 1996 included 195 merchants on the stretch of road between Parkside Avenue and Cortelyou Road.

===21st century===

In the 2000s, Flatbush began to shed its poor reputation, and residents came to the area for its cheaper prices, attractive housing stock, and retail. The Junction was redeveloped with the addition of Target Corporation&#x27;s largest-ever store. The demographics of the neighborhood continued to shift; new Jewish residents from Syria arrived alongside Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Russians, and Chinese. The Muslim community was hit hard in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks; an estimated 20,000 residents left voluntarily or otherwise after immigration crackdowns. Recognizing the changed makeup of the eastern part of the neighborhood, the city designated two areas &quot;Little Caribbean&quot; and &quot;Little Haiti&quot; in 2017 and 2018, respectively.

The &quot;Times&quot; featured the neighborhood in 2016 as one of four in the city where real estate was expected to take off, as buyers looked for more affordable options. Flatbush was disparately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic compared to higher-income parts of the city. As housing prices have increased, the neighborhood&#x27;s predominantly black population has begun to shrink.

The neighborhood continues to face issues as a lower-income neighborhood compared to the city, with a 2016 WNYC reporting finding the neighborhood was disproportionately the target of Vision Zero traffic safety enforcement compared to whiter neighborhoods like Williamsburg and Greenpoint. A 2023 &quot;Gothamist&quot; analysis of 311 data revealed the neighborhood was one of the largest problem areas in the city for illegal waste dumping.

Little remains of the original Flatbush village and its surroundings. The 18th-century Lefferts family house, which resided in Flatbush, was moved in 1918 from its original location to Prospect Park along Flatbush Avenue. Near the Lefferts house is a former toll booth from the 19th century that once sat along the Flatbush Turnpike leading to Brooklyn. Other historic houses nearby include the Wyckoff-Bennett Homestead, built 1766, and the Wyckoff House, built on Twiller&#x27;s Flats. A marker in Prospect Park marks the site of Battle Pass. The Flatbush Reformed Dutch Church remains at the historic center of Flatbush at Church and Flatbush Avenues.

==Geographic boundaries==

When Flatbush merged with Brooklyn, the old town became coterminous with the 29th ward. There are no official boundaries for the modern neighborhood, which is smaller than the old boundaries of the town, and have long been disputed. In 1928, the &quot;Brooklyn Standard Union&quot; gave an expansive definition of Flatbush as running from Ocean Parkway in the west to Schenectady Avenue in the east, and from Prospect Park in the north as far south as Sheepshead Bay. By the 1960s, the northern region of the neighborhood was now considered part of Crown Heights instead. 1980s &quot;New York Times&quot; articles, following the definition of the Flatbush Development Corporation, outlined the narrow boundaries as Parkside Avenue to the north, Bedford Avenue to the east, Avenue H to the south, and Coney Island Avenue to the west. However they also noted that some residents still considered Midwood part of Flatbush, and the historic definitions had it stretch from Ocean Parkway to New York Avenue. By the 2000s, the &quot;Times&quot; had shifted the boundaries eastward, with New York Avenue the eastern border and Ocean Avenue the western one; the paper also noted that the area is one with fuzzier boundaries, compared to neighborhoods with sharp, widely-agreed-upon delineations. The borders roughly coincide with Brooklyn Community District 14, which also includes portions of Midwood and Kensington.
Over time, neighborhoods once considered part of Flatbush have gained their own distinct identities. These include the planned communities of Prospect Park South, the Beverley Squares (Beverley Square East and Beverley Square West), Prospect Lefferts Gardens, Ditmas Park, Fiske Terrace, Victorian Flatbush, and Albemarle-Kenmore Terrace. Bordering Flatbush on the north is Crown Heights, to the east is East Flatbush, to the west is Kensington and Parkville, and to the south is Midwood.

==Landmarks==

Well-known institutions within Flatbush include Erasmus Hall High School, the Parade Ground, the Flatbush Dutch Reformed Church, and Brooklyn College. The Kings Theatre, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, operated from 1929 to 1977; it reopened as a live show venue in February 2015 after extensive renovations.

Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 25% are between the ages of 0–17, 29% between 25–44, and 24% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 9% and 13% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 14 was $56,599. In 2018, an estimated 22% of Flatbush and Midwood residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in eleven residents (9%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Flatbush and Midwood, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively.

As according to the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning showed a diverse racial population, though the concentrations of each racial groups varied between different sections of Flatbush. Western portions of the community had between 10,000 to 19,999 White residents, 5,000 to 9,999 Black residents, and each the Hispanic and Asian populations were between 5,000 to 9,999 residents. Eastern portions of the community had between 30,000 to 39,999 Black residents, 10,000 to 19,999 Hispanic residents, and 5,000 to 9,999 White residents.

== Community organizations ==

<doc id="626247" wikidata="Q62098182" url="?curid=626247" title="Jungle babbler">
<text>The jungle babbler (Argya striata) is a member of the family Leiothrichidae found in the Indian subcontinent. Jungle babblers are gregarious birds that forage in small groups of six to ten birds, a habit that has given them the popular name of &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; in urban Northern India, and (seven brothers) in Bengali, with cognates in other regional languages which also mean &quot;seven brothers&quot;.

The jungle babbler is a common resident breeding bird in most parts of the Indian subcontinent and is often seen in gardens within large cities as well as in forested areas. In the past, the orange-billed babbler, &quot;Turdoides rufescens&quot;, of Sri Lanka was considered to be a subspecies of jungle babbler, but has now been elevated to a species.

==Taxonomy==
The jungle babbler was described by the French zoologist Charles Dumont de Sainte Croix in 1823, based on specimens from Bengal. He coined the binomial name &quot;Cossyphus striatus&quot;. This babbler was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Turdoides&quot; but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Argya&quot;.

There are several named geographically isolated subspecies that show plumage shade differences. Former race &quot;rufescens&quot; of Sri Lanka is considered a full species. The widely accepted subspecies include:
* &quot;A. s. striata&quot; (Dumont de Sainte Croix, 1823) which is found over much of northern India south of the Himalayan foothills extending to Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bhutan, Assam, Odisha and northeastern Andhra Pradesh. The form found in parts of Odisha, &quot;orissae&quot;, is said to be more rufous above and is usually subsumed into this.
* &quot;A. s. sindiana&quot; (Ticehurst, 1920) is a paler desert form that is found in the Indus River plains of Pakistan and extends into Rajasthan and the Rann of Kutch in India.
* &quot;A. s. somervillei&quot; (Sykes, 1832) is found in the northern Western Ghats.
* &quot;A. s. malabarica&quot; (Jerdon, 1845) is found in the southern Western Ghats.
* &quot;A. s. orientalis&quot; (Jerdon, 1845) is found in peninsular India east of the Western Ghats.

Some older literature can be confusing due to some incorrect usage, such as with Whistler (1944, &quot;Spolia Zeylanica&quot;, 23:131), who used the name &quot;affinis&quot; which is a completely different species, &quot;Turdoides affinis&quot;, restricted to peninsular India. Although the two can sometimes be confused in poor lighting conditions, their calls are entirely different.

==Description==

The jungle babbler&#x27;s habitat is forest and cultivation. This species, like most babblers, is non-migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight. The sexes are identical, drably coloured in brownish grey with a yellow-bill making them confusable only with the endemic yellow-billed babblers of peninsular India and Sri Lanka. The upper parts are usually slightly darker in shade and there is some mottling on the throat and breast. The race &quot;T. s. somervillei&quot; of Maharashtra has a very rufous tail and dark primary flight feathers. The jungle babbler can be separated from the white-headed babbler by the dark loreal zone between the bill and the eye as well as the lack of a contrasting light crown. The calls of the two species are however distinct and unmistakable. The jungle babbler has harsh nasal calls while the white-headed babbler has high pitched calls. Another babbler that is similarly found in urban areas is the large grey babbler; however, that species has a distinctive long tail with white outer tail feathers.

The jungle babbler lives in flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the harsh mewing calls, continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members.

==Behaviour and ecology==

These birds are gregarious and very social. They sometimes form the core of a mixed-species foraging flock. They feed mainly on insects, but also eat grains, nectar and berries. The groups maintain territories and will defend them against neighbours, which are nevertheless sometimes tolerated. For their size, they are long lived and have been noted to live as long as 16.5 years in captivity.

When foraging, some birds take up a high vantage point and act as sentinels. They are known to gather and mob potential predators such as snakes. A study of their activity budget showed them to have greater similarity to social primates than to comparable birds.

Young birds have a dark iris. Older birds have an iris of a pale creamy colour and it has been found that the iris has a dark epithelium, which becomes invisible when the muscle fibres develop in the iris and make the dark basal colours invisible and thus appear cream-coloured.

They breed throughout the year, with peak breeding in northern India being noted between March–April and July–September. Birds reach sexual maturity after their third year. The nest is built halfway up in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is three or four (but can be up to seven) deep greenish blue eggs. In northern India, birds breeding during July–September tend to be parasitized by the pied crested cuckoo and sometimes by the common hawk-cuckoo. Helpers assist the parents in feeding the young. Post fledging survival is very high.

Birds fledge and females tend to leave their natal group after about two years. Birds within a group often indulge in allopreening, play chases and mock fights. When threatened by predators, they have been said to sometimes feign death.

==In culture==
These birds are very common near towns and cities particularly in northern India and are well known for their habit of moving in groups giving them the local name of &quot;Sat Bhai&quot; which means seven brethren but translated by the English in India to &quot;Seven sisters&quot;. Visitors to India were very likely to notice these vocal and active birds and Frank Finn notes an incident during the Colonial period in India:

The Indian folklorist Saratcandra Mitra recorded a belief among the Lushai-Kuki people that during a solar eclipse, humans could transform into jungle babblers.

<doc id="626248" wikidata="Q2830803" url="?curid=626248" title="Albany Park, Chicago">
<text>Albany Park ( ) is one of 77 well-defined community areas of Chicago, Illinois, United States. Located on the Northwest Side of the City of Chicago with the North Branch of the Chicago River forming its east and north boundaries, it includes the ethnically diverse Albany Park neighborhood, with one of the highest percentages of foreign-born residents of any Chicago neighborhood.

Although the majority of those foreign-born residents are from Latin America, mostly from Mexico (especially from the state of Michoacán), Guatemala, and Ecuador, substantial numbers are from the Philippines, India, Korea, Cambodia, Somalia, Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia, Romania, Pakistan and the Middle East (especially Iraq, Iran, and Lebanon). Over 40 different languages are spoken in its public schools.

Due to the diverse population and immigrant population attraction, the population of the neighborhood increased by 16.5% during the 1990s.

==History==
The area was settled in 1893 when several investors purchased land in the area as areas closer to downtown became more heavily populated. DeLancy Louderback from Albany, New York was one of the investors and chose the name.

The developers added electric streetcars in 1896 and the Northwestern Elevated Railroad extended the Ravenswood branch to the Kimball terminal on December 14, 1907. This led to a building boom in the area. At this point in development, the north branch of the Chicago River meandered greatly, and therefore the Chicago Sanitary District straightened the river. This expanded and defined property lines and sewage in Albany Park.

By 1930, the population of the neighborhood reached 55,000, and many schools, religious institutions, and parks opened. Haugan Elementary School became the biggest elementary school in the city and Roosevelt High School&#x27;s overcrowding led to Von Steuben Elementary being converted into a high school. Residents began moving to northern suburbs after World War II and the population declined quickly, leaving many stores uninhabited and properties empty. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1970s, when a new immigration wave from Asia (mainly Korea) and Central America began to increase the population again. Today, Albany Park is the most diverse neighborhood in the city, and one of the most diverse in the entire country.

==Neighborhoods==
The traditional neighborhoods within the official community are (including rough boundaries):
* Albany Park: North: North Branch of the Chicago River (about 5100 N); South: Montrose Avenue (4400 N): East: North Branch of the River (about 3000 W); West: Pulaski Road (4000 W).
* Mayfair: North: Lawrence Avenue (4800 N); South: Cullom Avenue (4300 N); East: Pulaski Road (4000 W); West: Lamon Avenue (4900 W).
* North Mayfair: North: Bryn Mawr Avenue (5600 N); South: Lawrence Avenue (4800 N); East: Pulaski Road (4000 W); West: Lamon Avenue (4900 W).
* Ravenswood Manor: North: Lawrence Avenue (4800 N); South: Montrose Avenue (4400 N); East: the Chicago River; West: Sacramento Avenue.&quot;

Immediately to the north, in North Park, lie Northeastern Illinois University, North Park University, and the Bohemian National Cemetery.

===Korean commercial district===

The neighborhood was once known as the &quot;Koreatown&quot; of Chicago, beginning in the 1980s. The majority of Korean shops in Albany Park were found on Lawrence Avenue (4800 North) between Kedzie Avenue (3200 West) and Pulaski Road (4000 West), and many are still there. This particular section of Lawrence Avenue has been officially nicknamed &quot;Seoul Drive&quot; by the city of Chicago because of the multitude of Korean-owned enterprises on the street. Although many of the Korean Americans in the neighborhood have been moving to the north suburbs in recent years, it still retains some Korean flavor. Previously there was a Korean festival in nearby North Park, but was last held in the late 2010s. The neighborhood was home to a Korean radio station (1330 AM) before the station moved to Des Plaines, and then Wheeling, IL, before shutting down in 2023. Albany Park was also once home to two Korean-language newspapers, but these have since moved to the suburbs. There are still some Korean businesses interspersed among the newer Mexican bakeries and Middle Eastern grocery stores. However, the Korean diaspora has increasingly left Albany Park in recent years for other cities or suburbs such as Niles and Glenview. From 1997 to 2017, the Korean business presence on Lawrence Avenue fell from 158 to 50. This loss has been attributed to shifts in immigration policy decreasing the number of visas allocated to Korean immigrants, as well as pursuit of economic opportunities outside of Chicago.

== Demographics ==

After Jefferson Township was purchased and annexed by the city of Chicago and development began in the area that became Albany Park, immigrant German and Swedish farmers flocked to land. Many built their own homes. At the beginning of the 20th century, more upwardly mobile Russian Jews arrived in Albany Park to escape the crowded conditions of the very-heavily Jewish Near West Side/Maxwell Street area. This pattern continued as other residents in other Jewish-populated neighborhoods such as Lawndale and parts of West Town followed suit. These families began moving to northern suburbs such as Skokie after World War II. Starting in the 1970s, immigrants from Asia and Latin America, mainly Korea and Guatemala, began moving into the neighborhood&#x27;s largely vacant properties and storefronts. Immigration continued from all around the world, and by the 1990s, there were large populations from the Philippines, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Poland, Vietnam, Burma, Cambodia, Mexico (largely from the state of Michoacán), Ecuador, and Colombia. Since the 1992-1995 war in Yugoslavia, roughly 1,200 Serbians who lived in Croatia resettled in Albany Park along with more than 4,000 Bosnians of all three backgrounds. Into the 2000s, the western part of the neighborhood became home to a substantial number of Indian and East African immigrants.

<text>The United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF) was a formation of the United States Army Air Forces. It became the overall command and control authority of the United States Army Air Forces in the European theater of World War II.

USSTAF had started as the Eighth Air Force, a complementary command to that of the smaller Ninth Air Force, Twelfth Air Force, and Fifteenth Air Forces. As the oldest command, which had begun the earliest American operations in Europe as VIII Bomber Command, the Eighth had provided British liaison and strategic tasking guidance to each of those younger organizations throughout the war.

With the in-depth Allied contacts and overall responsibility directly affecting the strategic bombing of industrial regions of Germany the Eighth&#x27;s planning and intelligence staffs were the natural best choice to assert overall coordinated control with the D-Day Operation Overlord needs of the Allies, under General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Supreme Allied Commander. Subsequently, the strategic bombing effort&#x27;s intelligence, targeting and planning, co-ordination, including mission designation command and control were separated—not without controversy and opposition—from actual operations commands in direct control of air forces on 23 February 1944. The new command was organized on the large nucleus of Eighth Air Force planning staff members, thereby creating the USSTAF—at which time the USSTAF was also given mission planning control over other US Air Forces opposing Germany and Italy, and shrinking the man-power assigned to the Eighth Air Force.

The USSTAF was established with the redesignation of the former VIII Bomber Command as the Eighth Air Force on 22 February 1944. The strategic planning command staff of what had formerly been the Eighth Air Force became a higher echelon command coordinating with the British in the target prioritization of the strategic bombing of the Axis. In this expanded role, USSTAF exercised operational control of the reorganized Eighth Air Force, administrative control of the Ninth Air Force in the European Theater of Operations and, to an extent, the operations of Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations—all of which had theretofore carried out their own strategic planning. VIII Fighter Command was brought under the command of the newly redesignated Eighth Air Force, while VIII Bomber Command was inactivated.

Beginning in March 1944, Air Service Command, USSTAF progressively took over all base service functions. IX Air Force Service Command did away with its base air depot area and on 17 May transferred its most important installations (Philipps House in Dinton, Wiltshire, near Baverstock and Filton) to the Air Service Command, USSTAF, which continued to use them to provide base services for the Ninth.

There is some difference of opinion about the USSTAF insignia/emblem. Most sources state the letters stand for &quot;United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe&quot;. However, there is evidence indicating – at least initially – it was &quot;United States Strategic &amp; Tactical Air Forces&quot;.

==Formation of USAFE==
Shortly after VE-Day, the United States Army Air Forces in Europe began to demobilize. In May 1945, USSTAF consisted of about 17,000 aircraft and about 500,000 personnel. In Europe the aim was to maintain a small USAAF organization, exclusively for communication and transport purposes. On 7 August 1945, the United States Strategic Air Forces (USSTAF) was redesignated as the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Headquarters USAFE was relocated to Wiesbaden, Germany, on 28 September 1945. By the end of 1946, the American Air Force in Europe was reduced drastically, to around 75,000 personnel and less than 2,000 aircraft.

<doc id="626274" wikidata="Q1765895" url="?curid=626274" title="Re (Café Tacuba album)">
<text>Re is the second studio album by Mexican rock band Café Tacuba, released in 1994. The album has been called &quot;the equivalent of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;White Album&quot; for the rock en español movement&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number one on its list of &quot;The 10 Greatest Latin Rock Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2024, it was ranked in third position on the “Los 600 de Latinoamérica” list compiled by a collective of music journalists, highlighting the top 600 Latin American albums from 1920-2022.

==Legacy==
&quot;Re&quot; album established Café Tacuba&#x27;s style of genre-switching, which had not been as prominent on their debut album &quot;Café Tacuba&quot;, released two years earlier. Its sheer length – an hour long – and experimentation with musical styles have made it a favorite among fans. One notable aspect of the album is that it contains several musical genres, notably norteño, huapango, banda, and bolero.

Colombian rock band Aterciopelados performed a song entitled &quot;Re&quot; as an homage to the band and the album on their 2016 live album &quot;Reluciente, Rechinante y Aterciopelado&quot;.

&quot;Re&quot; had sold 125,000 units in Mexico, 15,000 in Chile and 50,000 in the United States.

<doc id="626279" wikidata="Q62098144" url="?curid=626279" title="Yellow-billed babbler">
<text>The yellow-billed babbler (Argya affinis) is a member of the family Leiothrichidae endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. The yellow-billed babbler is a common resident breeding bird in Sri Lanka and southern India. Its habitat is scrub, cultivation and garden land. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight and is usually seen calling and foraging in groups. It is often mistaken for the jungle babbler, whose range overlaps in parts of southern India, although it has a distinctive call and tends to be found in more vegetated habitats. Its name is also confused with &quot;Turdoides leucocephala&quot;, which is also known as white-headed babbler.

==Taxonomy==
The yellow-billed babbler was formerly placed in the genus &quot;Turdoides&quot; but following the publication of a comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study in 2018, it was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Argya&quot;.

==Description==

These birds have grey brown upperparts, a grey throat and breast with some mottling, and a pale buff belly. The head and nape are grey, and the eyes are bluish white. The nominate race, found in southern India, has a whitish crown and nape, with a darker mantle. The rump is pale and the tail has a broad dark tip. The Sri Lankan subspecies &quot;A. a. taprobanus&quot; is drab pale grey. Birds in the extreme south of India are very similar to the Sri Lankan subspecies with the colour of the crown and back being more grey than the nominate race. The Indian form is more heavily streaked on the throat and breast. The Sri Lankan subspecies resembles the jungle babbler, &quot;Turdoides striatus&quot;, although that species does not occur on the island.

Seven distinctive vocalisations have been noted in this species and this species has a higher pitched call than the jungle babbler. The jungle babbler has calls that have a harsher and nasal quality.

The taxonomy of this species was confused in the past and confounded with the sympatric jungle babbler and the orange-billed babbler of Sri Lanka.
==Distribution and habitat==
This species is patchily distributed in southern India and Sri Lanka. The nominate subspecies is found in Andhra Pradesh, south of the Godavari river and Karnataka south of Belgaum into Tamil Nadu. It prefers lower altitudes and drier habitats than the jungle babbler but sometimes is found alongside it. The Sri Lankan subspecies is found in the lowlands and hills up to about 1500m avoiding heavy forest. It is a common garden bird and frequently visits urban and suburban areas.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The yellow-billed babbler lives in flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a very noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. Sometimes, all the members start chattering loud enough to irritate the human ear significantly. One member often perches high and acts as a sentinel while the remaining members of the flock forage on or close to the ground. They feed mainly on insects, but also eat fruit, nectar and human food scraps. They have been known to take &quot;Calotes versicolor&quot; lizards and whip-scorpions. They do not fly long distances; the maximum distance flown non-stop was about 180 m and prior to flying, they usually gain height by moving up a tree or tall shrub. Black drongos, rufous treepies and Indian palm squirrels are often seen foraging near these babblers.

The babblers wake before dawn around 6:00 AM and begin foraging. They are relatively inactive in the hot hours of the day from 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM. They assemble in groups around 7:00 PM and preen themselves before going to roost. Members of a group roost next to each other with some juveniles wedging themselves in the middle of the group. When foraging the sentinel bird calls with wing fluttering and hopping. Allopreening is a common activity, particularly in winter, and members may beg for food from other members. Yellow-billed babblers particularly like to bathe, and may visit birdbaths in their general territories, usually around late afternoon to evening. Sometimes these birds have been observed visiting bird baths at around 6:30 PM, after sunset.

A study in the Sivakasi plains noted that groups had a home range of 0.4 km2 and the population density was about 55 birds per km2.

===Breeding===
Nests of the species are seen throughout the year but the peak breeding season is prior to the onset of the Indian southwest monsoon. Nests are built in trees, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The majority of nests are built below a height of four metres from the ground. The nest is a small cup placed in a fork of a branch. The normal clutch is two to four turquoise blue eggs, although up to five may be laid by birds in the hills of Sri Lanka. The eggs hatch after 14 to 16 days. The brooding parent bird often stands on the rim of the nest rather than sit on the chicks. Brood parasitism of the babblers&#x27; nests by the pied cuckoo (&quot;Clamator jacobinus&quot;) is known from both India and Sri Lanka. The common hawk-cuckoo has also been noted as a brood parasite. In an exceptional case, jungle babblers have been seen feeding the chicks of the yellow-billed babbler. Chicks are mainly fed insects and the occasional lizard. Like most perching birds, the parents take care of nest sanitation, removing the faecal sacs of the young, typically by swallowing them. Helpers have been seen to assist the parents in building the nest as well as in feeding the chicks at the nest.

===Mortality===
Predators of the eggs include mongoose, crows and the greater coucal which may also prey on chicks. Rat snakes (&quot;Ptyas mucosus&quot;) may sometimes take chicks.

==In culture==

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;demalichcha&quot; in Sinhala language.
In Tamil Nadu, this bird is known as &quot;Thavittu-kuruvi&quot;, &quot;Pandri-kuruvi, &quot;Velaikkara-kuruvi&quot;, &quot;Kalani-kuruvi&quot;, &quot;Pooniyal kuruvi&quot;,&quot;Oor kuruvi&quot; in Tamil language.

==Tourism==

 north of Sanjiang, toward Hunan province, lies the area of Dong people, Chengyang (程阳), which is a popular destination for backpacker tourism. The area comprises eight traditional Dong minority villages. The houses are all made of wood. Inside the villages you will find traditional drum towers, which were used to announce important things or simply to perform plays to entertain the villagers. Crossing the river is the best preserved Wind and Rain Bridge (程阳风雨桥, chéng yáng fēng yǔ qiáo) which has five parts. The bridge dates to 1912 and is for many people the main reason to visit the village.

North of Chengyang lies the tiny village of Linxia which is interesting because of the local market, but there are no places to stay in Linxia.

<text>John Robert Stobo Prichard (born 17 January 1949) is a Canadian lawyer, economist, and academic. He is the past president and chief executive officer and former director of Torstar Corporation. He is now the chairman of the Bank of Montreal.

==Academia==
Born in London, England, Prichard attended prep school at Upper Canada College before studying economics at Swarthmore College, business at the University of Chicago, and law at the University of Toronto and Yale Law School.

Prichard joined the Faculty of Law at the University of Toronto in 1976. He served as dean of the faculty from 1984 to 1990.

Prichard was appointed the thirteenth president of the University of Toronto in 1990, a position which he held until 2000. During his ten years as president, the U of T&#x27;s endowment rose to $1.4 billion, the most of any Canadian university.

==&quot;Toronto Star&quot;==
Upon leaving the University of Toronto, Prichard became the president of the Star Media Group and chief operating officer of the Torstar Corporation in May 2001. In 2004, Prichard pushed out John Honderich as publisher of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; because he resisted making the deep cost cuts that Prichard demanded. However, in 2006, Honderich, a Torstar director who chairs a voting trust comprising five families that control Torstar, instigated a &quot;coup&quot; among the five families that resulted in the termination of Prichard&#x27;s chosen publisher Michael Goldbloom and editor-in-chief Giles Gherson. Some have suggested that Torstar&#x27;s financial woes have been caused by Prichard&#x27;s distraction by his presence on several boards, including Onex and Four Seasons.

Prichard has also been a member of Imasco&#x27;s board of directors since 1993. Imasco owns and controls Imperial Tobacco, the largest tobacco manufacturer in Canada. Prichard&#x27;s involvement with Imasco was the subject of criticism, due to a perceived conflict of interest for his role as university head. During Prichard&#x27;s term as president, the University of Toronto accepted $2 million from Imasco between 1997 and 1999. In 1998, Imasco contributed just over $2.5 million to educational institutions across the country. Similar conflict of interest concerns have been raised about the 2005 deal engineered by Prichard by which Torstar acquired a 20 per cent stake in broadcaster and rival publisher Bell Globemedia Inc.

==Political work==
Prichard served on the transition teams of three Ontario premiers of three different parties: Liberal David Peterson in 1985, New Democrat Bob Rae in 1990, and Progressive Conservative Mike Harris in 1995.

Prichard was deemed by several political insiders to be a contender in the race to become Liberal Party Leader, following the resignation of former Prime Minister Paul Martin.

==Business career==
Prichard is past president and chief executive officer and former director of Torstar Corporation, and also sits on the boards of George Weston Limited, Onex Corporation, and is the chairman of the board of the Bank of Montreal.
==Current work==
Prichard is the chair of the board of Metrolinx and Penguin Group Canada, as well as the chair of Toronto law firm Torys LLP.

<doc id="626306" wikidata="Q954886" url="?curid=626306" title="1979 Canadian federal election">
<text>The 1979 Canadian federal election was held on May 22, 1979, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 31st Parliament of Canada. It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 16 years in power, 11 of them under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons. The Liberals, however, beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes (40.11% to 35.89%). Taking office on the eve of his 40th birthday, Clark became the youngest prime minister in Canadian history.

==Overview==
The PC Party campaigned on the slogans, &quot;Let&#x27;s get Canada working again&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s time for a change – give the future a chance!&quot; Canadians were not, however, sufficiently confident in the young Joe Clark to give him a majority in the House of Commons. Quebec, in particular, was unwilling to support Clark and elected only two PC Members of Parliament (MPs) in the province&#x27;s 75 ridings. Clark, relatively unknown when elected as PC leader at the 1976 PC Party convention, was seen as being bumbling and unsure. Clark had had problems with certain right-wing members of his caucus. In particular, when Clark&#x27;s riding was merged into the riding of another PC MP during a redistribution of ridings, the other MP refused to step aside, and Clark ended up running in another riding. Also, when Clark undertook a tour of the Middle East to show his ability to handle foreign affairs issues, his luggage was lost, and Clark appeared to be uncomfortable with the issues being discussed.

The Liberals tried to make leadership and Clark&#x27;s inexperience the issue by arguing in their advertising, &quot;This is no time for on-the-job training&quot; and &quot;We need tough leadership to keep Canada growing. A leader must be a leader.&quot;

The Social Credit Party of Canada, which had lost its mercurial leader, Réal Caouette, who died in 1976, struggled to remain relevant. After a series of interim leaders, including Caouette&#x27;s son, the party turned to Fabien Roy, a popular member of the National Assembly of Quebec, who took the reins of the party just before the beginning of the campaign. The party won the tacit support of the separatist &quot;Parti Québécois&quot;, which formed the government of Quebec. Social Credit attempted to rally the separatist and nationalist vote: Canadian flags were absent at its campaign kick-off rally, and the party&#x27;s slogan was &quot;C&#x27;est à notre tour&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s our turn&quot;), which was reminiscent of the popular separatist anthem &quot;Gens du pays&quot; (&quot;People of the Country&quot;), which includes the chorus, &quot;C&#x27;est votre tour, de vous laisser parler d&#x27;amour&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s your turn, to let you talk about love&quot;). The party focused its platform on constitutional change, which promised to fight to abolish the federal government&#x27;s constitutional power to disallow any provincial legislation and stated that each province has a &quot;right to choose its own destiny within Canada.&quot;

The Socreds&#x27; support from the Parti Québécois was not welcome by everyone; for instance, Gilles Caouette publicly denounced what he called &quot;péquistes déguisés en créditistes&quot; (&quot;péquistes disguised as Socreds&quot;). What remained of its support outside Quebec virtually disappeared, and while the party only suffered a marginal loss in its overall Quebec vote share, its support was much less efficiently distributed than before. The party managed some increase of votes in péquiste areas, but also lost many votes in areas of traditional Socred strength while much of the reduced PC vote share went to the Liberals. The end result was a drop from eleven to six seats. &quot;(See also: Social Credit Party candidates, 1979 Canadian federal election.)&quot;

Clark&#x27;s minority government lasted less than nine months. Clark required support from the Socreds to pass the 1979 budget but refused to work with them on ideological grounds, opting instead to &quot;govern as though he had a majority.&quot; With none of their demands being met, the Socreds refused to prop up the government. That resulted in the 1980 election in which the PCs were defeated by the resurgent Trudeau Liberals.

As of January 2025, this is the earliest Canadian election from which a major party leader (Clark) is still alive.

==National results==
Clark won the popular vote in seven provinces, while losing the popular vote nationwide, and because his party won only two seats in Quebec, he won only a minority government. The Liberals won only one seat west of Manitoba. The election was the last in which the Social Credit Party of Canada won seats. An unusual event occurred in the Northwest Territories: the Liberals took more votes overall than any other party but won neither of the territory&#x27;s two seats.

<doc id="626308" wikidata="Q663694" url="?curid=626308" title="Waler">
<text>The Waler is an Australian breed of horse that was developed from horses that were brought to the Australian colonies in the 19th century. The name comes from their breeding origins in New South Wales; they were originally known as &quot;New South Walers&quot;.

==Origins and characteristics==
The Waler combined a variety of breeds; particularly the Thoroughbred, Arab, the Cape horse (from the Cape of Good Hope), Timor Pony and perhaps a little Clydesdale or Percheron. It was originally considered only a &quot;type&quot; of horse and not a distinct breed. However, as a landrace bred under the extreme climate and challenging working conditions of Australia, the Waler developed into a hardy horse with great endurance even when under extreme stress from lack of food and water. It was used as a stockman&#x27;s horse and prized as a military remount. Walers were also used by bushrangers, troopers and exploration expeditions that traversed inland Australia.

The preferred Walers for cavalry duties were 15 to 16 hands high (). Those over 16 hands were rejected for use in the South Australian Bushmen Corps. Unbroken horses, as well as those with grey and broken (spotted) coat colours were also rejected. The selected horses had to be of a good type that could carry sixteen or seventeen stone (102 to 108 kg (224 to 238 lbs)) day after day.

The Walers carried the rider, saddle, saddle cloth, bridle, head collar, lead rope, a horseshoe case with one front and one hind shoe, nails, rations for the horse and rider, a bedroll, change of clothing, a rifle and about 90 rounds of .303 rifle ammunition.

The gaits of the Waler were considered ideal for a cavalry mount; it could maintain a fast walk and could progress directly to a steady, level canter without resorting to a trot which was noisy, liable to dislodge gear and resulted in soreness in the horse&#x27;s back. The cavalry horse required docility, courage, speed and athletic ability, as it carried the rider into battle. The infantryman&#x27;s horse was used as a means of transport from one point to another, for example, from camp to a battle ground, where the horses were kept back from the fighting. Heavier animals were selected and used for draught and packhorse duties.

Most of the early Walers carried a fair percentage of Thoroughbred blood, with some recorded as race winners and a few being registered in the Australian Stud Book. While in warfare service in North Africa, some Walers proved successful in races against local Egyptian horses and assorted Thoroughbreds. In 1919, horses from the ANZAC Mounted Division won five of the six events at Heliopolis, near Cairo.

===Memorial statue===
A memorial statue to the Waler Light Horse was erected at Tamworth, New South Wales as a tribute to the men of the ANZAC Corps who served in the Boer, Sudan and First World Wars. This memorial was constructed at a cost of $150,000, funded by grants from Federal and State Governments, the Tamworth Regional Council, Joblink Plus and donations from business houses, property owners, RSL Members and the community. It was designed and created by sculptor Tanya Bartlett from Newcastle, New South Wales. The military equipment is identical to that used in the First World War. Forty-seven light horse re-enactment riders and the 12th/16th Hunter River Lancers took part in the unveiling by Major General William B. &quot;Digger&quot; James AC MBE MC (Retd) on 29 October 2005.

==History==
Australian horses were sent overseas from the 1830s; between the 1840s and 1940s, there was a steady trade in Walers to the British Indian Army.

In Australia&#x27;s two wars of the early 20th century—the Second Boer War and World War I—the Waler was the backbone of the Australian Light Horse mounted forces. It was especially suited to working in the harsh climate of the Sinai Peninsula and Palestine, where it proved superior to the camel as a means of transporting large bodies of troops.

===Boer War===
During the Boer War, Australia dispatched 16,314 horses overseas for use by the Australian Infantry Forces.

===World War I===
In the First World War, 121,324 Walers were sent overseas to the allied armies in Africa, Europe, India and Palestine. Of these, 39,348 served with the First Australian Imperial Force, mainly in the Middle East, while 81,976 were sent to India. Due to the costs said to be incurred for &quot;returning horses home&quot; with their mounts and perhaps to a lesser extent, quarantine restrictions, only one Waler is known to have been returned to Australia; &quot;Sandy&quot;, the mount of Major-General W. T. Bridges, an officer who died at Gallipoli in May 1915.

The English cavalry officer, Lt. Col. R. M. P. Preston DSO, summed up the Australian Light Horses&#x27; performance in his book, &quot;The Desert Mounted Corps:&quot; 
&quot;… (November 16th, 1917) The operations had now continued for 17 days practically without cessation, and a rest was absolutely necessary especially for the horses. Cavalry Division had covered nearly 170 miles…and their horses had been watered on an average of once in every 36 hours…. The heat, too, had been intense and the short rations, 9½ lb of grain per day without bulk food, had weakened them greatly. Indeed, the hardship endured by some horses was almost incredible. One of the batteries of the Australian Mounted Division had only been able to water its horses three times in the last nine days - the actual intervals being 68, 72 and 76 hours respectively. Yet this battery on its arrival had lost only eight horses from exhaustion, not counting those killed in action or evacuated wounded.

… The majority of horses in the Corps were Walers and there is no doubt that these hardy Australian horses make the finest cavalry mounts in the world…. They (the Australians) have got types of compact, well-built, saddle and harness horses that no other part of the world can show. Rather on the light side according to our ideas, but hard as nails and with beautiful clean legs and feet. Their records in this war place them far above the Cavalry horse of any other nation. The Australians themselves can never understand our partiality for the half-bred weight-carrying hunter, which looks to them like a cart horse. Their contention has always been that good blood will carry more weight than big bone, and the experience of this war has converted the writer, for one, entirely to their point of view. It must be remembered that the Australian countrymen are bigger, heavier men than their English brothers. They formed just half the Corps and it probable that they averaged not far off 12 stone each stripped. To this weight must be added another 9-1/2 stone for saddle, ammunition, sword, rifle, clothes and accoutrements, so that each horse carried a weight of 21 stone, all day for every day for 17 days, - on less than half the normal ration of forage and with only one drink in every 36 hours!

The weight-carrying English Hunter had to be nursed back to fitness after these operations and for a long period, while the little Australian horses without any special care, other than good food and plenty of water were soon fit to go through another campaign as arduous as the last one!….&quot;
One well-known Waler was Major Michael Shanahan&#x27;s mount, &quot;Bill the Bastard&quot;, who bucked when asked to gallop. Yet, during World War I, when the major (or captain) found four Australians outflanked by the Turks, &quot;Bill the Bastard&quot; took all five men – three on his back and one on each stirrup – through soft sand at a lumbering gallop, without first bucking.

====Not to return to Australia====

::&quot;Owing to the cost and difficulties of transportation, the military authorities had decided to kill all Light Horse horses over 12 years and dispose of the remainder locally – that would be in Egypt, Palestine, Mesopotamia, or wherever a Light Horse unit happened to be stationed.&quot; -- &quot;The World&#x27;s News&quot;, 1 February 1919.
At the end of the war, 11,000 surplus horses in the Middle East were sold to the British Army as remounts for Egypt and India. Others, categorised as being unfit, were destroyed. Also, some light horsemen chose to destroy their horses rather than part with them, but this was an exception, despite the popular myth that portrays it as the fate of all the war horses. Parting with their Walers was one of the hardest events the light horsemen had to endure.

A poem by Major Oliver Hogue, 14th Australian Light Horse Regiment (&quot;Trooper Bluegum&quot;) sums up the men&#x27;s sentiment:
::&quot;I don&#x27;t think I could stand the thought of my old fancy hack&quot;
::&quot;   Just crawling round old Cairo with a &#x27;Gyppo on his back.&quot;
::&quot;Perhaps some English tourist out in Palestine may find&quot;
::&quot;   My broken-hearted Waler with a wooden plough behind.&quot;

::&quot;No: I think I&#x27;d better shoot him and tell a little lie:--&quot;
::&quot;   &quot;He floundered in a wombat hole and then lay down to die.&quot;&quot;
::&quot;May be I&#x27;ll get court-martialled; but I&#x27;m damned if I&#x27;m inclined&quot;
::&quot;   To go back to Australia and leave my horse behind.&quot;
:::From &quot;Australia in Palestine&quot;, 1919

===World War II===
During World War II, 360 Australian Walers were assigned to the Texas National Guard 112th Cavalry in New Caledonia. The horses were eventually deemed unfit for jungle warfare. They were sent to India where they served with the Chinese Army before being assigned to the unit known as Merrill&#x27;s Marauders.

==Post-war==
As demand for remounts declined in the 1940s, the Waler trade declined. 

From 1959 until it was sold to Birds Australia to be converted into a wildlife sanctuary in 2000, Alex Coppock and his wife bred Walers on Newhaven Station in the Northern Territory. The horses were mostly rehomed elsewhere, although the original plan had been to deprive them of water and let them die. 

When the Australian Stock Horse Society was formed in 1971, the majority of horses accepted into its studbook were Waler horses. The ASHS also accepted horses of other breeds, notably Quarter horses, which has always been controversial. While many stock horses do have Quarter horse genetics in their breeding, not all do, as there are still many breeders who only breed horses of the old heritage bloodlines. These heritage stock horses have extensive pedigrees, often back to the 19th century, and are direct descendants of Walers with no Quarter Horse or other modern breeds.
===Reestablishment of the breed===
In the 1980s efforts began to reestablish the breed using feral Walers descended from horses that had been set loose in rural regions after the commercial trade ceased. The Waler horse now has two breed associations interested in preserving it, the Waler Horse Owners and Breeders Association Australia Inc. (WHOBAA) and the Waler Horse Society of Australia Inc (WHSA). Only horses and their progeny derived from the old bloodlines, with no imported genetics since 1945, can be registered as Walers with the WHOBAA.

Today&#x27;s Waler is a functional Australian horse, bred from bloodlines that came to Australia before 1945, that is free of imported genetics since that time.

==Threats to the breed==
In May 2013, up to 10,000 Walers were culled at Tempe Downs Station near Kings Canyon, about south-west of Alice Springs, Northern Territory, owing to concerns about water sustainability. Ian Conway, owner of neighbouring Kings Creek Station, said that it would be more cost-effective to train Aboriginal men to manage the horses than to cull them.

<text>The blackcap babbler (Turdoides reinwardtii) is a member of the family Leiothrichidae.

The blackcap babbler is a common resident breeding bird in west Africa from Senegal to Cameroon. Its habitat is thick scrub and forest. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight.

It builds its cup-shaped nest in a tree, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three eggs.

These birds have dark grey-brown upperparts. The head is brownish black with a white throat and conspicuous white eye ring. The underparts are white, mottled on the breast and with buff flanks.

The blackcap babbler lives in flocks of four to twelve or more, which help to raise the young communally. It is a noisy bird, and the presence of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. The main call is a &quot;cha-ka-ta&quot;. It feeds mainly on insects, but also eats fruit.

The binomial commemorates the botanist Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt.

<doc id="626331" wikidata="Q716319" url="?curid=626331" title="Billy Barty">
<text>Billy Barty (born William John Bertanzetti; October 25, 1924 – December 23, 2000) was an American actor and activist. In adult life, he stood tall, due to cartilage–hair hypoplasia dwarfism. Because of his short stature, he was often cast in films opposite taller performers for comic effect. He specialized in outspoken or wisecracking characters. During the 1950s, he became a television actor, appearing regularly in the Spike Jones ensemble. In the early 1970s, he appeared often in a variety of roles in children&#x27;s TV programs produced by Sid and Marty Krofft. As an activist for people with dwarfism, he founded the Little People of America organization in 1957.

==Early life==
Barty was born October 25, 1924, in Millsboro, Pennsylvania, the son of Albert Steven and Ellen Cecial Bertanzetti. His paternal grandfather was Italian. The family moved to California in 1927. He had two sisters, Delores and Evelyn.

==Career==
Barty co-starred with Mickey Rooney in the &quot;Mickey McGuire&quot; shorts, a comedy series of the 1920s and 1930s based on the &quot;Toonerville Folks&quot; comics. Small for his age even then, Barty would impersonate young children alongside brawny authority figures or wild animals, making these threats seem larger by comparison.

In the 1933 film &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, a nine-year-old Barty appeared as a baby who escapes from his stroller. He also appeared as The Child in the 1933 film &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;. He is seen briefly in the 1935 film &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot; in an uncredited role as a baby in one of Dr. Pretorius&#x27; experiments, although his close-ups were cut from the film&#x27;s final edit.

Much of Barty&#x27;s film work consisted of bit parts and gag roles. He appeared in &quot;Fireman Save My Child&quot; (with Spike Jones), and also appeared in two Elvis Presley films, &quot;Roustabout&quot; (in one scene) and &quot;Harum Scarum&quot;, as a co-star without dialogue.

Some of his more substantial film roles were as the elf Screwball in &quot;Legend&quot;; High Aldwin, the village elder, in &quot;Willow&quot; alongside Warwick Davis, creator of the cosmic key; Gwildor in the 1987 cult classic film &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot;; and as cameraman Noodles MacIntosh in &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;UHF&quot;.

===Television===
Barty appeared several times on &quot;The Dennis Day Show&quot;, including once as a leprechaun. Beginning in 1958, he played pool hustler Babby, an occasional &quot;information resource&quot;, in eight episodes of the &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; TV series. Barty starred in the &quot;Rawhide&quot; episode &quot;Prairie Elephant&quot; in 1961. He appeared in over a dozen episodes of &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot;, performing as a singer, comedian, dancer and impressionist. 

Barty also starred in a local Southern California children&#x27;s show, &quot;Billy Barty&#x27;s Bigtop&quot;, in the mid-1960s, which regularly showed &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; shorts. In one program, Stooge Moe Howard visited the set as a surprise guest. The program gave many Los Angeles area children their first opportunity to become familiar with little people, who until then had been rarely seen on the screen except as two-dimensional curiosities. He also appeared as a guest host on KTTV&#x27;s &quot;Sheriff John&#x27;s Lunch Brigade&quot; whenever &quot;Sheriff John&quot; Rovick was on vacation. Barty made regular appearances on &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot; during the mid-1960s.

Barty starred in full-body costumes in two children&#x27;s television shows produced by Sid and Marty Krofft: as &quot;Sparky the Firefly&quot; in &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; from 1970 to 1972, and as &quot;Sigmund&quot; in &quot;Sigmund and the Sea Monsters&quot; from 1974 to 1976. Out of costume, he played the evil sidekick on the Kroffts&#x27; &quot;Dr. Shrinker&quot; from 1976 to 1977. He portrayed Toulouse Lautrec in the 1972 &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot; Saturday morning cartoons preview special &quot;The Brady Bunch Meet ABC&#x27;s Saturday Superstars&quot;.

He was a regular cast member of comedian Redd Foxx&#x27;s variety show &quot;The Redd Foxx Show&quot;. Barty appeared in an episode of &quot;Barney Miller&quot; in 1977, and an episode of &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in 1978. Another show he guest-starred in was &quot;CHiPs&quot;. In June 1978, Barty guest-starred in the final episode of &quot;Man from Atlantis&quot; titled &quot;Deadly Carnival&quot;. He also guest starred in two episodes of &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; playing a circus member in the episode &quot;Annabelle&quot;. Also in a later episode (&quot;Little Lou&quot;) as a single father trying to raise a baby daughter. Barty was regularly seen on &quot;Bizarre&quot;, a weekly Canadian TV sketch comedy series, airing from 1980 to 1985. In 1981, he appeared in a documentary called &quot;Being Different&quot; and in late 1985, he appeared as Rose Nylund&#x27;s father in a dream sequence on an episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; titled &quot;A Little Romance&quot;.

In 1982, Barty appeared in an episode of &quot;Hart to Hart&quot; called &quot;A Christmas Hart&quot; (Season 4, Episode 10).

In 1983, Barty supplied the voice for &quot;Figment&quot; in Epcot&#x27;s Journey Into Imagination dark ride. He briefly reprised the role in the ride&#x27;s second version.

Barty was an annual guest-star on Canada&#x27;s &quot;Telemiracle&quot; telethon, one of the most successful (per capita) telethons in the world.

Barty appeared on a 1976 episode of &quot;Celebrity Bowling&quot; paired with Dick Martin, defeating John Schuck and Michael Ansara, 120–118. He also appeared as himself in the 1981 documentary film &quot;Being Different&quot;.

===Activism===

Barty was a noted activist for the promotion of rights for others with dwarfism. He was disappointed with contemporary Hervé Villechaize&#x27;s insistence that they were &quot;midgets&quot; instead of actors with dwarfism. Barty founded the Little People of America organization to help people with dwarfism in 1957 when he called upon people of short stature to join him in a get-together in Reno, Nevada. That original meeting of 21 people grew into Little People of America, a group which as of 2023 has more than 7,500 members. It was the first North American organization for little people.

===Other===
In 1981, Barty received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6922 Hollywood Boulevard for his contributions to the film industry.

In the 1980s, Barty owned a popular roller rink in Fullerton, California, that also booked bands on weekends.

In 1990, Barty was sued in small claims court by two of the writers of his cancelled comedy television series &quot;Short Ribbs&quot;, which aired for 13 weeks in the autumn of 1989 as a local program on KDOC-TV. Producer and writer William Winckler and writer Warren Taylor filed separate lawsuits against Barty for money owed, and Barty lost both cases. Barty claimed the lawsuit news was the most publicity he ever got, and compared it to similar press that celebrity Zsa Zsa Gabor received for slapping a Beverly Hills police officer.

A tribute book on Barty&#x27;s life was published in December 2002. &quot;Within Reach: An Inspirational Journey into the Life, Legacy and Influence of Billy Barty&quot; was produced by Barty&#x27;s nephew, Michael Copeland, and Copeland&#x27;s wife, Debra.

==Personal life==
In 1962, he married Shirley Bolingbroke of Malad City, Idaho. They had two children, Lori Neilson and TV/film producer and director Braden Barty.

Barty and his family were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

===Death===
Barty died of heart failure in 2000 at age 76. He is entombed in Glendale&#x27;s Forest Lawn Memorial Park.

<doc id="626345" wikidata="Q837100" url="?curid=626345" title="Washington State Route 99">
<text>State Route 99 (SR 99), also known as the Pacific Highway, is a state highway in the Seattle metropolitan area, part of the U.S. state of Washington. It runs from Fife to Everett, passing through the cities of Federal Way, SeaTac, Seattle, Shoreline, and Lynnwood. The route primarily follows arterial streets, including Aurora Avenue, and has several freeway segments, including the tolled SR 99 Tunnel in Downtown Seattle. SR 99 was officially named the William P. Stewart Memorial Highway by the state legislature in 2016, after a campaign to replace an unofficial moniker honoring Confederate president Jefferson Davis.

SR 99 was originally a section of U.S. Route 99 (US 99), which was once the state&#x27;s primary north–south highway before the construction of I-5. US 99 was created in 1926 and replaced earlier local roads that date back to the 1890s and state roads designated as early as 1913. The highway was moved onto the Alaskan Way Viaduct in 1953, replacing a congested stretch through Downtown Seattle, and other sections were built to expressway standards in the 1950s.

US 99 was ultimately replaced by the Tacoma–Everett section of Interstate 5 (I-5), which opened in stages between 1965 and 1969. The route was decertified in 1969, and SR 99 was created to keep segments of the highway under state control. After decades of crime on some sections of SR 99, various city governments funded projects to beautify the highway and convert it into a boulevard. A section of the highway in Tukwila was transferred to city control in 2004, creating a gap in the route between the interchanges of SR 518 and SR 599.

The Alaskan Way Viaduct was closed on January 11, 2019, and was replaced with a downtown bored tunnel that opened on February 4, 2019. The replacement project was spurred by the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, which damaged the viaduct and left it vulnerable to further damage, as well as city plans to revitalize the Seattle waterfront. The $3 billion megaproject was mired in planning delays for several years before construction began in 2011 with the partial demolition of the viaduct. The tunnel was constructed using Bertha, the world&#x27;s largest tunnel boring machine at the time of its launch in 2013, which had a two-year halt and completed its bore in 2017. The viaduct was demolished in 2019, leaving room for an expanded park promenade on Alaskan Way that is planned to be completed in 2024.

==Route description==

SR 99 follows a section of former U.S. Route 99 (US 99) within the Seattle metropolitan area, from Fife to southern Everett. It is officially designated as the William P. Stewart Memorial Highway, but is commonly known as the Pacific Highway or by one of its local names. The entire highway is listed as part of the National Highway System, a national network of roads identified as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. A section of the highway from Tukwila to Shoreline is also designated as a Highway of Statewide Significance by the state legislature. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) estimates that average traffic volumes on SR 99, measured in terms of annual average daily traffic for 2016, range from a minimum of 17,000 vehicles on Everett Mall Way to a maximum of 97,000 at the First Avenue South Bridge in Seattle.

===Fife to SeaTac===
SR 99 begins in Fife as an extension of 54th Avenue East at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 5. Immediately north of the interchange, SR 99 turns east onto Pacific Highway and passes the Emerald Queen Casino, a gambling and hotel facility operated by the Puyallup Tribe, and a commercial district at the outskirts of Fife. The highway makes a gradual turn to the north, parallel to Interstate 5 and the West Fork of Hylebos Creek, and enters Milton. SR 99 travels north along a ridge and crosses into King County, turning northeast and entering the city of Federal Way. The road cuts through a forested part of the Hylebos basin near West Hylebos Wetlands Park and reaches a commercial district surrounding Kitts Corner.

At Kitts Corner, the highway intersects the western section of State Route 18, which continues east to an interchange with I-5 and onto a freeway traveling towards Auburn and Covington. SR 99 continues due north through Federal Way&#x27;s main commercial strip and passing Celebration Park, The Commons at Federal Way, and Steel Lake. The highway gains a set of high-occupancy vehicle lanes that are also open to right turns into parking lots and side streets. From northern Federal Way to the Redondo area of Des Moines, SR 99 is concurrent with SR 509, which continues southwest to Dash Point State Park and northwest to downtown Des Moines, for .

The two highways pass Saltwater State Park and the former Midway landfill before splitting near Highline College at an intersection with Kent Des Moines Road (SR 516). SR 99 then enters the city of SeaTac and continues north as International Boulevard, passing a federal detention center and light rail station on the southwest side of Angle Lake. The highway runs along the east side of Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and its expressway, serving the airport&#x27;s terminals, parking garage, light rail station, and nearby hotels. SR 99 terminates at an interchange with SR 518 in southern Tukwila, near the airport&#x27;s consolidated rental car facility and the Tukwila light rail station. A section of International Boulevard in Tukwila forms the gap between the two segments of SR 99.

===Seattle and Aurora Avenue===
SR 99 resumes at the north end of Tukwila International Boulevard and supersedes SR 599, a short freeway connecting to I-5, near the Duwamish River. The freeway travels northwest along the river&#x27;s west bank through an industrial area that faces Boeing Field. It then enters the city of Seattle and intersects the Des Moines Memorial Drive in the South Park neighborhood before the freeway ends. At an interchange with SR 509, SR 99 turns north and travels across the Duwamish River on the First Avenue South Bridge, a pair of bascule bridges that form a continuation of the SR 509 freeway.

At the north end of the bridge, SR 99 turns northwest onto East Marginal Way South and travels through Seattle&#x27;s industrial neighborhood along the east bank of the Duwamish Waterway. The six-lane street turns north and passes a cement factory before transforming into a four-lane freeway at an interchange with the West Seattle Freeway on the east end of the West Seattle Bridge. SR 99 widens to six lanes, including a northbound bus lane, and passes through the SoDo neighborhood as the dividing line between the Port of Seattle&#x27;s container ship terminals to the west and industrial businesses to the east beyond a rail terminal. The freeway passes the corporate headquarters of Starbucks and Coast Guard Station Seattle before turning northeast to reach the southern portal of the Alaskan Way Tunnel near Lumen Field and T-Mobile Park. The tunnel portal includes ramps to and from nearby streets, including Dearborn Street, Alaskan Way, and a frontage road along the east side of the highway.

The tunnel travels under Downtown Seattle and carries SR 99 along the central waterfront, running roughly parallel to the former Alaskan Way Viaduct. It is arranged with two stacked decks, carrying two lanes of southbound traffic on the upper deck and two lanes of northbound traffic on the lower deck. SR 99 emerges from the tunnel on the north side of Denny Way and travels onto Aurora Avenue North through the South Lake Union neighborhood, located to the east of the Seattle Center and the Space Needle. Aurora Avenue continues north as a six-lane street with bus lanes and a median barrier that restricts access from side streets to right-in/right-out. The highway runs along the eastern slope of Queen Anne Hill, above the Westlake neighborhood along Lake Union, to the Lake Washington Ship Canal.

Aurora Avenue then crosses the ship canal on the George Washington Memorial Bridge (commonly known as the Aurora Bridge), a steel cantilever arch bridge with a clearance of . The bridge has six lanes and no median barrier, which resumes after an interchange with Bridge Way on the north approach, which crosses over the Fremont Troll. The highway continues north through part of Fremont and intersects North 46th Street before entering Woodland Park. SR 99 forms the boundary between Woodland Park to the east and the Woodland Park Zoo to the west and passes under a series of three pedestrian overpasses. The highway turns northeast to follow the shore of Green Lake and passes through the residential districts of Phinney Ridge and Greenwood, where traffic signals replace the medians and right-in/right-out access. SR 99 passes west of the North Seattle College campus in Licton Springs and intersects Northgate Way, a major street that provides access to Northgate Mall. Aurora Avenue then bisects the Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park, the city&#x27;s largest cemetery, and passes between Haller Lake and Bitter Lake before reaching the northern city boundary at North 145th Street (SR 523).

===Shoreline and Snohomish County===

SR 99 enters Shoreline and passes through the city&#x27;s main commercial district, running parallel to the Interurban Trail. The stretch of Aurora Avenue through Shoreline has a landscaped median, plant buffers for sidewalks, several left-turn pockets, and an overpass for the Interurban Trail. Near Shorewood High School and the Shoreline city hall, the highway is flanked to the east by the Interurban Trail and a park with a preserved section of the original North Trunk Road, which was paved in red bricks. After passing Echo Lake and the Aurora Village shopping center, SR 99 reaches an interchange with SR 104 near the boundary between King and Snohomish counties. The highway intersects SR 104 Spur on the county line itself, which lies south of the interchange.

After the interchange, the highway turns northeast and runs through a predominantly commercial area of Edmonds, passing east of the Swedish Medical Center&#x27;s Edmonds campus and west of Hall Creek and the Interurban Trail. SR 99 continues northeast into Lynnwood and passes the Edmonds College campus before reaching the Crossroads commercial district at a junction with 196th Street Southwest (SR 524). The highway runs along the city&#x27;s retail strip and through its international district (also described as a Koreatown), which is surrounded by apartments and homes that are set back from SR 99.

Beyond the city limits of Lynnwood, SR 99 enters an unincorporated area near Lake Serene. The highway intersects SR 525 at a partial cloverleaf interchange and crosses Airport Road, which provides access to Paine Field and its passenger terminal. The highway travels north into Everett on Evergreen Way and turns northeast onto Everett Mall Way in the Fairmont neighborhood. SR 99 then passes through several residential subdivisions and reaches the Everett Mall, where it turns north and terminates at the Broadway Interchange. The interchange includes connections to I-5, the Boeing Freeway (SR 526), and SR 527. The road itself continues north towards Downtown Everett as Broadway.

==History==

===Pacific Highway and U.S. Route 99===

SR 99 was created from the remnants of US 99, a national highway which spanned Western Washington from the Oregon border in Vancouver to the Canadian border at the Peace Arch in Blaine. US 99 itself was preceded by a century-old network of military roads, wagon roads, and auto trails that were built across the state in the 19th century and early 20th century until it was formally incorporated into the state highway system.

In southern King County, modern-day SR 99 runs parallel to a section of the Fort Steilacoom–Fort Bellingham military road, constructed in the 1850s by the U.S. Army. A section north of Seattle follows the R.F. Morrow wagon road, constructed in 1901 and later incorporated into the North Trunk Road. The North Trunk Road was completed from Seattle to the area east of Edmonds in August 1912 and initially paved with bricks. The Seattle–Everett Interurban Railway was also built along sections of the wagon road in 1906 and would serve Everett–Seattle traffic until 1939.

The Pacific Highway, an inter-state coastal highway, was championed by good roads advocates in the early 1910s and added to the state highway system in 1913. It originally followed the Puyallup and Green rivers from Tacoma to Renton and the Bothell–Everett Highway (now SR 527) along North Creek in Snohomish County. The highway was designated as State Road 1 in 1923, a number that it would retain after the creation of Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) in 1937. The Pacific Highway was incorporated into the new national numbered highway system in 1926 as US 99, connecting the three West Coast states and running from the Mexican border to Canada. The Bothell route was bypassed by a newer and straighter highway to the west that opened on October 9, 1927, shortening the distance from Seattle to Everett by and featuring overpasses for the existing interurban and a gravel median strip in some sections. It was built by the state government in tandem with a set of new bridges connecting Everett to Marysville and cost $645,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct and partially pave. The White River route was bypassed in early 1928 by the Highline route, which traveled along the western plateau near Des Moines. The new highway cost $3 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to construct and pave and reduced the distance to Tacoma by .

US 99 was originally routed north from Downtown Seattle on 4th Avenue, Westlake Avenue, 7th Avenue, and Dexter Avenue, crossing the Lake Washington Ship Canal on the Fremont Bridge before continuing onto Fremont Avenue. A high-level crossing of the Ship Canal to replace the existing drawbridges was proposed in the 1920s as the &quot;final link&quot; in the Pacific Highway. The bridge was funded by the state, county, and municipal governments and approved for construction in 1927. Construction on the bridge began in 1929 and was completed on February 22, 1932, during a dedication ceremony that named it the George Washington Memorial Bridge. The bridge was sited on Aurora Avenue, which was expanded into a limited-access expressway that extended south to Denny Way and north through Woodland Park to North 65th Street. The expressway on the north side of the bridge was completed in May 1933 after a public debate over its routing through Woodland Park, which was opposed by &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; and conservationists. The debate was settled after the passing of a city council ordinance in June 1930 and a ballot measure in November that approved the through-park route.

===Viaduct and expressway construction===

Within Downtown Seattle, US 99 was routed along 4th Avenue, connecting to the north with the Aurora Avenue expressway via 7th Avenue and to the south with East Marginal Way near Boeing Field. An alternate route was designated in the early 1950s along 1st Avenue, rejoining the highway in Georgetown. Congestion and difficulty in directing freight trucks through downtown led to proposals for a bypass route for US 99 as early as 1928 along Railroad Avenue on the city&#x27;s waterfront. Railroad Avenue, later renamed Alaskan Way, was rebuilt in the 1930s as part of the federal government&#x27;s improvements to the city seawall and became the primary bypass route for through traffic, experiencing major congestion as a result.

Formal proposals to build &quot;motor viaducts&quot; bypassing the city along Alaskan Way were submitted by the city engineering department in 1937 and supported by automobile and traffic safety groups. The bypass viaduct gained popularity following the end of World War II and engineering work was approved in 1947, with construction funds sourced from the city and the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944. A double-deck elevated design was chosen to accommodate the six lanes that would displace railroads along the east side of Alaskan Way. Construction on the Alaskan Way Viaduct began on February 6, 1950, and the first section between Railroad Way and Elliott Avenue opened to traffic on April 4, 1953. It cost approximately $8 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars), using pile-driven columns and a pair of moving gantry cranes to lift sections of the roadway from street level.

The Battery Street Tunnel, connecting the viaduct with the Aurora Avenue expressway, was opened to traffic on July 24, 1954, and cost $2.8 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars). A extension of the viaduct, linking south to a surface freeway and US 99 at East Marginal Way, cost $7.6 million to construct (equivalent to $ in dollars) and opened on September 3, 1959. The southern extension eased congestion at the Railroad Way terminus and was used by a daily average of 25,000 vehicles within days of opening and 37,000 vehicles by the end of the year. A series of ramps connecting the viaduct to the Spokane Street Viaduct were completed in January 1960, followed by a downtown offramp to Seneca Street in November 1961 and onramp from Columbia Street in February 1966. The state government had prepared to build a set of ramps from the viaduct to US 10 (later part of I-90) near Connecticut Street, but plans for the freeway were delayed in the 1960s and eventually abandoned, leaving the ramps unused.

The viaduct was initially signed as part of U.S. Route 99 Alternate and US 99 Bypass until 1959, when US 99 was formally switched to the viaduct after the completion of the southern extension. 4th Avenue was signed as a business route of US 99 and also carried a section of US 10 to its terminus at the north end of the Battery Street Tunnel. The East Marginal Way route through the Boeing Field area was heavily congested due to traffic heading to Boeing facilities, leading to proposals in the 1950s to build a new expressway on the west side of the Duwamish River. Construction of the two-lane West Marginal Way expressway began in November 1958 and was completed in July 1959, including grade-separated interchanges and bridges at South 118th Street, 14th Avenue South, and South Cloverdale Street. The expressway split from US 99 at South 118th Street and connected to 1st Avenue at the south end of the viaduct using the First Avenue South Bridge, which opened in 1956 with the intent of becoming part of US 99. In March 1959, the state government approved $3 million in funds (equivalent to $ in dollars) for an expansion project that would widen the West Marginal Way expressway to four lanes. The expansion was completed in 1968, and was signed as US 99 Temporary and later State Route 99T after the 1964 state highway renumbering.

The state legislature authorized planning of a tolled expressway from Tacoma to Everett in 1953, with the intent of building a grade-separated bypass of US 99. The tollway plan was superseded three years later by the Interstate Highway Program, which was authorized by the federal government and included a north–south freeway through the Seattle area replacing US 99. The route was designated as Interstate 5 in 1957 and planning for the Seattle Freeway began at the same time using federal funds.

The first section of the Tacoma–Seattle–Everett freeway to be built was in southern Tacoma and was opened to traffic in October 1959. The Tacoma sections opened in October 1962 from the Puyallup River to the Kent–Des Moines Road (now SR 516) in Midway, and in October 1964 in downtown Tacoma. Construction of the Seattle section began in 1958 with work on the Ship Canal Bridge, which was opened to traffic on December 18, 1962. The northern approach to Downtown Seattle was opened the following August to coincide with the completion of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and SR 520. A section of the freeway traveling from North Seattle to southern Snohomish County and Everett was opened to traffic on February 3, 1965. The freeway connecting Midway to the south side of Downtown Seattle was opened on January 31, 1967, completing the final section of the urban freeway. I-5 itself was completed two years later with the opening of the section between Everett and Marysville on May 14, 1969.

The state government introduced a new highway numbering system in 1964 to align with the Interstates and prepare for the decommissioning of U.S. routes. PSH 1 was replaced with US 99, which remained as a temporary designation on various freeway sections until I-5 was fully completed. US 99 was decommissioned at a meeting of the American Association of State Highway Officials on June 24, 1969, shortly after the full completion of I-5 within Washington state. While most US 99 signs were removed, an overhead sign in Downtown Seattle at the Columbia Street onramp to the Alaskan Way Viaduct remained until the viaduct was demolished in 2019.

During the 1970 codification of the new highway system, the state legislature created State Route 99 (SR 99) to delay transferring ownership and maintenance of the highway to local jurisdictions. SR 99 was created from a section of US 99 that ran from Fife to the Broadway Interchange in Everett, and was retained as a permanent addition to the state highway system in 1971 due to the corridor&#x27;s importance to state affairs. A provision in the 1971 law allows for the abandonment of the Fife–Federal Way section of SR 99 after the completion of the SR 509 freeway extension. Instead of continuing north into Everett on Evergreen Way, SR 99 was routed northeasterly on Everett Mall Way, a section of the Broadway Cut-off (also named Diagonal Way) that opened in June 1954.

===Street and bridge improvements===
Sections of SR 99 in North Seattle along Aurora Avenue and in South King County declined economically after the opening of Interstate 5, losing businesses amid increased crime. It became a notorious haven for drug dealers, prostitutes, the homeless, and strip clubs by the 1970s and 1980s. The stretch from Federal Way to Tukwila in South King County, popularly known as the &quot;SeaTac Strip&quot;, was where the Green River Killer (Gary Ridgway) picked up many of his victims in the 1980s. The highway was also unsafe for pedestrians and cross-traffic due to the lack of crossings and improper management of utility lines and overgrown foliage.

In an effort to clean up sections of the corridor, various cities have undertaken reconstruction projects in the 1990s and 2000s to turn the highway into a landscaped boulevard. In southern King County, the cities of Federal Way, SeaTac, and Tukwila drew up redevelopment plans that were largely built out in the 2000s, reducing traffic collisions and crime while improving the area&#x27;s appearance. After being denied permission to plant trees along SR 99, the city of Tukwila requested control of the highway within its city limits and was granted a jurisdictional transfer in 2004 by the state legislature, allowing them to redevelop of International Boulevard into a new street with traffic calming features.

The city of Shoreline was incorporated in 1995 and made the redevelopment of Aurora Avenue into an early priority, completing its $140 million modernization and multi-use trail project in stages between 2008 and 2017. The project included new traffic signals, BAT lanes, underground utility lines, and two pedestrian bridges. Edmonds plans to add widened sidewalks with planted buffer zones, new crosswalks, and turn lane pockets to its section of SR 99 beginning in 2022. The city of Seattle also plans to improve its section of Aurora Avenue North, but funding shortages and the timing of WSDOT repaving projects have led to a lack of sidewalks along some sections of the street. The Move Ahead Washington package, passed in 2022, includes $50 million in funds to rebuild sections of Aurora Avenue to include sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and landscaping.

The Aurora Bridge, part of the expressway linking Aurora Avenue to downtown Seattle, was the site of frequent suicide jumps until a set of emergency phones and new fences were installed in 2011 at a cost of $4.6 million to deter would-be jumpers. The bridge and its expansion joints underwent a major seismic retrofit that was completed in 2012 at a cost of $5.7 million; the retrofit was followed by a repainting and repaving project that was completed in two stages between 2016 and 2018 at a cost of $35 million. On September 24, 2015, a collision between an amphibious Duck tour vehicle and a charter bus on the Aurora Bridge killed four people and injured 50 more. The incident raised questions regarding the safety of Aurora Bridge, which lacks a median barrier and is the narrowest six-lane bridge in the state, with a lane width of . Other sections of Aurora Avenue were retrofitted to install median barriers in 1973, and the state government considered a 2003 plan to put barriers on the bridge and relocate the sidewalks to compensate for the additional weight but ultimately deferred any improvements. In the aftermath of the crash and its three-year-long court case, WSDOT and the Seattle Department of Transportation have disagreed over whether to install a center barrier or median zipper system, and which agency would be responsible for funding either option.

===Viaduct replacement and tunnel project===
====Proposals and earthquake studies====
Proposals to replace the Alaskan Way Viaduct date back to the 1970s during attempts to revitalize the city&#x27;s waterfront for tourism and recreation rather than traditional industrial uses. A similar double-decker freeway, the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland, California, collapsed during the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and killed 42 people, leading to intensified calls to replace the viaduct due to the realized earthquake risk. A 1995 study commissioned by the state government after the Kobe earthquake found vulnerabilities in the Alaskan Way Viaduct&#x27;s design that could cause severe damage and collapse during a major earthquake, along with liquefaction risks due to the underlying reclaimed land that the highway was built on. The study estimated that it would cost $118 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to demolish the viaduct, $344 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to retrofit the structure for earthquake resistance, and $530 million (equivalent to $ in dollars) to build a new elevated freeway to replace it; other options included replacing the freeway with a tunnel or a surface boulevard with public transit on Alaskan Way, similar to San Francisco&#x27;s Embarcadero.

On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually earthquake struck the Seattle area with strong shaking that caused signs of visible damage on the Alaskan Way Viaduct. The freeway was shut down for inspections, which found small cracks and other minor damage to non-structural elements that allowed it to reopen within 26 hours. Four more closures were ordered later in March and April due to pieces of concrete dropping onto the streets below, requiring emergency repairs to add steel rods to reinforce the columns. The first repairs were completed in November at a cost of $1.8 million and a set of new vehicle weight restrictions were implemented; in total, $14.5 million was spent on various repairs due to earthquake damage. Annual inspections and continued monitoring found that the earthquake had caused settling of up to into the soil and weakened connections between the columns and highway decks. Additional investigations also found unrelated damage to the underlying seawall, which would need to be rebuilt to prevent a resulting collapse of the viaduct.

An ongoing state study investigating a viaduct replacement strategy was accelerated by the state legislature using $5 million in funds, while a separate engineering study suggested immediate demolition of the structure due to a 1-in-20 chance of collapse in an earthquake within the next decade. In late 2001, WSDOT began work on an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the viaduct replacement project using emergency funds from the state legislature and consulted the city government and community leaders to generate concepts. By the following year, a set of 76 concepts organized into four general alternatives were presented for public feedback. Among the options were an elevated freeway similar to the current viaduct and several tunnel concepts, including a bored tunnel, a two-level cut-and-cover tunnel, and a mined tunnel carrying one direction of traffic. Five finalist options were paired with the seawall replacement and evaluated in June 2002, with costs ranging from $3.5 billion for a rebuilt viaduct to $8.8–$11.6 billion for various tunnel designs.

====Tunnel concept, advisory votes, and subprojects====
The tunnel plan was endorsed by WSDOT and the city council based on public support for waterfront revitalization, but design changes would be needed to bring down its cost. After voters rejected a statewide gas tax referendum that would have funded a portion of the project&#x27;s cost, WSDOT and the city government drafted new cost-saving concepts for a shorter tunnel and a surface boulevard that were included in the five options evaluated by the draft EIS in 2004. The six-lane, $4 billion tunnel option was chosen as the preferred alternative by WSDOT in late 2004, despite backlash from activists groups who favored a rebuilt viaduct or a waterfront boulevard.

The state legislature passed an $8.5 billion gas tax program in 2005, allocating $2 billion in funding for the viaduct replacement. A supplemental EIS was prepared in 2006 to include new project requirements for the Battery Street Tunnel area and evaluate the cut-and-cover tunnel and elevated options. A pair of advisory, non-binding ballot measures was held in March 2007 to find a consensus between the $2.8 billion elevated replacement supported by Governor Christine Gregoire and a smaller four-lane tunnel with surface public transit improvements that would cost $3.4 billion and was supported by Mayor Greg Nickels; Nickel&#x27;s &quot;hybrid tunnel&quot; proposal was rejected by Gregoire and state legislators prior to the vote based on operational and safety problems identified by WSDOT. Both options were rejected by voters, with 70 percent opposed to the tunnel and 55 percent opposed to the elevated concept.

The governments of Washington state, King County, and Seattle agreed to re-evaluate the planning process for the viaduct replacement and split the main proposals from essential safety and traffic improvements that would be included in all alternatives. A $915 million package of projects was approved for immediate construction, beginning with work to strengthen sinking columns in late 2007 and repairs to the Battery Street Tunnel the following year. Although the column strengthening project was declared successful, further inspections found that the Columbia Street onramp had sunk an additional during the nearby construction. The southernmost stretch of the viaduct, between Holgate and King streets, was demolished in October 2011 and replaced with a six-lane elevated freeway that opened the following year at a cost of $115 million. Seattle voters approved a bond measure in 2012 to replace the Alaskan Way Seawall; the project began construction in 2013 and was completed in 2017 at a cost of $410 million, running 21 percent overbudget.

====Deep-bored tunnel approved and contested====

The state government announced a new timeline for the project in January 2008, with Governor Gregoire declaring her intention to demolish the viaduct by 2012 regardless of Seattle&#x27;s approval. Eight new concepts for a four-lane replacement were developed by June from a set of priorities developed for SR 99, I-5, and public transit in downtown. The eight options included two surface boulevards with transit improvements, a one-way couplet, a set of two elevated freeways, an elevated freeway with a rooftop park, and three tunnels: a cut-and-cover tunnel, a lidded trench, and a deep-bored tunnel. Several early concepts, including a bridge across Elliott Bay and a complete rebuild of the double-decked viaduct, were rejected by the panel of public officials. The final decision was delayed until after the gubernatorial election, but would have to meet an end-of-year deadline imposed by the state legislature. In December 2008, two finalists were chosen for further study and consideration by the state legislature: a $2.3 billion elevated freeway and the $2.2 billion surface-transit option.

While the deep-bored tunnel was not chosen as one of the two finalists, it remained popular with tunnel activists and was considered separately due to its $4.25 billion cost (equivalent to $ in dollars). On January 13, 2009, Governor Gregoire signed an agreement with Mayor Nickels and King County Executive Ron Sims to ratify the deep-bored tunnel as the replacement for the Alaskan Way Viaduct, to be completed by 2015. $2.8 billion would be covered by state gas taxes and federal funds, leaving a $1.4 billion shortfall to be filled by the local government and potential tolls. The state legislature passed a bill in April 2009 to commit $2.8 billion in state funding for the tunnel project, which Governor Gregoire signed the following month. In total, more than 90 alternatives were considered before the final agreement was reached in 2009.

The tunnel project received $300 million in funds from the Port of Seattle in exchange for design input on the surface boulevard that would replace Alaskan Way. Neighborhood and environmental activist Mike McGinn was elected mayor in 2009, largely on an anti-tunnel platform, and threatened to veto project agreements until the state took responsibility for cost overruns that would fall upon Seattle. The city council approved a non-binding resolution to authorize the tunnel project, pending the outcome of contract bidding, which was completed in December 2010 with the selection of Seattle Tunnel Partners (STP), a consortium led by Dragados USA. STP presented a $1.09 billion plan to use a tunnel boring machine, the world&#x27;s widest, to complete the tunnel by late 2015. WSDOT signed the tunnel construction contract in January 2011, sending a set of contractor agreements to the city council for approval.

The state&#x27;s agreements were approved by the city council in February 2011, shortly before being symbolically vetoed by Mayor McGinn; the veto was overridden by the end of the month—the 10th anniversary of the Nisqually earthquake—with an 8–1 city council majority. McGinn joined other tunnel opposition groups to file a referendum questioning whether the city council had the authority to approve the state and federal agreements. The referendum was initially blocked by a lawsuit filed by the city, but was approved and placed on the August 2011 ballot by a county judge. The referendum was approved by 58 percent of voters on August 16, 2011, authorizing the city&#x27;s agreements with WSDOT. The Federal Highway Administration completed its analysis of the project&#x27;s final EIS and issued its record of decision with WSDOT later that month, allowing pre-construction activities to begin.

====Tunnel boring and viaduct closure====

After the demolition of the viaduct&#x27;s southernmost stretch and its lanes were realigned onto an adjacent bypass in 2012, crews began excavation of a launch pit to house the tunnel boring machine. Local officials, with the notable absence of Mayor Mike McGinn, participated in a ceremonial groundbreaking was held for the tunnel on June 20, 2012. The tunnel boring machine was manufactured by Hitachi Zosen in Osaka, Japan, and named &quot;Bertha&quot; in honor of Mayor Bertha Knight Landes. Bertha arrived in Seattle on April 2, 2013, and its 40 pieces were assembled in the launch pit before tunnel boring began on July 30—setting a record for the world&#x27;s largest tunnel boring machine.

Tunnel boring was halted at near South Main Street in December 2013 after the machine encountered an unknown object that caused it to overheat. The object was found to be a steel pipe and well casing that was left behind by a groundwater research crew for the project in 2002. The pipe caused extensive damage to Bertha&#x27;s cutterhead and main bearing seal, requiring the excavation of a rescue pit for repairs. Bertha reached the completed excavation pit in March 2015 and the machine&#x27;s front end was disassembled and lifted to the surface to repair the damage, which was found to be more extensive than previously thought.

The repaired cutterhead was lowered into the access pit in August 2015 and tunnel boring resumed on December 22, 2015, reaching past the pit the following month. During the two-year halt in tunnel boring, public officials considered alternative plans to accelerate demolition of the viaduct while awaiting tunnel completion. The project was named one of the worst boondoggles in the United States by several transportation groups and critics, due in part to the stoppage and its high cost. Tunnel boring was halted by Governor Jay Inslee in January 2016 due to the appearance of a sinkhole in Pioneer Square, but resumed the following month. The machine passed under the Alaskan Way Viaduct in April 2016, requiring a closure while the structure was monitored for movement, and reached the halfway mark in October. Bertha completed its bore on April 4, 2017, arriving at the north portal near Aurora Avenue for disassembly, which was completed in August. The tunnel portals and their maintenance areas were completed while work on the double-decker freeway inside the tunnel progressed behind the machine.

The Alaskan Way Viaduct permanently closed on January 11, 2019, beginning a three-week realignment of ramps at the portals as ramps were prepared for the opening of the tolled downtown tunnel on February 4, 2019. The remaining section of the viaduct was demolished in stages between February and November 2019, with some of the of rubble deposited into the Battery Street Tunnel as it was filled and sealed. A three-block section of Aurora Avenue between Denny Way and the new tunnel portal was raised and reconnected to cross-streets in 2019. The Alaskan Way promenade and boulevard project is planned to cost $668 million and will be completed in 2024. The new boulevard will be eight lanes wide in some sections due to requirements placed by WSDOT for Colman Dock access and the Port of Seattle for truck access. The viaduct replacement megaproject is estimated to cost $3.3 billion, with $200 million of construction costs and additional funds for ongoing maintenance to be raised through tunnel tolls that began to be collected on November 9, 2019.

===Future projects===

In 2022, community activists from the South Park neighborhood proposed removing a freeway section of SR 99 between SR 599 and SR 509 to improve local air quality. A federal grant was announced the following year to study the impact of a possible removal or redesign of the highway through South Park.

==Names and designations==
The name of SR 99 differs from city to city, with several sections named the Pacific Highway and International Boulevard, a moniker invented by SeaTac for the 1990 Goodwill Games hosted by King County. In Seattle, the highway is known as East Marginal Way and Aurora Avenue North; in Everett, it uses Evergreen Way and Everett Mall Way. A four-block section of former SR 99 between Denny Way and the new tunnel portal was renamed to 7th Avenue North and Borealis Avenue in early 2019 as part of the reconfiguration of Aurora Avenue.

The United Daughters of the Confederacy unsuccessfully lobbied the state legislature in 1939 to designate the entirety of US 99 within the state as part of the national &quot;Jefferson Davis Highway&quot;. A pair of granite markers were installed the following year in Blaine and Vancouver to commemorate the highway, allegedly to recognize Davis&#x27;s contributions to the territorial development of Washington as U.S. Secretary of War. The two markers were removed in 1998 and 2002, and are now located at the privately owned Jefferson Davis Park in Ridgefield.

The State House of Representatives unanimously approved a bill in 2002 that would have removed Davis&#x27; name from the road, but it was deferred by a State Senate committee. The attempted renaming, led by Snohomish representative Hans Dunshee, generated political controversy and death threats against legislators from people opposed to the bill. The bill was revived in May 2016 and was passed unanimously by both houses of the legislature, renaming SR 99 for William P. Stewart, an African-American Civil War veteran and early settler in Snohomish. New highway signs for the William P. Stewart Memorial Highway were installed the following year, amid a new wave of Confederate monument removals.

==Public transit==
SR 99 is a major regional public transit corridor and carries several bus rapid transit routes and a light rail line in SeaTac. The highway features bus lanes and business access and transit lanes (BAT lanes) in several locations to give buses traffic priority while retaining access to right turns.

Pierce Transit route 500 runs on the SR 99 and Pacific Highway corridor between Tacoma Dome Station and Federal Way Transit Center. Through Federal Way and SeaTac, the highway is served by the RapidRide A Line, an rapid bus route that debuted in 2010 and features enhanced bus stops and transit signal priority. Sound Transit&#x27;s Link light rail trains on the 1 Line run along elevated tracks above or near SR 99 from Angle Lake station to Tukwila International Boulevard station at the SR 518 interchange. The Alaskan Way Viaduct carried several non-stop routes connecting Downtown Seattle to West Seattle (including the RapidRide C Line) and Burien.

Aurora Avenue is served by the RapidRide E Line, which carried 18,000 passengers daily in 2017 and is the busiest bus route in the King County Metro system. The E Line debuted in 2014, replacing Route 358—itself the successor to Route 359, which was retired in 1999 after a Metro bus was involved in a shooting and crashed off the Aurora Bridge. The E Line terminates in Downtown Seattle and near the county line at the Aurora Village Transit Center, where Community Transit&#x27;s route 101 and Swift Blue Line begins. Swift features off-board fare payment and longer spacing between stops, and runs from Shoreline to Everett Station via Evergreen Way. The Everett Mall Way section of SR 99 is served by Everett Transit route 7, which connects the Everett Mall to Downtown Everett and Everett Station.

<doc id="626353" wikidata="Q2333456" url="?curid=626353" title="Spider-Man (1967 TV series)">
<text>Spider-Man is a 1967 Canadian-American superhero animated television series that was the first television series based on the Spider-Man comic book series created by writer Stan Lee and by artist Steve Ditko. It was jointly produced in Canada (animation for season 1 and voice acting for all seasons) and the United States (animation for seasons 2 and 3). The show starred Paul Soles as the voice of Peter Parker, also known as Spider-Man. The first two seasons aired on the ABC television network, and the third was distributed in syndication. Grantray-Lawrence Animation produced the first season, and seasons two and three were produced by Krantz Films in New York City. The series aired Saturday mornings from September 9, 1967 to June 14, 1970.

The series gained a variety of internet memes and is also remembered for its theme song containing the iconic phrase &quot;Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can.&quot;

==Synopsis==
The series revolved around teenager Peter Parker, a high school student who develops extraordinary strength and spider-like powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Parker decides to become a crime-fighting, costumed superhero, but must deal with family tragedies, personal problems and the insecurity of youth. As Spider-Man, Parker risks his life to fight super-powered criminals such as Doctor Octopus, Mysterio and the Green Goblin. Peter is also a freelance photographer for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, but editor J. Jonah Jameson considers Spider-Man a criminal and writes front-page headlines critical of his activities.

The first season dealt primarily with Peter&#x27;s job at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, focusing on his relationship with Jameson, his romance with receptionist Betty Brant, and often being called into action as his alter ego. Peter&#x27;s life, apart from the &quot;Bugle&quot; office and his Aunt May&#x27;s Forest Hills home, was rarely dealt with in early episodes. Although he was never seen at college, he would sometimes visit professors he knew (such as the opening of &quot;Sub-Zero for Spidey,&quot; when he went to see Doctor Smartyr). Peter&#x27;s character (blue suit, yellow vest, white shirt and red tie) was designed by Steve Ditko and art consultant John Romita Sr.

Season one&#x27;s stories mainly involved classic Spider-Man villains from the comic-book series, whose captures were often accompanied by a note signed by &quot;your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.&quot; Stan Lee was the story consultant for this season. Seasons two and three, produced by Ralph Bakshi, almost entirely eliminated villains from the comic book as a cost-cutting measure in favor of generic, green-skinned, magical monsters; this enabled the reuse of stock footage from &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot;, another animated series produced by Bakshi.

==Production==
===Budget===
Because of the show&#x27;s limited budget, Spider-Man&#x27;s costume only has webbed areas on his head, arms and boots; the rest is plain, except for the spiders on his chest and back. The series relied on reused stock animation, including Spider-Man swinging across the New York City skyline and Peter removing his shirt to reveal his spider suit. Character movement was also minimized.

The second and third seasons were produced on a reduced budget by Krantz Films under Ralph Bakshi. The cost-cutting is most apparent in the third season, with two episodes reusing almost all the footage from two &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot; episodes (notably the season-three &quot;Rocket Robin Hood&quot; episode, &quot;Dementia 5&quot;) and remaking previous episodes with minimal changes.

Several stories during this time were written by noted science fiction/fantasy author Lin Carter.

An error in Spider-Man&#x27;s costume appeared throughout season one, with the spider on his costume having only six legs. By season two, new drawings of the costume showed an eight-legged spider, but reused footage from season one continued that season&#x27;s error.

The second- and third-season episodes had a darker tone, with dark-colored settings, psychedelic images and atmospheric music. Bakshi explored Peter&#x27;s everyday life as a soft-spoken college student, such as his failure to make the football team in &quot;Criminals in the Clouds&quot; and becoming a star pitcher for the baseball team in &quot;Diamond Dust.&quot; He dated a variety of women who were either concealing secrets (&quot;Home&quot;) or waited angrily for him while Spider-Man saved the city from destruction (&quot;Swing City&quot;). Peter&#x27;s most consistent love interest was Susan Shaw, who first appeared in &quot;Criminals in the Clouds&quot; and continued to appear in season-two and -three episodes, even though her appearance changed from episode to episode. Bakshi provided the first origin story for Spider-Man presented on television, &quot;The Origin of Spider-Man,&quot; which actually used chunks of Stan Lee&#x27;s dialogue from &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #1 - specifically, &quot;In the Beginning,&quot; published in July 1968, a few months before the episode aired.

===Music===
The show&#x27;s theme song has become a popular standard. Its lyrics were written by Academy Award winner Paul Francis Webster, with music composed by Bob Harris. It was performed by the Billy Van Singers and Laurie Bower Singers.

The catchy song is recognized by its opening line, &quot;Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can.&quot;

The 2002 and 2004 film versions included Jayce Bartok and Elyse Dinh, respectively, busking the song. Both films have the song at the end of the credits; the 2002 adaptation featured the original 1967 recording (along with a re-recording by Aerosmith on the soundtrack), and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; features a re-recording by Michael Bublé. 2007&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; features a performance of the song by a marching band at a public rally for Spider-Man. In 2014&#x27;s &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot;, Peter uses a version of the theme as his ringtone. In 2017&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot;, an orchestral version plays over the Marvel Studios title card sequence. In 2018&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, the theme is briefly played at the beginning, when the original Peter Parker says he &quot;had an excellent theme song.&quot;

The original &quot;Spider-Man&quot; theme song recording was remixed by UK-based electronic music group Apollo 440 as the theme song for the 2000 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; video game by Activision and Neversoft Entertainment.

The show&#x27;s incidental music uses jangling surf guitar, brass lines and jazzy scoring. The first season&#x27;s score was original by Ray Ellis, with season two and three utilizing other music from the KPM, Capitol, Conroy and Josef Weinberger libraries by Syd Dale, Alan Hawkshaw, Johnny Hawksworth and David Lindup. In 2002, the Winnipeg jazz rock band Volume released a CD, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Band&quot;, adapting the background music. MIDI musician Vaughn Smith (Moxxi) has also released some adaptations to YouTube and elsewhere. In 2007, the radio station WFMU did a radio show featuring songs from the cartoon alongside the original masters from KPM, later released as a podcast.

==Broadcast schedule==
&quot;Spider-Man&quot; was initially transmitted in the United States on Saturday mornings on ABC. The first episode, &quot;The Power Of Doctor Octopus&quot; / &quot;Sub-Zero For Spidey,&quot; premiered on September 9, 1967. During the first and second seasons, the show was broadcast at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. ABC&#x27;s last Saturday-morning broadcast of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was on August 30, 1969, with 39 half-hour episodes (many with two stories) aired. The show went on hiatus until the following March, when a third season began a six-month run from March 22 to September 6, 1970, on Sunday mornings at 11:30 a.m. Eastern. It was rerun in syndication in the United States during the 1970s, usually as part of local stations&#x27; after-school cartoon block. In Canada, the series aired on CTV Network affiliates on Saturday morning and other time slots during the 1970s and 1980s.

In Japan, the series was broadcast on TV Tokyo from July 23 to August 30, 1974, with an episode also aired on October 10, 1974 (episode title unknown). It was broadcast again from November 30, 1974, to March 29, 1975. Kei Tomiyama was in charge of the Japanese version voice actor. In June 1986 it was broadcast on TV Tokyo again and ended in November of the same year. The voice actor was changed to Hideyuki Tanaka. Changed to Toshiyuki Morikawa when broadcast on Sky PerfecTV! (Channel Unknown) around 2003.

In 1977, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was broadcast abroad, airing in several international markets for the first time. The Spanish and Italian versions used a different theme song, written by Erick Bulling and Santiago and sung by Chilean singer Guillermo &quot;Memo&quot; Aguirre, dubbed over the original introduction. In the Italian version, the show&#x27;s title (&quot;L&#x27;uomo Ragno&quot;) was superimposed in large yellow type over the first two shots of Spider-Man swinging through the city.

The series aired on ABC Family in 2002 as part of the network&#x27;s Memorial Day weekend-long &quot;Spidey-Mania&quot; marathon, to coincide with the release of the first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; movie. It was not seen again until another &quot;Spidey-Mania&quot; marathon in 2004, coinciding with the release of &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;, its last television appearance in the U.S.

In September 2008, the series appeared in Canada on Teletoon Retro. A French-language dub aired on Radio-Canada&#x27;s Saturday-morning lineup into the mid-2000s. Episodes of the series have been posted in the &quot;Videos&quot; section of the Marvel website, but have since been removed.

==Home video releases==
===Region 1===
A number of episodes were released on VHS during the 1980s, 1990s and the early 2000s, usually compiled with other Marvel Comics characters&#x27; cartoons.

During the Early-2000s, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released a selection of episodes as bonus features on DVDs of the 1990s animated series. The episodes on &quot;The Ultimate Villain Showdown&quot; and &quot;The Return Of The Green Goblin&quot; were mastered from pre-2004 tapes, and &quot;Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock&quot; and &quot;Daredevil Meets Spider-Man&quot; used the 2004 remastered versions.

On June 29, 2004, Buena Vista Home Entertainment released a six-disc DVD boxset titled &quot;Spider-Man: The &#x27;67 Collection&quot;; containing all 52 episodes, uncut and fully restored, and also including a booklet with an introduction by creator Stan Lee. This set has since gone out-of-print, with pre-owned copies going for high prices online today, and there are currently no plans for Marvel and Disney to re-release the set.

In 2008 and 2009, Morningstar Entertainment released a number of episodes on DVD in Canada. These were reissues (mastered from VHS and Betamax copies) of the 1985 &quot;Prism Video Marvel Video Library&quot;. Compared to the early 2000s DVDs by Disney, the video and audio quality on the Morningstar releases are poor.

===Region 2===
In April 2008, Liberation Entertainment secured the home media rights to select Marvel shows from Jetix Europe in select European territories, including &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. On November 10, the company released the first season of the series as &quot;Spider-Man: The Original &#x27;67 Series&quot; on DVD, with distribution through Lace International, due to Liberation closing their UK branch a few weeks prior in October.

Clear Vision later took over European rights and released the series in several volume sets as &quot;Classic Spider-Man&quot;. Series 1 was re-released as three single volume sets on August 24, September 14 and October 9 of 2009, with Series 2 and 3 following throughout November 2009 to May 2010. On February 21, 2011, Clear Vision released an 8-disc boxset containing all fifty-two episodes in the United Kingdom, followed with a German release a few weeks later in March.

==In popular culture==
===Comics===
During the &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; comics storyline, a variation of the TV show&#x27;s universe appears with the designation of Earth-67. The Spider-Army recruit the Spider-Man of Earth-67 in order to help fight the Inheritors.

=== Film ===
The Peter Parker / Spider-Man from the 1967 animated series (voiced by Jorma Taccone) makes cameo appearances in the animated &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; feature films. In &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, Miguel O&#x27;Hara / Spider-Man 2099 (voiced by Oscar Isaac) develops a device allowing inter-dimensional travel and goes to the &quot;beginning&quot; with the universe also being designated as Earth-67 where O’Hara encounters the local Spider-Man with footage from the episode &quot;Double Identity&quot; being used. In &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;, Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) easily avoids him in a chase scene due to his slow and stilted animation.

=== Pointing meme ===
A scene from the episode &quot;Double Identity&quot;, featuring two Spider-Men pointing at each other, has become a popular internet meme, to which the post-credit scene in &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot; references.
The same meme was parodied in &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; twice: first, for a scene where Ned Leeds tries to speak to his Peter Parker, only for all three to confusedly respond; the second time for a scene where they are trying to figure out which Peter is which for purposes of combat strategy. According to Andrew Garfield, the latter instance occurred naturally during filming, but the first instance was done at his suggestion after the production team was trying to figure out how to reference the meme. On the first day of filming &quot;No Way Home&quot;, Garfield, Tobey Maguire, and Tom Holland intentionally recreated the meme during a photoshoot: the image was released on the film&#x27;s Twitter account in February 2022 to promote the home video release and quickly went viral. The meme was included in a promotional video for Spider-Verse from the mobile game &quot;Marvel Strike Force&quot;. The meme was parodied again in &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;, where all the members of the Spider-Society are confused from Miguel when he orders them to &quot;stop Spider-Man.&quot; The meme was also used in &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; as a victory emote.

<text>The Pyrénées-Orientales department is composed of 226 communes.

Most of the territory (except for the district of Fenolheda) formed a part of the Principality of Catalonia until 1659, and Catalan is still spoken (in addition to French) by a significant minority of the population. The Catalan names of communes are taken from the &quot;Enciclopèdia catalana&quot; and are intended for comparison with the official French names: they do not indicate the current or former linguistic status of the commune.

<doc id="626389" wikidata="Q3934773" url="?curid=626389" title="Richard Bulliet">
<text>Richard W. Bulliet (born 1940) is a professor emeritus of Middle Eastern history at Columbia University who specializes in the history of Islamic society and institutions, the history of technology, and the history of the role of animals in human society.

==Early life and education==
Bulliet grew up in Illinois. He attended Harvard from which he graduated with a BA as a member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1962. He later earned both an MA in 1964 and a PhD in 1967 from Harvard as well.
==Work==
Several of his books focus on Iran but also deal with the larger Muslim world. 

His book &quot;The Camel and the Wheel&quot; (1975) brings together his interest in the histories of technology, animal domestication, and the Middle East, dealing for example with the significant military advantage early Muslim armies gained from a slight improvement in the design of cloth camel saddles. 

He would return to the history of animal domestication with his &quot;Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers: The Past and Future of Human-Animal Relationships&quot; (2005). In it, he presents the four stages of human-animal relationship history: separation (when humans began to consider themselves as fundamentally separate from animals), pre-domestication (rich in symbolic expression of animals), domestication (exploiting and taming animals for human use), and post-domestication (our current industrialized consumption and separation from domestic animals).

He has also written several novels which draw on his knowledge of international politics and the Middle East, and is a promoter of the validity of comics as an art form.

Bulliet&#x27;s commentaries and opinion pieces on the Middle East have appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;New York Times International Edition&quot;, and &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;.

It was through the connections of Bulliet to the Iranian U.N. Ambassador that Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger invited Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak at Columbia University on September 24, 2007.

== Personal life ==
He is the grandson of Clarence Joseph (&quot;C.J.&quot;) Bulliet, an art critic and journalist.

<doc id="626394" wikidata="Q10932" url="?curid=626394" title="Garrotxa">
<text>Garrotxa () is a comarca (county) in the Girona region, Catalonia, Spain. Its population in 2016 was 55,999, more than half of them in the capital city of Olot. It is roughly equivalent to the historical County of Besalú.

== Geography ==
Garrotxa borders the comarques of Ripollès, Osona, Selva, Gironès, Pla de l&#x27;Estany, Alt Empordà, and Vallespir. It includes the upper basin of the River Fluvià and the headwaters of the rivers Muga, Amer and Llémena.

From both the human point of view and that of physical geography, the comarca has a clear division into two subcomarques. Extending north from the valley of the Fluvià, is Alta Garrotxa (Upper Garrotxa), while the southern part is sometimes called the comarca of Olot, after the capital city.

The Fluvià flows toward the Mediterranean, and has a relatively small flow of water (1.07 m³/s at Olot).

The high humidity of Garrotxa contrasts with that of the neighboring comarques. Annual rainfall is over 1000 mm (about 40 inches). It is said that &quot;Si no plou a Olot, no plou enlloc&quot; (&quot;if it&#x27;s not raining in Olot, it is not raining anywhere.&quot;). Winter temperatures hover around freezing; in August, temperatures average 27.7 °C (about 80 °F). Thermal inversions are relatively common; Alta Garrotxa and Puigsacalm, particularly, have more of a mountain climate, with snowfall figuring more prominently.

Vegetation varies with the climate. Alta Garrotxa and the east part of the comarca have typically Mediterranean climate and vegetation; the rest has a sub-Mediterranean climate, tending toward an Atlantic climate in the most humid areas.

=== Volcanic zone ===
In the western part of the comarca, the land around Olot and Santa Pau contains some 40 well-preserved volcanic cones at Croscat, important flows of basaltic lava, and the volcano of Santa Margarida. This zone is protected within the 120.07 km² &quot;Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa&quot;.

The populated areas are mostly located on the plain and hillsides of Olot. A field of lava covers most of the plain (some 25 km²), and lava flows continue down the valley of the Fluvià to Sant Jaume de Llierca. Another important sector is in the tectonic valley of the River Ser, at the foot of the fault scarp of the Corb and Finestres ranges, with the volcanoes of Santa Margarida and Croscat. Lava flowed down the valley, past Sallent de Santa Pau to the Gibert mill. A third group of volcanoes lies in the Llémena river valley and the stream of Adri.
The field became active about 700,000 years ago, with the last eruption occurring 11,500 years ago. There appear to have been old eruptions around Olot, because one can find basalt boulders from the Pliocene era in the valley of the Fluvià.

In 1982, the Generalitat de Catalunya declared the zone comprising the valleys of the Fluvià and Ser and the upper part of the valleys of Aiguavella and Sant Iscle to be Natural Places of National Interest. They also declared most of the volcanic cones and the Fageda d&#x27;en Jordà (beech woods rooted in lava) to be Integral Geobotanical Reserves.

== Population and economic activity ==
9.4% of the population are engaged in agriculture and primary production, 59.4% in industry and energy, and 31.2% in the service sectors. Agricultural land has been shrinking, but Garrotxa remains the leading producer of maize. The livestock sector is actually expanding, especially pigs and cattle.

Industry, centered on Olot, Sant Joan les Fonts, and Besalú, has been generally on the rise since 1940. The most important industries are textiles, especially knitwear, the processing of locally grown food, and metallurgy. Behind these come papermaking, chemistry, and plastics.

Arts and crafts are traditional also, being the Olot Art School (Escola d&#x27;Art i Superior de Disseny d&#x27;Olot) one of the oldest ones in Catalonia.

<doc id="626401" wikidata="Q1756228" url="?curid=626401" title="Isolation (Toto album)">
<text>Isolation is the fifth studio album by American rock band Toto, released in November 1984. &quot;Isolation&quot; is the first album to feature longtime bassist Mike Porcaro, and the only album with Fergie Frederiksen as the primary vocalist. &quot;Isolation&quot; failed to achieve the popularity of its predecessor, &quot;Toto IV&quot;, although it achieved gold record status and gave the band their highest charting mainstream rock single &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; (No. 7). Relatively few songs from this album were featured in live performances after 1985&#x27;s Isolation World Tour.

==Background and recording==
While &quot;Toto IV&quot; was a massive, Grammy winning success, Toto elected not to mount a U.S. tour behind the album, a decision Steve Lukather has since regretted as a missed opportunity to become a &quot;US-arena rock band.&quot; Part of the reluctance to tour was the ongoing personal and legal drug-related problems of lead vocalist Bobby Kimball. As the band began sessions for &quot;Isolation,&quot; Kimball reportedly struggled badly with his vocals. While Kimball would argue in later years that he sang lead on all the tracks on the album, Lukather has stated that he only recorded one lead vocal, for the track &quot;Lion.&quot; Even that reportedly required weeks of work, primarily because of Kimball&#x27;s tendency to not show up for sessions and, when he did, to struggle with the vocals which were at the top of his range. Ultimately, Jeff Porcaro fired Kimball from the band. Before his firing, he did also write and record one other song, &quot;Right Part of Me&quot;, that ended up on Toto XX in 1998. He did also contribute backing vocals for 3 tracks in total on the album.

The fact the band used multiple lead vocalists on their songs, including David Paich and Lukather, mitigated some of the impact of losing their primary lead vocalist. Nonetheless, it was a significant change for the band. Over the course of the next year, Toto would focus on other projects, notably the soundtrack for the film &quot;Dune.&quot; The commercial failure of &quot;Dune&quot; served only to add insult to the injury of having lost their lead vocalist.

When the band finally began auditioning potential lead vocalists, the job was first offered to Richard Page, who ultimately declined the offer because he had a contract for his band, Mr. Mister. Lukather then wanted to offer the job to Eric Martin, later of Mr. Big, but Porcaro was interested in Fergie Frederiksen, then lead singer of the band LeRoux. The gig went to Frederiksen, who contributed not only vocals to &quot;Isolation,&quot; but co-wrote the tracks &quot;Angel Don&#x27;t Cry,&quot; &quot;Isolation,&quot; &quot;Mr. Friendly,&quot; and &quot;Change of Heart.&quot;

The first cover design for &quot;Isolation&quot; was done by David Lynch, with whom Toto had worked on &quot;Dune.&quot; Though the band reportedly spent $25,000 on the work, they were ultimately disappointed in it and did not use it. The surreal image that became the cover of &quot;Isolation&quot; was ultimately chosen by Jeff Porcaro.

While the band was proud of the finished album, Lukather has noted that it was clear &quot;Isolation&quot; did not &quot;sound like the work of the same band that had made &quot;Toto IV.&quot;&quot; Toto wanted to release the track &quot;Endless,&quot; on which Frederiksen sang lead, as the first single. However, Columbia Records opted for &quot;Stranger in Town,&quot; sung by David Paich and thought to be more similar to the hit &quot;Africa.&quot; While &quot;Stranger in Town&quot; was a Top 30 hit, it was a disappointment compared to the chart topping success of the singles from &quot;Toto IV.&quot; 
The promo music video (featuring actor Brad Dourif) for the track was, however, nominated for MTV Video of the Year.

The tour behind &quot;Isolation&quot; was disastrous; Toto had been booked into arenas based on the success of &quot;Toto IV,&quot; the 10,000-seat venues were sparsely attended and, according to Lukather, the band &quot;lost their shirts&quot; on the tour. A tour of Europe was ultimately cancelled and Toto fired their booking agents.

&quot;Isolation&quot; would eventually achieve gold status in the United States and triple platinum status in Japan, but was nonetheless seen as a commercial failure. Although Frederiksen would begin work with Toto on their sixth album, &quot;Fahrenheit,&quot; he struggled with the vocals for the first track, &quot;Could This Be Love,&quot; and the band moved on to Joseph Williams.

==Reception==
AllMusic&#x27;s retrospective review praised the performances of Jeff Porcaro, David Paich, and Steve Lukather in passing but dismissed &quot;Isolation&quot; as &quot;a Journey clone album, minus the aching ballads that had made Journey such a success.&quot;

<doc id="626407" wikidata="Q466117" url="?curid=626407" title="Tariana Turia">
<text>Dame Tariana Turia (née Woon; 8 April 1944 – 3 January 2025) was a New Zealand Māori rights activist and politician. She was first elected to Parliament in 1996 as a representative of the Labour Party. She won the Te Tai Hauāuru electorate in 2002 and broke from Labour in 2004, resigning from Parliament during the foreshore and seabed controversy. Turia returned to Parliament in the resulting by-election as the first representative of the newly formed Māori Party, which she led for the next decade.

Turia held ministerial offices across two governments. From 1999 to 2004 she was a junior minister in the health, housing and social development portfolios and the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector in the Fifth Labour Government. In the Fifth National Government, she was Minister for Whānau Ora, a health programme she initiated under a confidence and supply agreement between the National and Māori parties, and Minister for Disability Issues. Turia retired as Māori Party co-leader and a member of Parliament at the general election in September 2014.

==Early life==
Born Tariana Woon on 8 April 1944 to an American (probably Native American) father and Māori mother, Turia had iwi affiliations to Ngāti Apa, Ngā Rauru, Ngāti Tūwharetoa and Whanganui. She grew up in the small village of Pūtiki, on the Whanganui River, and was raised by a grandmother, whāngai parents and aunties. She was educated at Wanganui Girls&#x27; College, and trained as a nurse.

She married George Turia at Rātana Pā on 10 November 1962. They remained married until he died in 2019, and had four children and two whāngai, as well as numerous grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Before entering politics, she had considerable involvement with a number of Māori organisations, working with Te Puni Kōkiri (the Ministry of Māori Development) and a number of Māori health providers, including Te Oranganui Iwi Health Authority where she was chief executive. While Turia herself never learned to speak te reo Māori, she promoted language revitalisation through the kura kaupapa and kohanga reo movements. With her husband, she led a marae-based skills and employment training programme. In 1995, she was a leader of the 79-day iwi occupation of Moutoa Gardens in Whanganui, which protested unresolved issues from the European colonisation of the area. One of her sons was jailed during the protest for beheading a statue of John Ballance. Later that year, she unsuccessfully contested election to the Whanganui District Council.

==Labour Party==
Turia was a member of Parliament for the Labour Party from 12 October 1996 until her resignation on 17 May 2005. She was first elected as a list MP in the 1996 general election, ranked 20th on the party list. Her selection as a Labour candidate was controversial. She had only joined the party shortly before her selection as a candidate, although she had been asked to stand in the past. Her personal politics were decried by New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, who described her as a &quot;Māori separatist&quot;. The &quot;Evening Post&quot; described her as a &quot;young radical&quot; (Turia was then 52 years old) and as seeing herself accountable to Māori ahead of the party. Labour&#x27;s policies on Māori advancement at that election revolved around delivering targeted social services funding to Māori through the mainstream system. Turia later described Labour leader Helen Clark&#x27;s campaign opening speech as &quot;not too much out of kilter&quot; with her own views.

In her first term, Turia was appointed Labour&#x27;s spokesperson on Māori health and youth issues and sat on the Māori affairs committee. When swearing her oath of allegiance in Parliament, Turia swore allegiance to the Treaty of Waitangi rather than the Queen. In her maiden statement on 26 February 1997, she acknowledged Labour&#x27;s defeated Māori electorate candidates Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan, Peter Tapsell, Koro Wētere and Matiu Rata and asserted the following statement on tino rangatiratanga (Māori self-determination):


 
She also described non-Māori New Zealanders as &quot;tauiwi&quot; (foreigners). Of that speech, the &quot;Dominion&quot; newspaper wrote &quot;Parliament&#x27;s real radical stands up... and declined to tiptoe around Pakeha sensitivities.&quot; United New Zealand party leader Peter Dunne (also a former Labour MP) responded in &quot;The Evening Post&quot; the following month by saying Turia&#x27;s &quot;backward-looking negativism is driving a wedge between New Zealanders, regardless of their ethnic origin, and it is time it ceased.&quot; He complained to the Race Relations Conciliator. Turia received more criticism for her views when she said in 1997 that the Treaty of Waitangi was more important than the Ten Commandments. She also clashed with some long-serving MPs in her party, including Mike Moore, over their different approaches to Māori development. Turia&#x27;s outspokenness, the &quot;Dominion&quot; wrote, was a hindrance to Labour&#x27;s bid to reclaim office at the next election because her actions &quot;fed suspicions that an unacceptable radicalism persists in the party.&quot; New parties centring on Māori interests formed after the breakup of the National–New Zealand First coalition government, but Turia remained with Labour.

After losing selection in the Te Tai Hauāuru electorate to her colleague Nanaia Mahuta, Turia was re-elected as a Labour list MP in the 1999 election (ranked 16th). Mahuta changed electorates for the 2002 election; Turia won selection in Te Tai Hauāuru and the seat as an electorate-only candidate. From December 1999, she was a minister outside of Cabinet in the Fifth Labour Government. In the government&#x27;s first term, she was a Minister of State and an associate minister in the health, housing, Māori affairs, and social services portfolios. Early in her time as a minister, Turia was warned by prime minister Helen Clark about opinions she voiced on the &quot;holocaust&quot; caused to Māori by colonisation and apologised in Parliament for her statements. While she did not lose her ministerial positions, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that Turia offered her resignation over the scandal. In a subsequent speech, she set out her view that &quot;self-governance, as being the choice of self-determination, for me means the right to participate in and control the processes through which decisions that affect our lives are made.&quot; Turia championed partnership with and devolution to mana whenua in the delivery of State health and education services, but was not always successful.

In November 2000, Turia was additionally appointed as an associate minister in the corrections portfolio. The following year she attracted controversy when she advocated for prisoners known to her to have special treatment including the cancellation of a transfer, other transfers to be closer to family, a review of an inmate&#x27;s security rating, and for charges to be downgraded. She was also scrutinised for a telephone call she made to the chief judge of the Māori Land Court about a case involving one of her iwi. A twelfth case of alleged interference in prison operations was reported in early 2002. After the July 2002 general election, Turia was not reappointed in the corrections portfolio (she retained her responsibilities in health, housing, social services and Māori affairs); her spokesperson said she had offered to &quot;give up&quot; the corrections role in order to continue to advocate on behalf of her constituents. Instead, she became Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector. She launched the Office for the Community and Voluntary Sector in September 2003.

When debate about ownership of New Zealand&#x27;s foreshore and seabed broke out in 2003, and the Labour Party proposed vesting ownership in the state, Turia voiced dissatisfaction. Along with many of her supporters in Te Tai Hauāuru, she claimed that Labour&#x27;s proposal amounted to an outright confiscation of Māori land. When it became publicly known that Turia might vote against Labour&#x27;s bill in parliament, tensions between Turia and the Labour Party&#x27;s leadership increased. The hierarchy strongly implied that if Turia did not support Labour policy, she could not retain her ministerial roles. On 30 April 2004, after a considerable period of confusion about Turia&#x27;s intentions, she announced in a speech at Rātana Pā that she would resign from the Labour Party and from parliament on 17 May. Clark removed her from her ministerial roles the same day.

== Māori Party ==

Turia&#x27;s resignation from Parliament precipitated a by-election being called in Te Tai Hauāuru, which Turia contested as a member of the new Māori Party that formed around her. Her supporters saw Turia as having bravely defied her party in order to stand up for her principles. The Labour Party criticised Turia for putting the foreshore and seabed issue before the party&#x27;s wider policies for Māori development, and said that she unreasonably focused on a single issue. Helen Clark said that Turia showed &quot;an astonishing lack of perspective&quot;. Turia described the Te Tai Hauāuru by-election of 10 July 2004 as a chance to test her mandate, and to ensure that she had the support of her voters, but doubts remained about the significance of the by-election, since none of the major parties put forward candidates. Labour called the event &quot;a waste of time and money&quot;, although the by-election was required because electoral integrity legislation of the time prevented her resigning from Labour and remaining in Parliament as an independent. Turia received 92.74% of the vote in the by-election, and resumed her seat in Parliament on 27 July 2004. She voted against the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, which passed with Labour and New Zealand First&#x27;s support in November 2004.

For her efforts in splitting from Labour to establish the Māori Party, she was named political journalist John Armstrong&#x27;s 2004 politician of the year. Turia sat on the primary production committee from 13 August 2004 for the remainder of the term. Much of her political effort went into building up her new party, which she co-led alongside Pita Sharples. She also opposed the government&#x27;s campaign to immunise children against meningococcal disease. At the 2005 general election, held on 17 September, Turia was re-elected in Te Tai Hauāuru and three more Māori Party candidates won parliamentary seats: co-leader Sharples in Tāmaki Makaurau, Hone Harawira in Te Tai Tokerau and Te Ururoa Flavell in Waiariki. She pledged to repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act if her party was able to form a government but expressed a desire not to enter a coalition agreement with Labour. The Māori Party was in opposition for the term. Turia was her party&#x27;s representative on the health committee. At the end of 2005, the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot; named her as the twentieth most influential New Zealander. She delivered a keynote address at the ACT New Zealand party conference in March 2006. Later that year she drafted legislation to repeal the Foreshore and Seabed Act, although it was never debated in Parliament.

=== Supporting the Fifth National Government ===

While Turia had considered standing down at the 2008 general election, she decided to recontest her electorate. Support for the Māori Party increased with the party gaining an additional seat. National won most seats overall and agreed to form a minority government with support from the Māori Party as well as ACT New Zealand and United Future. In return for Māori Party support in confidence and supply, John Key agreed to not abolish the Māori seats without the consent of Māori. The parties also agreed to review the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 and to consider Māori representation in a wider constitutional review which began in 2010. Turia and co-leader Sharples were both made ministers outside Cabinet. Turia was reappointed Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector and also became an associate minister in the health, social development, and employment portfolios. Turia was additionally appointed Minister for Disability Issues on 30 June 2009 and Minister for Whānau Ora on 8 April 2010. After the 2011 election, in which Turia was elected for a sixth term, she was reappointed to most of her portfolios but exchanged the community portfolio to be an associate minister of housing. 

In 2010, the government announced it would replace the Foreshore and Seabed Act. Turia supported the replacement legislation, the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, although she described it as &quot;drafted by politics, rather than what is fair and moral&quot; and the party&#x27;s support for the bill led to Hone Harawira&#x27;s resignation. The replacement legislation restored access to the courts enabling iwi (tribes) and hapū (sub-tribes) to seek customary titles and Turia encouraged them to do so. The legislation was led by attorney-general Chris Finlayson, whom Turia later described as &quot;a real friend.&quot; Finlayson, in turn, described Turia as his &quot;favourite politician&quot; and dedicated his 2021 book on treaty settlements, &quot;He Kupu Taurangi&quot;, to her.

In the health portfolio, Turia was responsible for Māori health, disability support services, communicable diseases, sexual health, diabetes, tobacco and women&#x27;s health. In 2010, the National and Māori Parties announced Whānau Ora, a taskforce designed to streamline social service resources. She led the government&#x27;s Smokefree 2025 policy which was launched in 2011 and included plain packaging and increased excise taxes for cigarettes. On 7 April 2011, the composition of the Abortion Supervisory Committee was debated. Turia moved that an anti-abortion Pacific Island doctor, Ate Moala, be appointed to the Committee. The vote was lost 67–31 against, with twenty four absences or abstentions. As associate housing minister, Turia launched a ten-year strategy to improve housing for Māori in 2014.

Turia confirmed in November 2013 that she would retire at the . She gave her valedictory statement on 24 July 2014. She was succeeded as co-leader of the Māori Party by Marama Fox on 31 October, after Fox&#x27;s election to Parliament that September. Turia&#x27;s relation Adrian Rurawhe, the Labour Party candidate, won her former electorate.

==Life after Parliament==

Turia held various government appointments, particularly in Māori development and health. She supported the development of the Crown apology for actions at Parihaka as part of its Treaty of Waitangi claim settlement with Taranaki iwi in 2015. In 2016, health minister Jonathan Coleman appointed Turia to be a member of the Whanganui District Health Board. In 2017, Turia was appointed a representative of Te Awa Tupua, the legal identity of the Whanganui River after it was given legal personhood. She continued in that role until 2021. 

Turia campaigned against the End of Life Choice Bill in 2019, saying that it would undermine whānau (family) values. She endorsed Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, the Māori Party candidate, for the Te Tai Hauāuru electorate in the 2020 general election. However, in the 2023 general election, Turia supported the National Party candidate, her relative Harete Hipango, over Ngarewa-Packer. 

In 2022, Turia drew media attention for her anti-vaccination views and opposition to mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 February 2022, Turia accused prime minister Jacinda Ardern of having Nazi sympathies on Radio New Zealand, in an interview about the Sixth Labour Government&#x27;s response to the 2022 Wellington anti-vaccination protests. She falsely claimed that Ardern had been filmed as a student doing &quot;almost a Heil Hitler salute.&quot;

In conversations about co-governance in 2023, she said she preferred rangatiratanga (self-determination) for iwi. Following the 2023 New Zealand general election, Turia expressed support for the incoming Sixth National Government&#x27;s plan to scrap Te Aka Whai Ora (the Māori Health Authority). She opined that she would rather see funding being given directly to whānau, iwi and hapū to allow them to manage their own health needs. While Turia praised John Key and Bill English for the Fifth National Government&#x27;s progress on Māori health, she criticised the outgoing Labour Government for allegedly not taking &quot;into account the differences in the way people view things&quot;.

==Death==
Turia died at Whangaehu Marae, Whangaehu, on 3 January 2025, at the age of 80, after suffering a stroke. That afternoon, her body was taken to lie at Pākaitore, before being carried by waka on the Whanganui River to Pūtiki Marae, and then returned to Whangaehu Marae. Her burial took place there on 7 January.

Turia attracted cross-party tributes from prime minister Christopher Luxon, former prime ministers John Key, Bill English and Chris Hipkins, former attorney-general Chris Finlayson and former United Future leader Peter Dunne, that focused on her &quot;principled leadership&quot; and bravery.

New Zealand First MP Shane Jones criticised protocol at Turia&#x27;s tangihanga (funeral), which prohibited tributes from people not speaking te reo Māori. Labour MP Willie Jackson said that the Labour Party should consider a formal apology to Turia&#x27;s whānau over her treatment during her departure from the party.

==Honours and awards==

In the 2015 New Year Honours, Turia was appointed a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services as a Member of Parliament. Her investiture, by the governor-general, Dame Patsy Reddy, took place at Pūtiki Marae on 13 August 2018. Also in 2018, Turia received the Blake Medal at the annual Sir Peter Blake Leadership Awards. In 2023, Turia was conferred an honorary doctorate in Māori development by Te Whare Wānanga o Awanuiārangi, in recognition of her &quot;continuing dedication and service to her iwi, to Māori and to the community in a career that has been distinguished by unprecedented firsts over the last five decades&quot;.

== Books ==
&quot;Walking the Talk: A Collection of Tariana&#x27;s papers&quot; was published in 2005 by Te Wānanga o Raukawa. It collects speeches given by Turia that reflect the kaupapa and early development of the Māori Party.

Turia&#x27;s biography, &quot;Crossing the Floor&quot;, was written by her former chief of staff, Helen Leahy, and published by Huia in 2015.

<text>HMS &quot;Dunkirk&quot; (D09) was a later or 1943 fleet destroyer of the British Royal Navy (RN). Though there were other ships of the Navy that had been named &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, as far back as the 1650s, it held added meaning after the evacuation from Dunkirk between late May and early June 1940, in which over 300,000 British, as well as French troops, were rescued by a ragtag fleet of ships.

&quot;Dunkirk&quot; was built by Alexander Stephen and Sons of Govan. She was launched on 27 August 1945 and commissioned on 27 November 1946.

==Service==
In the year of her commissioning, &quot;Dunkirk&quot; joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet. In 1950, &quot;Dunkirk&quot; was placed in Reserve, as were many of her sister ships in the 1950s. She subsequently performed a variety of duties and in 1958, while in the Mediterranean, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, in broad daylight, was hit by her sister ship during Officer of the Watch manoeuvres off Malta, causing minor damage.

In 1961, &quot;Dunkirk&quot;, along with the cruiser and the frigate , undertook a tour of the South American continent. Instead of returning home to the UK from the deployment&#x27;s culmination &quot;Dunkirk&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean to take up the duties of , a of the 7th Destroyer Squadron, based in the Mediterranean, which had experienced some engine problems and therefore had to be replaced. &quot;Dunkirk&quot; finally returned home in 1963.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In 1965 &quot;Dunkirk&quot; was listed as &#x27;reserve&#x27; and later that year was scrapped at Faslane.

<text>The Pre-Pyrenees are the foothills of the Pyrenees.

==Description==
As a mountainous system the Pre-Pyrenees are part of the Pyrenees. They run parallel to the main mountain range in a west to east direction.

On the French side the Pyrenees&#x27;s slopes descend rather abruptly, thus on the northern side, the Pre-Pyrenees are confined to the Corbières Massif, towards the eastern end of the mountain system. The Massif de Plantaurel further west deserves mention as well, although not as clearly a foothill.

On the Iberian side, however, the picture is very different: a large and complex system of foothill ranges stretches from Navarre, across northern Aragon, reaching the Mediterranean coast on the Catalan end of the Pyrenees. At the eastern end on the southern side lies a distinct area known as the Sub-Pyrenees.

==Main ranges==
Although the highest peaks in the Pre-Pyrenees are not as high as those in the Pyrenees proper, some of the ranges are quite massive, with summits reaching up to .

===Northern slope===
*Corbières Massif
*Massif de Plantaurel

===Southern slope===

* Early 1980s: The James A. Baker Institute for Animal Health develops the modified live-virus vaccine for canine parvovirus type 2, still in use today.
* 2005: Cornell launches one of the first comprehensive shelter medicine programs in the country, supported by Maddie&#x27;s Fund, called Maddie&#x27;s Shelter Medicine Program at Cornell University.
* 2006: A Cornell horse named Twilight serves as genome donor for the international Equine Whole Genome Sequencing Project.
* 2015: Research at the James A. Baker Institute for Animal Health leads to the first puppies born by in vitro fertilization.
* 2020: The college established the Cornell COVID-19 Testing Laboratory in collaboration with the Cayuga Health System to provide in-house COVID-19 tests for Cornell staff, students, and faculty, allowing the university to reopen and hold in-person study during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2022, it passed 2 million tests.

==Academic programs==

The College of Veterinary Medicine is an internationally recognized institution of public health, biomedical research, and veterinary medicine education. It is one of 30 veterinary colleges in the country, and one of only three in the Northeastern United States. The core mission of the college is to advance the health and well-being of animals and people through education, research, and public service.

&quot;Doctor of veterinary medicine (D.V.M.) program&quot;: The D.V.M. program provides student instruction in the biological basis of medicine, training in primary and referral veterinary care in the Cornell University Hospital for Animals, and instructed practice in the Small Animal Community Practice. Direct access to numerous innovative dairy farms in the upstate New York region, as well as the Cornell Dairy Barn, facilitate training in food animal medicine.

&quot;Master&#x27;s degree programs&quot;: The college houses a Master of Public Health (M.P.H.) Program and a Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.) Program. The M.P.H. Program prepares students through training on diverse public health issues at municipal, state, national, and international levels. The M.P.S. Program is designed for working individuals who seek to enhance their careers with specialized professional training in veterinary parasitology.

&quot;Ph.D. and research programs&quot;: The Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine&#x27;s Biomedical and Biological Sciences Program is an interdisciplinary program that trains students in basic, clinical, and translational life sciences research alongside faculty mentors and other research professionals. It has a Ph.D. track and a combined Ph.D. and D.V.M. track.

&quot;Other professional training&quot;: The Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine regularly hires postdoctoral associates in its departments, centers, and institutes. The Cornell University Hospital for Animals additionally offers preceptorship training for licensed veterinary technician students, including a wildlife preceptorship.

==Cornell University Hospital for Animals==

College founders taught and practiced veterinary medicine on Cornell&#x27;s campus as early as 1896 and multiple clinical spaces were built over the years. Currently, the Cornell University Hospital for Animals is a collection of seven hospitals in New York and Connecticut.

*Companion Animal Hospital
*Cornell Equine Hospital
*Cornell Ruffian Equine Specialists
*Cornell University Veterinary Specialists
*Janet L. Swanson Wildlife Hospital
*Nemo Farm Animal Hospital
*Small Animal Community Practice

The current Ithaca space was built in 1996, and houses three of Cornell&#x27;s animal hospitals: The Companion Animal Hospital, the Cornell Equine Hospital, and the Nemo Farm Animal Hospital. It&#x27;s also the home of the hospital&#x27;s Ambulatory Service, which makes on-site visits to dairies and farms throughout the region. The college opened Cornell&#x27;s Small Animal Community Practice next door in 2018, which enables students to learn business and management skills, and is where Maddie&#x27;s ® Shelter Medicine Program at Cornell University primarily operates.

Also in Ithaca is the college&#x27;s Janet L. Swanson Wildlife hospital, located in a nearby facility next to the Baker Institute for Animal Health and the Cornell Feline Health Center. Another clinical space near campus is the Cornell Equine Park, which primarily functions as a learning lab for veterinary students and researchers interested in theriogenology and/or sports medicine and rehabilitation.

In 2011, the college opened its first satellite hospital: Cornell University Veterinary Specialists, located in Stamford, Connecticut. This was followed in 2014 by the second satellite hospital: Cornell Ruffian Equine Specialists in Belmont, New York.

In 2015 and 2016, some controversy at the college surrounded clinician care.

According to the college&#x27;s most recent annual report, the Cornell University Hospital for Animals saw 30,083 cases in fiscal year 2021. Canine patients were the most common at 20,056 cases, followed by 4,761 feline cases; 1,429 equine cases; 1,319 avian and wildlife cases; 143 bovine cases; 1,659 cases of all other large animals; and 3,072 cases of all other small animals.
